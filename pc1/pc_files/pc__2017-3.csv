In this first-in-human, phase 0, exploratory study, we investigated the feasibility and safety of the MCA for the detection of prostate cancer (PCa) in men using clinical standard technology.  Materials and methods:   Imaging with the MCA was performed in 24 patients with biopsy-proven PCa scheduled for radical prostatectomy using a clinical ultrasound scanner at low acoustic power. Safety monitoring was done by physical examination, blood pressure and heart rate measurements, electrocardiogram, and blood sampling. As first-in-human study, MCA dosing and imaging protocol were necessarily fine-tuned along the enrollment to improve visualization. Imaging data were correlated with radical prostatectomy histopathology to analyze the detection rate of ultrasound molecular imaging with the MCA.  Results:   Imaging with MCA doses of 0.03 and 0.05 mL/kg was adequate to obtain contrast enhancement images up to 30 minutes after administration. No serious adverse events or clinically meaningful changes in safety monitoring data were identified during or after administration. BR55 dosing and imaging were fine-tuned in the first 12 patients leading to 12 subsequent patients with an improved MCA dosing and imaging protocol. Twenty-three patients underwent radical prostatectomy. A total of 52 lesions were determined to be malignant by histopathology with 26 (50%) of them seen during BR55 imaging. In the 11 patients that were scanned with the improved protocol and underwent radical prostatectomy, a total of 28 malignant lesions were determined: 19 (68%) were seen during BR55 ultrasound molecular imaging, whereas 9 (32%) were not identified.  Conclusions:   Ultrasound molecular imaging with BR55 is feasible with clinical standard technology and demonstrated a good safety profile. Detectable levels of the MCA can be reached in patients with PCa opening the way for further clinical trials.""","""['Martijn Smeenge', 'François Tranquart', 'Christophe K Mannaerts', 'Theo M de Reijke', 'Marc J van de Vijver', 'M Pilar Laguna', 'Sibylle Pochon', 'Jean J M C H de la Rosette', 'Hessel Wijkstra']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""[]"""

Positional cloning and linkage studies mapped Hereditary Prostate Cancer 1 (HPC1) to RNASEL. To date, there is no correlation of viral infections with prostate cancer, suggesting that RNase L may play additional roles in tumor suppression. Here, we demonstrate a role of RNase L as a suppressor of androgen receptor (AR) signaling, cell migration and matrix metalloproteinase activity. Using RNase L mutants, we show that its nucleolytic activity is dispensable for both AR signaling and migration. The most prevalent HPC1-associated mutations in RNase L, R462Q and E265X, enhance AR signaling and cell migration. RNase L negatively regulates cell migration and attachment on various extracellular matrices. We demonstrate that RNase L knockdown cells promote increased cell surface expression of integrin β1 which activates Focal Adhesion Kinase-Sarcoma (FAK-Src) pathway and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1-guanosine triphosphatase (Rac1-GTPase) activity to increase cell migration. Activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 is significantly increased in cells where RNase L levels are ablated. We show that mutations in RNase L found in HPC patients may promote prostate cancer by increasing expression of AR-responsive genes and cell motility and identify novel roles of RNase L as a prostate cancer susceptibility gene.""","""['Shubham Dayal', 'Jun Zhou', 'Praveen Manivannan', 'Mohammad Adnan Siddiqui', 'Omaima Farid Ahmad', 'Matthew Clark', 'Sahezeel Awadia', 'Rafael Garcia-Mata', 'Lirim Shemshedini', 'Krishnamurthy Malathi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['RNase L is a negative regulator of cell migration.', 'Interaction between the androgen receptor and RNase L mediates a cross-talk between the interferon and androgen signaling pathways.', ""A transcriptional signaling pathway in the IFN system mediated by 2'-5'-oligoadenylate activation of RNase L."", 'Implications for RNase L in prostate cancer biology.', 'Involvement of the RNAse L gene in prostate cancer.', 'Occludin Regulates HIV-1 Infection by Modulation of the Interferon Stimulated OAS Gene Family.', 'Occludin regulates HIV-1 infection by modulation of the interferon stimulated OAS gene family.', 'Human Melanoma Cells Differentially Express RNASEL/RNase-L and miR-146a-5p under Sex Hormonal Stimulation.', 'Identification of a 5-Gene-Based Scoring System by WGCNA and LASSO to Predict Prognosis for Rectal Cancer Patients.', 'Advancement and properties of circular RNAs in prostate cancer: An emerging and compelling frontier for discovering.']"""

Recent technical advances in multiparametric-MRI have markedly improved detection of PCa of the TZ. However, there are many diagnostic challenges that we still encounter in our daily practice that compromise the accuracy of the diagnosis. By performing both MRI-guided and ultrasound/MRI fusion-guided biopsies, we have gained extensive experience in the diagnosis of PCa of the TZ. Biopsy-proven examples including but not limited to typical and atypical PCa of the TZ as well as a wide variety of its mimics will be presented.

Long-term REST knockdown enhanced the expression of Twist1 and CD44, cell migration and sphere formation. Overexpression of REST in hormone-refractory CWR22Rv1 PCa cells significantly reduces Twist1 and CD44 expression, cell migration and sphere formation.

In our practice, we identified that prostate cancer co-existed with other primary cancers even in noncontiguous regions of the body and this co-existence impacted on our management of these patients.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively studied a 2-year period (June 2012-July 2014), the records of patients in our hospital with prostate cancer, who in addition, had other primary cancers; and studied the management and outcomes of these patients. We also reviewed the existing literatures for possible biologic links between prostatic carcinoma and other primary tumors.  Results:   There were six patients with multiple primary cancers who had prostate cancers. The age range was 60-84 years and the mean age of 72.2 ± 0.4 years. The primary tumors co-existing with prostate cancer were colonic adenocarcinoma, rectal adenocarcinoma, urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma, primary liver cell carcinoma, and thyroid follicular carcinoma in both synchronous and metachronous relationships.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancers often co-exist with other cancers. The precise mechanism by which prostate cancer co-exists with another primary cancer is yet to be clearly defined. With more study of the syndromic cancers involving the prostate, definite associations could be identified, and this may help in managing these patients better.""","""['A A Popoola', 'O O Abiola', 'T Buhari', 'A F Ushie', 'H B Olanipekun', 'A K Arogundade']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Niger J Clin Pract""","""['Synchronous primary cancers of urinary bladder and kidney and prostate.', 'Simultaneous presentation of adenocarcinoma of prostate and transitional cell carcinoma of bladder.', 'Incidental prostate cancer in patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma: comprehensive analysis of 1,476 radical cystoprostatectomy specimens.', 'Prostatic involvement by urothelial carcinoma in patients with bladder cancer and their implications in the clinical practice.', 'Triple primary malignant neoplasms including a malignant brain tumor: report of two cases and review of the literature.']"""

They are more likely to succumb to this tumor than their White counterparts and may benefit from early detection and treatment. In this study, we assess the nationwide and regional disparity in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer between Black men and non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs).  Methods:   A total of 247,079 (weighted 55,185,102) men, aged 40 to 99 years, who responded to the 2012 and 2014 behavioral risk factor surveillance system surveys were used for our analysis. End points consisted of self-reported PSA screening and self-reported nonrecommended PSA screening within 12 months of the interview. The latter was defined as screening in men with <10-year life expectancy. Available sociodemographic variables were used to predict these end points. The independent predictors from multivariate models were used to calculate the adjusted prevalence of PSA screening and nonrecommended PSA screening on a nationwide and regional level. These numbers were calculated for Blacks and NHWs separately and were compared between the 2 groups.  Results:   Prevalence of PSA screening was 30.7% in NHWs vs. 28.1% in Blacks (P<0.001). On a region-based analysis, New England, Middle Atlantic, South Atlantic, East North Central, East South Central, West South Central, and Mountain showed a significantly higher rate of PSA screening in NHWs as compared to Blacks (all P<0.001). Middle Atlantic had a significantly higher prevalence of nonrecommended screening in NHWs as compared to Blacks, whereas South Atlantic, West South Central, and Pacific had a significantly higher prevalence of nonrecommended screening in Blacks as compared to NHWs (all P<0.001). Overall, 43 states performed screening more frequently to NHWs, whereas only 8 states performed it more frequently to Black men. The nonrecommended screening was performed more frequently to NHWs in 19 states, whereas 24 states performed it more frequently to Black men.  Conclusion:   Our study demonstrates that on a regional-level (and state-level), there are significant racial differences in overall and nonrecommended PSA screening across the United States. Further research is necessary to identify the reasons for the differences and help overcoming it.""","""['Tarun Jindal', 'Naveen Kachroo', 'Jesse Sammon', 'Deepansh Dalela', 'Akshay Sood', 'Malte W Vetterlein', 'Patrick Karabon', 'Wooju Jeong', 'Mani Menon', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Firas Abdollah']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Does Veteran Status Mitigate Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer Screening?

Nerve-specific fluorescence guided surgery offers a potential solution by enhancing nerve visualization intraoperatively. However, the prostate is highly innervated and only the cavernous nerve structures require preservation to maintain continence and potency. Systemic administration of a nerve-specific fluorophore would lower nerve signal to background ratio (SBR) in vital nerve structures, making them difficult to distinguish from all nervous tissue in the pelvic region. A direct administration methodology to enable selective nerve highlighting for enhanced nerve SBR in a specific nerve structure has been developed herein. The direct administration methodology demonstrated equivalent nerve-specific contrast to systemic administration at optimal exposure times. However, the direct administration methodology provided a brighter fluorescent nerve signal, facilitating nerve-specific fluorescence imaging at video rate, which was not possible following systemic administration. Additionally, the direct administration methodology required a significantly lower fluorophore dose than systemic administration, that when scaled to a human dose falls within the microdosing range. Furthermore, a dual fluorophore tissue staining method was developed that alleviates fluorescence background signal from adipose tissue accumulation using a spectrally distinct adipose tissue specific fluorophore.

Analyzing readmission rates may serve as a proxy for postoperative morbidity and functional decline, allowing patients and physicians to make informed decisions about treatment.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis was performed of patients with metastatic spine disease surgically treated at a tertiary center from 2003 to 2012. Patients with primary lung cancer, breast cancer, kidney cancer, bone marrow cancer, prostate cancer, gynecologic cancer, and melanoma were analyzed. Primary and secondary outcome variables were readmissions and overall survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent factors associated with readmissions.  Results:   There were 159 patients analyzed. Lung, breast, and kidney represented the most common primary cancer sites, accounting for 22%, 19.5%, and 16.4%. Of patients, 56.6% had at least 1 readmission, with a 30-day readmission rate of 13.8% and 1-year readmission rate of 47.2%. Readmissions were for surgical complications (26.7%), oncologic disease progression (33.7%), and other medical reasons (36.7%). Patients with colorectal cancer had the highest number of readmissions. Patients with melanoma had more readmissions over the course of their limited postoperative survival. Overall mortality was 59.1%, with a median survival of 15.1 months. Multivariate analysis revealed age >60 years and previous radiation of the spine increased the likelihood of readmission.

To capitalize on the discovery of RM-532-105, a steroidal 17β-HSD3 inhibitor, we explored the effect of its backbone configuration on inhibitory activity, androgenic profile, and metabolic stability. Two modifications that greatly alter the natural shape of steroids, i.e. inversion of the methyl on carbon 13 (13α-CH3 instead of 13β-CH3) and inversion of the hydrogen on carbon 5 (5β-H instead of 5α-H), were tested after the syntheses in 6 steps of 2 isomeric forms (5α/13α-RM-532-105 (6a) and 5β/13β-RM-532-105 (6b), respectively) of the 17β-HSD3 inhibitor RM-532-105 (5α/13β-configurations). For compound 6b, a cis/trans junction of the A/B rings did not significantly alter the inhibitory activity on 17β-HSD3 (IC50=0.15μM) as well as the liver microsomal stability (16.6% of 6b remaining after 1h incubation) compared to RM-532-105 (IC50=0.11μM and 14.1% remaining). In contrast, a trans/cis junction of C/D rings reduced the inhibitory activity on 17β-HSD3 (IC50=1.09μM) but increased the metabolic stability with 29.4% of compound 6a remaining after incubation.

The conjugation of Atg5-Atg12 and the subsequent interaction with the positive regulator Atg16L1 are essential for the conjugation of Atg8 to PE and the subsequent formation of autophagosomes.

The presence of androgen receptor (AR) in RCC has recently been shown to be associated with higher tumour stage irrespective of gender. Because the clinical context of androgens in female RCC patients is similar to that of prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen-deprivation therapy, mechanisms underlying the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) may be at play in AR-positive RCC cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that AR-positive RCC has intratumoral steroidogenesis and that anti-androgen therapy may result in tumour suppression.  Methods:   Mice were injected with an AR-positive RCC cell line. When tumours became palpable, surgical castration was performed and tumour volume was measured. Using ELISA, the levels of intracellular testosterone and dihydrotesterone were measured in AR-positive human RCC cell lines. Lastly, male mice containing xenografts were treated with enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate (AA) for 3 weeks to measure tumour volume.  Results:   We first observed in vivo that castration retards the growth of AR-positive RCC tumour xenograft in mice. Next, AR-positive human RCC cell lines and tissues were found to have elevated levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone and express key enzymes required for intracellular androgen biosynthesis. A mouse xenograft study with AR-positive RCC cell line using the commonly used anti-androgen therapies showed significant tumour suppression (P<0.01).

In recent years, targeting multiple chaperones and co-chaperones (e.g., Hsp27, FKBP52) that promote androgen receptor (AR) signaling and/or novel AR regulatory mechanisms have emerged as promising alternative treatments for CRPC. We have shown that inactivation of inhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4), a dominant-negative helix loop helix protein, promotes de novo steroidogenesis and CRPC with a gene expression signature that resembles constitutive AR activity in castrated mice. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism through which loss of ID4 potentiates AR signaling. Proteomic analysis between prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (L+ns) and LNCaP lacking ID4 (L(-)ID4) revealed elevated levels of Hsp27 and FKBP52, suggesting a role for these AR-associated co-chaperones in promoting constitutively active AR signaling in L(-)ID4 cells. Interestingly, protein interaction studies demonstrated a direct interaction between ID4 and the 52-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP52) in vitro, but not with AR.

The present study investigated the expression and correlation of miRNA-509-5p and MDM2 to determine the mechanism of their function in invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells. RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of miRNA-509-5p and MDM2 in tumor, tumor-adjacent, and normal tissues, obtained from prostate cancer patients, using the HGC-27 cell line as an in vitro model. Cultured HGC-27 cells were transfected with miRNA-509-5p mimics, miRNA-509-5p inhibitor, and mimic control. Expression levels of miRNA-509-5p and MDM2 were quantified by RT-PCR. Cell proliferation and invasion/migration were examined by the MTT and transwell assays, respectively. MiRNA-509-5p was significantly down-regulated in prostate cancer cells exhibiting high MDM2 mRNA levels. MiRNA mimic transfection elevated miRNA levels and suppressed MDM2 expression. With prolonged incubation time, the proliferation ratio and OD values of miRNA-509-5p mimic transfected cells decreased, along with decrease in cell migration and invasion. These results suggested that miRNA-509-5p negatively regulates MDM2 expression via targeting the 3'-UTR of genes. As a novel tumor suppressor, miRNA-509-5p in prostate cancer HGC-27 cells can suppress MDM2 expression and inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, and migration.

Enzalutamide is highly protein bound and eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism; therefore, it is important to understand whether enzalutamide pharmacokinetics is altered by hepatic impairment.  Methods:   Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from two non-randomized, open-label, single-dose, phase 1 studies conducted in patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A, n = 6) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B, n = 8) hepatic impairment (NCT01901133) or severe (Child-Pugh class C, n = 8) hepatic impairment (NCT02138162) and their corresponding matched healthy controls; data from both studies are presented here. Subjects with hepatic impairment had liver cirrhosis (n = 19) or chronic hepatitis (n = 3). All subjects received a single oral dose of 160 mg enzalutamide under fasting conditions, with blood samples collected predose and up to 49 days post-dose.  Results and discussion:   Exposure to enzalutamide active moieties, based on the area under the curve of the sum of enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide (an active metabolite with similar potency to enzalutamide), increased by 13%, 18% and 4% in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to matched controls. Compared with healthy controls, the mean maximum plasma concentration for enzalutamide active moieties was 24% higher in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 11% and 41% lower in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. Enzalutamide was generally well tolerated, with no clinically significant trends in abnormal laboratory findings, vital signs or electrocardiograms.  What is new and conclusions:   No major differences in single-dose pharmacokinetics were observed in subjects with hepatic impairment vs. matched healthy controls.

In three spontaneous murine cancers (prostate cancers in TRAMP and PTEN mice, pancreatic cancer in KPC mice), we identified two subpopulations with distinct niche construction adaptive strategies that remained stable in culture: (i) invasive cells that produce an acidic environment via upregulated aerobic glycolysis; and (ii) noninvasive cells that were angiogenic and metabolically near-normal. Darwinian interactions of these subpopulations were investigated in TRAMP prostate cancers. Computer simulations demonstrated invasive, acid-producing (C2) cells maintain a fitness advantage over noninvasive, angiogenic (C3) cells by promoting invasion and reducing efficacy of immune response. Immunohistochemical analysis of untreated tumors confirmed that C2 cells were invariably more abundant than C3 cells. However, the C2 adaptive strategy phenotype incurred a significant cost due to inefficient energy production (i.e., aerobic glycolysis) and depletion of resources for adaptations to an acidic environment. Mathematical model simulations predicted that small perturbations of the microenvironmental extracellular pH (pHe) could invert the cost/benefit ratio of the C2 strategy and select for C3 cells. In vivo, 200 mmol/L NaHCO3 added to the drinking water of 4-week-old TRAMP mice increased the intraprostatic pHe by 0.2 units and promoted proliferation of noninvasive C3 cells, which remained confined within the ducts so that primary cancer did not develop. A 0.2 pHe increase in established tumors increased the fraction of C3 cells and signficantly diminished growth of primary and metastatic tumors. In an experimental tumor construct, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were coinjected into the mammary fat pad of SCID mice. C2-like MDA-MB-231 cells dominated in untreated animals, but C3-like MCF7 cells were selected and tumor growth slowed when intratumoral pHe was increased. Overall, our data support the use of mathematical modeling of intratumoral Darwinian interactions of environmental selection forces and cancer cell adaptive strategies. These models allow the tumor to be steered into a less invasive pathway through the application of small but selective biological force.

Objectives:   To determine the long-term effects of different exercise modes on fatigue in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 2009 and 2012, 163 prostate cancer patients aged 43-90 y on ADT were randomised to exercise targeting the musculoskeletal system (impact loading+resistance training; ILRT; n=58), the cardiovascular and muscular systems (aerobic+resistance training; ART; n=54), or to usual care/delayed exercise (DEL; n=51) for 12 mo across university-affiliated exercise clinics in Australia.  Intervention:   Supervised ILRT for 12 mo, supervised ART for 6 mo followed by a 6-mo home program, and DEL received a printed booklet on exercise information for 6 mo followed by 6-mo stationary cycling exercise.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Fatigue was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 36 and vitality using the Short Form-36. Analysis of variance was used to compare outcomes for groups at 6 mo and 12 mo.  Results and limitations:   Fatigue was reduced (p=0.005) in ILRT at 6 mo and 12 mo (∼5 points), and in ART (p=0.005) and DEL (p=0.022) at 12 mo. Similarly, vitality increased for all groups (p≤0.001) at 12 mo (∼4 points). Those with the highest levels of fatigue and lowest vitality improved the most with exercise (ptrend<0.001). A limitation was inclusion of mostly well-functioning individuals.  Conclusions:   Different exercise modes have comparable effects on reducing fatigue and enhancing vitality during ADT. Patients with the highest levels of fatigue and lowest vitality had the greatest benefits.  Patient summary:   We compared the effects of different exercise modes on fatigue in men on androgen deprivation therapy. All exercise programs reduced fatigue and enhanced vitality. We conclude that undertaking some form of exercise will help reduce fatigue, especially in those who are the most fatigued.""","""['Dennis R Taaffe', 'Robert U Newton', 'Nigel Spry', 'David Joseph', 'Suzanne K Chambers', 'Robert A Gardiner', 'Brad A Wall', 'Prue Cormie', 'Kate A Bolam', 'Daniel A Galvão']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['A multicentre year-long randomised controlled trial of exercise training targeting physical functioning in men with prostate cancer previously treated with androgen suppression and radiation from TROG 03.04 RADAR.', 'Body composition, fatigue and exercise in patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Can supervised exercise prevent treatment toxicity in patients with prostate cancer initiating androgen-deprivation therapy: a randomised controlled trial.', 'Effects of exercise on treatment-related adverse effects for patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: a systematic review.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy: evidence-based management of side effects.', 'Moderators of exercise effects on self-reported cognitive functioning in cancer survivors: an individual participant data meta-analysis.', 'Effects of exercise mode and intensity on patient-reported outcomes in cancer survivors: a four-arm intervention trial.', 'Home-based exercise improves quality of life in breast and prostate cancer survivors: A meta-analysis.', ""Dutch\xa0prostate cancer patients' views about exercise and experience with exercise advice: a national survey."", 'Exercise Training in Elderly Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review.']"""

However, one of the major obstacles in the treatment of these patients is docetaxel-resistance. Defining the mechanisms of resistance so as to inform subsequent treatment options and combinations represents a challenge for clinicians and scientists. Previous work by our group has shown complex changes in pro and anti-apoptotic proteins in the development of resistance to docetaxel. Targeting these changes individually does not significantly impact on the resistant phenotype but understanding the central signalling pathways and transcription factors (TFs) which control these could represent a more appropriate therapeutic targeting approach.  Methods:   Using a number of docetaxel-resistant sublines of PC-3 cells, we have undertaken a transcriptomic analysis by expression microarray using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array and in conjunction with bioinformatic analyses undertook to predict dysregulated TFs in docetaxel resistant prostate cancer. The clinical significance of this prediction was ascertained by performing immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of an identified TF (SRF) in the metastatic sites from men who died of advanced CRPC. Investigation of the functional role of SRF was examined by manipulating SRF using SiRNA in a docetaxel-resistant PC-3 cell line model.  Results:   The transcription factors identified include serum response factor (SRF), nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB), heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1), testicular receptor 2 & 4 (TR2 &4), vitamin-D and retinoid x receptor (VDR-RXR) and oestrogen-receptor 1 (ESR1), which are predicted to be responsible for the differential gene expression observed in docetaxel-resistance. IHC analysis to quantify nuclear expression of the identified TF SRF correlates with both survival from date of bone metastasis (p = 0.003), survival from androgen independence (p = 0.00002), and overall survival from prostate cancer (p = 0.0044). Functional knockdown of SRF by siRNA demonstrated a reversal of apoptotic resistance to docetaxel treatment in the docetaxel-resistant PC-3 cell line model.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that SRF could aid in treatment stratification of prostate cancer, and may also represent a therapeutic target in the treatment of men afflicted with advanced prostate cancer.""","""['D J Lundon', 'A Boland', 'M Prencipe', 'G Hurley', ""A O'Neill"", 'E Kay', 'S T Aherne', 'P Doolan', 'S F Madden', 'M Clynes', 'C Morrissey', 'J M Fitzpatrick', 'R W Watson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Identification of transcription factors associated with castration-resistance: is the serum responsive factor a potential therapeutic target?', 'The analysis of serum response factor expression in bone and soft tissue prostate cancer metastases.', 'Relationship between serum response factor and androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition regulators in prostate cancer: Androgens and beyond.', 'Identification of host transcriptome-guided repurposable drugs for SARS-CoV-1 infections and their validation with SARS-CoV-2 infections by using the integrated bioinformatics approaches.', 'Protein signatures to distinguish aggressive from indolent prostate cancer.', 'Genome-Wide Analysis and the Expression Pattern of the MADS-Box Gene Family in Bletilla striata.', 'Inhibition of Serum Response Factor Improves Response to Enzalutamide in Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-dependent phosphorylation and phospho-proteome targets in prostate cancer.']"""

Down-regulation of TRIM59 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo.

Materials and methods:   Between 2006 and 2015, 1148 patients were treated for bladder cancer and 3368 patients for BPH. Among them, 258 (22.5%) patients had both bladder cancer and BPH. 113 (11.6%) patients had indications for surgical treatment of both diseases. In this group, 18 (13.5%) patients also had bladder stones. Only 2 (1.6%) patients had tumor invading the muscle wall, while the remaining patients had non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.  Results:   In 18% of patients the surgery was done in two stages, the first for bladder cancer and the second for BPH. The remaining 82% of patients underwent simultaneous surgery. Bladder cancer recurred in 34.4% of patients.  Discussion:   Comparative evaluation of the results of transurethral resection of the bladder and prostate showed a greater number of intraoperative complications in patients who underwent staged surgery. In our opinion, it may be attributed to the lack of adequate visualization and access to the tumor, located near the opening of the ureter, to the intravesical prostate growth or large median lobe of the prostate. Bladder tumors greater than 3 cm, the multiple lesions and the low tumor differentiation were associated with a higher risk of bladder cancer recurrence, but recurrence rates of simultaneous and staged surgeries were not significantly different. The treatment of patients with bladder cancer in combination with BPH and bladder stones depended on the prostate volume, the number and size of stones.

There are studies underway aimed to develop and implement new methods for prostate cancer screening by tumor imaging and obtaining tissue samples from suspicious areas for morphological examination. One of these new methods is shear wave ultrasound elastography (SWUE). The current literature is lacking sufficient coverage of informativeness and specificity of SWUE in the prostate cancer detection, there is no clear criteria for assessing tissue stiffness at different values of PSA and tumor grade, and in prostate hyperplasia and prostatitis.  Aim:   To evaluate the informativeness and specificity of SWUE compared with other diagnostic methods.  Materials and methods:   SWUE has been used in the Clinic of Urology of Sechenov First MSMU since October 2015. During this period, 302 patients were examined using SWUE. SWUE was performed with Aixplorer ultrasound system (Super Sonic Imagine), which provides a single-stage SWUE imaging with both B-mode and real-time mode. The first group (prospective study) included 134 men aged 47 to 81 years with suspected prostate cancer scheduled to either initial or repeat prostate biopsy. PSA levels ranged from 4 to 24 ng/ml. The second group (retrospective study) comprised 120 men with confirmed prostate cancer and PSA levels between 4 and 90 ng/ml. The third group (the control group), comprised 48 healthy men whose PSA level did not exceed 3 ng/ml. All patients of the groups 1 and 2 underwent a standard comprehensive examination. Patients in group 1 were subsequently subjected to transrectal prostate biopsy guided by localization of areas with abnormal tissue stiffness. PCa was detected in 100 of 134 patients. 217 patients of groups 1 and 2 underwent radical prostatectomy. In 28 of them, the match between the cancer location and differentiation in the removed prostate and SWUE findings before surgery was examined. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of pelvic organs was performed in 63 patients of groups 1 and 2.  Results:   Threshold values of stiffness (Emean) were determined, which normally range from 0 to 23 kPa, from 23.4 to 50 kPa in prostatic hyperplasia and 50.5 kPa and greater in prostate cancer. A total of 220 patients in groups 1 and 2 were found to have prostate cancer. The findings showed increased stiffness of prostate tissue depending on tumor differentiation, Gleason score, and hence, cancer risk. The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for SWUE, biopsy based on 6 peripheral points used during SWUE, and for histologic findings from prostate cross sections. When compared to needle biopsy, Se, Sp, PPV, NPV for SWUE were 90.8, 94.6, 56.6 and 97.9%, respectively.

In addition, recent epidemiological assessments show a familial component in prostate cancer-specific survival, which could be due to either common genetics or environment. In this study we sought to estimate the heritability of prostate cancer-specific survival by studying brothers and father-son pairs in Sweden.  Methods:   We used linkage records from three Swedish national registers: the Multi-Generation Register, the Cancer Register, and the Cause of Death Register. One thousand seven hundred twenty-eight brother pairs and 6,444 father-son pairs, where both family members were diagnosed with prostate cancer, were followed for prostate cancer mortality. By assuming that (i) brothers on average share 50% of their segregating alleles and 100% environment and (ii) fathers and sons share 50% of their segregating alleles and no environment, we implemented a model including influences of additive genetics (heritability), shared environment and non-shared environment for survival data. A conditional likelihood estimation procedure was developed to fit the model. Data simulation was applied to validate model assumptions.  Results:   In a model that adjusted for age at diagnosis and calendar period, the estimated heritability of prostate cancer-specific survival was 0.10 (95% CI = 0.00-0.20) that was borderline significantly different from zero (P = 0.057). The shared environment component was not significantly different from zero with a point estimate of 0.00 (95% CI = 0.00-0.13). Simulation studies and sensitivity analysis revealed that the estimated heritability component was robust, whereas the shared environmental component may be underestimated.  Conclusions:   Heritability of prostate cancer-specific survival is considerably lower than for prostate cancer incidence. This supports a hypothesis that susceptibility of disease and progression of disease are separate mechanisms that involve different genes. Further assessment of the genetic basis of prostate cancer-specific survival is warranted.

Here, we report the detailed characterization of four novel murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing human PSMA as well as PSMA orthologs from different species.  Methods:   Performance of purified mAbs was assayed using a comprehensive panel of in vitro experimental setups including Western blotting, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, flow cytometry, and surface-plasmon resonance. Furthermore, a mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer was used to compare the suitability of the mAbs for in vivo applications.  Results:   All mAbs demonstrate high specificity for PSMA as documented by the lack of cross-reactivity to unrelated human proteins. The 3F11 and 1A11 mAbs bind linear epitopes spanning residues 226-243 and 271-288 of human PSMA, respectively. 3F11 is also suitable for the detection of PSMA orthologs from mouse, pig, dog, and rat in experimental setups where the denatured form of PSMA is used. 5D3 and 5B1 mAbs recognize distinct surface-exposed conformational epitopes and are useful for targeting PSMA in its native conformation. Most importantly, using a mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer we show that both the intact 5D3 and its Fab fragment are suitable for in vivo imaging.  Conclusions:   With apparent affinities of 0.14 and 1.2 nM as determined by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively, 5D3 has approximately 10-fold higher affinity for PSMA than the clinically validated mAb J591 and, therefore, is a prime candidate for the development of next-generation theranostics to target PSMA.

Although these cytokines interact with a common receptor complex, IFN-β showed a more potent antitumor activity than IFN-α in several tumor models. New recombinant human IFN-β products, such as IFN-β1a and IFN-β1b, have been produced in order to improve the stability and bioavailability of natural IFN-β. In this report, we analyzed the effects of recombinant IFN-β1a on the cell proliferation of two human androgen-resistant prostate cancer cell lines with neuroendocrine differentiation (DU-145, PC-3) and related mechanisms of action.  Methods:   The effects of IFN-β1a on the cell growth proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis have been evaluated in DU-145 and PC-3 cells through MTT assay, DNA flow cytometry with propidium iodide, and Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining, respectively. Moreover, the expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8, and PARP was evaluated through Western blotting.  Results:   IFN-β1a showed a significant anti-proliferative activity in both androgen-resistant cell lines.

Active monitoring of such side effects is essential for prevention and early intervention. In addition, the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapies is limited by primary and secondary resistance. The underlying molecular mechanism including splice variants of the androgen receptor in contrast to mutations are usually reversible and should be regarded as a sign of efficacy of the current treatment.

Methods:   We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study. All the clinical information of the study participants were acquired from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database for Catastrophic Illness Patients in Taiwan. We extracted data for all the patients newly diagnosed with prostate malignancy (ICD-9-CM 185 or C61 in ICD-10-CM) from 2000 to 2008. The patients were then divided into two groups: 7160 male ADT cohort receiving ADT and 7160 male non-ADT comparison group frequency matched by age and index year of ADT treatment of the ADT group. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the adjusted HR and 95% CIs of the IBS risk.  Results:   No significant difference was noted in the overall incidence rate for IBS between the ADT and non-ADT cohorts (0.86 and 0.89 per 1000 person-year, respectively, p=0.89). Even after adjusting for potential risk factors, a 1.06-fold risk of IBS (95% CI 0.62 to 1.82, p=0.82) was observed in the ADT cohort relative to the non-ADT cohorts. Moreover, we stratified the ADT cohort by time point of ADT treatment after PC diagnosis. Different IBS incidence rates were observed among the early ADT, late-ADT and non-ADT users at 0.77, 1.23 and 0.89 per 1000 person-years, respectively; nonetheless, the difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, no difference was found between the ADT treatment types and IBS risk, including sole orchiectomy, sole luteinising-hormone-releasing hormone and both.  Conclusions:   Results showed that ADT treatment in patients with PC is not an independent factor for IBS incidence. Large sample sizes for patients with IBS with patients with PC who had received ADT treatment are needed for further study.""","""['I-Ni Chiang', 'Chao-Yuan Huang', 'Yeong-Shiau Pu', 'Chao-Hsiang Chang', 'Chih-Hsin Muo', 'Chi-Jung Chung', 'Ruey-Yun Wang', 'Tai-Horng Young']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Type of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Risk of Dementia Among Patients With Prostate Cancer in Taiwan.', 'Increased Fall Risk in Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'No increased risk of dementia in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a 5-year follow-up study.', 'Stroke related to androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review.', 'Quantifying observational evidence for risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'The Interplay between Androgen and Gut Microbiota: Is There a Microbiota-Gut-Testis Axis.']"""

TTB induced ROS production in MDA-MB-231, A549, and HCT116 cells. Moreover, TTB enhanced DNA damage by inducing γH2AX foci formation and the phosphorylation of DNA damage-related proteins such as Chk2 and H2AX. Furthermore, TTB selectively inhibited STAT3 activation, which resulted in a reduction in cyclin D1, MMP-9, survivin, VEGF, and IL-6. In addition, TTB-induced ROS generation caused STAT3 inhibition, DNA damage, and apoptotic cell death.

Previous studies have shown an association between PHI and a tumor volume of >0.5 cm³. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between PHI and tumor volume as well as the Gleason score. A total of 196 selected patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy at our institution were included in our study. The tumor volume was calculated and preoperative serum parameters total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), [-2]proPSA, and PHI were evaluated. The association between the pathological findings such as Gleason score, pathological T-stage (pT stage), and tumor volume were evaluated. We further used logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard regression analyses for assessing the association between tumor volume and PHI and for predicting biochemical recurrence. With an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79, PHI is the most accurate predictor of a tumor volumes >0.5 cm³. Moreover, PHI correlates significantly with the tumor volume (r = 0.588), which is significantly different (p = 0.008) from the correlation of the Gleason score with tumor volume (r = 0.385). PHI correlates more strongly with the tumor volume than does the Gleason score.

We investigated whether MAN2A1-FER is expressed by human liver tumors and its role in liver carcinogenesis.  Methods:   We performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses of 102 non-small cell lung tumors, 61 ovarian tumors, 70 liver tumors, 156 glioblastoma multiform samples, 27 esophageal adenocarcinomas, and 269 prostate cancer samples, as well as 10 nontumor liver tissues and 20 nontumor prostate tissues, collected at the University of Pittsburgh. We also measured expression by 15 human cancer cell lines. We expressed a tagged form of MAN2A1-FER in NIH3T3 and HEP3B (liver cancer) cells; Golgi were isolated for analysis. MAN2A1-FER was also overexpressed in PC3 or DU145 (prostate cancer), NIH3T3 (fibroblast), H23 (lung cancer), and A-172 (glioblastoma multiforme) cell lines and knocked out in HUH7 (liver cancer) cells. Cells were analyzed for proliferation and in invasion assays, and/or injected into flanks of severe combined immunodeficient mice; xenograft tumor growth and metastasis were assessed. Mice with hepatic deletion of PTEN were given tail-vein injections of MAN2A1-FER.  Results:   We detected MAN2A1-FER messenger RNA and fusion protein (114 kD) in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HUH7, as well as in liver tumors, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, prostate tumors, non-small cell lung tumors, and ovarian tumors, but not nontumor prostate or liver tissues. MAN2A1-FER protein retained the signal peptide for Golgi localization from MAN2A1 and translocated from the cytoplasm to Golgi in cancer cell lines. MAN2A1-FER had tyrosine kinase activity almost 4-fold higher than that of wild-type FER, and phosphorylated the epidermal growth factor receptor at tyrosine 88 in its N-terminus. Expression of MAN2A1-FER in 4 cell lines led to epidermal growth factor receptor activation of BRAF, MEK, and AKT; HUH7 cells with MAN2A1-FER knockout had significant decreases in phosphorylation of these proteins. Cell lines that expressed MAN2A1-FER had increased proliferation, colony formation, and invasiveness and formed larger (>2-fold) xenograft tumors in mice, with more metastases, than cells not expressing the fusion protein. HUH7 cells with MAN2A1-FER knockout formed smaller xenograft tumors, with fewer metastases, than control HUH7 cells. HUH7, A-172, and PC3 cells that expressed MAN2A1-FER were about 2-fold more sensitive to the FER kinase inhibitor crizotinib and the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor canertinib; these drugs slowed growth of xenograft tumors from MAN2A1-FER cells and prevented their metastasis in mice. Hydrodynamic tail-vein injection of MAN2A1-FER resulted in rapid development of liver cancer in mice with hepatic disruption of Pten.

Engineering cysteine residues in the antibodies using mutagenesis is a common method to prepare site-specific ADCs. With this approach, solvent accessible amino acids in the antibody have been selected for substitution with cysteine for conjugating maleimide-bearing cytotoxic drugs, resulting in homogeneous and stable site-specific ADCs. Here we describe a cysteine engineering approach based on the insertion of cysteines before and after selected sites in the antibody, which can be used for site-specific preparation of ADCs. Cysteine-inserted antibodies have expression level and monomeric content similar to the native antibodies. Conjugation to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer (SG3249) resulted in comparable efficiency of site-specific conjugation between cysteine-inserted and cysteine-substituted antibodies. Cysteine-inserted ADCs were shown to have biophysical properties, FcRn, and antigen binding affinity similar to the cysteine-substituted ADCs. These ADCs were comparable for serum stability to the ADCs prepared using cysteine-mutagenesis and had selective and potent cytotoxicity against human prostate cancer cells. Two of the cysteine-inserted variants abolish binding of the resulting ADCs to FcγRs in vitro, thereby potentially preventing non-target mediated uptake of the ADCs by cells of the innate immune system that express FcγRs, which may result in mitigating off-target toxicities.

The endocrine-metabolic regulatory axis comprising growth hormone (GH), insulin and IGF1, which is drastically altered under extreme metabolic conditions such as obesity, also plays relevant roles in the development, modulation and homeostasis of the PG. However, its implication in the pathophysiological interplay between obesity and prostate function is still to be elucidated. To explore this association, we used a high fat-diet obese mouse model, as well as in vitro primary cultures of normal-mouse PG cells and human prostate cancer cell lines. This approach revealed that most of the components of the GH/insulin/IGF1 regulatory axis are present in PGs, where their expression pattern is altered under obesity conditions and after an acute insulin treatment (e.g. Igfbp3), which might have some pathophysiological implications. Moreover, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the PG becomes severely insulin resistant under diet-induced obesity in mice.

We aimed to describe the imaging response to radium-223 treatment.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated the computed tomography (CT) and bone scintigraphy response of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients treated with radium-223, in eight centers in three countries.  Results:   A total of 130 patients were included, the majority (n=84, 65%) received radium-223 post docetaxel. Thirty-four of 99 patients with available data (34%) received concomitant abiraterone or enzalutamide. A total of 54% (n=70) patients completed the planned six injections of radium-223. In patients with available data, a transient increase in bone metastases-related pain was observed in 27% (n=33/124) and an improvement of bone metastases-related pain on treatment with radium-223 was noted in 49% of patients (n=61/124). At 3 and 6 months of treatment with radium-223, bone imaging showed stable disease in 74% (n=84/113) and 94% of patients (n=93/99) with available data, respectively. An increase in the number of bone lesions was documented at 3 months compared with baseline in 26% (n=29/113) and at 6 months compared with 3 months in 6% of patients (n=6/99), respectively. Radiological extraskeletal disease progression occurred in 46% of patients (n=57/124) with available CT data at 3 and/or 6 months.  Conclusions:   Progression of bone metastases during radium-223 therapy is uncommon. A bone flare (pain and/or radiological) may be noted during the first 3 months, and should not be confused with progression. Imaging by CT scan should be considered after three and six doses of radium-223 to rule out extraskeletal disease progression.""","""['D Keizman', 'M O Fosboel', 'H Reichegger', 'A Peer', 'E Rosenbaum', 'M-C Desax', 'V Neiman', 'P M Petersen', 'J Mueller', 'R Cathomas', 'M Gottfried', 'H Dresler', 'D Sarid', 'W Mermershtain', 'K Rouvinov', 'J Mortensen', 'S Gillessen', 'G Daugaard', 'A Omlin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Re-treatment with radium-223: first experience from an international, open-label, phase I/II study in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.', 'Re-treatment with radium-223: 2-year follow-up from an international, open-label, phase 1/2 study in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.', 'Four years of clinical experience with Radium-223 for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Radionuclide Therapies in Prostate Cancer: Integrating Radium-223 in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluating radium-223 response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with imaging.', 'Radium-223 Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: Biomarkers for Stratification and Response Evaluation.', 'Interim and end-treatment 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT and bone scan in prostate cancer patients treated with Radium 223 dichloride.', 'Flare phenomenon in prostate cancer: recent evidence on new drugs and next generation imaging.', 'Evolving Natural History of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of Baseline and Post-Therapy 18F-FDG PET in the Prognostic Stratification of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Patients Treated with Radium-223.']"""

Herein, we examined the impact of carbohydrate restriction without calorie restriction on tumor development within the context of diet-induced obesity in the Hi-Myc transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Mice were randomized at 5 weeks of age to ad libitum western diet (WD; 40% fat, 42% carbohydrate; n=39) or ad libitum no carbohydrate ketogenic diet (NCKD; 82% fat, 1% carbohydrate; n=44). At age 3 or 6 months, mice were killed, prostates weighed and prostate histology, proliferation, apoptosis and macrophage infiltration evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin, Ki67, TUNEL and F4/80 staining, respectively. Body composition was assessed by DEXA, serum cytokines measured using multiplex, and Akt/mTOR signaling assessed by Western.  Results:   Caloric intake was higher in the NCKD group, resulting in elevated body weights at 6 months of age, relative to the WD group (45 g vs 38g; P=0.008). Despite elevated body weights, serum monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and interleukin (IL)-1α levels were lower in NCKD versus WD mice (P=0.046 and P=0.118, respectively), and macrophage infiltration was reduced in prostates of NCKD versus WD mice (P=0.028). Relative Akt phosphorylation and phospho-S6 ribosomal protein levels were reduced in prostates of NCKD versus WD mice. However, while mice randomized to NCKD had smaller prostates after adjustment for body weight at 3 and 6 months (P=0.004 and P=0.002, respectively), NCKD mice had higher rates of adenocarcinoma at 6 months compared to WD mice (100 vs 80%, P=0.04).  Conclusions:   Despite higher caloric intake and elevated body weights, carbohydrate restriction lowered serum MCP-1 levels, reduced prostate macrophage infiltration, reduced prostate weight, but failed to slow adenocarcinoma development. Together, these data suggest that although carbohydrate restriction within the context of obesity may reduce obesity-associated systemic inflammation and perhaps slow tumor growth, it is not sufficient to counteract obesity-associated tumor development.""","""['E H Allott', 'E Macias', 'S Sanders', 'B S Knudsen', 'G V Thomas', 'S D Hursting', 'S J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['The effects of varying dietary carbohydrate and fat content on survival in a murine LNCaP prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Carbohydrate restriction and lactate transporter inhibition in a mouse xenograft model of human prostate cancer.', 'Carbohydrate restriction, prostate cancer growth, and the insulin-like growth factor axis.', 'Low-carbohydrate diets cause obesity, low-carbohydrate diets reverse obesity: a metabolic mechanism resolving the paradox.', 'Atkins and other low-carbohydrate diets: hoax or an effective tool for weight loss?', 'Prostate tumor RON receptor signaling mediates macrophage recruitment to drive androgen deprivation therapy resistance through Gas6-mediated Axl and RON signaling.', 'Altering phosphoinositides in high-fat diet-associated prostate tumor xenograft growth.', 'Ketogenic Diet in Cancer Prevention and Therapy: Molecular Targets and Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Ketogenic diets consumed during radio-chemotherapy have beneficial effects on quality of life and metabolic health in patients with rectal cancer.', 'The role of IGF-1 in obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Twenty patients underwent a CT scan for planning intensity modulated radiation therapy-IGRT delivering 80 Gy to the prostate, followed by weekly CT scans. Two methods were used to obtain the dose distributions on the weekly CT scans: (1) recalculating the dose using the original treatment plan; and (2) rigidly propagating the planned dose distribution. The cumulative doses were then estimated in the organs at risk for each dose distribution by deformable image registration. The differences between recalculated and propagated doses were finally calculated for the fraction and the cumulative dose distributions, by use of per-voxel and dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics.  Results:   For the fraction dose, the mean per-voxel absolute dose difference was <1 Gy for 98% and 95% of the fractions for the rectum and bladder, respectively. The maximum dose difference within 1 voxel reached, however, 7.4 Gy in the bladder and 8.0 Gy in the rectum. The mean dose differences were correlated with gas volume for the rectum and patient external contour variations for the bladder. The mean absolute differences for the considered volume receiving greater than or equal to dose x (Vx) of the DVH were between 0.37% and 0.70% for the rectum and between 0.53% and 1.22% for the bladder. For the cumulative dose, the mean differences in the DVH were between 0.23% and 1.11% for the rectum and between 0.55% and 1.66% for the bladder. The largest dose difference was 6.86%, for bladder V80Gy. The mean dose differences were <1.1 Gy for the rectum and <1 Gy for the bladder.

The ML algorithm can mimic characteristics of preoperative treatment plans deemed clinically acceptable by brachytherapists. The planning efficiency, dosimetry, and quality (as assessed by experts) of preoperative plans generated with an ML planning approach was retrospectively evaluated in this study.  Methods and materials:   Preimplantation and postimplantation treatment plans were extracted from 100 high-quality LDR treatments and stored within a training database. The ML training algorithm matches similar features from a new LDR case to those within the training database to rapidly obtain an initial seed distribution; plans were then further fine-tuned using stochastic optimization. Preimplantation treatment plans generated by the ML algorithm were compared with brachytherapist (BT) treatment plans in terms of planning time (Wilcoxon rank sum, α = 0.05) and dosimetry (1-way analysis of variance, α = 0.05). Qualitative preimplantation plan quality was evaluated by expert LDR radiation oncologists using a Likert scale questionnaire.  Results:   The average planning time for the ML approach was 0.84 ± 0.57 minutes, compared with 17.88 ± 8.76 minutes for the expert planner (P=.020). Preimplantation plans were dosimetrically equivalent to the BT plans; the average prostate V150% was 4% lower for ML plans (P=.002), although the difference was not clinically significant. Respondents ranked the ML-generated plans as equivalent to expert BT treatment plans in terms of target coverage, normal tissue avoidance, implant confidence, and the need for plan modifications. Respondents had difficulty differentiating between plans generated by a human or those generated by the ML algorithm.  Conclusions:   Prostate LDR preimplantation treatment plans that have equivalent quality to plans created by brachytherapists can be rapidly generated using ML. The adoption of ML in the brachytherapy workflow is expected to improve LDR treatment plan uniformity while reducing planning time and resources.""","""['Alexandru Nicolae', 'Gerard Morton', 'Hans Chung', 'Andrew Loblaw', 'Suneil Jain', 'Darren Mitchell', 'Lin Lu', 'Joelle Helou', 'Motasem Al-Hanaqta', 'Emily Heath', 'Ananth Ravi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Conventional vs machine learning-based treatment planning in prostate brachytherapy: Results of a Phase I randomized controlled trial.', 'Intraoperative and post-implant dosimetry in patients treated with permanent prostate implant brachytherapy.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

Methods and materials:   Between 2002 and 2006, 303 men with low-risk to high-risk prostate cancer were randomized to 76 Gy in 38 fractions (CIMRT) versus 70.2 Gy in 26 fractions (HIMRT). QoL was compared by use of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and EuroQoL (EQ5D) questionnaires. The primary outcome of the QoL analysis was a minimum clinically important difference defined as a 0.5 standard deviation change from baseline for each respective QoL parameter. Treatment effects were evaluated with the use of logistic mixed effects regression models.  Results:   A total of 286, 299, and 218 patients had baseline EPIC, IPSS, or EQ5D data available and were included in the analysis. Overall, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment arms in terms of EPIC, IPSS, or EQ5D scores over time, although there was a trend toward lower EPIC urinary incontinence scores in the HIMRT arm. More patients in the HIMRT arm had a lower EPIC urinary incontinence score relative to baseline versus patients in the CIMRT arm with long-term follow-up. On multivariable analysis, there was no association between radiation fractionation scheme and any QoL parameter. When other clinical factors were examined, lymph node radiation was associated with worse EPIC hormonal scores versus patients receiving no lymph node radiation. In general, QoL outcomes were generally stable over time, with the exception of EPIC hormonal and EQ5D scores.  Conclusions:   In this randomized prospective study, there were stable QoL changes in patients receiving HIMRT or CIMRT.

Whilst a number of metrics in the literature have been used to quantify intrafraction prostate motion, it has not been established whether these metrics reflect the effect of motion on the RT dose delivered to the patients. In this study, prostate motion during volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment of 18 patients and a total of 294 fractions was quantified through novel metrics as well as those available in the literature. The impact of the motion on VMAT dosimetry was evaluated using these metrics and dose reconstructions based on a previously validated and published method. The dosimetric impact of the motion on planning target volume (PTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) coverage and organs at risk (OARs) was correlated with the motion metrics, using the coefficient of determination (R 2 ), to evaluate their utility. Action level threshold for the prostate motion metric that best described the dosimetric impact on the PTV D95% was investigated through iterative regression analysis. The average (range) of the mean motion for the patient cohort was 1.5 mm (0.3-9.9 mm). A number of motion metrics were found to be strongly correlated with PTV D95%, the range of R 2 was 0.43-0.81. For all the motion measures, correlations with CTV D99% (range of R 2 was 0.12-0.62), rectum V65% (range of R 2 was 0.33-0.58) and bladder V65% (range of R 2 was 0.51-0.69) were not as strong as for PTV D95%. The mean of the highest 50% of motion metric was one of the best indicator of dosimetric impact on PTV D95%. Action level threshold value for this metric was found to be 3.0 mm. For an individual fraction, when the metric value was greater than 3.0 mm then the PTV D95% was reduced on average by 6.2%. This study demonstrated that several motion metrics are well correlated with the dosimetric impact (PTV D95%) of individual fraction prostate motion on VMAT delivery and could be used for treatment course adaptation.""","""['Prabhjot Juneja', 'Emma Colvill', 'Andrew Kneebone', 'Thomas Eade', 'Jin A Ng', 'David I Thwaites', 'Paul Keall', 'Ramandeep Kaur', 'Per Poulsen', 'Jeremy T Booth']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Australas Phys Eng Sci Med""","""['DMLC tracking and gating can improve dose coverage for prostate VMAT.', 'The dosimetric error due to uncorrected tumor rotation during real-time adaptive prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy.', 'Analyzing the impact of intrafraction motion: correlation of different dose metrics with changes in target D95%.', 'Correlation between dosimetric effect and intrafraction motion during prostate treatments delivered with helical tomotherapy.', 'Kilovoltage intrafraction motion monitoring and target dose reconstruction for stereotactic volumetric modulated arc therapy of tumors in the liver.', 'Dynamic intrafractional position monitoring with implanted fiducial markers for enhanced accuracy in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Intrafraction Prostate Motion and Interfraction Anatomical Changes in Dose-Escalated Linac-Based SBRT.', 'Clinical validation of the Varian Truebeam intra-fraction motion review (IMR) system for prostate treatment guidance.', 'Shorter treatment times reduce the impact of intra-fractional motion : A\xa0real-time 4DUS study comparing VMAT vs. step-and-shoot IMRT for prostate cancer.']"""

One of the mechanisms includes the upregulation of RT-induced antioxidant enzymes. Thus, combination therapy with RT and certain pharmaceutical drugs targeting antioxidant enzymes may be ideal for increasing the efficacy of RT with minimum side effects. Naftopidil is a subtype-selective α1D-adrenoceptor antagonist used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In our drug repositioning study, naftopidil showed not only unique growth-inhibitory effects but also AKT phosphorylation-inhibitory effects in PC-3 human PCa cells. Here, we examined the efficacy of additive naftopidil treatment in combination with RT in PC-3 cells.  Methods:   The effects of combination therapy with RT plus naftopidil were analyzed using an animal model of PC-3 xenografts in BALB/c nude mice. The expression of the antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) was evaluated by western blotting.  Results:   Combination therapy with RT plus naftopidil induced a more efficacious delay in PC-3 xenograft tumor growth as compared with monotherapy with naftopidil or RT. In PC-3 tumors, combination therapy with RT plus naftopidil suppressed the upregulation of RT-induced MnSOD expression.

Moreover, chemical and biological experiments have evidenced that curcumin is a biologically active iron chelator and induces cytotoxicity through iron chelation. We thus hypothesized that curcumin may induce apoptosis and autophagy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells through its iron-chelating properties.  Materials and methods:   CRPC cells were loaded with curcumin alone or in combination with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC). Cytotoxicity was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and caspase activity. Autophagy status was analyzed by the detection of autophagosomes and light chain 3-II (LC3-II) using transmission electron microscopy and Western blot. Iron-binding activity of curcumin was assessed by spectrophotometry and MTT assay. The expression levels of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) were examined by Western blot.  Results:   Curcumin induced apoptosis and autophagy in CRPC cells. Combining curcumin with autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine [3-MA]) synergized the apoptotic effect of curcumin. Moreover, curcumin bound to FAC at a ratio of ~1:1, as assessed by spectrophotometry and MTT assay. Apoptosis and autophagy induced by curcumin were counteracted by equal amounts of FAC. At apoptosis- and autophagy-inducing concentrations, curcumin enhanced the expression levels of TfR1 and IRP1, indicative of iron deprivation induced by curcumin.  Conclusion:   Together, our results indicate that curcumin induces apoptosis and protective autophagy in CRPC cells, which are at least partially dependent on its iron-chelating properties.""","""['Chunguang Yang', 'Xueyou Ma', 'Zhihua Wang', 'Xing Zeng', 'Zhiquan Hu', 'Zhangqun Ye', 'Guanxin Shen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Drug Des Devel Ther""","""['Curcumin induces apoptotic cell death and protective autophagy by inhibiting AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in human ovarian cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of Autophagy Improves the Efficacy of Abiraterone for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Combination simvastatin and metformin induces G1-phase cell cycle arrest and Ripk1- and Ripk3-dependent necrosis in C4-2B osseous metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'δ-Tocotrienol induces apoptosis, involving endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy, and paraptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Curcumin-mediated regulation of Notch1/hairy and enhancer of split-1/survivin: molecular targeting in cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Pharmacological Mechanisms and Clinical Applications of Curcumin: Update.', 'The crosslinks between ferroptosis and autophagy in asthma.', 'Curcumin: a natural organic component that plays a multi-faceted role in ovarian cancer.', 'Effects of Curcumin and Lactoferrin to Inhibit the Growth and Migration of Prostatic Cancer Cells.', 'Curcumin Modulates Oxidative Stress, Fibrosis, and Apoptosis in Drug-Resistant Cancer Cell Lines.']"""

This addition involves image registration, which inherently has inter- and intraobserver variabilities. We sought to quantify the inter- and intraobserver variabilities in geometry and dosimetry for contouring and image registration and analyze the results for our dynamic 125I brachytherapy procedure.  Methods and materials:   Five observers contoured 11 transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) data sets three times and 11 CT data sets one time. The observers registered 11 TRUS and MRI data sets to cone beam CT (CBCT) using fiducial gold markers. Geometrical and dosimetrical inter- and intraobserver variabilities were assessed. For the contouring study, structures were subdivided into three parts along the craniocaudal axis.  Results:   We analyzed 165 observations. Interobserver geometrical variability for prostate was 1.1 mm, resulting in a dosimetric variability of 1.6% for V100 and 9.3% for D90. The geometric intraobserver variability was 0.6 mm with a V100 of 0.7% and D90 of 1.1%. TRUS-CBCT registration showed an interobserver variability in V100 of 2.0% and D90 of 3.1%. Intraobserver variabilities were 0.9% and 1.6%, respectively. For MRI-CBCT registration, V100 and D90 were 1.3% and 2.1%. Intraobserver variabilities were 0.7% and 1.1% for the same.

The establishment of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) only RTP workflow requires the generation of a synthetic CT (sCT) for dose calculation. This study evaluates the feasibility of using a multi-atlas sCT synthesis approach (sCTa) for head and neck and prostate patients.  Material and methods:   The multi-atlas method was based on pairs of non-rigidly aligned MR and CT images. The sCTa was obtained by registering the MRI atlases to the patient's MRI and by fusing the mapped atlases according to morphological similarity to the patient. For comparison, a bulk density assignment approach (sCTbda) was also evaluated. The sCTbda was obtained by assigning density values to MRI tissue classes (air, bone and soft-tissue). After evaluating the synthesis accuracy of the sCTs (mean absolute error), sCT-based delineations were geometrically compared to the CT-based delineations. Clinical plans were re-calculated on both sCTs and a dose-volume histogram and a gamma analysis was performed using the CT dose as ground truth.  Results:   Results showed that both sCTs were suitable to perform clinical dose calculations with mean dose differences less than 1% for both the planning target volume and the organs at risk. However, only the sCTa provided an accurate and automatic delineation of bone.

Methods:   The PROMETHEUS study commenced in 2014 and provides a prostate SBRT boost dose with a RDD in place. Twelve patients received two boost fractions of 9.5-10 Gy each delivered to the prostate with a dual arc volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique. Two MOSkins in a face-to-face arrangement (dual MOSkin) were used to decrease angular dependence. A dual MOSkin was attached to the anterior surface of the Rectafix and read out at 1 Hz during each treatment. The planned dose at each measurement point was exported from the planning system and compared with the measured dose. The root mean square error normalised to the total planned dose was calculated for each measurement point and treatment arc for the entire course of treatment.  Results:   The average difference between the measured and planned doses over the whole course of treatment for all arcs measured was 9.7% with a standard deviation of 3.6%. The cumulative MOSkin reading was lower than the total planned dose for 64% of the arcs measured. The average difference between the final measured and final planned doses for all arcs measured was 3.4% of the final planned dose, with a standard deviation of 10.3%.

The aim of this study was to investigate clinical significance, biological functions and underlying mechanisms of miR-30d deregulation in PCa.  Methods:   Involvement of miR-30d deregulation in malignant phenotypes of PCa was demonstrated by clinical sample evaluation, and in vitro and in vivo experiments. The mechanisms underlying its regulatory effect on tumor angiogenesis were determined.  Results:   miR-30d over-expression was observed in both PCa cells and clinical specimens. High-miR-30d was distinctly associated with high pre-operative PSA and Gleason score, advanced clinical and pathological stages, positive metastasis and biochemical recurrence (BCR), and reduced overall survival of PCa patients. Through gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we found that miR-30d promoted PCa cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and capillary tube formation of endothelial cells, as well as in vivo tumor growth and angiogenesis in a mouse model. Simulation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1), acting as a direct target of miR-30d, antagonized the effects induced by miR-30d up-regulation in PCa cells. Notably, miR-30d/MYPT1 combination was identified as an independent factor to predict BCR of PCa patients. Furthermore, miR-30d exerted its pro-angiogenesis function, at least in part, by inhibiting MYPT1, which in turn, increased phosphorylation levels of c-JUN and activated VEGFA-induced signaling cascade in endothelial cells.

T cells represent a crucial component of the adaptive immune system and are thought to mediate anti-tumoral immunity. Antigen-specific recognition by T cells is via the T cell receptor (TCR) which is unique for each T cell. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of the TCRs can be used as a platform to profile the T cell repertoire. Though there are a number of software tools available for processing repertoire data by mapping antigen receptor segments to sequencing reads and assembling the clonotypes, most of them are not designed to track and examine the dynamic nature of the TCR repertoire across multiple time points or between different biologic compartments (e.g., blood and tissue samples) in a clinical context.  Results:   We integrated different diversity measures to assess the T cell repertoire diversity and examined the robustness of the diversity indices. Among those tested, Clonality was identified for its robustness as a key metric for study design and the first choice to measure TCR repertoire diversity. To evaluate the dynamic nature of T cell clonotypes across time, we utilized several binary similarity measures (such as Baroni-Urbani and Buser overlap index), relative clonality and Morisita's overlap index, as well as the intraclass correlation coefficient, and performed fold change analysis, which was further extended to investigate the transition of clonotypes among different biological compartments. Furthermore, the application of differential testing enabled the detection of clonotypes which were significantly changed across time. By applying the proposed ""3D"" analysis pipeline to the real example of prostate cancer subjects who received sipuleucel-T, an FDA-approved immunotherapy, we were able to detect changes in TCR sequence frequency and diversity thus demonstrating that sipuleucel-T treatment affected TCR repertoire in blood and in prostate tissue. We also found that the increase in common TCR sequences between tissue and blood after sipuleucel-T treatment supported the hypothesis that treatment-induced T cell migrated into the prostate tissue. In addition, a second example of prostate cancer subjects treated with Ipilimumab and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was presented in the supplementary documents to further illustrate assessing the treatment-associated change in a clinical context by the proposed workflow.  Conclusions:   Our paper provides guidance to study the diversity and dynamics of NGS-based TCR repertoire profiling in a clinical context to ensure consistency and reproducibility of post-analysis. This analysis pipeline will provide an initial workflow for TCR sequencing data with serial time points and for comparing T cells in multiple compartments for a clinical study.""","""['Li Zhang', 'Jason Cham', 'Alan Paciorek', 'James Trager', 'Nadeem Sheikh', 'Lawrence Fong']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Clonotypic Diversification of Intratumoral T Cells Following Sipuleucel-T Treatment in Prostate Cancer Subjects.', 'Clinical T Cell Receptor Repertoire Deep Sequencing and Analysis: An Application to Monitor Immune Reconstitution Following Cord Blood Transplantation.', 'ImmunoDataAnalyzer: a bioinformatics pipeline for processing barcoded and UMI tagged immunological NGS data.', 'T-cell receptor repertoire analysis for the diagnosis and treatment of solid tumor: A methodology and clinical applications.', 'Sipuleucel-T: APC 8015, APC-8015, prostate cancer vaccine--Dendreon.', ""Modulation of myeloid and T cells in vivo by Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."", 'Single cell transcriptomics and TCR reconstruction reveal CD4 T cell response to MHC-II-restricted APOB epitope in human cardiovascular disease.', 'Altered T-Cell Receptor β-Chain and Lactate Dehydrogenase Are Associated With the Immune Pathogenesis of Biliary Atresia.', 'Deep Sequencing of T-Cell Receptors for Monitoring Peripheral CD8+ T Cells in Chinese Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated With the Anti-PD-L1 Antibody.', 'Restricted TcR β chain CDR3 clonotype is associated with resolved acute hepatitis B subjects.']"""

The μTAS system can utilize affinity-based separation involving noncovalent interaction between the immunocomplex of S2,3PSA and Maackia amurensis lectin to simultaneously determine concentrations of free PSA and S2,3PSA. To validate quantitative performance, both recombinant S2,3PSA and benign-associated α2,6-linked sialyl N-glycan-carrying PSA (S2,6PSA) purified from culture supernatant of PSA cDNA transiently-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were used as standard protein.

MEK4 is overexpressed and induces metastasis in advanced prostate cancer lesions. However, the value of MEK4 as an oncology target has not been pharmacologically validated because selective chemical probes targeting MEK4 have not been developed. Despite a high level of sequence homology in the ATP-binding site, most reported MEK inhibitors are selective for MEK1/2 and display reduced potency toward other MEKs. Here, we present the first functional and binding selectivity-profiling platform of the MEK family. We applied the platform to profile a set of known kinase inhibitors and used the results to develop an in silico approach for small molecule docking against MEK proteins. The docking studies identified molecular features of the ligands and corresponding amino acids in MEK proteins responsible for high affinity binding versus those driving selectivity. WaterLOGSY and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy techniques were utilized to understand the binding modes of active compounds. Further minor synthetic manipulations provide a proof of concept by showing how information gained through this platform can be utilized to perturb selectivity across the MEK family. This inhibitor-based approach pinpoints key features governing MEK family selectivity and clarifies empirical selectivity profiles for a set of kinase inhibitors. Going forward, the platform provides a rationale for facilitating the development of MEK-selective inhibitors, particularly MEK4 selective inhibitors, and repurposing of kinase inhibitors for probing the structural selectivity of isoforms.""","""['Kristine K Deibler', 'Rama K Mishra', 'Matthew R Clutter', 'Aleksandar Antanasijevic', 'Raymond Bergan', 'Michael Caffrey', 'Karl A Scheidt']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""ACS Chem Biol""","""['Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 3-Arylindazoles as Selective MEK4 Inhibitors.', 'Modeling MEK4 Kinase Inhibitors through Perturbed Electrostatic Potential Charges.', 'Selective targeting of MAPK family kinases JNK over p38 by rationally designed peptides as potential therapeutics for neurological disorders and epilepsy.', 'MEK1/2 inhibitors in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies.', 'TAK1 selective inhibition: state of the art and future opportunities.', 'Rational Design of Highly Potent and Selective Covalent MAP2K7 Inhibitors.', 'MKK4 Inhibitors-Recent Development Status and Therapeutic Potential.', 'Pazopanib alleviates neuroinflammation and protects dopaminergic neurons in LPS-stimulated mouse model by inhibiting MEK4-JNK-AP-1 pathway.', 'Rational Design, Optimization, and Biological Evaluation of Novel MEK4 Inhibitors against Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.', 'Inhibition of the MAP2K7-JNK pathway with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol induces apoptosis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.']"""

Little is known about men with localized prostate cancer who seek second opinions, the reasons why, and the association with treatment and quality of care.  Methods:   We surveyed men who were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in the greater Philadelphia area from 2012 to 2014. Men were asked if they obtained a second opinion from a urologist, and the reasons why. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the relationship between second opinions and definitive prostate cancer treatment and perceived quality of care.  Results:   A total of 2386 men responded to the survey (adjusted response rate, 51.1%). After applying exclusion criteria, the final analytic cohort included 2365 respondents. Of these, 40% obtained second opinions, most commonly because they wanted more information about their cancer (50.8%) and wanted to be seen by the best doctor (46.3%). Overall, obtaining second opinions was not associated with definitive treatment or perceived quality of cancer care. Men who sought second opinions because they were dissatisfied with their initial urologist were less likely to receive definitive treatment (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.73), and men who wanted more information about treatment were less likely to report excellent quality of cancer care (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.99) compared with men who did not receive a second opinion.  Conclusions:   Although a large proportion of men with localized prostate cancer obtained a second opinion, the reasons for doing so were not associated with treatment choice or perceived quality of cancer care.

Measurements:   Cancer history, falls, and frailty status (robust, prefrail, frail) using traditionally defined and obese phenotypes.  Results:   Current (37%) or past (34%) ADT users were more than twice as likely to have fallen in the previous year as never users (15%) (P = .002).

We performed a phase 1 study investigating the safety and feasibility of the combined treatment with Re-HEDP and cabazitaxel in mCRPC patients.  Methods:   Patients with mCRPC and documented disease progression on or after docetaxel were eligible for inclusion.

Materials and methods:   This is a retrospective study using a single institutional database. We included patients with localized, intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated radiation therapy (RT) with 3D conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (74-80 Gy in daily fraction of 1.8 Gy-2.0 Gy, or 70.2 Gy in daily fraction of 2.7 Gy) from 1992 to 2013. To further risk stratify the patients, PSA 10 ng/mL-20 ng/mL, Gleason 3+4, and T2b-T2c were assigned risk score (RS) of 1, while Gleason 4+3 was assigned RS of 2. Patients with prior treatment for prostate cancer, those on long term ADT (>= 23 months), or those with follow up < 1 year were excluded. We defined initial ADT as initiation within 9 months prior to the start of RT, during RT, or within 2 months after the completion of RT. Outcomes for patients who received initial ADT were compared to men treated with RT alone. Covariates included number of intermediate risk factors, age, and baseline comorbidities. Kaplan Meier estimates were compared using log rank tests. Competing risk regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to estimate hazard ratios adjusted for covariates.  Results:   Of 1,134 patients included in this study, 155 received initial ADT with median duration of 4.0 months (m) (range 0.5 m-22.0 m). The median follow up was 56.4 m (range 12.3 m-200.7 m). Patients on ADT had higher RS compared to those with radiation alone (RS 1: 48% versus 58%; RS 2: 35% versus 32%; RS 3: 14% versus 9%; RS 4: 3% versus 1%; p=0.01). When patients with ADT were compared to those treated with radiation alone, there were no significant differences in freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) (84.0% versus 87.3%, p = 0.83), freedom from distant metastasis (FFDM) (94.4% versus 96.9%, p = 0.41), or overall survival (OS) (92.3% versus 90.7%, (p = 0.48) at 5 years. Among patients with RS >= 2, there were still no significant differences in FFBF, FFDM, or OS when patients treated with ADT were compared to those treated with radiation alone. In multivariable analyses adjusting for RS and age, the adjusted hazard ratio for ADT use was sHR = 0.89 (95% CI = 0.64-1.66, p = 0.64) for BCF; sHR = 1.13 (95% CI = 0.48-2.65, p = 0.77) for DM. For overall mortality, adjusted HR = 1.23 (95% CI = 0.76-2.01, p = 0.40) where comorbidities (including diabetes, cardiac disease, and hypertension) were also included as covariates.

The aims of this study were to implement Calypso with Dynamic Edge™ gating and to assess both the motion seen, and interventions required.  Methods:   An implementation group was formed which assessed changes needed to standard workflows. Three patients had Calypso beacons inserted into their prostate. All patients were treated using volumetric modulated arc therapy to a dose of 80 Gy in 40 fractions. Standard inter-fraction motion correction using either kilovoltage (kV) orthogonal paired imaging or cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) image-guided radiotherapy techniques, were used along with the Calypso system to compare accuracy. A gating threshold of >0.5 cm was used during treatment. Workflow variations along with inter- and intra-fraction motion and interventions required were assessed.  Results:   A total of 116 fractions were treated using Calypso with Dynamic Edge™ gating. There was a strong concordance between aligning beacons using kV orthogonal imaging or CBCT and Calypso (mean variation ≤0.06 cm). The mean intra-fraction motion detected was ≤0.2 cm in all directions with the largest motion recorded being 2.2 cm in the left direction while the treatment beam was off. Prostate rotation was largest in the pitch direction and 28 fractions exceeded the 10° tolerance. A total of 78 couch shift corrections of ≥0.3 cm were required, usually following standard imaging, and before treatment starting. Three gating events due to intra-fraction motion occurred during treatment.  Conclusions:   Intra-fraction motion monitoring with Calypso was successfully implemented. Greatest movement was seen between time of standard imaging and treatment starting with more than half the treatments requiring a ≥0.3 cm adjustment.

Paired t-test to evaluate the change of BMD from baseline to 12 month, and two sample t-test to examine the difference of BMD changes were used between two groups. BMD significantly decreased in both the CAB and GnRH groups, with no group wise differences. The proportion of osteopenia or osteoporosis was slightly increased after the 12-month post-ADT. Ten-year probability of hip fracture and major osteoporotic fracture was approximately 3% and 5%, respectively. In conclusion, a significant decrease of BMD by 12-month ADT was observed without any differences between the two groups, whereas ADT-related BMD loss did not induce detrimental effects on bone health in terms of increased bone fracture risk.

Methods and materials:   ASCENDE-RT enrolled 398 men, with a median age of 68 years; 69% (n=276) had high-risk disease. After stratification by risk group, the subjects were randomized to a standard arm with 12 months of androgen deprivation therapy, pelvic irradiation to 46 Gy, followed by a dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy (DE-EBRT) boost to 78 Gy, or an experimental arm that substituted a low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (LDR-PB) boost. Of the 398 trial subjects, 200 were assigned to DE-EBRT boost and 198 to LDR-PB boost. The median follow-up was 6.5 years.  Results:   In an intent-to-treat analysis, men randomized to DE-EBRT were twice as likely to experience biochemical failure (multivariable analysis [MVA] hazard ratio [HR] 2.04; P=.004). The 5-, 7-, and 9-year Kaplan-Meier b-PFS estimates were 89%, 86%, and 83% for the LDR-PB boost versus 84%, 75%, and 62% for the DE-EBRT boost (log-rank P<.001). The LDR-PB boost benefited both intermediate- and high-risk patients. Because the b-PFS curves for the treatment arms diverge sharply after 4 years, the relative advantage of the LDR-PB should increase with longer follow-up. On MVA, the only variables correlated with reduced overall survival were age (MVA HR 1.06/y; P=.004) and biochemical failure (MVA HR 6.30; P<.001). Although biochemical failure was associated with increased mortality and randomization to DE-EBRT doubled the rate of biochemical failure, no significant overall survival difference was observed between the treatment arms (MVA HR 1.13; P=.62).

Our results showed that reduced INPP4B staining was significantly correlated with the tumour-node-metastasis stage. Moreover, transfection with Flag-INPP4B plasmid suppressed the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through inactivating the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, at the same time decreased vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and suppressed human umbilical vein endothelial cells proliferation and tube formation. Futhermore, it was also found that INPP4B could inhibit tumour growth and angiogenesis in vivo.

To analyze the impact of radical prostatectomy (RPE) on erectile function and lower urinary tract function in comparison to age-matched healthy men. Materials and Methods. Patients who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy completed questionnaires containing the IIEF-5, the Bristol female LUTS questionnaire, and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Results. Patients after RPE were included (n = 363). Age-matched healthy men (n = 363) were included. The mean IIEF-5 of patients aged 61-70 yrs after RPE was 10.4 ± 6.6 versus 18.8 ± 5.3 in the control cohort; the respective values for men aged 71-80 yrs after RPE were 7.2 ± 6.5 versus 13.6 ± 7.7 in the control cohort. Urinary incontinence after RPE was reported in 41.9% (61-70 years) and 37.7% (71-80) versus 7.5% and 15.1% in the control cohort. The mean IPSS of patients after RPE aged 61-70 yrs was 5.0 ± 4.4 versus 5.5 ± 4.9 in the control cohort; the respective values for men aged 71-80 yrs were 6.0 ± 4.9 versus 7.5 ± 5.7 in the healthy cohort. Conclusions. The negative effect of radical prostatectomy on erectile and urinary incontinence remains substantial. The physiologically declining erectile and lower urinary tract function with ageing reduces the difference between healthy men and those after surgery.

The current study involves a novel targeting approach using specifically designed nanoparticles, including encapsulation of the anti-cancer drug valrubicin into superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) containing reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL) nanoparticles. Specifically, rHDL-SPION-valrubicin hybrid nanoparticles were assembled and characterized with respect to their physical and chemical properties, drug entrapment efficiency and receptor-mediated release of the drug valrubicin from the nanoparticles to prostate cancer (PC-3) cells. Prussian blue staining was used to assess nanoparticle movement in a magnetic field. Measurements of cytotoxicity toward PC-3 cells showed that rHDL-SPION-valrubicin nanoparticles were up to 4.6 and 31 times more effective at the respective valrubicin concentrations of 42.4 µg/mL and 85 µg/mL than the drug valrubicin alone.

We computed the difference of analyte concentrations across paired vials (T1 vs. T2, T2 vs. T3) and tested whether the difference deviated from zero using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We also calculated Spearman rank correlation and weighted kappa statistics for T1 vs. T2 and T2 vs. T3 comparisons to assess agreement in rank ordering of subjects.  Results:   Measurements between paired T1 and T2 samples were largely similar, with the difference not statistically deviating from zero for 36 of the 45 markers.

In this study we identify clinical and pathological features of 154 patients with prostate cancer younger than 55 years old and to assist intreatment decisions. Methods: The medical records of 154 prostate cancer patients younger than 55 years old in Peking University First Hospital from Feb 1953 to Jun 2016 were reviewed, retrospectively. Data was collected including symptoms, digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, tumor stage, treatment strategies. Results: The mean age was 50.9±4.5, and 25.3% patients were between 40-50 years. Fifty-six (36.4%) patients initially presented with lower urinary tract symptoms. A solid mass could be found by digital rectal examination in 48(31.2%) patients. All patients were diagnosed by pathology of biopsy or surgery. The median Gleason score was 8. Gleason 2-6, 3+ 4, 4+ 3, 8, 9-10 were 15 cases(9.7%), 28 cases(18.2%), 21 cases(13.6%), 15 cases(9.7%), 51 cases(33.1%), respectively. Based on 2009 AJCC TNM Classification criteria the distribution of tumor stage was T1, T2, T3, and T4 in 2(1.3%), 54 (35.1%), 60 (39.0%), and 37 (24.0%) patients. Forty patients (25.9%) were found with bone metastasis and four (2.5%) suffered from visceral metastasis. Fifty-three(34.4%)underwent hormonal therapy and 79(51.3%) underwent radical prostatectomy. Conclusion: Younger prostate caner patients usually presented with LUTS symptoms and were featured for higher tumor stage and aggressiveness.

However, the influence of ATO on reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels before and after irradiation has not been fully illustrated. In the present study, radiosensitivity was evaluated by a clonogenic assay and a cell survival curve and cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. ROS were detected by a laser scanning confocal microscope and flow cytometry with a DCFH-DA probe. NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) proteins were detected by immunoblotting, and total SOD activity was measured using an SOD kit. We also conducted transient transfection of NOX2 and NOX4 genes to increase intracellular ROS generation and applied SOD mimetic tempol to enhance ROS elimination ability. Our results demonstrated that, with ATO-alone treatment, the survival fractions of irradiated PC-3 cells were significantly decreased. Meanwhile, the apoptosis rate of the irradiated cells increased significantly (P<0.05). The ROS levels of the study group decreased obviously before irradiation (P<0.01), however, the radiation-induced ROS of the study group was at a high level even when irradiation had been terminated for 2 h (P<0.01). Moreover, NOX2 and NOX4 levels and total SOD activity decreased (P<0.01), while the levels of SOD1 were stably maintained (P>0.05). On the other hand, the decreased survival fractions and high radiation-induced ROS levels were abrogated by increasing the level of NOXs by gene transfection or by enhancing the ability of SOD utilizing the addition of tempol. In conclusion, ATO enhanced the cell killing effect of irradiation by reducing endogenous ROS levels and prolonging the lifespan of radiation‑induced ROS via a decrease in the level of NOXs and SOD activity.""","""['Hao Yu', 'Shao-Qian Sun', 'Xiao-Bin Gu', 'Wen Wang', 'Xian-Shu Gao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Protective effects of tetrahydropalmatine against gamma-radiation induced damage to human endothelial cells.', 'Metformin decreases growth of pancreatic cancer cells by decreasing reactive oxygen species: Role of NOX4.', 'HMGN5 knockdown sensitizes prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation.', 'Reactive oxygen species as mediator of tumor radiosensitivity.', 'Utilizing Superoxide Dismutase Mimetics to Enhance Radiation Therapy Response While Protecting Normal Tissues.', 'Tumor-Specific Induction of the Intrinsic Apoptotic Pathway-A New Therapeutic Option for Advanced Prostate Cancer?']"""

Identification of metastasis-related proteins may facilitate the development of novel therapies for the treatment of metastatic disease. In the present study, we aimed to identify prostate cancer metastasis-associated membrane proteins. We developed a phage-displayed 7-mer peptide library to screen the target peptides that were specifically bound to PC-3M cells with subtractive panning from normal prostate cells and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. A novel short peptide (B04) was found to have high affinity to highly metastatic PC-3M cells. ATP synthase β subunit (ATP5B) was then identified as a binding partner of B04 on the PC-3M cell surface. ATP5B was expressed on the PC-3M cell membrane and on highly malignant human prostate cancer specimens, as shown using multiple methodologies. Furthermore, ATP5B-positive gold particles were detected on the cellular and mitochondrial membranes by immunoelectromicroscopy. These results implied the possibility that ATP5B may translocate from the inner mitochondrial membrane to the outer surface of PC-3M cells. Additional analysis showed that incubation of B04 with PC-3M cells reduced the detection of ATP5B by western blotting and flow cytometry and significantly inhibited the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of PC-3M cells. In conclusion, ATP5B, as a binding partner of a metastasis-related short peptide (B04) on prostate cancer cells, is involved in promoting prostate cancer metastasis.

However, the exact mechanisms and/or markers associated with chemosensitivity or resistance to docetaxel remain unclear. We previously showed that the expression of prostate apoptosis response 4 (PAR4) inhibits the growth of MCF7 breast cancer cells and increases their sensitivity to docetaxel. Using cDNA microarray analysis, we evaluated transcriptome changes in MCF7 cells expressing increased levels of PAR4 and control cells before and after docetaxel treatment. Some of the top gene networks generated from the differentially expressed genes were related to the wingless‑type MMTV integration 1 (WNT) canonical (WNT/β-catenin) and non‑canonical (β‑catenin‑independent) pathways. The Human WNT signaling pathway RT2 profiler™ PCR array was used to validate the effects of PAR4 on the expression pattern of genes involved in the WNT pathway. CACNAD2A3, GDF5 and IL6 were upregulated and NANOG was downregulated in the MCF7 breast cancer cells expressing increased levels of PAR4 after treatment with docetaxel, likely indicating inactivation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Upregulation of FGF7, LEF1 and TWIST1 indicated activation of the WNT/β‑catenin pathway. Although preliminary, our findings could be of particular interest for understanding the action of PAR4 in chemosensitivity, particularly to increase the specificity and effectiveness of drug treatment and overcome resistance to chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to better understand the biological roles of PAR4 in the regulation of WNT pathways in breast cancer cells in response to docetaxel and other chemotherapeutic agents.""","""['Simone Aparecida de Bessa Garcia', 'Ana Carolina Pavanelli', 'Natália Cruz E Melo', 'Maria Aparecida Nagai']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['The Wnt non-canonical signaling modulates cabazitaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer cells.', 'Breast cancer cells respond differently to docetaxel depending on their phenotype and on survivin upregulation.', 'Acquisition of docetaxel resistance in breast cancer cells reveals upregulation of ABCB1 expression as a key mediator of resistance accompanied by discrete upregulation of other specific genes and pathways.', 'Wnt signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Salinomycin: A new paradigm in cancer therapy.', 'Abnormal Long Non-Coding RNAs Expression Patterns Have the Potential Ability for Predicting Survival and Treatment Response in Breast Cancer.', 'Targeting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in cancer.', 'miR-601 inhibits proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer stem cells by targeting KRT5 to inactivate the Wnt signaling pathway.', 'Identification and characterization of biomarkers and their functions for docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Primary hyperparathyroidism in prostate cancer: guilty or not guilty?']"""

The study showed that rs1899663 T allele was associated with BPH risk. Comparison between prostate cancer and BPH groups showed that rs1899663 is associated with cancer risk in co-dominant, dominant and recessive inheritance models. The rs12826786 T allele was significantly more presented in both BPH and prostate cancer groups compared with healthy subjects. This SNP was associated with both BPH and prostate cancer risk in co-dominant and recessive models. However, rs4759314 showed no significant difference in allele or genotype frequencies between three mentioned groups.

Results:   Our results indicated that in PC3 cancer cells, MOE resulted in a significant downregulation of VEGF-A (0.0004 fold), Bcl-2 (0.001 fold), Her2 (0.02 fold), and hTERT (0.023 fold) compared to the untreated control. In addition, VEGF-A and hTERT mRNA were significantly downregulated in MCF-7 and A549 cancer cells, as well. Notably, high anti-angiogenic activity was closely associated with a high anti-telomerase activity of MOE in studying cancer cells. The decrease in VEGF-A expression was significantly superior than that of hTERT downregulation, as PC3 cancer cells with the highest hTERT down regulation (0.023) presented the highest anti VEGF activity (0.0004 fold), whereas MCF-7 cells with the lowest hTERT inhibition (0.213) showed the lowest VEGF inhibition(0.0435) among the three studied cancer cells. We noticed that the modulation of VEGF-A and hTERT gene expression can be considered as a common target, accounting for the therapeutic potential of MOE on human breast, lung and prostate cancer cells.  Conclusion:   Altogether, it is suggested that the potent antiproliferative activity of the hydroalcoholic extract of Melissa officinalis is somehow explainable by its high potency to inhibit expression of the prominent oncogenes Bcl2, Her2, VEGF-A and hTERT in prostate cancer. In tumors with functional p53, including MCF-7 and A549 cancer cells, the role of p53, Bcl2 and Her2 is less significant. It appears that MOE exerts its antiproliferative effects in these cancer cells partly via concurrent downregulation of VEGF-A and hTERT. Additional studies are needed to clarify the role of other active molecules in cancer cells harboring functional p53.""","""['Rana Jahanban-Esfahlan', 'Khaled Seidi', 'Amir Monfaredan', 'Vahid Shafie-Irannejad', 'Mehran Mesgari Abbasi', 'Ansar Karimian', 'Bahman Yousefi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Gene""","""['The involvement of HER2 and p53 status in the regulation of telomerase in irradiated breast cancer cells.', 'Anti Proliferative Properties of Melissa officinalis in Different Human Cancer Cells.', 'Melissa officinalis L. ethanolic extract inhibits the growth of a lung cancer cell line by interfering with the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis.', 'Melissa officinalis: Composition, Pharmacological Effects and Derived Release Systems-A Review.', 'Antiviral Potential of Melissa officinalis L.: A Literature Review.', 'Application Value Analysis of Seven-Autoantibody Panel in the Lung Cancer Screening in Yunnan.', 'An In Vitro Evaluation of the Molecular Mechanisms of Action of Medical Plants from the Lamiaceae Family as Effective Sources of Active Compounds against Human Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Lemon Balm Extracts Prevent Breast Cancer Progression In Vitro and In Ovo on Chorioallantoic Membrane Assay.', 'Phytochemicals in Prostate Cancer: From Bioactive Molecules to Upcoming Therapeutic Agents.', 'Elevated Platelet Count Appears to Be Causally Associated with Increased Risk of Lung Cancer: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis.']"""

The aim was to record the expression and localization of caveolin-1 in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and prostatic carcinoma (PCa). Microvessel density was evaluated with CD34 immunostain. Correlations with known prognostic factors of PCa were recorded. Immunohistochemical expression of caveolin-1 and the MVD was evaluated in 65 cases; BPH (25), HGPIN (20) and PCa (20). Stromal caveolin-1expression was significantly higher in BPH than HGPIN and PCca. There was significant inverse relation between stromal caveolin-1 expression and extension to lymph node and seminal vesicle in carcinoma cases. Epithelial caveolin-1 was significantly higher in carcinomas than in BPH and HGPIN. Epithelial expression in carcinoma was significantly associated with preoperative PSA, Gleason score and lymph node extension. MVD was significantly higher in PCa than in BPH and HGPIN.

It is unknown whether these mutations associate with differential response to androgen receptor (AR)-directed therapy.  Objective:   To determine the clinical response of mCRPC patients with germline DNA repair defects to AR-directed therapies and to establish whether biallelic DNA repair gene loss is detectable in matched circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).  Design, setting, and participants:   We recruited 319 mCRPC patients and performed targeted germline sequencing of 22 DNA repair genes. In patients with deleterious germline mutations, plasma cell-free DNA was also sequenced.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Prostate-specific antigen response and progression were assessed in relation to initial androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and subsequent therapy for mCRPC using Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results and limitations:   Of the 319 patients, 24 (7.5%) had deleterious germline mutations, with BRCA2 (n=16) being the most frequent. Patients (n=22) with mutations in genes linked to homologous recombination were heterogeneous at initial presentation but, after starting ADT, progressed to mCRPC with a median time of 11.8 mo (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.1-18.4). The median time to prostate-specific antigen progression on first-line AR-targeted therapy in the mCRPC setting was 3.3 mo (95% CI 2.7-3.9). Ten out of 11 evaluable patients with germline BRCA2 mutations had somatic deletion of the intact allele in ctDNA. A limitation of this study is absence of a formal control cohort for comparison of clinical outcomes.  Conclusions:   Patients with mCRPC who have germline DNA repair defects exhibit attenuated responses to AR-targeted therapy. Biallelic gene loss was robustly detected in ctDNA, suggesting that this patient subset could be prioritized for therapies exploiting defective DNA repair using a liquid biopsy.

Considering recent recommendations against PSA screening, high-risk populations (e.g. black men, men with a high baseline PSA) may be particularly vulnerable in the coming years. Thus, we investigated the relationship between baseline PSA and future prostate cancer in a black majority-minority urban population.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed of the prostate biopsy database (n = 994) at the Brooklyn Veterans Affairs Hospital. These men were referred to urology clinic for elevated PSA and biopsied between 2007 and 2014. Multivariate logistic regression was used to predict positive prostate biopsy from log-transformed baseline PSA, race (black, white, or other), and several other variables.  Results:   The majority of men identified as black (50.2%). Median age at time of baseline PSA and biopsy was 58.6 and 64.8, respectively. Median baseline PSA was similar among black men and white men (2.70 vs 2.91 for black men vs white men, p = 0.232). Even so, black men were more likely than white men to be diagnosed with prostate cancer (OR 1.62, p < 0.0001). Black men less than age 70 were at particularly greater risk than their white counterparts. Baseline PSA was not a statistically significant predictor of future prostate cancer (p = 0.101).  Conclusions:   Black men were more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than were white men, despite comparable baseline PSA. In our pre-screened population at the urology clinic, a retrospective examination of baseline PSA did not predict future prostate cancer.""","""['Daniel P Verges', 'Hasan Dani', 'William A Sterling', 'Jeremy Weedon', 'William Atallah', 'Komal Mehta', 'David Schreiber', 'Jeffrey P Weiss', 'Nicholas T Karanikolas']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Natl Med Assoc""","""['The impact of African American race on prostate cancer detection on repeat prostate biopsy in a veteran population.', 'Probability of an abnormal screening prostate-specific antigen result based on age, race, and prostate-specific antigen threshold.', 'Prostate specific antigen remains an independent predictor of cancer at prostate biopsy in black american men but not in white men: results from a consecutive series of 914 men.', 'Social ecological predictors of prostate-specific antigen blood test and digital rectal examination in black American men.', 'Prostate-specific antigen concentration in young men: new estimates and review of the literature.', 'Disparities in the Utilization of Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer in the United States: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Tobacco and marijuana use and their association with serum prostate-specific antigen levels among African American men in Chicago.', 'Prostate cancer screening-when to start and how to screen?']"""

The index lesion was defined as the lesion with the greatest Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, version 2 (PIRADS-v2), score. MRI-GBs were performed with a nonmagnetic biopsy device, needle guide, and titanium double-shoot biopsy gun with dedicated software for needle tracking. Clinically significant PCa was defined as the presence of Gleason score ≥ 7 in the biopsy specimen.  Results:   Seventy index lesions were scheduled for MRI-GB. The median PIRADS-v2 score and the median number of cores per patient was 4 of 5 (interquartile range, 3-5) and 2 (interquartile range, 1-3), respectively. The PCa detection rate was 45.7%.

Aim:   To investigate orgasmic dysfunction, urinary incontinence during sexual activity, changes in penile morphology, and sensory disturbances in the penis in patients with prostate cancer treated with external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT).  Methods:   In February 2015, men treated with EBRT at our center 3 months to 5 years previously (N = 519) received a study-specific questionnaire. This was developed from purpose-built questions and validated tools including the Erection Hardness Scale. All patients had received a radiation dose of 78 Gy. Androgen deprivation therapy was administered according to disease characteristics.  Main outcome measures:   Outcome measurements were prevalence rates and predictors of these side effects as identified by multivariate logistic regression analyses.  Results:   One hundred nine patients were eligible (sexually active and had completed androgen deprivation therapy) for inclusion. Twenty-four percent reported anorgasmia, 44% reported a decreased intensity of their orgasms, and 40% reported that the time it took to reach orgasm had increased. Eleven percent reported anejaculation. Fifteen percent reported orgasm-associated pain. Only 4% reported urinary incontinence during sexual activity. Subjective penile length loss in excess of 1 cm was reported by 42%. Twelve percent reported an altered curvature of their penis after EBRT. Six percent reported painful erections. Twenty-seven percent reported decreased sensitivity in the penis after EBRT, 2% reported a cold sensation, and 2% reported paresthesia. Increasing time since final treatment increased the risk of penile sensory disturbances (odds ratio = 1.05; P = .028).  Conclusion:   Orgasmic dysfunction, changes in penile morphology, and sensory disturbances in the penis are common side effects of ERBT.

The management of low risk patients varied significantly between centers (P<0.0001), according to the therapeutic platforms available within the hospital.  Conclusions:   In absence of strong progression predictor, the management of low risk PCa remains based on center habits and local therapeutic platforms. New predictive markers, such as multiparametric MRI or molecular tests, are needed to guide rational management of low risk PCa.

Methods and materials:   Leveraging The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal, 9 tumor types were analyzed. The frequency distribution of cancer by age was determined and compared with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. Using the estimated median somatic mutational frequency of each tumor type, the samples needed beyond TCGA to detect a 10% mutational frequency were calculated. Microarray data from a separate prospective cohort were obtained from primary prostatectomy samples to determine whether elderly-specific transcriptomic alterations could be identified.  Results:   Of the 5236 TCGA samples, 73% were from patients aged <70 years. Comparing the distribution of TCGA samples by age to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, patients <70 years were well represented across most tumor types, but patients aged 80 to 99 years were underrepresented in all cancers (median TCGA underrepresentation of 167%). All cancers (except for colorectal) contained enough samples to detect a 10% mutational frequency in patients aged <60 years. In contrast, no cancer type had enough samples for which a 10% mutational frequency could be detected in patients aged ≥80 years. To further interrogate whether elderly patients with cancer were likely to harbor age-specific molecular abnormalities, we accessed transcriptomic data from a separate, larger database of >2000 prostate cancer samples. That analysis revealed significant differences in the expression of 10 genes in patients aged ≥70 years compared with those <70 years, of which 7 are involved in androgen signaling and/or DNA repair.  Conclusions:   Elderly patients have been underrepresented in genomic sequencing studies. Our data suggest the presence of elderly-specific molecular alterations.

Methods:   Human prostate cancer DU-145 cells were injected into 24 nude male mice. The mice were divided into 3 groups according to the time of transplantation (6, 8, and 10 weeks). The volume, elasticity, and Young modulus of tumors were recorded by 2-dimensional sonography and shear wave elastography. The tumors were collected for pathologic analyses: hematoxylin-eosin staining, Ponceau S, and aniline staining were used to stain collagen and elastic fibers, and picric acid-sirius red staining was used to indicate type I and III collagen. The area ratios of collagen I/III were calculated. The correlation between the Young modulus of the tumor and area ratio of collagen I/III were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry of vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin was performed.  Results:   Nineteen tumors in 3 groups were collected. The volume and mean Young modulus increased with the time of transplantation. There were more collagen fibers in the stiff tumors, and there were significant differences in the area ratios of collagen I/III between groups 1 (mean ± SD, 0.50 ± 0.17) and 3 (1.97 ± 0.56; P < .01). The Young modulus of the tumors showed a very significant correlation with the area ratios of collagen I/III (r = 0.968; P < .05). The expression level of α-smooth muscle actin protein was higher in group 3 than in the other groups, but differences in vimentin expression were barely seen.  Conclusions:   Shear wave elastography is a novel useful technology for showing the elasticity of human prostate cancer xenograft implantation tumors. Collagen fibers, especially collagen type I, play a crucial role in the elasticity in the human prostate cancer xenograft implantation model.""","""['Yiru Wang', 'Binwei Yao', 'Hongfei Li', 'Yan Zhang', 'Hanjing Gao', 'Yabin Gao', 'Ruiyun Peng', 'Jie Tang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Ultrasound Med""","""['Transrectal real-time tissue elastography - an effective way to distinguish benign and malignant prostate tumors.', 'Shear wave elastography for localization of prostate cancer lesions and assessment of elasticity thresholds: implications for targeted biopsies and active surveillance protocols.', 'Assessment of the arterial stiffness in patients with acute ischemic stroke using longitudinal elasticity modulus measurements obtained with Shear Wave Elastography.', 'The Evolving Role of Shear Wave Elastography in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Ultrasound Elastography and MR Elastography for Assessing Liver Fibrosis: Part 1, Principles and Techniques.', 'Stretchable ultrasonic arrays for the three-dimensional mapping of the modulus of deep tissue.', 'Atorvastatin regulates the migration and invasion of prostate cancer through the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and matrix metalloproteinase pathways.', 'DNA methyltransferase 3 beta regulates promoter methylation of microRNA-149 to augment esophageal squamous cell carcinoma development through the ring finger protein 2/Wnt/β-catenin axis.', 'Imaging methods to evaluate tumor microenvironment factors affecting nanoparticle drug delivery and antitumor response.', 'Transforming Growth Factor-β: An Agent of Change in the Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Materials and methods:   A retrospective registry analysis identified 150 men who underwent focal salvage HIFU (FS-HIFU) (Sonablate 500) between November 2006 and August 2015. Metastatic disease was excluded by nodal assessment on the pelvic MRI, a radioisotope bone scan and positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging (choline-18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET or choline PET-CT). In our current clinical practice, metastatic disease must be excluded by both choline PET and bone scan. Localization of cancer was carried out using multiparametric MRI of the prostate (T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging) with systematic or template prostate mapping biopsies. The primary outcome was a composite failure incorporating biochemical failure (BCF) and/or positive localized or distant imaging results and/or positive biopsy and/or systemic therapy and/or metastases/prostate cancer-specific death. The secondary outcome was BCF using the Phoenix-ASTRO definition (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] nadir + 2 ng/mL). We used Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression to quantify the effect of the determinants on the endpoints.  Results:   The mean (standard deviation [sd]) patient age at focal salvage HIFU was 69.8 (6.1) years and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) PSA pre-focal salvage HIFU was 5.5 (3.6-7.9) ng/mL. The median (IQR) follow-up was 35 (22-52) months. Patients were classified as having low- 2.7% (4/150), intermediate- 39.3% (59/150) and high-risk disease 41.3% (62/150) according to D'Amico classification, prior to focal salvage HIFU. Composite failure occurred in 61% of patients (91/150) and BCF occurred in 51.3% (77/150). The Kaplan-Meier composite endpoint-free survival (CEFS) rate at 3 years was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI] 31-50) for the entire group. Kaplan-Meier estimates of CEFS were 100%, 49% and 24% at 3 years in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups pre-salvage HIFU, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) rate at 3 years was 48% (95% CI 39-59) for the entire group. Kaplan-Meier estimates of BDFS were 100%, 61% and 32% at 3 years in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups pre-salvage HIFU, respectively. Complications included urinary tract infection (11.3%; 17/150), bladder neck stricture (8%; 12/150), recto-urethral fistula after one HIFU procedure (2%; 3/150) and osteitis pubis (0.7%; 1/150).  Conclusion:   Focal salvage HIFU conferred a relatively low complication and side effect rate. CEFS and biochemical control in the short to medium term were reasonable, especially in this relatively high-risk cohort, but still low compared with current whole-gland salvage therapies. Focal salvage therapy may offer disease control in men at high risk whilst minimizing additional treatment morbidities.""","""['Abi Kanthabalan', 'Max Peters', 'Marco Van Vulpen', 'Neil McCartan', 'Richard Graham Hindley', 'Amr Emara', 'Caroline M Moore', 'Manit Arya', 'Mark Emberton', 'Hashim Uddin Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['High-intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) as salvage therapy for radio-recurrent prostate cancer: predictors of disease response.', 'Development and internal validation of prediction models for biochemical failure and composite failure after focal salvage high intensity focused ultrasound for local radiorecurrent prostate cancer: Presentation of risk scores for individual patient prognoses.', 'Locally recurrent prostate cancer after initial radiation therapy: early salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound improves oncologic outcomes.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for definitive treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Current salvage methods for recurrent prostate cancer after failure of primary radiotherapy.', 'Applications of Focused Ultrasound in the Treatment of Genitourinary Cancers.', 'A Review of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound in Urology.', 'Oncologic outcome of salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in radiorecurrent prostate cancer.

Two independent radiologists recorded the PI-RADSv2 scores and measured the corresponding ADC values in each patient. A composite score was generated to assess the performance of combining PI-RADSv2 + ADC.  Results:   PCA was upgraded on confirmatory biopsy in 107/371 (29%) patients. Inter-reader agreement was substantial (PI-RADSv2: k = 0.73; 95% CI [0.66-0.80]; ADC: r = 0.74; 95% CI [0.69-0.79]).

However, the more detailed molecular mechanisms of aspirin to suppress prostate cancer cell invasion have not been clearly elucidated.  Methods:   Transwell assays were performed to evaluate the effects of aspirin on cell invasion. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and serine proteinases activities in cell media were examined by gelatin zymography and ELISA. In addition, inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase-β (IKK-β) phosphorylation and IKK-β kinase activity were measured to assess the effects of aspirin on IKK-β activation.  Results:   We found that aspirin suppressed the invasion and attachment in human prostate cancer cells. Aspirin treatment significantly resulted in reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and upregulation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) activity, which are the proteolytic enzymes contributing to the degradation of extracellular matrix and basement membrane in cell invasion and metastasis. Our data further showed that aspirin was able to inhibit both urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression in the cells. In addition, aspirin treatment caused a strong decrease in nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation, inhibitor of κB (IκB)-α phosphorylation together with translocation of NF-κB p65 to nucleus and IκB kinase (IKK)- β activation. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of aspirin on cell invasion were reversed by IKK-β overexpression, while the IKK inhibitor sensitizes the anti-invasive effect of aspirin in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusion:   The present research concluded that aspirin suppressed prostate cancer cell invasion by reducing MMP-9 activity and uPA expression through decreasing of IKK-β-mediated NF-κB activation, indicating that the ability of aspirin to inhibit cell invasion might be useful in the chemoprevention of metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Chongjun Shi', 'Nini Zhang', 'Yang Feng', 'Jiewei Cao', 'Xuyi Chen', 'Bin Liu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['PKD2 and PKD3 promote prostate cancer cell invasion by modulating NF-κB- and HDAC1-mediated expression and activation of uPA.', 'Doxycycline down-regulates matrix metalloproteinase expression and inhibits NF-κB signaling in LPS-induced PC3 cells.', 'Activity and expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinases in human colorectal cancer.', ""Osteopontin: it's role in regulation of cell motility and nuclear factor kappa B-mediated urokinase type plasminogen activator expression."", 'Multifunctional potential of the plasminogen activation system in tumor invasion and metastasis (review).', 'Glycolysis-related lncRNA TMEM105 upregulates LDHA to facilitate breast cancer liver metastasis via sponging miR-1208.', 'Implementing subtype-specific pre-clinical models of breast cancer to study pre-treatment aspirin effects.', 'Targeting Inflammatory Signaling in Prostate Cancer Castration Resistance.', 'Aspirin Actions in Treatment of NSAID-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease.', 'Acetylsalicylic Acid Exerts Potent Antitumor and Antiangiogenic Effects in Cutaneous and Uveal Melanoma Cell Lines.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively selected 58 patients who underwent, between June 2010 and February 2013, both FCh-PET/CT and MDP-BS within a maximum time interval of 5months. All patients had a biochemical PCa recurrence after radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy. Two independent observers reviewed FCh-PET/CT and MDP-BS images. The bone window of CT portion from FCh-PET/CT was separately assessed. Time to progression (TTP), skeletal event free survival (SES) and cancer specific survival (CSS) were defined as the length of time between imaging and progression of disease, skeletal related events and cancer specific mortality, respectively. A patient based and a K agreement analysis was used to compare the findings of all three imaging modalities. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis were computed for survival assessment. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to identify the independent predictors for TTP.  Results:   Bone metastases were detected in 22 (38%) patients at FCh-PET/CT, in 27 (47%) at MDP-BS and in 24 (41%) at CT. The agreement between FCh-PET/CT and MDP-BS, CT and MDP-BS, and FCh-PET/CT and CT were moderate/fair (respectively, k: 0.474, 0.267 and 0.424; all p<0.05). After 38months (IQR: 27-54months) of follow-up, 33 (57%) patients had a new recurrence of disease, 12 (21%) had skeletal related events and 19 (33%) died.

At univariate analysis, a positive FCh-PET/CT at skeletal level was associated with all events (all p<0.05).

Methods:   Urologists (N = 176) provided retrospective chart data for patients with mCRPC (N = 445) via online surveys. Descriptive analyses and chi-square tests evaluated treatment patterns and their differences by SSE presence; generalized linear mixed models examined healthcare resource utilization differences as a function of SSEs.  Results:   Patients were on average 73.6 years old (SD = 8.3), diagnosed with prostate cancer 5.1 years (SD = 6.2), castration-resistant 2.3 years (SD=2.0), and had 7.9 bone metastases sites (SD=12.4). Novel anti-hormones showed increased adoption as mCRPC treatment. Simultaneously, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist/antagonist use was common (43.6% of patients in 1st line), even as CRPC treatment had started. SSEs were uncommon (2-3% per treatment line; 5% at any time), but were associated with increased opioids, strontium-89, bisphosphonates, and NSAIDs use, plus increased healthcare visits (all p < .05).

Findings from Project EMPOWER""","""Objectives:   Randomized controlled trials, especially the Early Palliative Care Study (Temel et al., 2010), have shown that early outpatient palliative cancer care can improve quality of life for patients with advanced cancer or serious symptoms. However, fear and misconceptions drive avoidance of palliative care. Drawing from an empowerment perspective, we examined whether educating patients about evidence from the Early Palliative Care Study would increase preferences for palliative care.  Method:   A sample of 598 patients with prostate, breast, lung, colon/rectal, skin, and other cancer diagnoses completed an Internet-mediated experiment using a between-group prepost design. Intervention participants received a summary of the Early Palliative Care Study; controls received no intervention. Participants completed baseline and posttest assessments of preferences of palliative care. Analyses controlled for age, gender, education, cancer type, presence of metastases, time since diagnosis, and baseline preferences.  Results:   As hypothesized, the intervention had a favorable impact on participants' preferences for outpatient palliative cancer care relative to controls (d = 1.01, p < .001), while controlling for covariates. Intervention participants came to view palliative care as more efficacious (d = 0.79, p < .001) and less scary (d = 0.60, p < .001) and exhibited stronger behavioral intentions to utilize outpatient palliative care if referred (d = 0.60, p < .001). Findings were comparable in patients with metastatic disease, those with less education, and those experiencing financial strain.  Conclusions:   Educating patients about the Early Palliative Care Study increases preferences for early outpatient palliative care. This research has implications for future studies aimed at improving quality of life in cancer by increasing palliative care utilization.

However, this index is not specific for patients with bladder cancer (BCa) treated with radical cystectomy (RC). The goal of this study was to develop a short-form of the original DaCCI (DaCCI-SF) that may specifically predict 90-day mortality after RC, with equal or better accuracy. Patients and Methods: Between 2000 and 2009, we identified 7,076 patients in the SEER-Medicare database with stage T1 through T4 nonmetastatic BCa treated with RC. We randomly divided the population into development (n=6,076) and validation (n=1,000) cohorts. Within the development cohort, logistic regression models tested the ability to predict 90-day mortality with various iterations of the DaCCI-SF, wherein <17 original comorbid condition groupings were included after adjusting for age, sex, race, T stage, and N stage. We relied on the Akaike information criterion to identify the most parsimonious and informative set of comorbid condition groupings. Accuracy of the DaCCI and the DaCCI-SF was tested in the external validation cohort. Results: Within the development cohort, the most parsimonious and informative model resulted in the inclusion of 3 of the 17 (17.6%) original comorbid condition groupings: congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic pulmonary disease. Within the validation cohort, the accuracy was 68.4% for the DaCCI versus 69.7% for the DaCCI-SF. Higher accuracy of the DaCCI-SF was confirmed in subgroup analyses performed according to age (≤75 vs >75 years), stage (organ-confined vs non-organ-confined), type of diversion (ileal-conduit vs non-ileal-conduit), and treatment period.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor cabozantinib showed striking responses in cancer clinical trial patients across several malignancies. Here, we show that cabozantinib rapidly eradicates invasive, poorly differentiated PTEN/p53-deficient murine prostate cancer. This was associated with enhanced release of neutrophil chemotactic factors from tumor cells, including CXCL12 and HMGB1, resulting in robust infiltration of neutrophils into the tumor.

Down-regulation of the EMT-inducing transcription factor ZEB1, which also plays a role in homologous recombination-mediated repair of DNA lesions by regulating CHK1 expression, was found to be a major determinant of miR-875-5p-induced radiosensitization, as confirmed by phenocopy experiments showing that siRNA-mediated ZEB1 knock-down was able to reproduce the microRNA radiosensitizing effect.

A total of 1428 fractions delivered to 41 treated patients (16 intact prostate, 25 fossa) were analyzed regarding the agreement of alignments between the 2 US positioning systems. Patients were first aligned to tattoos using treatment room lasers. TA-USIG using the 3D system was then performed to align contours derived during the computed tomography simulation process to their corresponding daily US-visualized structures. The US-3D system image guidance shifts were performed and recorded as the ""initial"" shifts. A 2.5D system alignment was then immediately performed using the same computed tomography derived reference contours and the indicated shifts, relative to the 3D system, were recorded as the difference between the 2 alignment methods.  Results:   The average difference between the 2 TA-USIG alignments for all patients was 0.4 ± 0.7 mm, 0.7 ± 0.9 mm, and 0.5 ± 0.9 mm in the left-right, anteroposterior, and superoinferior directions, respectively. No significant difference in system agreement between intact prostate versus fossa patients was observed.  Conclusion:   Our comparison of an established 2.5D USIG method with a newer, fully 3D approach for prostate alignment of 41 different patients (1428 fractions) shows excellent agreement with each other, despite the nontrivial difference in imaging approaches. This shows that the 2 specific USIG approaches yield results that are consistent with each other, and that the USIG modality yields consistent results within the modality.""","""['Bill J Salter', 'Martin Szegedi', 'Christine Boehm', 'Vikren Sarkar', 'Prema Rassiah-Szegedi', 'Brian Wang', 'Hui Zhao', 'Jessica Huang', 'Long Huang', 'Kris Kokeny', 'Jonathan D Tward']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Comparison of transperineal ultrasound image guidance technique to transabdominal technique for prostate radiation therapy.', 'Semiautomatic registration of 3D transabdominal ultrasound images for patient repositioning during postprostatectomy radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of multiple image-based modalities for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate carcinoma: a prospective study.', 'Ultrasound-based stereotactic guidance in prostate cancer--quantification of organ motion and set-up errors in external beam radiation therapy.', 'Prostate cancer: image guidance and adaptive therapy.', 'The Use of Ultrasound Imaging in the External Beam Radiotherapy Workflow of Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Methods and materials:   Of 718 patients consecutively treated with postoperative radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer between 1992 and 2013, we retrospectively identified 171 men receiving ART and 230 receiving ESRT (RT delivered at a prostate-specific antigen level ≤0.5 ng/mL) who had adverse pathologic features. Postirradiation FFBF (BF was defined as prostate-specific antigen level rise to ≥0.2 ng/mL), FFADT, FFDM, and OS were compared using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods. Propensity score (PS)-matching was performed to estimate treatment effects while accounting for covariates predicting treatment allocation.  Results:   Median follow-up was 7.4 and 8.0 years for patients treated with ART and ESRT, respectively. Ten-year FFBF (69% vs 56%, P = .003) and 10-year FFADT (88% vs 81%, P = .046) rates were higher after ART; however, FFDM and OS did not significantly differ. After PS-matching, ART was associated with improved FFBF (P < .0001), FFADT (P = .0001), and FFDM (P = .02). Findings were confirmed in multivariable analyses in unmatched and PS-matched cohorts. Sensitivity analyses showed that FFBF benefit associated with ART lost statistical significance only after 38% of ART patients were assumed to have been cured by surgery and excluded from the model. This corresponds to the upper bound of patients with adverse pathologic features who did not recur after observation in prior randomized trials.  Conclusions:   Postoperative RT confers excellent long-term cancer control. These results suggest ART may be associated with improved FFBF, FFADT, and FFDM, but comparable OS. Given the retrospective study design, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Optimal timing of postoperative RT further awaits results of ongoing trials.""","""['Daniela L Buscariollo', 'Michael Drumm', 'Andrzej Niemierko', 'Rebecca H Clayman', 'Sigolene Galland-Girodet', 'Danielle Rodin', 'Adam S Feldman', 'Douglas M Dahl', 'Francis J McGovern', 'Aria F Olumi', 'Alec Eidelman', 'William U Shipley', 'Anthony L Zietman', 'Jason A Efstathiou']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Comparison Between Adjuvant and Early-Salvage Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer With Adverse Pathological Features.', 'Early salvage radiation therapy does not compromise cancer control in patients with pT3N0 prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: results of a match-controlled multi-institutional analysis.', 'Long-term Impact of Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in pT3N0 Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Multi-institutional Series.', 'Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage Radiation Therapy Following Radical Prostatectomy for Men with Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'A meta-analysis on the use of radiotherapy after prostatectomy: adjuvant versus early salvage radiation.', 'Radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: Effect of timing of postprostatectomy radiation on functional outcomes.', 'Cell cycle progression score improves risk stratification in prostate cancer patients with adverse pathology after radical prostatectomy.', 'The prognosis benefits of adjuvant versus salvage radiotherapy for patients after radical prostatectomy with adverse pathological features: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Early and late toxicity profiles of patients receiving immediate postoperative radiotherapy versus salvage radiotherapy for prostate cancer after prostatectomy.']"""

Long-term patient-reported symptoms have been described for individuals who completed radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer. However, the trajectory of symptom development during the course of treatment has not been well-described in patients receiving modern, image-guided RT.  Methods and materials:   Quality-of-life data were prospectively collected for 111 prostate cancer patients undergoing RT using the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices, which assessed 5 urinary obstructive/irritative and 6 bowel symptoms. Patients who received definitive RT (N = 73) and postprostatectomy RT (N = 38) were analyzed separately. The frequency and severity of symptoms over multiple time points are reported.  Results:   An increasing number of patients had clinically meaningful urinary and bowel symptoms over the course of RT. A greater proportion of patients undergoing definitive RT reported clinically meaningful urinary symptoms at the end of RT compared with baseline in terms of flow (33% vs 19%) and frequency (39% vs 18%). Individuals receiving postprostatectomy radiation also reported an increase in symptoms including frequency (29% vs 3%) and nocturia (50% vs 21%). Clinically meaningful bowel symptoms were less commonly reported. Patients receiving definitive RT reported an increase in diarrhea (9% vs 4%) and urgency (12% vs 6%) at the completion of RT compared with baseline. Both bowel and urinary symptoms approached their baseline levels by the time of first follow-up after treatment completion. The majority of patients who had clinically meaningful urinary or bowel symptoms during RT did not have them at 2 years or beyond, and development of new symptoms in the long term was uncommon.  Conclusions:   There is a modest increase in urinary and bowel symptoms over the course of treatment for individuals receiving definitive and postprostatectomy image-guided RT. These data can help inform both providers and patients regarding the trajectory of symptoms and allow for reasonable expectations regarding toxicity under treatment.""","""['Kevin Diao', 'Emily A Lobos', 'Eda Yirmibesoglu', 'Ram Basak', 'Laura H Hendrix', 'Brittney Barbosa', 'Seth M Miller', 'Kevin A Pearlstein', 'Gregg H Goldin', 'Andrew Z Wang', 'Ronald C Chen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Patient-reported quality of life during radiation treatment for localized prostate cancer: results from a prospective phase II trial.', 'Image Guided Hypofractionated Postprostatectomy Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Phase 2 trial of guideline-based postoperative image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: Toxicity, biochemical, and patient-reported health-related quality-of-life outcomes.', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Functional outcomes and complications following radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a critical analysis of the literature.', 'Symptoms predicting health-related quality of life in prostate cancer patients treated with localized radiation therapy.', 'Utilization of Patient-Reported Outcomes to Guide Symptom Management during Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Seventy-eight patients diagnosed with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer and treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy alone were reviewed retrospectively. All patients received a total dose of 38 Gy in 4 fractions with a planning target volume expansion of 2 mm. GU toxicity was documented according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4. ROC analysis applied on a logistic regression model was used to determine optimal dosimetric parameters for GU toxicity.  Results:   The median age at treatment was 69 years with a median prostate volume of 46.2 mL. The median prescription isodose line was 67% (interquartile range, 65, 70). The median clinical follow-up was 35.49 months. Late grade 1, 2, and 3 GU toxicity occurred in 21.8%, 19.2%, and 2.6% of cases, respectively. Late grade 2+ GU toxicity was associated with prescription to isodose line (P = .009) and normalized volumes for heterogeneity ≥46 Gy. The ROC method successfully produced thresholds for dose-volume recommendations for both prostate and urethra, including normalized prostate volumes from 46 to 50 Gy, such as volume of target tissue receiving 46% of the prescribed dose (V46) Gy of 36.7% (sensitivity, 71%; specificity, 61%; area under the curve, 0.67) with an associated probability of late GU grade 2+ toxicity of 21%.  Conclusions:   Intraprostatic heterogeneity should be controlled with potential thresholds at V46 Gy <36.7%, V48 Gy <21%, and V50 Gy <9.5% of the normalized prostate volume to keep late grade 2+ GU toxicity ≤20% with 4-fraction schemes.

With the development of highly accurate radiotherapy devices, prostate salvage re-irradiation might generate lower toxicity rates than classical salvage therapies. We retrospectively evaluated the toxicity and the feasibility of a prostate re-irradiation after definitive radiation therapy failure. Two modalities were investigated: high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRB) on whole prostate gland and focal stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) using CyberKnife® linac.  Methods:   Between 2011 and 2015, 28 patients with imaged and/or biopsy-proven intra-prostatic recurrence of cancer after definitive radiation therapy underwent a salvage re-irradiation using HDRB (n = 10) or focal SBRT (n = 18). The schedule of re-irradiation was 35 Gy in 5 fractions. Biological response (defined as post-salvage radiation PSA variation) and biochemical no-evidence of disease (bNED) were evaluated in the whole cohort. For patients who had a positive biological response after salvage radiation, biochemical recurrence (BCR) and survival after salvage radiotherapy were evaluated. Post-salvage toxicities were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 and were compared to baseline status.  Results:   Within a median follow-up of 22.5 months (IQR = 8-42), 9 (90%) patients experienced a positive biological response after salvage HDRB and 5 (50%) remained bNED at the end of the follow-up. Among patients who initially responded to salvage HDRB, the BCR rate was 44.4% after a median interval of 19.5 months (IQR = 11.5-26). Only one patient experienced a transient grade 3 urinary complication. In the SBRT group, the median follow-up was 14.5 months (IQR = 7-23) and 10 (55.6%) out of the 18 patients remained bNED. Among the 15 patients who initially responded to salvage SBRT, 5 (33.3%) experienced a BCR. One patient experienced a transient grade 4 urinary complication. At the end of the follow-up, all evaluated patients had a urinary status grade variation ≤ +1 grade. No grade 3-4 digestive toxicity was observed.  Conclusions:   Salvage prostate re-irradiation for locally recurrent cancer is feasible and generate low toxicities rates when using with HDRB or focal SBRT.

In this study, we evaluated a novel 99mTc-labeled small molecular inhibitor of PSMA.  Methods:   This new small-molecular inhibitor of PSMA, 6-hydrazinonicotinate-Aminocaproic acid-Lysine-Urea-Glutamate (HYNIC-ALUG) was radiolabeled by 99mTc and was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo using PCa models (PC-3 and LNCaP). Radiation dosimetry was assessed in mice.  Results: 99mTc-HYNIC-ALUG showed excellent stability in different media. A cell assay preliminarily displayed its specificity for PSMA. The inhibitor showed good pharmacokinetics making it suitable for in vivo imaging. PC-3-derived tumors showed no obvious radioactive uptake; however, the LNCaP-derived tumors showed very high radioactive uptake which was significantly decreased by the selective PSMA inhibitor 2-PMPA. Biodistribution in LNCaP xenografts showed an optimum tumor-to-blood ratio of 24.23±3.54 at 2h. Tumor uptake was also decreased in the inhibition experiment with 2-PMPA (19.45±2.14%ID/g versus 1.42±0.15%ID/g at 2h). The effective dose of the 99mTc-HYNIC-ALUG was 8.4E-04mSv/MBq.  Conclusions:   A new 99mTc-labeled PSMA inhibitor with specific accumulation in PSMA-positive tumors and low background in other organs was synthesized.

In contrast, SRC-2 promotes survival and metastasis in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a tissue-specific and context-dependent role for SRC-2 in tumorigenesis. To determine if genetic loss of SRC-2 is sufficient to accelerate MYC-mediated liver tumorigenesis, we bred Src-2-/- mice with a MYC-induced liver tumor model and observed a significant increase in liver tumor burden. RNA sequencing of liver tumors and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed a set of direct target genes that are bound by SRC-2 and exhibit downregulated expression in Src-2-/- liver tumors. We demonstrate that activation of SHP (Small Heterodimer Partner), DKK4 (Dickkopf-4), and CADM4 (Cell Adhesion Molecule 4) by SRC-2 suppresses tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo.

The effects of DFP were evaluated at different cellular levels: cell culture proliferation and migration; metabolism of live cells (time-course multi-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy cell perfusion studies, with 1-13 C-glucose, and extracellular flux analysis); and expression (Western blot) and activity of mitochondrial aconitase, an iron-dependent enzyme. The 50% and 90% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 and IC90 , respectively) of DFP for the three cell lines after 48 h of incubation were within the ranges 51-67 μM and 81-186 μM, respectively. Exposure to 100 μM DFP led to: (i) significant inhibition of cell migration after different exposure times, ranging from 12 h (TRAMP-C2) to 48 h (22rv1), in agreement with the respective cell doubling times; (ii) significantly decreased glucose consumption and glucose-driven tricarboxylic acid cycle activity in metastatic TRAMP-C2 cells, during the first 10 h of exposure, and impaired cellular bioenergetics and membrane phospholipid turnover after 23 h of exposure, consistent with a cytostatic effect of DFP. At this time point, all cell lines studied showed: (iii) significant decreases in mitochondrial functional parameters associated with the oxygen consumption rate, and (iv) significantly lower mitochondrial aconitase expression and activity.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the most important drugs in the CML therapy and provide long disease-free survival. Due to the increased survival of CML patients with continual administration of these drugs, the chance of development of secondary malignancies may increase. The most common secondary malignancies are prostate, colorectal and lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, malignant melanoma, non-melanoma skin tumors and breast cancer. Herein, we are describing a rare case of Hodgkin lymphoma in a patient of CML after ten year of primary disease presentation. Hodgkin lymphoma in a known case of CML is very rare and further studies are also needed to know the pathogenic relationship between the two entities and to assess the risk of secondary Hodgkin lymphoma in CML patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CML itself is a risk factor for development of solid cancers and hematologic malignancies.

We aimed to determine the cumulative incidence of/risk factors for long-term cancer-related mortality in patients with PSC after LT.  Methods:   All adult patients underwent LT for PSC without cholangiocarcinoma from 1984 to 2012, with follow-up through June 2015. We estimated cumulative incidence, risk factors, and mortality from de novo malignancies after LT.  Results:   Two hundred ninety-three patients were identified (mean [SD] age, 47 [12] years; 63.3% males; 2.4% smoking at LT). Over a median of 11.5 years (range, 6.4-18.6 years), 64 patients (21.8%) developed 73 nonskin cancers, including 46 solid-organ cancers (renal, 11; colorectal, 11; prostate, 7; breast, 5; pancreas, 5; ovarian/endometrial/vulvar cancers, 3; and de novo cholangiocarcinoma, 4). Twenty-two patients developed hematologic malignancies (posttransplant lymphoproliferative diseases, 18; Hodgkin disease, 2; and myelodysplastic syndrome, 2). Five patients developed melanoma. The 1-, 5-, 10-, and 20-year cumulative incidences of cancer were 2.1%, 8.6%, 18.7%, and 27%, respectively. Mortality of patients with PSC who developed cancer was higher than that of patients with PSC without cancer (hazard ratio, 2.2; P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, recipient's age and elevated pre-LT international normalized ratio were associated with increased risk of de novo (nonskin) malignancy.  Conclusion:   The 10-year cumulative risk of cancer after LT for advanced-stage PSC was 18.7%, with posttransplant lymphoproliferative diseases, colorectal cancer, and renal cell cancer being the most common.

Aim of this study was to investigate statistical associations between the risk of prostate cancer and the rs1058205 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the KLK3 gene, which encodes the prostate specific antigen (PSA), in a case-control study of Han Chinese men in Northeast China.  Methods:   Using a high-resolution melting curve genotyping method, we determined the genotype and allele distributions of rs1058205 in 2 groups of Han Chinese men, consisting of 268 PCa patients and 298 healthy control subjects. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between rs1058205 genotypes and the risk of PCa. Tumor staging and Gleason score were included in a stratified analysis of PCa risk.  Results:   The frequency of the TC genotype of rs1058205 in the PCa group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.049). The serum PSA level in participants with the TC genotype was significantly lower than that of the TT and CC genotypes in both the PCa and control groups (P < 0.010 for both). The TT genotype was associated with PCa, both with and without adjustment for age (P < 0.010 and P = 0.047, respectively). The TT genotype was also associated with the moderate- and high-risk PCa categories (P = 0.007 and 0.027, respectively).

Methods:   Forty-five consecutive patients with clinically localised prostate cancer were treated with SBRT using CyberKnife technology and enrolled in this study. Protocol treatment consisted of 36.25 Gy in five fractions. PSA and acute toxicity was assessed at each follow-up visit and QOL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Global Health Status (GHS) C30 and PR25 questionnaires and the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Distance of travel for treatment was recorded.  Results:   The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level declined from the initial value of 6.9 ng/mL to 1.5 ng/mL at 6 months and 0.6 ng/mL at 18 months post-treatment. Results were similar in patients who did not receive hormone therapy. Acute grade 1 gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities were found in 11.1% and 24.4% of patients respectively. Acute grade 2 GI and GU toxicities were found in 2.2% and 11.1% of patients respectively. There were no grade 3 and grade 4 toxicities. Mean urinary symptom score was 14.8 at baseline, 17.2 at 6 weeks and 18.3 at 6 months (P > 0.05). Mean bowel symptom score was 2.7 at baseline, 4.2 at 6 weeks and 6.3 at 6 months (P > 0.05). The mean GHS score improved from 81.3 at baseline to 82.4 at 6 weeks, and was 75.6 at 6 months (P > 0.05, not significant).

Patient-provider communication is important for the PrCA screening decision process. The study purpose was to better understand the current dialogue between primary care providers (PCPs-physicians and nurse practitioners) and AA men about PrCA prevention and screening. An online survey with 46 PCPs, education sessions (including pre/post surveys) with 56 AA men, and a forum with 5 panelists and 38 AA men for open dialogue were held to examine both provider and community perspectives on PrCA communication needs and practices. PCPs' perceptions of PrCA screening were varied and they used different PrCA screening guidelines in their practices. PCPs and AA men had different experiences with PrCA communication. PCPs reported that they have discussions about PrCA screening and prostate health with AA patients; few AA men reported these same experiences. About 38.0% of PCPs reported that they remain neutral about PSA testing during discussions; however, only 10.7% of AA men reported that their doctor remained neutral.

In the present study, the pattern of toxicity and early clinical outcome of patients with localized prostate cancer was analyzed.  Methods:   A cohort of 90 patients treated on pelvic lymph nodes from 2010 to 2015 was selected. All patients were treated with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), and Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) in 28 fractions; the prostate, the seminal vesicle and the pelvic lymph node received total doses of 74.2, 65.5, and 51.8 Gy, respectively. End points were the detection of acute and late toxicities graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria CTCAE version 3, evaluating the rectal, genito-urinary and gastro-intestinal toxicity. Correlation of OARs dose parameters and related toxicities was explored. Preliminary overall survival and Progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 25 months, no interruptions for treatment-related toxicity were recorded. Univariate analysis among dosimetric data and acute toxicities showed no correlations. Regarding late toxicity: the dose received by a rectal volume of 90 cm3 was found to be significant for toxicity prediction (p = 0.024). PFS was 90.6% and 60.2% at 2 and 4 years, respectively. PFS correlates with age (p = 0.011) and Gleason score (p = 0.011). Stratifying the PSA nadir in quartiles, its value was significant (p = 0.016) in predicting PFS, showing a reduction of PFS of 2 months for each PSA-nadir increase of 0.1 ng/ml.

However, MEIS1 has also shown to be a potential tumor suppressor in some other cancers, such as non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and prostate cancer. Although multiple roles of MEIS1 in cancer development and progression have been identified, there is an urgent demand to discover more functions of this molecule for further therapeutic design.  Methods:   MEIS1 was overexpressed via adenovirus vector in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells. Western blot and real-time qPCR (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) was performed to examine the protein and mRNA levels of MEIS1. Cell proliferation, survival, in vitro migration and invasion were tested by MTT, colony formation, soft-agar, transwell (in vitro invasion/migration) assays, and tumor in vivo growthwas measured on nude mice model. In addition, flow-cytometry analysis was used to detect cell cycle arrest or non-apoptotic cell death of ccRCC cells induced by MEIS1.  Results:   MEIS1 exhibits a decreased expression in ccRCC cell lines than that in non-tumor cell lines. MEIS1 overexpression inhibits ccRCC cells proliferation and induces G1/S arrest concomitant with marked reduction of G1/S transition regulators, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A. Moreover, MEIS1-1 overexpression also induces non-apoptotic cell death of ccRCC cells via decreasing the levels of pro-survival regulators Survivin and BCL-2. Transwell migration assay (TMA) shows that MEIS1 attenuates in vitro invasion and migration of ccRCC cells with down-regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Further, in nude mice model, MEIS1 inhibits the in vivo growth of Caki-1 cells.  Conclusions:   By investigating the role of MEIS1 in ccRCC cells' survival, proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, cell cycle progress, apoptosis and metastasis, in the present work, we propose that MEIS1 may play an important role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) development.""","""['Jie Zhu', 'Liang Cui', 'Axiang Xu', 'Xiaotao Yin', 'Fanglong Li', 'Jiangping Gao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion or migration in human gastric cancer.', 'Study on the mechanism behind lncRNA MEG3 affecting clear cell renal cell carcinoma by regulating miR-7/RASL11B signaling.', 'Knockdown of lncRNA GHET1 inhibits osteosarcoma cells proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT in vitro and in vivo.', 'The emerging role of MEIS1 in cell proliferation and differentiation.', 'Emerging Roles of Meis1 in Cardiac Regeneration, Stem Cells and Cancer.', 'Polymorphisms within DIO2 and GADD45A genes increase the risk of liver disease progression in chronic hepatitis b carriers.', 'A Systematic Pan-Cancer Analysis of MEIS1 in Human Tumors as Prognostic Biomarker and Immunotherapy Target.', 'ERN1 dependent impact of glucose and glutamine deprivations on PBX3, PBXIP1, PAX6, MEIS1, and MEIS2 genes expression in U87 glioma cells.', 'Lung Cancer Gene Regulatory Network of Transcription Factors Related to the Hallmarks of Cancer.', 'Downregulation of MEIS1 mediated by ELFN1-AS1/EZH2/DNMT3a axis promotes tumorigenesis and oxaliplatin resistance in colorectal cancer.']"""

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether the previously observed activity of pyridine compounds pertains also to the prevention and the treatment of metastatic prostate tumors, in a combined chemotherapy with docetaxel.  Methods:   Cancer-preventing activity of 1,4-DMP was studied in the model of prostate tumors spontaneously arising in C57BL/6-Tg (TRAMP)8247Ng/J (TRAMP) mice. The efficacy of the combined chemotherapy, comprising simultaneous use of 1,4-DMP and docetaxel, was evaluated in the orthotopic mouse model of human PC-3M-luc2 prostate cancer. The toxicity of the applied treatment was also determined.  Results:   The development of prostate tumors in TRAMP mice remained unaffected after administration of 1,4-DMP. Similarly, no effect of 1,4-DMP was found on the growth of orthotopically transplanted PC-3M-luc2 tumors. However, when 1,4-DMP was administered along with docetaxel, it enhanced the anticancer activity of the chemotherapy. As a result, in PC-3M-luc2-bearing mice statistically significant inhibition of the tumor growth and lower metastases incidence were observed. The decreased metastatic yield is probably related to the diminished platelet activity observed in mice treated with combined therapeutic regimen. Finally, the combined treatment exhibited lowered side effects accompanying docetaxel administration.

TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was an attractive cancer therapeutic agent due to its minimal toxicity to normal cells and remarkable apoptotic activity in tumor cells. However, most localized cancers including prostate cancer are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, thereby creating a therapeutic challenge of inducing TRAIL sensitivity in cancer cells. Herein the effects of cyproterone acetate, an antiandrogen steroid, on the TRAIL-induced apoptosis of androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cells are reported.  Methods:   Cell apoptosis was assessed by both annexin V/propidium iodide labeling and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage assays. Gene and protein expression changes were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot assays. The effect of cyproterone acetate on gene promoter activity was determined by luciferase reporter assay.  Results:   Cyproterone acetate but not AR antagonist bicalutamide dramatically increased the susceptibility of androgen receptor-negative human prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis but no effects on immortalized human prostate stromal PS30 cells and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. Further investigation of the TRAIL-induced apoptosis pathway revealed that cyproterone acetate exerted its effect by selectively increasing death receptor 5 (DR5) mRNA and protein expression. Cyproterone acetate treatment also increased DR5 gene promoter activity, which could be abolished by mutation of a consensus binding domain of transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) in the DR5 gene promoter. Cyproterone acetate increases CHOP expression in a concentration and time-dependent manner and endoplasmic reticulum stress reducer 4-phenylbutyrate could block cyproterone acetate-induced CHOP and DR5 up-regulation. More importantly, siRNA silencing of CHOP significantly reduced cyproterone acetate-induced DR5 up-regulation and TRAIL sensitivity in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Our study shows a novel effect of cyproterone acetate on apoptosis pathways in prostate cancer cells and raises the possibility that a combination of TRAIL with cyproterone acetate could be a promising strategy for treating castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Linjie Chen', 'Dennis W Wolff', 'Yan Xie', 'Ming-Fong Lin', 'Yaping Tu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Anti-gout agent allopurinol exerts cytotoxicity to human hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells in combination with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.', 'The anti-obesity drug orlistat promotes sensitivity to TRAIL by two different pathways in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells.', 'Baicalein overcomes tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand resistance via two different cell-specific pathways in cancer cells but not in normal cells.', 'Regulation of the human TRAIL gene.', 'Target to apoptosis: a hopeful weapon for prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacological Small Molecules against Prostate Cancer by Enhancing Function of Death Receptor 5.', 'Enhanced inhibition of tumor growth using TRAIL-overexpressing adipose-derived stem cells in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent CPT-11 in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Up-regulated miR-133a orchestrates epithelial-mesenchymal transition of airway epithelial cells.', 'Evaluation of A-ring fused pyridine d-modified androstane derivatives for antiproliferative and aldo-keto reductase 1C3 inhibitory activity.', 'p53: key conductor of all anti-acne therapies.']"""

Images from an MRCAT (Magnetic Resonance for Calculating ATtenuation, Philips, Vantaa, Finland) pCT method were generated as a part of a clinical MR-simulation procedure. Dose calculation accuracy was assessed by comparing the pCT-based calculation with a CT-based calculation. In addition, the degree of geometric accuracy was studied.  Results:   The median relative difference of PTV mean dose between CT and pCT images was within 0.8% for all tumor types. When assessing the tumor site-specific accuracy, the median [range] relative dose differences to the PTV mean were 0.7 [-0.11;1.05]% for the prostate cases, 0.3 [-0.25;0.57]% for the rectal cases, and 0.09 [-0.69;0.25]% for the gynecological cancer cases. System-induced geometric distortion was measured to be less than 1 mm for all PTV volumes and the effect on the PTV median dose was less than 0.1%.

However, the function of Aurora A in autophagy in prostate cancer has not been investigated. Here, we aimed to study the functioning mechanism and autophagy associated signaling pathways of Aurora A in prostate cancer.  Methods:   To investigate the biological function of Aurora A, down-regulation of Aurora A was performed followed by functional testing assays. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of Aurora A in human prostate cancer specimens. CCK8, Transwell, flow cytometric analysis and measurement of tumor formation in nude mice were performed to test the effects of Aurora A down-regulation in vivo and in vitro. Signaling pathway analysis was performed by using Western blot. Autophagy activity was measured by monitoring the expression levels of LC3-II.  Results:   Aurora A overexpression was significantly higher in human prostate cancer specimens than in BPH. Furthermore, Aurora A knockdown inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells by suppressing the Akt pathway, indicating that Akt is a novel Aurora A substrate in prostate cancer. Additionally, Aurora A down-regulation prompts autophagy in prostate cancer cells. Most importantly, Aurora A ablation almost fully abrogates tumorigenesis in nude mice, suggesting that Aurora A is a key oncogenic effector in prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Taken together, our data suggest that Aurora-A plays an important role in the suppression of autophagy by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Akt, which in turn prevents autophagy-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer.""","""['Shiying Zhang', 'Jianye Li', 'Gaobiao Zhou', 'Dawei Mu', 'Jingmin Yan', 'Jizhang Xing', 'Zhiyong Yao', 'Haibo Sheng', 'Di Li', 'Chao Lv', 'Bin Sun', 'Quan Hong', 'Heqing Guo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Biomark""","""['A Vector-Based Short Hairpin RNA Targeting Aurora B Suppresses Human Prostatic Carcinoma Growth.', 'GPCR48/LGR4 promotes tumorigenesis of prostate cancer via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.', 'Endothelial cells promote metastasis of prostate cancer by enhancing autophagy.', 'Blocked autophagy using lysosomotropic agents sensitizes resistant prostate tumor cells to the novel Akt inhibitor AZD5363.', 'Knockdown of autophagy-related protein 6, Beclin-1, decreases cell growth, invasion, and metastasis and has a positive effect on chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity in osteosarcoma cells.', 'Roles of AIM2 Gene and AIM2 Inflammasome in the Pathogenesis and Treatment of Psoriasis.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'The Etiology and Pathophysiology Genesis of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A New Perspective.', 'Molecular and Functional Links between Neurodevelopmental Processes and Treatment-Induced Neuroendocrine Plasticity in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'The role of Aurora-A in human cancers and future therapeutics.']"""

To aid physicians and patients in their decision making, a variety of predictive assays have emerged within the last decade, many of them imaging based. These assays build predictive models for survival analysis to provide personalized risk assessments for the patients. However, there have rarely been any published studies on how the amount of tumor in the positive prostate biopsy affects the predictive power of these imaging based assays. Recently we have proposed a new algorithmic framework for survival analysis employing semi-supervised transductive regression. This approach has improved the predictive power of biopsy based prostate cancer prognostic models.

Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has become a powerful non-invasive diagnostic tool for the detection of prostate cancer. Among mpMRI imaging modalities, diffusion-weighed imaging has shown the most promising results in accurate detection of prostate cancer. Introduced recently, correlated diffusion imaging (CDI) is a new form of diffusion imaging which accounts for the joint correlation of diffusion signal attenuation across multiple gradient pulse strengths and timings to improve the separability of cancerous and healthy tissues. Dual-stage CDI (D-CDI) is a newer generation of CDI where in contrast to CDI that does not capture anatomical information, an additional signal mixing stage between the correlated diffusion signal from the first signal mixing stage (CDI) and an auxiliary diffusion signal is performed to incorporate anatomical context. The core of D-CDI is a signal mixing algorithm that combines diffusion images at different b values to construct a single image. In this paper, we enhance the signal mixing algorithm to optimize the contribution of each single b-value image to maximize the separability of cancerous and healthy tissues. We evaluated the enhanced D-CDI (eD-CDI) using area under the ROC curve for datasets of 17 patient cases with confirmed prostate cancer and the results show that eD-CDI outperforms the original D-CDI as well as T2 weighted images and diffusion-weighed images used in the form of apparent diffusion coefficient maps.""","""['Farzad Khalvati', 'Junjie Zhang', 'Masoom A Haider', 'Alexander Wong']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Correlated diffusion imaging.', 'Quantitative investigative analysis of tumour separability in the prostate gland using ultra-high b-value computed diffusion imaging.', 'Automated prostate cancer detection via comprehensive multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging texture feature models.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'A comparative study of Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion models for differential diagnosis of prostate cancer with in-bore transrectal MR-guided biopsy as a pathological reference.', 'Sparse reconstruction of compressive sensing MRI using cross-domain stochastically fully connected conditional random fields.']"""

Therefore, a registration of preoperative MRI and CT is essential since it could improve the overall precision of the treatment planning, the placement of radioactive sources inside the prostate as well as the visualization of the dose distribution with respect to the tumor. This registration should compensate for prostate deformations due to changes in size and form between the acquisitions of each modality.

In this paper, we propose a novel automated prostate segmentation model with learned features from deep network. Specifically, we first generate a set of prostate proposals in transverse plane via recognizing the position and coarse estimate of the shape of the prostate on the global prostate image and using the deep network to extract highly effective features for the boundary refinement in a finer scale. With consideration of the correlations among different sequential images, we then construct a graph to select the best prostate proposals from proposal set for its use in 3D prostate segmentation.

Patients and methods:   In all, 210 men on AS with Gleason score 3 + 3 prostate cancer received a first MRI and if indicated [Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score ≥3] targeted biopsy (TBx) using MRI-transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) fusion. The MRI was performed 3 months after diagnosis (group A: n = 97), at confirmatory biopsy (group B: n = 39) or at surveillance biopsy after one or more repeat TRUS-guided systematic biopsies (TRUS-Bx) (group C: n = 74). The primary outcome was upgrading to Gleason score ≥3 + 4 prostate cancer based on MRI ± TBx in groups A, B and C. Biopsy outcomes were stratified for the overall PI-RADS score and PSA-D to identify a subgroup of men in whom a biopsy could have been avoided as no Gleason score upgrading was detected.  Results:   In all, 134/210 (64%) men had a positive MRI and 51/210 (24%) men had Gleason score upgrading based on MRI-TBx.

However, the role of FOXK1 in the progression of prostate cancer remains unknown. Thus, the objectives of this study were to detect the expression of FOXK1 in prostate cancer and to examine its role in prostate cancer cells. We found that the expression of FOXK1 at both the mRNA and protein levels was significantly upregulated in human prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, the downregulation of FOXK1 obviously inhibited the cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and attenuated tumor growth in a xenograft model in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of FOXK1 suppressed the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells, and prevented the EMT phenotype through upregulating the expression of E-cadherin, as well as downregulating the expression of N-cadherin in prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, knockdown of FOXK1 efficiently downregulated the expression levels of β-catenin, c-myc, and cyclin D1 in PC-3 cells. Overall, our results demonstrated that knockdown of FOXK1 inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer, at least in part, through suppressing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, these results suggest that FOXK1 may be a potential therapeutic target for human prostate cancer.""","""['Fang Chen', 'Wei Xiong', 'Ke Dou', 'Qing Ran']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Res""","""['Knockdown of FOXK1 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'MiR-646 inhibited cell proliferation and EMT-induced metastasis by targeting FOXK1 in gastric cancer.', 'Oncogene FOXK1 enhances invasion of colorectal carcinoma by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Knockdown of FOXR2 suppresses the tumorigenesis, growth and metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'The Function of FoxK Transcription Factors in Diseases.', 'FOXK1 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and radiation sensitivity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma via the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.', 'JLP/Foxk1/N-cadherin axis fosters a partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition state in epithelial tubular cells.', 'miR-144-3p represses hepatocellular carcinoma progression by affecting cell aerobic glycolysis via FOXK1.', 'TFAP4 promotes the growth of prostate cancer cells by upregulating FOXK1.', 'Regulation of Wnt Signaling by FOX Transcription Factors in Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 81 men with GS 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer diagnosed by transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy underwent multiparametric MRI and RP between 2012 and 2015. Two blinded radiologists assessed multiparametric MR images and assigned PI-RADSv2 assessment categories (categories 1-5) with the use of sector maps, which were compared with regard to the location of the tumor, the GS, and the presence of EPE at RP. Comparisons were performed between groups with the use of chi-square and multivariate analysis. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using ROC curve analysis, and localization was compared using the Fisher exact test.  Results:   A total of 53.1% of men (43/81) had EPE, and 21.0% (17/81) had GS 4 + 3 = 7 prostate cancer after RP, whereas 2.5% of men (2/81) had their tumors downgraded to GS 3 + 3 = 6. No statistically significant difference in patient age, prostate specific antigen level, or clinical stage existed between groups (p > 0.05). PI-RADSv2 assessment categories were significantly higher for GS 4 + 3 = 7 tumors (p = 0.03). PI-RADSv2 showed moderate accuracy for the diagnosis of GS 4 + 3 = 7 tumors (AUC, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.77), with a category of 4 or higher having a sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of 94.1% and 23.4%, respectively. No patient with a PI-RADSv2 category lower than 3 had a GS 4 + 3 = 7 tumor. Accuracy of tumor localization ranged from 86.4% to 92.6%, with 88.2% of errors (15/17) occurring in GS 3 + 3 = 6 or GS 3 + 4 = 7 tumors (p = 0.30). PI-RADSv2 categories were noted to be higher when EPE was present (p < 0.001). Interobserver agreement was moderate (κ = 0.43).  Conclusion:   For GS 3 + 4 = 7 cancers detected at transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy, higher PI-RADSv2 assessment categories are associated with upgrading to GS 4 + 3 = 7 cancer and with the presence of EPE after RP.

Methods:   A total of 476 cases of suspected malignancy of different sites and different histological subtypes were studied. TIC was obtained in all the biopsies and the cytological findings were correlated with the corresponding biopsy diagnosis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy.  Results:   TIC was satisfactory for evaluation with respect to the cellularity and cell morphology in 468 (98.3%) cases.

Objective:   We aimed to describe our experience with transperineal repair and unilateral gracilis muscle interposition in patients with rectourethral fistula after radical prostatectomy in nonradiated prostate cancer.  Design:   This was a cohort study.  Settings:   All of the procedures were performed at the same hospital by the same multidisciplinary team made up of a senior colorectal surgeon and a senior urologist.  Patients:   Patients with postoperative rectourethral fistula after laparoscopic prostatectomy were included.  Intervention:   Transperineal fistula repair and gracilis muscle interposition were included.  Main outcome measures:   Fistula healing rate was measured.  Results:   Nine patients with postoperative rectourethral fistula were treated between November 2009 and February 2016. Four of them had received other previous treatments without success, and 5 had previously been treated with this technique. Seven patients had a fecal diverting stoma. After a median follow-up of 54 months (range, 2-72), all of the fistulas had successfully healed, and, to date, the patients remain asymptomatic without urinary diversion. Fecal diversion was closed in all but 1 patient. No intraoperative or infectious complications were detected. With the results of our series, we present specific technical details of our technique and hope to provide additional evidence of the low morbidity profile and excellent healing rate of this treatment. Moreover, we note that, although small, this series corresponds with a homogeneous group of patients with rectourethral fistula after radical prostatectomy in nonradiated prostate cancer.

The computer-aided diagnosis device for BSI analysis EXINIboneBSI seems to represent technical progress for the quantitative assessment of bone involvement. But it is not yet clear if the automated BSI (aBSI) could contribute to improved evaluation of progression in patients under antiandrogens or chemotherapy in contrast to the visual interpretation and/or conventional biomarkers such as the prostate-specific antigen (PSA).  Methods:   In 49 mPCa patients, bone scans were performed initially and during different therapy courses. Scans were evaluated visually and by the artificial-neural-network-based expert system EXINIboneBSI. Progression of metastatic bone involvement was defined according to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria in the visual interpretation. The computer-assisted interpretation was based on different cutoff values in relative changes of the aBSI. Additionally, assessments according to bone scanning were compared to changes in the PSA value as a potential surrogate for treatment response.  Results:   Using a sensitive cutoff value (5% or 10%) for the relative aBSI increase led to significantly increased progression determination compared to the visual interpretation of bone scans (49% and 43% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). In 63% of the cases PSA and BSI changes matched, whereas in 18% progression was only indicated by the aBSI. A relative cutoff of 5% for the aBSI decrease could reclassify 47 serial scan pairs which were visually interpreted as stable into 22 progressive and 25 remissive scans.  Conclusion:   Distinct thresholds of the relative aBSI could help to better assess disease progression in mPCa patients. Manual corrections of the BSI values are not required in most cases. The aBSI could serve as a useful additional parameter for therapy monitoring in mPCa patients in the future.""","""['Fabian Haupt', 'Georg Berding', 'Ali Namazian', 'Florian Wilke', 'Alena Böker', 'Axel Merseburger', 'Lilli Geworski', 'Markus Antonius Kuczyk', 'Frank Michael Bengel', 'Inga Peters']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Adv Ther""","""['Measuring the unmeasurable: automated bone scan index as a quantitative endpoint in prostate cancer clinical trials.', 'Prediction of survival benefit using an automated bone scan index in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A new parameter for measuring metastatic bone involvement by prostate cancer: the Bone Scan Index.', 'Analytic Validation of the Automated Bone Scan Index as an Imaging Biomarker to Standardize Quantitative Changes in Bone Scans of Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Scoring systems of quantitative bone scanning in prostate cancer: historical overview, current status and future perspectives.', 'Application of SPECT and PET / CT with computer-aided diagnosis in bone metastasis of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Prognosis of patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis from the Japanese Prostatic Cancer Registry of Standard Hormonal and Chemotherapy Using Bone Scan Index cohort study.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Clinical Decision Support: a Focused Literature Survey.', 'Measuring the unmeasurable: automated bone scan index as a quantitative endpoint in prostate cancer clinical trials.']"""

Methods:   Pooled analyses were conducted of 19 prospective population-based cohorts included in the Asia Cohort Consortium, comprising data from 658,611 East Asians and 112,686 South Asians. HRs were used to compare individuals with diabetes at baseline with those without diabetes for the risk of death from any cancer and from site-specific cancers, including cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, colon, rectum, liver, bile duct, pancreas, lung, breast, endometrium, cervix, ovary, prostate, bladder, kidney and thyroid, as well as lymphoma and leukaemia.  Results:   During a mean follow-up of 12.7 years, 37,343 cancer deaths (36,667 in East Asians and 676 in South Asians) were identified. Baseline diabetes status was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of death from any cancer (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.21, 1.31).

Here, we purified recombinant human SPCA1a from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and measured Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity following reconstitution in proteoliposomes. The purified SPCA1a displays a higher apparent Ca2+ affinity and a lower maximal turnover rate than the purified sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a). The lipids cholesteryl hemisuccinate, linoleamide/oleamide, and phosphatidylethanolamine inhibit and phosphatidic acid and sphingomyelin enhance SPCA1a activity. Moreover, SPCA1a is blocked by micromolar concentrations of the commonly used SERCA1a inhibitors thapsigargin (Tg), cyclopiazonic acid, and 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone. Because tissue-specific targeting of SERCA2b by Tg analogues is considered for prostate cancer therapy, the inhibition of SPCA1a by Tg might represent an off-target risk. We assessed the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of Tg for SPCA1a by in silico modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and measuring the potency of a series of Tg analogues. These indicate that Tg and the analogues are bound via the Tg scaffold but with lower affinity to the same homologous cavity as on the membrane surface of SERCA1a. The lower Tg affinity may depend on a more flexible binding cavity in SPCA1a, with low contributions of the Tg O-3, O-8, and O-10 chains to the binding energy. Conversely, the protein interaction of the Tg O-2 side chain with SPCA1a appears comparable with that of SERCA1a. These differences define a SAR of Tg for SPCA1a distinct from that of SERCA1a, indicating that Tg analogues with a higher specificity for SPCA1a can probably be developed.""","""['Jialin Chen', 'Joren De Raeymaecker', 'Jannik Brøndsted Hovgaard', 'Susanne Smaardijk', 'Ilse Vandecaetsbeek', 'Frank Wuytack', 'Jesper Vuust Møller', 'Jan Eggermont', 'Marc De Maeyer', 'Søren Brøgger Christensen', 'Peter Vangheluwe']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['An N-terminal Ca2+-binding motif regulates the secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-transport ATPase SPCA1.', 'Thapsigargin affinity purification of intracellular P(2A)-type Ca(2+) ATPases.', 'Effects of high-affinity inhibitors on partial reactions, charge movements, and conformational States of the Ca2+ transport ATPase (sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase).', 'The Ca2+ pumps of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.', 'Targeting thapsigargin towards tumors.', 'Structure and transport mechanism of the human calcium pump SPCA1.', 'ATP hydrolytic activity of purified Spf1p correlate with micellar lipid fluidity and is dependent on conserved residues in transmembrane helix M1.', 'A Review on Mechanistic Insight of Plant Derived Anticancer Bioactive Phytocompounds and Their Structure Activity Relationship.', 'From Plant to Patient: Thapsigargin, a Tool for Understanding Natural Product Chemistry, Total Syntheses, Biosynthesis, Taxonomy, ATPases, Cell Death, and Drug Development.', 'Two Undervalued Functions of the Golgi Apparatus: Removal of Excess Ca2+ and Biosynthesis of Farnesol-Like Sesquiterpenoids, Possibly as Ca2+-Pump Agonists and Membrane ""Fluidizers-Plasticizers"".']"""

Recently, sub-populations of prostate cancer cells have been identified with stem cell features and are associated with the emergence of treatment-resistant prostate cancer. Here, we explored the function of AR in prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) relative to growth and stem cell-associated characteristics. CAFs were isolated from the murine cPten-/-L prostate cancer model and cultured with human prostate cancer epithelial (hPCa) cells. A murine-specific AR antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) was used to suppress the expression of AR in the CAF cells. CAFs express low, but significant levels of AR relative to fibroblasts derived from non-malignant tissue. CAFs promoted growth and colony formation of hPCa cells, which was attenuated by the suppression of AR expression. Surprisingly, AR-depleted CAFs promoted increased stem cell marker expression in hPCa cells. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) were increased in AR-depleted CAF cells and exhibited similar effects on stem cell marker expression as seen in the CAF co-culture systems. Clinically, elevated IFN-γ expression was found to correlate with histologic grade in primary prostate cancer samples. In summary, AR and androgen-dependent signaling are active in CAFs and exert significant effects on prostate cancer cells. IFN-γ and M-CSF are AR-regulated factors secreted by CAF cells, which promote the expression of stem cell markers in prostate cancer epithelial cells. Understanding how CAFs and other constituents of stromal tissue react to anti-cancer therapies may provide insight into the development and progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Chun-Peng Liao', 'Leng-Ying Chen', 'Andrea Luethy', 'Youngsoo Kim', 'Kian Kani', 'A Robert MacLeod', 'Mitchell E Gross']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Loss of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promotes CCL2- and CXCL8-mediated cancer cell migration.', 'Androgen receptor in human prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts promotes prostate cancer epithelial cell growth and invasion.', 'LMO2 upregulation due to AR deactivation in cancer-associated fibroblasts induces non-cell-autonomous growth of prostate cancer after androgen deprivation.', 'Differential androgen receptor signals in different cells explain why androgen-deprivation therapy of prostate cancer fails.', 'Metabolic Relationship between Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts and Cancer Cells.', 'New Perspectives on Sex Steroid Hormones Signaling in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'New Insights and Emerging Therapeutic Approaches in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Cancer-Associated Fibroblast as a Dynamic Player in Mediating Cancer Stemness in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'The Role of Androgen Receptor in Cross Talk Between Stromal Cells and Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.', 'Messing Up the Cancer Stem Cell Chemoresistance Mechanisms Supported by Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Behavioral pain interventions are a recommended part of multimodal pain treatments, but they are underused in clinical care due to barriers such as a lack of the resources needed to deliver them in person and difficulties coordinating their use with clinical care. Pain coping skills training (PCST) is an evidence-based behavioral pain intervention traditionally delivered in person. Delivering this training via the web would increase access to it by addressing barriers that currently limit its use. We conducted a patient pilot study of an 8-week web-based PCST program to determine the acceptability of this approach to patients and the program features needed to meet their needs. Focus groups with healthcare providers identified strategies for coordinating the use of web-based PCST in clinical care.  Method:   Participants included 7 adults with bone pain due to multiple myeloma or metastasized breast or prostate cancer and 12 healthcare providers (4 physicians and 8 advanced practice providers) who treat cancer-related bone pain. Patients completed web-based PCST at home and then took part in an in-depth qualitative interview. Providers attended focus groups led by a trained moderator. Qualitative analyses identified themes in the patient and provider data.  Results:   Patients reported strongly favorable responses to web-based PCST and described emotional and physical benefits. They offered suggestions for adapting the approach to better fit their needs and to overcome barriers to completion. Focus groups indicated a need to familiarize healthcare providers with PCST and to address concerns about overburdening patients. Providers would recommend the program to patients they felt could benefit. They suggested applying a broad definition of cancer pain and having various types of providers help coordinate program its use with clinical care.  Significance of results:   Web-based PCST was acceptable to patients and providers. Our findings suggest that patients could benefit from this approach, especially if patient and provider barriers are addressed.""","""['Christine Rini', 'Maihan B Vu', 'Hannah Lerner', 'Catherine Bloom', 'Jessica Carda-Auten', 'William A Wood', 'Ethan M Basch', 'Peter M Voorhees', 'Katherine E Reeder-Hayes', 'Francis J Keefe']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Palliat Support Care""","""['A behavioral cancer pain intervention: A randomized noninferiority trial comparing in-person with videoconference delivery.', 'Physical Therapist-Delivered Pain Coping Skills Training and Exercise for Knee Osteoarthritis: Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Optimizing delivery of a behavioral pain intervention in cancer patients using a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial SMART.', 'Telehealth Services Designed for Women: An Evidence Map Internet.', 'Web based survivorship interventions for women with breast cancer: An integrative review.', 'Improving well-being for individuals with persistent pain after surgery for breast cancer, lobular carcinoma in situ, or ductal carcinoma in situ: A randomized clinical trial.', 'Attitudes of Nurses Towards Searching Online for Medical Information for Personal Health Needs: Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study.', '""I Could Do It in My Own Time and When I Really Needed It"": Perceptions of Online Pain Coping Skills Training For People With Knee Osteoarthritis.']"""

The Prostate cancer: Evidence of Exercise and Nutrition Trial (PrEvENT) aimed to assess a diet and physical activity intervention in men undergoing radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. The trial included a qualitative component to explore the experiences of men participating in the trial in order to understand the acceptability of the intervention and data collection methods. We report the qualitative findings of the trial and consider how these can be used to inform future research.  Methods:   PrEvENT involved randomizing men to either a dietary and/or physical activity intervention. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 17 men on completion of the 6 month trial. Interviews took place in clinic or as telephone interviews, if requested by the participant, and were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using the thematic-based framework approach. Analysis was conducted throughout the data collection process to allow emergent themes to be further explored in subsequent interviews.  Results:   Three overarching themes were identified: acceptability of the intervention, acceptability of the data collection methods and trial logistics. Participants were predominantly positive about both the dietary and physical activity interventions and most men found the methods of data collection appropriate. Recommendations for future trials include consideration of alternative physical activity options, such as cycling or gym sessions, increased information on portion sizes, the potential importance of including wives or partners in the dietary change process and the possibility of using the pedometer or other wearable technology as part of the physical activity intervention.  Conclusions:   We provide insight into the opinions and experiences of the acceptability of the PrEvENT diet and physical activity intervention from the participants themselves. The interventions delivered were acceptable to this sample of participants, as were the data collection methods utilized. We also highlight some considerations for further behavioural change interventions in prostate cancer and other similar populations.  Trial registration:   ISRCTN, ISRCTN99048944 .

Whether such referrals are feasible remains unanswered.  Methods:   Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data, SEER 18, and US Incidence data were used to determine the geographic distribution and radical prostatectomy volume for providers. Access was defined as availability of a high-volume provider within driving distance of 100 miles. The opportunity cost was defined as the value of benefits achievable by performing the surgery by a high-volume provider that was forgone by not making a referral. The savings per referral were derived from a published Markov model for radical prostatectomy.  Results:   A total of 14% of providers performed>27% of the radical prostatectomies with>30 cases per year and were designated high-volume providers. Providers with below-median volume (≤16 prostatectomies per year) performed>32% of radical prostatectomies. At least 47% of these were within a 100-mile driving distance (median = 22 miles), and therefore had access to a high-volume provider (>30 prostatectomies per year). This translated into a discounted savings of more than $24 million per year, representing the opportunity cost of not making a referral. The average volume for high- and low-volume providers was 55 and 13, respectively, resulting in an annual experience gap of 43 and a cumulative gap of 125 surgeries over 3 years. In 2014, the number of surgeons performing radical prostatectomy decreased by 5% while the number of high- and low-volume providers decreased by 25% and 11% showing a faster decline in the number of high-volume providers compared with low-volume surgeons.  Conclusions:   About half of prostatectomies performed by surgeons with below-median annual volume were within a 100-mile driving distance (median of 22 miles) of a high-volume surgeon.

Methods:   From Jul 2014 to Aug 2016, data on 1144 patients who had undergone the initial prostate biopsies were prospectively collected and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictors for PCa and HPPCa. Based on independent predictors, nomogram models were developed and internally validated to assess a man's risk of harboring PCa and HPPCa.  Results:   The detection rates of PCa and HPPCa were 43.09% (493/1144) and 39.16% (448/1144), respectively. In the multivariate analyses, age, PSA, TZV, DRE, and TRUS instead of PV or PVI were independent predictors for PCa and HPPCa, percent free PSA was independent predictor for PCa not for HPPCa. Such independent predictors were finally included in the nomogram models. The AUCs of TZV-based nomogram models were 87.0% for PCa and 87.7% for HPPCa, which were higher than that of PSA alone or other predictive models.

However, for blood-based strategies to be useful, the quantity of biomarker shed into the blood and its relationship to tumor growth or progression must be validated. To study how blood biomarker levels correlate with early-stage viable tumor growth in a mouse model of human cancer, we monitored early tumor growth of engineered human ovarian cancer cells (A2780) implanted orthotopically into nude mice. Biomarker shedding was monitored by serial blood sampling, whereas tumor viability and volume were monitored by bioluminescence imaging and ultrasound imaging. From these metrics, we developed a mathematical model of cancer biomarker kinetics that accounts for biomarker shedding from tumor and healthy cells, biomarker entry into vasculature, biomarker elimination from plasma, and subject-specific tumor growth. We validated the model in a separate set of mice in which subject-specific tumor growth rates were accurately predicted. To illustrate clinical translation of this strategy, we allometrically scaled model parameters from mouse to human and used parameters for PSA shedding and prostate cancer. In this manner, we found that blood biomarker sampling data alone were capable of enabling the detection and discrimination of simulated aggressive (2-month tumor doubling time) and nonaggressive (18-month tumor doubling time) tumors as early as 7.2 months and 8.9 years before clinical imaging, respectively. Our model and screening strategy offers broad impact in their applicability to any solid cancer and associated biomarkers shed, thereby allowing a distinction between aggressive and nonaggressive tumors using blood biomarker sampling data alone.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 68 patients with symptomatic urethral diverticula (UD) with at least 1 year of follow-up data following transvaginal urethral diverticulectomy conducted by a single surgeon. The presence of UD was confirmed by a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). According to MRI findings, the UDs were classified as simple, U-shaped, or circumferential. Cure was defined as the absence of residual diverticulum on a postoperative MRI with a resolution of symptoms.  Results:   There were 27 cases (39.7%) of simple, 16 cases (23.5%) of U-shaped, and 25 cases (36.8%) of circumferential diverticula. The initial cure rate for UD was 77.9%. According to configuration, the cure rates for simple, U-shaped, and circumferential diverticula were 100%, 75.0%, and 64.0%, respectively (P = .043). Of the 15 patients with UD recurrence, 4 did not require reoperation because of symptom resolution. Of the 11 cases that underwent a second operation, 8 patients were cured: 7 via a Martius labial fat pad interposition (MLFI) procedure and 1 via simple excision without MLFI. The overall cure rate was 92.6%. The circumferential configuration was an independent factor for a lower cure rate (odds ratio, 7.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-55.69).  Conclusion:   Transvaginal diverticulectomy is an effective treatment for female UD. The success rate of an initial surgery was significantly lower for UDs with circumferential configurations than for simple or U-shaped UDs. Regardless of the initial configuration, MLFI is a good treatment option for recurrent or persistent diverticula.""","""['Kwang Jin Ko', 'Yoon Seok Suh', 'Tae Heon Kim', 'Hyo Serk Lee', 'Won Jin Cho', 'Deok Hyun Han', 'Kyu-Sung Lee']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urology""","""['The Modified Prone Jack-knife Position for the Excision of Female Urethral Diverticula.', 'Outcomes of surgery of female urethral diverticula classified using magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Management of symptomatic urethral diverticula in women: a single-centre experience.', 'Surgical management of urethral diverticula in women: a systematic review.', 'Female urethral diverticulum.

The need to base attenuation correction on MRI instead of CT has arisen with the introduction of integrated PET/MRI systems. The aim was to describe the effect of residual gradient field nonlinearity distortions on PET attenuation correction.  Methods:   MRI distortions caused by gradient field nonlinearity were simulated in CT images used for attenuation correction in PET reconstructions. The simulations yielded radial distortion of up to ±2.3mm at 15cm from the scanner isocentre for distortion corrected images. The mean radial distortion of uncorrected images were 6.3mm at the same distance. Reconstructions of PET data were performed using the distortion corrected images as well as the images where no correction had been applied.  Results:   The mean relative difference in reconstructed PET uptake intensity due to incomplete distortion correction was less than ±5%. The magnitude of this difference varied between patients and the size of the distortions remaining after distortion correction.  Conclusions:   Radial distortions of 2mm at 15cm radius from the scanner isocentre lead to PET attenuation correction errors smaller than 5%. Keeping the gradient field nonlinearity distortions below this limit can be a reasonable goal for MRI systems used for attenuation correction in PET for quantification purposes. A higher geometrical accuracy may, however, be warranted for quantification of peripheral lesions. These distortions can, e.g., be controlled at acceptance testing and subsequent quality assurance intervals.""","""['Josef A Lundman', 'Adam Johansson', 'Jörgen Olofsson', 'Jan Axelsson', 'Anne Larsson', 'Tufve Nyholm']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Impact of time-of-flight PET on quantification errors in MR imaging-based attenuation correction.', 'Evaluation of a direct motion estimation/correction method in respiratory-gated PET/MRI with motion-adjusted attenuation.', 'Improved volumetric measurement of brain structure with a distortion correction procedure using an ADNI phantom.', 'Vision 20/20: Magnetic resonance imaging-guided attenuation correction in PET/MRI: Challenges, solutions, and opportunities.', 'Metal artifact correction strategies in MRI-based attenuation correction in PET/MRI.']"""

Custirsen is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits clusterin production. The aim of the SYNERGY trial was to investigate the effect of custirsen in combination with docetaxel and prednisone on overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   SYNERGY was a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised trial set at 134 study centres in 12 countries. Patients were eligible for participation if they had: metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and had received no previous chemotherapy; prostate-specific antigen greater than 5 ng/mL; and a Karnofsky performance score of 70% or higher. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 centrally to either the docetaxel, prednisone, and custirsen combination or docetaxel and prednisone alone. Patients were not masked to treatment allocation. Randomisation was stratified by opioid use for cancer-related pain and radiographic evidence of progression. All patients received docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously with 5 mg of prednisone orally twice daily. Patients assigned docetaxel, prednisone, and custirsen received weekly doses of custirsen 640 mg intravenously after three loading doses of 640 mg. The primary endpoint was overall survival analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Patients who received at least one study dose were included in the safety analysis set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01188187. The trial is completed and final analyses are reported here.  Findings:   Between Dec 10, 2010, and Nov 7, 2012, 1022 patients were enrolled to the trial, of whom 510 were assigned docetaxel, prednisone, and custirsen and 512 were allocated docetaxel and prednisone. No difference in overall survival was recorded between the two groups (median survival 23·4 months [95% CI 20·9-24·8] with docetaxel, prednisone, and custirsen vs 22·0 months [19·5-24·0] with docetaxel and prednisone; hazard ratio [HR] 0·93, 95% CI 0·79-1·10; p=0·415). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or worse in the docetaxel, prednisone and custirsen group (n=501) compared with the docetaxel and prednisone alone group (n=499) were neutropenia (grade 3, 63 [13%] vs 28 [6%]; grade 4, 98 [20%] vs 77 [15%]), febrile neutropenia (grade 3, 52 [10%] vs 31 [6%]; grade 4, four [1%] vs two [<1%]), and fatigue (grade 3, 53 [11%] vs 41 [8%]; grade 4, three [1%] vs one [<1%]). One or more serious adverse events were reported for 214 (43%) of 501 patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone, and custirsen and 181 (36%) of 499 receiving docetaxel and prednisone alone. Adverse events were attributable to 23 (5%) deaths in the docetaxel, prednisone, and custirsen group and 24 (5%) deaths in the docetaxel and prednisone alone group.  Interpretation:   Addition of custirsen to first-line docetaxel and prednisone was reasonably well tolerated, but overall survival was not significantly longer for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with this combination, compared with patients treated with docetaxel and prednisone alone.

This study used intragastric administration of astaxanthin to detect its role on tumor proliferation, apoptosis, microRNA (miRNA) overexpression, and microbacteria composition change by establishing androgen-independent PCa cell PC-3 xenograft nude mice. Nude mice were inoculated with androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells subcutaneously. The intervention was started when tumors reached 0.5-0.6 cm in diameter. Mice were intragastrically administered 100 mg/kg astaxanthin (HA), 25 mg/kg astaxanthin (LA), or olive oil (TC). The results showed that 100 mg/kg astaxanthin significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to the TC group, with an inhibitory rate of 41.7%. A decrease of Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as well as an increase of cleaved caspase-3 were observed in HA-treated tumors, along with increasing apoptotic cells, obtained by TUNEL assay. The HA significantly elevated the levels of tumor suppressors miR-375 and miR-487b in tumor tissues and the amount of Lactobacillus sp. and Lachnospiraceae in mice stools, while there was no significant difference between LA and TC groups.

Materials and methods:   Patients with CRPC who had progressed on AA therapy received escalating doses of either buparlisib or dactolisib, along with fixed doses of AA (1000 mg once daily (qd)) and prednisone (5 mg twice daily (bid)). The primary objective was to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of either buparlisib or dactolisib in combination with AA. Secondary objectives included safety, antitumour activity (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria; 30% of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline at ≥week 12) and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile.  Results:   In buparlisib + AA arm, 25 patients received buparlisib + AA (median age, 67 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0/1/2 for 7/17/1 patients, respectively). At 100 mg qd; two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) (grade 3 hyperglycaemia; grade 2 asthenia), and this was the maximum buparlisib dose explored. Buparlisib + AA showed a 26% lower median area under the curve from time zero to 24°h (AUC0-24) and 48% lower median maximum serum concentration (Cmax) versus the single-agent buparlisib assessed in first-in-human study. No objective response and few PSA decreases were reported. In dactolisib + AA arm, 18 patients (median age, 71 years; ECOG PS of 0/1 for 6/12 patients, respectively) received dactolisib + AA at the first dose level (200 mg bid).

Deregulation of ADAM15 has been linked to tumor aggressiveness and cell line studies suggest that ADAM15 overexpression may also be implicated in prostate cancer. To evaluate the impact of ADAM15 expression and its relationship with key genomic alterations, a tissue microarray containing 12,427 prostate cancers was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. ADAM15 expression was compared to phenotype, prognosis and molecular features including TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and frequent deletions involving PTEN, 3p, 5q and 6q. Normal prostate epithelium did not show ADAM15 staining. In prostate cancers, negative, weak, moderate, and strong ADAM15 staining was found in 87.7%, 3.7%, 5.6%, and 3.0% of 9826 interpretable tumors. Strong ADAM15 staining was linked to high Gleason grade, advanced pathological tumor stage, positive nodal stage and resection margin. ADAM15 overexpression was also associated with TMPRSS2:ERG fusions and PTEN deletions (P<.0001) but unrelated to deletions of 3p, 5q and 6q. In univariate analysis, high ADAM15 expression was strongly linked to PSA recurrence (P<.0001). However, in multivariate analyses this association was only maintained if the analysis was limited to preoperatively available parameters in ERG-negative cancers. The results of our study demonstrate that ADAM15 is strongly up regulated in a small but highly aggressive fraction of prostate cancers. In these tumors, ADAM15 may represent a suitable drug target. In a preoperative scenario, ADAM15 expression measurement may assist prognosis assessment, either alone or in combination with other markers.""","""['Christoph Burdelski', 'Michael Fitzner', 'Claudia Hube-Magg', 'Martina Kluth', 'Asmus Heumann', 'Ronald Simon', 'Till Krech', 'Till Clauditz', 'Franziska Büscheck', 'Stefan Steurer', 'Corinna Wittmer', 'Andrea Hinsch', 'Andreas M Luebke', 'Frank Jacobsen', 'Sarah Minner', 'Maria Christina Tsourlakis', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Imke Thederan', 'Guido Sauter', 'Jakob Izbicki', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Waldemar Wilczak']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['The prognostic value of SUMO1/Sentrin specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) in prostate cancer is limited to ERG-fusion positive tumors lacking PTEN deletion.', 'βIII-tubulin overexpression is an independent predictor of prostate cancer progression tightly linked to ERG fusion status and PTEN deletion.', 'High-Level γ-Glutamyl-Hydrolase (GGH) Expression is Linked to Poor Prognosis in ERG Negative Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of the disintegrin metalloproteinase ADAM15 in prostate cancer progression.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.', 'Consistent DNA Hypomethylations in Prostate Cancer.', 'A Small Peptide Targeting the Ligand-Induced Androgen Receptor/Filamin a Interaction Inhibits the Invasive Phenotype of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Extracellular Matrix Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer.', 'N-cadherin in osteolineage cells modulates stromal support of tumor growth.', 'The Role of the Metzincin Superfamily in Prostate Cancer Progression: A Systematic-Like Review.']"""

On the assumption that the patient setup error was already accounted for by image guidance, only organ deformation over the treatment course was considered. Once the clinical target volume (CTV), rectum, and bladder were delineated and assigned dose constraints for dose optimization, each voxel in the CTV derived from the DICOM RT-dose grid could have a stochastic dose from the different voxel location according to the probability density function as an organ deformation. The stochastic dose for the CTV was calculated as the mean dose at the location through changing the voxel location randomly 1000 times. In the EE approach, the underdose region in the CTV was delineated and optimized with higher dose constraints that resulted in an edge-enhanced intensity beam to the CTV. This was compared to a planning target volume (PTV) margin (PM) approach in which a CTV to PTV margin equivalent to the magnitude of organ deformation was added to obtain an optimized dose distribution. The total monitor units, number of segments, and conformity index were compared between the two approaches, and the dose based on the organ deformation of the CTV, rectum, and bladder was evaluated. The total monitor units, number of segments, and conformity index were significantly lower with the EE approach than with the PM approach, while maintaining the dose coverage to the CTV with organ deformation.

Few studies consider longer-term impact of disease progression and treatment adverse effects on health-related quality of life (QoL) of these men.  Objective:   Describe changes in health-related QoL over 5 years for men with newly diagnosed locally advanced or advanced prostate cancer.  Interventions/methods:   Eighty-one men with locally advanced or advanced prostate cancer referred to the study by their treating urologist completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing distress, cancer-specific distress, decision regret, satisfaction with life, and global and disease-specific health-related QoL. Questionnaires were administered close to diagnosis (baseline), 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months' follow-up.  Results:   Men were of mean age 68.3 (SD, 7.9) years and at mean of 31.9 (SD, 50.5) days postdiagnosis. The most common treatment received was androgen deprivation therapy (95.1%) or radiation therapy (79%). The proportion of men classified as distressed (Distress Thermometer) ranged from 46.3% (baseline) to 32.6% (60 months). Decrements in physical QoL were found at 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months compared with baseline. Life satisfaction ratings were lower at 6 months compared with baseline. Sexual concerns were consistently high across the 5 years (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite <30).  Conclusions:   In the context of advanced disease, results indicate that health-related QoL fluctuates from diagnosis to 5 years later.

Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been reported as a potential technique to provide surgeons with real-time intraoperative margin assessment. In addition to providing a quantified measure of margin status, a co-registered electrical impedance tomography (EIT) image presented on a surgeon's workstation could add value to the margin assessment process.  Approach:   To investigate this, we conducted a comparative study between EIS and EIT to evaluate the potential these technologies might have for margin assessment. EIS and EIT data was acquired from ex vivo human prostates using a multi-electrode endoscopic impedance acquisition probe.  Main results:   EIS and EIT show good predictive performance with a 0.76 and 0.80 area-under-curve (AUC), respectively, when considering discrete frequencies only. A machine learning (ML) algorithm is implemented to combine features, which improves the AUCs of EIS and EIT to 0.84 and 0.85, respectively. Single-step EIT takes significantly less time to reconstruct than multi-step EIT, yet provides similarly accurate classification results, making the single-step approach a potential candidate for real-time margin assessment. While the ML-based approach clearly exhibits benefits as compared to the single feature assessment, the decision to use EIS versus EIT is unclear since each approach performs better for different subsets of tissue classifications.  Significance:   The results presented in this paper corroborate our previous studies and present the strongest evidence yet that an intraoperative-capable impedance probe can be used to distinguish benign from malignant prostate tissues. An in vivo study with a large cohort will be necessary to definitively determine the preferred approach and to show the clinical effectiveness of using this technology for margin assessment.""","""['Ethan K Murphy', 'Aditya Mahara', 'Shadab Khan', 'Elias S Hyams', 'Alan R Schned', 'Jason Pettus', 'Ryan J Halter']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Physiol Meas""","""['Electrical property sensing biopsy needle for prostate cancer detection.', 'Toward microendoscopic electrical impedance tomography for intraoperative surgical margin assessment.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection Using Composite Impedance Metric.', 'Reconstruction technology of electrical impedance tomography.', 'A review of electrical impedance techniques for breast cancer detection.', 'Classification between Normal and Cancerous Human Urothelial Cells by Using Micro-Dimensional Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Combined with Machine Learning.', 'Tissue Recognition Based on Electrical Impedance Classified by Support Vector Machine in Spinal Operation Area.', 'Non-destructive monitoring of 3D cell cultures: new technologies and applications.', 'Label-Free Physical Techniques and Methodologies for Proteins Detection in Microfluidic Biosensor Structures.', 'Machine Learning Enhances the Performance of Bioreceptor-Free Biosensors.']"""

Lower Gleason (G) grade at diagnosis due to RAPC has been previously reported but grade at prostatectomy has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of RAPC on the outcomes of patients with G7 disease on radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was carried out of all RPs performed over a 9-year period (2006-2014). Outcomes for G7 prostatectomies were compared before and after the introduction of the RAPC, with a further sub-analysis of G4 + 3 versus G3 + 4. The primary outcome was biochemical recurrence (BCR). Other outcomes were adjuvant/salvage radiotherapy, extra prostatic extension, positive surgical margins, seminal vesicle involvement and tumour stage.  Results:   In total, 240 RPs were performed with 167 cases graded G7 (70 graded G4 + 3 and 97 graded G3 + 4). Since the introduction of RAPC the proportion of G4 + 3 compared to G3 + 4 has increased from 37.9 to 42%. There was no statistical difference in outcomes for G4 + 3 treated before and after the introduction of RAPC. G4 + 3 was associated with higher rates of BCR (24.4 vs. 0%, p < 0.0001, radiotherapy (41.1 vs. 4.8%, p < 0.0001) and worse histological features than G3 + 4.

In this study we analyzed the adherence of urologists in private practice from the administrative district of Münster, Germany to this guideline.  Methods:   Data were collected through a semistructured survey of 22 urologists based on the COREQ checklist (Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research) in four focus groups consisting of five or six urologists in private practice. We developed 23 questions relating to 12 recommendations of the paragraphs of the S3 guidelines dealing with early detection of prostate cancer and prostate biopsy. The recommendations of the guideline are subdivided in nine ""strong"", one ""optional recommendation"" and two ""statements"". The adherence to the guideline was investigated by using frequency and qualitative content analysis (Mayring) based on a mixed methods design.  Results:   The urologists follow six of the nine ""strong recommendations"" of the guideline and deviate from three. Reasons for deviations from ""strong recommendations"" are the following: information about advantages and disadvantages of early detection for prostate cancer, recommendation of a prostate biopsy in case of PSA level ≥4 ng/ml, and indication for repeat biopsy.  Conclusion:   Most of the ""strong recommendations"" are followed by the interviewed urologists of the administrative district of Münster.

Methods:   240 patients who underwent a [68Ga]PSMA I&T PET/CT in the context of biochemical relapse of prostate cancer were included in this retrospective analysis. Imaging consisted of a standard whole-body PET/CT (1 h p.i.), followed by delayed (3 h p.i.) imaging of the abdomen. PSA-stratified proportions of positive PET/CT results, standardized uptake values and target-to-background ratios were analyzed, and compared between standard and delayed imaging.  Results:   The overall detection rates of [68Ga]PSMA I&T PET/CT were 94.2, 71.8, 58.6, 55.9 and 38.9% for PSA levels of ≥2, 1 to <2, 0.5 to <1, >0.2 to <0.5, and 0.01 to 0.2 ng/mL, respectively. Although the target-to-background ratio improved significantly over time (P < 0.0001), the majority (96.6%) of all lesions suggestive of recurrent disease could already be detected in standard imaging. Delayed imaging at 3 h p.i. exclusively identified pathologic findings in 5.4% (10/184) of abnormal [68Ga]PSMA I&T PET/CT scans, and exclusively detected 3.4% (38/1134) of all lesions suggestive of recurrent disease.

The first report described the antitumor and side effects of a single dose. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate toxicity and antitumor activity after single and repetitive therapies.  Methods:   Thirty-four men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer received PSMA-RLT with 131I-MIP-1095. Twenty-three patients received a second, and three patients a third dose, timed at PSA progression after an initial response to the preceding therapy. The applied doses were separated in three groups: <3.5, 3.5-5.0 and >5.0 GBq. Antitumor and side-effects were analyzed by blood samples and other clinical data. Follow-up was conducted for up to 5 years.  Results:   The best therapeutic effect was achieved by the first therapy. A PSA decline of ≥50% was achieved in 70.6% of the patients. The second and third therapies were significantly less effective. There was neither an association between the applied activity and PSA response or the time-to-progression. Hematologic toxicities were less prevalent but presented in a higher percentage of patients with increasing number of therapies. After hematologic toxicities, xerostomia was the second most frequent side effect and presented more often and with higher intensity after the second or third therapy.  Conclusion:   The first dose of RLT with 131I-MIP-1095 presented with low side effects and could significantly reduce the tumor burden in a majority of patients.

Enzalutamide is a potent inhibitor of androgen receptor signaling. Preclinical data in estrogen-expressing breast cancer models demonstrated activity of enzalutamide monotherapy and enhanced activity when combined with various endocrine therapies (ET). Enzalutamide is a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducer, and ETs are commonly metabolized by CYP3A4. The pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions, safety, and tolerability of enzalutamide monotherapy and in combination with ETs were assessed in this phase I/Ib study.Experimental Design: Enzalutamide monotherapy was assessed in dose-escalation and dose-expansion cohorts of patients with advanced breast cancer. Additional cohorts examined effects of enzalutamide on anastrozole, exemestane, and fulvestrant PK in patients with estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive (ER+/PgR+) breast cancer.Results: Enzalutamide monotherapy (n = 29) or in combination with ETs (n = 70) was generally well tolerated. Enzalutamide PK in women was similar to prior data on PK in men with prostate cancer. Enzalutamide decreased plasma exposure to anastrozole by approximately 90% and exemestane by approximately 50%. Enzalutamide did not significantly affect fulvestrant PK. Exposure of exemestane 50 mg/day given with enzalutamide was similar to exemestane 25 mg/day alone.Conclusions: These results support a 160 mg/day enzalutamide dose in women with breast cancer. Enzalutamide can be given in combination with fulvestrant without dose modifications. Exemestane should be doubled from 25 mg/day to 50 mg/day when given in combination with enzalutamide; this combination is being investigated in a randomized phase II study in patients with ER+/PgR+ breast cancer.

Setting:   Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.  Participants:   The definition of a patient with COPD was a patient with a discharge diagnosis of COPD or at least 3 ambulatory visits for COPD. The index date was the date of the first COPD diagnosis. Patients with a history of malignancy disorders before the index date were excluded. After matching age and gender, 13 289 patients with COPD and 26 578 control participants without COPD were retrieved and analysed. They were followed from the index date to malignancy diagnosis, death or the end of study follow-up (31 December 2011), whichever came first.  Primary outcome measures:   Patients were diagnosed with cancer (n=1681, 4.2%; 973 (7.3%) for patients with COPD and 728 (2.7%) for patients without COPD). The risk of 7 major cancer types, including lung, liver, colorectal, breast, prostate, stomach and oesophagus, between patients with COPD and patients without COPD was also estimated.  Results:   The mean age of all study participants was 57.9±13.5 years. The average length of follow-up to cancer incidence was 3.9 years for patients with COPD and 5.0 years for patients without COPD (p<0.01). Patients with COPD were diagnosed with cancer (n=973, 73%) at a significantly higher rate than patients without COPD (n=708, 2.7%; p<0.01). The HR for developing cancer in patients with COPD was 2.8 (95% CI 2.6 to 3.1) compared with patients without COPD after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. The most common cancers in patients with COPD include lung, liver, colorectal, breast, prostate and stomach cancers.

We found that, after AKT-mediated phosphorylation at serine 319, FOXO1 binds to IQGAP1, a hub for activation of the MAPK pathway, and impedes IQGAP1-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2). Conversely, decreased FOXO1 expression increases pERK1/2 in cancer cell lines and correlates with increased pERK1/2 levels in patient specimens and disease progression. Treatment of cancer cells with PI3K inhibitors or taxane causes FOXO1 localization in the nucleus, increased expression of pERK1/2, and drug resistance. These effects are reversed by administering a small FOXO1-derived phospho-mimicking peptide inhibitor in vitro and in mice. Our results show a tumor suppressor role of AKT-phosphorylated FOXO1 in the cytoplasm and suggest that this function of FOXO1 can be harnessed to overcome chemoresistance in cancer.""","""['Chun-Wu Pan', 'Xin Jin', 'Yu Zhao', 'Yunqian Pan', 'Jing Yang', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Jun Zhang', 'Liguo Wang', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""EMBO J""","""['And Akt-ion!

However, TRUS-guided biopsy can result in underdetection of clinically significant cancers as well as diagnosis of clinically insignificant cancers. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) might improve the diagnostic pathway and help to avoid unnecessary biopsies.  Design and methods:   The PROKOMB (Prostata - Kooperatives MRT-Projekt Berlin) study is a prospective two-arm multicentre study designed to evaluate the potential role of mpMRI as a triage test before biopsy. Up to 600 biopsy-naïve men with suspicion for PCa undergo mpMRI at two dedicated imaging centers. Only patients with equivocal or suspicious lesions on mpMRI undergo prostate biopsy including systematic as well as MRI-guided targeted biopsies at several different community-based urologists or hospitals. The PROKOMB study is designed to evaluate how many biopsies can be avoided, how many clinically insignificant cancers are diagnosed on prostate biopsy in patients with positive findings on mpMRI, and how many clinically significant cancers are missed using this alternative diagnostic pathway. For the purpose of this study clinically significant PCa is defined as Gleason ≥3+4 cancer. In addition, the detection rates of different techniques for MRI-guided biopsy are evaluated as well as psychological distress before mpMRI and after the diagnosis of PCa.

Gleason score ≥ 8 was associated with higher risk of CSM (p=0.009). OCM rates were comparable between both groups in the low- and intermediate-risk categories (p=0.354 and p=0.643, respectively). For high-risk patients, RT±ADT resulted in higher OCM rates than RP (p=0.011). Predictors of OCM were age ≥ 75 years (p=0.002) and CCI ≥ 2 (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   RP and RT±ADT provide comparable CSM outcomes in patients with localized or locally advanced PCa.

A total of 214 men with prostate cancer in New Zealand completed a survey questionnaire describing aspects of their networks including opportunities for connection, social support/undermining, status disclosure, communication efficacy, and HRQOL. The findings support a mediating model of communication networks where social undermining has a direct and negative impact on HRQOL, and an indirect effect mediated through communication efficacy, which has a direct and positive impact on HRQOL.

Second, the fatalistic belief, ""There's not much you can do to lower your chances of getting cancer,"" is more prevalent among those who perceived a higher risk of developing cancer. Third, older participants (those between 55 and 70 years old) and widowed are less likely to think of death when they think of cancer. In addition, those who use the Internet to look for health or medical information (i.e., engaging in health information seeking) are less likely to agree with the fatalistic belief: ""It seems like everything causes cancer.""

Early studies demonstrate that only stem-like basal cells in the normal human prostate (NHP) can function as the cell of origin for prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we show that the organoids derived from bulk NHP luminal cells can also be tumorigenically transformed. We further show that the WIT medium, which is used to culture human mammary epithelial progenitor cells, when combined with the ROCK inhibitor, can readily propagate a population of progenitor-like cells from the primary NHP luminal cell isolates. Such functionally defined luminal progenitors can be transformed by distinct sets of genetic perturbations (i.e., AR+AKT/ERG or c-MYC+PTEN knockout) to form tumor glands. Genome-wide RNA-Seq analysis of freshly purified unperturbed human benign prostatic basal and luminal cells and culture-expanded lineage-specific stem/progenitor populations reveals that the luminal progenitors possess a distinct gene expression profile that is greatly enriched in advanced, castration-resistant, and metastatic PCa, and it associates with poor patient survival. The ability of the simple two-dimensional culture system reported herein to greatly enrich NHP progenitor-like cells should facilitate biological and biochemical studies as well as high-throughput screening in these cells and in progenitor-like PCa cells.

In this paper we present a case of a patient with lung cancer and metastatic-related giant hepatomegaly.  Patient concerns:   A 78-year-old previously healthy male was admitted in the Emergency room in hepatic coma.  Diagnoses:   The abdominal CT scan examination revealed a huge liver filled with solid nodules.  Interventions:   No interventions were performed.  Outcomes:   The patient died at few hours after hospitalization. The autopsy showed a 6.5 kilograms liver with several whitish metastatic nodules and an occult prostate adenocarcinoma. The hilum of both lungs was free of tumor and a 10 mm white nodule was identified surrounding a small bronchus. No peripheral nodules were macroscopically identified. Under microscope, cluster of small cells were observed encasing a small bronchus with multiple minute coin-shaped subpleural foci. A massive intrapulmonary angiolymphatic invasion and metastases from small cell carcinoma in liver, lymph nodes and iliac crest bone marrow were also diagnosed.  Lessons:   This case highlights the difficulty of diagnosis of aggressive lung carcinomas and the necessity of checking for metachronous tumors. The encephalopathy might be the result of metastatic damage of the liver parenchyma combined with the paraneoplastic effect of the tumor cells.

Hypofractionated RT is given over a shorter time with larger doses per treatment than standard RT. We hypothesized that hypofractionation versus conventional fractionation is similar in efficacy without increased toxicity. Patients and Methods We conducted a multicenter randomized noninferiority trial in intermediate-risk prostate cancer (T1 to 2a, Gleason score ≤ 6, and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] 10.1 to 20 ng/mL; T2b to 2c, Gleason ≤ 6, and PSA ≤ 20 ng/mL; or T1 to 2, Gleason = 7, and PSA ≤ 20 ng/mL). Patients were allocated to conventional RT of 78 Gy in 39 fractions over 8 weeks or to hypofractionated RT of 60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. Androgen deprivation was not permitted with therapy. The primary outcome was biochemical-clinical failure (BCF) defined by any of the following: PSA failure (nadir + 2), hormonal intervention, clinical local or distant failure, or death as a result of prostate cancer. The noninferiority margin was 7.5% (hazard ratio, < 1.32). Results Median follow-up was 6.0 years. One hundred nine of 608 patients in the hypofractionated arm versus 117 of 598 in the standard arm experienced BCF. Most of the events were PSA failures. The 5-year BCF disease-free survival was 85% in both arms (hazard ratio [short v standard], 0.96; 90% CI, 0.77 to 1.2). Ten deaths as a result of prostate cancer occurred in the short arm and 12 in the standard arm. No significant differences were detected between arms for grade ≥ 3 late genitourinary and GI toxicity. Conclusion The hypofractionated RT regimen used in this trial was not inferior to conventional RT and was not associated with increased late toxicity.

The objective of the study was to determine the interaction between 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) and periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT) and factors of prostate cancer aggressiveness. In this retrospective study, we identified 61 patients treated with 5ARIs for a period of ≥12 months before undergoing radiation therapy (brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy). The control group consisted of 117 patients without any exposure to 5ARIs. Prior to being treated, all patients underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT). To measure PPAT, we defined the fat pad anteriorly to the prostate, as well as the intra-abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous tissue (SAT) at the level of L4/L5. All contours were performed manually. These adipose tissue measurements were correlated with the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score using Pearson correlation coefficient. Differences in fat contents were evaluated using Student's t-test. Median time on 5ARIs for the 61 patients was 12 months (range 12-96). Patient on 5ARIs had a significantly (p < 0.001) smaller PPAT (0.4, SD 0.5) than patients without a 5ARI (0.6 cc, SD 0.4). There was no significant correlation between the CAPRA score and fat measurements when adjusted for 5ARI use (p = 0.18). In non-5ARI users, BMI was not correlated with PPAT but was correlated with SAT and VAT volume and its density. There were no significant differences in diabetics (p = 0.3), metformin users (p = 0.4) or statin users (p = 0.09) between both groups. 5ARIs taken for at least 12 months induce changes in PPAT volume.

Patients and methods:   A total of 960 biopsy series, taken within the period of 1 year, were evaluated, including 301 MRI-guided and 659 transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsies.  Results:   The positivity rate and proportion of high grade cancers were significantly higher in MRI-guided than in TRUS-guided biopsies. Of 301 MRI-guided biopsies, 65.4% contained cancer while 57.2% of 659 TRUS biopsies contained cancer (P = 0.016). Gleason grade 3 + 3 = 6 disease was observed in 16.8% of 197 MRI-guided and in 36.1% of 377 TRUS-guided biopsies (P < 0.001). There was also a markedly higher quantity of cancer tissue in MRI-guided biopsies. In all cancers, the mean cancer surface area was 64.8 ± 51.6 mm2 in MRI-guided biopsies as compared with 23.0 ± 31.4 mm2 in non-MRI-guided biopsies (P < 0.001). With respect to the tissue quantity, superiority of MRI-guided biopsy was highest in Gleason grade 3 + 3 = 6 cancers (20.9 ± 27.9 vs 5.1 ± 10.2 mm2 ; P < 0.001) and in Gleason grade 3 + 4 = 7 cancers (59.7 ± 38.0 vs 17.7 ± 18.4 mm2 ; P < 0.001). Comparison of biopsy Gleason grades with findings in prostatectomy specimens was possible in 80 patients with MRI-guided and in 170 patients with non-MRI-guided biopsies. This comparison showed a very high but almost identical concordance of TRUS- and MRI-guided biopsies with the prostatectomy specimen findings. With both approaches, undetected high-risk cancers were present in ~10% of patients with low-risk biopsy results. A significant difference was observed, however, in the proportion of patients who had clinically insignificant cancers and who underwent surgery. The proportion of patients with Gleason grade 3 + 3 = 6 carcinoma in their prostatectomy specimen was 11.2% in the post-TRUS biopsy cohort, but only 2.5% in the post-MRI biopsy cohort (P = 0.021).  Conclusion:   MRI-guided transgluteal prostate biopsy has a high detection rate for high-risk carcinomas, while the risk of detecting clinically insignificant carcinomas appears to be reduced. This may by itself lead to a reduction of unnecessary prostatectomies. Overtreatment may be further avoided by better applicability of molecular testing to MRI-guided biopsies because of the excessive amount of tissue available for analysis, especially in patients with potential low-risk carcinomas.""","""['Stefan Steurer', 'Sebastian Dwertmann Rico', 'Ronald Simon', 'Sarah Minner', 'Maria Christina Tsourlakis', 'Till Krech', 'Christina Koop', 'Markus Graefen', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Meike Adam', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Guido Sauter', 'Agron Lumiani']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-transectal ultrasound image-fusion biopsies accurately characterize the index tumor: correlation with step-sectioned radical prostatectomy specimens in 135 patients.', 'Cribriform morphology predicts upstaging after radical prostatectomy in patients with Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer at transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided needle biopsy.', 'Comparison of Gleason upgrading rates in transrectal ultrasound systematic random biopsies versus US-MRI fusion biopsies for prostate cancer.', 'Beyond transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies: available techniques and approaches.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'MRI-guided in-bore biopsy for prostate cancer: what does the evidence say?

The aim of this study was to investigate CTC detection and phenotyping as prognostic biomarkers for response to primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) of metastatic prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   PC patients presenting with a prostate specific antigen (PSA) >80 ng/ml and/or metastatic disease, intended for ADT were enrolled in the study. CTCs were analysed for expression of PSA prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) before and three months after ADT and related to progression.  Results:   At inclusion, 46 out of 53 patients (87%) were CTC-positive with a sensitivity and specificity for distant metastases (M1) of 98% and 75%, respectively. In patients with M1-disease, EGFR-detection in CTC was an independent prognostic marker for progression-free survival, whereas PSA and alkaline phosphatase serum levels, Gleason score, or T-stage were not. EGFR-positive patients had significantly shorter time to progression (5 months) compared to EGFR-negative patients (11 months) (P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   In this explorative study, CTCs were detected in 98% of M1 patients and detection of EGFR in CTCs was strongly associated with poor outcome, which indicated that phenotypical analysis of CTC could be a promising prognostic marker of ADT-response in castration-naïve metastatic PC patients.

We based our study on the assumption that interfractional target shape variations are not negligible as another source of uncertainty for the determination of precise CTV-to-PTV margins. Thus, we investigated the interfractional shape variations of CTVs based on a point distribution model (PDM) for prostate cancer radiation therapy.  Materials and methods:   To quantitate the shape variations of CTVs, the PDM was applied for the contours of 4 types of CTV regions (low-risk, intermediate- risk, high-risk CTVs, and prostate plus entire seminal vesicles), which were delineated by considering prostate cancer risk groups on planning computed tomography (CT) and cone beam CT (CBCT) images of 73 fractions of 10 patients. The standard deviations (SDs) of the interfractional random errors for shape variations were obtained from covariance matrices based on the PDMs, which were generated from vertices of triangulated CTV surfaces. The correspondences between CTV surface vertices were determined based on a thin-plate spline robust point matching algorithm. The systematic error for shape variations was defined as the average deviation between surfaces of an average CTV and planning CTVs, and the random error as the average deviation of CTV surface vertices for fractions from an average CTV surface.  Results:   The means of the SDs of the systematic errors for the four types of CTVs ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 mm along the anterior direction, 1.2 to 2.6 mm along the posterior direction, 1.0 to 2.5 mm along the superior direction, 0.9 to 1.9 mm along the inferior direction, 0.9 to 2.6 mm along the right direction, and 1.0 to 3.0 mm along the left direction. Concerning the random errors, the means of the SDs ranged from 0.9 to 1.2 mm along the anterior direction, 1.0 to 1.4 mm along the posterior direction, 0.9 to 1.3 mm along the superior direction, 0.8 to 1.0 mm along the inferior direction, 0.8 to 0.9 mm along the right direction, and 0.8 to 1.0 mm along the left direction.

Methods:   Grounded theory methods were used in the study to explore the way in which family members and friends constructed a role for themselves in relation to patients receiving radiotherapy. A total of 22 helpers were interviewed. Patients were being treated for a range of cancers including breast, prostate, colorectal, and head and neck.  Results:   Respondents in this study consistently defined themselves as ""helpers"" rather than ""carers."" While radiotherapy as a treatment modality was mostly seen as noninvasive, the cancer diagnosis cast a long shadow over the lives of helpers and patients creating a separation in longstanding relationships. Helpers experienced this separation as ""otherness."" Help became an important vehicle for bridging this separation. Individuals developed different ways of knowing about the patient as the basis for providing help. Two different types of help were identified in this study: the behind the scenes, largely invisible work that helpers undertook to help the patient without their knowledge and the explicit visible help that was much more commonly negotiated and discussed between helpers and patients.  Conclusions:   The study provides the basis for a greater understanding on the part of professionals into the impact of diagnosis and radiotherapy treatment on family and friends.

This meta-analysis evaluated the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of custirsen in cancer patients and healthy subjects.  Methods:   The population PK analysis used custirsen plasma concentrations from five Phase 1 studies, one Phase 1/2 study, and one Phase 3 study in two stages. Cancer patients received multiple doses of custirsen (40-640 mg intravenously over 120 min) with chemotherapy; healthy subjects received single or multiple doses (320-640 mg). An interim population PK model was developed using a nonlinear mixed-effect approach incorporating data from four Phase 1 or 1/2 studies, followed by model refinement and inclusion of two Phase 1 and one Phase 3 studies.

In this study we evaluate the concept of using MRI-defined target volumes in terms of tumor control probability (TCP) and rectal normal tissue complication probability (NTCP).  Material and methods:   Twenty-one high-risk prostate cancer patients were included. Pre-treatment CT images, T2 weighted (T2w) MRI and two multi-parametric MRI were acquired. Overlap between a suspicious volume in the SV observed on T2w images and a suspicious volume observed on either multi-parametric MRI was assumed to reflect a true malignant region (named 'MRI positive'). In addition the entire SV on the CT-scan was delineated. Three treatment plans of 2 Gy ×39 fractions were generated per patient: one covering the MRI positive volume in SV and prostate with margin of 11 mm to the MRI positive in the SV and two plans covering prostate and SV using 11 and 7 mm SV margin, respectively. All plans were prescribed the same PTV mean dose. Rectal NTCP grade ≥2 was evaluated with the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model and TCP was estimated by a logistic model using the combined MRI positive volume in SV and prostate as region-of-interest.  Results:   Fourteen of twenty-one patients were classified as MRI positive, six of which had suspicious volumes in all three MRI modalities. On average TCP for the plan covering prostate and the MRI positive volume was 3% higher (up to 11%) than the two other plans which was statistically significant. The increased TCP was obtained without increasing rectal NTCP grade ≥2.

However, direct evidence that PSMA functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We generated mice bearing PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-positive tumors, PSMA-negative tumors were smaller, lower-grade, and more apoptotic with fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of PSMA. Relative to PSMA-positive tumors, tumors lacking PSMA had less than half the abundance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling, and more activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting signaling between the β1 integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway, enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA abundance in PCa cell lines recapitulated this signaling pathway switch. Analysis of published databases indicated that IGF-1R abundance, cell proliferation, and expression of transcripts for antiapoptotic markers positively correlated with PSMA abundance in patients, suggesting that this switch may be relevant to human PCa. Our findings suggest that increase in PSMA in prostate tumors contributes to progression by altering normal signal transduction pathways to drive PCa progression and that enhanced signaling through the IGF-1R/β1 integrin axis may occur in other tumors.""","""['Leslie Ann Caromile', 'Kristina Dortche', 'M Mamunur Rahman', 'Christina L Grant', 'Christopher Stoddard', 'Fernando A Ferrer', 'Linda H Shapiro']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Signal""","""['Prostate specific membrane antigen knockdown impairs the tumorigenicity of LNCaP prostate cancer cells by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway.', 'Elevated AKR1C3 expression promotes prostate cancer cell survival and prostate cell-mediated endothelial cell tube formation: implications for prostate cancer progression.', 'Combined Inhibition of IGF-1R/IR and Src family kinases enhances antitumor effects in prostate cancer by decreasing activated survival pathways.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Biology in Lethal Prostate Cancer and its Therapeutic Implications.', 'The clinical and therapeutic uses of MDM2 and PSMA and their potential interaction in aggressive cancers.', 'The Potential of PSMA as a Vascular Target in TNBC.', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting mirnas to prostate cancer tumors: using psma as an active target.', 'Receptor for activated C kinase 1 promotes cervical cancer lymph node metastasis via the glycolysis‑dependent AKT/mTOR signaling.', 'HER2 Mediates PSMA/mGluR1-Driven Resistance to the DS-7423 Dual PI3K/mTOR Inhibitor in PTEN Wild-type Prostate Cancer Models.', 'Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Influences Prostate Cancer Cell Growth and Invasion through an Integrin α3, α5, αV, and β1 Dependent Mechanism.']"""

Intratumoral inflammation was found to be associated with aggressive prostate cancer. We and others have shown that prostate tumors in African-American (AA) patients harbor a distinct immune and inflammation signature when compared with European-American (EA) patients. These observations suggest that inflammation could be a driver of aggressive disease in men of African descent, leading to the hypothesis that an anti-inflammatory drug like aspirin could prevent disease progression.Methods: We examined the relationship between aspirin use and prostate cancer in the NCI-Maryland Prostate Cancer Case-Control Study consisting of 823 men with incident prostate cancer (422 AA and 401 EA) and 1,034 population-based men without the disease diagnosis (486 AA and 548 EA).Results: We observed a significant inverse association between regular aspirin use and prostate cancer among AA men. Stratification of AA patients by disease stage showed that daily and long-term (>3 years) aspirin use significantly decreased the risk of advanced disease [adjusted ORs for T3/T4 disease: 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17-0.73; and 0.22, 95% CI, 0.08-0.60, respectively], but not early-stage disease (T1/T2). Regular aspirin use also reduced disease recurrence in AA men.Conclusions: Regular aspirin use is associated with a decreased risk of advanced stage prostate cancer and increased disease-free survival in AA men.Impact: Regular aspirin use before and after a prostate cancer diagnosis may prevent the development of aggressive disease in AA men who are at risk of a lethal malignancy.

In an independent set of samples, we could use these models to classify prostate cancer from benign specimens with nearly 90% accuracy per patient. Based on previous work in prostate cancer showing that glucose levels are high while citrate is low, we found that measurement of the glucose/citrate ion signal ratio accurately predicted cancer when this ratio exceeds 1.0 and normal prostate when the ratio is less than 0.5. After brief tissue preparation, the glucose/citrate ratio can be recorded on a tissue sample in 1 min or less, which is in sharp contrast to the 20 min or more required by histopathological examination of frozen tissue specimens.""","""['Shibdas Banerjee', 'Richard N Zare', 'Robert J Tibshirani', 'Christian A Kunder', 'Rosalie Nolley', 'Richard Fan', 'James D Brooks', 'Geoffrey A Sonn']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Diagnosis: Making DESI-MSI desirable.', 'Distinguishing malignant from benign microscopic skin lesions using desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging.', 'Differentiation of prostate cancer from normal tissue in radical prostatectomy specimens by desorption electrospray ionization and touch spray ionization mass spectrometry.', 'Cholesterol sulfate imaging in human prostate cancer tissue by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.', 'Prostate cancer diagnosis and characterization with mass spectrometry imaging.', 'Surface analysis of lipids by mass spectrometry: more than just imaging.', 'Immunometabolic control by Klebsiella pneumoniae.', 'Sample Preparation for Metabolite Detection in Mass Spectrometry Imaging.', 'Characterisation of hepatic lipid signature distributed across the liver zonation using mass spectrometry imaging.', 'Imaging the metabolic reprograming of fatty acid synthesis pathway enables new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunity for breast cancer.', 'Alteration of Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer: Multifaceted Oncologic Implications.']"""

In this report, we present a novel aptamer-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor that employs magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) core-Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) satellite assemblies to detect PSA. The high specific biorecognition between aptamer and PSA caused the dissolution of the core-satellite assemblies, thus the concentration of functionalized AuNPs (signal probes) existing in the supernatant was on the rise with the continual addition of PSA. The aptamer-modified MNPs were used as supporting materials and separation tools in the present sensor. With the assistance of magnet, the mixture was removed from the supernatant for the concentration effects. It was found that the corresponding SERS signals from the supernatant were in direct correlation to PSA concentrations over a wide range and the limit of detection (LOD) was as low as 5.0pg/mL. Excellent recovery was also obtained to assess the feasibility of this method for human serum samples detection. All of these results show a promising application of this method. And this novel sensor can be used for the accurate and highly sensitive detection of PSA in clinic samples in the future.""","""['Kang Yang', 'Yongjun Hu', 'Ning Dong', 'Guichi Zhu', 'Tingfeng Zhu', 'Ningjing Jiang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Electrochemical bioassay development for ultrasensitive aptasensing of prostate specific antigen.', 'An aptamer based resonance light scattering assay of prostate specific antigen.', 'Label-free electrochemical aptasensing of the human prostate-specific antigen using gold nanospears.', 'Application of various optical and electrochemical aptasensors for detection of human prostate specific antigen: A review.', 'Nanomaterial-based biosensors for detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'SERS Immunosensors for Cancer Markers Detection.', 'SERS Determination of Oxidative Stress Markers in Saliva Using Substrates with Silver Nanoparticle-Decorated Silicon Nanowires.', 'SERS Based Lateral Flow Immunoassay for Point-of-Care Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Clinical Samples.', 'Design and synthesis of gold nanostars-based SERS nanotags for bioimaging applications.', 'Recent Advances in Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Magnetic Plasmonic Particles for Bioapplications.']"""

Methodology:   The patients treated with open radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer were reviewed. Patient characteristics including prostate specific antigen (PSA), free PSA levels, age, biopsy, and radical prostatectomy results were recorded. The patients whose data were complete or prostate weight was equal to or less than 80 gm, were included in the study. Patients with <40 gm prostate weight was in group 1 and the patients in group 2 had a prostate weight from 40 to 80 gm. High grade prostate cancer was defined to have a Gleason score between 7 or higher at biopsy and final pathology. Pathology and biopsy results were compared within groups.

Guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, ﻿and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, this paper reports on the adoption, reach, and implementation of Project HEAL (Health through Early Awareness and Learning)-a community-based implementation trial of a cancer educational intervention in 14 African American churches. We compare adoption, reach, and implementation at the organizational and participant level for churches in which lay peer community health advisors (CHAs) were trained using traditional classroom didactic methods compared with a new online system.  Methods:   Fifteen churches were randomized to one of two study groups in which two CHAs per church were trained through either classroom (""Traditional""; n = 16 CHAs in 8 churches) or web-based (""Technology""; n = 14 CHAs in 7 churches) training methods. Once trained and certified, all CHAs conducted a series of three group educational workshops in their churches on cancer early detection (breast, prostate, and colorectal). Adoption, reach, and implementation were assessed using multiple data sources including church-level data, participant engagement in the workshops, and study staff observations of CHA performance.  Results:   The project had a 41% overall adoption rate at the church level. In terms of reach, a total of 375 participants enrolled in Project HEAL-226 participants in the Traditional group (43% reach) and 149 in the Technology group (21% reach; p < .10). Implementation was evaluated in terms of adherence, dosage, and quality. All churches fully completed the three workshops; however, the Traditional churches took somewhat longer (M = 84 days) to complete the workshop series than churches in the Technology group (M = 64 days). Other implementation outcomes were comparable between both the Traditional and Technology groups (p > .05).  Conclusions:   Overall, the Project HEAL intervention had reasonable adoption, though reach could have been better.

The device is designed to be mounted on the linac accessory tray to measure and verify photon energy, field shape, gantry position, and fluence before and during patient treatment.  Methods:   Our institution evaluated the newly developed ion chamber's effect on photon beam fluence, response to dose, detection of photon fluence modification, and the accuracy of the integrated barometer, thermometer, and inclinometer. The detection of photon fluence modifications was performed by measuring 6 MV with fields of 10 cm × 10 cm and 1 cm × 1 cm ""correct"" beam, and then altering the beam modifiers to simulate minor and major delivery deviations. The type and magnitude of the deviations selected for evaluation were based on the specifications for photon output and MLC position reported in AAPM Task Group Report 142. Additionally, the change in ion chamber signal caused by a simulated IMRT delivery error is evaluated.  Results:   The device attenuated 6 MV, 10 MV, and 15 MV photon beams by 5.43 ± 0.02%, 4.60 ± 0.02%, and 4.21 ± 0.03%, respectively. Photon beam profiles were altered with the IQM by < 1.5% in the nonpenumbra regions of the beams. The photon beam profile for a 1 cm × 1 cm2 fields were unchanged by the presence of the device. The large area ion chamber measurements were reproducible on the same day with a 0.14% standard deviation and stable over 4 weeks with a 0.47% SD. The ion chamber's dose-response was linear (R2 = 0.99999). The integrated thermometer agreed to a calibrated thermometer to within 1.0 ± 0.7°C. The integrated barometer agreed to a mercury barometer to within 2.3 ± 0.4 mmHg. The integrated inclinometer gantry angle measurement agreed with the spirit level at 0 and 180 degrees within 0.03 ± 0.01 degrees and 0.27 ± 0.03 at 90 and 270 degrees. For the collimator angle measurement, the IQM inclinometer agreed with a plum-bob within 0.3 ± 0.2 degrees. The simulated IMRT error increased the ion chamber signal by a factor of 11-238 times the baseline measurement for each segment.  Conclusions:   The device signal was dependent on variations in MU delivered, field position, single MLC leaf position, and nominal photon energy for both the 1 cm × 1 cm and 10 cm × 10 cm fields.

FB plans were generated from the RayStation FB module by simulating the original plan target and organ at risk (OAR) dose distribution and delivered in various backup linear accelerators. In this study, helical tomotherapy (HT) backup plans used in Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator were generated with the RayStation FB module. About 30 patients, 10 with lung cancer, 10 with head and neck (HN) cancer, and 10 with prostate cancer, who were treated with HT, were included in this study. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy Fallback plans (FB-IMRT) were generated for all patients, and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy Fallback plans (FB-3D) were only generated for lung cancer patients. Dosimetric comparison study evaluated FB plans based on dose coverage to 95% of the PTV volume (R95), PTV mean dose (Dmean), Paddick's conformity index (CI), and dose homogeneity index (HI). The evaluation results showed that all IMRT plans were statistically comparable between HT and FB-IMRT plans except that PTV HI was worse in prostate, and PTV R95 and HI were worse in HN multitarget plans for FB-IMRT plans. For 3D lung cancer plans, only the PTV R95 was statistically comparable between HT and FB-3D plans, PTV Dmean was higher, and CI and HI were worse compared to HT plans. The FB plans using a TrueBeam linear accelerator generally offer better OAR sparing compared to HT plans for all the patients.

Forty-one low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with image-guided proton therapy with rectal spacer hydrogel were analyzed. To assess the reproducibility of rectal sparing with the hydrogel spacer, three to four QACTs were performed for each patient on day 1 and during weeks 1, 3, and 5 of treatment. The treatment plan was calculated on the QACT and the rectum V90%, V75%, V65%, V50%, and V40% were evaluated. For the retrospective analysis, we evaluated each QACT and compared it to the corresponding treatment planning CT (TPCT), to determine the average change in rectum DVH points. We were also interested in how many patients exceeded an upper rectum V90% threshold on a QACT. Finally, we were interested in a correlation between rectum volume and V90%. On each QACT, if the rectum V90% exceeded the upper threshold of 6%, the attending physician was notified and the patient was typically prescribed additional stool softeners or laxatives and reminded of dietary compliance. In all cases of the rectum V90% exceeding the threshold, the patient had increased gas and/or stool, compared to the TPCT. On average, the rectum V90% calculated on the QACT was 0.81% higher than that calculated on the TPCT. The average increase in V75%, V65%, V50%, and V40% on the QACT was 1.38%, 1.59%, 1.87%, and 2.17%, respectively. The rectum V90% was within ± 1% of the treatment planning dose in 71.2% of the QACTs, and within ± 5% in 93.2% of the QACTs. The 6% threshold for rectum V90% was exceeded in 7 out of 144 QACTs (4.8%), identified in 5 of the 41 patients. We evaluated the average rectum V90% across all QACTs for each of these patients, and it was found that the rectum V90% never exceeded 6%. 53% of the QACTs had a rectum volume within 5 cm3 of the TPCT volume, 68% were within 10 cm3. We found that patients who exceeded the threshold on one or more QACTs had a lower TPCT rectal volume than the overall average. By extrapolating patient anatomy from three to four QACT scans, we have shown that the use of hydrogel in conjunction with our patient diet program and use of stool softeners is effective in achieving consistent rectal sparing in patients undergoing proton therapy.""","""['Samantha G Hedrick', 'Marcio Fagundes', 'Sara Case', 'Jackson Renegar', 'Marc Blakey', 'Mark Artz', 'Hao Chen', 'Ben Robison', 'Niek Schreuder']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Maximizing rectal dose sparing with hydrogel: A retrospective planning study.', 'Ion therapy of prostate cancer: daily rectal dose reduction by application of spacer gel.', 'Comparison of rectal dose reduction by a hydrogel spacer among 3D conformal radiotherapy, volumetric-modulated arc therapy, helical tomotherapy, CyberKnife and proton therapy.', 'Rectal radiation dose-reduction techniques in prostate cancer: a focus on the rectal spacer.', 'Absorbable Hydrogel Spacer Use in Prostate Radiotherapy: A Comprehensive Review of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Published Data.', 'Dosimetric Effects of the Supine and Prone Positions in Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Quantifying the impact of SpaceOAR hydrogel on inter-fractional rectal and bladder dose during 0.35\xa0T MR-guided prostate adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric effects of quality assurance-related setup errors in passive proton therapy for prostate cancer with and without a hydrogel spacer.', 'Expanding the Utilization of Rectal Spacer Hydrogel for Larger Prostate Glands (>80 cc): Feasibility and Dosimetric Outcomes.', 'Preliminary analysis of prostate positional displacement using hydrogel spacer during the course of proton therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

We have developed a prostate HDR brachytherapy technology that integrates intraoperative TRUS-based prostate contour into HDR treatment planning through TRUS-CT deformable registration (TCDR) to improve prostate contour accuracy. In a perspective study of 16 patients, we investigated the clinical feasibility as well as the performance of this TCDR-based HDR approach. We compared the performance of the TCDR-based approach with the conventional CT-based HDR in terms of prostate contour accuracy using MRI as the gold standard. For all patients, the average Dice prostate volume overlap was 91.1 ± 2.3% between the TCDR-based and the MRI-defined prostate volumes. In a subset of eight patients, inter and intro-observer reliability study was conducted among three experienced physicians (two radiation oncologists and one radiologist) for the TCDR-based HDR approach. Overall, a 10 to 40% improvement in prostate volume accuracy can be achieved with the TCDR-based approach as compared with the conventional CT-based prostate volumes. The TCDR-based prostate volumes match closely to the MRI-defined prostate volumes for all 3 observers (mean volume difference: 0.5 ± 7.2%, 1.8 ± 7.2%, and 3.5 ± 5.1%); while CT-based contours overestimated prostate volumes by 10.9 ± 28.7%, 13.7 ± 20.1%, and 44.7 ± 32.1%. This study has shown that the TCDR-based HDR brachytherapy is clinically feasible and can significantly improve prostate contour accuracy over the conventional CT-based prostate contour. We also demonstrated the reliability of the TCDR-based prostate delineation. This TCDR-based HDR approach has the potential to enable accurate dose planning and delivery, and potentially enhance prostate HDR treatment outcome.""","""['Xiaofeng Yang', 'Peter J Rossi', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Hui Mao', 'Zhengyang Zhou', 'Walter J Curran', 'Tian Liu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Prostate CT segmentation method based on nonrigid registration in ultrasound-guided CT-based HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of MRI-to-ultrasound automated image registration algorithms for prostate brachytherapy.', 'MRI-TRUS registration methodology for TRUS-guided HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Application of three-dimensional multi-imaging combination in brachytherapy of cervical cancer.', 'Catheter position prediction using deep-learning-based multi-atlas registration for high-dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Computed tomography versus magnetic resonance imaging in high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy planning: The impact on patient-reported health-related quality of life.', 'CT prostate segmentation based on synthetic MRI-aided deep attention fully convolution network.']"""

Source strengths ranging from 0.395 to 0.504 U/seed were available for this study. Three different seed configurations were measured: loose, linked, and loaded needles. A third-party 10% assay (NIST traceable) was provided. A custom stand was built out of aluminum to hold an exposure meter [Inovision (Fluke) 451P pressurized ion chamber] at 25 cm above the I-125 sources to measure the exposure rate. The measurements were made in an operating room, and a sterile sheet was placed under the nonsterile aluminum stand on a sterile loading table. Seeds and needles were placed in a sterile tray for these measurements. Two hundred and six loose seeds in six batches (0.395, 0.395, 0.409, 0.444, 0.444, and 0.444 U/seed) and 1434 seeds in 10 batches containing various strands (0.444, 0.444, 0.444, 0.444, .0444, 0.466, 0.466, 0.504, and 0.504 U/seed) were measured.

Loaded needles were measured with an average exposure rate per unit activity to be 0.269 mR/h·U with a standard deviation of 0.014.

A total of 20 patients were included in this study who received photon therapy (12 with rectal spacer (DuraSeal™ gel) and 8 without). Two PBS treatment plans were retrospectively created for each patient using the following beam arrangements: (1) lateral-opposed (LAT) fields and (2) left and right anterior oblique (LAO/RAO) fields. Dose volume histograms (DVH) were generated for the prostate, rectum, bladder, and right and left femoral heads. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for ≥grade 2 rectal toxicity was calculated using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model and compared between patients with and without the rectal spacer. A significantly lower mean rectal DVH was achieved in patients with rectal spacer compared to those without. For LAT plans, the mean rectal V70 with and without rectal spacer was 4.19 and 13.5%, respectively. For LAO/RAO plans, the mean rectal V70 with and without rectal spacer was 5.07 and 13.5%, respectively. No significant differences were found in any rectal dosimetric parameters between the LAT and the LAO/RAO plans generated with the rectal spacers. We found that ≥ 9 mm space resulted in a significant decrease in NTCP modeled for ≥grade 2 rectal toxicity. Rectal spacers can significantly decrease modeled rectal dose and predicted ≥grade 2 rectal toxicity in prostate cancer patients treated in silico with PBS.

A peak of incidence was reached in 2003-2004 in some areas, while in others the incidence is still increasing. Mortality has declined since 1999 in some areas, while it remains stable in others. We compared mortality and the risk of advanced cancer over 2 periods (1996-1998; 2005-2007) and by geographic area characterized by a different spread of PSA, to understand the possible impact of PSA on the epidemiology of prostate cancer.  Methods:   In 8 Italian Cancer Registries (CRs), 4,632 cases diagnosed over 2 periods, 1996-1998 and 2005-2007, were sampled to assess risk class. The CRs were classified into late and early phase of PSA testing depending on whether an incidence peak had been reached by 2008. Incidence by risk class was estimated based on overall incidence in each CR and on risk class distribution in the sample. We calculated standardized mortality (MRR) and risk class-specific incidence rate ratios (IRR) to compare the 2 periods.  Results:   Incidence increased from 1996-1998 to 2005-2007 (IRR 1.5; 95% CI 1.4, 1.6). High-risk and metastatic cancer incidence decreased only in late-phase areas (IRR 0.78; 95% CI 0.69, 0.88; and 0.40; 95% CI 0.30, 0.54, respectively), while in early-phase areas, incidence remained virtually stable (IRR 1.2; 95% CI 1.0, 1.4; and 0.77; 95% CI 0.59, 1.0, respectively). Mortality decreased only in late-phase areas (MRR 0.81; 95% CI 0.85, 0.97; vs 1.1; 95% CI 0.92, 1.2) in early-phase areas.

These require activation of signalling cascades modulated by the number of regulatory molecules. One such molecule is CD151, a member of evolutionary conserved tetraspanin family. CD151 is involved in cell adhesion, motility and cancer progression due to formation of complexes with laminin-binding integrins and regulation of growth factor receptors function (e.g. HGFR, TGFβR, EGFR). Recent studies point to correlation between CD151 expression and high tumour grade in prostate cancer (PCa). Herein, we investigated a possible role of CD151 in communication between PC3 cancer cells and either cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) or osteoblasts, an interplay which is significant for metastasis. The analysis showed that although CAFs strongly enhanced both migration and invasion of PC3 prostate cancer cells, the effect was not dependent on CD151. On the other hand, CD151 was found to promote 3D migration as well as invasive growth in response to osteoblasts-secreted growth factors. Obtained data revealed that knockdown of CD151 abolished activation of pro-migratory/pro-survival kinases (i.e FAK, Src, HSP27) triggered by osteoblasts, along with expression of matrix metalloproteinase-13. This suggests that CD151 participates in communication between PC3 cells and bone microenvironment and the process can be considered as a significant step of PCa progression and metastasis.""","""['Alicja Grudowska', 'Dominika Czaplińska', 'Wojciech Polom', 'Marcin Matuszewski', 'Rafał Sądej', 'Andrzej C Składanowski']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Biochim Pol""","""['Integrin-free tetraspanin CD151 can inhibit tumor cell motility upon clustering and is a clinical indicator of prostate cancer progression.', 'The migration and invasion of human prostate cancer cell lines involves CD151 expression.', 'CD151 promotes α3β1 integrin-dependent organization of carcinoma cell junctions and restrains collective cell invasion.', 'CD151 in cancer progression and metastasis: a complex scenario.', 'The role of exosomal tetraspanins and proteases in tumor progression.', 'Deregulated molecules and pathways in the predisposition and dissemination of breast cancer cells to bone.', 'Extracellular Vesicles in Tumors: A Potential Mediator of Bone Metastasis.', 'Beyond adhesion:\xa0emerging roles for integrins in control of the tumor microenvironment.']"""

This study proposes a novel method based on the linear quadratic model to predict the reduction in metastatic tumour burden as a function of the absorbed doses delivered from molecular radiotherapy treatments. The range of absorbed doses necessary to eradicate all the bone lesions and to reduce the metastatic burden was investigated in a cohort of 22 patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer. A metastatic burden reduction curve was generated for each patient, which predicts the reduction in metastatic burden as a function of the patient mean absorbed dose, defined as the mean of all the lesion absorbed doses in any given patient. In the patient cohort studied, the median of the patient mean absorbed dose predicted to reduce the metastatic burden by 50% was 89 Gy (interquartile range: 83-105 Gy), whilst a median of 183 Gy (interquartile range: 107-247 Gy) was found necessary to eradicate all metastases in a given patient. The absorbed dose required to eradicate all the lesions was strongly correlated with the variability of the absorbed doses delivered to multiple lesions in a given patient (r = 0.98, P < 0.0001). The metastatic burden reduction curves showed a potential large reduction in metastatic burden for a small increase in absorbed dose in 91% of patients. The results indicate the range of absorbed doses required to potentially obtain a significant survival benefit. The metastatic burden reduction method provides a simple tool that could be used in routine clinical practice for patient selection and to indicate the required administered activity to achieve a predicted patient mean absorbed dose and reduction in metastatic tumour burden.""","""['Ana M Denis-Bacelar', 'Sarah J Chittenden', 'Iain Murray', 'Antigoni Divoli', 'V Ralph McCready', 'David P Dearnaley', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Bernadette Johnson', 'Glenn D Flux']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Phase I/II trials of 186Re-HEDP in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: post-hoc analysis of the impact of administered activity and dosimetry on survival.', 'Bone lesion absorbed dose profiles in patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated with molecular radiotherapy.', 'A Phase 1, Open-Label Study of the Biodistribution, Pharmacokinetics, and Dosimetry of 223Ra-Dichloride in Patients with Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer and Skeletal Metastases.', 'Radium-223 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Clinical Development and Use in Contemporary Practice.', 'Optimal usage of radium-223 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Trifunctional PSMA-targeting constructs for prostate cancer with unprecedented localization to LNCaP tumors.']"""

We have seen multiple consultation cases where the differential diagnosis of these radiated prostate glands included urothelial carcinoma, with multilayered to solid-appearing proliferations that were positive by immunohistochemistry for GATA3. To formally investigate this issue, 30 cases of benign prostate tissue with radiation atypia, from 1990 to 2015, were obtained from our institution. Cases were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for the prostate-specific markers prostate-specific antigen (PSA), P501S (Prostein), and NKX3.1 and urothelial markers GATA3 and uroplakin 2. GATA3 was positive in 100% of cases, with 70% showing moderately strong to strong staining in a mostly patchy manner within a gland. PSA was positive in 93.3% of cases, with 89.2% showing moderately strong to strong staining in a mostly diffuse manner. P501S was positive in 96.7% of cases, with 93.1% showing moderately strong to strong staining in a mostly patchy manner. NKX3.1 was positive in 82.8% of cases, with 33.3% showing moderately strong to strong staining in a mostly patchy manner. Uroplakin 2 was negative in 100% of cases. Our findings highlight that GATA3 is often positive in benign prostate glands with radiation atypia, which along with the morphologic features present a pitfall for the misdiagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. A combination of PSA and P501S is the best prostate-specific panel for use in radiated prostate, with the caveat that they are often patchy and do not stain all radiated glands.""","""['Sara E Wobker', 'Armen Khararjian', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Aberrant GATA3 Staining in Prostatic Adenocarcinoma: A Potential Diagnostic Pitfall.', 'GATA3 expression in benign prostate glands with radiation atypia: a diagnostic pitfall.', 'Utility of uroplakin II expression as a marker of urothelial carcinoma.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Value of GATA3 immunostaining in tumor diagnosis: a review.']"""

Results of the present work clearly show that androgens can specifically act at the membrane level via the GPCR oxoeicosanoid receptor 1 (OXER1) in prostate cancer cells. In fact, OXER1 expression parallels that of membrane androgen binding in prostate cancer cell lines and tumor specimens, while in silico docking simulation of OXER1 showed that testosterone could bind to OXER1 within the same grove as 5-OxoETE, the natural ligand of OXER1. Interestingly, testosterone antagonizes the effects of 5-oxoETE on specific signaling pathways and rapid effects such as actin cytoskeleton reorganization that ultimately can modulate cell migration and metastasis. These findings verify that membrane-acting androgens exert specific effects through an antagonistic interaction with OXER1. Additionally, this interaction between androgen and OXER1, which is an arachidonic acid metabolite receptor expressed in prostate cancer, provides a novel link between steroid and lipid actions and renders OXER1 as new player in the disease.

Methods:   Twelve mice were injected with human PC3. The mice were grouped into two groups; one was the paclitaxel-treated group (n=6) and the other was the control group (n=6). Before administering paclitaxel into the peritoneal cavity, baseline CEUS was performed after the administration of 500 μL (1×108 microbubbles) of contrast agent.

As an exprimated urinary marker, its retrieval is subject to certain physical aspects like palpation pressure and detachment force during the squeezing of cells. Other potential factor of influence may be the distance the cells have to cover until they reach the urethra. Thus, it was investigated whether the localization of the tumors within the prostate with regard to the urethra and the seminal colliculus influences the PCA3 score.  Methods:   Prostatectomy specimens of 55 organ-confined prostate cancer patients were processed according to the Stanford protocol. For each prostatectomy specimen, a three-dimensional reconstruction including the surface of the prostate, the tumor areas and the urethra was created. By model simulating, virtual concentric tubes were placed around the urethra and spherical volumes were virtually positioned around the seminal colliculus at diameters of 8, 16 and 32 mm. Depending on localization, tumor volumes may or may not protrude into the tubes or spherical volumes. For each respective diameter, PCA3 levels were compared between the subgroup with and without protrusion of tumor tissue into the tube or spherical ball.  Results:   For none of the diameters, whether in tubes or spherical balls, were patients without intersection volumes-hence showing peripherally located tumors-found to have lower PCA3 levels. No clinical or histopathological parameter correlated with the PCA3 score.  Conclusion:   The location of the tumor mass in the prostate with respect to the urethra or the seminal colliculus did not to affect the PCA3 score. Hence, the location of the tumor does not limit the validity of the PCA3 score, and even for exclusively peripherall y located tumors, this possible influencing factor did not lead to an artificial modulation of the PCA3 score.""","""['Eva Neumann', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Tilman Todenhöfer', 'Marcus Scharpf', 'Tim Neumann', 'David Schilling', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Jens Bedke']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Adv Ther""","""['PCA3 molecular urine assay correlates with prostate cancer tumor volume: implication in selecting candidates for active surveillance.', 'PCA3 score before radical prostatectomy predicts extracapsular extension and tumor volume.', 'Relationship between prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) and characteristics of tumor aggressiveness.', 'Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 as a Tumour Marker: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Effect and Mechanism of lncRNA-PCMF1/hsa-miR-137/Twist1 Axis Involved in\xa0the EMT\xa0Regulation of Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Its aim is to automatically identify patients that can benefit from an adaptive treatment strategy. The study predominantly addresses dosimetric uncertainties and critical issues caused by motion of hollow organs. 1200 MVCT images of 38 prostate adenocarcinoma cases were analyzed. An automatic daily re-contouring of structures (i.e. rectum, bladder and femoral heads), rigid/deformable registration and dose warping was carried out to simulate dose and volume variations during therapy. Support vector machine, K-means clustering algorithms and similarity index analysis were used to create an unsupervised predictive tool to detect incorrect setup and/or morphological changes as a consequence of inadequate patient preparation due to stochastic physiological changes, supporting clinical decision-making. After training on a dataset that was considered sufficiently dosimetrically stable, the system identified two equally sized macro clusters with distinctly different volumetric and dosimetric baseline properties and defined thresholds for these two clusters. Application to the test cohort resulted in 25% of the patients located outside the two macro clusters thresholds and which were therefore suspected to be dosimetrically unstable. In these patients, over the treatment course, mean volumetric changes of 30 and 40% for rectum and bladder were detected which possibly represents values justifying adjustment of patient preparation, frequent re-planning or a plan-of-the-day strategy. Based on our research, by combining daily IGRT images with rigid/deformable registration and dose warping, it is possible to apply a machine learning approach to the clinical setting obtaining useful information for a decision regarding an individualized adaptive strategy. Especially for treatments influenced by the movement of hollow organs, this could reduce inadequate treatments and possibly reduce toxicity, thereby increasing overall RT efficacy.""","""['Gabriele Guidi', 'Nicola Maffei', 'Claudio Vecchi', 'Giovanni Gottardi', 'Alberto Ciarmatori', 'Grazia Maria Mistretta', 'Ercole Mazzeo', 'Patrizia Giacobazzi', 'Frank Lohr', 'Tiziana Costi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Australas Phys Eng Sci Med""","""['A support vector machine tool for adaptive tomotherapy treatments: Prediction of head and neck patients criticalities.', 'Deformable registration of the planning image (kVCT) and the daily images (MVCT) for adaptive radiation therapy.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Advances in 4D medical imaging and 4D radiation therapy.', 'Benefit of intensity modulated and image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Artificial Intelligence and Its Impact on Urological Diseases and Management: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature.', 'Artificial intelligence in radiotherapy.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Clinical Decision Support: a Focused Literature Survey.', 'Applications and limitations of machine learning in radiation oncology.']"""

Procedures:   Eligible patients had CRPC with radiographic evidence of BM and creatinine clearance >30 ml/min. Two baseline [18F]FMAU-PET scans (about 1 week apart, range 2-12 days) were obtained for testing reproducibility. Zoledronic acid 4 mg was infused over 15 min within 1 week after second scan and a third PET scan was obtained 7 days later. The bony lesion with the highest uptake on the first scan was compared with later scans. Bone turnover markers and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were obtained pre- and post-therapy. PET response was defined as decline in SUVmean of ≥15 % after zoledronic acid.  Results:   Eleven patients were evaluated, median age was 65 years, five were African-American and six were Caucasian, and median PSA level was 36.3 ng/ml (range 1.0-1209.3). Notably, the range of absolute percent SUVmax changes varied between 0.77 and 54.7, and only nine measurements were greater than one (1.09-2.19). Zoledronic acid did not appreciably change FMAU uptake. No clinical response was noted. Urine N-telopeptide (NTx) was markedly decreased in all patients after zoledronic acid and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) registered a modest change. Urine NTx correlated more closely with SUV max than serum BSAP.  Conclusions:   FMAU tracer was able to detect bone metastases in CRPC patients but uptake was highly variable in bony lesions. Zoledronic acid did not produce an appreciable change in scans. Future investigations of FMAU tracer as a marker of early response in CRPC is recommended.""","""['Ulka N Vaishampayan', 'Omid S Tehrani', 'Jawana M Lawhorn-Crews', 'Lance K Heilbrun', 'Kimberlee Dobson', 'Daryn Smith', 'Brenda Dickow', 'Anthony F Shields']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastasis response measured by 18F-fluoride PET after treatment with dasatinib and correlation with progression-free survival: results from American College of Radiology Imaging Network 6687.', 'Urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx) is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer.', ""Journey of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-5-methyl-1-β-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (FMAU): from Antiviral Drug to PET Imaging Agent."", 'Zoledronic acid significantly reduces pathologic fractures in patients with advanced-stage prostate cancer metastatic to bone.', 'Exploring Solvent Effects in the Radiosynthesis of 18F-Labeled Thymidine Analogues toward Clinical Translation for Positron Emission Tomography Imaging.', 'Biomarkers and Bone Imaging Dynamics Associated with Clinical Outcomes of Oral Cabozantinib Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Prostate-Associated Gene 4 (PAGE4) is an IDP that acts as a potentiator of the Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor. Homeodomain-Interacting Protein Kinase 1 (HIPK1) phosphorylates PAGE4 at S9 and T51, but only T51 is critical for its activity. Here, we identify a second kinase, CDC-Like Kinase 2 (CLK2), which acts on PAGE4 and hyperphosphorylates it at multiple S/T residues, including S9 and T51. We demonstrate that HIPK1 is expressed in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer (PCa) cells, whereas CLK2 and PAGE4 are expressed only in androgen-dependent cells. Cell-based studies indicate that PAGE4 interaction with the two kinases leads to opposing functions. HIPK1-phosphorylated PAGE4 (HIPK1-PAGE4) potentiates c-Jun, whereas CLK2-phosphorylated PAGE4 (CLK2-PAGE4) attenuates c-Jun activity. Consistent with the cellular data, biophysical measurements (small-angle X-ray scattering, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and NMR) indicate that HIPK1-PAGE4 exhibits a relatively compact conformational ensemble that binds AP-1, whereas CLK2-PAGE4 is more expanded and resembles a random coil with diminished affinity for AP-1. Taken together, the results suggest that the phosphorylation-induced conformational dynamics of PAGE4 may play a role in modulating changes between PCa cell phenotypes. A mathematical model based on our experimental data demonstrates how differential phosphorylation of PAGE4 can lead to transitions between androgen-dependent and androgen-independent phenotypes by altering the AP-1/androgen receptor regulatory circuit in PCa cells.""","""['Prakash Kulkarni', 'Mohit Kumar Jolly', 'Dongya Jia', 'Steven M Mooney', 'Ajay Bhargava', 'Luciane T Kagohara', 'Yihong Chen', 'Pengyu Hao', 'Yanan He', 'Robert W Veltri', 'Alexander Grishaev', 'Keith Weninger', 'Herbert Levine', 'John Orban']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Re: Phosphorylation-Induced Conformational Dynamics in an Intrinsically Disordered Protein and Potential Role in Phenotypic Heterogeneity.', 'PAGE4 and Conformational Switching: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'Structural and Dynamical Order of a Disordered Protein: Molecular Insights into Conformational Switching of PAGE4 at the Systems Level.', 'Exploring Energy Landscapes of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins: Insights into Functional Mechanisms.', 'Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4), an intrinsically disordered cancer/testis antigen, is a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'Cancer/Testis Antigens: ""Smart"" Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Prostate and Other Cancers.', 'Intrinsically disordered proteins and conformational noise: The hypothesis a decade later.', 'Illuminating Intrinsically Disordered Proteins with Integrative Structural Biology.', 'How phosphorylation impacts intrinsically disordered proteins and their function.', 'Emerging Proteins in CRPC: Functional Roles and Clinical Implications.', 'The Activated AMPK/mTORC2 Signaling Pathway Associated with Oxidative Stress in Seminal Plasma Contributes to Idiopathic Asthenozoospermia.']"""

The majority of studies validating this revision have been in Caucasian populations. We therefore asked whether the new GG system was retrospectively associated with biochemical disease-free survival in a mixed-ethnicity cohort of Asian men.  Methods:   A total of 680 radical prostatectomies (RPs) from 2005 to 2014 were included. GS from initial biopsy and RP were compared and used to allocate cases to GG, defined as: 1 (GS≤6); 2 (GS 3+4=7); 3 (GS 4+3=7); 4 (GS 4+4=8/5+3=8/3+5=8) and 5 (GS 9-10). Biochemical recurrence was defined as two consecutive post-RP prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of >0.2 ng/mL after post-RP PSA reaching the nadir of <0.1 ng/mL.  Results:   Our data showed that Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant differences in biochemical recurrence within Gleason GG based on either biopsy or prostatectomy scoring. Multivariate analysis further confirmed that a higher GG was significantly associated with risk of biochemical recurrence. This GG system had a higher prognostic discrimination for both initial biopsy and RP than GS.

As standard CT-based post-implant dosimetry often correlates poorly with late treatment-related toxicity, this exploratory (proof of concept) study was conducted to investigate correlations between radiation - induced DNA damage biomarker levels, and acute and late bowel, urinary, and sexual toxicity.  Methods:   Twelve patients treated with 125I PPB monotherapy (145Gy) for prostate cancer were included in this prospective study. Post-implant CT based dosimetry assessed the minimum dose encompassing 90% (D90%) of the whole prostate volume (global), sub-regions of the prostate (12 sectors) and the near maximum doses (D0.1cc, D2cc) for the rectum and bladder. Six blood samples were collected from each patient; pre-treatment, 1 h (h), 4 h, 24 h post-implant, at 4 weeks (w) and at 3 months (m). DNA double strand breaks were investigated by staining the blood samples with immunofluorescence antibodies to γH2AX and 53BP1 proteins (γH2AX/53BP1). Patient self-scored quality of life from the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) were obtained at baseline, 1 m, 3 m, 6 m, 9 m, 1 year (y), 2y and 3y post-treatment.

Population mean prostate D90% was 144.6 ± 12.1 Gy and rectal near maximum dose D0.1cc = 153.0 ± 30.8 Gy and D2cc = 62.7 ± 12.1 Gy and for the bladder D0.1cc = 123.1 ± 27.0 Gy and D2cc = 70.9 ± 11.9 Gy. Changes in EPIC scores from baseline showed high positive correlation between acute toxicity and late toxicity for both urinary and bowel symptoms. Increased production of γH2AX/53BP1 at 24 h relative to baseline positively correlated with late bowel symptoms. Overall, no correlations were observed between dose metrics (prostate global or sector doses) and γH2AX/53BP1 foci counts.  Conclusions:   Our results show that a prompt increase in γH2AX/53BP1foci at 24 h post-implant relative to baseline may be a useful measure to assess elevated risk of late RT - related toxicities for PPB patients. A subsequent investigation recruiting a larger cohort of patients is warranted to verify our findings.""","""['Sarah O S Osman', 'Simon Horn', 'Darren Brady', 'Stephen J McMahon', 'Ahamed B Mohamed Yoosuf', 'Darren Mitchell', 'Karen Crowther', 'Ciara A Lyons', 'Alan R Hounsell', 'Kevin M Prise', 'Conor K McGarry', 'Suneil Jain', ""Joe M O'Sullivan""]""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Sector analysis provides additional spatial information on the permanent prostate brachytherapy learning curve.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy as a monotherapy for favorable-risk prostate cancer: a Phase II trial.', 'Rectal dose constraints for salvage iodine-125 prostate brachytherapy.', 'Review on the effectiveness of prostate cancer brachytherapy.', 'Importance of post-implant dosimetry in permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Celiac plexus block combined with 125I seeds for refractory epigastric pain from abdominal malignancies: a retrospective case-control study.', 'Prostate Cancer Survivors Present Long-Term, Residual Systemic Immune Alterations.', '125I seed implantation brachytherapy for glottic carcinoma: an experimental and clinical study.']"""

To enable needle insertion into the prostate with the patient in the MR bore, a single needle MR-compatible robotic system involving needle-by-needle dose delivery has been developed at our institution. Throughout the intervention, dose delivery may be impaired by: (1) sub-optimal needle positioning caused by e.g. needle bending, (2) intra-operative internal organ motion such as prostate rotations or swelling, or intra-procedural rectum or bladder filling. This may result in failure to reach clinical constraints. To assess the first aforementioned challenge, a recent study from our research group demonstrated that the deposited dose may be greatly improved by real-time adaptive planning with feedback on the actual needle positioning. However, the needle insertion sequence is left to the doctor and therefore, this may result in sub-optimal dose delivery. In this manuscript, a new method is proposed to determine and update automatically the needle insertion sequence. This strategy is based on the determination of the most sensitive needle track. The sensitivity of a needle track is defined as its impact on the dose distribution in case of sub-optimal positioning. A stochastic criterion is thus presented to determine each needle track sensitivity based on needle insertion simulations. To assess the proposed sequencing strategy, HDR prostate brachytherapy was simulated on 11 patients with varying number of needle insertions. Sub-optimal needle positioning was simulated at each insertion (modeled by typical random angulation errors). In 91% of the scenarios, the dose distribution improved when the needle was inserted into the most compared to the least sensitive needle track. The computation time for sequencing was less than 6 s per needle track. The proposed needle insertion sequencing can therefore assist in delivering an optimal dose in HDR prostate brachytherapy.""","""['M Borot de Battisti', 'B Denis de Senneville', 'G Hautvast', 'D Binnekamp', 'J J W Lagendijk', 'M Maenhout', 'M A Moerland']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Adaptive planning strategy for high dose rate prostate brachytherapy—a simulation study on needle positioning errors.', 'An automated optimization tool for high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy with divergent needle pattern.', 'Fiber Bragg gratings-based sensing for real-time needle tracking during MR-guided brachytherapy.', 'AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy: report of Task Group 192.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'A Platform Integrating Acquisition, Reconstruction, Visualization, and Manipulator Control Modules for MRI-Guided Interventions.']"""

In this work, we report a separation method that achieves the challenging separation of the physically and chemically identical nuclear isomers, 177mLu and 177Lu.

In this study, we find that the ELF5 is frequently expressed in AR activated PCa cells, where it binds to AR acting as a physiological partner and negatively regulates its transcriptional activity. In addition, the interaction between ELF5 and AR is androgen-dependent. Downregulation of ELF5 by shRNA increases the expression of AR-response genes and the progression of PCa. Moreover, ELF5 is a AR-dependent gene that its expression can be induced by androgen and suppressed by antiandrogen treatment.

Material and Methods Thirty-three cancer and 29 SH lesions in the TZ of 54 patients undergoing preoperative DWI (b-value 0, 1000 s/mm2) were analyzed. All the lesions on the MR images were localized based on histopathologic correlations. The 10th, 25th, and 50th percentiles, and the mean ADC values were calculated for the two tissues and compared. The efficiencies of the 10th, 25th, and 50th ADC percentiles in differentiating the two tissues were compared with that of the mean ADC with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results The 10th, 25th, and 50th percentiles and mean ADC values (×10-3 mm2/s) were 0.86 ± 0.15, 0.89 ± 0.16, 0.94 ± 0.16, and 1.03 ± 0.17 in SH and 0.64 ± 0.12, 0.69 ± 0.12, 0.72 ± 0.16, and 0.83 ± 0.15 in TZ cancer, respectively. The parameters were all significantly lower in cancer than SH. The 10th ADC percentile yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.87 for the differentiation of carcinomas from SH, which was higher than the mean ADC (0.80) ( P < 0.05), and the AUCs of the 25th (0.82) and 50th (0.83) percentiles exhibited no differences from those of the mean ADC ( P > 0.05).

L""","""Background:   The incidence and mortalities from cancers remain on the rise worldwide. Despite significant efforts to discover and develop novel anticancer agents, many cancers remain in the unmet need category. As such, efforts to discover and develop new and more effective and less toxic agents against cancer remain a top global priority. Our drug discovery approach is natural products based with a focus on plants. Tillandsia recurvata (L.) L. is one of the plants selected by our research team for further studies based on previous bioactivity findings on the anticancer activity of this plant.  Methods:   The plant biomass was extracted using supercritical fluid extraction technology with CO2 as the mobile phase. Bioactivity guided isolation was achieved by use of chromatographic technics combined with anti-proliferative assays to determine the active fraction and subsequently the pure compound. Following in house screening, the identified molecule was submitted to the US National Cancer Institute for screening on the NCI60 cell line panel using standard protocols. Effect of HLBT-100 on apoptosis, caspase 3/7, cell cycle and DNA fragmentation were assessed using standard protocols. Antiangiogenic activity was carried out using the ex vivo rat aortic ring assay.  Results:   A flavonoid of the flavanone class was isolated from T. recurvata (L.) L. with potent anticancer activity. The molecule was code named as HLBT-100 (also referred to as HLBT-001). The compound inhibited brain cancer (U87 MG), breast cancer (MDA-MB231), leukemia (MV4-11), melanoma (A375), and neuroblastoma (IMR-32) with IC50 concentrations of 0.054, 0.030, 0.024, 0.003 and 0.05 µM, respectively. The molecule also exhibited broad anticancer activity in the NCI60 panel inhibiting especially hematological, colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, breast and prostate cancers. Twenty-three of the NCI60 cell lines were inhibited with GI50 values <0.100 µM. In terms of potential mechanisms of action, the molecule demonstrated effect on the cell cycle as evidenced by the accumulation of cells with <G1 DNA content, activation of caspase 3/7, DNA fragmentation and culminating in apoptotic cell death. HLBT-100 also demonstrated antiangiogenic potential by inhibiting capillary sprout and tube formation in a dose dependent manner in the ex vivo rat aortic ring.  Conclusion:   This paper describes for the first time the anticancer activity of HLBT-100 isolated from T. recurvate (L.) L. The broad and selective anticancer activity of HLBT-100 as evidenced by its potent activity against IMR-32, CNS cancer cell line while not active against neuro-2a, a normal CNS cell line. The activity demonstrated by HLBT-100 in these studies makes the molecule a potential candidate for further development targeting especially those cancers that remain in the unmet need category such as glioblastoma multiforme and acute myeloid leukemia in addition to other cancers.""","""['Henry I C Lowe', 'Ngeh J Toyang', 'Charah T Watson', 'Kenneth N Ayeah', 'Joseph Bryant']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Cell Int""","""['In Vitro Anticancer Activity of the Crude Extract and two Dicinnamate Isolates from the Jamaican Ball Moss (Tillandsia Recurvata L.).', 'In vitro and in vivo anti-cancer effects of tillandsia recurvata (ball moss) from Jamaica.', 'Antileukemic activity of Tillandsia recurvata and some of its cycloartanes.', 'ML264: An Antitumor Agent that Potently and Selectively Inhibits Krüppel-like Factor Five (KLF5) Expression: A Probe for Studying Colon Cancer Development and Progression.', 'Rationally designed anti-mitotic agents with pro-apoptotic activity.', 'Phytochemicals and bioactive compounds effective against acute myeloid leukemia: A systematic review.', 'Natural Products as Anticancer Agents: Current Status and Future Perspectives.', 'Tillandsia usneoides Extract Decreases the Primary Tumor in a Murine Breast Cancer Model but Not in Melanoma.', 'Isolation and Identification of Flavones Responsible for the Antibacterial Activities of Tillandsia bergeri Extracts.', 'Phytochemicals in Prostate Cancer: From Bioactive Molecules to Upcoming Therapeutic Agents.']"""

T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are essential in PI-RADS, depending partly on visual assessment of signal intensity, while dynamic-contrast enhanced imaging is less important. To decrease inter-rater variability and further standardize image evaluation, complementary objective measures are in need.  Methods:   We here demonstrate a sequence enabling simultaneous quantification of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2-relaxation, as well as calculation of the perfusion fraction f from low b-value intravoxel incoherent motion data. Expandable wait pulses were added to a FOCUS DW SE-EPI sequence, allowing the effective echo time to change at run time. To calculate both ADC and f, b-values 200s/mm2 and 600s/mm2 were chosen, and for T2-estimation 6 echo times between 64.9ms and 114.9ms were used.  Results:   Three patients with prostate cancer were examined and all had significantly decreased ADC and T2-values, while f was significantly increased in 2 of 3 tumors. T2 maps obtained in phantom measurements and in a healthy volunteer were compared to T2 maps from a SE sequence with consecutive scans, showing good agreement. In addition, a motion correction procedure was implemented to reduce the effects of prostate motion, which improved T2-estimation.

The present study is the first population-based analysis using conventional multivariable analyses as well as propensity score matching to assess this relationship.  Methods:   Overall, 77,484 patients after resection of localized or locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 1973 and 2012 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry. The occurrence of secondary malignancies diagnosed at least 1 (median follow up 5.8years [1-39.9years]) year after rectal cancer diagnosis was compared in patients who did and did not undergo radiation using stratified and propensity score matched Cox regression analysis.  Results:   Of 77,484 patients, 34,114 underwent radiation and 43,370 did not. Ignoring gender and entity, radiation therapy was not associated with secondary malignancies (hazard ratio [HR]=0.97 (95%CI: 0.92-1.02, P=0.269). The risk for prostate cancer was decreased and (HR=0.42, 95%CI: 0.36-0.48, P<0.001) and increased risk for endometrial cancer (HR=1.95, 95%CI: 1.49-2.56, P<0.001). Overall, patients undergoing radiation had higher risks for lung cancer (HR=1.18, 95%CI: 1.06-1.30, P<0.001), bladder cancer (HR=1.54, 95%CI: 1.31-1.80, P<0.001) and lymphomas (HR=1.27, 95%CI: 1.03-1.58, P=0.026).  Conclusions:   The present analysis describes the occurence of secondary malignancies after pelvic radiation in patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery. Indeed, radiation for rectal cancer is associated with a significantly decreased risk of prostate cancer, however, an increased risk of endometrial, lung, and bladder cancer as well as lymphomas was observed. Overall, the risk of secondary malignancies was slightly decreased with radiation in patients undergoing rectal cancer resection, this was attributable to lower rates in prostate cancer.""","""['Rene Warschkow', 'Ulrich Güller', 'Thomas Cerny', 'Bruno Martin Schmied', 'Ludwig Plasswilm', 'Paul Martin Putora']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['The impact of age at the time of radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer on the development of second primary malignancies.', 'Long-term Risk of Urinary Adverse Events in Curatively Treated Patients With Rectal Cancer: A Population-Based Analysis.', 'The influence of local therapy on the survival of patients with metastatic rectal cancer: a population-based, propensity-matched study.', 'Secondary Cancers After Radiation Therapy for Primary Prostate or Rectal Cancer.', 'Second malignancies after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Risk prediction of second primary malignancies after gynecological malignant neoplasms resection with and without radiation therapy: a population-based surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) analysis.', 'Clinical characteristics analysis and prognostic nomogram for predicting survival in patients with second primary prostate cancer: a population study based on SEER database.', 'Risk and prognosis of secondary malignant neoplasms after radiation therapy for bladder cancer: A large population-based cohort study.', 'Risk and prognosis of second corpus uteri cancer after radiation therapy for pelvic cancer: A population-based analysis.', 'Risk and prognosis of secondary bladder cancer after radiation therapy for pelvic cancer.']"""

The median cancer-specific survival of patients with prostatic small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is 19 months, and 60.5% of the patients have metastatic disease. Neural development transcription factors are molecules involved in the organogenesis of the central nervous system and of neuroendocrine precursors of various tissues, including the suprarenal gland, thyroid glands, lungs and prostate.  Material and methods:   We present 3 cases of this uncommon condition, applying the new World Health Organisation criteria. We conducted studies through haematoxylin and eosin staining and analysed the expression of the neural development transcription factors achaete-scute homolog like 1, thyroid transcription factor 1 and the class III/IV POU transcription factors, as a new research line in the carcinogenesis of prostatic neuroendocrine tumours.  Results:   In case 1, there was no TTF1 immunoexpression. Cases 2 and 3 had positive immunostaining for ASCL1, and Case 1 had negative immunostaining.

Patients and methods:   Epidemiological, population-based, study including a national representative sample of 3,918 incident patients with histopathological confirmation during 2010; 95% of the patient's sample was followed up for at least one year. Diagnosis along with treatment related variables (for localized PCa -low, intermediate, high and locally-advanced by D'Amico risk stratification) was recorded. Differences between groups were tested with Chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests.  Results:   Mean (SD) age of PCa patients was 68.48 (8.18). Regarding diagnostic by biopsy procedures, 64.56% of all patients had 8-12 cores in first biopsy and 46.5% of the patients over 75 years, with PSA<10ng/mL were biopsied. Staging by Computer Tomography (CT) or Bone Scan (BS) was used for determining tumor extension in 60.09% of high-risk cases and was applied differentially depending on patients' age; 3,293 (84.05%) patients received a treatment for localized PCa. Radical prostatectomy was done in 1,277 patients and 206 out of these patients also had a lymphadenectomy, being 4.64% low-risk, 22.81% intermediate-risk and 36.00% high-risk patients; 86.08% of 1,082 patients who had radiotherapy were treated with 3D or IMRT and 35.77% received a dose ≥75Gy; 419 patients were treated with brachytherapy (BT): 54.81% were low-risk patients, 22.84% intermediate-risk and 12.98% high-risk. Hormonotherapy (HT, n=521) was applied as single therapy in 9.46% of low-risk and 17.92% of intermediate-risk patients. Additionally, HT was combined with RT in 14.34% of lower-risk patients and 58.26% of high-risk patients, and 67.19% low-intermediate risk with RT and/or BT received neoadjuvant/concomitant/adjuvant HT. Finally, 83.75% of high-risk patients undergoing RT and/or BT also received HT.  Conclusions:   Although EAU guidelines for PCa management are easily available in Europe, the adherence to their recommendations is low, finding the highest discrepancies in the need for a prostate biopsy and the diagnostic methods. Improve information and educational programs could allow a higher adherence to the guidelines and reduce the variability in daily practice.

This phenomenon is well established in the scientific literature. The normal parenchymal smooth muscle phenotype switches to a myofibroblastic phenotype in response to the presence of cancer cells, with an expansion of the extracellular matrix compartment. The amount of reactive stroma is a predictor of biochemical recurrence in both radical prostatectomies and biopsies. It is a predictor of prostate cancer-specific death in prostatectomies. The aim of this study is to improve our histologic understanding of reactive stroma in prostate cancer and to determine the histologic features of the malignant epithelium found in stromogenic carcinomas or carcinomas with reactive stromal grade 3. Tissue microarrays of 800 patients and hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of 120 radical prostatectomies, previously determined to contain a high proportion of areas with stromogenic carcinoma, were evaluated and findings systematically recorded. We identified 3 histologic patterns of reactive stroma: extracellular matrix-rich, cellular variant and edematous/myxoid variant. The most common pattern of carcinoma in stromogenic areas is of the acinar type with angulated glands and periglandular halos. The nuclei are enlarged, opened, with prominent nucleoli. Luminal borders are undulated, and amorphous pink secretion is often seen. Perineural invasion is frequently identified. Because of the clinical relevance, identification and quantification of areas with high reactive stromal grade by pathologists and reproducibility of our findings by others become essential. We believe that with the previously proposed grading system and the present morphologic description, both can be achieved.""","""['Andrea Diaz De Vivar', 'Mohammad Sayeeduddin', 'David Rowley', 'Antonio Cubilla', 'Brian Miles', 'Dov Kadmon', 'Gustavo Ayala']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Stromogenic prostatic carcinoma pattern (carcinomas with reactive stromal grade 3) in needle biopsies predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'Reprint of: Stromogenic prostatic carcinoma pattern (carcinomas with reactive stromal grade 3) in needle biopsies predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'Determining prostate cancer-specific death through quantification of stromogenic carcinoma area in prostatectomy specimens.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Moving Beyond Gleason Scoring.', 'Association between Expression of Connective Tissue Genes and Prostate Cancer Growth and Progression.', 'Stromal FAP Expression is Associated with MRI Visibility and Patient Survival in Prostate Cancer.', 'In\u2009situ expression of ERG protein in the context of tumor heterogeneity identifies prostate cancer patients with inferior prognosis.', 'Integrins and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Cooperation in the Tumor Microenvironment of Muscle-Invasive Lethal Cancers.', 'Development and validation of a quantitative reactive stroma biomarker (qRS) for prostate cancer prognosis.']"""

The goal of this study was to determine whether abituzumab (DI17E6, EMD 525797), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) against integrin αV impacts, prostate cancer progression. To evaluate this, prostate cancer cells were treated with DI17E6 and its effects on proliferation, apoptosis, cell-cycle, adhesion, detachment, migration, invasion and phosphorylation of downstream targets, including FAK, Akt, and ERK, were determined. DI17E6 promoted detachment and inhibited adhesion of prostate cancer cells to several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and cells found in the bone microenvironment but had no impact on cell viability, cell-cycle, and caspase-3/7 activity. DI17E6 inhibited migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells. In addition, DI7E6 decreased phosphorylation of FAK, Akt, and ERK. These results indicate that inhibition of integrin αV with DI17E6 inhibits several prometastatic phenotypes of prostate cancer cells and therefore provide a rationale for further evaluation of DI17E6 for diminishing prostate cancer progression.Implications: This work identifies that therapeutic targeting of integrins containing an αV integrin unit inhibits cancer progression and thus may be of clinical benefit.

Background:   Androgen receptor (AR) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling are two commonly perturbed pathways in prostate cancer. Preclinical data have shown that the two pathways compensate for each other when one is inhibited, and combined inhibition of AR and PI3K signaling may be a viable strategy to prevent or overcome castration resistance.  Methods:   This phase I study evaluated the safety and tolerability of abiraterone acetate and prednisone combined with BEZ235, a dual PI3K and mTORC1/2 inhibitor, in men with progressive metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have not received prior chemotherapy.  Results:   Six patients (n = 6) were treated at the starting dose level of abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg with prednisone 5 mg twice daily and BEZ235 200 mg twice daily in a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. The study was terminated early because three of the six patients (50%) experienced dose-limiting toxicities: grade 3 mucositis, grade 3 hypotension, and grade 4 dyspnea and pneumonitis. All six patients had previously progressed on abiraterone/prednisone. The median treatment duration was 27 days (range: 3-130 days). No prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline or objective response were observed.  Conclusion:   The combination of standard-dose abiraterone/prednisone with BEZ235 200 mg twice daily was poorly tolerated in patients with mCRPC. The on-target and off-target effects of dual PI3K and mTORC inhibition likely contributed to the unacceptable toxicity profile.

We investigated clinical outcomes associated with subsequent abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (55 patients) and enzalutamide (33 patients) in a post hoc analysis of COU-AA-302. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was assessed. Median time to PSA progression was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The PSA response rate (≥50% PSA decline, unconfirmed) was 44% and 67%, respectively. The median time to PSA progression was 3.9 mo (range 2.6-not estimable) for subsequent abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and 2.8 mo (range 1.8-not estimable) for subsequent enzalutamide. The majority of patients (68%) received intervening chemotherapy before subsequent abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or enzalutamide. While acknowledging the limitations of post hoc analyses and high censoring (>75%) in both treatment groups, these results suggest that subsequent therapy with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or enzalutamide for patients who progressed on abiraterone acetate is associated with limited clinical benefit.

This clinical scenario has been evaluated within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.  Materials and methods:   The SEER-9 database (1973-2013) was queried using the SEER*Stat program to determine the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of kidney cancer development following each one of 10 common invasive malignancies (colorectal, breast, prostate, lung, thyroid, corpus uteri, urinary bladder, kidney/renal pelvis, cutaneous melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma). The following data were collected for patients with a second renal cancer: age at diagnosis of the second renal cancer; gender, race, and histology of the second primary renal cancer; SEER historic stage of the second primary renal cancer; and method of diagnostic confirmation of the second primary cancer.  Results:   A total of 10,145 kidney cancers were observed. Elevated SIRs for kidney cancer were noted for all 10 evaluated malignancies in the initial 12 months after diagnosis. The SIRs remained elevated 12 to 59 months after diagnosis for all cancers except breast and prostate cancers. Increased risks persisted 60 to 119 months beyond diagnosis for renal cancer (SIR, 4.13), thyroid cancer (SIR, 2.30), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 1.40); and 120+ months for renal cancer (SIR, 3.60), thyroid cancer (SIR, 1.90), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 1.27). Increased kidney cancer risk after non-Hodgkin lymphoma was not related to radiation therapy. Papillary renal cell carcinoma has the highest SIRs for subsequent kidney cancers.  Conclusion:   Many common cancers are associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer development within the first 5 years after their diagnosis. Although this can be partly interpreted by increased rates of surveillance tests, radiotherapy effects, or genetic associations for some cancers, additional research is required to explain the persistently increased risk beyond 5 years associated with some cancers.""","""['Omar Abdel-Rahman']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Risk of subsequent primary thyroid cancer after another malignancy: latency trends in a population-based study.', 'Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer as a Second Primary Among Patients With Previous Malignancy: Who Is at Risk?', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Risk of second non-breast cancer among patients treated with and without postoperative radiotherapy for primary breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies including 522,739 patients.', 'Second primary malignancy risk in thyroid cancer survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Thyroid and renal cancers: A bidirectional association.', 'A comprehensive analysis of renal cell carcinoma as first and second primary cancers.', 'Second Primary Renal Cell Carcinoma With Nonrenal Malignancies: An Analysis of 118 Cases and a Review of Literature.', 'Second Primary Malignancy in Patients with Hypopharyngeal Carcinoma: A SEER-Based Study.', 'Second primary malignancy in patients with cholangiocarcinoma: a population-based study.']"""

Here we show that overexpression of the AR NTD to generate decoy molecules inhibited both the growth and progression of prostate cancer in castrated hosts. Specifically, it was shown that lentivirus delivery of decoys delayed hormonal progression in castrated hosts as indicated by increased doubling time of tumor volume, prolonged time to achieve pre-castrate levels of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA nadir. These clinical parameters are indicative of delayed hormonal progression and improved therapeutic response and prognosis. Decoys reduced the expression of androgen-regulated genes that correlated with reduced in situ interaction of the AR with androgen response elements. Decoys did not reduce levels of AR protein or prevent nuclear localization of the AR. Nor did decoys interact directly with the AR. Thus decoys did not inhibit AR transactivation by a dominant negative mechanism.

Current practice is to insert an indwelling catheter (IDC) during CT to assist with visualisation of the urethra and subsequently minimise dose to this highly critical structure. However, this procedure is invasive and has an associated risk of infection. This is a case study, which demonstrates our initial experience of using a real-time non-invasive MRI technique to replace the use of IDC for prostate cancer patients. The patient was scanned on a dedicated 3T MRI and was instructed to micturate in their own time whereupon a sagittal T2 weighted HASTE sequence was acquired every 5 s. This was subsequently followed by T2 weighted axial imaging at the level of mid prostate to provide improved urethral definition. Acquired images showed bladder voidance in real-time and an increase in signal intensity in the proximal urethra post voiding allowing for delineation of the urethra. The dimension and shape of the proximal urethra was well visualised and accumulation time of urine in the urethra was sufficient to enable optimum timing of the scanning technique.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on planned dose distribution and delineated structures for prostate patients, originating from this distortion. A method was developed, in which computer tomography (CT) images were distorted using the MRI distortion field. The displacement map for an optimized MRI treatment planning sequence was measured using a dedicated phantom in a 3 T MRI system. To simulate the distortion aspects of a synthetic CT (electron density derived from MR images), the displacement map was applied to CT images, referred to as distorted CT images. A volumetric modulated arc prostate treatment plan was applied to the original CT and the distorted CT, creating a reference and a distorted CT dose distribution. By applying the inverse of the displacement map to the distorted CT dose distribution, a dose distribution in the same geometry as the original CT images was created. For 10 prostate cancer patients, the dose difference between the reference dose distribution and inverse distorted CT dose distribution was analyzed in isodose level bins. The mean magnitude of the geometric distortion was 1.97 mm for the radial distance of 200-250 mm from isocenter. The mean percentage dose differences for all isodose level bins, were ⩽0.02% and the radiotherapy structure mean volume deviations were <0.2%. The method developed can quantify the dosimetric effects of MRI system specific distortion in a prostate MRI only radiotherapy workflow, separated from dosimetric effects originating from synthetic CT generation. No clinically relevant dose difference or structure deformation was found when 3D distortion correction and high acquisition bandwidth was used.

A detailed investigation on the influence of embelin on epithelial malignancy model system, especially colon adenocarcinoma, is lacking. The objective of the current study is to investigate the antiproliferative, antiinvasive and proapoptotic potential of embelin on colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29. Methods The effect of embelin (35 µg/mL for 24 h) on cell proliferation was assessed by Sulforhodamine B assay and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation test, antiinvasive effect by Boyden chamber assay and scratch assay. Proapoptotic effects of embelin were determined by studies on DNA fragmentation, annexin V-FITC labeling, TUNEL assay, COMET assay and assay of caspase-3 activity. Influence of embelin on the expression of genes regulating apoptosis (caspase 3 and 9, Bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome C and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) and migration/invasion (matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-2 and MMP-9) was investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Further, the effect of embelin on the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxides, nitric oxide, mitochondrial membrane potential and antioxidant status (total reduced glutathione [GSH] and GSH-S-transferase) was evaluated. Results Results implicated that embelin treatment inhibited proliferation (IC50 35 µg/mL), induced DNA fragmentation, phosphatidyl serine externalization, increased caspase expression, decreased cell migration and expression of MMPs in HT-29 cells. Interestingly, embelin exhibited prooxidant effect on HT-29 cells and induced excessive ROS generation resulting in apoptotic cell death.

In contrast, tumor-invaded bone exhibits a disorganized, less-aligned microstructure that results in severely disrupted mechanical function. Despite its importance both in basic principle and in therapeutic applications, the classical understanding of bone metastasis is limited to alterations in bone mass regulated by metastatic cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrate a novel mechanism underlying the disruption of bone tissue anisotropy in metastasized bone. We observed that direct attack by cancer cells on osteoblasts induces the less-organized osteoblast arrangement. Importantly, the crystallographic anisotropy of bone tissue is quantitatively determined by the level of osteoblast arrangement. Osteoblast arrangement was significantly disrupted by physical contact with cancer cells such as osteolytic melanoma B16F10, breast cancer MDA-MB-231, and osteoblastic prostate cancer MDA-PCa-2b cells. The present findings demonstrate that the abnormal arrangement of osteoblasts induced by physical contact with cancer cells facilitates the disorganized microstructure of metastasized bone.""","""['Yumi Kimura', 'Aira Matsugaki', 'Aiko Sekita', 'Takayoshi Nakano']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Dynamic Collision Behavior Between Osteoblasts and Tumor Cells Regulates the Disordered Arrangement of Collagen Fiber/Apatite Crystals in Metastasized Bone.', 'Impaired Alignment of Bone Matrix Microstructure Associated with Disorganized Osteoblast Arrangement in Malignant Melanoma Metastasis.', 'Prostate cancer cells induce osteoblast differentiation through a Cbfa1-dependent pathway.', 'Basic mechanisms responsible for osteolytic and osteoblastic bone metastases.', 'Endothelial Cells as Precursors for Osteoblasts in the Metastatic Prostate Cancer Bone.', 'An insight into cancer palaeobiology: does the Mesozoic neoplasm support tissue organization field theory of tumorigenesis?', 'Wnt signaling: a double-edged sword in protecting bone from cancer.', 'Directing Multicellular Organization by Varying the Aspect Ratio of Soft Hydrogel Microwells.', 'Novel bone microenvironment model of castration-resistant prostate cancer with chitosan fiber matrix and osteoblasts.', 'Superior Alignment of Human iPSC-Osteoblasts Associated with Focal Adhesion Formation Stimulated by Oriented Collagen Scaffold.']"""

Following the recent introduction of end-firing lithium triborate lasers, we have created a new technique called photoselective vaporesection of the prostate (PVRP). This study described our initial experience using the PVRP technique for the treatment of BPH.  Methods:   This prospective study included a total of 35 patients with BPH who underwent PVRP from August 2013 to July 2014. The chief clinical parameters were obtained and evaluated during the perioperative period and follow-up, including the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QoL) score, maximum urinary flow rate, and prostate volume. All variables were evaluated for statistically significant differences compared to baseline values using the analysis of variance.  Results:   The mean subgroup IPSS and QoL scores significantly improved during follow-up; the respective decreases in IPSS storage score, IPSS voiding score, IPSS nocturia score, and QoL score were 75.3%, 83.6%, 51.4%, and 71.7%, respectively (all P < 0.001 compared with baseline).

Material and methods:   Information was derived from patients participating in the LAPAroscopic Prostatectomy Robot Open (LAPPRO) trial, Sweden. We analyzed the association between self-assessed emotional shock upon diagnosis and psychological well-being by calculating odds ratios (ORs).  Results:   A total of 2426 patients (75%) reported self-assessed emotional shock by the prostate cancer diagnosis. Median age of study participants was 63. There was an association between emotional shock and low psychological well-being after surgery: adjusted OR 1.7: (95% confidence interval [CI]), 1.4-2.1 at 3 months; adjusted OR 1.3: CI, 1.1-1.7 at 12 months, and adjusted OR 1.4: CI, 1.1-1.8 at 24 months. Among self-assessed emotionally shocked patients, low self-esteem, anxiety, and having no one to confide in were factors more strongly related with low psychological well-being over time.  Conclusion:   Experiencing self-assessed emotional shock by prostate cancer diagnosis may be associated with low psychological well-being for up to two years after surgery.

Methods:   We used data from a cohort study of 1064 men with localized prostate cancer recruited between 2005 and 2007 by 24 urologists across 10 sites in Queensland, Australia (ProsCan). We estimated the MBS and PBS costs attributable to prostate cancer from the date of initial appointment to 12 months after diagnosis in 2013 Australian dollars using a comparison group without prostate cancer. We used generalized linear modeling to identify key determinants of higher treatment-related costs.  Results:   From the date of initial appointment to 12 months postdiagnosis, the average MBS costs attributable to prostate cancer were $9,357 (SD $191) per patient. These MBS costs were most sensitive to having private health insurance and the type of primary treatment received. The PBS costs were higher in the control group than in the ProsCan group ($5,641 vs $1,924).  Conclusions:   The costs of treating and managing prostate cancer are high and these result in a substantial financial burden for the Australian MBS. Costs attributable to prostate cancer appear to vary widely based on initial treatment and these are likely to increase with the introduction of more expensive services and pharmaceuticals.

Methods: PCa patients (n = 105) with an increased risk of LN involvement (LNI) underwent pelvic 99mTc-trofolastat SPECT/CT before radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic LN dissection. The sensitivity of 99mTc-trofolastat for detection of PCa on a patient and lobe basis, using visual and semiquantitative (tumor-to-background ratio [TBR]) scores, and of LNI was evaluated as well as the correlation of uptake within the gland to Gleason scores (GS) and assessment of the predictive potential of 99mTc-trofolastat uptake for LNI. Results: PCa was detected in 98 patients (94%) with acceptable variability between readers. There was a significantly higher visual score and TBR in positive lobes compared with tumor-negative lobes. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that visual scores more accurately discriminated lobes with GS ≤ 3 + 3 from ≥ 3 + 4, whereas TBRs discriminated high-grade disease from normal lobes better.

Methods:11C-radiolabeled sarcosine was tested as a new PET imaging probe in comparison with 11C-choline in 2 prostate cancer tumor xenograft models (DU-145 and PC-3). We characterized 11C-sarcosine transport in PC-3 and LNCaP tumor cells and performed 11C-sarcosine PET with CT in the first human subject with localized Gleason 4 + 3 prostate cancer. Target metabolite analyses of sarcosine and its natural precursors, glycine and choline, were performed from independent human prostate tissues. Results: In vitro assays indicated blockage of 11C-sarcosine uptake into PC-3 and LNCaP tumor cells by excess unlabeled (cold) sarcosine. 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, but not 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid, competitively inhibited 11C-sarcosine tumor cell uptake, confirming PAT-mediated transport.

In prostate cancer, EMP has been associated with both suppression and activation of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Here we investigated the effect of the potent AR antagonist enzalutamide on EMP in multiple preclinical models of prostate cancer and patient tissues. Enzalutamide treatment significantly enhanced the expression of EMP drivers (ZEB1, ZEB2, Snail, Twist, and FOXC2) and mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, fibronectin, and vimentin) in prostate cancer cells, enhanced prostate cancer cell migration, and induced prostate cancer transformation to a spindle, fibroblast-like morphology. Enzalutamide-induced EMP required concomitant suppression of AR signaling and activation of the EMP-promoting transcription factor Snail, as evidenced by both knockdown and overexpression studies. Supporting these findings, AR signaling and Snail expression were inversely correlated in C4-2 xenografts, patient-derived castration-resistant metastases, and clinical samples. For the first time, we elucidate a mechanism explaining the inverse relationship between AR and Snail. Specifically, we found that AR directly repressed SNAI1 gene expression by binding to specific AR-responsive elements within the SNAI1 promoter. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that de-repression of Snail and induction of EMP is an adaptive response to enzalutamide with implications for therapy resistance.

The aim of this work was to determine the risk of second primary cancers (SPC) in the organs distal to the prostate during 3D conformal radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   Based on previously measured peripheral photon and neutron doses in a Rando phantom using an 18MV photon beam, SPC risks in the out-of-field organs were estimated using the linear-no-threshold and the competitive risk models. Whole body as well as organ specific risk coefficients were used to calculate the SPC risks in order to estimate upper and lower risk limits, given the uncertainties associated with the coefficients.  Results:   The corresponding estimated average SPC risks ranged from 1.5±0.3% for thyroid to 4.5±4.2% for colon using whole body risk coefficients and 0.12±0.03% and 1.45±1.34%, respectively, using organ specific risk coefficients. The linear-no-threshold and the competitive risk models resulted in the same risk estimates (within the estimated errors) in the dose range received by out-of-field organs (≤1Gy). Distally located organs such as lungs, oesophagus, and thyroid received higher neutron versus photon dose.

The objectives of this study were to compare their early adoption patterns and identify factors associated with their use.  Methods:   By using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, patients who received radiation therapy during the 5 years after IMRT introduction (2001-2005) and the 5 years after SBRT introduction (2007-2011) were identified. The outcome of interest was the receipt of new radiation therapy (ie, IMRT or SBRT) compared with the existing standard radiation therapies at that time. The authors fit a series of multivariable, hierarchical logistic regression models accounting for patients nested within health service areas to examine the factors associated with the receipt of new radiation therapy.  Results:   During 2001 to 2005, 5680 men (21%) received IMRT compared with standard radiation (n = 21,555). Men who received IMRT were older, had higher grade tumors, and lived in more populated areas (P < .05). During 2007 through 2011, 595 men (2%) received SBRT compared with standard radiation (n = 28,255). Men who received ng SBRT were more likely to be white, had lower grade tumors, lived in more populated areas, and were more likely to live in the Northeast (P < .05). Adjusting for cohort demographic and clinical factors, the early adoption rate for IMRT was substantially higher than that for SBRT (44% vs 4%; P < .01).  Conclusions:   There is a stark contrast in the adoption rates of IMRT and SBRT at the time of their introduction.

ROs were more likely to prefer lower PSA thresholds for initiating SRT (P<0.0001), and more likely to recommend ART in the setting of adverse pathologic features or node-positive disease (P<0.0001). Significantly more ROs would recommend concurrent androgen deprivation therapy or pelvic nodal RT in the setting of node-positive or Gleason score 8 to 10 disease (P<0.0001).  Conclusions:   Specialty-specific differences were readily elucidated with respect to timing and indications for ART and SRT, as well as for indications for androgen deprivation therapy and nodal RT. These differences are likely to create a sense of dissonance for patients, which may in turn explain the underutilization of postoperative RT in general practice.""","""['Amar U Kishan', 'Gillian Duchesne', 'Pin-Chieh Wang', 'Jean-Claude M Rwigema', 'Arun U Kishan', 'Christopher Saigal', 'Matthew Rettig', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Christopher R King']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Does Specialty Bias Trump Evidence in the Management of High-risk Prostate Cancer?', 'Patterns of Care Related to Post-Operative Radiotherapy for Patients with Prostate Cancer among Canadian Radiation Oncologists and Urologists.', ""Urologists' referral and radiation oncologists' treatment patterns regarding high-risk prostate cancer patients receiving radiotherapy within 6 months after radical prostatectomy: A prospective cohort analysis."", 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Adjuvant vs. salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Interfractional Geometric Variations and Dosimetric Benefits of Stereotactic MRI Guided Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (SMART) of Prostate Bed after Radical Prostatectomy: Post-Hoc Analysis of a Phase II Trial.', 'Trends in prostatectomy utilization: Increasing upfront prostatectomy and postprostatectomy radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'The Prognostic Factors of Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival Following Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Methods:   The biodistribution of 213Bi-labeled small-molecule inhibitor PSMA I&T and nanobody JVZ-008 was evaluated in mice bearing PSMA-positive LNCaP xenografts. DNA damage response was followed using LNCaP cells and LNCaP xenografts.  Results:   In vitro, 213Bi-PSMA I&T and 213Bi-JVZ-008 therapy of LNCaP cells led to increased number of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), detected as 53BP1 and γH2AX nuclear foci. In vivo, tumor uptake of 213Bi-PSMA I&T and 213Bi-JVZ-008 was 5.75% ± 2.70%ID/g (injected dose per gram) and 2.68% ± 0.56%ID/g, respectively, with similar tumor-to-kidney ratios. Furthermore, both agents induced in vivo DSBs in the tumors, which were detected between 1 hour and 24 hours after injection. 213Bi-PSMA I&T induced significantly more DSBs than 213Bi-JVZ-008 (p < 0.01).  Conclusions: 213Bi-PSMA I&T and 213Bi-JVZ-008 showed efficient and rapid tumor targeting and produced DSBs in PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells and xenografts.

Patients and methods:   A total of 34 consecutive men with suspected prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent 3T MRI of the prostate were assessed. MRI included t-DWI and d-DWI (using b-values of 50, 1000, and 1600 s/mm2 , number of averages 1/5/10 for t-DWI vs. 2/8/14 for d-DWI, acquisition time 6:21 min vs. 4:17 min, respectively). Two independent observers evaluated image quality, including image sharpness, anatomic distortion, and artifacts on a 5-point scale (1-5) and assessed tumor detection, conspicuity, and PI-RADS classification with both DWI sequences. eSNR and ADC were measured in the peripheral zone (PZ), transitional zone (TZ), and detected tumors. Data was compared using paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests and McNemar test. Coefficients of variations (CV) between ADC obtained with both sequences were calculated.  Results:   Significantly fewer artifacts were observed on d-DWI at b 1600 for observer 2 (P < 0.01), while the other image quality scores were equivalent for both sequences. eSNR was lower with d-DWI vs. t-DWI in PZ and TZ for b 1000 (P < 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively) and b 1600 (P < 0.01 for both).

Argentina has reached an advanced stage of demographic transition and presents a comparatively high rate of cancer mortality within Latin America. The objectives of this study were to examine cancer mortality trends in the province of Córdoba, Argentina, between 1986 and 2011, and to analyze the differences attributable to risk variations and demographic changes. Longitudinal series of age-standardized mortality rates for overall, breast and prostate cancers were modeled by Joinpoint regression to estimate the annual percent change. The Bashir & Estève method was used to split crude mortality rate variation into three components: mortality risk, population age structure and population size. A decreasing cancer age-standardized mortality rates trend was observed (1986-2011 annual percent change: -1.4, 95%CI: -1.6, -1.2 in men; -0.8, 95%CI: -1.0, -0.6 in women), with a significant shift in 1996. There were positive crude mortality rate net changes for overall female cancer, breast and prostate cancers, which were primarily attributable to demographic changes. Inversely, overall male cancer crude mortality rate showed a 9.15% decrease, mostly due to mortality risk. Despite favorable age-standardized mortality rates trends, the influence of population aging reinforces the challenge to control cancer in populations with an increasingly aged demographic structure.""","""['Sonia Alejandra Pou', 'Natalia Tumas', 'Julia Becaria Coquet', 'Camila Niclis', 'María Dolores Román', 'María Del Pilar Díaz']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cad Saude Publica""","""['Prostate cancer mortality trends in Argentina 1986-2006: an age-period-cohort and joinpoint analysis.', 'Breast cancer mortality trends and patterns in Córdoba, Argentina in the period 1986-2006.', 'Trends in mortality from breast cancer in Córdoba, Argentina, 1986-2011: some socio-historical interpretations.', 'Geographical patterns of cancer mortality in Argentina.', 'The frequency of cancer in France in 2006, mortality trends since 1950, incidence trends since 1980 and analysis of the discrepancies between these trends.', 'Effects of population aging on the mortality burden of related cancers in urban and rural areas of China, 2004-2017: a population-based study.', 'Population ageing and mortality during 1990-2017: A\xa0global decomposition analysis.']"""

In this study, the goal was to demonstrate the involvement and impact of P-Akt1 on cellular interactions, biomechanisms, and pathways in PCa. Tissue microarrays from 640 PCa patients were immunostained with various antibodies. Ki-67 was used to measure proliferation index, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick end labeling was used for apoptotic index. Increased expression of P-Akt1 was associated with an increased proliferation but inversely correlated with apoptotic index. Higher levels of P-Akt1 are associated with both higher levels of cytoplasmic p27 and higher levels of nuclear p27, suggesting an involvement in both cytoplasmic entrapment and phosphorylation of p27. P-Akt1 expression significantly correlated with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of FHKR and GSK. The strongest correlations were found with the P- forms of both, suggesting enzyme kinetics in the latter. Here, phosphorylation is the principal method of FHKR and GSK inactivation. P-Akt1 correlated with nuclear transcription factor kappa B, suggesting a role in the inhibition through phosphorylation of nuclear transcription factor kappa B. The results of the current study are unique because of the scope of the markers and the size of the population used. In vitro- and in vivo-derived information of P-Akt1 and its downstream effectors demonstrates significant involvement in PCa. Our data suggest that PCa uses multiple mechanisms to regulate this pathway and substantiate the concept of redundancy in cancer pathway regulation.

Therefore it is important to determine how variants of ABCG2 affect the transporter function in order to determine whether modified treatment regimens may be necessary for patients harboring ABCG2 variants. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between the ABCG2 Q141K variant and overall survival after a prostate cancer diagnosis. We report here that in patients with recurrent prostate cancer, those who carry the ABCG2 Q141K variant had a significantly shorter time to PSA recurrence post-prostatectomy than patients homozygous for wild-type ABCG2 (P=0.01). Transport studies showed that wild-type ABCG2 was able to efflux more folic acid than the Q141K variant (P<0.002), suggesting that retained tumoral folate contributes to the decreased time to PSA recurrence in the Q141K variant patients. In a seemingly conflicting study, it was previously reported that docetaxel-treated Q141K variant prostate cancer patients have a longer survival time. We found this may be due to less efficient docetaxel efflux in cells with the Q141K variant versus wild-type ABCG2. In human prostate cancer tissues, confocal microscopy revealed that all genotypes had a mixture of cytoplasmic and plasma membrane staining, with noticeably less staining in the two homozygous KK patients. In conclusion, the Q141K variant plays contrasting roles in prostate cancer: 1) by decreasing folate efflux, increased intracellular folate levels result in enhanced tumor cell proliferation and therefore time to recurrence decreases; and 2) in patients treated with docetaxel, by decreasing its efflux, intratumoral docetaxel levels and tumor cell drug sensitivity increase and therefore patient survival time increases. Taken together, these data suggest that a patient's ABCG2 genotype may be important when determining a personalized treatment plan.""","""['Kathryn M Sobek', 'Jessica L Cummings', 'Dean J Bacich', ""Denise S O'Keefe""]""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Single nucleotide polymorphisms modify the transporter activity of ABCG2.', 'Single nucleotide polymorphisms result in impaired membrane localization and reduced atpase activity in multidrug transporter ABCG2.', ""The C421A (Q141K) polymorphism enhances the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR)-dependent regulation of ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2."", 'The frequency of rs2231142 in ABCG2\xa0among Asian subgroups: implications for personalized rosuvastatin dosing.', 'BCRP/ABCG2 and high-alert medications: Biochemical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic, and clinical implications.', 'Cannabis Pharmacogenomics: A Path to Personalized Medicine.', 'Multidrug efflux transporter ABCG2: expression and regulation.', 'Medically Important Alterations in Transport Function and Trafficking of ABCG2.', 'A pharmacogenetics study of platinum-based chemotherapy in lung cancer: ABCG2 polymorphism and its genetic interaction with SLC31A1 are associated with response and survival.', 'High expression of ABCG2 is associated with chemotherapy resistance of osteosarcoma.']"""

It recruits men with high-risk, locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer who were initiating long-term hormone therapy. We report survival data for two celecoxib (Cel)-containing comparisons, which stopped accrual early at interim analysis on the basis of failure-free survival. Patients and Methods Standard of care (SOC) was hormone therapy continuously (metastatic) or for ≥ 2 years (nonmetastatic); prostate (± pelvic node) radiotherapy was encouraged for men without metastases. Cel 400 mg was administered twice a day for 1 year. Zoledronic acid (ZA) 4 mg was administered for six 3-weekly cycles, then 4-weekly for 2 years. Stratified random assignment allocated patients 2:1:1 to SOC (control), SOC + Cel, or SOC + ZA + Cel. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Results were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards and flexible parametric models adjusted for stratification factors. Results A total of 1,245 men were randomly assigned (Oct 2005 to April 2011). Groups were balanced: median age, 65 years; 61% metastatic, 14% N+/X M0, 25% N0M0; 94% newly diagnosed; median prostate-specific antigen, 66 ng/mL. Median follow-up was 69 months. Grade 3 to 5 adverse events were seen in 36% SOC-only, 33% SOC + Cel, and 32% SOC + ZA + Cel patients. There were 303 control arm deaths (83% prostate cancer), and median survival was 66 months.

Previous studies demonstrated benefits of linear programming (LP) for IMPT in terms of delivery efficiency by considerably reducing the number of spots required for the same quality of plans. However, a reduction in the number of spots may lead to loss of robustness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of plan quality and robustness of two robust optimization approaches using LP and nonlinear programming (NLP) models. The so-called ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization approaches and conventional planning target volume (PTV)-based optimization approach were applied to designing IMPT plans for five patients: two with prostate cancer, one with skull-based cancer, and two with head and neck cancer. For each approach, both LP and NLP models were used. Thus, for each case, six sets of IMPT plans were generated and assessed: LP-PTV-based, NLP-PTV-based, LP-worst case dose, NLP-worst case dose, LP-minmax, and NLP-minmax. The four robust optimization methods behaved differently from patient to patient, and no method emerged as superior to the others in terms of nominal plan quality and robustness against uncertainties. The plans generated using LP-based robust optimization were more robust regarding patient setup and range uncertainties than were those generated using NLP-based robust optimization for the prostate cancer patients. However, the robustness of plans generated using NLP-based methods was superior for the skull-based and head and neck cancer patients. Overall, LP-based methods were suitable for the less challenging cancer cases in which all uncertainty scenarios were able to satisfy tight dose constraints, while NLP performed better in more difficult cases in which most uncertainty scenarios were hard to meet tight dose limits. For robust optimization, the worst case dose approach was less sensitive to uncertainties than was the minmax approach for the prostate and skull-based cancer patients, whereas the minmax approach was superior for the head and neck cancer patients. The robustness of the IMPT plans was remarkably better after robust optimization than after PTV-based optimization, and the NLP-PTV-based optimization outperformed the LP-PTV-based optimization regarding robustness of clinical target volume coverage. In addition, plans generated using LP-based methods had notably fewer scanning spots than did those generated using NLP-based methods.""","""['Maryam Zaghian', 'Wenhua Cao', 'Wei Liu', 'Laleh Kardar', 'Sharmalee Randeniya', 'Radhe Mohan', 'Gino Lim']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Statistical evaluation of worst-case robust optimization intensity-modulated proton therapy plans using an exhaustive sampling approach.', 'Robust optimization for intensity-modulated proton therapy with soft spot sensitivity regularization.', 'Robust treatment planning with conditional value at risk chance constraints in intensity-modulated proton therapy.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Robust Proton Treatment Planning: Physical and Biological Optimization.', 'Beam mask and sliding window-facilitated deep learning-based accurate and efficient dose prediction for pencil beam scanning proton therapy.', 'Deep-Learning-based Fast and Accurate 3D CT Deformable Image Registration in Lung Cancer.', 'Virtual particle Monte Carlo: A new concept to avoid simulating secondary particles in proton therapy dose calculation.', 'A fast robust optimizer for intensity modulated proton therapy using GPU.', 'Dose prescription with spatial uncertainty for peripheral lung SBRT.']"""

This study evaluated 10 patients (662 fields throughout treatment) treated daily with an endorectal balloon (ERB) and 16 patients (840 fields throughout treatment) treated with a hydrogel spacer (GEL) without an ERB. Patient shifts were recorded before and after each treatment field, correlated with a treatment time, using x-ray imaging and implanted fiducial alignment. For each shift, recorded in X, Y, and Z, a 3D vector was calculated to determine the positional change. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean vector shift between ERB (0.06 cm) and GEL (0.09 cm), (P < 0.001). The mean includes a large number of zero shifts, but the smallest non-zero shift recorded was 0.2 cm. The largest shifts were, on average, in the Z direction (anterior to posterior). The average Z shift was +0.02 cm for both ERB and GEL. There was no statistical difference between ERB and GEL for shifts greater than 0.3 cm (P = 0.13) or greater than 0.5 cm (P = 0.36). For treatment times between 5 and 9 min, a majority of shifts were less than 0.2 cm, 85.9% for ERB and 73.2% for GEL. There was a significant positive correlation between the vector shifts and field time for both ERB (r = 0.2, P < 0.001) and GEL (r = 0.07, P < 0.04). We have shown that prostate motion is clinically comparable between an ERB and a hydrogel spacer, and the time dependencies are similar. A large majority of shifts for both ERB and hydrogel are well within a typical robust planning margin.

The commissioning was conducted through an optimization process, minimizing the discrepancies between calculated dose and measurement. We successfully commissioned six beam models built for Varian TrueBeam linac photon beams, including four beams of different energies (6 MV, 10 MV, 15 MV, and 18 MV) and two flattening-filter-free (FFF) beams of 6 MV and 10 MV.

It uses the pre-generated fluence maps (FMs) to bias the sampling of the control point for source particles already sampled from our beam model. It could effectively reduce the number of source particles required to reach a statistical uncertainty level in the calculated dose, as compared to the conventional FM weighting method. For a head-and-neck patient treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), a reduction factor of ~2.8 was achieved, accelerating dose calculation from 150.9 s to 51.5 s. The overall accuracy of goMC was investigated on a VMAT prostate patient case treated with 10 MV FFF beam. 3D gamma index test was conducted to evaluate the discrepancy between our calculated dose and the dose calculated in Varian Eclipse treatment planning system. The passing rate was 99.82% for 2%/2 mm criterion and 95.71% for 1%/1 mm criterion. Our studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of our auto-commissioning approach and new source sampling strategy for fast and accurate MC dose calculations for treatment plans.""","""['Zhen Tian', 'Yongbao Li', 'Nima Hassan-Rezaeian', 'Steve B Jiang', 'Xun Jia']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Automatic commissioning of a GPU-based Monte Carlo radiation dose calculation code for photon radiotherapy.', 'Feasibility of a GATE Monte Carlo platform in a clinical pretreatment QA system for VMAT treatment plans using TrueBeam with an HD120 multileaf collimator.', 'A GPU OpenCL based cross-platform Monte Carlo dose calculation engine (goMC).', 'High-density dental implants and radiotherapy planning: evaluation of effects on dose distribution using pencil beam convolution algorithm and Monte Carlo method.', 'Monte Carlo modelling of external radiotherapy photon beams.', 'CBCT-based synthetic CT generation using deep-attention cycleGAN for pancreatic adaptive radiotherapy.']"""

We, therefore, performed a prospective study to determine whether TPTPB is still superior to TRUS biopsy in the detection of prostate cancer in men with persistently elevated PSA after one previous negative set of TRUS biopsies.  Materials and methods:   42 patients with a background of one previous negative set of TRUS biopsy, persistently elevated PSA (but &lt; 20 ng/mL) and benign feeling digital rectal examination (DRE) underwent simultaneous standard 12-core TRUS biopsy and 36-core TPTPB under general anaesthesia. We determined the prostate cancer detection rate between the two diagnostic modalities.  Results:   Mean age was 65 years (range: 50-75), mean prostate volume was 59 cc (range: 21-152), mean PSA is 8.3 ng/L (range: 4.4-19), mean time difference between the study and the previous TRUS biopsy was 33 months (range: 1-150) with mean PSA velocity of 0.7 ng/mL/year (range: 0-8). Out of the 42 patients, 22 (52%) had benign pathology. Of the 20 patients (48%) diagnosed with prostate cancer, 4 (10%) had positive results in both TRUS biopsy and TPTPB, 1 (2%) had positive result in TRUS biopsy with negative TPTPB, while 15 (36%) had negative TRUS biopsy with positive TPTPB. Hence, TRUS biopsy detected cancer in 5/42 (12%) patients versus (19/42) 45% detected by TPTPB (P &lt; 0.01). 13/19 (68%) of cancers detected by TPTPB had Gleason score &ge;7. A total of 82/141 (58%) of positive cores was found in the anterior zone. One patient (2%) experienced urosepsis, 2 (5%) temporary urinary retention, 14 (34%) mild haematuria and 13 (32%) haematospermia.  Conclusion:   TPTPB still shows a significantly higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to TRUS biopsy (12% versus 45%, P &lt; 0.01) in men with a previous set of negative TRUS biopsy, persistently elevated PSA (but &lt; 20 ng/mL) and benign feeling prostate on DRE.""","""['Shady Nafie', 'Michael Wanis', 'Masood Khan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['The role of transperineal template prostate biopsies in prostate cancer diagnosis in biopsy naïve men with PSA less than 20\u2009ng\u2009ml(-1.).', 'Transperineal template prostate biopsies in men with raised PSA despite two previous sets of negative TRUS-guided prostate biopsies.', 'Transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy for detecting early prostate cancer: An Indian experience.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'The role of digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound, and prostate specific antigen for the detection of confined and clinically relevant prostate cancer.', 'Mass Spectrometry-Based Biomarkers to Detect Prostate Cancer: A Multicentric Study Based on Non-Invasive Urine Collection without Prior Digital Rectal Examination.', 'Combining prostate-specific antigen density with prostate imaging reporting and data system score version 2.1 to improve detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: A retrospective study.', 'Selective biomarkers for inflammation and infection are associated with post-operative complications following transperineal template prostate biopsy (TTPB): a single-centre observational clinical pilot-study.', 'A Model to Detect Significant Prostate Cancer Integrating Urinary Peptide and Extracellular Vesicle RNA Data.', 'A Nationwide Analysis of Risk of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Mortality following an Initial Negative Transrectal Ultrasound Biopsy with Long-Term Followup.']"""

A dual ceramic resonators scheme was designed wherein two ceramic resonators were connected in parallel: one resonator was used as the sensing unit and the other as the control unit. This arrangement minimizes environmental influences including temperature fluctuation, while achieving the required frequency stability for biosensing applications. The detection of the cancer markers Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and α-Fetoprotein (AFP) was carried out through frequency change measurement. The device showed high sensitivity (0.25 ng/ml) and fast detection (within 30 min) with small samples (1 μl), which is compatible with the requirements of clinical measurements.

The aim of this study was to describe PCa characteristics and long-term outcomes in young men aged ≤55 years after radical prostatectomy (RP) and to compare them with older men cohort. Methods. Among 2,200 patients who underwent RP for clinically localized PCa at our centre between 2001 and 2015, 277 (10.3%) men aged ≤55 years were identified. All preoperative and pathological parameters were compared between groups. Biochemical progression free survival (BPFS) and disease progression free survival (DPFS) were assessed at 5 and 10 years. Results. Men aged ≤55 years had similar pathological tumor characteristics and biochemical recurrence rate (BCR) compared to their older counterparts. Disease progression rate 2.5% versus 0.4% was higher in older patients (p = 0.026). BPFS rate was not different in both study groups. Estimated 10-year DPFS was 98.8% in younger men compared to 89.2% in their older counterparts (p = 0.031). Multivariate Cox regression showed that Gleason score lymph-nodes and surgical margins status were significant predictors for disease progression. Conclusions. In our cohort, men aged ≤55 years had similar pathological PCa characteristics and BCR rate in comparison with older men.

A porous and conductive substrate of chitosan-lead ferrocyanide-(poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)-graphene oxide) was in-situ generated on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE), in which Pb2[Fe(CN)6] served as a novel redox species with strong current signal at -0.46 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)-graphene oxide was applied to improve conductivity of the substrate. After adsorbing Pb2+ for signal amplification, chitosan provided active sites to simultaneously immobilize peptides and 1-aminopropyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride by glutaraldehyde. To enhance the sensitivity, BSA was chemically linked to the immobilized peptide, behaving as a serious decrease of current signal for BSA hindering the electron transfer. The dramatic increase of current signal of the biosensor was obtained by PSA cleaving the immobilized BSA-peptide.

Objective:   To compare functional outcomes and adverse effects associated with radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and active surveillance.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective, population-based, cohort study involving 2550 men (≤80 years) diagnosed in 2011-2012 with clinical stage cT1-2, localized prostate cancer, with prostate-specific antigen levels less than 50 ng/mL, and enrolled within 6 months of diagnosis.  Exposures:   Treatment with radical prostatectomy, EBRT, or active surveillance was ascertained within 1 year of diagnosis.  Main outcomes and measures:   Patient-reported function on the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) 36 months after enrollment. Higher domain scores (range, 0-100) indicate better function. Minimum clinically important difference was defined as 10 to 12 points for sexual function, 6 for urinary incontinence, 5 for urinary irritative symptoms, 5 for bowel function, and 4 for hormonal function.  Results:   The cohort included 2550 men (mean age, 63.8 years; 74% white, 55% had intermediate- or high-risk disease), of whom 1523 (59.7%) underwent radical prostatectomy, 598 (23.5%) EBRT, and 429 (16.8%) active surveillance. Men in the EBRT group were older (mean age, 68.1 years vs 61.5 years, P < .001) and had worse baseline sexual function (mean score, 52.3 vs 65.2, P < .001) than men in the radical prostatectomy group. At 3 years, the adjusted mean sexual domain score for radical prostatectomy decreased more than for EBRT (mean difference, -11.9 points; 95% CI, -15.1 to -8.7). The decline in sexual domain scores between EBRT and active surveillance was not clinically significant (-4.3 points; 95% CI, -9.2 to 0.7). Radical prostatectomy was associated with worse urinary incontinence than EBRT (-18.0 points; 95% CI, -20.5 to -15.4) and active surveillance (-12.7 points; 95% CI, -16.0 to -9.3) but was associated with better urinary irritative symptoms than active surveillance (5.2 points; 95% CI, 3.2 to 7.2). No clinically significant differences for bowel or hormone function were noted beyond 12 months. No differences in health-related quality of life or disease-specific survival (3 deaths) were noted (99.7%-100%).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy was associated with a greater decrease in sexual function and urinary incontinence than either EBRT or active surveillance after 3 years and was associated with fewer urinary irritative symptoms than active surveillance; however, no meaningful differences existed in either bowel or hormonal function beyond 12 months or in in other domains of health-related quality-of-life measures.

However, its expression decreases during prostate cancer (PCa) progression, whereas SRD5A1 increases, and the mechanism underlying this transcriptional regulatory switch is still unknown. Interrogation of SRD5A messenger RNA expression in three publicly available data sets confirmed that SRD5A1 is increased in primary and metastatic PCa compared with nontumoral prostate tissues, whereas SRD5A2 is decreased. Activation of AR, a major oncogenic driver of PCa, induced the expression of SRD5A1 from twofold to fourfold in three androgen-responsive PCa cell lines. In contrast, AR repressed SRD5A2 expression in this context. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation studies established that AR is recruited to both SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 genes following androgen stimulation but initiates transcriptional activation only at SRD5A1 as monitored by recruitment of RNA polymerase II and the presence of the H3K27Ac histone mark. Furthermore, we showed that the antiandrogens bicalutamide and enzalutamide block the AR-mediated regulation of both SRD5A1 and SRD5A2, highlighting an additional mechanism explaining their beneficial effects in patients. In summary, we identified an AR-dependent transcriptional regulation that explains the differential expression of 5α-reductase types 1 and 2 during PCa progression. Our work thus defines a mechanism by which androgens control their own synthesis via differential regulatory control of the expression of SRD5A1 and SRD5A2.""","""['Étienne Audet-Walsh', 'Tracey Yee', 'Ingrid S Tam', 'Vincent Giguère']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Profiles of 5α-Reduced Androgens in Humans and Eels: 5α-Dihydrotestosterone and 11-Ketodihydrotestosterone Are Active Androgens Produced in Eel Gonads.', 'Antiandrogenic mechanisms of pesticides in human LNCaP prostate and H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells.', 'Androgen regulation of 5α-reductase isoenzymes in prostate cancer: implications for prostate cancer prevention.', 'The rationale for inhibiting 5alpha-reductase isoenzymes in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'GEN GEN: the genomic genetic analysis of androgen-metabolic genes and prostate cancer as a paradigm for the dissection of complex phenotypes.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'Three Members of Transmembrane-4-Superfamily, TM4SF1, TM4SF4, and TM4SF5, as Emerging Anticancer Molecular Targets against Cancer Phenotypes and Chemoresistance.', 'Upregulation of mir-1199-5p is associated with reduced type 2 5-α reductase expression in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Scaffold protein MAPK8IP2 expression is a robust prognostic factor in prostate cancer associated with AR signaling activity.', 'Mutational analysis of compound heterozygous mutation p.Q6X/p.H232R in SRD5A2 causing 46,XY disorder of sex development.']"""

This study investigated the consequences of disrupted TGF-β signaling on prostate tumor growth under conditions of castration-induced androgen deprivation in the preclinical model of DNTGFβRII. Our results indicate that in response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) the proliferative index in prostate tumors from DNTGFβRII mice was higher compared with prostate tumors from TGFβRII wild-type (WT) mice, whereas there was a reduced incidence of apoptosis in tumors from DNTGFβRII. Protein and gene expression profiling revealed that tumors from DNTGFβRII mice exhibit a strong nuclear AR localization among the prostate tumor epithelial cells and increased AR messenger RNA after ADT. In contrast, TGFβRII WT mice exhibited a marked loss in nuclear AR in prostate tumor acini (20 weeks), followed by a downregulation of AR and transmembrane protease serine 2 messenger RNA. There was a significant increase in nuclear AR and activity in prostate tumors from castrate DNTGFβRII compared with TGFβRII WT mice. Consequential to aberrant TGF-β signaling, ADT enhanced expression and nuclear localization of Smad4 and β-catenin. Our findings support that under castrate conditions, aberrant TGF-β signaling leads to AR activation and β-catenin nuclear localization, an adaptation mechanism contributing to emergence of CRPC.

This region containing the both loci is frequently deleted in a variety of human malignancies, including prostate cancer. LZTS2 is a ß-catenin-binding protein and a negative regulator of Wnt signaling. Overexpression of PTEN in prostate cancer cell lines reduces ß-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity. In this study, we examined the collaborative effect of PTEN and LZTS2 using multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches. Co-expression of PTEN and LZTS2 in prostate cancer cells shows stronger repressive effect on ß-catenin mediated transcription. Using a newly generated mouse model, we further assessed the effect of simultaneous deletion of Pten and Lzts2 in the murine prostate. We observed that mice with both Lzts2 and Pten deletion have an earlier onset of prostate carcinomas as well as an accelerated tumor progression compared to mice with Pten or Lzts2 deletion alone. Immunohistochemical analyses show that atypical and tumor cells from compound mice with both Pten and Lzts2 deletion are mainly composed of prostate luminal epithelial cells and possess higher levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin. These cells also exhibit a higher proliferative capacity than cells isolated from single deletion mice.

However, some patients have a high risk of progression despite ART. The role of systemic therapy with ART in this high-risk group remains to be defined.  Methods:   Patients who had either a post-RP prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir > 0.2 ng/mL and a Gleason score ≥7 or a PSA nadir ≤0.2 ng/mL, a Gleason score ≥8, and a pathologic tumor (pT) classification ≥ pT3 received 6 months of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) plus radiotherapy and 6 cycles of docetaxel. The primary objective was to assess whether the addition of ADT and docetaxel to ART resulted in a freedom from progression (FFP) rate ≥ 70% compared with an expected rate of 50%. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to model associations between factors and outcomes.  Results:   In total, 74 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up was 4.4 years. The pathologic tumor classification was pT2 in 4% of patients, pT3 in 95%, and pT4 in 1%. The Gleason score was 7 in 18% of patients and ≥8 in 82%. Post-RP PSA levels were ≤0.2 ng/mL in 53% of patients and >0.2 ng/mL in 47%. The 3-year FFP rate was 73% (95% confidence interval, 61%-83%), and the 3-year cumulative incidence of biochemical, distant, and local failure was 26%, 7%, and 0%, respectively. In multivariate models, postprostatectomy PSA nadir was associated with 3-year FFP, Gleason score, and PSA with biochemical failure. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was common; however, only 3 episodes of febrile neutropenia occurred. Late toxicities were not impacted by the addition of systemic therapy.  Conclusions:   Combined ADT, docetaxel, and ART for men with high-risk prostate cancer after prostatectomy exceeded the prespecified study endpoint of 70% 3-year FFP.

Men castrated before puberty (eunuchs) or men with inherited deficiency of type II 5α-reductase (with failure to convert testosterone to the more potent dihydrotestosterone) (DHT) do not develop PCa. To date, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with anti-androgen treatments to reduce or prevent androgens from binding to the AR remains the main therapeutic option for advanced PCa since its discovery by Huggins and Hodges in 1941. Multiple strategies related to surgical/chemical castration with combinations of various anti-androgens, including Cyproterone Acetate, Flutamide, Nilutamide, Bicalutamide (Casodex) and Enzalutamide, as well as some androgen synthesis blockers, including Abiraterone, have been used to control PCa progression. However, patients on ADT with anti-androgen treatment eventually develop resistance, which might be accompanied with the unwanted side effects of enhanced metastasis.

Methods:   This cross-sectional study used the 2012 and 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys. Respondents were categorized based on the year in which they responded to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey. Quality of prescreening discussion was operationalized as having discussed only advantages, only disadvantages, both advantages and disadvantages, or neither. Race/ethnicity, education level, income, insurance status, and having a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level actually drawn after prescreening counseling served as confounders in our multivariate analysis.  Results:   Among 217,053 men in the analytic sample, 37% were told about only advantages of PSA screening compared to 30% of men who were advised about both advantages and disadvantages. Men who were told about neither advantages nor disadvantages were more likely to be Hispanic, not graduate high school, have low income, and not have insurance. Controlling for covariates, men in 2014 were significantly more likely to have undergone PSA testing without having discussed either advantages or disadvantages than men in 2012.  Conclusion:   Comprehensive prescreening discussions about advantages and disadvantages of PSA testing are critical to informed decision making about prostate cancer screening. Disparities not only exist with regard to the quality of prescreening discussions that patients receive from their providers prior to PSA testing across categories of race/ethnicity, education, income, and insurance status, but these disparities became more substantial between 2012 and 2014.

PTX (20 nM) suppressed cell proliferation and increased various ceramide species in PC3, but not PC3-PR, cells. PC3-PR contained higher S1P levels than did PC3, regardless of PTX treatment. Western blotting revealed that PC3-PR cells expressed higher levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) and glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) but lower levels of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) and neutral sphingomyelinase 2 than did PC3 cells. Inhibition of SPHK1 using siRNA or a pharmacological inhibitor decreased S1P levels in PC3-PR cells and inhibited proliferation in the presence or absence of PTX, suggesting that SPHK1 is at least partially responsible for PTX resistance. Similarly, GCS inhibitors (PDMP and PPMP) increased cellular ceramides and suppressed the proliferation of PC3-PR.

We evaluated the impact of PSA isoforms on risk stratification in patients with low-risk PCa as well as in active surveillance (AS) candidates who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   A total of 112 patients with biopsy confirmed Gleason score (GS) 6 PCa of four different international institutions were prospectively enrolled in the study. Blood withdrawal was performed the day before radical prostatectomy. In addition, patients were classified according to the EAU and NCCN criteria for AS candidates. PSA, free PSA (fPSA) and proPSA were measured using dual monoclonal antibody sandwich immunoassays. In addition, the Prostate Health Index (PHI=proPSA/fPSA × √PSA) was calculated. Final histology of the radical prostatectomy specimens was correlated to PSA, its isoforms and PHI.  Results:   Serum proPSA levels were significantly elevated in those patients with an upgrade in final histology (GS⩾7). In addition, higher proPSA levels were predictive for extraprostatic extension (⩾pT3a) as well as for positive surgical margins. Interestingly, PHI had an even higher predictive power when compared with proPSA alone concerning GS upgrading, extraprostatic extension and surgical margins in both the total and the AS patient group.  Conclusion:   We showed in a multicenter study that proPSA is a valuable biomarker to detect patients with aggressive PCa in a cohort of GS 6 patients, who would benefit from active tumor therapy. Combining proPSA with the standard markers PSA and fPSA using PHI further increases the predictive accuracy significantly. Moreover, our data support the use of PHI for monitoring PCa patients under AS.""","""['I Heidegger', 'H Klocker', 'R Pichler', 'A Pircher', 'W Prokop', 'E Steiner', 'C Ladurner', 'E Comploj', 'A Lunacek', 'D Djordjevic', 'A Pycha', 'E Plas', 'W Horninger', 'J Bektic']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Preoperative prostate health index predicts adverse pathology and Gleason score upgrading after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Preoperative Prostate-specific Antigen Isoform p2PSA and Its Derivatives, %p2PSA and Prostate Health Index, Predict Pathologic Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: Results from a Multicentric European Prospective Study.', 'Serum isoform -2proPSA derivatives significantly improve prediction of prostate cancer at initial biopsy in a total PSA range of 2-10 ng/ml: a multicentric European study.', 'Clinical use of -2proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives (%p2PSA and Prostate Health Index) for the detection of prostate cancer: a review of the literature.', 'From prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to precursor PSA (proPSA) isoforms: a review of the emerging role of proPSAs in the detection and management of early prostate cancer.', 'Is Active Surveillance Too Active?', 'Development of a novel nomogram for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer with the prostate health index and multiparametric MRI.', 'Prostate Health Index (phi) and its derivatives predict Gleason score upgrading after radical prostatectomy among patients with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Biomarker in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Role of prostate health index to predict Gleason score upgrading and high-risk prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens.']"""

The proposed method classifies brain cancer on shape-based feature extraction as either benign or malignant. The authors used input variables such as shape distance (SD) and shape similarity measure (SSM) in fuzzy tools, and used fuzzy rules to evaluate the risk status as an output variable. We presented a classifier neural network system (NNS), namely Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), which is a feed-forward back-propagation learning algorithm used to train the NN for the status of brain cancer, if any, and which achieved satisfactory performance with 100% accuracy.  Methods:   The proposed methodology is divided into three phases. First, we find the region of interest (ROI) in the brain to detect the tumors using CT and MR images. Second, we extract the shape-based features, like SD and SSM, and grade the brain tumors as benign or malignant with the concept of SD function and SSM as shape-based parameters. Third, we classify the brain cancers using neuro-fuzzy tools. In this experiment, we used a 16-sample database with SSM (μ) values and classified the benignancy or malignancy of the brain tumor lesions using the neuro-fuzzy system (NFS).  Results:   We have developed a fuzzy expert system (FES) and NFS for early detection of brain cancer from CT and MR images. In this experiment, shape-based features, such as SD and SSM, were extracted from the ROI of brain tumor lesions. These shape-based features were considered as input variables and, using fuzzy rules, we were able to evaluate brain cancer risk values for each case. We used an NNS with LM, a feed-forward back-propagation learning algorithm, as a classifier for the diagnosis of brain cancer and achieved satisfactory performance with 100% accuracy. The proposed network was trained with MR image datasets of 16 cases. The 16 cases were fed to the ANN with 2 input neurons, one hidden layer of 10 neurons and 2 output neurons. Of the 16-sample database, 10 datasets for training, 3 datasets for validation, and 3 datasets for testing were used in the ANN classification system. From the SSM (µ) confusion matrix, the number of output datasets of true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative was 6, 0, 10, and 0, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were each equal to 100%.  Conclusion:   The method of diagnosing brain cancer presented in this study is a successful model to assist doctors in the screening and treatment of brain cancer patients. The presented FES successfully identified the presence of brain cancer in CT and MR images using the extracted shape-based features and the use of NFS for the identification of brain cancer in the early stages. From the analysis and diagnosis of the disease, the doctors can decide the stage of cancer and take the necessary steps for more accurate treatment. Here, we have presented an investigation and comparison study of the shape-based feature extraction method with the use of NFS for classifying brain tumors as showing normal or abnormal patterns. The results have proved that the shape-based features with the use of NFS can achieve a satisfactory performance with 100% accuracy. We intend to extend this methodology for the early detection of cancer in other regions such as the prostate region and human cervix.""","""['Subrata Kar', 'D Dutta Majumder']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['A Novel Approach of Mathematical Theory of Shape and Neuro-Fuzzy Based Diagnostic Analysis of Cervical Cancer.', 'Automatic Detection and Classification of Lung Nodules in CT Image Using Optimized Neuro Fuzzy Classifier with Cuckoo Search Algorithm.', 'MRI Brain Tumour Segmentation Using Hybrid Clustering and Classification by Back Propagation Algorithm.', 'Comparative Approach of MRI-Based Brain Tumor Segmentation and Classification Using Genetic Algorithm.', 'Review on Hybrid Segmentation Methods for Identification of Brain Tumor in MRI.', 'The Association between Mortality-to-Incidence Ratios and Health Expenditures in Brain and Nervous System Cancers.', 'A Novel Approach of Mathematical Theory of Shape and Neuro-Fuzzy Based Diagnostic Analysis of Cervical Cancer.', 'Modeling analysis of the relationship between atherosclerosis and related inflammatory factors.']"""

Immune checkpoint blockade using antibodies against cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) or programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD1/PD-L1) generates durable therapeutic responses in a significant subset of patients across a variety of cancer types. However, mCRPC showed overwhelming de novo resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, motivating a search for targeted therapies that overcome this resistance. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are known to play important roles in tumour immune evasion. The abundance of circulating MDSCs correlates with prostate-specific antigen levels and metastasis in patients with prostate cancer. Mouse models of prostate cancer show that MDSCs (CD11b+Gr1+) promote tumour initiation and progression. These observations prompted us to hypothesize that robust immunotherapy responses in mCRPC may be elicited by the combined actions of immune checkpoint blockade agents together with targeted agents that neutralize MDSCs yet preserve T-cell function. Here we develop a novel chimaeric mouse model of mCRPC to efficiently test combination therapies in an autochthonous setting. Combination of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 engendered only modest efficacy. Targeted therapy against mCRPC-infiltrating MDSCs, using multikinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib and BEZ235, also showed minimal anti-tumour activities. Strikingly, primary and metastatic CRPC showed robust synergistic responses when immune checkpoint blockade was combined with MDSC-targeted therapy. Mechanistically, combination therapy efficacy stemmed from the upregulation of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and suppression of MDSC-promoting cytokines secreted by prostate cancer cells. These observations illuminate a clinical path hypothesis for combining immune checkpoint blockade with MDSC-targeted therapies in the treatment of mCRPC.""","""['Xin Lu', 'James W Horner', 'Erin Paul', 'Xiaoying Shang', 'Patricia Troncoso', 'Pingna Deng', 'Shan Jiang', 'Qing Chang', 'Denise J Spring', 'Padmanee Sharma', 'John A Zebala', 'Dean Y Maeda', 'Y Alan Wang', 'Ronald A DePinho']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Erratum: Effective combinatorial immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: New model to test immunotherapy combinations.', 'Re: Effective Combinatorial Immunotherapy for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Differential Targeting of Gr-MDSCs, T Cells and Prostate Cancer Cells by Dactolisib and Dasatinib.', '(-)-4-O-(4-O-β-D-glucopyranosylcaffeoyl) Quinic Acid Inhibits the Function of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells to Enhance the Efficacy of Anti-PD1 against Colon Cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Myeloid-derived suppressor cells inhibit T cell activation through nitrating LCK in mouse cancers.', 'A Systematic Review of Immunotherapy in Urologic Cancer: Evolving Roles for Targeting of CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1, and HLA-G.', 'The recent progress of myeloid-derived suppressor cell and its targeted therapies in cancers.', 'BTK inhibition potentiates anti-PD-L1 treatment in murine melanoma: potential role for MDSC modulation in immunotherapy.', 'Circulating and Tumor-Associated Neutrophils in the Era of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: Dynamics, Phenotypes, Metabolism, and Functions.', 'Immunogenomic profiles associated with response to life-prolonging agents in prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic inhibition of CXCR1/2: where do we stand?']"""

The lack of healthcare providers and infrastructure in rural areas has been linked to a number of negative consequences. Among the elderly rural population, the lack of proximal access presents greater barriers because many elderly people are further limited in their ability to travel and pay for services. In the Deep South specifically, rural residents experience limited access to care and overall poor health outcomes. With cancer in particular, the Deep South has been dubbed the ""cancer belt,"" faring far worse in prevalence and mortality rates than other areas of the country. The present study examines the average travel distance for rural elderly patients residing in the Deep South who are receiving treatment for prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer. We analyzed Medicare claims data of beneficiaries residing in the five Deep South states who had received a primary diagnosis of prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer, with a service date ranging from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2014. The findings reveal that rural Medicare beneficiaries in the Deep South travel significantly greater distances than do their urban counterparts. In addition, travel distances to prostate cancer treatment facilities are significantly greater than those to breast or colorectal cancer treatment facilities. With cancer incidence predicted to increase, the need to reduce travel distances to treatment is vital in efforts to curb the mortality rate in the Deep South.""","""['Mary J Wills', 'Marilyn V Whitman', 'Thomas M English']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Healthc Manag""","""['Geographic access to health care for rural Medicare beneficiaries.', 'Evaluating Travel Distance to Radiation Facilities Among Rural and Urban Breast Cancer Patients in the Medicare Population.', 'Association between the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and patient wait times and travel distance for chemotherapy.', 'Closing the Rural Cancer Care Gap: Three Institutional Approaches.', ""The impact of travel on cancer patients' experiences of treatment: a literature review."", 'Clinical risk factors and social needs of 30-day readmission among patients with diabetes: A retrospective study of the Deep South.', 'Racial Distribution of Neighborhood-Level Social Deprivation in a Retrospective Cohort of Prostate Cancer Survivors.', 'Ineligible, Unaware, or Uninterested?

However, the disease eventually progresses and develops resistance to ADT in majority of the patients, leading to the emergence of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we assessed artesunate (AS), an artemisinin derivative, for its anticancer properties and ability to alleviate resistance to androgen receptor (AR) antagonists. We have shown AS in combination with bicalutamide (Bic) attenuates the oncogenic properties of the castrate-resistant (PC3, 22RV1) and androgen-responsive (LNCaP) PCa cells. Mechanistically, AS and Bic combination inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling and decreases AR and/or AR-variant 7 expression via ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. The combination induces oxidative stress and apoptosis via survivin downregulation and caspase-3 activation, resulting in poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Moreover, preclinical castrate-resistant PC3 xenograft studies in NOD/SCID mice (n =28, seven per group) show remarkable tumor regression and significant reduction in lungs and bone metastases upon administering AS (50 mg/kg per day in two divided doses) and Bic (50 mg/kg per day) via oral gavage. Taken together, we for the first time provide a compelling preclinical rationale that AS could disrupt AR antagonist-mediated resistance observed in mCRPC.

We examined the effect of a 6-month program of aerobic and resistance exercise aimed at improving body composition and cardiorespiratory health in this population.  Methods:   Ninety-seven men (43-90 yr) with localized prostate cancer receiving ADT were randomized to either exercise (EX, n = 50) or usual care (CON, n = 47). Supervised exercise was undertaken twice weekly at moderate to high intensity. Measures of cardiorespiratory capacity (V˙O2max), resting metabolic rate, central blood pressure, hemodynamic variables, blood markers, and body composition were assessed.  Results:   There was a significant group-time interaction present for V˙O2max (P = 0.033) with a treatment effect for EX of 0.11 L·min (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04-0.19) (relative to body mass = 1.3 mL·kg·min, 95% CI = 0.3-2.3) and fat oxidation (P = 0.037) of 12.0 mg·min (95% CI = 2.3-21.7). Similarly, there was a significant improvement in glucose (P < 0.001) for EX of -0.5 mmol·L (95% CI = -0.8 to -0.3), with no change in prostate-specific antigen or testosterone as a result of exercise. Body composition was enhanced for EX with adjusted mean differences in lean mass (P = 0.015) of 0.8 kg (95% CI = 0.3-1.3), total fat mass (P = 0.020) of -1.1 kg (95% CI = -1.8 to -0.5), and trunk fat mass (P < 0.001) of -1.0 kg (95% CI = -1.4 to -0.6).  Conclusion:   A 6-month combined aerobic and resistance exercise program has a significant favorable effect on cardiorespiratory capacity, resting fat oxidation, glucose, and body composition despite the adverse effects of hormone suppression.

The mechanisms by which neuroendocrine (NE) cells arises from prostate adenocarcinoma cells are poorly understood. FOXA1 is a transcription factor of the forkhead family that is required for prostate epithelial differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated that FOXA1 loss drives NE differentiation, demarcated by phenotypical changes and NEPC marker expressions. Mechanistically, this is mediated by FOXA1 binding to the promoter of interleukin 8 (IL-8), a chemokine previously shown elevated in NEPC, to directly inhibit its expression. Further, IL-8 upregulation activates the MAPK/ERK pathway, leading to ERK phosphorylation and enolase 2 (ENO2) expression. IL-8 knockdown or ERK inhibition, on the other hand, abolished FOXA1 loss-induced NE differentiation. Analysis of xenograft mouse models confirmed FOXA1 loss in NEPC tumors relative to its adenocarcinoma counterparts. Importantly, FOXA1 is downregulated in human NEPC tumors compared to primary and castration-resistant prostate cancers, and its expression is negatively correlated with that of ENO2. These findings indicate that FOXA1 transcriptionally suppresses IL-8, the expression of which would otherwise stimulate the MAPK/ERK pathway to promote NE differentiation of prostate cancer cells. Our data strongly suggest that FOXA1 loss may play a significant role in enabling prostate cancer progression to NEPC, whereas IL-8 and MAPK/ERK pathways may be promising targets for therapeutic intervention.""","""['J Kim', 'H Jin', 'J C Zhao', 'Y A Yang', 'Y Li', 'X Yang', 'X Dong', 'J Yu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Reprogramming of the FOXA1 cistrome in treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Expression and role of Foxa proteins in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of Novel Diagnosis Biomarkers for Therapy-Related Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer: novel morphological insights and future therapeutic perspectives.', 'Models of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Chemokine receptor CXCR7 activates Aurora Kinase A and promotes neuroendocrine prostate cancer growth.', 'Aerobic glycolysis in colon cancer is repressed by naringin via the HIF1Α pathway.', 'Endocrine and paracrine characteristics of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'FOXA1 repression drives lineage plasticity and immune heterogeneity in bladder cancers with squamous differentiation.']"""

We show here that the drebrin/EB3 pathway, which co-ordinates dynamic microtubule/actin filament interactions underlying cell shape changes in response to guidance cues, plays a role in prostate cancer cell invasion. Drebrin expression is restricted to basal epithelial cells in benign human prostate but is upregulated in luminal epithelial cells in foci of prostatic malignancy. Drebrin is also upregulated in human prostate cancer cell lines and co-localizes with actin filaments and dynamic microtubules in filopodia of pseudopods of invading cells under a chemotactic gradient of the chemokine CXCL12. Disruption of the drebrin/EB3 pathway using BTP2, a small molecule inhibitor of drebrin binding to actin filaments, reduced the invasion of prostate cancer cell lines in 3D in vitro assays. Furthermore, gain- or loss-of-function of drebrin or EB3 by over-expression or siRNA-mediated knockdown increases or decreases invasion of prostate cancer cell lines in 3D in vitro assays, respectively. Finally, expression of a dominant-negative construct that competes with EB3 binding to drebrin, also inhibited invasion of prostate cancer cell lines in 3D in vitro assays. Our findings show that co-ordination of dynamic microtubules and actin filaments by the drebrin/EB3 pathway drives prostate cancer cell invasion and is therefore implicated in disease progression.""","""['A E Dart', 'D C Worth', 'G Muir', 'A Chandra', 'J D Morris', 'C McKee', 'C Verrill', 'R J Bryant', 'P R Gordon-Weeks']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""[""The role of the drebrin/EB3/Cdk5 pathway in dendritic spine plasticity, implications for Alzheimer's disease."", 'The drebrin/EB3 pathway regulates cytoskeletal dynamics to drive neuritogenesis in embryonic cortical neurons.', 'Phosphorylation of Drebrin and Its Role in Neuritogenesis.', 'Targeting of the F-actin-binding protein drebrin by the microtubule plus-tip protein EB3 is required for neuritogenesis.', 'Cell Shape Change by Drebrin.', 'Drebrin Regulates Acetylcholine Receptor Clustering and Organization of Microtubules at the Postsynaptic Machinery.', 'Development of Store-Operated Calcium Entry-Targeted Compounds in Cancer.', 'Modulation of Actin Filament Dynamics by Inward Rectifying of Potassium Channel Kir2.1.', 'Tunneling nanotubes: A bridge for heterogeneity in glioblastoma and a new therapeutic target?', 'Ca2+ as a therapeutic target in cancer.']"""

A vector model base, retrieving similar radiotherapy cases, was developed with respect to the structural and physiologic features extracted from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files. Planning parameters were retrieved from the selected similar reference case and applied to the test case to bypass the gradual adjustment of planning parameters. Therefore, the planning time spent on the traditional trial-and-error manual optimization approach in the beginning of optimization could be reduced. Each S&S IMRT/VMAT prostate reference database comprised 100 previously treated cases. Prostate cases were replanned with both traditional optimization and vector-model-supported optimization based on the oncologists' clinical dose prescriptions. A total of 360 plans, which consisted of 30 cases of S&S IMRT, 30 cases of 1-arc VMAT, and 30 cases of 2-arc VMAT plans including first optimization and final optimization with/without vector-model-supported optimization, were compared using the 2-sided t-test and paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, with a significance level of 0.05 and a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. For S&S IMRT, 1-arc VMAT, and 2-arc VMAT prostate plans, there was a significant reduction in the planning time and iteration with vector-model-supported optimization by almost 50%. When the first optimization plans were compared, 2-arc VMAT prostate plans had better plan quality than 1-arc VMAT plans. The volume receiving 35 Gy in the femoral head for 2-arc VMAT plans was reduced with the vector-model-supported optimization compared with the traditional manual optimization approach.

To investigate this issue, 144 10 year PCa survivors were asked about the frequency of urinary incontinence, a common side effect of some PCa treatments. The 53 patients who suffered urinary incontinence had significantly higher depression scores on the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale than those patients who did not report urinary incontinence.

Docetaxel episodes included docetaxel claim costs from the first claim until 30 days after the last claim, with earlier termination for death, insurance disenrollment, or the end of a 24-month look-forward period from initial docetaxel index date. Docetaxel drug claim costs were adjusted for 2011 generic docetaxel introduction, while other costs were adjusted to 2015 values using the national average annual unit cost increase.  Results:   This study identified 281 Medicare-insured and 155 commercially insured men, with 325 and 172 docetaxel episodes, respectively. The average number of cycles (unique docetaxel infusion days) per episode was 6.9 for Medicare and 6.3 for commercial cohorts. The average cost per episode was $28,792 for Medicare and $67,958 for commercial cohorts, with docetaxel drug costs contributing $2,588 and $13,169 per episode, respectively. The average cost per episode on docetaxel infusion days was $8,577 (30%) for Medicare and $28,412 (42%) for commercial.

Previous studies have reported that the relative expression of miR-1 is significantly downregulated in recurrent prostate cancer (PCa) samples when compared with nonrecurrent PCa tissues. However, whether miR-1 can serve as a novel predictive biomarker for PCa recurrence still remains unclear.  Materials and methods:   The patients with clinically localized PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy by the same medical team at the Department of Urology, Ningbo No.2 Hospital were enrolled in this study. We examined the miR-1 expression levels in recurrent and nonrecurrent tumor samples by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were used for the evaluation of potential predictors of PCa recurrence.  Results:   During the study period, 78 patients (including 27 in the recurrent group and 51 in the nonrecurrent group) who were diagnosed with PCa and who underwent radical prostatectomy were included in the final analysis. MiR-1 was significantly downregulated in recurrent PCa tissues when compared with nonrecurrent tumor samples (P < 0.001). The univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses indicated that miR-1 was the only independent prognostic factor for PCa recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.86; 95% CI: 1.21-2.94; P = 0.011).

Materials and methods:   A total of 6857 patients with PCa treated with RP at six different hospitals in Denmark between 1995 and 2011. Data were extracted from the nationwide DaPCa database. Histopathology reports from the RP specimens were manually reviewed. Date and cause of death were obtained from national registries and cross-checked in patient files. The cumulative incidence of PCa specific mortality (PCSM) was analysed with the Aalen-Johansen method for competing risks with non-PCa death as a competing event. Risk of PCSM was analysed in a multivariate Cox regression model using age, preoperative PSA level, surgical margin status, RP Gleason score (GS), pathological T-category, and N-category as explanatory variables.  Results:   The median follow-up was 6.4 years. Significant temporal changes in clinicopathological parameters were observed. During the study period, median age at surgery increased from 61.4 to 64.8 years and median preoperative PSA declined from 12.0 to 8.0 ng/ml. The proportion of men with pT2 PCa increased from 65% to 75% whereas the proportion of pT3 cancers decreased from 28% to 25%. The percentage of men with positive surgical margins decreased from 37% to 20%. During follow-up, 644 patients died, whereof 189 (29.3%) died from PCa. The cumulative incidence of PCSM and other-cause mortality after 15 years was 10.3% (95% CI 8.0-12.7) and 18.2% (95% CI 15.4-20.9), respectively.

Compared with GS ≤6, both GS +4 (HR 1.47), GS 4 + 3 (HR 2.32), GS 8 (HR 4.8) and GS 9 or 10 (HR 5.26) significantly increased the risk of PCa death. T3a PCa and T3b/T4 was also a significant predictor of PCSM with an increased risk of PCa death compared with pT2 of 2.24 and 4.5, respectively.  Conclusions:   In a complete national cohort of men treated with RP during a 17-year period, we described the incidence of mortality after RP and predictors of PCSM. We demonstrated that RP GS and pT-category are the most significant predictors of PCa mortality. We found that an increasing proportion of men undergo RP for low-risk PCa suggesting that early detection of PCa is indeed undergoing in Denmark despite national recommendations. The Danish national results seem to concur with findings from international single- and multi-institutional reports.""","""['Mikael Heering', 'Kasper Drimer Berg', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Peter Iversen', 'Martin Andreas Røder']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Surg Oncol""","""['Survival after radical prostatectomy for clinically localised prostate cancer: a population-based study.', 'New Prostate Cancer Grading System Predicts Long-term Survival Following Surgery for Gleason Score 8-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of surgical margin status on prostate-cancer-specific mortality.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy for clinically localised prostate cancer at Rigshospitalet 1995-2011 - an analysis of surgical and oncological outcome.', ""Oncological Outcomes of Open Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy in Ireland: A Single Surgeon's 5-Year Experience."", 'Surgical margin status and its impact on prostate cancer prognosis after radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis.', 'Validation of American Joint Committee on Cancer eighth staging system among prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.']"""

This retrospectively designed cohort study investigated the association of smoking history at RP with subsequent CaP treatment outcomes and overall mortality. A total of 1981 patients who underwent RP at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) between 1993 and 2014 were studied. Smoking history was considered as a risk factor for overall mortality as well as for currently accepted CaP treatment outcomes (biochemical failure, treatment failure, distant metastasis, and disease-specific mortality). The associations of smoking status with these outcomes were tested by Cox proportional hazard analyses. A total of 153 (8%) patients died during follow-up. Current smoking at diagnosis was a statistically significant predictor of overall mortality after RP (current smokers vs. former and never smokers, hazards ratio 2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.36-3.14). This association persisted for overall mortality at 3, 5, and 10 years (odds ratios 2.07 [95% CI: 1.36-3.15], 2.05 [95% CI: 1.35-3.12], and 1.8 [95% CI: 1.18-2.74], respectively). Smoking was not associated with biochemical failure, treatment failure, distant metastasis, or CaP-specific mortality, and the association of smoking with overall mortality did not appear to be functionally related to treatment or biochemical failure, or to distant metastasis.

Methods:   Questionnaires were sent to partners of disease-free PCa survivors. Outcomes included FCR severity (Cancer Worry Scale [CWS]) and HRQoL (RAND-36). The t and chi-square tests were used to compare partner FCR with survivor FCR. Regression analyses were performed to determine if demographic and clinical characteristics were significantly associated with partner FCR. The multivariate analysis of variance identified differences in HRQoL between partners with high and low FCR.  Results:   Questionnaires were completed by 168 partners.

Patients and methods:   All patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were discussed in a specialist multidisciplinary team meeting and were prospectively entered in a database. Patients were categorised based on D'Amico classification. All intermediate- and high-risk patients had pelvic magnetic resonance imaging and BS unless contraindicated. The BS positivity in each group was analysed and the negative predictive value (NPV) calculated. A cohort of 2720 patients between 2002 and 2015 was retrospectively analysed.  Results:   Of 976 patients in the D'Amico intermediate-risk category, 99 had primary Gleason pattern 4. Only one of the 99 patients had a positive BS and there were no positive BS in patients with Gleason primary pattern 3 in the intermediate-risk category. On subgroup analysis, based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and Gleason grade alone, the BS-positivity rate in patients with a PSA level of <20 ng/mL and Gleason primary pattern 4 vs 3 was 6% and 0%, respectively, resulting in 100% NPV for a positive BS with Gleason primary pattern 3 and a PSA level of <20 ng/mL. The importance of clinical T stage (cT) was also noted, as eight of 146 patients had positive BS, who were high risk on cT stage, with a PSA level of <20 ng/mL and Gleason score <8. All eight patients had Gleason primary pattern 4. By limiting BS to the population at risk (all high-risk + intermediate-risk with primary pattern 4), 68 BS per year could have been avoided in a single centre. A limitation was that there was no histological confirmation of bony metastases. Extending the BS recommendation considering the new Gleason Grade Grouping is discussed.  Conclusion:   This study confirms that a staging BS can be safely avoided in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer with Gleason primary pattern 3 and to limit performing BS in all high-risk prostate cancer and in the intermediate-risk group when the primary Gleason pattern is 4, thereby reinforcing the current recommendations of the EAU guidelines.""","""['Gokul V KandaSwamy', 'Adam Bennett', 'Krishna Narahari', 'Owen Hughes', 'John Rees', 'Howard Kynaston']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Which patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer need a radionuclide bone scan?

Methods:   We prospectively collected a database of all patients undergoing TURP and PVP for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) at a tertiary hospital between January 2011 and December 2013. Patient characteristics such as length of stay, readmission, anticoagulation status, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score and need for blood transfusion were recorded and analysed.  Results:   In total, 560 cases were included: 204 (36.4%) underwent TURP and 356 (63.6%) PVP. Patients undergoing PVP had higher ASA scores (P < 0.001) and were more frequently on continuing anticoagulant therapy (P < 0.001). With regards to non-aspirin/asasantin coagulation therapy, 61 (17.1%) patients underwent PVP with their anticoagulants continued while no patients who received TURP continued anticoagulation. Blood transfusion percentages were similar at 1.0% for TURP and 1.7% for PVP but readmission proportions were higher after PVP (32 patients, 9.0%) compared to TURP (10 patients, 4.9%). These differences were attenuated when excluding patients continuing anticoagulation during the procedure.  Conclusion:   At our institution, the use of PVP has been increasing on a year-by-year basis. The results of the current study demonstrated that PVP is safe in patients with increased anaesthetic risk or on active anticoagulation when compared to traditional TURP.

Exact knowledge of the relapse location may result in changes of the therapy concept aside from changes to the TNM stage. To gain data for this approach, we evaluated PC patients receiving 68 Ga-PSMA-PET imaging before salvage radiotherapy (RT).  Methods and materials:   In this study, 100 patients with biochemical failure after RP± prior RT who underwent 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT or PET/MRI were evaluated undergoing salvage RT in our department. We analyzed TNM staging changes due to 68 Ga-PSMA-PET imaging and its influence on RT planning and treatment.  Results:   Uptake indicative for tumor recurrence in 68 Ga-PSMA-PET was found in 76% of the patients with biochemical recurrent PC. Median PSA level was 1.0 ng/mL (range 0.12-14.7 ng/mL). Of these, 80% showed no morphological correlate in the corresponding CT or MRI. A 43% of all patients experienced a change in TNM stage due to 68 Ga-PSMA-PET imaging. Patients had changes from Tx to rcT+ (28%), 12% from pN0 to rcN1, 1% from pN0/cM0 to rcM1a, and 8% from cM0 to rcM1b. Due to the additional knowledge of 68 Ga-PSMA-PET imaging, initial planned RT planning was adapted in 59% of all cases. An additional simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to the prostate bed or lymph nodes was given to 32% and 63%, respectively. Ten patients received stereotactic body RT (SBRT) to single bone metastases.  Conclusion: 68 Ga-PSMA-PET imaging showed a high clinical impact on staging and RT management in patients with biochemically recurrent PC, even at low serum PSA levels.

Here, we investigated whether these same SNPs are associated with risk of lower- and higher-grade prostate cancer in men randomized to finasteride, and with prevalence of intraprostatic inflammation among controls. Methods A total of 16 candidate SNPs in IL1β, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12(p40), IFNG, MSR1, RNASEL, TLR4, and TNFA and 7 tagSNPs in IL10 were genotyped in 625 white prostate cancer cases, and 532 white controls negative for cancer on an end-of-study biopsy nested in the PCPT finasteride arm. We used logistic regression to estimate log-additive odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusting for age and family history.  Results:   Minor alleles of rs2243250 (T) in IL4 (OR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.03-2.08, P-trend = 0.03), rs1800896 (G) in IL10 (OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.96, P-trend = 0.02), rs2430561 (A) in IFNG (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.74; P-trend = 0.04), rs3747531 (C) in MSR1 (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.95; P-trend = 0.03), and possibly rs4073 (A) in IL8 (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.64-1.01, P-trend = 0.06) were associated with higher- (Gleason 7-10; N = 222), but not lower- (Gleason 2-6; N = 380) grade prostate cancer. In men with low PSA (<2 ng/mL), these higher-grade disease associations were attenuated and/or no longer significant, whereas associations with higher-grade disease were apparent for minor alleles of rs1800795 (C: OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.94, P-trend = 0.02) and rs1800797 (A: OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98, P-trend = 0.04) in IL6. While some IL10 tagSNPs were associated with lower- and higher-grade prostate cancer, distributions of IL10 haplotypes did not differ, except possibly between higher-grade cases and controls among those with low PSA (P = 0.07). We did not observe an association between the studied SNPs and intraprostatic inflammation in the controls.  Conclusion:   In the PCPT finasteride arm, variation in genes involved in the immune response, including possibly IL8 and IL10 as in the placebo arm, may be associated with prostate cancer, especially higher-grade disease, but not with intraprostatic inflammation.

To decrease the toxic effects on healthy cells, RT is usually delivered over a period of weeks in a series of fractions. This allows tumour cells to repair sublethal damage (RSD) caused by radiation. In this article, we introduce a stochastic model for tumour response to radiotherapy which accounts for the effects of RSD. The tumour is subdivided into two cell types: 'affected' cells which have been damaged by RT and 'unaffected' cells which have not. The model is formulated as a birth-death process for which we can derive an explicit formula for the TCP. We apply our model to prostate cancer, and find that the radiosensitivity parameters and the probability of sublethal damage during radiation are the parameters to which the TCP predictions are most sensitive.

Intrafractional prostate motion can occur unpredictably during the treatment and lead to target miss. This work investigated the dosimetric benefit of motion compensation with dynamic treatment-couch tracking for prostate SBRT treatments in the presence of prostatic motion.  Methods:   Ten SBRT treatment plans for prostate cancer patients with integrated boosts to their index lesion were prepared. The treatment plans were applied with a TrueBeam linear accelerator to a phantom in (a) static reference position, (b) moved with five prostate motion trajectories without any motion compensation, and (c) with real-time compensation using transponder-guided couch tracking. The geometrical position of the electromagnetic transponder was evaluated in the tracked and untracked situation. The dosimetric performance of couch tracking was evaluated, using Gamma agreement indices (GAI) and other dose parameters. These were evaluated within the phantoms biplanar diode array, as well as target- and organ-specific.  Results:   The root-mean-square error of the motion traces (range: 0.8-4.4 mm) was drastically reduced with couch tracking (0.2-0.4 mm). Residual motion was mainly observed at abrupt direction changes with steep motion gradients. The phantom measurements showed significantly better GAI1%/1mm with tracked (range: 83.4%-100.0%) than with untracked motion (28.9%-99.7%). Also GAI2%/2mm was significantly superior for the tracked (98.4%-100.0%) than the untracked motion (52.3%-100.0%). The organ-specific evaluation showed significantly better target coverage with tracking. The dose to the rectum and bladder showed a dependency on the anterior-posterior motion direction.  Conclusions:   Couch tracking clearly improved the dosimetric accuracy of prostate SBRT treatments. The treatment couch was able to compensate the prostatic motion with only some minor residual motion. Therefore, couch tracking combined with electromagnetic position monitoring for prostate SBRT is feasible and improves the accuracy in treatment delivery when prostate motion is present.""","""['Stefanie Ehrbar', 'Simon Schmid', 'Alexander Jöhl', 'Stephan Klöck', 'Matthias Guckenberger', 'Oliver Riesterer', 'Stephanie Tanadini-Lang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.', 'Electromagnetic guided couch and multileaf collimator tracking on a TrueBeam accelerator.', 'Comparison of multi-leaf collimator tracking and treatment-couch tracking during stereotactic body radiation therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Intrafractional motion management in external beam radiotherapy.', 'Estimating dose delivery accuracy in stereotactic body radiation therapy: A review of in-vivo measurement methods.', 'Dynamic intrafractional position monitoring with implanted fiducial markers for enhanced accuracy in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.', 'Technological quality requirements for stereotactic radiotherapy : Expert review group consensus from the DGMP Working Group for Physics and Technology in Stereotactic Radiotherapy.', 'Real-time intrafraction motion monitoring in external beam radiotherapy.', 'Optimization of training periods for the estimation model of three-dimensional target positions using an external respiratory surrogate.']"""

We developed a custom optimization script that could be applied automatically across modalities to eliminate operator bias during IMRT optimization.  Methods:   Four clinical cases were selected (prostate cancer, lung cancer, pediatric brain tumor, and head and neck cancer (HNC)). The VHEE beams were calculated in the EGSnrc/DOSXYZnrc Monte Carlo code for 100 and 200 MeV beams. Treatment plans with VHEE, VMAT, and PPBS were optimized in a research version of RayStation using an in-house developed script to minimize operator bias between the different techniques.  Results:   The in-house developed script generated similar or superior plans to the clinically used plans. In the comparisons between the modalities, the integral dose was lowest for the PPBS-generated plans in all cases. For the prostate case, the 200 MeV VHEE plan showed reduced integral dose and reduced organ at risk (OAR) dose compared to the VMAT plan. For all other cases, both the 100 and the 200 MeV VHEE plans were superior to the VMAT plans, and the VHEE plans showed better conformity and lower spinal cord dose in the pediatric brain case and lower brain stem dose in the HNC case when compared to the PPBS plan.  Conclusions:   The automated optimization developed in this study generated similar or superior plans as compared to the clinically used plan and represents an unbiased approach to compare treatment plans generated for different modalities. In the present study, we also show that VHEE plans are similar or superior to VMAT plans with reduced mean OAR dose and increased target conformity for a variety of clinical cases, and VHEE plans can even achieve reductions in OAR doses compared to PPBS plans for shallow targets. With increased VHEE energy, better conformity and even higher reductions in mean OAR doses are achieved. On the whole, VHEE was intermediate between photon VMAT and PPBS for OAR sparing.""","""['Emil Schüler', 'Kjell Eriksson', 'Elin Hynning', 'Steven L Hancock', 'Susan M Hiniker', 'Magdalena Bazalova-Carter', 'Tony Wong', 'Quynh-Thu Le', 'Billy W Loo Jr', 'Peter G Maxim']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Treatment planning for radiotherapy with very high-energy electron beams and comparison of VHEE and VMAT plans.', 'Assessment of the quality of very high-energy electron radiotherapy planning.', 'Enhanced optimization of volumetric modulated arc therapy plans using Monte Carlo generated beamlets.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'FLASH radiotherapy treatment planning and models for electron beams.', 'Frontiers in the Application of RF Vacuum Electronics.', 'Determination of the ion collection efficiency of the Razor Nano Chamber for ultra-high dose-rate electron beams.', 'Ultra-high dose rate radiation production and delivery systems intended for FLASH.', 'Deep Seated Tumour Treatments With Electrons of High Energy Delivered at FLASH Rates: The Example of Prostate Cancer.', 'Ultra-high dose rate electron beams and the FLASH effect: From preclinical evidence to a new radiotherapy paradigm.']"""

Although diagnosis modalities for primary prostate cancer have markedly improved, there are still no effective therapies for metastatic prostate cancer. SU6668 is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of three angiogenic receptors VEGFR2, PDGFRβ and FGFR1. There is strong experimental evidence that SU6668 can induce growth inhibition of various primary tumors. However, the function and molecular mechanism of SU6668 in prostate cancer has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we found that SU6668 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells. Functional studies also demonstrated that SU6668 inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition in DU145 and LNCap cells. After treatment with SU6668, MTDH protein, which has been reported to be significantly overexpressed in many human tumor tissues, was downregulated in DU145 and LNCap cells. siRNA-mediated silencing of MTDH in prostate cancer cells decreased their proliferation and invasive capabilities, suggesting that SU6668 may inhibit cell proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells partly through downstream targeting of MTDH. Mechanistic investigations showed that AKT signaling pathway was inhibited after SU6668 treatment in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, a combination of SU6668 and PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitor LY29004 resulted in increased inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion in DU145 cells. Taken together, our findings revealed that SU6668 suppressed prostate cancer progression by downregulating MTDH/AKT signaling pathway and identified a promising therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.""","""['Benjiang Qian', 'Yi Yao', 'Changming Liu', 'Jiabing Zhang', 'Huihong Chen', 'Huizhang Li']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['The combination of the tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor SU6668 with paclitaxel affects ascites formation and tumor spread in ovarian carcinoma xenografts growing orthotopically.', 'Activation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway promotes prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Combined antiangiogenic and immune therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of angiogenesis: treatment options for patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The role of MTDH/AEG-1 in the progression of cancer.', 'SNHG20 promotes the development of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma via miR-342-3p/MTDH axis.', 'The Multifaceted Roles of Mast Cells in Immune Homeostasis, Infections and Cancers.', 'MiR-9-3p regulates the biological functions and drug resistance of gemcitabine-treated breast cancer cells and affects tumor growth through targeting MTDH.', 'Lobaplatin inhibits breast cancer progression, cell proliferation while it induces cell apoptosis by downregulating MTDH expression.', 'miR-145 and miR-497 suppress TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of non-small cell lung cancer by targeting MTDH.']"""

However, without a proper biological understanding of the pleiotropic working of genetic variants, a fundamental assumption of Mendelian randomization (the exclusion restriction) can always be contested.  Methods:   We build upon and synthesize recent advances in the literature on instrumental variables (IVs) estimation that test and relax the exclusion restriction. Our pleiotropy-robust Mendelian randomization (PRMR) method first estimates the degree of pleiotropy, and in turn corrects for it. If (i) a subsample exists for which the genetic variants do not affect the exposure; (ii) the selection into this subsample is not a joint consequence of the IV and the outcome; (iii) pleiotropic effects are homogeneous, PRMR obtains unbiased estimates of causal effects.  Results:   Simulations show that existing MR methods produce biased estimators for realistic forms of pleiotropy. Under the aforementioned assumptions, PRMR produces unbiased estimators. We illustrate the practical use of PRMR by estimating the causal effect of: (i) tobacco exposure on body mass index (BMI); (ii) prostate cancer on self-reported health; and (iii) educational attainment on BMI in the UK Biobank data.  Conclusions:   PRMR allows for instrumental variables that violate the exclusion restriction due to pleiotropy, and it corrects for pleiotropy in the estimation of the causal effect.

TC patients have a good prognosis and a low disease-related mortality rate. Since such patients are often young, they may be at a higher risk for a second primary malignancy (SPM). This study sought to determine the incidence, risk, and types of SPM between 1980 and 2011, and to assess SPM trends over time among Israeli TC patients.  Methods:   Data were derived from the Israel National Cancer Registry. Primary TC patients diagnosed during 1980-2009 were followed up for SPM incidence until December 31, 2011. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of observed to expected SPM (based on the general population rates) were calculated using Poisson regression. Analyses were stratified by time period of initial TC diagnosis (1980-1995 and 1996-2009).  Results:   A total of 11,538 TC patients were identified. After exclusion of 107 duplicate cases, records of 1032 patients with SPM were analyzed (an SPM incidence of 8.9%). SIRs for all-site SPMs were 1.23 [confidence interval 1.08-1.35] for males and 1.19 [confidence interval 1.10-1.27] for females. SIRs for tumors of the urinary system and prostate were significantly elevated in males, as were SIRs for tumors of the brain, urinary system, breast, and lung in females. Variables associated with increased risk of developing SPMs included a younger age at TC diagnosis, a shorter latency period, being born in Asia/Africa for both sexes, and being born in Israel for females. Compared with the general population, a subanalysis by TC diagnosis during 1980-1995 and 1996-2009 disclosed a higher SPM incidence for the latter time period in males and for both time periods, with a slightly higher SIR for the latter time period in females.  Conclusions:   The overall risk of SPM in Israeli TC patients was significantly greater for both sexes compared with the general population, thus identifying TC patients as a high-risk group and calling for caretakers to apply specific follow-up guidelines.""","""['Elena Izkhakov', 'Micha Barchana', 'Irena Liphshitz', 'Barbara G Silverman', 'Naftali Stern', 'Lital Keinan-Boker']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Thyroid""","""['Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Second primary breast and thyroid cancers (Israel).', 'Increased risk of second primary malignancy in pediatric and young adult patients treated with radioactive iodine for differentiated thyroid cancer.', 'Second primary malignancy among cancer survivors - epidemiology, prognosis and clinical relevance.', 'Incidence of Second Primary Malignancies in Patients with Neuroendocrine Tumours.', 'Risk prediction of second primary malignant tumor in primary differentiated thyroid cancer patients: a population-based study.', 'Risk of second primary lung cancer in patients with thyroid cancer: a meta-analysis based on big population studies.', 'Association of Radioiodine for Differentiated Thyroid Cancer and Second Breast Cancer in Female Adolescent and Young Adult.', 'Risk of thyroid as a first or second primary cancer.

Thus, understanding the molecular pathways triggering the development of PC is crucial for both its prevention and treatment. Here, we investigated the role of the metabolism-associated protein, CREB3L4, in the proliferation of PC cells. CREB3L4 was upregulated by the synthetic androgen, R1881, in LNCaP PC cells (an androgen-dependent cell line). Knockdown of CREB3L4 resulted in decreased androgen-dependent PC cell growth. LNCaP cells transfected with siCREB3L4 underwent G2/M arrest, with upregulation of the proteins cyclin B1, phospho-CDK1, p21Waf1/Cip1, and INCA1, and downregulation of cyclin D1. Moreover, depletion of CREB3L4 resulted in significantly decreased expression of a subset of androgen-receptor (AR) target genes, including PSA, FKBP5, HPGD, KLK2, and KLK4. We also demonstrated that CREB3L4 directly interacts with the AR, and increases the binding of AR to androgen response elements (AREs).

However, the functions of SAM domains in Eph receptors remain elusive. Here we report on a combined cell biology and quantitative fluorescence study to investigate the role of the SAM domain in EphA2 function. We observed elevated tyrosine autophosphorylation levels upon deletion of the EphA2 SAM domain (EphA2ΔS) in DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells and a skin tumor cell line derived from EphA1/A2 knockout mice. These results suggest that SAM domain deletion induced constitutive activation of EphA2 kinase activity. In order to explain these effects, we applied fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to investigate the lateral molecular organization of EphA2. Our results indicate that SAM domain deletion (EphA2ΔS-GFP) increases oligomerization compared to the full length receptor (EphA2FL-GFP). Stimulation with ephrinA1, a ligand for EphA2, induced further oligomerization and activation of EphA2FL-GFP. The SAM domain deletion mutant, EphA2ΔS-GFP, also underwent further oligomerization upon ephrinA1 stimulation, but the oligomers were larger than those observed for EphA2FL-GFP. Based on these results, we conclude that the EphA2 SAM domain inhibits kinase activity by reducing receptor oligomerization.""","""['Xiaojun Shi', 'Vera Hapiak', 'Ji Zheng', 'Jeannine Muller-Greven', 'Deanna Bowman', 'Ryan Lingerak', 'Matthias Buck', 'Bing-Cheng Wang', 'Adam W Smith']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['The SAM domain inhibits EphA2 interactions in the plasma membrane.', 'Ligand recognition by A-class Eph receptors: crystal structures of the EphA2 ligand-binding domain and the EphA2/ephrin-A1 complex.', 'Biological and structural characterization of glycosylation on ephrin-A1, a preferred ligand for EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase.', 'The Sam Domain of EphA2 Receptor and its Relevance to Cancer: A Novel Challenge for Drug Discovery?', 'Roles of EphA1/A2 and ephrin-A1 in cancer.', 'Overexpression of hepatocyte EphA2 enhances liver-stage infection by Plasmodium vivax.', 'Hunting for Novel Routes in Anticancer Drug Discovery: Peptides against Sam-Sam Interactions.', 'Regulation of the EphA2 receptor intracellular region by phosphomimetic negative charges in the kinase-SAM linker.', 'Mutation of the EPHA2 Tyrosine-Kinase Domain Dysregulates Cell Pattern Formation and Cytoskeletal Gene Expression in the Lens.', 'Structural and Functional Insights into the Transmembrane Domain Association of Eph Receptors.']"""

For instance, miR-888-5p is up-regulated in prostate cancer and breast cancer. Nevertheless, the role of miR-888-5p in HCC has not been investigated to date. In this study, we found that miR-888-5p levels in four HCC cell lines (SMMC7721, HepG2, Huh-7 and Bel7402) were significantly up-regulated compared with human hepatocyte cell line (HHL-5). After transiently transfected with miR-888-5p mimic, our results demonstrated that miR-888-5p plays a major role in promoting the proliferation and metastatic potential of HCC cells. Moreover, miR-888-5p also increased the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins which account for cell migration and invasion, and decreased the expression of p53 protein which further promoted malignance of HCC.

These experiments are used in many applications including drug design for the treatment of cancer and chronic wounds. To provide insights into the mechanisms that drive scratch assays, solutions of continuum reaction-diffusion models have been calibrated to data from scratch assays. These models typically include a logistic source term to describe carrying capacity-limited proliferation; however, the choice of using a logistic source term is often made without examining whether it is valid. Here we study the proliferation of PC-3 prostate cancer cells in a scratch assay. All experimental results for the scratch assay are compared with equivalent results from a proliferation assay where the cell monolayer is not scratched. Visual inspection of the time evolution of the cell density away from the location of the scratch reveals a series of sigmoid curves that could be naively calibrated to the solution of the logistic growth model. However, careful analysis of the per capita growth rate as a function of density reveals several key differences between the proliferation of cells in scratch and proliferation assays. Our findings suggest that the logistic growth model is valid for the entire duration of the proliferation assay. On the other hand, guided by data, we suggest that there are two phases of proliferation in a scratch assay; at short time, we have a disturbance phase where proliferation is not logistic, and this is followed by a growth phase where proliferation appears to be logistic. These two phases are observed across a large number of experiments performed at different initial cell densities. Overall our study shows that simply calibrating the solution of a continuum model to a scratch assay might produce misleading parameter estimates, and this issue can be resolved by making a distinction between the disturbance and growth phases. Repeating our procedure for other scratch assays will provide insight into the roles of the disturbance and growth phases for different cell lines and scratch assays performed on different substrates.""","""['Wang Jin', 'Esha T Shah', 'Catherine J Penington', 'Scott W McCue', 'Philip K Maini', 'Matthew J Simpson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Bull Math Biol""","""['Age Structure Can Account for Delayed Logistic Proliferation of Scratch Assays.', 'Estimating cell diffusivity and cell proliferation rate by interpreting IncuCyte ZOOM™ assay data using the Fisher-Kolmogorov model.', 'Discrete and Continuum Approximations for Collective Cell Migration in a Scratch Assay with Cell Size Dynamics.', 'Therapeutic candidates for keloid scars identified by qualitative review of scratch assay research for wound healing.', 'An accurate and cost-effective alternative method for measuring cell migration with the circular wound closure assay.', 'Computationally efficient framework for diagnosing, understanding and predicting biphasic population growth.', 'Computationally efficient mechanism discovery for cell invasion with uncertainty quantification.', 'A noble extended stochastic logistic model for cell proliferation with density-dependent parameters.', 'A Continuum Mathematical Model of Substrate-Mediated Tissue Growth.', 'Population Dynamics with Threshold Effects Give Rise to a Diverse Family of Allee Effects.']"""

Treatment with SM increased the expression of p53 and reduced the expression of Bcl-2 proteins. The levels of PSA were considerably reduced in SM-treated group compared to the controls, and a decrease in AR expression was observed when cells were treated with SM in the same pattern as a reduction in PSA.

To identify risk factors for renal toxicity, we used Pearson's correlation coefficient and the corresponding p values.  Results:   None of the 55 patients experienced severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4). In 14 patients (25%), we observed increased creatinine levels of CTC 1° or 2°.

Activation of SGK1 in the heart causes a marked increase in both the peak and late sodium currents leading to prolongation of the action potential duration and an increased propensity to arrhythmia.

To identify downstream targets of GWAS-detected cancer risk genes we used MedScan, which is a text mining tool offered by PathwayStudio. We also used data on protein/protein interactions reported by BioGRID database. Among all identified targets we have selected common downstream targets. A gene was considered a common downstream target if it was a downstream target for at least three GWAS-detected genes for a given cancer type. Common downstream targets were identified separately for each cancer type. We found that common downstream targets for all four cancer types were enriched by cell cycle genes, more specifically, the genes involved in G1/S transition. Common downstream targets for bipolar disorder, Crohn's disease, and type 2 diabetes did not show G1/S transition enrichment.The results of this analysis suggest that many cancer risk genes function as upstream regulators of the genes directly involved in G1/S transition and exert their risk effects by reducing threshold for G1/S transition, elevating the background level of cell proliferation and cancer risk.""","""['Olga Y Gorlova', 'Eugene I Demidenko', 'Christopher I Amos', 'Ivan P Gorlov']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Hum Mol Genet""","""['Pathway Analysis of Genes Identified through Post-GWAS to Underpin Prostate Cancer Aetiology.', 'A Cross-Cancer Genetic Association Analysis of the DNA Repair and DNA Damage Signaling Pathways for Lung, Ovary, Prostate, Breast, and Colorectal Cancer.', 'Genetic associations of breast and prostate cancer are enriched for regulatory elements identified in disease-related tissues.', 'A Review of Prostate Cancer Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).', 'Genome-wide germline analyses on cancer susceptibility and GeMDBJ database: Gastric cancer as an example.', 'Comprehensive analysis of differential expression profiles reveals potential biomarkers associated with the cell cycle and regulated by p53 in human small cell lung cancer.']"""

Methods:   In this Phase II, open-label, parallel-group study, 155 Japanese prostate cancer patients were randomized to treatment with degarelix administered subcutaneously at a maintenance dose of 360 or 480 mg every 84 days for 12 months, after receiving an initial dose of 240 mg. The primary endpoint was the cumulative probability of serum testosterone ≤0.5 ng/ml (Days 28-364). Secondary endpoints included percent change in serum prostate-specific antigen level and proportion of patients with prostate-specific antigen failure at Day 364. For safety, adverse events were evaluated.  Results:   The cumulative probability of serum testosterone ≤0.5 ng/ml (Days 28-364) was 88.3% (95% confidence interval: 77.9-94.0%) and 97.2% (95% confidence interval: 89.4-99.3%) in the 360 and 480 mg groups, respectively.

The most frequent adverse event was injection site reaction; however, this did not cause any patient to discontinue treatment.  Conclusions:   The 3-month dosing regimen of degarelix 360/480 mg was effective and well tolerated for treatment of Japanese prostate cancer patients.

Docetaxel treatment inevitably leads to tumour recurrence after an initial therapeutic response with generation of multinucleated polyploid (MP) cells. Here we investigated role of MP cells in clinical relapse of CRPC.  Methods:   Prostate cancer (PC-3) cells were treated with docetaxel (5 nM) for 3 days followed by a washout and samples were collected at close intervals over 35 days post drug washout. The tumorigenic potential of the giant MP cells was studied by implanting MP cells subcutaneously as tumour xenografts in nude mice.  Results:   Docetaxel-induced polyploid cells undergo mitotic slippage and eventually spawn mononucleated cells via asymmetric cell division or neosis. Both MP and cells derived from polyploid cells had increased survival signals, were positive for CD44 and were resistant to docetaxel chemotherapy. Although MP cells were tumorigenic in nude mice, these cells took a significantly longer time to form tumours compared with parent PC-3 cells.  Conclusions:   Generation of MP cells upon docetaxel therapy is an adaptive response of apoptosis-reluctant cells. These giant cells ultimately contribute to the generation of mononucleated aneuploid cells via neosis and may have a fundamental role precipitating clinical relapse and chemoresistance in CRPC.""","""['Karuna Mittal', 'Shashi Donthamsetty', 'Ramneet Kaur', 'Chunhua Yang', 'Meenakshi V Gupta', 'Michelle D Reid', 'Da Hoon Choi', 'Padmashree C G Rida', 'Ritu Aneja']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['EGFR mediates docetaxel resistance in human castration-resistant prostate cancer through the Akt-dependent expression of ABCB1 (MDR1).', 'The Effects and Mechanism of YK-4-279 in Combination with Docetaxel on Prostate Cancer.', 'NPRL2 promotes docetaxel chemoresistance in castration resistant prostate cancer cells by regulating autophagy through the mTOR pathway.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging targets to monitor and overcome docetaxel resistance in castration resistant prostate cancer (review).', 'IL-1β is involved in docetaxel chemoresistance by regulating the formation of polyploid giant cancer cells in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Targeting polyploid giant cancer cells potentiates a therapeutic response and overcomes resistance to PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer.', 'Necroptosis Induced by Delta-Tocotrienol Overcomes Docetaxel Chemoresistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Cancer Cells Enter an Adaptive Persistence to Survive Radiotherapy and Repopulate Tumor.', 'Presence of cells in the polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state predicts the risk of recurrence in prostate cancer.']"""

As one of the physical quantities describing the particle spectrum of charged-particle beams, we considered the linear energy transfer (LET) throughout this study. We investigated a new therapeutic technique using two or more ion species in one treatment session, which we call an intensity modulated composite particle therapy (IMPACT), for optimizing the physical dose and dose-averaged LET distributions in a patient as its proof of principle. Protons and helium, carbon, and oxygen ions were considered as ion species for IMPACT. For three cubic targets of 4 × 4 × 4, 8 × 8 × 8, and 12 × 12 × 12 cm3, defined at the center of the water phantom of 20 × 20 × 20 cm3, we made IMPACT plans of two composite fields with opposing and orthogonal geometries. The prescribed dose to the target was fixed at 1 Gy, while the prescribed LET to the target was varied from 1 keV µm-1 to 120 keV µm-1 to investigate the range of LET valid for prescription. The minimum and maximum prescribed LETs, (L T_min, L T_max), by the opposing-field geometry, were (3 keV µm-1, 115 keV µm-1), (2 keV µm-1, 84 keV µm-1),and (2 keV µm-1, 66 keV µm-1), while those by the orthogonal-field geometry were (8 keV µm-1, 98 keV µm-1), (7 keV µm-1, 72 keV µm-1), and (8 keV µm-1, 57 keV µm-1) for the three targets, respectively. To show the proof of principle of IMPACT in a clinical situation, we made IMPACT plans for a prostate case. In accordance with the prescriptions, the LETs in prostate, planning target volume (PTV), and rectum could be adjusted at 80 keV µm-1, at 50 keV µm-1, and below 30 keV µm-1, respectively, while keeping the dose to the PTV at 2 Gy uniformly. IMPACT enables the optimization of the dose and the LET distributions in a patient, which will maximize the potential of charged-particle therapy by expanding the therapeutic window.

This syndrome is diagnosed in men who, for no discernible reason other than older age, obesity or ill health have serum testosterone concentrations below the normal range for healthy young men and report one or more of the following symptoms: muscle weakness or wasting, mood, behaviour and cognition-related symptoms and sexual function or libido impairment. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that testosterone drugs do not substantially ameliorate these symptoms and, more worryingly, that their long-term use may be associated with severe adverse effects (i.e. increased risk of prostate cancer, stroke and myocardial infarction, worsening of benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms and testicular atrophy). Nonetheless, testosterone drugs have exhibited extraordinary commercial success and their pharmaceutical sales are steadily rising. Behind this apparently unjustifiable trend there are deliberate, well designed direct and indirect pharmaceutical marketing initiatives that exploit the conviction rooted in contemporary society that testosterone can reverse the effects of ageing and ensure social accomplishment. Commercial mechanisms have laid the foundation for disease mongering of LOH and also have resulted a considerable expansion of the indications for treatment.

In this study, the expression of SLC12A5 was examined in clinical specimens of primary BUC and in BUC cell lines using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The prognostic value of SLC12A5 expression and its correlation with the clinicopathological features of patients with BUC were analyzed statistically. A series of in vitro and in vivo assays were performed to elucidate the effect of SLC12A5 in BUC and its underlying mechanisms. The present results showed that SLC12A5 expression was significantly increased in BUC tissues. SLC12A5 expression significantly correlated with the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that high SLC12A5 expression was associated with poor survival in patients with BUC. Multivariate analysis indicated that SLC12A5 expression was an independent prognostic marker for the survival of patients. Downregulation of SLC12A5 inhibited the migratory and invasive abilities of BUC cells in vitro, and knocking down SLC12A5 diminished BUC metastasis in vivo. Moreover, we identified that SLC12A5 promoted the migration and invasion of BUC by enhancing MMP-7 expression via NF-κB-dependent transcription. Taken together, our findings indicated that SLC12A5 might function as a tumor metastasis promoting factor in the development and progression of BUC by regulating the NF-κB/MMP-7 signaling pathway.

Methods and materials:   This was a retrospective, single-institution study of 32 patients with suspected prostate cancer recurrence who underwent both FCH-PET/CT and 3T mpMRI within 3 months of one another for the detection of recurrence. All included patients had to be cleared for metastatic recurrence. The reference procedure was systematic 3-dimensional (3D)-transperineal prostate biopsy for the final assessment of local recurrence. Both imaging modalities were analyzed by 2 experienced readers blinded to clinical data. The analysis was made per-patient and per-segment using a 4-segment model.  Results:   The median prostate-specific antigen value at the time of imaging was 2.92 ng/mL. The mean prostate-specific antigen doubling time was 14 months. Of the 32 patients, 31 had a positive 3D-transperineal mapping biopsy for a local relapse. On a patient-based analysis, the detection rate was 71% (22 of 31) for mpMRI and 74% (23 of 31) for FCH-PET/CT. On a segment-based analysis, the sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 32% and 87% for mpMRI, 34% and 87% for FCH-PET/CT, and 43% and 83% for the combined analysis of both techniques.

The present study sought to determine the influence of MRI-Bx on radiation therapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) recommendations.  Methods and materials:   All patients who had received radiation treatment and had undergone SOC-Bx and MRI-Bx at our institution were included. Using the clinical T stage, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score, patients were categorized into National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk groups and radiation treatment or ADT recommendations assigned. Intensification of the recommended treatment after multiparametric MRI, SOC-Bx, and MRI-Bx was evaluated.  Results:   From January 2008 to January 2016, 73 patients received radiation therapy at our institution after undergoing a simultaneous SOC-Bx and MRI-Bx (n=47 with previous SOC-Bx). Repeat SOC-Bx and MRI-Bx resulted in frequent upgrading compared with previous SOC-Bx (Gleason score 7, 6.7% vs 44.6%; P<.001; Gleason score 8-10, 2.1% vs 38%; P<.001). MRI-Bx increased the proportion of patients classified as very high risk from 24.7% to 41.1% (P=.027). Compared with SOC-Bx alone, including the MRI-Bx findings resulted in a greater percentage of pathologically positive cores (mean 37% vs 44%). Incorporation of multiparametric MRI and MRI-Bx results increased the recommended use and duration of ADT (duration increased in 28 of 73 patients and ADT was added for 8 of 73 patients).

Methods and materials:   Seventy-one patients with T1N0M0 to T4N0M0 prostate cancer were enrolled, and their ProstaScint and pelvic computed tomography scans were coregistered for treatment planning. The entire prostate received 75.6 Gy in 42 fractions with IMRT, whereas regions of increased uptake on ProstaScint scans received 82 Gy as an SIB. Patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease also received 6 months and 12 months of adjuvant hormonal therapy, respectively.  Results:   The study enrolled 31 low-, 30 intermediate-, and 10 high-risk patients. The median follow-up was 120 months (range, 24-150 months). The 10-year biochemical control rates were 85% for the entire cohort and 84%, 84%, and 90% for patients with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease, respectively. The 10-year survival rate of the entire cohort was 69%. Pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level >10 ng/mL and boost volume of >10% of the prostate volume were significantly associated with poorer biochemical control and survival. The outcomes were compared with those of a cohort of 302 patients treated similarly but without the SIB and followed up for a median of 91 months (range, 6-138 months). The 5- and 10-year biochemical control rates were 86% and 61%, respectively, in patients without the SIB compared with 94% and 85%, respectively, in patients in this trial who received the SIB (P=.02). The cohort that received an SIB did not have increased toxicity.  Conclusions:   The described IMRT strategy, integrating multiple imaging modalities to administer 75.6 Gy to the entire prostate with a boost dose of 82 Gy, was feasible. The addition of the SIB was associated with greater biochemical control but not toxicity. Modern imaging technology can be used to locally intensify the dose to tumors and spare normal tissues, producing very favorable long-term biochemical disease control.""","""['Michael H Schild', 'Steven E Schild', 'William W Wong', 'Sujay A Vora', 'Sameer R Keole', 'Carlos E Vargas', 'Thomas B Daniels', 'Gary A Ezzell', 'Ba D Nguyen', 'Michael C Roarke']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a prospective trial of concomitant boost using indium-111-capromab pendetide (ProstaScint) imaging.', 'Long-term Tumor Control and Late Toxicity in Patients with Prostate Cancer Receiving Hypofractionated (2.2 Gy) Soft-tissue-matched Image-guided Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy.', 'Impact of image guidance on toxicity and tumour outcome in moderately hypofractionated external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: what treatment techniques for which tumors?

BPH and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia often coexist in elderly people. We identified which comorbidities can be used to predict the presence of incidental prostate cancer, particularly high-risk cancer, in men who had undergone HoLEP. On the basis of pathological findings of HoLEP specimens, patients with incidental cancer were categorized as low-risk (Gleason ≤6 and T1a) or high-risk (all others). Of the 654 patients who underwent HoLEP, 41 patients (6.3%) were identified as having incidental cancer (25 low-risk and 16 high-risk). There were no significant factors for overall prostate cancers. However, a significantly higher frequency of diabetes was observed in patients with high-risk cancer compared to those with BPH (31% vs. 13%; p = .033). Logistic regression analysis using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate volume (PV), and smoking showed that diabetes was an independent predictor of high-risk cancer (odds ratio, 3.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-9.43).

PML NBs coordinate chromosomal regions via modification of nuclear proteins that in turn may regulate genes in the vicinity of these bodies. However, few PML NB-associated genes have been identified. PML and PML NBs can also regulate mTOR and cell fate decisions in response to cellular stresses. We now demonstrate that PML depletion in U2OS cells or TERT-immortalized normal human diploid fibroblasts results in decreased expression of the mTOR inhibitor DDIT4 (REDD1). DNA and RNA immuno-FISH reveal that PML NBs are closely associated with actively transcribed DDIT4 loci, implicating these bodies in regulation of basal DDIT4 expression. Although PML silencing did reduce the sensitivity of U2OS cells to metabolic stress induced by metformin, PML loss did not inhibit the upregulation of DDIT4 in response to metformin, hypoxia-like (CoCl2) or genotoxic stress. Analysis of publicly available cancer data also revealed a significant correlation between PML and DDIT4 expression in several cancer types (e.g. lung, breast, prostate).

We examined long-term survival of men aged 80 years or older treated with RP and we attempted to identify criteria based on age and comorbidities that could predict survival of at least 10 years after RP, to identify those that might be considered for RP.  Patients and methods:   In Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked database, we identified 234 octo- and nonagenarians with clinical T1, T2 or T3 PCa treated with RP between 1991 and 2009. Kaplan-Meier analyses examined 10-year survival patterns. Multivariable Cox regression analyses focused on the combined effect of age and/or Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) after adjusting for different confounders.  Results:   The 10-year overall survival (OS) and cancer specific mortality (CSM) rates in the overall population were 51 and 9.9%.

There is a critical need for identification of biomarkers that can more accurately stratify patients with primary PCa.  Objective:   To identify a robust prognostic signature to better distinguish indolent from aggressive prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   To develop the signature, whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing was conducted on five PCa patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models collected from independent foci of a single primary tumor and exhibiting variable metastatic phenotypes. Multiple independent clinical cohorts including an intermediate-risk cohort were used to validate the biomarkers.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The outcome measurement defining aggressive PCa was metastasis following radical prostatectomy. A generalized linear model with lasso regularization was used to build a 93-gene stroma-derived metastasis signature (SDMS). The SDMS association with metastasis was assessed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic, and Kaplan-Meier curves. Univariable and multivariable regression models were used to compare the SDMS alongside clinicopathological variables and reported signatures. AUC was assessed to determine if SDMS is additive or synergistic to previously reported signatures.  Results and limitations:   A close association between stromal gene expression and metastatic phenotype was observed. Accordingly, the SDMS was modeled and validated in multiple independent clinical cohorts. Patients with higher SDMS scores were found to have worse prognosis. Furthermore, SDMS was an independent prognostic factor, can stratify risk in intermediate-risk PCa, and can improve the performance of other previously reported signatures.  Conclusions:   Profiling of stromal gene expression led to development of an SDMS that was validated as independently prognostic for the metastatic potential of prostate tumors.  Patient summary:   Our stroma-derived metastasis signature can predict the metastatic potential of early stage disease and will strengthen decisions regarding selection of active surveillance versus surgery and/or radiation therapy for prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, profiling of stroma cells should be more consistent than profiling of diverse cellular populations of heterogeneous tumors.""","""['Fan Mo', 'Dong Lin', 'Mandeep Takhar', 'Varune Rohan Ramnarine', 'Xin Dong', 'Robert H Bell', 'Stanislav V Volik', 'Kendric Wang', 'Hui Xue', 'Yuwei Wang', 'Anne Haegert', 'Shawn Anderson', 'Sonal Brahmbhatt', 'Nicholas Erho', 'Xinya Wang', 'Peter W Gout', 'James Morris', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Robert B Den', 'Eric A Klein', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Ashley Ross', 'Shancheng Ren', 'S Cenk Sahinalp', 'Yingrui Li', 'Xun Xu', 'Jun Wang', 'Jian Wang', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Yinghao Sun', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Colin C Collins']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['A Partner in Crime: Tumor-associated Stroma and Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Tissue-based Genomics Augments Post-prostatectomy Risk Stratification in a Natural History Cohort of Intermediate- and High-Risk Men.', 'A genomic classifier improves prediction of metastatic disease within 5 years after surgery in node-negative high-risk prostate cancer patients managed by radical prostatectomy without adjuvant therapy.', 'A Biopsy-based 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score as a Predictor of Metastases and Prostate Cancer Death in Surgically Treated Men with Clinically Localized Disease.', 'Genomic Markers in Prostate Cancer Decision Making.', 'Variability in Outcomes for Patients with Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer (Gleason Score 7, International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason Group 2-3) and Implications for Risk Stratification: A Systematic Review.', 'Distinct mesenchymal cell states mediate prostate cancer progression.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.', 'RISING STARS: Heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'WNT1 Inducible Signaling Pathway Protein 1 Is a Stroma-Specific Secreting Protein Inducing a Fibroblast Contraction and Carcinoma Cell Growth in the Human Prostate.', 'Prostate Cancer Secretome and Membrane Proteome from Pten Conditional Knockout Mice Identify Potential Biomarkers for Disease Progression.']"""

To compare the clinical risk factors and metabolic variables as predictors of malignancy.  Methods:   Patients with persistently elevated PSA in serum (total PSA >4ng/mL) and at least a previous negative or inconclusive biopsy were consecutively referred for a whole body 18F-Choline PET/CT. Patient age, PSA level, PSA doubling time (PSAdt) and PSA velocity (PSAvel) were obtained. PET images were visually (positive or negative) and semiquantitatively (SUVmax) reviewed. 18F-Choline uptake prostate patterns were defined as focal, multifocal, homogeneous or heterogeneous. Histology on biopsy using transrectal ultrasound-guided approach was the gold standard. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and accuracy (Ac) of PET/CT for diagnosis of pCa were evaluated using per-patient and per-prostate lobe analysis. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the value of SUVmax to diagnose pCa. Correlation between PET/CT and biopsy results per-prostate lobe was assessed using the Chi-square test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were applied to compare clinical risk factors and metabolic variables as predictors of malignancy.  Results:   Thirty-six out of 43 patients with histologic confirmation were included. In 11 (30.5%) patients, pCa was diagnosed (Gleason score from 4 to 9). The mean values of patient age, PSA level, PSAdt and PSAvel were: 65.5 years, 15.6ng/ml, 28.1 months and 8.5ng/mL per year, respectively. Thirty-three patients had a positive PET/CT; 18 had a focal pattern, 7 multifocal, 4 homogeneous and 4 heterogeneous. Se, Sp and Ac of PET/CT were of 100%, 12% and 38% in the patient based analysis, and 87%, 29% and 14% in the prostate lobe based analysis, respectively. The ROC curve analysis of SUVmax showed an AUC of 0.568 (p=0.52). On a lobe analysis, poor agreement was observed between PET/CT findings and biopsy results (p=0.097). In the univariate/multivariate analysis, none of clinical and metabolic variables were statistically significant as predictor of pCa.  Conclusion:   Choline PET/CT is a suitable procedure for the detection of pCa in highly selected patients, however, a high rate of false positive should be expected.""","""['G A Jiménez Londoño', 'A M García Vicente', 'M Amo-Salas', 'F Fúnez Mayorga', 'M A López Guerrero', 'M P Talavera Rubio', 'P Gutierrez Martin', 'B González García', 'J A de la Torre Pérez', 'Á M Soriano Castrejón']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Clinical utility of (18)F-fluorocholine positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in biochemical relapse of prostate cancer after radical treatment: results of a multicentre study.', 'Oligometastatic recurrent prostate cancer detects by fluorine-18-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in patients with prostate-specific antigen levels of up to 5\u2009ng/ml.', 'Will 68Ga PSMA-radioligands be the only choice for nuclear medicine in prostate cancer in the near future?

Materials and methods:   We evaluated 30 consecutive men (median age, 65.7 years; interquartile range [IQR], 61.5-70.9 years) with a median prostatic specific antigen of 8.5ng/dL (IQR, 5.5-10.5ng/dL), who underwent MP-MRI before radical prostatectomy. Index tumor volume was determined prospectively and independently on the basis of MRI and whole-mount section volumetric assessment using the maximum histologic diameter (MHD) and the histologic volume (HV). The MRI index tumor volume was determined by two independent radiologists using a single measurement of the maximum tumor dimension (MTD), a simplified MR ellipsoid volume (MREV) calculation and a MR region of interest volume (MROV) segmentation displayed by a commercially available OsiriX®. MTD was compared to MHD, whereas MREV and MROV were compared to HV.  Results:   Thirty index lesions (median HV, 1.514 cm3; IQR, 0.05-3.780 cm3) were analyzed. The MREV, MROV and HD were significantly correlated with each other (r>0.5). Inter-observer agreement for measurements was good for each method (r>0.780). The MTD was the best predictor of maximum histologic diameter (r=0.980 and 0.791) and had an excellent inter-variability correlation (P<0.0001).  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer histologic volume can be assessed using MREV or MROV with a good accuracy and low inter-observer variability. MTD has the lowest inter-observer variability and provides best degrees of correlation with MHD.

Little is known about what determines the admission of patients to SPC and whether there are differences in relation to institution type. The aims of the study were to investigate whether cancer patients' admittance to SPC in Denmark varied in relation to sex, age and diagnosis, and whether the patterns differed by type of institution (hospital-based palliative care team/unit, hospice, or both).  Methods:   This was a register-based study of adult patients living in Denmark who died from cancer in 2010-2012. Data sources were the Danish Palliative Care Database, Danish Register of Causes of Death and Danish Cancer Registry. The associations between the explanatory variables (sex, age, diagnosis) and admittance to SPC were investigated using logistic regression.  Results:   In the study population (N = 44,548) the overall admittance proportion to SPC was 37%. Higher odds of overall admittance to SPC were found for women (OR = 1.23; 1.17-1.28), younger patients (<40 compared with 80+ years old) (OR = 6.44; 5.19-7.99) and patients with sarcoma, pancreatic and stomach cancers, whereas the lowest were for patients with haematological malignancies. The higher admission found for women was most pronounced for hospices compared to hospital-based palliative care teams/units, whereas higher admission of younger patients was more pronounced for hospital-based palliative care teams/units. Patients with brain cancer were more often admitted to hospices, whereas patients with prostate cancer were more often admitted to hospital-based palliative care teams/units.  Conclusion:   It is unlikely that the variations in relation to sex, age and cancer diagnoses can be fully explained by differences in need. Future research should investigate whether the groups having the lowest admittance to SPC receive sufficient palliative care elsewhere.""","""['Mathilde Adsersen', 'Lau Caspar Thygesen', 'Anders Bonde Jensen', 'Mette Asbjoern Neergaard', 'Per Sjøgren', 'Mogens Groenvold']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Palliat Care""","""['Higher overall admittance of immigrants to specialised palliative care in Denmark: a nationwide register-based study of 99,624 patients with cancer.', 'Admittance to specialized palliative care (SPC) of patients with an assessed need: a study from the Danish palliative care database (DPD).', 'Cohabitation Status Influenced Admittance to Specialized Palliative Care for Cancer Patients: A Nationwide Study from the Danish Palliative Care Database.', 'Specialized palliative care in Denmark lacks capacity and accessibility.', 'Danish Palliative Care Database.', 'Higher overall admittance of immigrants to specialised palliative care in Denmark: a nationwide register-based study of 99,624 patients with cancer.', 'The Landscape of Outpatient Palliative Care in Germany: Results from a Retrospective Analysis of 14,792 Patients.', 'Systematic Review and Meta-Synthesis about Patients with Hematological Malignancy and Palliative Care.', 'Use of Palliative Interventions at End of Life for Advanced Gastrointestinal Cancer.', 'Equal receipt of specialized palliative care in breast and prostate cancer: a register study.']"""

Methods:   Human prostate cancer DU145 cells were treated with different concentrations of fish oil, omega-3 PUFA (DHA, and Eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA), or omega-6 PUFA (Arachidonic acid, AA). Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT assay and Hoechst staining. Pathway-focused gene expression profiling of DU145 cells was analyzed with the RT2 Profile PCR Array System. The results were verified by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).  Results:   AA exposure showed no obvious effect on viability of DU145 cells. However, exposure with fish oil, EPA, or DHA for 24 h significantly affected cell viability. The growth inhibition of DHA was more pronounced than that of EPA and showed a time-dependent increase. DHA exposure caused typical apoptotic characteristics. Ten genes were more expressed, while 5 genes were less expressed following DHA exposure. RT-qPCR confirmed the time dependent effect of DHA on the expression of these differentially expressed genes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that DHA may induce the apoptosis of cancer cells preferentially through mediating P53, MAPK, TNF, PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB signaling pathways.  Conclusion:   Our study demonstrated the beneficial action of DHA on human prostate carcinoma cell line DU145. The pro-apoptotic effect of DHA on DU145 cells may involve mediation various pathways, especially P53, MAPK, TNF, PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB signaling pathways.

Consequently, a number of post-prostatectomy patients with previously undetectable PSA concentrations (defined as <0.03 μg/L in that laboratory) were being reported as having detectable PSA, which suggested poorer prognosis according to clinical guidelines.  Methods:   Through numerical simulations, we explored (1) how a small bias may evade the detection of routine quality control (QC) procedures with specific reference to the concentration of the QC material, (2) whether the use of 'average of normals' approach may detect such a small bias, and (3) describe the use of moving sum of number of patient results with detectable PSA as an adjunct QC procedure.  Results:   The lowest QC level (0.86 μg/L) available from a commercial kit had poor probability (<10%) of a bias of 0.03 μg/L regardless of QC rule (i.e. 1:2S, 2:2S, 1:3S, 4:1S) used. The average number of patient results affected before error detection (ANPed) was high when using the average of normals approach due to the relatively wide control limits. By contrast, the ANPed was significantly lower for the moving sum of number of patient results with a detectable PSA approach.  Conclusions:   Laboratory practitioners should ensure their QC strategy can detect small but critical bias, and may require supplementation of ultra-low QC levels that are not covered by commercial kits with in-house preparations.

With two tests, one can compare TPF and FPF using relative probabilities which offer advantages in terms of interpretation and statistical modeling. Our objective was to highlight how individual and relative TPF and FPF can be easily estimated and compared within a regression modeling framework. This allows the modeling of tests' accuracy while adjusting for multiple covariates, and thus provides valuable information in addition to the crude TPF and FPF. We illustrate our purpose with the G8 and VES-13 screening tests aimed at identifying elderly cancer patients in need for a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA).  Methods:   Prospective cohort with a paired design. TPF and FPF of each test, as well as relative TPF and FPF were modeled using log-linear models.  Results:   G8 detected patients in need for CGA better than VES-13 at the expense of misclassifying a large number of normal patients. Both tests had better TPF with older age and poorer performance status (PS), and for all cancer subtypes compared with prostate cancer. Effect of age and PS on TPF was more pronounced with VES-13. Age affected FPF, but not differentially.  Conclusions:   Regression modeling helps provide a thorough assessment of the accuracy of diagnostic tests and should be used more frequently. In the context of screening, we encourage the use of G8 as failing to identify patients in need of a CGA might be more problematic than over-detection.

Methods and materials:   A randomized clinical trial was initiated at our institution to compare the results and side effects of LDR and HDR BT as monotherapy in the treatment of early, organ-confined prostate cancer patients. Eighty-seven patients were randomly assigned to receive HDR afterloading BT with one fraction of 19 Gy or permanent LDR 125I seed BT with 145 Gy. Inverse optimization algorithms were used for planning. Stranded seeds were implanted using live ultrasound imaging after preimplant treatment planning. Final dosimetry of HDR treatments was based on updated needle and contour positions. Statistical comparisons with nonparametric test were performed between the corresponding dose-volume parameters.  Results:   The V100 and V150 were 99% and 61%, respectively, for LDR, whereas 98% and 32% for HDR treatments. The D90 was less for HDR (122% vs. 110%).

The multi-resolution nature of cancer pathology, however, has not been fully analyzed and utilized. Here, we develop an automated, cooperative, and multi-resolution method for improving prostate cancer diagnosis.  Methods:   Digitized tissue specimen images are obtained from 5 tissue microarrays (TMAs). The TMAs include 70 benign and 135 cancer samples (TMA1), 74 benign and 89 cancer samples (TMA2), 70 benign and 115 cancer samples (TMA3), 79 benign and 82 cancer samples (TMA4), and 72 benign and 86 cancer samples (TMA5). The tissue specimen images are segmented using intensity- and texture-based features. Using the segmentation results, a number of morphological features from lumens and epithelial nuclei are computed to characterize tissues at different resolutions. Applying a multiview boosting algorithm, tissue characteristics, obtained from differing resolutions, are cooperatively combined to achieve accurate cancer detection.  Results:   In segmenting prostate tissues, the multiview boosting method achieved≥ 0.97 AUC using TMA1. For detecting cancers, the multiview boosting method achieved an AUC of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99) as trained on TMA2 and tested on TMA3, TMA4, and TMA5. The proposed method was superior to single-view approaches, utilizing features from a single resolution or merging features from all the resolutions. Moreover, the performance of the proposed method was insensitive to the choice of the training dataset. Trained on TMA3, TMA4, and TMA5, the proposed method obtained an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.98), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96-0.99), and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.98), respectively.  Conclusions:   The multiview boosting method is capable of integrating information from multiple resolutions in an effective and efficient fashion and identifying cancers with high accuracy.

Several cases of ductal adenocarcinoma exhibiting a macrocystic appearance have recently been reported; however, the histological and clinicopathological characteristics of MPAs have yet to be characterized and established. Therefore, we aimed to determine the histological and clinicopathological characteristics of MPA, via a multi-institutional investigation. We discovered five patients with MPA out of 1559 treated patients (0.32%); all cases were ductal adenocarcinomas. MPA was found to have three growth patterns: Two cases showed a prevalence of exuberant papillary proliferation with a fibrovascular core in the macroscopic multilocular cysts. Two others predominantly exhibited multilocular cysts lined by flat epithelium with foci of low papillae, and the fifth had a cystic lesion with intracancerous necrosis. Three of the cases showed extraprostatic invasion; however, none of the patients experienced recurrence during the follow-up period. Each predominant growth pattern tended to exhibit unique clinicopathological characteristics with respect to serum prostate specific antigen level and tumor size and location.

GS 6 cancer exclusively with Gleason grade 3 is designated as low grade (LG) and correlates with better clinical prognosis for patients. GS >7 cancer with at least one of the Gleason grades 4 and 5 is designated as HG indicate worse prognosis for patients. Current transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies often fail to correctly diagnose HG prostate cancer due to sampling errors. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of biological tissue depend on tissue morphology and architecture. Thus, DRS could potentially differentiate between HG and LG prostatic carcinoma. A 15-gauge optical biopsy needle was prototyped to take prostate biopsies after measuring DRS with a laboratory fluorometer. This needle has an optical sensor that utilizes 8×100 μm optical fibers for tissue excitation and a single 200 μm central optical fiber to measure DRS. Tissue biopsy cores were obtained from 20 surgically excised prostates using this needle after measuring DRS at 5 nm intervals between 500-700 nm wavelengths. Tissue within a measurement window was histopathologically classified as either benign, LG, or HG and correlated with DRS. Partial least square analysis of DRS identified principal components (PC) as potential classifiers. Statistically significant PCs (p<;0.05) were tested for their ability to classify biopsy tissue using support vector machine and leave-one-out cross validation method. There were 29 HG and 49 LG cancers among 187 biopsy cores included in the study. Study results show 76% sensitivity, 80% specificity, 93% negative predictive value, and 50% positive predictive value for HG versus benign, and 76%, 73%, 84%, and 63%, for HG versus LG prostate tissue classification. DRS failed to diagnose 7/29 (24%) HG cancers. This study demonstrated that an optical biopsy needle guided by DRS has sufficient accuracy to differentiate HG from LG carcinoma and benign tissue. It may allow precise targeting of HG prostate cancer providing more accurate assessment of the disease and improvement in patient care.""","""['Priya N Werahera', 'Edward A Jasion', 'E David Crawford', 'M Scott Lucia', 'Adrie van Bokhoven', 'Holly T Sullivan', 'Fernando J Kim', 'Paul D Maroni', 'J David Port', 'John W Daily', 'Francisco G La Rosa']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Systematic diagnosis of prostate cancer using an optical biopsy needle adjunct with fluorescence spectroscopy.', 'Human feasibility study of fluorescence spectroscopy guided optical biopsy needle for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Analysis of histological findings obtained combining US/mp-MRI fusion-guided biopsies with systematic US biopsies: mp-MRI role in prostate cancer detection and false negative.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.']"""

Using a previously validated method for the analysis of nucleosides in blood serum by capillary electrophoresis with UV-vis spectroscopy detection, we investigated 60 samples from healthy individuals and 42 samples from prostate cancer patients. The concentrations of nucleosides in both groups were compared and a multivariate partial least squares-discriminant analysis classification model was optimized for prediction of prostate cancer. The validation of the model with an independent sample set resulted in the correct classification of 82.4% of the samples, with sensitivity of 90.5% and specificity of 76.7%.

Given this setting, the bladder presents the largest inter-fraction shape variations hampering the computation of the actual delivered dose vs. planned dose. This paper proposes a population model, based on longitudinal data, able to estimate the probability of bladder presence during treatment, using only the planning computed tomography (CT) scan as input information. As in previously-proposed principal component analysis (PCA) population-based models, we have used the data to obtain the dominant eigenmodes that describe bladder geometric variations between fractions. However, we have used a longitudinal analysis along each mode in order to properly characterize patient's variance from the total population variance. We have proposed is a mixed-effects (ME) model in order to separate intra- and inter-patient variability, in an effort to control confounding cohort effects. Other than using PCA, bladder shapes are represented by using spherical harmonics (SPHARM) that additionally enables data compression without information lost. Based on training data from repeated CT scans, the ME model was thus implemented following dimensionality reduction by means of SPHARM and PCA. We have evaluated the model in a leave-one-out cross validation framework on the training data but also using independent data. Probability maps (PMs) were thus generated with several draws from the learnt model as predicted regions where the bladder will likely move and deform. These PMs were compared with the actual regions using metrics based on mutual information distance and misestimated voxels. The prediction was also compared with two previous population PCA-based models. The proposed model was able to reduce the uncertainties in the estimation of the probable region of bladder motion and deformation. This model can thus be used for tailoring radiotherapy treatments.""","""['Richard Rios', 'Renaud De Crevoisier', 'Juan D Ospina', 'Frederic Commandeur', 'Caroline Lafond', 'Antoine Simon', 'Pascal Haigron', 'Jairo Espinosa', 'Oscar Acosta']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Modelling individual geometric variation based on dominant eigenmodes of organ deformation: implementation and evaluation.', 'Is Dose Deformation-Invariance Hypothesis Verified in Prostate IGRT?', 'Dosimetric treatment course simulation based on a statistical model of deformable organ motion.', 'Automatic bladder segmentation on CBCT for multiple plan ART of bladder cancer using a patient-specific bladder model.', 'An atlas-based electron density mapping method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-alone treatment planning and adaptive MRI-based prostate radiation therapy.', 'Planning With Patient-Specific Rectal Sub-Region Constraints Decreases Probability of Toxicity in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.']"""

A panel of 48 cytokines were measured and the significantly changed cytokine found in the discovery phase was validated using sera from a separate cohort of men two years after completing radiotherapy for prostate cancer at a different institution. Effects of the significantly changed cytokine on cell viability was quantified using the MTT assay. During the discovery phase, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TRAIL decoy receptor, TNFRSF10C (TRAIL-R3), were significantly upregulated in fatigued (≥3-point decrease from baseline to 1yr-post radiotherapy) subjects (n = 15). In the validation phase, TRAIL correlated with fatigue scores 2yrs post-radiotherapy. TRAIL caused selective cytotoxicity in neuronal cells, but not in microglial and muscle cells, in vitro.

Such comparisons are complicated due to the use of different questionnaires. We aimed to develop a method to convert scores among 4 commonly used instruments.  Materials and methods:   Patient reported data on urinary and sexual function were collected on 1,284 men with localized prostate cancer using the EPIC-26 (Expanded Prostate Index Composite), PCI (UCLA Prostate Cancer Index), SHIM (Sexual Health Inventory for Men) and I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Scale) questionnaires. We investigated several methods to convert scores among questionnaires.  Results:   Conversion between EPIC and PCI urinary and sexual function subscales was best achieved using only the subset of questions asked on both questionnaires. For the conversion between EPIC or PCI erectile function scores and SHIM scores, we defined thresholds of poor, intermediate and good function as EPIC/PCI 0 to 40 and SHIM 1 to 7, EPIC/PCI 41 to 59 and SHIM 8 to 16, and EPIC/PCI 60 to 100 and SHIM 17 to 25, respectively. Urinary continence scores highly correlated for PCI and EPIC (r = 0.94). No comparison was possible for I-PSS with EPIC and PCI due to differences in the domains addressed by these questionnaires.  Conclusions:   We have introduced methods to convert scores among the EPIC, PCI and SHIM questionnaires.

The method was applied to measure and correct for target motion during stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Patient: A patient with prostate adenocarcinoma undergoing SBRT with 36.25Gy, delivered in 5 fractions was enrolled in the study. 6DoF KIM technology: 2D positions of three implanted gold markers in each of the kV images (125kV, 10mA at 11Hz) were acquired continuously during treatment. The 2D→3D target position estimation was based on a probability distribution function. The 3D→6DoF target rotation was calculated using an iterative closest point algorithm. The accuracy and precision of the KIM method was measured by comparing the real-time results with kV-MV triangulation.  Results:   Of the five treatment fractions, KIM was utilised successfully in four fractions. The intrafraction prostate motion resulted in three couch shifts in two fractions when the prostate motion exceeded the pre-set action threshold of 2mm for more than 5s. KIM translational accuracy and precision were 0.3±0.6mm, -0.2±0.3mm and 0.2±0.7mm in the Left-Right (LR), Superior-Inferior (SI) and Anterior-Posterior (AP) directions, respectively. The KIM rotational accuracy and precision were 0.8°±2.0°, -0.5°±3.3° and 0.3°±1.6° in the roll, pitch and yaw directions, respectively.  Conclusion:   This treatment represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first time a cancer patient's tumour position and rotation have been monitored in real-time during treatment.

Material and methods:   5,199 men, aged 40-75y, underwent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and digital rectal examination (DRE). Men with a normal DRE and PSA ≥3ng/ml had a PCA3 test done. All men with PCA3 ≥35 underwent an initial biopsy (IBx) -12 cores-. Men with PCA3 <35 were randomized 1:1 to either IBx or observation. We compared them to those obtained with ERSPC RC-3.  Results:   PCA3 test was performed on 838 men (16.1%). In PCA3(+) and PCA3(-) groups, global PCa detection rates were 40.9% and 14.7% with a median follow-up (FU) of 21.7 months (P<.001). In the PCA3(+) arm (n=301, 35.9%), PCa was identified in 115 men at IBx (38.2%). In the randomized arm, 256 underwent IBx and PCa was found in 46 (18.0%) (P<.001). The biopsy-sparing potential would have been 64.1% as opposed to 76.6% if we had used ERSPC RC-3. However, the estimated false negative cases for HGPCa would have been reduced by 37.1% (89 to 56 patients). Moreover, if we had applied PCA3-35 to avoid IBx, 14.7% PCa and 9.1% of clinical significant PCa patients would not have been diagnosed during this FU.  Conclusions:   When PCA3-35 is used as a second-line biomarker when PSA ≥3ng/ml and DRE is normal, IBx could be avoided in 12.5% less than if ERSPC RC-3 is used and would reduce the false negative cases by 36.2%.

Interestingly, we have recently shown that treatment of cancer cells with verapamil causes an effect on autophagy. As autophagy is known to modulate chemotherapy responses, this prompted us to explore the impact of verapamil on autophagy and cell viability in greater detail. We report here that verapamil causes an induction of autophagic flux in a number or tumor cells and immortalized normal cells. Moreover, we found that inhibition of autophagy in COLO 205 cells, via treatment with the chloroquine (CQ) or by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of the autophagy genes Atg7 and Atg5, causes an upregulation of apoptotic markers in response to verapamil. In search of a mechanism for this effect and because autophagy can often mitigate metabolic stress, we examined the impact of verapamil on cellular metabolism. This revealed that in normal prostate cells, verapamil diminishes glucose and glycolytic intermediate levels leading to adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) depletion. In contrast, in COLO 205 cells it enhances aerobic glycolysis and maintains ATP. Importantly, we found that the autophagic response in these cells is related to the activity of l-lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA, EC 1.1.1.27), as inhibition of LDHA reduces both basal and verapamil-induced autophagy and consequently decreases cell viability. In summary, these findings not only identify a novel mechanism of cytoprotective autophagy induction but they also highlight the potential of using verapamil together with inhibitors of autophagy for the treatment of malignant disease.

In this study, we developed a fully automatic segmentation algorithm for T2-weighted endorectal prostate MRI and evaluated its accuracy within different regions of interest using a set of complementary error metrics. Our dataset contained 42 T2-weighted endorectal MRI from prostate cancer patients. The prostate was manually segmented by one observer on all of the images and by two other observers on a subset of 10 images. The algorithm first coarsely localizes the prostate in the image using a template matching technique. Then, it defines the prostate surface using learned shape and appearance information from a set of training images. To evaluate the algorithm, we assessed the error metric values in the context of measured inter-observer variability and compared performance to that of our previously published semi-automatic approach. The automatic algorithm needed an average execution time of ∼60 s to segment the prostate in 3D. When compared to a single-observer reference standard, the automatic algorithm has an average mean absolute distance of 2.8 mm, Dice similarity coefficient of 82%, recall of 82%, precision of 84%, and volume difference of 0.5 cm3 in the mid-gland. Concordant with other studies, accuracy was highest in the mid-gland and lower in the apex and base.

We also determined if the patient׳s treatment decision was influenced by the urologist׳s treatment preference.  Patients and methods:   Between August 2014 and July 2015, newly diagnosed patients with low-/intermediate-risk prostate cancer were offered to use a web-based DA after diagnosis. Treatment preferences and patient׳s values were extracted from the DA. Urologists׳ treatment preferences were indicated at the time of inclusion.  Results:   We included 181 patients, of whom 21% preferred active surveillance, 33% radical prostatectomy, 10% brachytherapy, 3% external beam radiotherapy, and 34% did not indicate a specific preferred treatment option after DA use (missing N = 6). Among 67%, treatment preference before DA use did not change after DA use. In men who chose active surveillance after DA use, 97% (37/38) preferred to postpone unnecessary treatment. For radical prostatectomy, 91% (52/57) of the patients valued tumor removal, and for brachytherapy, 88% (15/17) valued incontinence worse than bowel complaints. For 64% (missing N = 21) of the patients, urologists indicated one specific preferred treatment option as most suitable for the patient concerned. Agreement between final treatment decision and urologist׳s preference was lower (κ = 0.68) than between final treatment decision and preferred treatment after DA use (κ = 0.82).

Periodic increases in muscle protein synthesis (MPS) that occur after resistance exercise or protein intake may ameliorate this muscle loss, but the impact of these anabolic stimuli during ADT is unclear.  Objective:   To determine the acute MPS response to whey protein supplementation with and without resistance exercise during ADT.  Design:   Acute response in PCa patients vs age-matched controls (CON).  Setting:   Academic laboratory setting.  Participants:   PCa patients on ADT (N = 8) and CON (N = 10).  Intervention:   A standardized diet was consumed for 2 days prior to performing unilateral knee extension resistance exercise followed by ingestion of 40 g of whey protein.  Main outcome measures:   Bilateral biopsies and stable isotope infusions were used to determine MPS rates at rest after protein ingestion with and without resistance exercise.  Results:   Baseline MPS during ADT was suppressed relative to CON (P = 0.01). Protein consumption stimulated MPS in both groups (approximate twofold increase, both P < 0.001), but to a greater extent in CON (P = 0.003). Protein plus resistance exercise increased MPS (∼3.4-fold increase, both P < 0.001) to a greater extent than did protein alone (P < 0.001), but with no difference between groups (P = 0.380).  Conclusions:   ADT reduces basal and protein feeding-induced rises in MPS; however, combined protein ingestion with resistance exercise stimulated MPS to a similar degree as CON. Testosterone appears to play a role in maintaining muscle mass but is not necessary to initiate a robust response in MPS following resistance exercise when combined with protein ingestion.""","""['Erik D Hanson', 'André R Nelson', 'Daniel W D West', 'John A Violet', ""Lannie O'Keefe"", 'Stuart M Phillips', 'Alan Hayes']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['Native whey protein with high levels of leucine results in similar post-exercise muscular anabolic responses as regular whey protein: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Fish oil supplementation suppresses resistance exercise and feeding-induced increases in anabolic signaling without affecting myofibrillar protein synthesis in young men.', 'Whey protein but not collagen peptides stimulate acute and longer-term muscle protein synthesis with and without resistance exercise in healthy older women: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Dietary proteins and amino acids in the control of the muscle mass during immobilization and aging: role of the MPS response.', 'Physiologic and molecular bases of muscle hypertrophy and atrophy: impact of resistance exercise on human skeletal muscle (protein and exercise dose effects).', 'The Effect of Exercise and Nutritional Interventions on Body Composition in Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Does Androgen Deprivation for Prostate Cancer Affect Normal Adaptation to Resistance Exercise?', 'Exercise-Based Interventions to Counteract Skeletal Muscle Mass Loss in People with Cancer: Can We Overcome the Odds?', 'Fasting and Exercise in Oncology: Potential Synergism of Combined Interventions.', 'Effect of Periodized Resistance Training on Skeletal Muscle During Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: A Pilot Randomized Trial.']"""

By combining morphological features with quantitative information from the glands and stroma, logistic regression was used to discriminate regions with Gleason grade 3 versus grade 4 cancer in prostatectomy tissue. The overall accuracy of this classification derived from a receiver operating curve was 82%, which is in the range of human error when interobserver variability is considered.

Objective:   To determine the efficacy of abiraterone acetate with prednisone in these high-risk patients with a suboptimal response to hormonal induction.  Design, setting, and participants:   A phase 2 single-arm study was conducted through the National Clinical Trials Network-Southwest Oncology Group. Eligible patients had metastatic prostate cancer and a PSA level higher than 4.0 ng/mL between 6 and 12 months after starting ADT. The PSA level could be rising or falling at the time of enrollment, but had to be higher than 4.0 ng/mL. No previous chemotherapy or secondary hormonal therapies were allowed, except in patients receiving a standard, first-generation antiandrogen agent with a falling PSA level at the time of enrollment; this therapy was continued in this cohort. Abiraterone acetate, 1000 mg, once daily with prednisone, 5 mg, twice daily was administered to all participants. A total of 41 men were enrolled between the trial's activation on August 9, 2011, and closure on August 1, 2013. Data analysis was conducted from March 21 to November 29, 2016.  Interventions:   Abiraterone acetate, 1000 mg, once daily by mouth with prednisone, 5 mg, by mouth twice daily.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was a PSA level of 0.2 ng/mL or lower within 12 months of starting abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. A partial response (PR) was a secondary end point, defined as a PSA level reduction to lower than 4.0 ng/mL but higher than 0.2 ng/mL.  Results:   Of the 41 men enrolled, 1 did not receive any protocol treatment and was excluded from analysis. The median (range) age of the 40 participants was 66 (39-85) years. Five (13%) patients achieved a PSA level of 0.2 ng/mL or lower (95% CI, 4%-27%). Thirteen (33%) additional patients achieved a partial response, with a reduction in the PSA level to lower than 4.0 ng/mL but higher than 0.2 ng/mL. Sixteen (40%) patients had no PSA response and 6 (15%) were not assessable and assumed to be nonresponders. The median progression-free survival was 17.5 months (95% CI, 8.6-25.0 months) and the median overall survival was 25.8 months (95% CI, 15.7-25.8 months). There was 1 incident each of grade 4 adverse events of alanine aminotransferase level elevation and rectal hemorrhage. Eleven patients reported grade 3 adverse events.  Conclusions and relevance:   This study did not reach its prescribed level of 6 PSA responses of 0.2 ng/mL or lower, although 5 responses were observed.

Increased mtDNA copy number has been observed in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, suggesting a role in PCa development, but this association has not yet been investigated prospectively.  Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study (793 cases and 790 controls) of men randomized to the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) to evaluate the association between pre-diagnosis mtDNA copy number, measured in peripheral blood leukocytes, and the risk of PCa. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and polytomous logistic regression to analyze differences in associations by non-aggressive (Stage I/II AND Gleason grade < 8) or aggressive (Stage III/IV OR Gleason grade ≥ 8) PCa.  Results:   Although mtDNA copy number was not significantly associated with PCa risk overall (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.97-1.55, p = 0.089), increasing mtDNA copy number was associated with an increased risk of non-aggressive PCa (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.65, p = 0.044) compared to controls. No association was observed with aggressive PCa (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.64-1.63, p = 0.933). Higher mtDNA copy number was also associated with increased PSA levels among controls (p = 0.014).

These microenvironments represent dynamic systems that contribute to pathologic processes. Damage to DNA is a notable inducer of both transient and permanent alterations in cellular phenotypes. Induction of a DNA damage secretory program is known to promote adverse tumor cell behaviors such as proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and treatment resistance. However, prior studies designed to identify genotoxic stress-induced factors evaluated actively proliferating in vitro cultures of cells such as fibroblasts as experimental models. Conversely, the vast majority of benign cells in a typical tumor microenvironment (TME) are not proliferating but rather exist in quiescent (i.e., G0) or in terminally differentiated states. In this study, the diversity and magnitude of transcriptional responses to genotoxic damage in quiescent prostate fibroblasts were assessed using gene expression profiling. The secretory damage response in quiescent cells was highly concordant with that of actively dividing cells. Quiescent human prostate stroma exposed to genotoxic agents (e.g., mitoxantrone) in vivo resulted in significant upregulation (2.7- to 5.7-fold; P ≤ 0.01) of growth factors and cytokines including IL1β, MMP3, IL6, and IL8. The paracrine effects of damaged quiescent cells consistently increased the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells and promoted cell survival and resistance to apoptosis following exposure to chemotherapy.Implications: Benign quiescent cells in the TME respond to genotoxic stress by inducing a secretory program capable of promoting therapy resistance. Developing approaches to suppress the secretory program may improve treatment responses.

We compare patients' travel times for a range of imaging examinations performed across a large academic health system.  Materials and methods:   We searched the NYU Langone Medical Center Enterprise Data Warehouse to identify 442,990 adult outpatient imaging examinations performed over a recent 3.5-year period. Geocoding software was used to estimate typical driving times from patients' residences to imaging facilities. Variation in travel times was assessed among examination types.  Results:   The mean expected travel time was 29.2 ± 20.6 minutes, but this varied significantly (p < 0.001) among examination types. By modality, travel times were shortest for ultrasound (26.8 ± 18.9) and longest for positron emission tomography-computed tomography (31.9 ± 21.5). For magnetic resonance imaging, travel times were shortest for musculoskeletal extremity (26.4 ± 19.2) and spine (28.6 ± 21.0) examinations and longest for prostate (35.9 ± 25.6) and breast (32.4 ± 22.3) examinations. For computed tomography, travel times were shortest for a range of screening examinations [colonography (25.5 ± 20.8), coronary artery calcium scoring (26.1 ± 19.2), and lung cancer screening (26.4 ± 14.9)] and longest for angiography (32.0 ± 22.6). For ultrasound, travel times were shortest for aortic aneurysm screening (22.3 ± 18.4) and longest for breast (30.1 ± 19.2) examinations. Overall, men (29.9 ± 21.6) had longer (p < 0.001) travel times than women (27.8 ± 20.3); this difference persisted for each modality individually (p ≤ 0.006).

New emerging evidence indicates that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may play pivotal roles in the development of chemoresistance and metastasis. As a hallmark of EMT, E-cadherin is suggested to be a key marker in the development of chemoresistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PCa chemoresistance remain unclear. The current study aimed to explore the association between EMT and chemoresistance in PCa as well as whether changing the expression of E-cadherin would affect PCa chemoresistance.  Methods:   Parental PC3 and DU145 cells and their chemoresistant PC3-TxR and DU145-TxR cells were analyzed. PC3-TxR and DU145-TxR cells were transfected with E-cadherin-expressing lentivirus to overexpress E-cadherin; PC3 and DU145 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA to silence E-cadherin. Changes of EMT phenotype-related markers and signaling pathways were assessed by Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Tumor cell migration, invasion, and colony formation were then evaluated by wound healing, transwell, and colony formation assays, respectively. The drug sensitivity was evaluated using MTS assay.  Results:   Chemoresistant PC3-TxR and DU145-TxR cells exhibited an invasive and metastatic phenotype that associated with EMT, including the down-regulation of E-cadherin and up-regulation of Vimentin, Snail, and N-cadherin, comparing with that of parental PC3 and DU145 cells. When E-cadherin was overexpressed in PC3-TxR and DU145-TxR cells, the expression of Vimentin and Claudin-1 was down-regulated, and tumor cell migration and invasion were inhibited. In particular, the sensitivity to paclitaxel was reactivated in E-cadherin-overexpressing PC3-TxR and DU145-TxR cells. When E-cadherin expression was silenced in parental PC3 and DU145 cells, the expression of Vimentin and Snail was up-regulated, and, particularly, the sensitivity to paclitaxel was decreased. Interestingly, Notch-1 expression was up-regulated in PC3-TxR and DU145-TxR cells, whereas the E-cadherin expression was down-regulated in these cells comparing with their parental cells. The use of γ-secretase inhibitor, a Notch signaling pathway inhibitor, significantly increased the sensitivity of chemoresistant cells to paclitaxel.

Almost all of the potential benefits are associated with polyphenol content. Honey varieties from the arid region are reported to be rich in polyphenols, but data related to its bioactivity in vitro is greatly lacking. This study aimed at establishing the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of arid region honey. Four honey varieties from arid region (H1, H2, H3, and H4) and two popular non-arid region honey (H5 and H6) were tested in vitro in this study.  Methods:   The erythrocyte membrane protection effect of honey varieties were measured by hemolysis assay after exposing erythrocytes to a peroxide generator. The subsequent production of MDA (malondialdehyde) content in erythrocytes was measured. Immunomodulatory effect of the honey varieties was tested in prostate cancer cells PC-3 and PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) by measuring the IL-6 (interleukin 6) and NO (nitric oxide) levels in cell culture supernatant after incubation with the honey varieties. PC-3 cell viability was assessed after incubation with honey varieties for 24 h.  Results:   Arid region honey exhibited superior erythrocyte membrane protection effect with H4 measuring 1.3 ± 0.042mMTE/g and H2 measuring 1.122 ± 0.018mMTE/g. MDA levels were significantly reduced by honey samples, especially H4 (20.819 ± 0.63 nmol/mg protein). We observed a significant decrease in cell population in PC-3 after 24 h in culture on treatment with honey. A moderate increase in NO levels was observed in both cultures after 24 h at the same time levels of IL-6 were remarkably reduced by honey varieties.  Conclusion:   The results demonstrate the antioxidant effect of arid region honey due to its erythrocyte membrane protection effect and subsequent lowering of oxidative damage as evident from lower levels of lipid peroxidation byproduct MDA. Arid region honey varieties were as good as non-arid region types at decreasing cell viability of prostate cancer cells. The moderate increase in NO levels in PC-3 and PBMCs were not significant enough to elicit any pro-inflammatory response. However, IL-6 secretion was remarkably reduced by all honey varieties in a comparable level indicating the potential anti-inflammatory property of arid region honey.""","""['Serene Hilary', 'Hosam Habib', 'Usama Souka', 'Wissam Ibrahim', 'Carine Platat']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Complement Altern Med""","""['Assessment of membrane stabilizing activity from honey.

While irreversible phenotypic switching can be detected by studying the genome, reversible phenotypic switching is often difficult to examine due to its dynamic nature and the lack of knowledge about its contributing factors. In this study, we demonstrate that culturing cells in different physical environments, stiff, soft, or suspension, induced a phenotypic switch in prostate cancer cells via mechanotransduction. The mechanosensitive phenotypic switching in prostate cancer cells was sustainable yet reversible even after long-term culture, demonstrating the impact of mechanical signals on prostate cancer cell phenotypes. Importantly, such a mechanotransduction-mediated phenotypic switch in prostate cancer cells was accompanied by decreased sensitivity of the cells to paclitaxel, suggesting a role of mechanotransduction in the evolution of drug resistance. Multiple signaling pathways such as p38MAPK, ERK, and Wnt were found to be involved in the mechanotransduction-induced phenotypic switching of prostate cancer cells. Given that cancer cells experience different physical environments during disease progression, this study provides useful information about the important role of mechanotransduction in cancer, and how circulating tumor cells may be capable of continuously changing their phenotypes throughout the disease process.""","""['Koh Meng Aw Yong', 'Yubing Sun', 'Sofia D Merajver', 'Jianping Fu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biophys J""","""['Quercetin modulates Wnt signaling components in prostate cancer cell line by inhibiting cell viability, migration, and metastases.', 'Roles of the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathways in malignant transformation and drug resistance.', 'Phenotypic plasticity in prostate cancer: role of intrinsically disordered proteins.', 'Targeting ribosomal S6 kinases/Y-box binding protein-1 signaling improves cellular sensitivity to taxane in prostate cancer.', 'Disorder, Promiscuous Interactions, and Stochasticity Regulate State Switching in the Unstable Prostate.', 'Phenotypic pliancy and the breakdown of epigenetic polycomb mechanisms.', 'Prostate cancer cells of increasing metastatic potential exhibit diverse contractile forces, cell stiffness, and motility in a microenvironment stiffness-dependent manner.', 'The Extracellular Matrix Stiffening: A Trigger of Prostate Cancer Progression and Castration Resistance?', 'Piezo channels in the urinary system.', 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.']"""

Patients and Methods This single-institution, randomized clinical trial, conducted from January 2003 to December 2007, enrolled 168 patients with high-risk PCa who were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to conventional (80 Gy in 40 fractions in 8 weeks) or hypofractionated radiotherapy (62 Gy in 20 fractions in 5 weeks) to prostate and seminal vesicles. The primary outcome measure was late toxicity. Additional outcomes were freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCaSS), and overall survival (OS), evaluated on an intention-to-treat basis. Results A total of 85 patients were assigned to conventional and 83 to hypofractionated radiotherapy. At a median follow-up of 9 years (interquartile range, 7.5 to 10.1 years), no differences was observed in physician-assessed late gastro intestinal and genitourinary toxicity greater than or equal to grade 2 ( P = .68 and .57, respectively) were found between the two arms. The 10-year FFBF rate was 72% in the hypofractionation group and 65% in the conventional fractionation group ( P = .148). Ten-year OS rates were 75% in the hypofractionation group and 64% in the conventional group, respectively ( P = .22). The same features for 10-year PCaSS were 95% and 88%, respectively ( P = .066). Hypofractionation, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, and clinical tumor stage for FFBF, and hypofractionation and Gleason score for PCaSS were significant prognostic variables on the multivariate analysis. Conclusion Long-term findings showed that hypofractionated radiotherapy failed the intent of either reducing physician-assessed late toxicity or maintaining the same efficacy. A postrandomization analysis, however, revealed that hypofractionation was a significant prognostic factor for FFBF and PCaSS, when adjusted for clinical prognostic variables.""","""['Giorgio Arcangeli', 'Biancamaria Saracino', 'Stefano Arcangeli', 'Sara Gomellini', 'Maria Grazia Petrongari', 'Giuseppe Sanguineti', 'Lidia Strigari']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Further Evidence to Tip the Scales.', 'Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the HYPO-RT-PC randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer (HYPRO): late toxicity results from a randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer (HYPRO): acute toxicity results from a randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial.', 'A systematic review of hypofractionation for primary management of prostate cancer.', 'Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Challenging Accelerated Hypofractionated Radiotherapy.', 'Radiobiological Meta-Analysis of the Response of Prostate Cancer to Different Fractionations: Evaluation of the Linear-Quadratic Response at Large Doses and the Effect of Risk and ADT.', 'Expanding radiotherapy access in Sub-Saharan Africa: an analysis of travel burdens and patient-related benefits of hypofractionation.', 'Moderately Hypofractionated Helical Tomotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Ten-year Experience of a Mono-institutional Series of 415 Patients.', 'Radiation technique and outcomes following moderately hypofractionated treatment of low risk prostate cancer: a secondary analysis of RTOG 0415.', 'Hyaluronic Acid Spacer for Hypofractionated Prostate Radiation Therapy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.']"""

Unfortunately, none of these therapies is curative and patients are destined to develop a resistant phenotype.Progression to ADT leads to the attainment of a castration resistant disease whose mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Reactivation of AR has been shown to occur and second-generation of AR targeting drugs are usually prescribed. Upon progression to these agents AR signaling still remains the primary driver although it often becomes ligand independent, since it can be either restored through mutations on the ligand binding domain and/or formation of AR splicing variants or by passed through a cross talk with other oncogenic signaling pathways.AR-independent signaling pathways may represent additional mechanisms underlying castration resistant progression.

To compare symptom clusters with scales, and to explore their value in PROMs interpretation and symptom management.  Methods:   A dataset called RT01 (ISCRTN47772397) of 843 prostate cancer patients was used. PROMs were reported with the University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI). Symptom clusters were explored with hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and average linkage method (correlation > 0.6). The reliability of the Urinary Function Scale was evaluated with Cronbach's Alpha. The strength of the relationship between the items was investigated with Spearman's correlation. Predictive accuracy of the clusters was compared to the scales by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Presence of urinary symptoms at 3 years measured with the late effects on normal tissue: subjective, objective, management tool (LENT/SOM) was an endpoint.  Results:   Two symptom clusters were identified (urinary cluster and sexual cluster). The grouping of symptom clusters was different than UCLA-PCI Scales. Two items of the urinary function scales (""number of pads"" and ""urinary leak interfering with sex"") were excluded from the urinary cluster. The correlation with the other items in the scale ranged from 0.20 to 0.21 and 0.31 to 0.39, respectively. Cronbach's Alpha showed low correlation of those items with the Urinary Function Scale (0.14-0.36 and 0.33-0.44, respectively). All urinary function scale items were subject to a ceiling effect. Clusters had better predictive accuracy, AUC = 0.70 -0.65, while scales AUC = 0.67-0.61.

Herein, we devise an in-situ signal-amplification strategy for enhanced electrical readout of potentiometric immunosensor toward target prostate-specific antigen (PSA, one kind of cancer biomarkers), based on polyion oligonucleotide-labeled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). To decrease the background signal, monoclonal anti-human PSA capture antibody was covalently conjugated onto an activated glassy carbon electrode via typical carbodiimide coupling. AuNPs heavily functionalized with the polyion oligonucleotides and polyclonal anti-PSA detection antibodies (pAb2-AuNP-DNA) were utilized as the signal-generation nanotags. In the presence of target PSA, a sandwich-type immunoreaction was executed between capture antibody and detection antibody on the electrode. The detectable signal derived from the shift in the electric potential as a result of the change in the surface charge before and after the antigen-antibody reaction. With target PSA increased, the captured pAb2-AuNP-DNA to the electrode accompanying detection antibody increased, thereby resulting in the change of the electrode potential. Due to numerous polyion oligonucleotides with the negative charge, the signal readout amplified. Under the optimal conditions, the shift in the output potential was proportional to the logarithm of target PSA concentration and displayed a dynamic linear range from 0.05 to 20 ng mL-1 with a detection limit of 13.6 pg mL-1. An intermediate precision of ≤13.2% was accomplished with the batch-to-batch identification. The selectivity was acceptable. The method accuracy was evaluated for human serum specimens, and gave the consistent results between the potentiometric immunosensor and the referenced enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).""","""['Shuzhen Lv', 'Zhenzhen Lin', 'Kangyao Zhang', 'Minghua Lu', 'Dianping Tang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['Bio-bar-code-based photoelectrochemical immunoassay for sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen using rolling circle amplification and enzymatic biocatalytic precipitation.', 'Ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for PSA biomarker detection in prostate cancer cells using gold nanoparticles/PAMAM dendrimer loaded with enzyme linked aptamer as integrated triple signal amplification strategy.', 'Competitive-type displacement reaction for direct potentiometric detection of low-abundance protein.', 'Electrochemical Immunosensors Based on Nanostructured Materials for Sensing of Prostate-Specific Antigen: A Review.', 'Current Technologies of Electrochemical Immunosensors: Perspective on Signal Amplification.', 'Wearable and flexible electrochemical sensors for sweat analysis: a review.', '4-Nitrophenol-Loaded Magnetic Mesoporous Silica Hybrid Materials for Spectrometric Aptasensing of Carcinoembryonic Antigen.']"""

The recent demonstration that far from being benign, ""benign"" prostatic hypertrophy is a likely a reaction of the prostate to chronic untreated lower genital tract infection, and that this chronic inflammation is likely the usual precursor to the frequent occurrence of prostatic carcinoma has far reaching implications. The obvious source for the chronic inflammatory stimulus in the prostate is the documented dramatically altered lower female genital microbiota associated with the menopause. Hence the major hypothesis is that prostatic cancer may arise due to chronic infection and inflammation in the prostate gland consequent upon the altered microbiome of the menopausal female genital tract. This has implications for testing and diagnosis, treatment, population health and personal hygiene practices. It suggests that male dyspareunia, although almost never encountered in clinical practice may in fact be relatively common in older males, and in particular if diagnosed, represents a critical opportunity for therapeutic intervention to interrupt the chronic inflammation - cancer transformation and progression which has been well documented in other tissues. It implies that the coordinated application of next generation sequencing to the microbiome of the lower genital tracts of male and female couples, including seminal fluid, will have both research applications to further explore this sequence, as well as finding application as a potential population level screening procedure as is presently done for the ""Thin Prep"" cervical screening for human papillomavirus in females. Moreover this insight opens up new opportunities for chemointervention and chemoprevention for this important clinicopathological progression. These considerations give rise to the exciting possibility that prostatic malignancy may be preventable by various methods of local hygiene in the female partner or some antibacterial method in males.

The expression of SOD3 is regulated by epigenetics in human lung cancer A549 cells and human monocytic THP-1 cells; however, the molecular mechanisms governing SOD3 expression have not been elucidated in detail. Ten-eleven translocation (TET), a dioxygenase of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), plays a central role in DNA demethylation processes and induces target gene expression. In the present study, TET1 expression was abundant in U937 cells, but its expression was weakly expressed in A549 and THP-1 cells. These results are consistent with the expression pattern of SOD3 and its DNA methylation status in these cells. Moreover, above relationship was also observed in human breast cancer cells, human prostate cancer cells, and human skin fibroblasts. The overexpression of TET1-catalytic domain (TET1-CD) induced the expression of SOD3 in A549 cells, and this was accompanied by the direct binding of TET1-CD to the SOD3 promoter region.

Prostate Imaging Compared to Transperineal Ultrasound-guided biopsy for significant prostate cancer Risk Evaluation (PICTURE) was a paired-cohort confirmatory study designed to assess diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in men requiring a repeat biopsy.  Methods:   All underwent 3 T mpMRI and transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies (TTPM biopsies). Multiparametric MRI was reported using Likert scores and radiologists were blinded to initial biopsies. Men were blinded to mpMRI results. Clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as Gleason ⩾4+3 and/or cancer core length ⩾6 mm.  Results:   Two hundred and forty-nine had both tests with mean (s.d.) age was 62 (7) years, median (IQR) PSA 6.8 ng ml (4.98-9.50), median (IQR) number of previous biopsies 1 (1-2) and mean (s.d.) gland size 37 ml (15.5). On TTPM biopsies, 103 (41%) had clinically significant prostate cancer. Two hundred and fourteen (86%) had a positive prostate mpMRI using Likert score ⩾3; sensitivity was 97.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 92-99), specificity 21.9% (15.5-29.5), negative predictive value (NPV) 91.4% (76.9-98.1) and positive predictive value (PPV) 46.7% (35.2-47.8). One hundred and twenty-nine (51.8%) had a positive mpMRI using Likert score ⩾4; sensitivity was 80.6% (71.6-87.7), specificity 68.5% (60.3-75.9), NPV 83.3% (75.4-89.5) and PPV 64.3% (55.4-72.6).  Conclusions:   In men advised to have a repeat prostate biopsy, prostate mpMRI could be used to safely avoid a repeat biopsy with high sensitivity for clinically significant cancers.

We aimed to develop and internally validate a risk-stratification tool incorporating the Decipher score, along with routinely available clinicopathologic features, to identify patients who would benefit the most from aRT. Patient and Methods Our cohort included 512 patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy at one of four US academic centers between 1990 and 2010. All patients had ≥ pT3a disease, positive surgical margins, and/or pathologic lymph node invasion. Multivariable Cox regression analysis tested the relationship between available predictors (including Decipher score) and clinical recurrence (CR), which were then used to develop a novel risk-stratification tool. Our study adhered to the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis guidelines for development of prognostic models. Results Overall, 21.9% of patients received aRT. Median follow-up in censored patients was 8.3 years. The 10-year CR rate was 4.9% vs. 17.4% in patients treated with aRT versus initial observation ( P < .001). Pathologic T3b/T4 stage, Gleason score 8-10, lymph node invasion, and Decipher score > 0.6 were independent predictors of CR (all P < .01). The cumulative number of risk factors was 0, 1, 2, and 3 to 4 in 46.5%, 28.9%, 17.2%, and 7.4% of patients, respectively. aRT was associated with decreased CR rate in patients with two or more risk factors (10-year CR rate 10.1% in aRT v 42.1% in initial observation; P = .012), but not in those with fewer than two risk factors ( P = .18). Conclusion Using the new model to indicate aRT might reduce overtreatment, decrease unnecessary adverse effects, and reduce risk of CR in the subset of patients (approximately 25% of all patients with aggressive pathologic disease in our cohort) who benefit from this therapy.""","""['Deepansh Dalela', 'María Santiago-Jiménez', 'Kasra Yousefi', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Robert B Den', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Adam P Dicker', 'Mani Menon', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Firas Abdollah']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Can Genomic Data Guide the Postoperative Management of Prostate Cancer?', 'Postoperative radiation therapy for prostate cancer : Still no genomic risk profiling for clinical routine.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Predicting survival of patients with node-positive prostate cancer following multimodal treatment.', 'Risk stratification of patients with extraprostatic extension and negative lymph nodes at radical prostatectomy: identifying optimal candidates for adjuvant therapy.', 'Individual Patient-Level Meta-Analysis of the Performance of the Decipher Genomic Classifier in High-Risk Men After Prostatectomy to Predict Development of Metastatic Disease.', 'Incorporating Prognostic Biomarkers into Risk Assessment Models and TNM Staging for Prostate Cancer.', 'SGK2 promotes prostate cancer metastasis by inhibiting ferroptosis via upregulating GPX4.', 'Adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with node-positive prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of Decipher on use of post-operative radiotherapy: Individual patient analysis of two prospective registries.', 'The Role and Significance of Bioumoral Markers in Prostate Cancer.', 'Nomogram predict relapse-free survival of patients with thymic epithelial tumors after surgery.']"""

In this study, we investigated the role of miR-455-3p in prostate cancer. We found that miR-455-3p is markedly downregulated in prostate cancer cell lines and clinical tumor specimens. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that miR-455-3p promotes prostate cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis and Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-455-3p directly targets and suppresses eIF4E, the rate-limiting factor for cap-dependent translation, which plays important roles in the initiation and progression of prostate cancers. Further studies demonstrated that miR-455-3p inhibits cap-dependent translation and the proliferation of prostate cancer cells through targeting eIF4E.

However, obese men have larger prostates which may lower biopsy accuracy and cause a systematic bias toward the null in epidemiologic studies of over-all risk.  Methods:   Within a cohort of 6692 men followed-up after a biopsy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) with benign findings, a nested case-control study was conducted of 495 prostate cancer cases and controls matched on age, race, follow-up duration, biopsy versus TURP, and procedure date. Data on body mass index and prostate volume at the time of the initial procedure were abstracted from medical records.  Results:   Prior to consideration of differences in prostate volume, overweight (OR = 1.41; 95%CI 1.01, 1.97), and obese status (OR = 1.59; 95%CI 1.09, 2.33) at the time of the original benign biopsy or TURP were associated with PCa incidence during follow-up. Prostate volume did not significantly moderate the association between body-size and PCa, however it did act as an inverse confounder; adjustment for prostate volume increased the effect size for overweight by 22% (adjusted OR = 1.52; 95%CI 1.08, 2.14) and for obese status by 23% (adjusted OR = 1.77; 95%CI 1.20, 2.62). Larger prostate volume at the time of the original benign biopsy or TURP was inversely associated with PCa incidence during follow-up (OR = 0.92 per 10 cc difference in volume; 95%CI 0.88, 0.97). In analyses that stratified case-control pairs by tumor aggressiveness of the case, prostate volume acted as an inverse confounder in analyses of non-aggressive PCa but not in analyses of aggressive PCa.  Conclusions:   In studies of obesity and PCa, differences in prostate volume cause a bias toward the null, particularly in analyses of non-aggressive PCa.

Methods:   For the first time, we demonstrate that by applying domain adaptation and transfer learning methods, a tissue classification model trained on TeUS RF data (source domain) can be deployed for classification using TeUS B-mode data alone (target domain), where both data are obtained on the same ultrasound scanner. This is a critical step for clinical translation of tissue classification techniques that primarily rely on accessing RF data, since this imaging modality is not readily available on all commercial scanners in clinics. Proof of concept is provided for in vivo characterization of PCa using TeUS B-mode data, where different nonlinear processing filters in the pipeline of the RF to B-mode conversion result in a distribution shift between the two domains.  Results:   Our in vivo study includes data obtained in MRI-guided targeted procedure for prostate biopsy.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression. Incorrect expression or mutation of lncRNAs has been reported to be associated with several disease conditions, such a malignant transformation in humans. Importantly, pivotal players in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, such as c-Myc, may be regulated by lncRNA at promoter level. The function of lncRNA can be reduced with antisense oligonucleotides that sequester or degrade mature lncRNAs. In alternative, lncRNA transcription can be blocked by small interference RNA (RNAi), which had acquired, recently, broad interested in clinical applications. In vivo-jetPEI™ is a linear polyethylenimine mediating nucleic acid (DNA, shRNA, siRNA, oligonucelotides) delivery with high efficiency. Different in vivo delivery routes have been validated: intravenous (IV), intraperitoneal (IP), intratumoral, subcutaneous, topical, and intrathecal. High levels of nucleic acid delivery are achieved into a broad range of tissues, such as lung, salivary glands, heart, spleen, liver, and prostate upon systemic administration. In addition, in vivo-jetPEI™ is also an efficient carrier for local gene and siRNA delivery such as intratumoral or topical application on the skin. After systemic injection, siRNA can be detected and the levels can be validated in target tissues by qRT-PCR.

Whereas the localized disease is highly treatable by surgical resection and radiation, cancer that has metastasized remains incurable. Immune cells that primarily scavenge debris and promote prostate cancer angiogenesis and wound repair are M2 macrophages. They are phenotypically similar to M2 tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) and have been reported to associate with solid tumors and aide in proliferation, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. As an invasive species within the tumor microenvironment, this makes M2-TAMs an ideal therapeutic target in prostate cancer. To identify novel surface glycoproteins expressed on M2 macrophages, we developed a novel method of creating homogeneous populations of human macrophages from human CD14+ monocytes in vitro These homogeneous M1 macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, and our M2 macrophages secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To identify enriched surface glycoproteins, we then performed solid-phase extraction of N-linked glycopeptides followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on our homogeneous macrophage populations. We discovered five novel peptides that are enriched exclusively on human M2 macrophages relative to human M1 macrophages and human CD14+ monocytes. Finally, we determined whether these surface glycoproteins, found enriched on M2 macrophages, were also expressed in human metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) tissues. Using mCRPC tissues from rapid autopsies, we were able to determine M2 macrophage infiltration by using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. These findings highlight the presence of macrophage infiltration in human mCRPC but also surface glycoproteins that could be used for prognosis of localized disease and for targeting strategies.""","""['Jelani C Zarif', 'Weiming Yang', 'James R Hernandez', 'Hui Zhang', 'Kenneth J Pienta']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Cell Proteomics""","""['Mannose Receptor-positive Macrophage Infiltration Correlates with Prostate Cancer Onset and Metastatic Castration-resistant Disease.', 'Effect of dietary omega-3 fatty acids on castrate-resistant prostate cancer and tumor-associated macrophages.', 'Human breast cancer cells educate macrophages toward the M2 activation status.', 'A Review of Preclinical Experiments Toward Targeting M2 Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.', 'Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Ovarian Cancer: Implications for Therapy.', 'Application of StrucGP in medical immunology: site-specific N-glycoproteomic analysis of macrophages.', 'Mast cell surfaceome characterization reveals CD98 heavy chain is critical for optimal cell function.', 'Mass Spectrometry-Based Glycoproteomics and Prostate Cancer.', 'A Pragmatic Guide to Enrichment Strategies for Mass Spectrometry-Based Glycoproteomics.', 'Resident and elicited murine macrophages differ in expression of their glycomes and glycan-binding proteins.']"""

Univariate and multivariate Cox-proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to evaluate significant variables associated with CSS and OS.  Results:   UTUC with VH was present in 41 (9.1%) patients. UTUC with VH showed aggressive clinicopathological features in comparison with pure UTUC. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed significantly decreased 5-year CSS and OS (both, P<0.001) in UTUC with VH group. Multivariate analysis revealed that VH was an independent predictor of CSS (P<0.001) and OS (P<0.002). The Kaplan-Meier curves also showed significantly decreased 5-year CSS and OS in UTUC with the VH group compared to the pure UTUC group in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy.  Conclusions:   We found that UTUC with VH harbored aggressive biologic features, and VH was an independent prognostic factor for CSS and OS on both univariate and multivariate analyses.

Despite national screening programs combined with new treatments relapse rate remain high and new therapies are needed. From previous work, we identified PACE4, a member of the proprotein convertase (PCs) family of endoproteases, as a novel therapeutic target in prostate cancer. In the present study we asked the question if PACE4 could also be a potential target in breast cancer. In clinical samples of breast adenocarcinoma, we observed a specific overexpression of PACE4 in the estrogen-receptor (ER) positive subtype. We therefore looked for a breast cancer cell line model which would be representative and thus focused on the ZR-75-1 since it both expresses PACE4 and is estrogen-receptor positive. We compared stable knockdowns of furin, PACE4 and PC7 in the estrogen-receptor-positive cell line ZR-75-1 to evaluate their respective contribution to cell growth and tumor progression. PACE4 was the only PC displaying an impact on cell growth. A PACE4 peptide-based inhibitor (C23) was tested and shown to decrease proliferation of ZR-75-1 cells in cell based assays.

Current evidence supports the beneficial effects of physical exercise in reducing fatigue, but the results across studies are not consistent, especially in terms of exercise intensity. It is also unclear whether use of behaviour change techniques can further increase exercise adherence and maintain physical activity behaviour. This study will investigate whether exercise intensity affects fatigue and health related quality of life in persons undergoing adjuvant cancer treatment. In addition, to examine effects of exercise intensity on mood disturbance, adherence to oncological treatment, adverse effects from treatment, activities of daily living after treatment completion and return to work, and behaviour change techniques effect on exercise adherence. We will also investigate whether exercise intensity influences inflammatory markers and cytokines, and whether gene expressions following training serve as mediators for the effects of exercise on fatigue and health related quality of life.  Methods/design:   Six hundred newly diagnosed persons with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer undergoing adjuvant therapy will be randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial design to following conditions; A) individually tailored low-to-moderate intensity exercise with or without behaviour change techniques or B) individually tailored high intensity exercise with or without behaviour change techniques. The training consists of both resistance and endurance exercise sessions under the guidance of trained coaches. The primary outcomes, fatigue and health related quality of life, are measured by self-reports. Secondary outcomes include fitness, mood disturbance, adherence to the cancer treatment, adverse effects, return to activities of daily living after completed treatment, return to work as well as inflammatory markers, cytokines and gene expression.  Discussion:   The study will contribute to our understanding of the value of exercise and exercise intensity in reducing fatigue and improving health related quality of life and, potentially, clinical outcomes. The value of behaviour change techniques in terms of adherence to and maintenance of physical exercise behaviour in persons with cancer will be evaluated.

The TOP algorithm automates core planning for systematic prostate biopsies using the 3-dimensional organ contour and an alterable volume for tumors to be excluded.  Subjects and methods:   MRI-transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy with MRI-targeted biopsies (TBs) and systematic-TOP biopsies were performed on 172 men between October 2013 and March 2014. Systematic biopsies were placed according to TOP for detection of tumor volumes >0.5 mL with a minimum of 80% organ coverage in prostates up to 50 mL (70% in larger organs).  Results:   Median 24 TOP cores and 3 MRI-TBs have been placed. Prostate cancer (PCa) was detected in 112 of 172 (65%) of men; TOP detected 109 (97%) and TB 62 (55%). Significant cancer (Gleason score ≥7) was detected in 75 (44%) of men and of these TOP detected 73 of 75 (97%) and TB 51 of 75 (68%). Overall, systematic-TOP sampling significantly outperformed TB for the detection of both, all PCa as well as significant PCa (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0005).

By interacting with and co-activating the androgen receptor, the KDM4 subfamily (KDM4A-E) promotes aggressive phenotypes of prostate cancer (PCa). Knockdown of KDM4 expression or inhibition of KDM4 enzyme activity reduces the proliferation of PCa cell lines and highlights inhibition of lysine demethylation as a possible therapeutic method for PCa treatment. To address this possibility, we screened the ChemBioNet small molecule library for inhibitors of the human KDM4E isoform and identified several compounds with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. Two hits, validated as active by an orthogonal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, displayed moderate selectivity toward the KDM4 subfamily and exhibited antiproliferative effects in cellular models of PCa. These compounds were further characterized by their ability to maintain the transcriptionally silent histone H3 tri-methyl K9 epigenetic mark at subcytotoxic concentrations.

Patients and Methods We identified men managed with AS at our institution with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. The primary study objective was to examine the association of age with risk of biopsy-based Gleason score upgrade during AS. We also examined the association of age with related end points, including overall biopsy-determined progression, definitive treatment, and pathologic and biochemical outcomes after delayed radical prostatectomy (RP), using descriptive statistics, the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Results A total of 1,433 patients were followed for a median of 49 months; 74% underwent initial biopsy at a referring institution. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years, including 599 patients (42%) ≤ 60 years old and 834 (58%) > 60 years old. The 3- and 5-year biopsy-based Gleason score upgrade-free rates were 73% and 55%, respectively, for men ≤ 60 years old compared with 64% and 48%, respectively, for men older than 60 years ( P < .01). On Cox regression analysis, younger age was independently associated with lower risk of biopsy-based Gleason score upgrade (hazard ratio per 1-year decrease, 0.969 [95% CI, 0.956 to 0.983]; P < .01), and persisted upon restriction to men meeting strict AS inclusion criteria. There was no significant association between younger age and risk of definitive treatment or risk of biochemical recurrence after delayed RP. Conclusion Younger patient age was associated with decreased risk of biopsy-based Gleason score upgrade during AS but not with risk of definitive treatment in the intermediate term. AS represents a strategy to mitigate overtreatment in young patients with low-risk PCa in the early term.""","""['Michael S Leapman', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Hao G Nguyen', 'Katsuto K Shinohara', 'Nannette Perez', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'William J Catalona', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Is Low-Risk Prostate Cancer More Indolent in Younger Patients?', 'Re: Active Surveillance in Younger Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Re: Active Surveillance in Younger Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'New Prostate Cancer Grading System Predicts Long-term Survival Following Surgery for Gleason Score 8-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Obesity is associated with risk of progression for low-risk prostate cancers managed expectantly.', 'Prognostic utility of biopsy-derived cell cycle progression score in patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-risk prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy: implications for treatment guidance.', 'Untreated Gleason Grade Progression on Serial Biopsies during Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance: Clinical Course and Pathological Outcomes.', 'Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Current Data.', 'The impact of age on prostate cancer progression and quality of life in active surveillance patients.', 'Serial prostate magnetic resonance imaging fails to predict pathological progression in patients on active surveillance.', 'When to Discuss Prostate Cancer Screening With Average-Risk Men.', 'How should radiologists incorporate non-imaging prostate cancer biomarkers into daily practice?']"""

Compared to other levels, social effects that occur geospatially in neighborhoods are not as well-studied, and empiric methods to assess these effects are limited. We propose a novel Neighborhood-Wide Association Study(NWAS), analogous to genome-wide association studies(GWAS), that utilizes high-dimensional computing approaches from biology to comprehensively and empirically identify neighborhood factors associated with disease.  Methods:   Pennsylvania Cancer Registry data were linked to U.S. Census data. In a successively more stringent multiphase approach, we evaluated the association between neighborhood (n = 14,663 census variables) and prostate cancer aggressiveness(PCA) with n = 6,416 aggressive (Stage≥3/Gleason grade≥7 cases) vs. n = 70,670 non-aggressive (Stage<3/Gleason grade<7) cases in White men. Analyses accounted for age, year of diagnosis, spatial correlation, and multiple-testing. We used generalized estimating equations in Phase 1 and Bayesian mixed effects models in Phase 2 to calculate odds ratios(OR) and confidence/credible intervals(CI). In Phase 3, principal components analysis grouped correlated variables.  Results:   We identified 17 new neighborhood variables associated with PCA. These variables represented income, housing, employment, immigration, access to care, and social support. The top hits or most significant variables related to transportation (OR = 1.05;CI = 1.001-1.09) and poverty (OR = 1.07;CI = 1.01-1.12).  Conclusions:   This study introduces the application of high-dimensional, computational methods to large-scale, publically-available geospatial data. Although NWAS requires further testing, it is hypothesis-generating and addresses gaps in geospatial analysis related to empiric assessment.

Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the regional ethics committee. Between July 2013 and March 2015, 63 patients from a prospectively accrued study population who underwent MR imaging of the prostate including transverse T1-weighted; transverse, coronal, and sagittal T2-weighted; diffusion-weighted; and dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging with a 3-T imager at a single institution were included in this retrospective study. The short MR imaging protocol image set consisted of transverse T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images only. The standard MR imaging protocol image set contained images from all six pulse sequences. Three expert readers from different institutions assessed the likelihood of prostate cancer on a five-point scale. Diagnostic performance on a quadrant basis was assessed by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves, and differences were evaluated by using 83.8% confidence intervals. Intra- and interreader agreement was assessed by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Transperineal template saturation biopsy served as the standard of reference. Results At histopathologic evaluation, 84 of 252 (33%) quadrants were positive for cancer in 38 of 63 (60%) men. There was no significant difference in detection of tumors larger than or equal to 0.5 mL for any of the readers of the short MR imaging protocol, with areas under the curve in the range of 0.74-0.81 (83.8% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64, 0.89), and for readers of the standard MR imaging protocol, areas under the curve were 0.71-0.77 (83.8% CI: 0.62, 0.86). Ranges for sensitivity were 0.76-0.95 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.99) and 0.76-0.86 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.97) and those for specificity were 0.84-0.90 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.94) and 0.82-0.90 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.94) for the short and standard MR protocols, respectively.

However, the mechanism of downregulation of inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II in prostate cancer development has not yet been fully clarified. In this study, microRNA-590-3p was found to be upregulated in both prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of microRNA-590-3p by microRNA-590-3p mimics promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion and accelerated the growth of xenografted tumors, while microRNA-590-3p inhibitors contributed to inhibition of cellular proliferation and invasion as well as tumor growth. A dual-luciferase reporter assay and expression analysis further confirmed that inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II was a direct target of microRNA-590-3p. Enforced expression of microRNA-590-3p led to repression of inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II messenger RNA and protein expression, as well as upregulation of p-Akt, p-FoxO3a, and cyclin D1 and downregulation of p21 expression in prostate cancer cell lines. Overexpression of inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II could reduce microRNA-590-3p-induced cell proliferation and invasion as well as tumor growth, and decrease microRNA-590-3p-mediated upregulation of cyclin D1 and downregulation of p21 expression in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our findings reveal that microRNA-590-3p is a potential onco-microRNA that participates in carcinogenesis of human prostate cancer by suppressing inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II expression and involving the Akt/FoxO3a pathway.

We investigated the effects of fibroblast growth factor 8b and androgen on the proliferation of prostate cell lines and the corresponding intracellular mechanisms. It is found that dihydrotestosterone and fibroblast growth factor 8b stimulated Lncap cell mitosis in a concentration-responsive manner, with 30 ng/mL as the most suitable concentration, respectively. Dihydrotestosterone treatment alone did not enhance the expression and phosphorylation level of fibroblast growth factor receptor but significantly enhanced the level of fibroblast growth factor receptor phosphorylation elicited by fibroblast growth factor 8b. Phosphorylations of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase were stimulated by dihydrotestosterone or fibroblast growth factor 8b. Among these major downstream pathways for mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling was most significantly enhanced. Protein kinase C phosphorylation was higher than AKT by the combined stimulation of dihydrotestosterone and fibroblast growth factor 8b. The phosphorylation of CDC2 was significantly induced by dihydrotestosterone and fibroblast growth factor 8b synergetically, and Smad underwent the same induction as CDC2. So the promoting effect of fibroblast growth factor 8b on cell cycle might contribute to the G2/M transition. This study indicated that the functional interaction between fibroblast growth factor 8b and androgen was essential for the prostate cancer cell proliferation.""","""['Wen-Jun Xiao', 'Gui-Ming Zhang', 'Ding-Wei Ye']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Fibroblast growth factor 8 increases breast cancer cell growth by promoting cell cycle progression and by protecting against cell death.', 'Modulation of cell-cycle regulatory signaling network by 2-methoxyestradiol in prostate cancer cells is mediated through multiple signal transduction pathways.', 'Molecular roles of MAP kinases and FADD phosphorylation in prostate cancer.', 'The role of JNK in prostate cancer progression and therapeutic strategies.', 'The role of fibroblast growth factor 8 in cartilage development and disease.']"""

Lycopene is more bioavailable in tomato processed products than in raw tomatos, since formation of lycopene cis-isomers during food processing and storage may increase its biological activity. In the current study, we evaluated the influence of lycopene extracts (5 mg / mL) from different tomato-based food products (paste, sauce, extract and ketchup) on cell viability and apoptosis on primary human prostate cancer cells (PCa cels) for 96h. Using MTT assay, we observed a significant decrease on primary PCa cell viability upon treatment with lycopene extracted from either 4 tomato-based food products. Flow cytometeric analysis revealed that lycopene from tomato extract and tomato sauce promoted up to fifty-fold increase on the proportion of apoptotic cells, when compared to the control group. Using real time PCR assay, we found that lycopene promoted an upregulation of TP53 and Bax transcript expression and also downregulation of Bcl-2 expression in PCa cells. In conclusion, our data demostrate that cis-lycopene promoted a significant inhibition on primary PCa cell viability, as well as an increase on their apoptotic rates, evidencing that cis-lycopene contained in tomato sauce and extract cain mainly modulate of primary human prostate cancer cell survival.""","""['Nathalia da Costa Pereira Soares', 'Clara Lima Machado', 'Bruno Boquimpani Trindade', 'Ingridy Celestino do Canto Lima', 'Etel Rodrigues Pereira Gimba', 'Anderson Junger Teodoro', 'Christina Takiya', 'Radovan Borojevic']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Comparative Analysis of Lycopene Content from Different Tomato-Based Food Products on the Cellular Activity of Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Effects of tomato sauce consumption on apoptotic cell death in prostate benign hyperplasia and carcinoma.', 'cis-trans lycopene isomers, carotenoids, and retinol in the human prostate.', 'Bio-Availability, Anticancer Potential, and Chemical Data of Lycopene: An Overview and Technological Prospecting.', 'Scientific Evidence of the Beneficial Effects of Tomato Products on Cardiovascular Disease and Platelet Aggregation.', 'Overview of the Potential Beneficial Effects of Carotenoids on Consumer Health and Well-Being.', 'Novel Insights into the Role of the Antioxidants in Prostate Pathology.', 'The Antiaging Activities of Phytochemicals in Dark-Colored Plant Foods: Involvement of the Autophagy- and Apoptosis-Associated Pathways.', 'Cytotoxic evaluation and chemical investigation of tomatoes from plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grown in uncontaminated and experimentally contaminated soils.', 'Can Diet Prevent Urological Cancers?

A new prostate cancer model (Myc-CaP:PSMA(+)) and a second-generation anti-hPSMA human CAR T cells expressing a Click Beetle Red luciferase reporter) were used to study hPSMA targeting and assess CAR T cell trafficking and persistence by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). We investigated the antitumor efficacy of human CAR T cells targeting human prostate-specific membrane antigen (hPSMA), in the presence and absence of the target antigen; first alone and then combined with a monoclonal antibody targeting the human programmed death receptor 1 (anti-hPD1 mAb). PDL-1 expression was detected in Myc-CaP murine prostate tumors growing in immune competent FVB/N and immune-deficient SCID mice. Endogenous CD3+ T cells were restricted from the centers of Myc-CaP tumor nodules growing in FVB/N mice. Following anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) treatment, the restriction of CD3+ T cells was reversed, and a tumor-treatment response was observed. Adoptive hPSMA-CAR T cell immunotherapy was enhanced when combined with PD-1 blockade, but the treatment response was of comparatively short duration, suggesting other immune modulation mechanisms exist and restrict CAR T cell targeting, function, and persistence in hPSMA expressing Myc-CaP tumors. Interestingly, an ""inverse pattern"" of CAR T cell BLI intensity was observed in control and test tumors, which suggests CAR T cells undergo changes leading to a loss of signal and/or number following hPSMA-specific activation. The lower BLI signal intensity in the hPSMA test tumors (compared with controls) is due in part to a decrease in T cell mitochondrial function following T cell activation, which may limit the intensity of the ATP-dependent Luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence signal.""","""['Inna Serganova', 'Ekaterina Moroz', 'Ivan Cohen', 'Maxim Moroz', 'Mayuresh Mane', 'Juan Zurita', 'Larissa Shenker', 'Vladimir Ponomarev', 'Ronald Blasberg']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Mol Ther Oncolytics""","""['Lactate Dehydrogenase A Depletion Alters MyC-CaP Tumor Metabolism, Microenvironment, and CAR T Cell Therapy.', 'Monitoring the efficacy of adoptively transferred prostate cancer-targeted human T lymphocytes with PET and bioluminescence imaging.', 'Combined treatment with anti-PSMA CAR NK-92 cell and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody enhances the antitumour efficacy against castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Immune checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy in hematologic malignancies.', 'Incorporation of Immune Checkpoint Blockade into Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells (CAR-Ts): Combination or Built-In CAR-T.', 'CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Ovarian Cancer: A Promising Cell Therapy.', '4-1BB-Based CAR T Cells Effectively Reverse Exhaustion and Enhance the Anti-Tumor Immune Response through Autocrine PD-L1 scFv Antibody.', 'Combining of Oncolytic Virotherapy and Other Immunotherapeutic Approaches in Cancer: A Powerful Functionalization Tactic.', 'Optimization of the proliferation and persistency of CAR T cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.', 'Checkpoint inhibitors as immunotherapy for fungal infections: Promises, challenges, and unanswered questions.']"""

Numerous studies have investigated the antiproliferative effects of various extracts of different Morus species, but studies involving the in vitro cytotoxic effect of M. nigra extract are very limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of dimethyl sulfoxide extract of M. nigra (DEM) and to investigate, for the first time, the probable cytotoxic effect in human prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cells together with the mechanism involved. Methods: Total polyphenolic contents (TPC), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and phenolic compounds of DEM were evaluated using spectrophotometric procedures and HPLC. The cytotoxic effect of DEM on PC-3 cells was revealed using the MTT assay. Mechanisms involved in the cytotoxic effect of DEM on PC-3 cells were then investigated in terms of apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and cell cycle using flow cytometry, while caspase activity was investigated using luminometric analysis. Results: TPC and FRAP values were 20.7 ± 0.3 mg gallic acid equivalents and 48.8 ± 1.6 mg trolox equivalents per g sample, respectively. Ascorbic acid and chlorogenic acid were the major phenolic compounds detected at HPLC analysis. DEM arrested the cell cycle of PC-3 cells at the G1 phase, induced apoptosis via increased caspase activity and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential.

This analysis was designed to describe outcomes for the subgroup of men from PREVAIL with specific sites of visceral disease to help clinicians understand how these patients responded to enzalutamide prior to chemotherapy.  Patients and methods:   Prespecified analyses examined the coprimary endpoints of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) only. All other efficacy analyses were post hoc. The visceral subgroup was divided into liver or lung subsets. Patients with both liver and lung metastases were included in the liver subset.  Results:   Of the 1717 patients in PREVAIL, 204 (12%) had visceral metastases at screening (liver only or liver/lung metastases, n = 74; lung only metastases, n = 130). In patients with liver metastases, enzalutamide was associated with an improvement in rPFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.90) but not OS (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.57-1.87). In patients with lung metastases only, the HR for rPFS (0.14; 95% CI, 0.06-0.36) and the HR for OS (0.59; 95% CI, 0.33-1.06) favored enzalutamide over placebo. Patients with liver metastases had worse outcomes than those with lung metastases, regardless of treatment. Enzalutamide was well tolerated in patients with visceral disease.
