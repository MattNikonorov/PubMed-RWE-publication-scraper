Although a vast repertoire of chemotherapeutics is currently available for treating cancer, a technique for rapidly identifying the right drug based on the chemo-resistivity of the cancer cells is not available and it currently takes weeks to months to evaluate the response of cancer patients to a drug. A sensitive, low-cost diagnostic assay capable of rapidly evaluating the effect of a series of drugs on cancer cells can significantly change the paradigm in cancer treatment management. Integration of microfluidics and electrical sensing modality in a 3D tumour microenvironment may provide a powerful platform to tackle this issue. Here, we report a 3D microfluidic platform that could be potentially used for a real-time deterministic analysis of the success rate of a chemotherapeutic drug in less than 12h. The platform (66mm×50mm; L×W) is integrated with the microsensors (interdigitated gold electrodes with width and spacing 10µm) that can measure the change in the electrical response of cancer cells seeded in a 3D extra cellular matrix when a chemotherapeutic drug is flown next to the matrix. B16-F10 mouse melanoma, 4T1 mouse breast cancer, and DU 145 human prostate cancer cells were used as clinical models. The change in impedance magnitude on flowing chemotherapeutics drugs measured at 12h for drug-susceptible and drug tolerant breast cancer cells compared to control were 50,552±144 Ω and 28,786±233 Ω, respectively, while that of drug-susceptible melanoma cells were 40,197±222 Ω and 4069±79 Ω, respectively. In case of prostate cancer the impedance change between susceptible and resistant cells were 8971±1515 Ω and 3281±429 Ω, respectively, which demonstrated that the microfluidic platform was capable of delineating drug susceptible cells, drug tolerant, and drug resistant cells in less than 12h.""","""['Hardik J Pandya', 'Karan Dhingra', 'Devbalaji Prabhakar', 'Vineethkrishna Chandrasekar', 'Siva Kumar Natarajan', 'Anish S Vasan', 'Ashish Kulkarni', 'Hadi Shafiee']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Microfluidic Biosensor-Based Devices for Rapid Diagnosis and Effective Anti-cancer Therapeutic Monitoring for Breast Cancer Metastasis.', 'Microfluidic chip with integrated electrical cell-impedance sensing for monitoring single cancer cell migration in three-dimensional matrixes.', 'Improved microfluidic platform for simultaneous multiple drug screening towards personalized treatment.', 'Near-physiological microenvironment simulation on chip to evaluate drug resistance of different loci in tumour mass.', 'Microfluidic 3D models of cancer.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.', 'A comparative study of tumour-on-chip models with patient-derived xenografts for predicting chemotherapy efficacy in colorectal cancer patients.', 'Microfluidic Biosensor-Based Devices for Rapid Diagnosis and Effective Anti-cancer Therapeutic Monitoring for Breast Cancer Metastasis.', 'Going with the Flow: Modeling the Tumor Microenvironment Using Microfluidic Technology.', 'Research advances of high-throughput cell-based drug screening systems based on microfluidic technique.']"""

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of blunt-tip needles in the surgery.  Methods:   Cases of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy were reviewed. If a blunt-tip needle had been used to suture the DVC, the patient was recruited to the blunt-tip group. If a regular needle was used, the patient was recruited to the control group. Patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded.  Results:   One hundred and nine cases were reviewed. A blunt-tip needle was used to suture the DVC in 67 cases, and a regular needle in 42 cases. All characteristics of the two groups are comparable (p > 0.05). In 66 cases in the blunt-tip group, no sutures or coagulations were needed when suturing the DVC, Five cases of DVC-related bleeding were observed in the control group, which is higher than in the blunt-tip group (p = 0.031). At the same time, no catheter was sutured in the blunt-tip group. All patients were followed for at least six months. The continence rate in the blunt-tip group is 89.6%, significantly higher than in the control group (73.8%, p = 0.031).  Conclusions:   Using a blunt-tip needle to suture the DVC may reduce DVC-related bleeding and provide a better surgical field. It may be helpful in improving postoperative continence. However, its effect on positive margin at the apex still needs further investigation.""","""['Chao Zhang', 'Huiqing Wang', 'Chen Ye', 'Fei Guo', 'Bo Yang', 'Chuanliang Xu', 'Yinghao Sun']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Med Robot""","""['The progress of dorsal vascular complex control strategy in radical prostatectomy.', 'Suture versus staple ligation of the dorsal venous complex during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'The use of a laparoscopic bulldog clamp to control the dorsal vein complex during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a novel technique.', 'Standard vs delayed ligature of the dorsal vascular complex during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results from a randomized controlled trial.', 'Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'The progress of dorsal vascular complex control strategy in radical prostatectomy.', 'Use of a linear stapler for urethral and dorsal vein complex transection during laparoscopic total pelvic exenteration in rectal cancer.']"""

Elucidating pathways that drive survival and invasiveness of NDRG1-deficient prostate cancer cells can help in designing therapeutics to target metastatic prostate cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms that lead NDRG1-deficient prostate cancer cells to increased invasiveness remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that NDRG1-deficient prostate tumors have decreased integrin expression and reduced cell adhesion and motility. Our data indicate that loss of NDRG1 differentially affects Rho GTPases. Specifically, there is a downregulation of active RhoA and Rac1 GTPases with a concomitant upregulation of active Cdc42 in NDRG1-deficient cells. Live cell imaging using a fluorescent sensor that binds to polymerized actin revealed that NDRG1-deficient cells have restricted actin dynamics, thereby affecting cell migration. These cellular and molecular characteristics are in sharp contrast to what is expected after loss of a metastasis suppressor. We further demonstrate that NDRG1-deficient cells have increased resistance to anoikis and increased invasiveness which is independent of its elevated Cdc42 activity. Furthermore, NDRG1 regulates expression and glycosylation of EMMPRIN, a master regulator of matrix metalloproteases. NDRG1 deficiency leads to an increase in EMMPRIN expression with a concomitant increase in matrix metalloproteases and thus invadopodial activity. Using a three-dimensional invasion assay and an in vivo metastasis assay for human prostate xenografts, we demonstrate that NDRG1-deficient prostate cancer cells exhibit a collective invasion phenotype and are highly invasive. Thus, our findings provide novel insights suggesting that loss of NDRG1 leads to a decrease in actin-mediated cellular motility but an increase in cellular invasion, resulting in increased tumor dissemination which positively impacts metastatic outcome.""","""['Anup Sharma', 'Janet Mendonca', 'James Ying', 'Hea-Soo Kim', 'James E Verdone', 'Jelani C Zarif', 'Michael Carducci', 'Hans Hammers', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Sushant Kachhap']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['The metastasis suppressor, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), upregulates p21 via p53-independent mechanisms.', 'Downregulation of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 caused by the methylation of CpG islands of NDRG1 promoter promotes proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'The proto-oncogene c-Src and its downstream signaling pathways are inhibited by the metastasis suppressor, NDRG1.', 'The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1: a Janus-faced molecule in cellular signaling.', 'Molecular functions of the iron-regulated metastasis suppressor, NDRG1, and its potential as a molecular target for cancer therapy.', 'N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 inhibition of tumor progression in Caco2 cells.', 'NDRG1 in Cancer: A Suppressor, Promoter, or Both?', 'Prognostic and biological role of the N-Myc downstream-regulated gene family in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Protein signatures to distinguish aggressive from indolent prostate cancer.', 'A Small Peptide Targeting the Ligand-Induced Androgen Receptor/Filamin a Interaction Inhibits the Invasive Phenotype of Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

The cancer cells interactions within the surrounding bone environment are critical for tumor growth and progression. Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is described to be involved in PCa cells migration and invasion into bone. Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro systems that are able to closely resemble the in vivo microenvironment are recently taking importance in cancer research. Original nanohydroxyapatite/collagen scaffolds were designed to resemble bone microenvironment in order to be applied as substitutes in bone defects and as potential biomaterials to mimic skeletal tumors. In fact, these 3D structures were cytocompatible and able to support osteoblast (MC3T3-E1) colonization and to promote bone ingrowth. Additionally, SPARC adsorption onto the scaffolds affected PC3 and LNCaP PCa cell lines behavior. PC3 cells were found to adapt and colonize the scaffolds, differing from LNCaP where cells underwent morphogenic changes and grew as clusters. Furthermore, for the tested SPARC concentration, SPARC plays a role in retaining LNCaP cells at the latter time points while with PC3 cells no significant differences were observed. This characterization study is required to establish a bone model to provide new insights into the poorly understood PCa mechanisms of metastasis to bone and the generation of improved therapies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Materials and methods:   We collected data on 441 men with M0 CRPC in 2000-2015 at five Veterans Affairs hospitals. Cox models were used to test the association between log-transformed PSADT and the development of metastasis, ACM and PCSM. To identify thresholds, we categorized PSADT into 3-month groups and then combined groups with similar hazard ratios (HRs).  Results:   The median (interquartile range) follow-up was 28.3 (14.7-49.1) months. As a continuous variable, PSADT was associated with metastases, ACM and PCSM (HR 1.40-1.68, all P < 0.001). We identified the following PSADT thresholds: <3 months; 3-8.9 months; 9-14. months; and ≥15 months. As a categorical variable, PSADT was associated with metastases, ACM and PCSM (all P < 0.001). Specifically, PSADT <3 months was associated with an approximately ninefold increased risk of metastases (HR 8.63, 95% CI 5.07-14.7) and PCSM (HR 9.29, 95% CI 5.38-16.0), and a 4.7-fold increased risk of ACM (HR 4.71, 95% CI 2.98-7.43) on multivariable analysis compared with PSADT ≥15 months. The median times to metastasis for patients with PSADT <3, 3-8.9, 9-14.9 and ≥15 months were 9, 19, 40 and 50 months, respectively.  Conclusion:   Prostate-specific antigen doubling time was a strong predictor of metastases, ACM and PCSM in patients with M0 CRPC. As with patients at earlier disease stages, <3, 3-8.9, 9-14.9 and ≥15 months are reasonable PSADT thresholds for risk stratification in men with M0 CRPC. These thresholds can be used for selecting high-risk men for clinical trials.""","""['Lauren E Howard', 'Daniel M Moreira', 'Amanda De Hoedt', 'William J Aronson', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Christopher L Amling', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Martha K Terris', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Impact of age, comorbidity, and PSA doubling time on long-term competing risks for mortality among men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Positive surgical margins in radical prostatectomy patients do not predict long-term oncological outcomes: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) cohort.', 'Does Early Prostate Specific Antigen Doubling Time after Radical Prostatectomy, Calculated Prior to Prostate Specific Antigen Recurrence, Correlate with Prostate Cancer Outcomes?

Limited stability (2 h) was found for abiraterone in fresh plasma as well as whole blood at ambient temperature. When kept at 2-8°C, abiraterone in plasma was stable for 24 h and in whole blood for 8 h. Adsorption of abiraterone to glass materials was addressed by using polypropylene throughout the method. Carry-over was reduced to acceptable limits by incorporating a third mobile phase into the gradient. The chromatographic separation of abiraterone with its multiple metabolites was addressed by using a longer analytical column and adjusting the gradient. Abiraterone was extracted by protein precipitation, separated on a C18 column with gradient elution and analyzed with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry in positive ion mode. A stable deuterated isotope was used as the internal standard. The assay ranges from 1 to 500 ng/mL. Within- and-between-day precisions and accuracies were below 13.4% and within 95-102%.

Design:   Retrospective cohort study.  Data source:   United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink.  Patients:   A total of 119,912 adults with no previous cancer diagnosis who were new users of AMOABs-darifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin, solifenacin, tolterodine, or trospium-between January 2004 and December 2012.  Measurements and main results:   Sex-specific incidence rates per 1000 person-years and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each study cancer (bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreatic, prostate, renal, and uterine cancer) overall and stratified by time since cohort entry and by cumulative AMOAB dose. Among the 119,912 patients followed for 399,365 person-years, 4117 incident study cancers occurred. The incidence rate of prostate cancer was 14.2 (95% CI 12.9-15.5) in the year after cohort entry and decreased markedly thereafter. The incidence rate of bladder cancer was also higher in the year after cohort entry than subsequently (men: 5.5, 95% CI 4.8-6.4; women: 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5). The incidence rates of both prostate and bladder cancer decreased with increasing cumulative dose of AMOAB. We observed no similar relations between incidence rates of other study cancers and time since cohort entry.  Conclusion:   High incidence rates of bladder and prostate cancer soon after AMOAB initiation and a negative correlation between incidence and cumulative AMOAB dose suggest that protopathic bias is a more likely explanation for these findings than causality. (Protopathic bias in this context means patients' urinary symptoms prompted treatment with an AMOAB, but the symptoms were actually due to a cancer that was already present, although not yet diagnosed or not yet recorded.) To avoid unnecessary delays in the diagnosis of prostate and bladder cancer, physicians should consider these diseases in patients for whom treatment with AMOABs is indicated.""","""['James A Kaye', 'Andrea V Margulis', 'Joan Fortuny', 'Lisa J McQuay', 'Estel Plana', 'Jennifer L Bartsch', 'Christine L Bui', 'Susana Perez-Gutthann', 'Alejandro Arana']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pharmacotherapy""","""['Incidence of Common Cancers in Users of Antimuscarinic Medications for Overactive Bladder: A Danish Nationwide Cohort Study.', 'Variation in Cardiovascular Risk Related to Individual Antimuscarinic Drugs Used to Treat Overactive Bladder: A UK Cohort Study.', 'Receipt of Overactive Bladder Drugs and Incident Dementia: A Population-based Case-control Study.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis: do clinical trials testing antimuscarinic agents for overactive bladder adequately measure central nervous system adverse events?', 'Tolterodine for the treatment of overactive bladder.', 'β 3 Adrenergic Receptor Stimulation Promotes Reperfusion in Ischemic Limbs in a Murine Diabetic Model.', 'Initial Patterns of Prescription Opioid Supply and Risk of Mortality Among Insured Adults in the United States.', 'Muscarinic receptors promote castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer through a FAK-YAP signaling axis.', 'Validation of Cancer Cases Using Primary Care, Cancer Registry, and Hospitalization Data in the United Kingdom.']"""

Methods:   Among black men in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, we identified 226 prostate cancer cases and 452 controls matched on age at randomization (±5 years), date of blood draw (±30 days), calendar year of cohort entry, and time since baseline prostate cancer screening (±1 year). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], vitamin D binding protein (DBP), the 25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio, and prostate cancer risk.  Results:   Serum 25(OH)D was not associated with overall prostate cancer (Q4 vs Q1: OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.40-1.33; P for trend = .25), although there were apparent inverse associations for nonaggressive disease (global P = .03, clinical stage I/II, and Gleason score <7) and among men ≥62 years old (P for interaction = .04) that were restricted to Q3. Interestingly, serum DBP was significantly inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (Q4 vs Q1: OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20-1.00; P for trend = .03), whereas the 25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio was not. Results were similar when we mutually adjusted for 25(OH)D and DBP, and we found no evidence of interaction between the two.  Conclusion:   Our study suggests higher (versus lower) circulating DBP may be independently associated with a decreased prostate cancer risk in black men independent of 25(OH)D status.

Summary answer:   By using a high-resolution light microscopy (HRLM) method, which enables an improved visualization of germ cell morphological features, we identified all testicular germ cells in the seminiferous epithelium and precisely grouped them in six well-delimitated SEC stages, thus providing a reliable reference source for staging in man.  What is already known:   Morphological characterization of germ cells in human has been done decades ago with the use of conventional histological methods (formaldehyde-based fixative -Zenker-formal- and paraffin embedding). These early studies proposed a classification of the SEC in six stages. However, the use of stages as baseline for morphofunctional evaluations of testicular parenchyma has been difficult because of incomplete morphological identification of germ cells and their random distribution in the human SEC.  Study design, size, duration:   Testicular tissue from adult and elderly donors with normal spermatogenesis according to Levin's, Johnsen's and Bergmann's scores were used to evaluate germ cell morphology and validate their distribution and frequency in stages throughout human spermatogenesis.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   Testicular tissue from patients diagnosed with congenital bilateral agenesis of vas deferens (n = 3 adults) or prostate cancer (n = 3 elderly) were fixed in glutaraldehyde and embedded in araldite epoxy resin. Morphological analyses were performed by both light and transmission electron microscopy.  Main results and the role of chance:   HRLM method enabled a reliable morphological identification of all germ cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids) based on high-resolution aspects of euchromatin, heterochromatin and nucleolus. Moreover, acrosomal development of spermatids was clearly revealed. Altogether, our data redefined the limits of each stage leading to a more reliable determination of the SEC in man.  Limitations, reasons for caution:   Occasionally, germ cells can be absent in some tubular sections. In this situation, it has to be taken into account the germ cell association proposed in the present study to classify the stages.  Wider implications of the findings:   Our findings bring a new focus on the morphology and development of germ cells during the SEC in human. Application of HRLM may be a valuable tool for research studies and clinical andrology helping to understand some testicular diseases and infertility conditions which remain unsolved.

Methods:   We investigated 573 consecutive men with PSA of ≤20 ng/ml who underwent prostate biopsy between 2004 and 2013. The initial 14-core biopsy consisted of the sextant type, lateral sites at the base and middle, lateral apices (la) at anterior horn sites, and apical anterior sites (aa). The repeated 18-core biopsy consisted of the initial 14-core biopsy with four transition zone (TZ) sites at the base (tzb) and middle (tzm).  Results:   Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 178 (38.9%) of 458 men with the initial 14-core biopsy, and 44 (38.3%) of 115 men with the repeated 18-core biopsy. In the initial biopsy setting, the unique cancer detection rate was high in apical sites (apex, la, and aa: 6.2%, 6.2% and 5.1%, respectively). In the repeated setting, it was high in the TZ site in addition to the apical site (apex, la, aa, tzm, and tzb: 6.8%, 6.8%, 11.4%, 9.1% and 11.4%, respectively). The positive SM rate at the apex was higher in patients whose cancer was detected only in sites other than the sextant region than for those in the sextant region (36.4% vs. 14.8%, P = 0.037).  Conclusions:   The initial 14-core and the repeated 18-core biopsy scheme including apical anterior cores are feasible for prostate cancer detection.

This parasite has been identified as responsible for the increased risk of transmission of HIV and has also been associated with prostate and cervical cancer. Many carriers of T. vaginalis are asymptomatic and, when experiencing a health problem, they most often have nonspecific symptoms. The aim of this research was to estimate the presence of T. vaginalis and the associated factors in women of childbearing age at a primary health care clinic in the Federal District of Brazil.  Methodology:   A cross-sectional study was conducted with consecutive sampling of an outpatient population of women of childbearing age (excluding minors and pregnant women). The women answered a questionnaire and were examined. After vaginal pH measurement and whiff testing, a vaginal secretion sample was obtained for inoculation in TYM, a specific T. vaginalis culture medium.  Results:   The presence of T. vaginalis was identified in 16% of the sample. Fewer lifetime sexual partners and consistent condom use were identified as factors of protection against the infection. Complaints of dyspareunia were proportionally higher among women with positive cultures for T. vaginalis.  Conclusions:   The prevalence of T. vaginalis infection was high in the sample studied. The infection was positively associated with the number of lifetime sexual partners, and consistent condom use was a protective factor. Vaginal complaints were more common among women with T. vaginalis, but only dyspareunia had significant association.""","""['Mateus De Paula von Glehn', 'Lana Cristina Evangelista Ferreira Sá', 'Hian Delfino Ferreira da Silva', 'Eleuza Rodrigues Machado']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Infect Dev Ctries""","""['Prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis infection and protozoan load in South African women: a cross-sectional study.', 'Prevalence and risk factors for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis infection in pregnant women in Papua New Guinea.', 'Trichomonas vaginalis infection in Nigerian pregnant women and risk factors associated with sexually transmitted infections.', 'Prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis Donné in women of Lódź population in 1955-1999 years.', 'Global epidemiology and control of Trichomonas vaginalis.', 'Detection of metronidazole resistance in Trichomonas vaginalis using uncultured vaginal swabs.', 'Trichomonas infection in pregnant women: a nationwide cohort study.', 'Trichomonas vaginalis follow-up and persistence in Colombian women.', 'A review on Trichomonas vaginalis infections in women from Africa.', 'Distribution of genotypes in relation to metronidazole susceptibility patterns in Trichomonas vaginalis isolated from South African pregnant women.']"""

Objective:   To perform a comparative analysis of the health impact of symptomatic ACSD to US normative and chronic disease values using EQ-5D (EuroQuol-5 Dimensions questionnaire) scores.  Methods:   ACSD patients presenting for surgical treatment were identified from a prospectively collected multicenter database. Baseline demographics and EQ-5D scores were collected and compared with US normative and disease state values.  Results:   Of 121 ACSD patients, 115 (95%) completed the EQ-5D (60% women, mean age 61 years, previous spine surgery in 44%). Diagnoses included kyphosis with mid-cervical (63.4%), cervico-thoracic (23.5%), or thoracic (8.7%) apex and primary coronal deformity (4.3%). The mean ACSD EQ-5D index was 0.511 (standard definition = 0.224), which is 34% below the bottom 25th percentile (0.780) for similar age- and gender-matched US normative populations. Mean ACSD EQ-5D index values were worse than the bottom 25th percentile for several other disease states, including chronic ischemic heart disease (0.708), malignant breast cancer (0.708), and malignant prostate cancer (0.708). ACSD mean index values were comparable to the bottom 25th percentile values for blindness/low vision (0.543), emphysema (0.508), renal failure (0.506), and stroke (0.463).

Our results showed that the expression of COX-2 and Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) was upregulated in highly invasive PCa cells and was correlated with the activated levels of membrane-anchored serine protease matriptase. The expression levels of COX-2 were increased and were correlated with matriptase levels in PCa specimens. Moreover, results showed that COX-2 overexpression or a COX-2 product Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) caused an increase in matriptase activation and PCa cell invasion, whereas COX-2 silencing antagonized matriptase activation and cell invasion.

To date, no treatment has substantially changed its course, which makes urgent need for the development of novel drugs or novel formulations for drug delivery. Nanomedicine has enormous potential to improve the accuracy of cancer therapy by enhancing availability and stability, decreasing effective doses and reducing side effects of drugs. Camptothecin (CPT) is an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase-I with several anticancer properties but has poor solubility and a high degradation rate. Previously, we reported that CPT encapsulated in β-cyclodextrin-nanosponges (CN-CPT) increased solubility, was protected from degradation and inhibited the growth of prostate tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this study was to extend that work by assessing the CN-CPT effectiveness on ATC both in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that CN-CPT significantly inhibited viability, clonogenic capacity and cell-cycle progression of ATC cell lines showing a faster and enhanced effect compared to free CPT. Moreover, CN-CPT inhibited tumor cell adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, migration, secretion of pro-angiogenic factors (IL-8 and VEGF-α), expression of β-PIX, belonging to the Rho family activators, and phosphorylation of the Erk1/2 MAPK. Finally, CN-CPT significantly inhibited the growth, the metastatization and the vascularization of orthotopic ATC xenografts in SCID/beige mice without apparent toxic effects in vivo.

Wnt3a-conditioned medium (Wnt3a-CM) promotes the growth of LNCaP cells and increases AR and YAP protein levels. Moreover, Wnt3a-CM induces the nuclear translocation of YAP and the AR, but not β-catenin, thereby activating the expression of AR- and YAP-dependent genes, in an androgen-independent manner. In addition, depletion of YAP with small interfering RNA (siRNA) prevented Wnt3a-CM-mediated up-regulation of AR-dependent gene expression.

Methods and materials:   Patients were eligible if aged ≥65 years and diagnosed with breast, non-small cell lung, prostate, head and neck, rectal, or esophageal cancer, and were referred for curative radiation therapy. We recorded acute toxicity and noncompliance and identified potential predictors, including the G8 and TGUGT.  Results:   We investigated 402 patients with a median age of 72 years (range, 65-96 years). According to the G8, 44.4% of the patients were frail. Toxicity grade ≥3 was observed in 22% of patients who were frail according to the G8 and 9.1% of patients who were not frail. The difference was 13% (confidence interval 5.2%-20%; P=.0006). According to the TGUGT 18.8% of the patients were frail; 21% of the frail according to the TGUGT developed toxicity grade ≥3, compared with 13% who were not frail. The difference was 7.3% (confidence interval -2.7% to 17%; P=.11). Overall compliance was 95%. Toxicity was most strongly associated with type of primary tumor, chemotherapy, age, and World Health Organization performance status. Compliance was associated with type of primary tumor and age.  Conclusions:   The usefulness of the TGUGT and G8 score in daily practice seems to be limited.

Methods:   The cytotoxic effects of papaverine were examined by the MTT cell viability assay. Flow cytometry using annexin V-FITC/PI was used to study the effects on apoptosis, including its quantification. Effects on cell cycle progression were analyzed by flow cytometry while as effects on apoptosis-related proteins, NF-kB and PI3K/Akt pathways were estimated by Western blot assay.  Results:   The results indicated that papaverine could induce significant, highly selective and dose-dependent cytotoxic effects in PC-3 cells without causing too much toxicity in normal cells. Papaverine also led to induction of early and late apoptosis along with inducing sub-G1 cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner. Papaverine induced a dose-dependent reduction in the expression levels of Blc-2 proteins and a dose-dependent increase in the expression levels of Bax protein. The expression levels of NF-kB were decreased markedly in comparison to the untreated control. Papaverine treatment also led to a dose-dependent downregulation of PI3K and phospho-Akt expression.  Conclusion:   Papaverine showed selective antitumor properties against PC-3 human prostate cancer cells by inducing early and late apoptosis, sub-G1 cell cycle arrest, modulation of apoptosis-related proteins like Bcl-2, Bax, Bid, XIAP and cytochrome C along with downregulation of NFkB, PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.""","""['Hang Huang', 'Lin-Jin Li', 'Hai-Bo Zhang', 'An-Yang Wei']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['Mycotoxin verrucarin A inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by inhibiting prosurvival Akt/NF-kB/mTOR signaling.', 'SRJ23, a new semisynthetic andrographolide derivative: in vitro growth inhibition and mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Anticancer activity of ursolic acid on human ovarian cancer cells via ROS and MMP mediated apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and downregulation of PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'An Overview of the Potential Antineoplastic Effects of Casticin.', 'Cellular pathways involved in silica nanoparticles induced apoptosis: A systematic review of in vitro studies.', 'Papaverine: A Miraculous Alkaloid from Opium and Its Multimedicinal Application.', 'Papaver Plants: Current Insights on Phytochemical and Nutritional Composition Along with Biotechnological Applications.', 'The Biological Relevance of Papaverine in Cancer Cells.', 'In Vitro Effects of Papaverine on Cell Migration and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor in Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Grainyhead 1 acts as a drug-inducible conserved transcriptional regulator linked to insulin signaling and lifespan.']"""

After PDT treatment, ClAlPc-NC-treated LNCaP cells exhibited a higher green fluorescence signal, possibly due to the larger shrinkage of the actin cytoskeleton, compared to ClAlPc-NE-treated LNCaP cells. Additionally, ClAlPc-NC or ClAlPc-NE and mitochondria showed a relatively high co-localization level.

This study examines the mode-of-action and antitumor efficacy of radium-223 in two prostate cancer xenograft models.Experimental Design: Mice bearing intratibial LNCaP or LuCaP 58 tumors were randomized into groups (n = 12-17) based on lesion grade and/or serum PSA level and administered radium-223 (300 kBq/kg) or vehicle, twice at 4-week intervals. X-rays and serum samples were obtained biweekly. Soft tissue tumors were observed macroscopically at sacrifice. Tibiae were analyzed by gamma counter, micro-CT, autoradiography and histology.Results: Radium-223 inhibited tumor-induced osteoblastic bone growth and protected normal bone architecture, leading to reduced bone volume in LNCaP and abiraterone-resistant LuCaP 58 models. Furthermore, radium-223 resulted in lower PSA values and reduced total tissue and tumor areas, indicating that treatment constrains prostate cancer growth in bone. In addition, radium-223 suppressed abnormal bone metabolic activity as evidenced by decreased number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts and reduced level of the bone formation marker PINP. Mode-of-action studies revealed that radium-223 was deposited in the intratumoral bone matrix. DNA double-strand breaks were induced in cancer cells within 24 hours after radium-223 treatment, and PSA levels were significantly lower 72 hours after treatment, providing further evidence of the antitumor effects.Conclusions: Taken together, radium-223 therapy exhibits a dual targeting mode-of-action that induces tumor cell death and suppresses tumor-induced pathologic bone formation in tumor microenvironment of osseous CRPC growth in mice.

Together with oak, sweet chestnut wood (Castanea sativa) have been often used for such purpose. The maturation process involves the transfer of secondary metabolites, mainly phenolics, from the wood to the liquid. At the same time, other metabolites, such as triterpenoids and their glycosides, can also be released. Searching for the extractable triterpenoids from sweet chestnut heartwood (C. sativa), two new ursane-type triterpenoid saponins named chestnoside A (1) and chestnoside B (2), together with two known oleanen-type analogs (3 and 4) were isolated and characterized. The cytotoxicity of isolated compounds was tested against two cancer cell lines (PC3 and MCF-7), and normal lymphocytes. Breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were more affected by tested compounds than prostate cancer cells (PC3). Chestnoside B (2) exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity with an IC50 of 12.3 μM against MCF-7 cells, lower than those of positive controls, while it was moderately active against normal lymphocytes (IC50 = 67.2 μM).

Methods:   We investigated 2-stage biomarker-based screening strategies in the context of prostate cancer using a partially observable Markov model to simulate patients' progression through prostate cancer states to mortality from prostate cancer or other causes. Patients were screened every 2 years from ages 55 to 69. If the patient's serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was over a specified threshold in the first stage, a second stage biomarker test was administered. We evaluated design characteristics for these 2-stage strategies using 7 newly discovered biomarkers as examples. Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the number of screening biopsies, prostate cancer deaths, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per 1000 men.  Results:   The all-cancer biomarkers significantly underperformed the high-grade cancer biomarkers in terms of QALYs. The screening strategy that used a PSA threshold of 2 ng/mL and a second biomarker test with high-grade sensitivity and specificity of 0.86 and 0.62, respectively, maximized QALYs. This strategy resulted in a prostate cancer death rate within 1% of using PSA alone with a threshold of 2 ng/mL, while reducing the number of biopsies by 20%. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the results are robust with respect to variation in model parameters.  Conclusions:   Two-stage biomarker screening strategies using new biomarkers with risk thresholds optimized for high-grade cancer detection may increase quality-adjusted survival and reduce unnecessary biopsies.""","""['Christine L Barnett', 'Scott A Tomlins', 'Daniel J Underwood', 'John T Wei', 'Todd M Morgan', 'James E Montie', 'Brian T Denton']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Comparative efficiency of prostate-specific antigen screening strategies for prostate cancer detection.', 'The cost-effectiveness of prostate health index for prostate cancer detection in Chinese men.', 'Optimization of PSA screening policies: a comparison of the patient and societal perspectives.', 'American Urological Association (AUA) guideline on prostate cancer detection: process and rationale.', 'Prevention of Prostate Cancer Morbidity and Mortality: Primary Prevention and Early Detection.', 'A ppm Ethanol Sensor Based on Fabry-Perot Interferometric Surface Stress Transducer at Room Temperature.', '18F-Choline PET/mpMRI for Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: Part 2.

Short tandem repeat (STR) sequences are extremely reliable genetic markers for the detection of LOH associated with cancers. Hence, in the current study, we investigated the detection of LOH at 6 STR markers (D8S360, D9S1748, D9S171, D8S137, D6S1631, and THRB) using blood circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which can be used to distinguish PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A total of 136 individuals were included in the study, 76 male patients diagnosed with PCa (50 male patients with localized PCa and 26 male patients with metastatic PCa) as experimental subjects and 60 male patients with BPH as controls. Circulating cfDNA was extracted from plasma samples and amplified with fluorescence-labeled primers specific for known STR markers. We also evaluated the serum prostate-specific antigen in both groups. Our findings revealed that the frequency of LOH at D8S360, D9S1748, D9S171, D8S137, and D6S1631 was significantly higher in PCa subjects than in controls (P<0.05). Of the 6 STR markers, LOH at D8S360 could discriminate metastatic PCa from localized PCa. We found that 71.05% of patients with PCa and 1.66% of BPH subjects had LOH at least at 3 of the markers in cfDNA. Our findings provide additional evidence to support the hypothesis that analysis of LOH at D8S360, D9S1748, D9S171, D8S137, and D6S1631 STR markers using cfDNA can be applied as a noninvasive diagnostic approach for the detection of PCa.""","""['S-Maryam Seyedolmohadessin', 'Mohammad T Akbari', 'Zahra Nourmohammadi', 'Abbas Basiri', 'Gholamreza Pourmand']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol""","""['Comparison of genetic alterations detected in circulating microsatellite DNA in blood plasma samples of patients with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Identification of loss of heterozygosity on circulating free DNA in peripheral blood of prostate cancer patients: potential and technical improvements.', 'Detection of tumor-specific DNA in blood and bone marrow plasma from patients with prostate cancer.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

We hypothesize that these agents synergistically impact cell growth based on their complementary mechanisms of action with HMG CoA reductase. d-δ-tocotrienol (0-40 µmol/L; half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 15 µmol/L) and geranylgeraniol (0-100 µmol/L; IC50 = 60 µmol/L) each induced concentration-dependent suppression of the growth of human DU145 prostate carcinoma cells. Blends of the two agents synergistically suppressed the growth of DU145 cells, with combination index values ranging 0.67-0.75. While 7.5 µmol/L d-δ-tocotrienol and 30 µmol/L geranylgeraniol individually had no impact on cell cycle distribution in DU145 cells, a blend of the agents induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase.

Herein we explore the use of glycogen nanoparticles as a biosourced glycoscaffold for engineering multivalent glyconanoparticles. Glycogen nanoparticles, a naturally occurring highly branched polymer of glucose, was functionalized with lactose, achieved through copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition chemistry, for targeted interaction with lectins ex situ and on prostate cancer cells. The lactosylated glycogen, which contains terminal β-galactoside moieties, is termed galacto-glycogen (GG), and is found to interact strongly with peanut agglutinin (PNA), a β-galactoside-specific lectin, as observed by optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and quartz crystal microbalance measurements. The GG nanoparticles exhibit multivalent binding to PNA with an affinity constant of 3.4 × 105 M-1, and the GG-PNA complex cannot be displaced by lactose, demonstrating the competitive binding of GG to the lectin. These GG nanoparticles were tested for association with prostate cancer cell membranes in vitro, where the particles exhibited a high affinity for the membrane, as observed from flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. This is inferred to result from specific extracellular galectin-1 targeting. Furthermore, the GG nanoparticles induce aggregation between prostate cancer cells.

As the rapid development of high-throughput experimental technology, gene expression experiments have become more and more specialized and diversified. The complex data structure has brought great challenge for the identification of biomarkers. In the meantime, current statistical and machine learning methods for detecting biomarkers have the problem of low reliability and biased criteria.  Results:   This study aims to select combinatorial miRNA biomarkers, which have higher sensitivity and specificity than single-gene biomarkers. In order to avoid exhaustive search and redundant information, miRNAs are firstly clustered, then the combinations of representative cluster members are assessed as potential biomarkers. Both the criteria for the partition of clusters and selection of representative members are based on Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FDA). The FDA-based criterion has been demonstrated to be superior to three other criteria in selecting representative members, and also good at refining clusters. In the comparison with eight common feature selection methods, this clustering-based method performs the best with regard to the discriminative ability of selected biomarkers.

The signaling network comprising the integral constituents of the signature pathways involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer is modeled as a combinatorial circuit. The failures in the gene regulatory network that lead to cancer are abstracted as faults in the equivalent circuit and the Boolean circuit model is then used to design therapies tailored to counteract the effect of each molecular abnormality and to propose potentially efficacious combinatorial therapy regimens.

Methods:   We present a computational strategy to systematically rank and investigate a large number (210-220) of clinically testable gene sets, using combinatorial gene subset generation and disease-free survival (DFS) analyses. This approach integrates protein-protein interaction networks, gene expression, DNA methylation, and copy number data, in association with DFS profiles from patient clinical records.  Results:   As a case study, we applied this pipeline to systematically analyze the role of ALDH1A2 in prostate cancer (PCa). We have previously found this gene to have multiple roles in disease and homeostasis, and here we investigate the role of the associated ALDH1A2 gene/protein networks in PCa, using our methodology in combination with PCa patient clinical profiles from ICGC and TCGA databases. Relationships between gene signatures and relapse were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) log-rank analysis and multivariable Cox regression. Relative expression versus pooled mean from diploid population was used for z-statistics calculation. Gene/protein interaction network analyses generated 11 core genes associated with ALDH1A2; combinatorial ranking of the power set of these core genes identified two gene sets (out of 211 - 1 = 2,047 combinations) with significant correlation with disease relapse (KM log rank p < 0.05). For the more significant of these two sets, referred to as the optimal gene set (OGS), patients have median survival 62.7 months with OGS alterations compared to >150 months without OGS alterations (p = 0.0248, hazard ratio = 2.213, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-4.098). Two genes comprising OGS (CYP26A1 and RDH10) are strongly associated with ALDH1A2 in the retinoic acid (RA) pathways, suggesting a major role of RA signaling in early PCa progression.

Asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation could play a significant role in the pathological mechanism of these vesicles. We investigated if prostatic protein N-glycosylation profiles were related to urinary vesicle-associated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) extractability and if this parameter showed diagnostic potential for PCa.  Methods:   Urinary extracellular vesicles were visualised using transmission electron microscopy. Urinary extracellular vesicles extraction by means of n-butanol allowed determination of urinary vesicle-associated PSA extractability. Diagnostic value was assessed between benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; n=122) and patients with PCa (n=85). Additionally, correlation with urine N-glycosylation was assessed.  Results:   Urinary extracellular vesicles with a diameter of approximately 100 nm were more abundantly present in urine of patients with PCa versus patients with BPH resulting in a higher vesicle-associated PSA extraction ratio (p<0.001). Next, vesicle-associated PSA extraction ratio was correlated to biantennary core-fucosylation (p=0.003). Finally, vesicle-associated PSA extraction ratio proved beneficial in PCa diagnosis, next to serum PSA and the urinary glycosylation marker (p=0.021).  Conclusions:   The urinary vesicle-associated PSA extraction ratio is increased in PCa which is a direct result of the abundant presence of extracellular vesicles in urine of patients with PCa. The urinary vesicle-associated PSA extraction ratio was associated with changes in N-glycoforms and showed diagnostic potential.

However, in spite of the great potency to kill tumor cells, gelonin lacks ability to internalize tumor cells and furthermore, cannot distinguish between tumor and normal cells. To address this challenge, we genetically engineered gelonin fusion proteins with varied numbers of F3 peptide possessing homing ability to various cancer cells and angiogenic blood vessels. The E. coli produced F3-gelonin fusion proteins possessed equipotent activity to inhibit protein translation in cell-free protein translation systems to unmodified gelonin; however, they displayed higher cell uptake that led to significantly augmented cytotoxicity. Compared with gelonin fusion with one F3 peptide (F3-Gel), tandem-multimeric F3-gelonins showed even greater cell internalization and tumor cell killing ability. Moreover, when tested against LNCaP s.c. xenograft tumor bearing mice, more significant tumor growth inhibition was observed from the mice treated with tandem-multimeric F3-gelonins.

However, no information is available regarding its functional mechanism and the chemo-sensitization effects on different kinds of human cancer cells. We found that treatment of demethoxyfumitremorgin C inhibited the cell viability of PC3 human advanced prostate cancer cells, induced apoptosis as determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Demethoxyfumitremorgin C induced apoptosis was associated with downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins: Ras, PI3K, Akt, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2, and upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax.

While stratification approaches using various biomarkers (including high-throughput gene expression measurements) for patient-to-patient comparisons have been successful in elucidating previously unseen subtypes, there remains an untapped potential of incorporating various genotypic and phenotypic data to discover novel or improved groupings.  Methods:   Here, we present HOCUS, a unified analytical framework for patient stratification that uses a community detection technique to extract subtypes out of sparse patient measurements. HOCUS constructs a patient-to-patient network from similarities in the data and iteratively groups and reconstructs the network into higher order clusters. We investigate the merits of using higher-order correlations to cluster samples of cancer patients in terms of their associations with survival outcomes.  Results:   In an initial test of the method, the approach identifies cancer subtypes in mutation data of glioblastoma, ovarian, breast, prostate, and bladder cancers. In several cases, HOCUS provides an improvement over using the molecular features directly to compare samples. Application of HOCUS to glioblastoma images reveals a size and location classification of tumors that improves over human expert-based stratification.  Conclusions:   Subtypes based on higher order features can reveal comparable or distinct groupings. The distinct solutions can provide biologically- and treatment-relevant solutions that are just as significant as solutions based on the original data.""","""['Kiley Graim', 'Tiffany Ting Liu', 'Achal S Achrol', 'Evan O Paull', 'Yulia Newton', 'Steven D Chang', 'Griffith R Harsh th', 'Sergio P Cordero', 'Daniel L Rubin', 'Joshua M Stuart']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['Pathway Relevance Ranking for Tumor Samples through Network-Based Data Integration.', 'Imaging-genomics reveals driving pathways of MRI derived volumetric tumor phenotype features in Glioblastoma.', 'Integrative, multimodal analysis of glioblastoma using TCGA molecular data, pathology images, and clinical outcomes.', 'Radiogenomics and imaging phenotypes in glioblastoma: novel observations and correlation with molecular characteristics.', 'Biobanking: An Important Resource for Precision Medicine in Glioblastoma.', 'Heterogeneity of Glycolytic Phenotype Determined by 18F-FDG PET/CT Using Coefficient of Variation in Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'The Biological Meaning of Radiomic Features.', ""Network modeling of patients' biomolecular profiles for clinical phenotype/outcome prediction."", 'Big data hurdles in precision medicine and precision public health.']"""

Super-enhancers are cell-specific DNA elements, acting to determine tissue or cell identity and driving tumor progression. Although previous approaches have been tried to explain risk associated with SNPs in regulatory DNA elements, so far epigenetic readers such as bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4) and super-enhancers have not been used to annotate SNPs. In prostate cancer (PC), androgen receptor (AR) binding sites to chromatin have been used to inform functional annotations of SNPs.  Results:   Here we establish criteria for enhancer mapping which are applicable to other diseases and traits to achieve the optimal tissue-specific enrichment of PC risk SNPs. We used stratified Q-Q plots and Fisher test to assess the differential enrichment of SNPs mapping to specific categories of enhancers. We find that BRD4 is the key discriminant of tissue-specific enhancers, showing that it is more powerful than AR binding information to capture PC specific risk loci, and can be used with similar effect in breast cancer (BC) and applied to other diseases such as schizophrenia.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to evaluate the enrichment of epigenetic readers in genome-wide associations studies for SNPs within enhancers, and provides a powerful tool for enriching and prioritizing PC and BC genetic risk loci.

The specific requirement is to accurately define the border between the photothermal lesion and native tissue as the photothermal lesion grows, with an accuracy of ? 1 ?? mm , so treatment can be terminated before there is damage to the rectal wall. To demonstrate the feasibility of the shape-based diffuse optical tomography reconstruction, simulated data were generated based on forward calculations in known geometries that include the prostate, rectum, and lesions of varying dimensions. The only source of optical contrast between the lesion and prostate was increased scattering in the lesion, as is typically observed with coagulation. With noise added to these forward calculations, lesion dimensions were reconstructed using the shape-based method.

Methods:   We identified 30,964 patients from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan who had newly diagnosed PCa between 2000 and 2010. Each patient was randomly frequency-matched with an individual without PCa, based on age, comorbidity, and index year. Competing-risks regression models were used to estimate subhazard ratios (SHRs) of SPMs development associated with PCa. The Bonferroni adjustment was used in multiple comparisons.  Results:   Men with PCa had a trend of lower risk of developing overall SPMs compared to those without PCa (adjusted SHR = 0.94, 99.72% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89-1.00, p = 0.06). The risks of lung and liver cancer were significantly lower. In contrast, these patients had a significantly higher risk of thyroid cancer. There is a trend for a higher risk of developing SPMs in the urinary bladder and rectum/anus. Further analyses indicated that PCa patients who received radiation therapy (RT) had an increased risk of overall SPMs, hematologic malignancies, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, and urinary bladder cancer compared with those who did not receive RT.

Here, we expanded our cohort size to better characterize the prognostic significance of AR-V7 in this setting. Methods We prospectively enrolled 202 patients with CRPC starting abiraterone or enzalutamide and investigated the prognostic value of CTC detection (+ v -) and AR-V7 detection (+ v -) using a CTC-based AR-V7 mRNA assay. We examined ≥ 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses, PSA progression-free survival, clinical and radiologic progression-free survival, and overall survival. We constructed multivariable models adjusting for PSA, Gleason sum, number of prior hormone therapies, prior abiraterone or enzalutamide use, prior taxane use, presence of visceral metastases, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score. We also separately examined the first-line and second-line novel hormonal therapy (NHT) settings. Results Median follow-up times were 15.0, 21.7, and 14.6 months for CTC-, CTC+/AR-V7- and CTC+/AR-V7+ patients, respectively. CTC+/AR-V7+ patients were more likely to have Gleason scores ≥ 8 ( P = .05), metastatic disease at diagnosis ( P = .01), higher PSA ( P < .01), prior abiraterone or enzalutamide use ( P = .03), prior taxane use ( P = .02), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ≥ 1 ( P = .01). Outcomes for the overall cohort (and separately for the first-line and second-line NHT cohorts) were best for CTC- patients, intermediate for CTC+/AR-V7- patients, and worse for CTC+/AR-V7+ patients. These correlations remained significant in multivariable models. Conclusion This expanded analysis further characterizes the importance of CTC-based AR-V7 mRNA detection in predicting outcomes in patients with CRPC receiving first- and second-line NHT and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to suggest that this assay be interpreted using three separate prognostic categories: CTC-, CTC+/AR-V7-, and CTC+/AR-V7+.""","""['Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Changxue Lu', 'Brandon Luber', 'Hao Wang', 'Yan Chen', 'Yezi Zhu', 'John L Silberstein', 'Maritza N Taylor', 'Benjamin L Maughan', 'Samuel R Denmeade', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Channing J Paller', 'Michael A Carducci', 'Mario A Eisenberger', 'Jun Luo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Association Between Androgen Receptor Splice Variants and Prostate Cancer Resistance to Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', ""Re: Emmanuel S.

It was aimed to compare three commercially available antibodies in the detection of different surface epitopes of fibroblasts (anti-fibroblast, fibroblast activation protein α, and fibroblast surface protein). The specificity of their expression, employing fibroblast cell lines and tumor-derived fibroblasts from breast and prostate tissues was investigated. Both the established fibroblast cell line HFF-1 and ex vivo primary fibroblasts isolated from breast and prostate cancer tissues expressed the tested surface markers to different degrees. Surprisingly, those markers were expressed also by permanent cell lines of epithelial origin, both benign and cancer-derived (breast-cell lines MCF 10A, HMLE and prostate-cell lines BPH-1, DU 145, and PC-3). The expression of fibroblast activation protein α increased on the surface of previously described models of epithelial cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in response to treatment with TGF-β1. To prove the co-expression of the fibroblast markers on cells of epithelial origin, we used freshly dissociated human prostate and breast cancer tissues. The results confirmed the co-expression of anti-fibroblast and fibroblast surface protein on CD31/CD45-negative/EpCAM-positive epithelial cells. In summary, our data support the findings that the tested fibroblast markers are not fibroblast specific and may be expressed also by cells of epithelial origin (e.g., cells undergoing EMT). Therefore, the expression of these markers should be interpreted with caution, and the combination of several epitopes for both positive (anti-fibroblast or fibroblast activation protein α) and negative (EpCAM) identification of fibroblasts from breast and prostate tumor tissues is advised. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.""","""['Zuzana Kahounová', 'Daniela Kurfürstová', 'Jan Bouchal', 'Gvantsa Kharaishvili', 'Jiří Navrátil', 'Ján Remšík', 'Šárka Šimečková', 'Vladimír Študent', 'Alois Kozubík', 'Karel Souček']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cytometry A""","""['Stromal fibroblast activation protein alpha promotes gastric cancer progression via epithelial-mesenchymal transition through Wnt/ β-catenin pathway.', 'TGF-β1-activated cancer-associated fibroblasts promote breast cancer invasion, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by autophagy or overexpression of FAP-α.', 'Fibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancer.', 'Fibroblast activation protein in remodeling tissues.', 'The role of fibroblast activation protein in health and malignancy.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts: from basic science to anticancer therapy.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts in gynecological malignancies: are they really allies of the enemy?', 'FSP-1 expression in cancer cells is relevant to long-term oncological outcomes in nonmetastatic colorectal cancer.', 'Cell-specific expression of the FAP gene is regulated by enhancer elements.', 'Development of Nectin4/FAP-targeted CAR-T cells secreting IL-7, CCL19, and IL-12 for malignant solid tumors.']"""

Materials and methods:   Twelve consecutive cases with 14 separate ADC restriction areas, positive for cancer in the peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) were included. All had 3 Tesla MRI and radical prostatectomy. Ten regions of interest (ROIs) within and outside the 14 ADC restriction areas positive for cancer were selected. For each ROI, we performed quantitative analysis of (a) prostate benign and malignant histological component surface ratios, including stroma, glands, epithelium, lumen, cellular nuclei; (b) percent of Gleason grades and measures of ADC values. Means of histological components according to ADC restriction for cancerous area were compared with analyses of variance with repeated measures.  Results:   Independent predictors of the probability of cancer were median epithelium/ROI ratio (P = 0.001) and nuclei/ROI ratio (P = 0.03). Independent predictors of the probability of ADC restriction were malignant glands/ROI and luminal space/ROI (P < 0.0001). Effect of malignant glands/ROI area was different according to the localization of the ROI (P = 0.03). We observed an overall difference between the means for all of the histological components for the comparison of true positive and false negative (P < 0.0001), except for the percent of Gleason grade 4 (P = 0.18). In TZ cancers, a predominant grade 3 pattern was associated with low ADC values. In PZ cancers, a predominant grade 4 pattern was associated with low ADC values.  Conclusion:   Determinants of low ADC were high ratio of malignant glands/ROI area which may be seen in Gleason grades 3 or 4 cancers.  Level of evidence:   3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J. Magn.

CHD1 loss represents a distinct PCa subtype characterized by SPOP mutation and higher genomic instability. However, the role of CHD1 in PCa development in vivo and its clinical utility remain unclear.  Patients and methods:   To study the role of CHD1 in PCa development and its loss in clinical management, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model with prostate-specific deletion of murine Chd1 as well as isogenic CHD1 wild-type and homozygous deleted human benign and PCa lines. We also developed patient-derived organoid cultures and screened patients with metastatic PCa for CHD1 loss.  Results:   We demonstrate that CHD1 loss sensitizes cells to DNA damage and causes a synthetic lethal response to DNA damaging therapy in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo, in patient-derived organoid cultures and in a patient with metastatic PCa. Mechanistically, CHD1 regulates 53BP1 stability and CHD1 loss leads to decreased error-free homologous recombination (HR) repair, which is compensated by increased error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair.  Conclusions:   Our study provides the first in vivo and in patient evidence supporting the role of CHD1 in DSB repair and in response to DNA damaging therapy. We uncover mechanistic insights that CHD1 modulates the choice between HR and NHEJ DSB repair and suggest that CHD1 loss may contribute to the genomic instability seen in this subset of PCas.""","""['T R Shenoy', 'G Boysen', 'M Y Wang', 'Q Z Xu', 'W Guo', 'F M Koh', 'C Wang', 'L Z Zhang', 'Y Wang', 'V Gil', 'S Aziz', 'R Christova', 'D N Rodrigues', 'M Crespo', 'P Rescigno', 'N Tunariu', 'R Riisnaes', 'Z Zafeiriou', 'P Flohr', 'W Yuan', 'E Knight', 'A Swain', 'M Ramalho-Santos', 'D Y Xu', 'J de Bono', 'H Wu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['CHD1: a new treatment biomarker for recombination deficiency in castration resistant prostate cancer?', 'CHD1 and SPOP synergistically protect prostate epithelial cells from DNA damage.', 'Loss of CHD1 causes DNA repair defects and enhances prostate cancer therapeutic responsiveness.', 'Regulation of DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice: a new focus on 53BP1.', 'Tumors overexpressing RNF168 show altered DNA repair and responses to genotoxic treatments, genomic instability and resistance to proteotoxic stress.', 'Roles for 53BP1 in the repair of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks.', ""Let's Go 3D!

In Italy most of doctors tend to request both total and free PSA for their patients even in cases where the total PSA doesn't justify the further request of free PSA, with a consequent growth of the costs for the National Health System. The aim of our study was to predict the saving in Euro (due to reagents) and reduction in free PSA tests, applying the ""PSA Reflex"" algorithm.  Methods:   We calculated the number of total PSA and free PSA exams performed in 2014 in the Hospital of Grosseto and, simulating the application of the ""PSA Reflex"" algorithm in the same year, we calculated the decrease in the number of free PSA requests and we tried to predict the Euro savings in reagents, obtained from this reduction.  Results:   In 2014 in the Hospital of Grosseto 25,955 total PSA tests have been performed: 3,631 (14%) resulted greater than 10 ng / ml; 7,686 (29.6%) between 2 and 10 ng / ml; 14,638 (56.4%) lower than 2 ng / ml. The performed free PSA tests were 16904. Simulating the use of ""PSA Reflex"" algorithm, the free PSA tests would be performed only in cases with total PSA values between 2 and 10 ng / mL with a saving of 54.5% of free PSA exams and of 8,971 euros, only for reagents.  Conclusions:   Our study showed that the ""PSA Reflex"" algorithm is a valid alternative leading to a reduction of the costs.

Patients and methods:   Overall, 51 men agreed to a physical prostate examination and an expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) test within 2 weeks after torso F-FDG PET/CT scans. We then reviewed the F-FDG PET/CT scans of the enrolled patients and evaluated the relationship between the F-FDG PET/CT, prostate-specific antigen, and prostatic laboratory findings.  Results:   The pathological diagnosis of five men indicated the presence of prostate cancer, and of the remaining 46 men, 27 cases showed IPU in the F-FDG PET/CT whereas 19 did not. The characteristics of the enrolled patients were as follows: mean age of 61.15±13.79 years (range: 30-83 years), maximum standardized uptake value of 2.64±1.33 (range: 1.2-7.1), and prostate-specific antigen of 3.10±3.50 ng/ml (range: 0.16-13.55 ng/ml). Ten of the 27 (37%) patients with IPU in the PET/CT scan showed bacterial infections in their prostate. A multivariate analysis indicated that the bacterial presence in the EPS increased the risk of IPU (adjusted odds ratio: 9.167; P=0.019).

Thus, in the present study, we have investigated the anti-tumor mechanism of auraptene mainly in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, because auraptene suppressed the viability of androgen-independent PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells better than androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. Also, auraptene notably increased sub-G1 cell population and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells as features of apoptosis in two prostate cancer cells compared with untreated control. Consistently, auraptene cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, suppressed the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2 and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), and also activated pro-apoptotic protein Bax in both prostate cancer cells. However, Mcl-1 overexpression reversed the apoptotic effect of auraptene to increase sub-G1 population and induce caspase-9/3 in both prostate cancer cells. Taken together, the results support scientific evidences that auraptene induces apoptosis in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells via Mcl-1-mediated activation of caspases as a potent chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer prevention and treatment.

In the rare case of concomitant renal insufficiency requiring haemodialysis (HD), an estimation of the contamination of dialysate would be beneficial.  Methods:   The excretion of 223Ra and its concentration in the dialysate in a patient with mCRPC and end-stage renal disease was examined for six consecutive treatment cycles. Dialysate samples were measured using a commercial system with NaI-scintillation detector.  Results:   HD showed a residual activity level in the remaining dialysate. The excreted activity was a median of 46.1 kBq (range = 42.0- 83.4 kBq) and 11.2 kBq (range = 8.4- 19.9 kBq) for the first (24 h post injection p.i.) and second HD (96 h p.i.), respectively. The activity concentration decreased significantly from a median of 4.18 kBq/l (range = 2.98-5.14 kBq/l) to 0.85 kBq/l (range = 0.69- 1.31 kBq/l, p < 0.0001). For all consecutive time points, the activity concentration further decreased significantly (p < 0.0001). The activity concentration of dialysate from HD performed 125.4 h p.i. [95 % confidence interval = 120.5-130.4 h p.i.] reached the threshold for unrestricted waste disposal.  Conclusion:   The observed extraction of 223Ra by HD exceeded the data determined from the phase-I study. The activity concentration in the dialysate observed for the first HD's p.i. was above the threshold for unrestricted disposal of radioactive waste in Germany.

Two hundred and thirty patients with clinically high-risk PCa underwent immediate ADT, and 75 patients with intermediate risk PCa underwent deferred ADT. CRMP4 methylation levels in biopsies were determined, and CAPRA-S scores were calculated. In the deferred ADT group, the values of the hazard ratios for tumor progression and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in patients with ≥15% CRMP4 methylation were 6.81 (95% CI: 2.34-19.80) and 12.83 (95% CI: 2.16-26.10), respectively. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that CRMP4 methylation levels ≥15% served as a significant prognostic marker of tumor progression and CSM. In the immediate ADT group, CAPRA-S scores ≥6 and CRMP4 methylation levels ≥15% were independent predictors of these outcomes (uni- and multi-variable Cox regression analyses). The differences in the 5-year progression-free survival between each combination were statistically significant. Combining CAPRA-S score and CRMP4 methylation levels improved the area under the curve compared with the CRMP4 or CAPRA-S model.

Background:   There is international evidence to support the case that LGBT patients with cancer are less likely to report poor health or self-disclose sexual orientation. Gender-specific cancers, such as prostate cancer, require particular interventions in terms of supportive care. These may include advice about side-effect management (such as incontinence or erectile dysfunction), treatment choices and social and emotional issues. In this paper, we discuss and analyse the heteronormative assumptions and culture that exist around this cancer. We argue that this situation may act as a barrier to effective supportive care for all Lesbian women, Gay, Transgender and Bisexual patients, in this case men who have sex with men. [Correction added on 21 September 2017, after first online publication: The first sentence of the Background section has been revised for clarity in this current version.] DESIGN: Theoretical exploration of heteronormativity considered against the clinical context of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Identification and inclusion of relevant international evidence combined with clinical discussion.  Results:   This paper posits a number of questions around heteronormativity in relation to prostate cancer information provision, supportive care and male sexuality. While assumptions regarding sexual orientation should be avoided in clinical encounters, this may be difficult when heteronormative assumptions dominate. Existing research supports the assertion that patient experience, including the needs of LGBT patients, should be central to service developments.  Conclusion:   Assumptions about sexual orientation should be avoided and recorded accurately and sensitively, and relational models of care should be promoted at the start of cancer treatment in an appropriate manner. These may assist in reducing the risks of embarrassment or offence to nonheterosexual patients, or to professionals who may adopt heteronormative assumptions.  Relevance to clinical practice:   Having an awareness of the risks of making heteronormative assumptions in clinical practice will be useful for all health professionals engaged in prostate cancer care.

Background:   Hispanics, including Puerto Ricans, are an understudied population who are under-represented in clinical trials, especially in symptom research. Although symptom management is a clinical priority in oncology care, treatment-related differences in Puerto Rican cancer patients' report of fatigue severity have not been well described.  Design/methods:   A cross-sectional survey was conducted from data of self-report of 138 Puerto Rican patients during and postcancer treatments at two ambulatory facilities located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Fatigue severity was assessed using the Fatigue subscale from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue quality of life questionnaire Spanish version. Differences in fatigue severity across type of treatment (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, combined radiation chemotherapy and post-treatment) were evaluated using nonparametric (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney test) statistical tests.  Results:   The majority of the participants had prostate (33%) and breast (32%) cancers and were receiving radiation therapy (43%) or chemotherapy (28%). The Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was a statistically significant difference in fatigue scores between the different four treatment conditions, χ2 (3) = 39.1, p = .001 with patients on combined radiation chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone experiencing more severe fatigue.  Conclusions:   Findings from the current study suggest that type of treatment is a key component of the symptom burden of fatigue among the Puerto Rican oncology population. Specially, patients receiving combined therapy or chemotherapy alone were at increased risk for experiencing severe fatigue, compared to radiation therapy and post-treatment patients.  Relevance to clinical practice:   With the worldwide increase in migration of Puerto Rican families, nurses need to recognise that type of treatment is a key component of the symptom burden of fatigue among the Puerto Rican population. The results of this study will improve understanding of treatment-related fatigue to identify therapeutic targets and improve quality of life of patients.""","""['Velda J Gonzalez', 'Cindy S Tofthagen', 'Xusheng Chen', 'Elsa Pedro', 'Leorey N Saligan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Nurs""","""['Gene Expression, and Fatigue in Puerto Rican Men during Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: an Exploratory Study.', 'Symptom Burden: Experiences of Puerto Rican Men With Prostate Cancer Prior to External Beam Radiation Therapy.', 'The symptom experiences of Puerto Rican children undergoing cancer treatments and alleviation practices as reported by their mothers.', 'A review of barriers to effective asthma management in Puerto Ricans: cultural, healthcare system and pharmacogenomic issues.', 'The prevalence and severity of fatigue in men with prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'The Health related Quality of Life of Puerto Ricans during Cancer Treatments; A Pilot Study.', 'Gene Expression, and Fatigue in Puerto Rican Men during Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: an Exploratory Study.']"""

A subset of paraneoplastic retinopathy is characterized by negative-type electroretinography (ERG) without fundus abnormality. Here we describe the multimodal imaging and clinico-pathological correlation of a unique case of acute progressive paravascular placoid neuroretinopathy with suspected retinal depolarizing bipolar cell dysfunction preceding the diagnosis of metastatic small cell carcinoma of the prostate.  Methods:   ERG was performed according to the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision standards. Imaging modalities included near-infrared reflectance, blue-light autofluorescence, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, ultra-widefield colour and green-light autofluorescence imaging, microperimetry and adaptive optics imaging. Patient serum was screened for anti-retinal antibodies using western blotting. Immunostaining and histological analyses were performed on sections from human retinal tissues and a patient prostate biopsy.  Results:   Serial multimodal retinal imaging, microperimetry and adaptive optics photography demonstrated a paravascular distribution of placoid lesions characterized by hyper-reflectivity within the outer nuclear layer resembling type 2 acute macular neuroretinopathy. There was no visible lesion within the inner nuclear layer despite electronegative-type ERG. Six months later, the patient presented with metastatic small cell carcinoma of the prostate. Tumour cells were immunopositive for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase and recoverin as well as neuroendocrine markers. The patient's serum reacted to cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens in the prostate biopsy and in human retina. Anti-retinal antibodies against several antigens were detected by both commercial and in-house western blots.  Conclusions:   A spectrum of autoreactive anti-retinal antibodies is associated with a unique phenotype of acute progressive paravascular placoid neuroretinopathy resulting in degeneration of photoreceptor cells, inner retinal dysfunction and classic electronegative ERG in paraneoplastic retinopathy.

Recently, DCLK1 has been reported to act as an intestinal tumor stem cell marker and has been shown to be expressed in cancer cells and in the stroma of breast, colon, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Here, we studied DCLK1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by immunohistochemistry in association with clinicopathological factors and patient prognosis.  Methods:   DCLK1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens from 232 patients with pathological stage I NSCLC, including 187 adenocarcinomas. Relationships between the expression status of DCLK1 and clinicopathological factors were examined. The impact of DCLK1 expression status and other clinicopathological factors on survival was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses.  Results:   Thirty-three (14.2%) of 232 patients had DCLK1-positive cancer cells. DCLK1 was also expressed in the tumor stroma in most of the specimens and was significantly associated with DCLK1 expression in cancer cells. DCLK1-positive cancer cells were more common in non-adenocarcinoma tissues (44.4%) than in adenocarcinoma tissues (7.0%). Moreover, positive DCLK1 expression in cancer cells and stromal cells was correlated with a worse prognosis. Histological analyses revealed that the presence of DCLK1-positive cancer cells was an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in adenocarcinoma, but was not significantly associated with prognosis in non-adenocarcinoma.  Conclusions:   DCLK1 expression was observed in tumor cells in patients with pathological stage I NSCLC and was correlated with adverse prognosis, especially in patients with adenocarcinoma.

Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor arising from neuroblast cells of the autonomic nervous system, which is the most common cancer diagnosed in infants. It has been reported that YB-1 is highly expressing in various human tumors including nasopharynx, thyroid, lung, breast, colon, ovary, and prostate cancers. This study aimed to investigate the functional role of YB-1 in neuroblastoma by silencing YB-1 using RNA interference (shRNA) in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We found that silencing of YB-1 decreased the proliferation, migration, and invasion of SH-SY5Y cells. At molecular level, inhibition of YB-1 decreased the expression level of PCNA as well as MMP-2 in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Also, we discovered that YB-1 silencing sensitized SH-SY5Y cells to cisplatin and promoted the apoptosis induced by cisplatin due to down-regulation of multidrug resistance (MDR) 1 protein via NF-κB signaling pathway.

Methods:   Cell viability was measured with an MTT assay. UDCA-induced apoptosis was determined with flow cytometric analysis. The expression levels of apoptosis-related signaling proteins were examined with Western blotting.  Results:   UDCA treatment significantly inhibited cell growth of DU145 in a dose-dependent manner. It induced cellular shrinkage and cytoplasmic blebs and accumulated the cells with sub-G1 DNA contents. Moreover, UDCA activated caspase 8, suggesting that UDCA-induced apoptosis is associated with extrinsic pathway. Consistent to this finding, UDCA increased the expressions of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor, death receptor 4 (DR4) and death receptor 5 (DR5), and TRAIL augmented the UDCA-induced cell death in DU145 cells. In addition, UDCA also increased the expressions of Bax and cytochrome c and decreased the expression of Bcl-xL in DU145 cells.

Methods/design:   In this trial, we evaluate and compare the PCa detection rates of multiparametric (mp)MRI-targeted biopsies, CEUS-targeted biopsies and systematic biopsies under ultrasound guidance in the same patients. After informed consent, 299 biopsy-naïve men will undergo mpMRI scanning and CEUS imaging 1 week prior to the prostate biopsy procedure. During the biopsy procedure, a systematic transrectal 12-core biopsy will be performed by one operator blinded for the imaging results and targeted biopsy procedure. Subsequently a maximum of 4 CEUS-targeted biopsies and/or 4 mpMRI-targeted biopsies of predefined locations determined by an expert CEUS reader using quantification techniques and an expert radiologist, respectively, will be taken by a second operator using an MRI-US fusion device.

Yet because of data limitations, little research examines differences in the occurrence of cancer incidence between immigrants and non-immigrants and among immigrants defined by region of birth and time in the host country. In particular it is not known whether a healthy immigrant effect is present for cancer and if so, whether this advantage is lost with additional years of residence in the host country.  Methods:   This paper uses a large data file from Statistics Canada that links Census information on immigrant status, socioeconomic status including educational attainment, and other person-level information with administrative data on cancer and mortality over a continuous 13 year period of observation. It estimates discrete and continuous time duration models to identify differences in cancer diagnosis by immigrant subgroup after controlling for a variety of potential confounders. Differences in historical smoking behavior are not observable at the individual level in the dataset but are accounted for indirectly using various methods.  Results:   Results in general confirm the existence of a healthy immigrant effect for cancer in that, overall, recent immigrants to Canada are significantly less likely than otherwise comparable non-immigrant Canadians to be diagnosed with any cancer and the most common forms of cancer by site. As well, this gap appears to decline with additional years in Canada for immigrant men and women, eventually converging to Canadian-born levels. Differentiating among immigrant subgroups by period of arrival and country of birth reveals significant variation across immigrant subgroups, with immigrant men and women from developing countries typically having a lower likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer than immigrants from the US, UK and continental Europe. As well, controlling for immigrant heterogeneity this way weakens the conclusion that the gap narrows with years in Canada. Immigrant men overall continue to exhibit convergence to Canadian-born levels for diagnosis of any cancer and for prostate cancer, while immigrant women exhibit narrowing over time only for breast cancer. Although smoking behavior is not directly observed, controlling for subgroup-specific lifetime smoking behavior using survey data has only a relatively minor effect on the estimated differences.  Conclusions:   The specificity of the results by cancer type, gender, immigrant status and ethnicity provides useful guidance for future research by helping to narrow the possible channels through which social and economic characteristics may be affecting cancer incidence.""","""['James Ted McDonald', 'Michael Farnworth', 'Zikuan Liu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Public Health""","""['Immigrant health, place effect and regional disparities in Canada.', 'Disaggregating Canadian immigrant smoking behaviour by country of birth.', 'An evaluation of the healthy immigrant effect with adolescents in Canada: Examinations of gender and length of residence.', 'Cancer in immigrants as a pointer to the causes of cancer.', ""Why is the 'healthy immigrant effect' different between European countries?"", 'Disparities in Healthcare Accessibility and Discrimination Faced by Black Quebecers: a Race and Language Perspective.', 'Cancer Prevention Literacy among Different Population Subgroups: Challenges and Enabling Factors for Adopting and Complying with Cancer Prevention Recommendations.', 'Cancer, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality in Iraqi- and Swedish-born individuals in Sweden: the MEDIM cohort study.', 'Patterns of care and outcomes in immigrants with non-small cell lung cancer.

Immunohistochemical staining was used to study protein expression in both tumor and the adjacent nonneoplastic mucosa of claudin 1, 4, and 7. To detect the DNA methylation pattern of CLDN1, 4, and 7, genomic DNA was extracted from both the tumor and the adjacent nonneoplastic mucosa. Methylation analysis was carried out using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Cell membrane staining intensity of all claudins was found significantly lower in colorectal cancer tissues when compared to paired normal mucosa (p ≤ 0.001). For claudin 4, the percentage of cells staining positively was also significantly reduced (p = 0.04). In normal mucosa, cytoplasm showed no staining for claudins in any patient, whereas in paired colorectal cancer tissues, significant cytoplasmic staining appeared both for claudin 1 (p = 0.04) and claudin 4 (p = 0.01).

Such variability may be explained by institutional differences in prostate grossing protocols. Either partial or complete submission of the prostate gland in RCP may result in detection of clinically insignificant or significant incidental PCa. The aim of the study was to compare the clinical significance of PCa in RCP specimens in partial versus complete sampling.  Material:   Seventy-two out of 158 RCP cases showed incidental PCa. The pathologic features, including Gleason score, margin status, extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), PCa stage, and tumor volume, were assessed.  Results:   The 72 cases were divided into partial (n = 21, 29.1%) and complete sampling (n = 51, 70.8%) groups. EPE was detected in 13/72 (18.1%) with 11/13 (84.6%) cases in the complete group. Positive margins were present in 11/72 (15.3%) with 9/11 (81.8%) in the complete group. SVI was detected in 4/72 (5.6%) with 3/4 (75.0%) in the complete group. Overall, 4/72 (5.6%) had a Gleason score >7, all of which were in the complete group.

Patients and methods:   We prospectively recruited 1,001 PCa cases from a tertiary hospital and conducted a case-control study including 2,641 healthy men (Stage I). Participants were analyzed using HumanExome BeadChip. For the external validation, additionally enrolled 514 PCa cases and 548 controls (independent cohort) were analyzed for the identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Stage I (Stage II). The GRS was calculated as a non-weighted sum of the risk allele counts and investigated for accuracy of prediction of PCa.  Results:   the mean age was 66.3 years, and the median level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 9.19 ng/ml in PCa cases.

We had earlier described the interaction between septin 9 isoform 1 (SEPT9_i1) protein and the oxygen-regulated subunit, HIF-1α. SEPT9_i1 is a member of the conserved family of GTP-binding cytoskeleton septins. SEPT9_i1 stabilizes HIF-1α and facilitates its cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation. We utilized split yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) methodology to monitor the interaction between HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1 in live cells. N-terminal (YN) and C-terminal (YC) split YFP chimeras with HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1 on both their amino and carboxyl termini were generated. HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1 chimeras were expressed in cancer cells and screened for functional complementation. SEPT9_i1-YN and YC-HIF-1α formed a long-lived highly stable complex upon interaction. The BiFC signal was increased in the presence of hypoxia-mimicking agents. In contrast, YC-ΔHLH-HIF-1α chimera, which lacked the helix-loop-helix domain that is essential for the interaction with SEPT9_i1 as well as the expression of SEPT9_i1 252-379 amino acids fragment required for the interaction with HIF-1α, significantly reduced the BiFC signal. The signal was also reduced when cells were treated with 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, an HSP90 inhibitor that inhibits HIF-1α. It was increased with fourchlorfenuron, a small molecule that increases the interaction between HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1. These results reconfirmed the interaction between HIF-1α and SEPT9_i1 that was imaged in live cells.

To study changes in gene expression, we looked at ""Tumor Metastasis"" and ""PI3K pathway"" using commercially available PCR arrays. In addition, we employed a microarray approach using the Affymetrix Hugene 2.0 ST array chip followed by analysis with Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software. In vitro studies showed that IL-15 decreased PCa cell motility at both concentrations. In vivo studies showed that IL-15 increased neutrophil infiltration, and the expression of adiponectin, desmin and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-sma) in the tumor tissue. Angiogenesis analysis, using CD31 immunohistochemistry, showed that IL-15 decreased the number of blood vessels. Gene expression analysis identified Cancer, Cell Death, Immune Response and Lipid Metabolism as the major diseases and functions altered in tumors treated with IL-15. This suggests that IL-15 causes inflammation and changes in stroma that can promote decreased tumor cell proliferation.""","""['Krizia Rohena-Rivera', 'María M Sánchez-Vázquez', 'Diana A Aponte-Colón', 'Ingrid S Forestier-Román', 'Mario E Quintero-Aguiló', 'Magaly Martínez-Ferrer']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Endothelial cells promote metastasis of prostate cancer by enhancing autophagy.', 'The biological functions and mechanism of miR‑212 in prostate cancer proliferation, migration and invasion via targeting Engrailed-2.', 'CD151 is associated with prostate cancer cell invasion and lymphangiogenesis in vivo.', 'Prostate cancer epidemiology.', 'Integrins in prostate cancer progression.', 'Potential clinical use of azacitidine and MEK inhibitor combination therapy in PTPN11-mutated juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.', 'Immunology Meets Bioengineering: Improving the Effectiveness of Glioblastoma Immunotherapy.', 'Ezetimibe and Cancer: Is There a Connection?', 'Deciphering the Role of Histone Modifications in Uterine Leiomyoma: Acetylation of H3K27 Regulates the Expression of Genes Involved in Proliferation, Cell Signaling, Cell Transport, Angiogenesis and Extracellular Matrix Formation.', 'Role of Cytokines and Chemokines in Angiogenesis in a Tumor Context.']"""

Materials and methods:   Three hundred F-FECH PET/CT scans were evaluated prospectively. The low-dose CT features of all cases were categorized as isodense, sclerotic, lytic or mixed lytic/sclerotic and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) values were calculated. Findings on F-FECH PET/CT were correlated with Technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate planar bone scans and serum prostate-specific antigen.  Results:   Patient age range was 50-90 years (median 71 years) and prostate-specific antigen values were in the range 0.04-372 ng/ml (Roche Modular method). Seventy-two lesions were detected on F-FECH PET/CT in 45 patients, including 31 (43%) in the pelvis, 17 (23%) in the spine (cervical 3, thoracic 8 and lumbar spine 6) and 10 (13%) in the ribs. Evaluation of low-dose CT in combination with PET helped to characterize benign findings in 21 (29%) lesions. The SUVmax for all except one benign lesion ranged from 0.49 to 2.15. In 51 (71%) lesions because of metastatic disease, SUVmax was 0.6-11.6 for those classified as sclerotic on low-dose CT, 0.7-8.58 for lytic lesions, 1.1-7.65 for isodense lesions and 1.27-3.53 for mixed lytic/sclerotic lesions. Of the 56 F-FECH-avid lesions, 21 lesions showed avidity on bone scan [3 (23%) of the 13 isodense lesions, 14 (40%) of the 35 sclerotic lesions, 2 (50%) of the lytic lesions and 2 (50%) of the mixed sclerotic/lytic lesions].  Conclusion:   F-FECH PET/CT identified bone lesions in 15% of patients with suspected prostate cancer relapse. SUVmax in isolation cannot be used to characterize these lesions as benign or malignant. Minimal overlap of benign and malignant lesions was observed above SUVmax of 2.5.

Little research has been conducted to date, to understand the specific unmet supportive care needs of this patient group within the context of current service delivery.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to understand the experiences of unmet supportive care needs of men affected by prostate cancer on hormone therapy in the United Kingdom.  Methods:   Mixed methods study recruited 31 men with ≥T3 prostate Cancer or worse and treated by hormone therapy. A small cross-sectional survey (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] C30 and PR25, Self-Management Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Supportive Care Needs Survey) was used to inform the interview schedule. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and framework approach was used to analyze the data.  Results:   Complex unmet supportive care needs that were related to physical, psychological/emotional, intimacy/sexual, practical, health system/informational, existential, and patient/clinician communication needs are experienced. Men articulated that current healthcare delivery is failing to provide a holistic person-centered model of care.  Conclusion:   This is one of the few studies that have identified the unmet supportive care needs of men receiving hormone therapy for ≥T3 prostate Cancer or worse. The needs are multiple and far-ranging.  Implications for practice:   Despite national cancer reforms, unmet supportive care needs persist. The findings from this study may be central in the re-design of future services to optimize men's quality of life and satisfaction with care.

Label fusion is a crucial step in MAS to cope with the segmentation variabilities among multiple atlases. However, most existing label fusion methods do not consider the potential dosimetric impact of the segmentation result. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose a novel geometry-dosimetry label fusion method for MAS-based OAR auto-contouring, which evaluates the segmentation performance in terms of both geometric accuracy and the dosimetric impact of the segmentation accuracy on the resulting treatment plan. Differently from the original selective and iterative method for performance level estimation (SIMPLE), we evaluated and rejected the atlases based on both Dice similarity coefficient and the predicted error of the dosimetric endpoints. The dosimetric error was predicted using our previously developed geometry-dosimetry model. We tested our method in MAS-based rectum auto-contouring on 20 prostate cancer patients. The accuracy in the rectum sub-volume close to the planning tumor volume (PTV), which was found to be a dosimetric sensitive region of the rectum, was greatly improved. The mean absolute distance between the obtained contour and the physician-drawn contour in the rectum sub-volume 2 mm away from PTV was reduced from 3.96 mm to 3.36 mm on average for the 20 patients, with the maximum decrease found to be from 9.22 mm to 3.75 mm. We also compared the dosimetric endpoints predicted for the obtained contours with those predicted for the physician-drawn contours. Our method led to smaller dosimetric endpoint errors than the SIMPLE method in 15 patients, comparable errors in 2 patients, and slightly larger errors in 3 patients. These results indicated the efficacy of our method in terms of considering both geometric accuracy and dosimetric impact during label fusion. Our algorithm can be applied to different tumor sites and radiation treatments, given a specifically trained geometry-dosimetry model.""","""['Jina Chang', 'Zhen Tian', 'Weiguo Lu', 'Xuejun Gu', 'Mingli Chen', 'Steve B Jiang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Geometric and dosimetric evaluations of atlas-based segmentation methods of MR images in the head and neck region.', 'The dosimetric impact of deep learning-based auto-segmentation of organs at risk on nasopharyngeal and rectal cancer.', 'Evaluation and optimization of the parameters used in multiple-atlas-based segmentation of prostate cancers in radiation therapy.', 'Auto-segmentation of organs at risk for head and neck radiotherapy planning: From atlas-based to deep learning methods.', 'Metrics to evaluate the performance of auto-segmentation for radiation treatment planning: A critical review.']"""

Methods:   We administered semistructured interviews with 47 men diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma between 2012 and 2014. Telephone interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a systematic thematic approach.  Results:   Three profiles of patients emerged for choosing specialists: active (21.3%), partially active (53.2%), and passive (25.5%). Active patients conducted substantial research when choosing a diagnosing urologist and a treating specialist: they searched online, consulted other men with prostate cancer, and/or visited multiple specialists for opinions. Partially active patients took only 1 additional step to find a treating specialist on their own after receiving a referral from their diagnosing urologist. Passive patients relied exclusively on referrals from their primary care physicians (PCPs) and diagnosing urologists.  Conclusion:   The majority of patients relied on their PCPs for referrals to diagnosing urologists and on their diagnosing urologists to choose the treating specialist. Given these findings and the significance of specialist choice in determining treatment, it is important that PCPs recognize their indirect but potentially important effect on treatment choice when making referrals for prostate cancer.

Each transverse section was subdivided into 2 anterolateral and 2 posterolateral quadrants. Tumor extent was evaluated by a semi-quantitative point-count method. The index tumor (dominant nodule) was recorded as the maximal number of positive points of the most extensive tumor area from the quadrants and the predominant location was considered anterior (anterolateral quadrants), posterior (posterolateral quadrants), basal (quadrants in upper half of the prostate), apical (quadrants in lower half of the prostate), left (left quadrants) or right (right quadrants). Time to biochemical recurrence was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier product-limit analysis and prediction of shorter time to biochemical recurrence using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   Index tumors with predominant posterior location were significantly associated with higher total tumor extent, needle and radical prostatectomy Gleason score, positive lymph nodes and preoperative prostate-specific antigen. Index tumors with predominant basal location were significantly associated with higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen, pathological stage higher than pT2, extra-prostatic extension, and seminal vesicle invasion. Index tumors with predominant basal location were significantly associated with time to biochemical recurrence in Kaplan-Meier estimates and significantly predicted shorter time to biochemical recurrence on univariate analysis but not on multivariate analysis.

Qualitative feedback was elicited for each item to determine proper step placement, wording, and suggestions.  Results:   Panelist's responses were compiled and the inventory was edited through three iterations, after which 100% consensus was achieved. The initial inventory steps were decreased by 13% and a skip pattern was incorporated. The final RARP stepwise inventory was comprised of 13 critical steps with 52 sub-steps. There was no attrition throughout the Delphi process.  Conclusions:   Our Delphi study resulted in a comprehensive inventory of intraoperative RARP steps with excellent consensus.

Of the positive nodes, 51.6% were determined to reside outside of the radiation field and, of those, the most common sites were para-aortic (36.9%), proximal common iliac (17.8%), distal external iliac (17.8%), and nodes of Cloquet (17.8%).  Conclusions:   Based on 11C-acetate PET imaging in patients with PCa, the standard RTOG WPRT field may miss more than one-half of all positive lymph nodes. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for insufficient nodal coverage when using the standard RTOG WPRT field in patients with node-positive PCa. 11C-acetate PET imaging may be useful in defining target volumes for these patients.""","""['Chris McClinton', 'Maryam Niroumand', 'Sumit Sood', 'Veer Shah', 'Jacqueline Hill', 'Reginald W Dusing', 'Xinglei Shen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Distribution of prostate nodes: a PET/CT-derived anatomic atlas of prostate cancer patients before and after surgical treatment.', '11CAcetate positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging of prostate cancer lymph-node metastases correlated with histopathological findings after extended lymphadenectomy.', 'Patterns of Lymph Node Failure after Dose-escalated Radiotherapy: Implications for Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Coverage.', 'RTOG GU Radiation oncology specialists reach consensus on pelvic lymph node volumes for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'PET imaging for lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'The Distribution of Pelvic Nodal Metastases in Prostate Cancer Reveals Potential to Advance and Personalize Pelvic Radiotherapy.', 'Increased Frequency of Mesorectal and Perirectal LN Involvement in T4 Prostate Cancers.']"""

Methods and materials:   Twenty-six consecutive patients underwent intraoperative real-time corrections of their dose distributions at the end of their permanent seed interstitial procedures. After intraoperatively planned seeds were implanted and while the patient remained in the lithotomy position, a cone beam computed tomography scan was obtained to assess adequacy of the prescription dose coverage. The implanted seed positions were automatically segmented from the cone-beam images, fused onto a new set of acquired ultrasound images, reimported into the planning system, and recontoured. Dose distributions were recalculated based upon actual implanted seed coordinates and recontoured ultrasound images and were reviewed. If any dose deficiencies within the prostate target were identified, additional needles and seeds were added. Once an implant was deemed acceptable, the procedure was completed, and anesthesia was reversed.  Results:   When the intraoperative ultrasound-based quality assurance assessment was performed after seed placement, the median volume receiving 100% of the dose (V100) was 93% (range, 74% to 98%). Before seed correction, 23% (6/26) of cases were noted to have V100 <90%. Based on this intraoperative assessment and replanning, additional seeds were placed into dose-deficient regions within the target to improve target dose distributions. Postcorrection, the median V100 was 97% (range, 93% to 99%). Following intraoperative dose corrections, all implants achieved V100 >90%.  Conclusions:   In these patients, postimplantation evaluation during the actual prostate seed implant procedure was successfully applied to determine the need for additional seeds to correct dose deficiencies before anesthesia reversal. When applied, this approach should significantly reduce intraoperative errors and chances for suboptimal dose delivery during prostate brachytherapy.""","""['Michael J Zelefsky', 'Gilad N Cohen', 'Amandeep S Taggar', 'Marisa Kollmeier', 'Sean McBride', 'Gig Mageras', 'Marco Zaider']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Intraoperative and post-implant dosimetry in patients treated with permanent prostate implant brachytherapy.', 'Prostate seed implantation using 3D-computer assisted intraoperative planning vs. a standard look-up nomogram: Improved target conformality with reduction in urethral and rectal wall dose.', 'Phase II study of intraoperative dosimetry for prostate brachytherapy using registered ultrasound and fluoroscopy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

DWI provides visual as well as quantitative means of detecting tumor, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Recently higher b-values have been used to improve DWI's diagnostic performance. Purpose To determine the diagnostic performance of high b-value DWI at detecting prostate cancer and whether quantifying ADC improves accuracy. Material and Methods A comprehensive literature search of published and unpublished databases was performed. Eligible studies had histopathologically proven prostate cancer, DWI sequences using b-values ≥ 1000 s/mm2, less than ten patients, and data for creating a 2 × 2 table. Study quality was assessed with QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of diagnostic Accuracy Studies). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and tests for statistical heterogeneity and threshold effect performed. Results were plotted on a summary receiver operating characteristic curve (sROC) and the area under the curve (AUC) determined the diagnostic performance of high b-value DWI. Results Ten studies met eligibility criteria with 13 subsets of data available for analysis, including 522 patients. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.61) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.91-0.92), respectively, and the sROC AUC was 0.92. Subgroup analysis showed a statistically significant ( P = 0.03) improvement in accuracy when using tumor visual assessment rather than ADC. Conclusion High b-value DWI gives good diagnostic performance for prostate cancer detection and visual assessment of tumor diffusion is significantly more accurate than ROI measurements of ADC.""","""['Keith Craig Godley', 'Tom Joseph Syer', 'Andoni Paul Toms', 'Toby Oliver Smith', 'Glyn Johnson', 'Donnie Cameron', 'Paul Napier Malcolm']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Acta Radiol""","""['The diagnostic accuracy of high b-value diffusion- and T2-weighted imaging for the detection of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Diffusion-weighted imaging in the assessment of prostate cancer: Comparison of zoomed imaging and conventional technique.', 'Incremental value of high b value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at 3-T for prediction of extracapsular extension in patients with prostate cancer: preliminary experience.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Head-To-Head Comparison Between High- and Standard-b-Value DWI for Detecting Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Detection of High-Grade Prostate Cancer With a Super High B-value (4000 s/mm2) in Diffusion-Weighted Imaging Sequences by Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Feasibility of prostatectomy without prostate biopsy in the era of new imaging technology and minimally invasive techniques.', 'How clinical imaging can assess cancer biology.', 'Diffusion MRI of cancer: From low to high b-values.', 'The Use of Quantitative Imaging in Radiation Oncology: A Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) Perspective.']"""

Methods:   Bundang Prostatectomy Database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent RARP from 2007 to 2011 and had a positive surgical margin (PSM) on final pathology. Pathology findings were reviewed. BCR-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox univariable and multi-variable regression models were used to find the correlation between clinicopathologic factors and BCR.  Results:   Eight hundred and fifteen patients were included in the analysis: 118 (14.48%) had apical positive margin, 152 (18.65%) had a positive margin in another site, and 545 (66.87%) had negative surgical margins. In patients with only apical PSM, stratified by clinical stage, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significant difference in BCR-free survival between the groups (log rank P<0.001). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed maximal percentage of positive core is the strongest predictor of BCR (HR=3.131, P<0.001). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed PSM is one of the powerful predictor of postoperative BCR (HR=3.123, P<0.001).  Conclusions:   PSM after RALP is one of the powerful predictor of BCR and apical PSM is relatively less powerful predictor of BCR. Maximal percentage of positive core is the most powerful preoperative predictors of BCR.

Methods:   We created recorded vignettes of physician-patient discussions about prostate cancer screening and mammography, accompanied by illustrative slides, based on principles derived from preceding qualitative work and behavioral science literature. We conducted a randomized crossover study with repeated measures with 27 men aged 50 to 74 years and 35 women aged 40 to 49 years. All participants saw a video intervention and a more traditional, paper-based decision aid intervention in random order. At entry and after seeing each intervention, they were surveyed about screening intentions, perceptions of benefits and harm, and decisional conflict.  Results:   Changes in screening intentions were analyzed without regard to order of intervention after an initial analyses showed no evidence of an order effect.

Protein C is involved in hemostasis, inflammation and signal transduction, and has a protective effect on the endothelial barrier. In mice, administration of activated protein C reduced experimental metastasis. We assessed the association between protein C and mortality in patients with three types of cancer.  Methods:   The study population consisted of patients with advanced prostate, non-small cell lung or pancreatic cancer, who participated in the INPACT trial (NCT00312013). The trial evaluated the addition of nadroparin to chemotherapy in patients with advanced malignancy. Patients were divided into tertiles based on protein C at baseline. The association between protein C levels and mortality was evaluated with Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   We analysed 477 patients (protein C tertiles: <97, 97-121 and ≥121%). Mean age was 65±9years; 390 (82%) were male; 191 patients (40%) had prostate cancer, 161 (34%) had lung cancer, and 125 (26%) pancreatic cancer. During a median follow-up of 10.4months, 291 patients (61%) died. Median protein C level was 107% (IQR 92-129). In the lowest tertile, 75 patients per 100 patient-years died, as compared to 60 and 54 in the middle and high tertile, respectively. Lower levels of protein C were associated with increased mortality (in tertiles: HR for trend 1.18, 95%CI 1.02-1.36, adjusted for age, sex and nadroparin use; as a continuous variable: HR 1.004, 95%CI 1.00-1.008, p=0.07).  Conclusion:   Protein C seems inversely associated with mortality in patients with advanced prostate, lung and pancreatic cancer.

In this report, the associations of selected biomarkers with biochemical or clinical disease failure (BCDF) were prospectively evaluated in men with T1-T3 prostate cancer on a randomized hypofractionation trial.  Methods:   Biomarkers were analyzed in 263 of 303 men randomly assigned to standard vs moderate hypofractionation. Median follow-up was 65.9 months. Archival tissue was analyzed for Ki-67 (n = 231), MDM2 (n = 209), p16 (n = 195), Cox-2 (n = 126), p53 (n = 206), bcl2 (n = 223), bax (n = 210), and PKA (n = 160). The base model for multivariable Fine-Gray regression analysis included treatment assignment and risk groups. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Each biomarker was tested one at a time relative to the base model and selected for inclusion in multivariable analysis. Ki-67 (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19 to 4.48, P = .01) and bcl2&bax (HR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.08 to 4.46, P = .03) were statistically significantly related to higher BCDF and were independently statistically significant when considered jointly (Ki-67: HR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.12 to 4.58, P = .02; bcl2&bax: HR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.03 to 4.41, P = .04). At 2.5 years postradiotherapy, the C-index of Ki-67 was 73.2%, while for the base model was only 46.2%; Ki-67 was the most statistically significant when tested without bcl2&bax.  Conclusions:   In this prospective multiple biomarker analysis in men with prostate cancer treated with RT±ADT, both Ki-67 and bcl2&bax were independently related to early BCDF; however, Ki-67 alone is indicated to be the most clinically meaningful by C-index analysis and is universally available.""","""['Alan Pollack', 'Deukwoo Kwon', 'Gail Walker', 'Li Yan Khor', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Mark K Buyyounouski', 'Radka Stoyanova']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['MDM2 and Ki-67 predict for distant metastasis and mortality in men treated with radiotherapy and androgen deprivation for prostate cancer: RTOG 92-02.', 'Molecular markers of outcome after radiotherapy in patients with prostate carcinoma: Ki-67, bcl-2, bax, and bcl-x.', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'The role of treatment modality on the utility of predictive tissue biomarkers in clinical prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Meta-analysis of immunohistochemical prognostic markers in resected pancreatic cancer.', 'Prostate irradiation with focal dose escalation to the intraprostatic dominant nodule: a systematic review.', 'Ki67 Is an Independent Predictor of Recurrence in the Largest Randomized Trial of 3 Radiation Fractionation Schedules in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Tissue-based biomarkers in prostate cancer.']"""

This Annual Report highlights survival rates. Data were from the CDC- and NCI-funded population-based cancer registry programs and compiled by NAACCR. Trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex were estimated by joinpoint analysis and expressed as annual percent change. We used relative survival ratios and adjusted relative risk of death after a diagnosis of cancer (hazard ratios [HRs]) using Cox regression model to examine changes or differences in survival over time and by sociodemographic factors.  Results:   Overall cancer death rates from 2010 to 2014 decreased by 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.8 to -1.8) per year in men, by 1.4% (95% CI = -1.4 to -1.3) per year in women, and by 1.6% (95% CI = -2.0 to -1.3) per year in children. Death rates decreased for 11 of the 16 most common cancer types in men and for 13 of the 18 most common cancer types in women, including lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate, whereas death rates increased for liver (men and women), pancreas (men), brain (men), and uterine cancers. In contrast, overall incidence rates from 2009 to 2013 decreased by 2.3% (95% CI = -3.1 to -1.4) per year in men but stabilized in women. For several but not all cancer types, survival statistically significantly improved over time for both early and late-stage diseases. Between 1975 and 1977, and 2006 and 2012, for example, five-year relative survival for distant-stage disease statistically significantly increased from 18.7% (95% CI = 16.9% to 20.6%) to 33.6% (95% CI = 32.2% to 35.0%) for female breast cancer but not for liver cancer (from 1.1%, 95% CI = 0.3% to 2.9%, to 2.3%, 95% CI = 1.6% to 3.2%).

For example, the adjusted relative risk of death for all cancers combined was 33% (HR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.32 to 1.34) higher in non-Hispanic blacks and 51% (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.46 to 1.56) higher in non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native compared with non-Hispanic whites.  Conclusions:   Cancer death rates continue to decrease in the United States.

Nine previously established risk models were assessed for their ability to identify those most likely to develop or die from lung cancer. All models considered age and various aspects of smoking exposure (smoking status, smoking duration, cigarettes per day, pack-years smoked, time since smoking cessation) as risk predictors. In addition, some models considered factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, education, body mass index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, personal history of cancer, personal history of pneumonia, and family history of lung cancer.  Methods and findings:   Retrospective analyses were performed on 53,452 National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) participants (1,925 lung cancer cases and 884 lung cancer deaths) and 80,672 Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) ever-smoking participants (1,463 lung cancer cases and 915 lung cancer deaths). Six-year lung cancer incidence and mortality risk predictions were assessed for (1) calibration (graphically) by comparing the agreement between the predicted and the observed risks, (2) discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) between individuals with and without lung cancer (death), and (3) clinical usefulness (net benefit in decision curve analysis) by identifying risk thresholds at which applying risk-based eligibility would improve lung cancer screening efficacy. To further assess performance, risk model sensitivities and specificities in the PLCO were compared to those based on the NLST eligibility criteria. Calibration was satisfactory, but discrimination ranged widely (AUCs from 0.61 to 0.81). The models outperformed the NLST eligibility criteria over a substantial range of risk thresholds in decision curve analysis, with a higher sensitivity for all models and a slightly higher specificity for some models. The PLCOm2012, Bach, and Two-Stage Clonal Expansion incidence models had the best overall performance, with AUCs >0.68 in the NLST and >0.77 in the PLCO. These three models had the highest sensitivity and specificity for predicting 6-y lung cancer incidence in the PLCO chest radiography arm, with sensitivities >79.8% and specificities >62.3%. In contrast, the NLST eligibility criteria yielded a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of 62.2%. Limitations of this study include the lack of identification of optimal risk thresholds, as this requires additional information on the long-term benefits (e.g., life-years gained and mortality reduction) and harms (e.g., overdiagnosis) of risk-based screening strategies using these models. In addition, information on some predictor variables included in the risk prediction models was not available.  Conclusions:   Selection of individuals for lung cancer screening using individual risk is superior to selection criteria based on age and pack-years alone. The benefits, harms, and feasibility of implementing lung cancer screening policies based on risk prediction models should be assessed and compared with those of current recommendations.""","""['Kevin Ten Haaf', 'Jihyoun Jeon', 'Martin C Tammemägi', 'Summer S Han', 'Chung Yin Kong', 'Sylvia K Plevritis', 'Eric J Feuer', 'Harry J de Koning', 'Ewout W Steyerberg', 'Rafael Meza']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS Med""","""['Correction: Risk prediction models for selection of lung cancer screening candidates: A retrospective validation study.', 'Selecting high-risk individuals for lung cancer screening; the use of risk prediction models vs. simplified eligibility criteria.', 'OWL: an optimized and independently validated machine learning prediction model for lung cancer screening based on the UK Biobank, PLCO, and NLST populations.', 'Selection criteria for lung-cancer screening.', 'Development and Validation of Risk Models to Select Ever-Smokers for CT Lung Cancer Screening.', 'Evaluation of the Benefits and Harms of Lung Cancer Screening With Low-Dose Computed Tomography: A Collaborative Modeling Study for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Obesity and lung cancer-a narrative review.', 'The Journey for Lung Cancer Screening where we Stand Today.', 'Obesity, the Adipose Organ and Cancer in Humans: Association or Causation?', 'A systematic review of genetic ancestry as a risk factor for incidence of non-small cell lung cancer in the US.', 'Evaluation of the accuracy of the PLCOm2012 6-year lung cancer risk prediction model among smokers in the CARTaGENE population-based cohort.']"""

We investigated the prospective association of vasectomy with prostate cancer in a large European cohort, with a focus on high-grade and advanced-stage tumors, and death due to prostate cancer. Patients and Methods A total of 84,753 men from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), aged 35 to 79 years, provided information on vasectomy status (15% with vasectomy) at recruitment and were followed for incidence of prostate cancer and death. We estimated the association of vasectomy with prostate cancer risk overall, by tumor subtype, and for death due to prostate cancer, using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Results During an average follow-up of 15.4 years, 4,377 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, including 641 who had undergone a vasectomy. Vasectomy was not associated with prostate cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.15), and no evidence for heterogeneity in the association was observed by stage of disease or years since vasectomy. There was some evidence of heterogeneity by tumor grade ( P = .02), with an increased risk for low-intermediate grade (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.29) but not high-grade prostate cancer (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.07). Vasectomy was not associated with death due to prostate cancer (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.12).

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for subsequent 35 common cancer sites/types between 1990 and 2010 in patients with HCV infection in Sweden. Increased risks were recorded for six cancers. The highest SIR was seen for liver cancer (36.67; 95% CI: 33.20-40.40).

Methods and materials:   We selected 733 consecutive patients with localized PC treated with dose-escalation radiotherapy between 2001 and 2014. Eligibility criteria were radiation dose >72.0 Gy, no pelvic RT and minimum follow-up 24 months. 438 patients were treated with 3DCRT and 295 with IMRT. Acute and late urinary complications were assessed using the EORTC/RTOG and CTCAEs v3.0 definition. The Cox regression model was used to compare grade ≥2 urinary toxicity between both techniques. The median follow-up was 75 months (range 24-204).  Results:   The median isocenter radiation dose was 78.7 Gy for 3DCRT and 80.7 Gy for IMRT/IGRT (p < 0.001). The 5-year incidence of late grade ≥2 urinary toxicity was 6.4% for IMRT and 10.8% for 3DCRT [hazard ratio (HR) 0.575, p = 0.056]. The corresponding 5-year estimates of late grade ≥2 hematuria were 2% for IMRT and 5.3% for 3DCRT (HR 0.296, p = 0.024).

In the present study, we first observed a marked increase in Notch-4 expression in the PCa cell lines DU145, PC3 and LnCAP compared with the non-malignant prostate epithelial cell line RWPE1. Knocking down the expression of Notch-4 suppressed the viability and proliferation in the PCa cell lines DU145 and PC3. Also, further study showed that a decline in Notch-4 significantly promoted apoptosis in PC3 cells. Notch-4 silencing also resulted in decreased cell migration and invasion and affected the expression of EMT markers. We hypothesized that Notch-4 ablation suppresses the activity of NF-κB, so we used PMA to stimulate NF-κB p50 and p65 activation in PC3 cells.

Methods:   This IRB-approved study included 54 patients with PCa undergoing multi-parametric (mp) MRI before prostatectomy. Imaging analysis was performed on 54 tumours, 47 normal peripheral (PZ) and 48 normal transitional (TZ) zone based on histological-radiological correlation. Mp-MRI was scored via PI-RADS, and quantified by measuring radiomic features. Predictive model was developed using a novel support vector machine trained with: (i) radiomics, (ii) PI-RADS scores, (iii) radiomics and PI-RADS scores. Paired comparison was made via ROC analysis.  Results:   For PCa versus normal TZ, the model trained with radiomics had a significantly higher area under the ROC curve (Az) (0.955 [95% CI 0.923-0.976]) than PI-RADS (Az: 0.878 [0.834-0.914], p < 0.001).

The steroid abiraterone, the active form of the only CYP17A1 inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration, binds the catalytic heme iron, nonselectively impeding both reactions and ultimately causing undesirable corticosteroid imbalance. Some nonsteroidal inhibitors reportedly inhibit the lyase reaction more than the preceding hydroxylase reaction, which would be clinically advantageous, but the mechanism is not understood. Thus, the nonsteroidal inhibitors seviteronel and orteronel and the steroidal inhibitors abiraterone and galeterone were compared with respect to their binding modes and hydroxylase versus lyase inhibition. Binding studies and X-ray structures of CYP17A1 with nonsteroidal inhibitors reveal coordination to the heme iron like the steroidal inhibitors. (S)-seviteronel binds similarly to both observed CYP17A1 conformations. However, (S)-orteronel and (R)-orteronel bind to distinct CYP17A1 conformations that differ in a region implicated in ligand entry/exit and the presence of a peripheral ligand. To reconcile these binding modes with enzyme function, side-by-side enzymatic analysis was undertaken and revealed that neither the nonsteroidal seviteronel nor the (S)-orteronel inhibitors demonstrated significant lyase selectivity, but the less potent (R)-orteronel was 8- to 11-fold selective for lyase inhibition. While active-site iron coordination is consistent with competitive inhibition, conformational selection for binding of some inhibitors and the differential presence of a peripheral ligand molecule suggest the possibility of CYP17A1 functional modulation by features outside the active site.""","""['Elyse M Petrunak', 'Steven A Rogers', 'Jeffrey Aubé', 'Emily E Scott']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Drug Metab Dispos""","""['Stepwise binding of inhibitors to human cytochrome P450 17A1 and rapid kinetics of inhibition of androgen biosynthesis.', 'Multistep Binding of the Non-Steroidal Inhibitors Orteronel and Seviteronel to Human Cytochrome P450 17A1 and Relevance to Inhibition of Enzyme Activity.', 'Structures of cytochrome P450 17A1 with prostate cancer drugs abiraterone and TOK-001.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.', 'Structural insights into the function of steroidogenic cytochrome P450 17A1.', 'Non-steroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitors: Discovery and Assessment.', 'Recombinant Technologies Facilitate Drug Metabolism, Pharmacokinetics, and General Biomedical Research.', 'Exploring the Chemical Space of CYP17A1 Inhibitors Using Cheminformatics and Machine Learning.', 'Pyridine-containing substrate analogs are restricted from accessing the human cytochrome P450 8B1 active site by tryptophan 281.', 'Synthesis and Structure-Activity Relationships of Novel Non-Steroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitors as Potential Prostate Cancer Agents.']"""

In addition, clinical information is a reliable predictor of significant prostate cancer. We analyzed whether the negative predictive value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to rule out significant prostate cancer could be improved using clinical factors, especially prostate specific antigen density.  Materials and methods:   A total of 1,040 consecutive men with suspicion of prostate cancer underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging first, followed by transperineal systematic and magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test different clinical factors as predictors of significant prostate cancer and build nomograms. To simplify these nomograms for clinical use patients were stratified into 3 prostate specific antigen density groups, including group 1-less than 0.07, group 2-0.07 to 0.15 and group 3-greater than 0.15 ng/ml/ml. After stratification we calculated the negative predictive value of a PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) Likert score of less than 3. Significant prostate cancer was defined as a Gleason score of 3 + 4 or greater. High grade prostate cancer was defined as a Gleason score of 4 + 3 or greater.  Results:   Overall 451 men were diagnosed with significant prostate cancer, including 187 with a Gleason score of 4 + 3 or greater. On ROC curve analyses the predictive power of the developed nomogram for significant prostate cancer showed a higher AUC than that of PI-RADS alone (0.79 vs 0.75, p <0.001). The negative predictive value of harboring significant prostate cancer increased in men with unsuspicious magnetic resonance imaging from 79% up to 89% when prostate specific antigen density was 0.15 ng/ml/ml or less. In the repeat biopsy setting the negative predictive value of significant prostate cancer increased from 83% to 93%. The negative predictive value to harbor high grade prostate cancer increased from 92% up to 98% in the entire cohort.

Most recently, an isothermal enzymatic nucleic acid amplification method termed rolling circle transcription (RCT), which achieves a large-scale synthesis of RNA nanostructures, has emerged as one of fascinating techniques for RNAi-based therapies. Herein, we proposed a newly designed RCT method for synthesis of polymeric siRNA nanoflower, referred to 'RCT and annealing-generated polymeric siRNA (RAPSI)': (1) Amplification of the antisense strand of siRNA via RCT process and (2) annealing of chimeric sense strand containing 3'-terminal DNA nucleotides that provide enzyme cleavage sites. To verify its potentials in RNAi-based cancer therapy, the newly designed RAPSI nanoflower was further complexed with glycol chitosan (GC) derivatives, and systemically delivered to PC-3 xenograft tumors. The resultant RAPSI nanoparticles exhibited the improved particle stability against polyanion competition or nuclease attack. When the RAPSI nanoparticles reached to the cytoplasmic region, active mono siRNA was liberated and significantly down-regulated the expression of target VEGF gene in PC-3 cells. Excellent tumor-homing efficacy and anti-tumor effects of the RAPSI nanoparticles were further demonstrated. Overall, the proposed RCT-based polymeric siRNA nanoflower formulation can provide a new platform technology that allows further functional modifications via an advanced annealing method for systemic cancer RNAi therapy.""","""['Jae Hyeop Lee', 'Sook Hee Ku', 'Min Ju Kim', 'So Jin Lee', 'Hyun Cheol Kim', 'Kwangmeyung Kim', 'Sun Hwa Kim', 'Ick Chan Kwon']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['Co-delivery of VEGF and Bcl-2 dual-targeted siRNA polymer using a single nanoparticle for synergistic anti-cancer effects in vivo.', 'Selective delivery of PLXDC1 small interfering RNA to endothelial cells for anti-angiogenesis tumor therapy using CD44-targeted chitosan nanoparticles for epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Cancer-targeted MDR-1 siRNA delivery using self-cross-linked glycol chitosan nanoparticles to overcome drug resistance.', 'Chitosan-based nanoparticles for mucosal delivery of RNAi therapeutics.', 'Favorable biodistribution, specific targeting and conditional endosomal escape of RNA nanoparticles in cancer therapy.', 'Aptamer functionalized nucleic acid nano drug for targeted synergistic therapy for colon cancer.', 'Preparation of a miR-155-activating nucleic acid nanoflower to study the molecular mechanism of miR-155 in inflammation.', 'Hierarchical self-uncloaking CRISPR-Cas13a-customized RNA nanococoons for spatial-controlled genome editing and precise cancer therapy.', 'The dynamic, motile and deformative properties of RNA nanoparticles facilitate the third milestone of drug development.', 'Multimeric RNAs for efficient RNA-based therapeutics and vaccines.']"""

Male Balb/c nude mice were divided into three groups: the non-castration, castration, and castration + OPG groups. PC-3M-luc-C6 was injected into the left ventricle of the mice. Recombinant OPG was injected intravenously twice weekly in the castration + OPG group. In-vivo imaging system (IVIS®) determined that the prevalence and photon counts of bone metastasis in the castration group were significantly higher than that in the non-castration and castration + OPG groups. The mean number of RANKL-positive osteoblasts and the mean serum RANKL level in the castration group were significantly higher than those in the non-castration group. RANKL-enhanced activation of osteoclasts was attenuated in the castration + OPG group.

This editorial discusses how cancer metastasis may be better perceived and controlled. Based on big-data analyses, a collection of 150 important pro-metastatic genes was studied. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets to re-analyze the effect of some previously reported metastatic genes-e.g., JAM2, PPARGC1A, SIK2, and TRAF6-on overall survival of patients with renal and liver cancers, we found that these genes are actually protective factors for patients with cancer. The role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in single-cell metastasis has been well-documented. However, in metastasis caused by cancer cell clusters, EMT may not be necessary. A novel role of epithelial marker E-cadherin, as a sensitizer for chemoresistant prostate cancer cells by inhibiting Notch signaling, has been found. This editorial also discusses the obstacles for developing anti-metastatic drugs, including the lack of high-throughput technologies for identifying metastasis inhibitors, less application of animal models in the pre-clinical evaluation of the leading compounds, and the need for adjustments in clinical trial design to better reflect the anti-metastatic efficacy of new drugs.

Women are known to act as the healthcare gatekeeper for the family. As such, African-American (AA) women could facilitate the informed decision-making process by providing prostate cancer and screening information to AA men. However, little is known about AA women's knowledge regarding prostate cancer and screening. This report describes the findings of a non-experimental cross-sectional study conducted using a convenience sample of 200 AA women. Data was collected using the knowledge subscale of the Eastland prostate cancer survey. Data was analyzed using JMP 13 statistical software developed by Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS) Institute. The overall mean knowledge score was 6.59 (47.1%). Knowledge was significantly associated with personal or family history of cancer (p = .02), family history of prostate cancer (p = .002), and the age of the respondents (p = .004) with those of older age (51 years and above) scoring higher on the knowledge scale.

This phase I dose escalation study of UV1 evaluated safety, immune response, effects on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and preliminary clinical outcome. Twenty-two patients with newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-naïve PC (mPC) were enrolled; all had started androgen deprivation therapy and had no visceral metastases. Bone metastases were present in 17 (77%) patients and 16 (73%) patients had affected lymph nodes. Three dose levels of UV1 were given as intradermal injections combined with GM-CSF (Leukine®). Twenty-one patients in the intention-to-treat population (95%) received conformal radiotherapy. Adverse events reported were predominantly grade 1, most frequently injection site pruritus (86.4%). Serious adverse events considered possibly related to UV1 and/or GM-CSF included anaphylactic reaction in two patients and thrombocytopenia in one patient. Immune responses against UV1 peptides were confirmed in 18/21 evaluable patients (85.7%), PSA declined to <0.5 ng/mL in 14 (64%) patients and in ten patients (45%) no evidence of persisting tumour was seen on MRI in the prostatic gland. At the end of the nine-month reporting period for the study, 17 patients had clinically stable disease. Treatment with UV1 and GM-CSF gave few adverse events and induced specific immune responses in a large proportion of patients unselected for HLA type.

The objective of this study was to explore the interaction between curcumin and PGK1, an oncogene in the FOXD3/miR-143 axis, in prostate cancer therapy.  Methods:   MiRNA microarray analysis was used to identify miRNAs upregulated by curcumin treatment. MiR-143 was dramatically upregulated by curcumin. Cells were treated with antimiR-143 in combination to curcumin, followed by examining cell viability and migration. Bioinformatics analysis was used to investigate target genes of miR-143. The interaction between miR-143 and PGK1 was evaluated with dual-luciferase assay. Since FOXD3 is important in the regulation of miR-143, we explored whether curcumin regulated FOXD3 expression. FOXD3 was also ectopically overexpressed to investigate its effects on curcumin's regulation of miR-143.  Results:   Curcumin treatment significantly upregulated miR-143 and decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration. Those effects were attenuated by anti-miR-143 transfection. Both miR-143 overexpression and curcumin treatment inhibited PGK1 expression and ectopic expression of PGK1 antagonized curcumin's antitumor effects. FOXD3 was upregulated by miR-143. Ectopic expression of FOXD3 synergized with curcumin in upregulating miR-143 expression.  Conclusion:   Curcumin inhibits prostate cancer by upregulating miR-143.

In this study, we employed four natural bioactive compounds (curcumin, resveratrol, melatonin, and silibinin) and studied their role in redox control and ability to promote apoptosis in androgen sensitive and insensitive prostate cancer cells. Here is shown that curcumin and resveratrol promote ROS production and induce apoptosis in LNCaP and PC-3. An increase in reactive species is a trigger event in curcumin-induced apoptosis and a consequence of resveratrol effects on other pathways within these cells. Moreover, here we demonstrated that these four compounds affect differently one of the main intracellular redox regulator, the thioredoxin system. Exposure to curcumin and resveratrol promoted TRX1 oxidation and altered its subcellular location. Furthermore, resveratrol diminished TRX1 levels in PC-3 cells and increased the expression of its inhibitor TXNIP. Conversly, melatonin and silibinin only worked as cytostatic agents, reducing ROS levels and showing preventive effects against TRX oxidation. All together, this work explores the effect of compounds currently tested as chemo-preventive agents in prostate cancer therapy, on the TRX1 redox state and function. Our work shows the importance that the TRX system might have within the differences found in their mechanisms of action.

Such imaging provides prognostic and predictive information relevant to management, e.g. by quantifying active tumour mass using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). As these techniques require only pharmacologically inactive doses, age and potential frailty are generally not important. However, this may be different for therapy involving radionuclides because the radiation can impact normal bodily function (e.g. myelosuppression). Since the introduction of Iodine-131 as a targeted therapy in thyroid cancer, several radiopharmaceuticals have been widely used. These include antibodies and peptides targeting specific epitopes on cancer cells. Among therapeutic bone seeking agents, radium-223 (223Ra) stands out as it results in survival gains in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and symptomatic bone metastases. The therapeutic use of radiopharmaceuticals in elderly cancer patients specifically has received little attention. In elderly prostate cancer patients, there may be advantages in radionuclides' ease of use and relative lack of toxicity compared with cytotoxic and cytostatic drugs. When using radionuclide therapies, close coordination between oncology and nuclear medicine is needed to ensure safe and effective use. Bone marrow reserve has to be considered. As most radiopharmaceuticals are cleared renally, dose adjustment may be required in the elderly. However, compared with younger patients there is less, if any, concern about adverse long-term radiation effects such as radiation-induced second cancers. Issues regarding the safety of medical staff, care givers and the wider environment can be managed by current precautions.""","""['John O Prior', 'Silke Gillessen', 'Manfred Wirth', 'William Dale', 'Matti Aapro', 'Wim J G Oyen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Radionuclide Therapy for Bone Metastases: Utility of Scintigraphy and PET Imaging for Treatment Planning.', 'Bone-targeting radiopharmaceuticals including radium-223.', 'Integrating bone targeting radiopharmaceuticals into the management of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'Radionuclide cancer therapy.', 'Radiation dosimetry for radionuclide therapy in a nonmyeloablative strategy.', 'A National Multicenter Study on overall survival in elderly metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with Radium-223.']"""

Discussion:   PPI is recognised as an important component of contemporary health research. PPI is becoming a common and essential requirement for high quality research projects and yet literature exploring or reporting the involvement and influence of PPI is sparse. Consideration is given to the national PPI landscape that has shaped public involvement in health research.

Antibody immobilization onto the SiNPs by the SBP-ProG could rapidly be achieved without any chemical treatment. The immunosensor was fabricated through bonding of a partially gold-deposited cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) (top substrate) and gold patterned interdigitated array COC electrode (bottom substrate). To prevent electrode fouling, human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) was immobilized onto the ceiling inside the microchannel, instead of the bottom electrode. Alkaline phosphatase (AP)-labeled anti-hIgG was allowed to immunoreact with hIgG on the ceiling, followed by addition of an enzyme to generate an oxidative peak current. A three-fold increase in current was observed from the immunosensor without any electrode fouling compared with a control with the protein functionalized electrode. Also, the SiNPs facilely coated with AP-anti-hIgG via the SBP-ProG could increase the electrochemical signal up to 20% larger than that of the AP-anti-hIgG alone.

They all compared ADT-treated cancer patients to non-treated patients or non-cancer subjects. Our aim was to evaluate whether CV risk differs by type of ADT.  Methods:   Through nationwide population-based claims reimbursement database linked to hospital discharge database, we identified adult men with prostate cancer who initiated ADT (gonadotrophin releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist or antagonist, antiandrogen [AA], combined androgen blockade [CAB]) or had orchiectomy (OT) between 1st July, 2010, and the 31st December, 2011, and followed them up to 31st December, 2013. The main analysis followed an 'on-treatment' approach that censored all patients at the time of first therapeutic modification; it used Cox regression analysis to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for hospitalisations for ischaemic events (myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke, whichever came first), adjusted on age, baseline co-morbidities and taking into account death as a competing risk.  Results:   Among the 35,118 new ADT users, 71% received GnRH agonist (reference group), 12% CAB, 13% AA, 3.6% GnRH antagonist and 0.6% had OT. CAB was associated with an increased risk (adjusted HR [95% confidence interval {CI}], 1.6 [1.3-2.0]) and AA with a decreased risk (adjusted HR [95% CI], 0.6 [0.4-0.9]) of ischaemic events when compared to GnRH agonist. No significant association was found with GnRH antagonist (adjusted HR [95% CI], 1.2 (0.7-2.1)).  Conclusion:   CV risk appeared different across ADT modalities. The probability of a clinically meaningful difference when comparing GnRH antagonists to agonists appears rather low. In a context where better overall and cancer specific survival without worsening quality of life is a challenge for clinicians, a potential heterogeneity in CV morbidity becomes crucial when choosing an ADT.""","""['Lucie-Marie Scailteux', 'Sébastien Vincendeau', 'Frédéric Balusson', 'Christophe Leclercq', 'André Happe', 'Béranger Le Nautout', 'Elisabeth Polard', 'Emmanuel Nowak', 'Emmanuel Oger']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Response to letter - Androgen deprivation therapy and cardiovascular risk: No meaningful difference between GnRH antagonist and agonists.', 'Re: Androgen deprivation therapy and cardiovascular risk: No meaningful difference between GnRH antagonist and agonists.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapies and Changes in Comorbidity: A Comparison of Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone Agonists and Antiandrogen Monotherapy as Primary Therapy in Men with High-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Association of androgen deprivation therapy with thromboembolic events in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Diabetes and cardiovascular disease during androgen deprivation therapy: observational study of veterans with prostate cancer.', 'Quantifying observational evidence for risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Update on cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles of hormonal agents used in managing advanced prostate cancer.', 'Adverse cardiovascular effect following gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist versus GnRH agonist for prostate cancer treatment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'UPDATE - Canadian Urological Association guideline on androgen deprivation therapy: Adverse events and management strategies.', 'Assessment and Mitigation of Cardiovascular Risk for Prostate Cancer Patients: A Review of the Evidence.', 'Cardiovascular risk of gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist versus agonist in men with prostate cancer: an observational study in Taiwan.', 'Cardiovascular Safety of Degarelix Versus Leuprolide in Patients With Prostate Cancer: The Primary Results of the PRONOUNCE Randomized Trial.']"""

In this study, the somatic mutation profiles of prostate cancer were downloaded from the TCGA database and used as the source nodes of the random walk with restart algorithm (RWRA) for generating smoothed mutation profiles in the STRING network. The smoothed mutation profiles were selected as the input matrix of the Graph-regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (GNMF) for classifying patients into distinct molecular subtypes. The results were associated with most of the clinical and pathological outcomes. In addition, some bioinformatics analyses were performed for the robust subtyping, and good results were obtained.

This study was undertaken to ascertain the androgen uptake kinetics, functional, and clinical relevance of de novo expression of the steroid hormone transporter OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3). Experiments testing the cellular uptake of androgens suggest that testosterone is an excellent substrate of OATP1B3 (Km = 23.2 μmol/L; Vmax = 321.6 pmol/mg/minute), and cells expressing a doxycycline-inducible SLCO1B3 construct had greater uptake of a clinically relevant concentration of 3H-testosterone (50 nmol/L; 1.6-fold, P = 0.0027). When compared with Slco1b2 (-/-) mice, Slco1b2 (-/-)/hSLCO1B3 knockins had greater hepatic uptake (15% greater AUC, P = 0.0040) and lower plasma exposure to 3H-testosterone (17% lower AUC, P = 0.0030). Of 82 transporters genes, SLCO1B3 is the second-most differentially expressed transporter in CRPC cell lines (116-fold vs. androgen-sensitive cells), with a differentially spliced cancer-type ct-SLCO1B3 making up the majority of SLCO1B3 expression. Overexpression of SLCO1B3 in androgen-responsive cells results in 1.5- to 2-fold greater testosterone uptake, whereas siRNA knockdown of SLCO1B3 in CRPC cells did not change intracellular testosterone concentration. Primary human prostate tumors express SLCO1B3 to a greater extent than ct-SLCO1B3 (26% of total SLCO1B3 expression vs. 0.08%), suggesting that androgen uptake in these tumor cells also is greater. Non-liver tumors do not differentially express SLCO1B3.Implications: This study suggests that de novo OATP1B3 expression in prostate cancer drives greater androgen uptake and is consistent with previous observations that greater OATP1B3 activity results in the development of androgen deprivation therapy resistance and shorter overall survival.

We hypothesized that, due to its steroidal structure, the CYP17A inhibitor abiraterone may undergo transport by SLCO-encoded transporters and that SLCO gene variation may influence intracellular abiraterone levels and outcomes.Experimental Design: Steroid and abiraterone levels were measured in serum and tissue from 58 men with localized prostate cancer in a clinical trial of LHRH agonist plus abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for 24 weeks prior to prostatectomy. Germline DNA was genotyped for 13 SNPs in six SLCO genes.Results: Abiraterone levels spanned a broad range (serum median 28 ng/mL, 108 nmol/L; tissue median 77 ng/mL, 271 nmol/L) and were correlated (r = 0.355, P = 0.001). Levels correlated positively with steroids upstream of CYP17A (pregnenolone, progesterone), and inversely with steroids downstream of CYP17A (DHEA, AED, testosterone). Serum PSA and tumor volumes were higher in men with undetectable versus detectable tissue abiraterone at prostatectomy (median 0.10 vs. 0.03 ng/dL, P = 0.02; 1.28 vs. 0.44 cc, P = 0.09, respectively). SNPs in SLCO2B1 associated with significant differences in tissue abiraterone (rs1789693, P = 0.0008; rs12422149, P = 0.03) and higher rates of minimal residual disease (tumor volume < 0.5 cc; rs1789693, 67% vs. 27%, P = 0.009; rs1077858, 46% vs. 0%, P = 0.03). LNCaP cells expressing SLCO2B1 showed two- to fourfold higher abiraterone levels compared with vector controls (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Intraprostatic abiraterone levels and genetic variation in SLCO genes are associated with pathologic responses in high-risk localized prostate cancer.

A few studies reported good correlations between signals from tumor tissues and CTCs or cfDNAs, making it possible to detect cancers using CTCs and cfDNAs. However, the detection cannot tell which cancer types the person has. To meet these challenges, we developed an algorithm, eTumorType, to identify cancer types based on copy number variations (CNVs) of the cancer founding clone. eTumorType integrates cancer hallmark concepts and a few computational techniques such as stochastic gradient boosting, voting, centroid, and leading patterns. eTumorType has been trained and validated on a large dataset including 18 common cancer types and 5327 tumor samples. eTumorType produced high accuracies (0.86-0.96) and high recall rates (0.79-0.92) for predicting colon, brain, prostate, and kidney cancers.

To determine the clinical variables that would be able to optimise the test's diagnostic yield.  Material and methods:   A retrospective study of PET-CTs with 18F-fluorocholine performed on 61 patients with prostate cancer who had undergone treatment with curative intent and met the criteria for biochemical recurrence. The results of the PET-CT were categorised into positive or negative and were validated using pre-established criteria. The relationship between the result of the PET-CT and the initial PSA nadir, PSA trigger, rising PSA velocity (PSAva) and PSA doubling time (PSAdt). The relationship between the metastatic sites on the PET-CT and the remaining variables was analysed.  Results:   There was a 34.4% detection rate of the disease. The initial PSA, PSA nadir, PSA trigger and PSAva showed statistically significant differences according to the result of the PET-CT. The best discriminatory cut-off point between a positive or negative PET-CT for PSA trigger and PSAva was 3.5ng/ml and 0.25ng/ml/month respectively. The PSAdt was significantly lower in patients with remote disease compared to patients with localised disease (5.1 vs 16.8 months, P=.01). The probability that the PET-CT would detect remote disease vs localised disease was 3.2 times higher if the PSAdt was under 6 months (80% vs 20%, OR: 3.2, P=.02). In the multivariate analysis, only the initial PSA and not having undergone radical prostatectomy were demonstrated as independent predictive factors of a positive PET-CT result.  Conclusions:   The PET-CT with 18F-FCH can detect disease in a high percentage of patients with biochemical recurrence and provides information on its anatomical location.

Despite its up-regulation in prostate cancer (PCa), biological significance and clinicopathological features of CYP1B1 are still elusive. Here, we show that overexpression or hyperactivation of CYP1B1 stimulated proliferative, migratory and invasive potential of non-tumorigenic PCa cells. Attenuation of CYP1B1 with its specific small hairpin (sh) RNAs greatly reduced proliferation through apoptotic cell death and impaired migration and invasion in PCa cells. Intratumoral injection of CYP1B1 shRNA attenuated growth of pre-existing tumors. The antitumor effect of CYP1B1 shRNA was also observed in prostate tumor xenograft mouse models. Among the genes altered by CYP1B1 knockdown, reduction of caspase-1 (CASP1) activity attenuated the antitumor effect of CYP1B1 inhibition. Indeed, CYP1B1 regulates CASP1 expression or activity.

However, mechanisms underlying the BE remain elusive. We report here that etoposide and ultraviolet (UV) exposure stimulate the production of microvesicles (MVs) in DU145 prostate cancer cells. MVs isolated from UV-treated DU145 and A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells as well as etoposide-treated DU145 cells induced phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) at serine 1981 (indicative of ATM activation) and phosphorylation of histone H2AX at serine 139 (γH2AX) in naïve DU145 cells. Importantly, neutralization of MVs derived from UV-treated cells with annexin V significantly reduced the MV-associated BE activities. Etoposide and UV are known to induce DDR primarily through the ATM and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) pathways, respectively. In this regard, MV is likely a common source for the DNA damage-induced bystander effect. However, pre-treatment of DU145 naïve cells with an ATM (KU55933) inhibitor does not affect the BE elicited by MVs isolated from etoposide-treated cells, indicating that the BE is induced upstream of ATM actions.

Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is reported to be overexpressed in several cancers including PCa, and this has led to clinical cancer treatments that utilize various FASN inhibitors such as the anti-obesity drug, Orlistat. However, pharmacological limitations have impeded the progress in cancer treatments expected thus far with FASN inhibition. In this study, we investigated a novel therapeutic combination to enhance the toxic potential of Orlistat in three different PCa cell-lines (DU145, PC3, and LNCaP). We show that Orlistat and 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) (AMP-activated protein kinase [AMPK] activator) co-treatment induces significant downregulation of two key fatty acid synthesis regulatory proteins (FASN, Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 [SREBP-1c]) as compared to control and Orlistat alone. Orlistat and AICAR co-treatment induced a significant decrease in cell viability and proliferation, and a significant increase in apoptosis in all three PCa cell-lines. Apoptosis induction was preceded by a marked increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production followed by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and activation of pro-apoptotic caspases. We also observed a significant decrease in migration potential and VEGF expression in Orlistat and AICAR co-treated samples in all three PCa cell-lines. Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) negatively affected some of the enhanced anti-cancer effects observed with Orlistat treatment. We conclude that AICAR co-treatment potentiates the anti-proliferative effects of Orlistat at a low dose (100 µM), and this combination has the potential to be a viable and effective therapeutic option in PCa treatment.

Hence, to determine the implication of AR and AP-1 in promoting the transition of prostate cancer to the androgen-independent state, we used AR-positive LNCaP and AR-negative PC-3 cells as an in vitro model system. The effect of dihydrotestosterone or anti-androgen bicalutamide on the cell proliferation and viability was assessed by MTT assay. Expression studies on AR, marker genes-PSA, TMPRSS2, and different AP-1 factors were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and expressions of AR and Fra-1 proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Dihydrotestosterone induced the cell proliferation in LNCaP with no effect on PC-3 cells. Bicalutamide decreased the viability of both LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Dihydrotestosterone induced the expression of AR, PSA, c-Jun, and Fra-1 in LNCaP cells, and it was c-Jun and c-Fos in case of PC-3 cells, while bicalutamide decreased their expression.

To determine the beneficial antitumoral effects of metformin on prostate cancer progression/aggressiveness and the relative contribution of high-fat diet (HFD; independently of obesity), we used HFD-fed immunosuppressed mice inoculated with PC3 cells (which exhibited partial resistance to diet-induced obesity) compared with low-fat diet (LFD)-fed control mice. Moreover, gene expression analysis was performed on cancer-associated genes in the xenografted tumors, and the antitumorigenic role of metformin on tumoral (PC3/22Rv1/LNCaP) and normal (RWPE1) prostate cells was evaluated. The results demonstrate that HFD is associated with enhanced prostate cancer growth irrespective of body weight gain and endocrine metabolic dysregulations and that metformin can reduce prostate cancer growth under LFD but more prominently under HFD, acting through the modulation of several tumoral-associated processes (e.g., cell cycle, apoptosis, and/or necrosis). Moreover, the actions observed in vivo could be mediated by the modulation of the local expression of GH/IGF1 axis components. Finally, it was demonstrated that metformin had disparate effects on proliferation, migration, and prostate-specific antigen secretion from different cell lines. Altogether, these data reveal that metformin inhibits prostate cancer growth under LFD and, specially, under HFD conditions through multiple metabolic/tumoral signaling pathways.Implications: The current study linking dietary influence on metformin-regulated signaling pathways and antitumoral response provides new and critical insight on environment-host interactions in cancer and therapy.

The primary objectives were to establish individual readers' diagnostic performance and the overall interpretation (2/3 reader concordance) compared with standard-of-truth data (histopathology or clinical follow-up) and to evaluate interreader reproducibility. Secondary objectives included comparison to the expert reader and assessment of intrareader reproducibility. Methods:18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT images (n = 121) and corresponding standard-of-truth data were collected from 110 subjects at Emory University using a single-time-point static acquisition starting 5 min after injection of approximately 370 MBq of 18F-fluciclovine. Three readers were trained using standardized interpretation methodology and subsequently evaluated the images in a blinded manner. Analyses were conducted at the lesion, region (prostate, including bed and seminal vesicle, or extraprostatic, including all lymph nodes, bone, or soft-tissue metastasis), and subject level. Results: Lesion-level overall positive predictive value was 70.5%. The readers' positive predictive value and negative predictive value were broadly consistent with each other and with the onsite read. Sensitivity was highest for readers 1 and 2 (68.5% and 63.9%, respectively) whereas specificity was highest for reader 3 (83.6%). Overall, prostate-level sensitivity was high (91.4%), but specificity was moderate (48.7%). Interreader agreement was 94.7%, 74.4%, and 70.3% for the lesion, prostate, and extraprostatic levels, respectively, with associated Fleiss' κ-values of 0.54, 0.50, and 0.57. Intrareader agreement was 97.8%, 96.9%, and 99.1% at the lesion level; 100%, 100%, and 91.7% in the prostate region; and 83.3%, 75.0%, and 83.3% in the extraprostatic region for readers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Concordance between the BIE and the onsite reader exceeded 75% for each reader at the lesion, region, and subject levels. Conclusion: Specific training in the use of standardized interpretation methodology for assessment of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT images enables naïve readers to achieve acceptable diagnostic performance and reproducibility when staging recurrent prostate cancer.""","""['Matthew P Miller', 'Lale Kostakoglu', 'Daniel Pryma', 'Jian Qin Yu', 'Albert Chau', 'Eric Perlman', 'Bonnie Clarke', 'Donald Rosen', 'Penelope Ward']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Prospective evaluation of fluciclovine (18F) PET-CT and MRI in detection of recurrent prostate cancer in non-prostatectomy patients.', 'Recurrent prostate cancer detection with anti-3-(18)FFACBC PET/CT: comparison with CT.', 'Diagnostic performance of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT for regional lymph node metastases in patients with primary prostate cancer: a multicenter phase II clinical trial.', 'Fluorine-18-Labeled Fluciclovine PET/CT in Primary and Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer Management.', 'Extraprostatic Uptake of 18F-Fluciclovine: Differentiation of Nonprostatic Neoplasms From Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Initial Institutional Experience with 18F-Fluciclovine PET-CT in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT on salvage radiotherapy plans for men with recurrence of prostate cancer postradical prostatectomy.', 'The Diagnostic Role of 18F-Choline, 18F-Fluciclovine and 18F-PSMA PET/CT in the Detection of Prostate Cancer With Biochemical Recurrence: A Meta-Analysis.', 'The Role of 18FFluciclovine PET/CT in the Characterization of High-Risk Primary Prostate Cancer: Comparison with 11CCholine PET/CT and Histopathological Analysis.', 'Detection of Recurrent Prostate Cancer With 18F-Fluciclovine PET/MRI.']"""

Material and methods:   We reviewed consecutive patients who had in 2008 a single urinary PCA3 test using the Gen-Probe® assay before a first prostate biopsy for a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) between 3 and 20ng/mL and/or a suspicious digital rectal examination. PCA3 performances were analyzed in 2008 and then in 2013 after taking into account the results of repeat biopsies.  Results:   At initial biopsy in 2008, among the 125 patients study cohort, prostate cancer was diagnosed in 47 patients (37.6%). Abnormal digital rectal exam, PSA density, prostate volume and PCA3 score were significantly associated with prostate cancer diagnosis. PCA3 area under the curve of the receiver operating curve was 0.67 [95%CI: 0.57-0.76] with an optimal threshold of PCA3 in this sample of 24 units. During the 5-year follow-up, among the 78 patients with a negative prostate biopsy in 2008, 23 (29.5%) had a repeat prostate biopsy of whom 14 were diagnosed with prostate cancer. PCA3 score measured in 2008 was associated with prostate cancer diagnosis (P=0.002). All 9 patients with a negative repeat prostate biopsy had a PCA3 score below the cut-off while this was the case in only 2 patients among the 14 with a positive repeat prostate biopsy.

Objective:   To assess cancer-specific mortality (CSM) after LT versus NLT in mPCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2013), 13 692 mPCa patients were treated with LT (radical prostatectomy [RP] or radiation therapy [RT]) or NLT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable competing risk regression analyses (MVA CRR) tested CSM after propensity score matching (PSM) in two analyses, (1) NLT versus LT and (2) RP versus RT, and were complemented with interaction, sensitivity, unmeasured confounder, and landmark analyses.  Results and limitations:   Of 13 692 mPCa patients, 474 received LT: 313 underwent RP and 161 RT. In MVA CRR, after PSM, LT (n=474) results in lower CSM (subhazard ratio [SHR] 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-0.50) versus NLT (n=1896). In MVA CRR after PSM, RP (n=161) results in lower CSM (SHR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.99) versus RT (n=161). Invariably, lowest CSM rates were recorded for Gleason ≤7, ≤cT3, and M1a substage. Interaction and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of results, and landmark analyses rejected the bias favouring LT. A strong unmeasured confounder (HR=5), affecting 30% of NLT patients, could obliterate LT benefit. Data were retrospective.  Conclusions:   In mPCa, LT results in lower mortality relative to NLT. Within LT, lower mortality is recorded after RP than RT. Patients with most favourable grade, local stage, and metastatic substage derive most benefit from LT. They also derive most benefit from RP, when LT types are compared (RP vs RT). It is important to consider study limitations until ongoing clinical trials confirm the proposed benefits.

Objective:   To identify molecular features predictive of patient response to 5-ARIs.  Design, setting, and participants:   Nkx3.1 mutant mice, a model of early-stage PCa, were treated with the 5-ARI finasteride, and histopathological and molecular analyses were performed. Cross-species computational analyses were used to compare expression profiles for treated mice with those of patients who had received 5-ARIs before prostatectomy.  Intervention:   Finasteride administered to Nkx3.1 mutant mice. 5-ARI-treated patient specimens obtained retrospectively.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Endpoints in mice included histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular profiling. GraphPad Prism software, R-studio, and Matlab were used for statistical and data analyses.  Results and limitations:   Finasteride treatment of Nkx3.1 mutant mice resulted in a significant reduction in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), as evident from histopathological and expression profiling analyses. Cross-species computational analysis comparing finasteride-treated mice with two independent 5-ARI-treated patient cohorts showed that reduced NKX3.1 expression is predictive of response to 5-ARI. A limitation of the study is that these retrospective human cohorts have relatively few patients with limited clinical outcome data. Future prospective clinical trials are needed to validate whether stratifying patients on the basis of NKX3.1 expression improves the benefit of 5-ARIs during active surveillance.  Conclusions:   This co-clinical study implicates NKX3.1 status as a predictor of response to 5-ARIs, and suggests that molecular features, including NKX3.1 expression, may help to identify PCa patients most likely to benefit from 5-ARIs during active surveillance.

A propensity score was developed based on age, prebiopsy serum prostate-specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage, prostate volume, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation status, year of surgery, and pretreatment potency. Outcomes were biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) using the American Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and Phoenix criteria, 12-month continence (strictly pad free), and sexual function (potency sufficient for sexual intercourse). After propensity score matching, BPFS was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and functional outcomes using chi-square tests.  Results:   In all, 897 men were identified (731 whole gland and 166 partial). Postmatching, 166 pairs of men were analyzed (mean follow-up 31 months). The 2/5-year BPFS rate was 87.2%/76.4% for whole-gland vs 80.7%/70.0% for partial ablation using Phoenix (p = 0.26) and 72.3%/69.6% for whole-gland vs 82.1%/75.0% for partial ablation using ASTRO criteria (p = 0.10).

This study compared planned versus daily cone-beam CT (CBCT)-based spatial bladder dose distributions, for prostate cancer patients receiving local prostate treatment (local treatment) versus prostate including pelvic lymph node irradiation (pelvic treatment).  Material and methods:   Twenty-seven patients (N = 15 local treatment; N = 12 pelvic treatment) were treated using daily image-guided RT (1.8 Gy@43-45 fx), adhering to a full bladder/empty rectum protocol. For each patient, 9-10 CBCTs were registered to the planning CT, using the clinically applied translations. The urinary bladder was manually segmented on each CBCT, 3 mm inner shells were generated, and semi and quadrant sectors were created using axial/coronal cuts. Planned and delivered DVH metrics were compared across patients and between the two groups of treatment (t-test, p < .05; Holm-Bonferroni correction). Associations between bladder volume variations and the dose-volume histograms (DVH) of the bladder and its sectors were evaluated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, rs).  Results:   Bladder volumes varied considerably during RT (coefficient of variation: 16-58%). The population-averaged planned and delivered DVH metrics were not significantly different at any dose level. Larger treatment bladder volumes resulted in increased absolute volume of the posterior/inferior bladder sector receiving intermediate-high doses, in both groups. The superior bladder sector received less dose with larger bladder volumes for local treatments (rs ± SD: -0.47 ± 0.32), but larger doses for pelvic treatments (rs ± SD: 0.74 ± 0.24).  Conclusions:   Substantial bladder volume changes during the treatment course occurred even though patients were treated under a full bladder/daily image-guided protocol. Larger bladder volumes resulted in less bladder wall spared at the posterior-inferior sector, regardless the treatment received. Contrary, larger bladder volumes meant larger delivered doses to the superior bladder sector for pelvic RT but smaller doses for local treatments.""","""['Oscar Casares-Magaz', 'Vitali Moiseenko', 'Austin Hopper', 'Niclas Johan Pettersson', 'Maria Thor', 'Rick Knopp', 'Joseph O Deasy', 'Ludvig Paul Muren', 'John Einck']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Dosimetric and volumetric changes in the rectum and bladder in patients receiving CBCT-guided prostate IMRT: analysis based on daily CBCT dose calculation.', 'Testicular doses in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'Advantages and robustness of partial VMAT with prone position for neoadjuvant rectal cancer evaluated by CBCT-based offline adaptive radiotherapy.', 'The dosimetric underpinning of bladder filling criteria for prostate image-guided volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Predictors for late genitourinary toxicity in men receiving radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer using planned and accumulated dose.', 'Bladder volume reproducibility after water consumption in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radiotherapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A case-control study using motion-inclusive spatial dose-volume metrics to account for genito-urinary toxicity following high-precision radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Background:   The standard bowel preparation protocol for prostate biopsy has not been established.  Design:   A retrospective study in a single centre.  Methods:   From January 2013-December 2015, the clinical records of 1,130 patients who underwent prostate biopsy were, respectively, reviewed. All the patients received metronidazole prophylaxis before biopsy. The patients were divided into three groups according to the bowel preparation methods: patients in Group A (n = 402) received only soapy enema; patients in Group B (n = 413) received polyethylene glycol; while patients in Group C (n = 315) received polyethylene glycol plus povidone-iodine enema. Infectious complications were classified as fever (>37.5°C), urinary tract infection and sepsis. The postoperative adverse events were also observed.  Results:   The overall postbiopsy infectious complications were observed in 48 (4.25%) patients of all the cases, including 23 (5.72%) cases in Group A, 20 (4.84%) cases in Group B and five patients (1.59%) in Group C. There was significant difference among the groups (p = .018). In detail, these infectious complications included 22 (1.95%) cases of fever and 26 (2.30%) cases of urinary tract infection. No sepsis was observed among the total patients. The incidence of adverse events was 14.43% (58/402) occurred in Group A, 25.91% (107/413) in Group B and 26.67% (84/315) in Group C. The difference was statistically significant.  Conclusions:   Our study confirmed that combined preparation regimens of polyethylene glycol with povidone-iodine enema could significantly reduce the postbiopsy infection rate. Conventional soapy enema is associated with less adverse events.  Relevance to clinical practice:   Findings of this study provide useful evidence-based information for healthcare professionals.

Blocking cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 elicits T cell activation, proliferation and anti-tumor response, but can also trigger immune-related adverse events. Among immune-related endocrinopathies, hypophysitis represents the most frequent, with an incidence up to 17% in patients treated with ipilimumab.  Design and methods:   We report nine cases of ipilimumab-induced hypophysitis in a cohort of 273 patients treated with ipilimumab between 2006 and 2015, as part of clinical trials or after its marketing. Thyroid function tests were scheduled at screening and during follow up (every 21 days) in all patients. Cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol (for females) or testosterone (for males), prolactin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 were measured only in case of clinical suspicion.  Results:   The incidence of hypophysitis was 3.3%.

Methods:   48 patients with suspected recurrent PCa underwent PET/CT after injection of the 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA ligand followed by integrated PET/MRI. Image analysis was performed by nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists with respect to the detection of lymph node metastases, bone metastases and local recurrence of the tumour. Image quality was evaluated visually based on a three-point ordinal scale.  Results:   From 48 patients initially examined, 25 were finally eligible for qualitative and quantitative image evaluation. In 14 patients, neither PET/CT nor PET/MRI found tumour lesions, and 9 patients were excluded from image analysis due to a pronounced extinction artifact around the urinary bladder (halo). In comparison to 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA-PET/CT, 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA-PET/MRI identified 14 vs. 9 local recurrences in the prostate bed and 23 vs. 20 PET-positive lymph nodes, and 4 vs. 4 PET-positive bone lesions, respectively. While the improved detection of suspicious lymph nodes was primarily attributable to the PET component, the advantageous detection of tumour recurrences in the prostate bed was chiefly referable to the superior soft-tissue contrast of the MR component of integrated PET/MRI.

Morusin is an anti-cancer drug isolated from the root bark of Morus alba. Morusin induces apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells by reducing STAT3 activity. In this study, we examined whether morusin induces autophagy and also examined the effects of autophagy on the morusin-induced apoptosis. Morusin induces LC3-II accumulation and ULK1 activation in HeLa cells. In addition, we found that induction of ULK1 Ser317 phosphorylation and reduction of ULK1 Ser757 phosphorylation occurred simultaneously during morusin-induced autophagy. Consistently, morusin induces autophagy by activation of AMPK and inhibition of mTOR activity. Next, we investigated the role of autophagy in morusin-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of autophagy by treating cells with the 3-methyladenine (3-MA) autophagic inhibitor induces high levels of morusin-mediated apoptosis, while treatment of cells with morusin alone induces moderate levels of apoptosis. Cell survival was greatly reduced when cells were treated with morusin and 3-MA.

Predictive factors for bone metastasis are required to improve patient outcomes. The study aimed to analyze the factors associated with bone metastases in newly diagnosed patients with PCa. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a retrospective study of 80 patients newly diagnosed with PCa by pathological examination between January 2012 and December 2014. Bone metastases were diagnosed by positron emission computed tomography. Clinical data, serological laboratory results, and pathological examination results were collected. RESULTS Among the 80 patients, 45 (56%) had bone metastases. Age, serum alkaline phosphatase, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, PCa tissue Gleason score, androgen receptor (AR) expression, and Ki-67 expression were higher in patients with bone metastasis compared with those without (all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that PSA (OR: 1.005; 95%CI: 1.001-1.010; P=0.016), Gleason score (OR: 4.095; 95%CI: 1.592-10.529; P=0.003), and AR expression (OR: 14.023; 95%CI: 3.531-55.6981; P=0.005) were independently associated with bone metastases.

Recently, accumlating evidences have showed that many RNA transcripts could function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) by competitively binding common microRNAs. In this study, we demonstrated that a lncRNA, Small Nucleolar RNA Host Gene 1 (SNHG1), as a ceRNA for miR-199a-3p, played a critical role in prostate cancer cell proliferation. We found that SNHG1 was aberrantly up-regulated in prostate carcinoma tissues; while, miR-199a-3p was abnormally down-regulated. The level of SNHG1 in prostate cancer was significantly negatively correlated with that of miR-199a-3p. Our data indicated that SNHG1 could interact with miR-199a-3p and inhibit the activity of miR-199a-3p in prostate cancer cells. In addition, miR-199a-3p could target the 3' UTR of CDK7 and suppress CDK7 expression. More importantly, SNHG1 increased CDK7 expression by competitively binding miR-199a-3p, and then promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in prostate cancer. Taken together, these findings elucidated a novel mechanism of prostate cancer progression.

Decision making based on European Randomised Study of Screening for PC (ERSPC) risk-calculator (RC) parameters may overcome prostate-specific antigen (PSA) limitations.  Objective:   We added pre-biopsy mpMRI to ERSPC-RC parameters and developed risk models (RMs) to predict individual sPC risk for biopsy-naïve men and men after previous biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively analyzed clinical parameters of 1159 men who underwent mpMRI prior to MRI/transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy between 2012 and 2015.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariate regression analyses were used to determine significant sPC predictors for RM development. The prediction performance was compared with ERSPC-RCs, RCs refitted on our cohort, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v1.0, and ERSPC-RC plus PI-RADSv1.0 using receiver-operating characteristics (ROCs). Discrimination and calibration of the RM, as well as net decision and reduction curve analyses were evaluated based on resampling methods.  Results and limitations:   PSA, prostate volume, digital-rectal examination, and PI-RADS were significant sPC predictors and included in the RMs together with age. The ROC area under the curve of the RM for biopsy-naïve men was comparable with ERSPC-RC3 plus PI-RADSv1.0 (0.83 vs 0.84) but larger compared with ERSPC-RC3 (0.81), refitted RC3 (0.80), and PI-RADS (0.76). For postbiopsy men, the novel RM's discrimination (0.81) was higher, compared with PI-RADS (0.78), ERSPC-RC4 (0.66), refitted RC4 (0.76), and ERSPC-RC4 plus PI-RADSv1.0 (0.78). Both RM benefits exceeded those of ERSPC-RCs and PI-RADS in the decision regarding which patient to receive biopsy and enabled the highest reduction rate of unnecessary biopsies. Limitations include a monocentric design and a lack of PI-RADSv2.0.  Conclusions:   The novel RMs, incorporating clinical parameters and PI-RADS, performed significantly better compared with RMs without PI-RADS and provided measurable benefit in making the decision to biopsy men at a suspicion of PC.

Accurately stratifying PCSM risk can improve therapy decisions.  Objective:   Validate the 22 gene Decipher genomic classifier (GC) to predict PCSM in men with adverse pathologic features after RP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men with adverse pathologic features: pT3, pN1, positive margins, or Gleason score >7 who underwent RP in 1987-2010 at Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, and Durham Veteran's Affairs Hospital. We also analyzed subgroups at high risk (prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/ml, RP Gleason score 8-10, or stage >pT3b), or very high risk of PCSM (biochemical recurrence in<2 yr [BCR2], or men who developed metastasis after RP [MET]).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression evaluated the association of GC with PCSM within 10 yr of RP (PCSM10), adjusted for the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical Score (CAPRA-S). GC performance was evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curves.  Results and limitations:   Five hundred and sixty-one men (112 with PCSM10), median follow-up 13.0 yr (patients without PCSM10). For high GC score (> 0.6) versus low-intermediate (≤ 0.6), the odds ratio for PCSM10 adjusted for CAPRA-S was 3.91 (95% confidence interval: 2.43-6.29), with AUC=0.77, an increase of 0.04 compared with CAPRA-S. Subgroup odds ratios were 3.96, 3.06, and 1.95 for high risk, BCR2, or MET, respectively (all p<0.05), with AUCs 0.64-0.72. GC stratified cumulative PCSM10 incidence from 2.8% to 30%. Combined use of case-control and cohort data is a potential limitation.  Conclusions:   In a large cohort with the longest follow-up to date, Decipher GC demonstrated clinically important prediction of PCSM at 10 yr, independent of CAPRA-S, in men with adverse pathologic features, BCR2, or MET after RP.

Aim:   To introduce the concept of failure to cure (FTC) in the context of PPI to more accurately gauge postoperative outcomes after PPI.  Methods:   Consecutive patients from our sexual function registry who underwent PPI from January 2011 to December 2013 were analyzed. Demographics, previous treatment of erectile dysfunction, comorbidities, social history, postoperative problems (POPs), and surgical outcomes were tabulated. Patients completed the International Index of Erection Function (IIEF) and the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction questionnaires. We defined a complication, according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, as any deviation from the ideal postoperative course that is not inherent in the procedure and does not constitute an FTC. FTC was defined as a POP that was not a complication. The χ2 tests, t-tests, or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used.  Outcomes:   Patient-reported and objective outcomes after PPI.  Results:   Our enrollment consisted of 185 patients, and we contacted 124 (67%). Of these, 16 (12.9%) had a POP requiring reoperation. Eight patients developed surgical complications (three infections, four erosions, and one chronic pain). Eight patients had FTC (four malpositions and four malfunctions). Factors that correlated with POPs were previous PPI, body mass index higher than 30 kg/m2, and previous treatment with intracorporal injections (P < .05 for all comparisons). Patients who had POPs scored significantly lower on the IIEF erectile function and intercourse satisfaction domains (P < .05 for the two comparisons), but not on the orgasmic function, sexual desire, and overall satisfaction domains (P > .05 for all comparisons).  Clinical implications:   POPs after PPI surgery can be more accurately categorized using the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications to more clearly distinguish surgical complications from FTC.  Strengths and limitations:   Limitations of our study include its retrospective approach. Our series included a large proportion of patients treated for prostate cancer, which limits the generalizability of our findings. We also had a relatively short median follow-up time of 27 months.  Conclusions:   Patient-reported outcome assessments can vary greatly from what physicians determine to be successful PPI. An assessment of POPs encompasses more than just complication rates; it also reflects FTC. Even when POPs occur, patients can still derive satisfaction if they are correctively managed. Factors that possibly predispose to POPs include previous PPI surgery, body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2, and history of intracorporal injections. Pineda M, Burnett AL.

We examined whether the DNA-PK activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) was related to biochemical (prostate-specific antigen: PSA) relapse and radiation toxicity in prostate cancer patients who have received radiotherapy. A total of 69 patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate participated in this study. Peripheral blood was collected 2 years or later after radiotherapy and centrifuged, then DNA-PK activity was measured by a filter binding assay. The high DNA-PK activity group had a significantly higher PSA relapse-free survival rate than the low DNA-PK activity group. The 10-year PSA relapse-free survival was 87.0% in the high DNA-PK activity group, whereas it was 52.7% in the low DNA-PK activity group. Multivariate analysis showed the Gleason score and the level of DNA-PK activity were significant predictors of PSA relapse after radiotherapy. In addition, the low DNA-PK activity group tended to have a higher incidence of Grade 1-2 urinary toxicity than the high DNA-PK activity group. Prostate cancer patients with low DNA-PK activity had a higher rate of PSA relapse and a higher incidence of urinary toxicity.

We investigated the associations of 46 GWAS-identified SNPs, circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), and prostate cancer (3,811 cases, 511 of whom died from the disease, compared with 2,980 controls-from 5 cohort studies that recruited participants over several periods beginning in the 1980s). We used logistic regression models with data from the National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) to evaluate interactions on the multiplicative and additive scales. After allowing for multiple testing, none of the SNPs examined was significantly associated with 25(OH)D concentration, and the SNP-prostate cancer associations did not differ by these concentrations.

The current dosing strategy of cabazitaxel is based on body surface area (BSA). Body surface area is known as a poor predictor for total systemic exposure to drugs, since it does not take into account variability in activity of metabolising enzymes, necessary for clearance of drugs. As exposure to cabazitaxel is related to treatment response, it is essential to develop a better individualised dosing strategy.  Methods:   Ten patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who received cabazitaxel dosed on BSA as a part of routine palliative care, were enrolled in this study. Midazolam was administered as phenotyping probe for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A (CYP3A). The relationship between midazolam and cabazitaxel clearance was investigated using non-linear mixed effects modelling.  Results:   The clearance of Midazolam highly correlated with cabazitaxel clearance (R=0.74). Midazolam clearance significantly (P<0.004) explained the majority (∼60%) of the inter-individual variability in cabazitaxel clearance in the studied population.

Biomarkers capable to predict biochemical PCa recurrence (BCR) after RP would significantly improve preoperative risk stratification and treatment decisions. MicroRNA (miRNA) deregulation has recently emerged as an important phenomenon in tumor development and progression, however, the mechanisms remain largely unstudied. In the present study, based on microarray profiling of DNA methylation in 9 pairs of PCa and noncancerous prostate tissues (NPT), host genes of miR-155-5p, miR-152-3p, miR-137, miR-31-5p, and miR-642a, -b were analyzed for promoter methylation in 129 PCa, 35 NPT, and 17 benign prostatic hyperplasia samples (BPH) and compared to the expression of mature miRNAs and their selected targets (DNMT1, KDM1A, and KDM5B). The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset was utilized for validation. Methylation of mir-155, mir-152, and mir-137 host genes was PCa-specific, and downregulation of miR-155-5p significantly correlated with promoter methylation. Higher KDM5B expression was observed in samples with methylated mir-155 or mir-137 promoters, whereas upregulation of KDM1A and DNMT1 was associated with mir-155 and mir-152 methylation status, respectively. Promoter methylation of mir-155, mir-152, and mir-31 was predictive of BCR-free survival in various Cox models and increased the prognostic value of clinicopathologic factors. In conclusion, methylated mir-155, mir-152, mir-137, and mir-31 host genes are promising diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers of PCa.

We aim to determine whether this trend continued from 2004 to 2013, and to determine whether there were changes in utilization for various types of radiation.  Methods:   We conducted this retrospective study using the National Cancer Database. We identified 706 877 patients with sufficient treatment information diagnosed with stage IIA prostate cancer between 2004 and 2013. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the yearly trend in radiation therapy utilization.  Results:   There was a significant decline in the use of radiation therapy from 2004 to 2013, from 54.4% in 2004 to 34.5% in 2013 compared with all the other treatments. The use of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) declined from 27.1% in 2004 to 25.0% in 2013, brachytherapy declined from 19.7% in 2004 to 6.1% in 2013, and combination therapy declined from 6.8% in 2004 to 2.6% in 2013. However, when considering only patients receiving radiation treatments, the use of EBRT steadily increased from 50.6% in 2004 to 74.0% in 2013, whereas the use of brachytherapy declined from 36.7% in 2004 to 18.2% in 2013. Finally, although the proportion of patients receiving combination radiation therapy initially declined from 2004 to 2009 (from 12.7 to 8.3%), there was little change in utilization from 2009 to 2013 (8.3 to 8.5%).  Conclusions:   There has been a significant decline in the use of overall radiation therapy, as well as for each radiotherapy modality, for the treatment of prostate cancer since 2004.

Methods:   We analyzed data retrieved from Taiwan National Health Insurance Database between January 2000 and December 2012. Patients diagnosed with gout during the study period with no history of prostate cancer and who had never used allopurinol were selected.

Conclusions:   Previous findings suggest that African American men may experience more distress than Caucasian men when facing typical prostate cancer side effects. Traditional masculine role norms and negative perceptions of ""disease disclosure"" in the African American community could be contributing to the distress reported by some in this study.

However, the impact of these techniques on the risk of developing incisional hernia has yet to be fully evaluated. The aim of this study was to compare the risk of incisional hernia after open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (MIRP).  Materials and methods:   From the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden, all men who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer between 2004 and 2013 were identified. These data were linked with the National Patient Register to determine comorbidity and subsequent diagnosis of incisional hernia or surgery for incisional hernia. The endpoint was diagnosis of or surgery for incisional hernia. Multivariate proportional Cox hazard regression analyses were performed to analyze risk factors.  Results:   In total, 19,743 men underwent radical prostatectomy during the study period. The cumulative incidence of incisional hernia was 1.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.7%] and 2.3% (CI 1.9-2.7%) 5 years after ORP and MIRP, respectively (p < .05). For men undergoing ORP, age above the median was associated with increased risk of incisional hernia (p < .001). For men undergoing MIRP, age above the median, prostate volume above the median and lymph-node dissection were associated with increased risk of incisional hernia (p < .05).

Numerous microRNAs that are critical for metastasis are dysregulated in metastatic prostate cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. We perform an integrative analysis of transcription factor (TF) and microRNA expression profiles and computationally identify three master TFs, AR, HOXC6 and NKX2-2, which induce the aberrant metastatic microRNA expression in a mutually exclusive fashion. Experimental validations confirm that the three TFs co-dysregulate a large number of metastasis-associated microRNAs. Moreover, their overexpression substantially enhances cell motility and is consistently associated with a poor clinical outcome. Finally, the mutually exclusive overexpression between AR, HOXC6 and NKX2-2 is preserved across various tissues and cancers, suggesting that mutual exclusivity may represent an intrinsic characteristic of driver TFs during tumorigenesis.""","""['Mengzhu Xue', 'Haiyue Liu', 'Liwen Zhang', 'Hongyuan Chang', 'Yuwei Liu', 'Shaowei Du', 'Yingqun Yang', 'Peng Wang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['Transcription factor and microRNA regulation in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA and Transcription Factor Gene Regulatory Network Analysis Reveals Key Regulatory Elements Associated with Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'TCF7 is suppressed by the androgen receptor via microRNA-1-mediated downregulation and is involved in the development of resistance to androgen deprivation in prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs as Regulators of Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'Androgen receptor and miR-206 regulation in prostate cancer.', 'Loss of MAGEC3 Expression Is Associated with Prognosis in Advanced Ovarian Cancers.', 'Interaction between Non-Coding RNAs and Androgen Receptor with an Especial Focus on Prostate Cancer.', 'miR-6086 inhibits ovarian cancer angiogenesis by downregulating the OC2/VEGFA/EGFL6 axis.', 'AAV-Anti-miR-214 Prevents Collapse of the Femoral Head in Osteonecrosis by Regulating Osteoblast and Osteoclast Activities.', 'A Multidimensional Characterization of E3\xa0Ubiquitin Ligase and Substrate Interaction Network.']"""

Most cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed during the early asymptomatic period, in which case the prognosis is very good. Therapies differ widely in their efficacies and toxicities, and this is an important consideration when it comes to deciding which treatment is optimal for a particular patient. One treatment method for early stage prostate cancer is stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). We present the first results obtained using this modality at our institution.  Patients and methods:   A total of 261 patients with low or intermediate risk prostate cancer were treated with SBRT between August 2010 and July 2012. Patients received a total dose of 36.25 Gy in five fractions of 7.25 Gy every other day. The toxicity of the treatment was evaluated according to RTOG criteria. For assessment of quality of life, patients filled out a modified EPIC questionnaire (Expanded Prostate Composite index).  Results:   Overall survival (OS) in this study was 93.1%. Biochemical relapse free survival (bRFS) was 97.7%. As expected, OS and bRFS were worse in the group of patients with an intermediate risk of recurrence. Acute and chronic urinary and gastrointestinal RTOG toxicity was very low. Quality of life after treatment, as determined using the EPIC questionnaire, was slightly reduced immediately after treatment but returned to baseline or even improved during long term follow-up.  Conclusion:   SBRT is an effective therapeutic modality for early prostate cancer and has acceptable rates of acute and low late toxicity.Key words: prostate cancer - stereotactic body radiotherapy - quality of life The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study.

Current predictions indicate that in the near future prostate cancer will become the most frequent cancer among males in Slovakia.  Aims:   The aims of the study presented in this paper were to analyse trends in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in Slovakia and compare these trends with those in other countries and regions of the world, predict epidemiological indicators of prostate cancer in Slovakia, and provide relevant and updated data for the purposes of further analyses and evaluation of the impacts of interventions.  Material and methods:   National data were analysed for the period 1968-2009. Trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality were extracted using the joinpoint regression model and are presented with correspoding 95% CI and p values. Predictions of incidence and prevalence were calculated for the years 2014 and 2015, resp.  Results:   A significant increase in standardized incidence was observed in Slovakia (from 14.5/100,000 in 1980 to 49.0/100,000 in 2009), representing as much as a 6.7% annual percentage change in recent years. The mortality values showed a slower rate of increase, from 9.4/100,000 in 1980 to 13.3/100,000 in 2009, while national mortality of prostate cancer decreased in recent years. These facts have made prostate cancer the most prevalent malignant tumor in males in Slovakia.  Conclusion:   Unlike in other countries, in Slovakia, no peak in prostate cancer incidence with a subsequent drop is observed. Mortality values reveal a favorable trend in the current national data.Key words: prostate cancer - incidence - mortality - prevalence - clinical stages The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of interest concerning drugs, products, or services used in the study.

The development of new therapeutic agents that can suppress the transcriptional activities of AR splice variants has been anticipated as the next generation treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   High-throughput screening of AR-V7 signaling inhibitors was performed using an AR-V7 reporter system. The effects of a glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) inhibitor, LY-2090314, on endogenous AR-V7 signaling were evaluated in an AR-V7-positive cell line, JDCaP-hr, by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The relationship between AR-V7 signaling and β-catenin signaling was assessed using RNA interference. The effect of LY-2090314 on cell growth in various prostate cancer cell lines was also evaluated.  Results:   We identified GSK3 inhibitors as transcriptional suppressors of AR-V7 using a high-throughput screen with an AR-V7 reporter system. LY-2090314 suppressed the reporter activity and endogenous AR-V7 activity in JDCaP-hr cells. Because silencing of β-catenin partly rescued the suppression, it was evident that the suppression was mediated, at least partially, via the activation of β-catenin signaling. AR-V7 signaling and β-catenin signaling reciprocally regulate each other in JDCaP-hr cells, and therefore, GSK3 inhibition can repress AR-V7 transcriptional activity by accumulating intracellular β-catenin. Notably, LY-2090314 selectively inhibited the growth of AR-V7-positive prostate cancer cells in vitro.  Conclusions:   Our findings demonstrate the potential of GSK3 inhibitors in treating advanced prostate cancer driven by AR splice variants. In vivo evaluation of AR splice variant-positive prostate cancer models will help illustrate the overall significance of GSK3 inhibitors in treating prostate cancer.""","""['Daisuke Nakata', 'Ryokichi Koyama', 'Kazuhide Nakayama', 'Satoshi Kitazawa', 'Tatsuya Watanabe', 'Takahito Hara']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Growth Inhibition by Testosterone in an Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-Driven Prostate Cancer Model.', 'The RNA helicase DDX39B and its paralog DDX39A regulate androgen receptor splice variant AR-V7 generation.', 'Prognostic Value of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in the Treatment of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer with Next generation Androgen Receptor Signal Inhibition: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Choosing Kinase Inhibitors for Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancers and targeted therapies.', 'Androgen receptor variant-driven prostate cancer II: advances in laboratory investigations.', 'The Role of Alcohol-Induced Golgi Fragmentation for Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The nanoparticles were characterized for particle size, zeta potential, moisture content, physical state of the drugs, physical stability, and entrapment efficiency. An UPLC method was developed and validated for the simultaneous analysis of curcumin and resveratrol. Alginate nanoformulation was tested for in vitro efficacy on DU145 prostate cancer cells. The particle size of the nanosuspension and freeze-dried nanoparticles was found to be 12.53 ± 1.06 and 60.23 ± 15 nm, respectively. Both DSC and powder XRD studies indicated that curcumin as well as resveratrol were present in a non-crystalline state, in the nanoparticles.

Methods:   This study included 72 prostate cancer patients who underwent MRI-ultrasound fusion-targeted biopsy at the initiation of active surveillance, had a visible MRI lesion in the region of tumor on biopsy, and underwent 3T baseline and follow-up MRI examinations separated by at least one year. Thirty of the patients also underwent an additional MRI-ultrasound fusion-targeted biopsy after the follow-up MRI. Whole-lesion ADC metrics and lesion volumes were computed from 3D whole-lesion volumes-of-interest placed on lesions on the baseline and follow-up ADC maps. The percent change in lesion volume on the ADC map between the serial examinations was computed. Statistical analysis included unpaired t tests, ROC analysis, and Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Baseline mean ADC, ADC0-10th-percentile, ADC10-25th-percentile, and ADC25-50th-percentile were all significantly lower in lesions exhibiting ≥50% growth on the ADC map compared with remaining lesions (all P ≤ 0.007), with strongest difference between lesions with and without ≥50% growth observed for ADC0-10th-percentile (585 ± 308 vs. 911 ± 336; P = 0.001). ADC0-10th-percentile achieved highest performance for predicting ≥50% growth (AUC = 0.754). Mean percent change in tumor volume on the ADC map was 62.3% ± 26.9% in patients with GS ≥ 3 + 4 on follow-up biopsy compared with 3.6% ± 64.6% in remaining patients (P = 0.050).

Prostate specific antigen (PSA), the only biomarker widely used in prostate cancer, is suffering from low specificity. Exosomes offer new perspectives in the discovery of blood-based biomarkers. Here we present a proof-of principle study for a proteomics-based identification pipeline, implementing existing data sources, to exemplarily identify exosome-based biomarker candidates in prostate cancer.Exosomes from malignant PC3 and benign PNT1A cells and from FBS-containing medium were isolated using sequential ultracentrifugation. Exosome and control samples were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. Proteomic data is available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003651. We developed a scoring scheme to rank 64 proteins exclusively found in PC3 exosomes, integrating data from four public databases and published mass spectrometry data sets. Among the top candidates, we focused on the tight junction protein claudin 3. Retests under serum-free conditions using immunoblotting and immunogold labeling confirmed the presence of claudin 3 on PC3 exosomes. Claudin 3 levels were determined in the blood plasma of patients with localized (n = 58; 42 with Gleason score 6-7, 16 with Gleason score ≥8) and metastatic prostate cancer (n = 11) compared with patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 15) and healthy individuals (n = 15) using ELISA, without prior laborious exosome isolation. ANOVA showed different CLDN3 plasma levels in these groups (p = 0.004). CLDN3 levels were higher in patients with Gleason ≥8 tumors compared with patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (p = 0.012) and Gleason 6-7 tumors (p = 0.029). In patients with localized tumors CLDN3 levels predicted a Gleason score ≥ 8 (AUC = 0.705; p = 0.016) and did not correlate with serum PSA.By using the described workflow claudin 3 was identified and validated as a potential blood-based biomarker in prostate cancer.

However, its role in prostate cancer is largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the biological role and underlying mechanism of GAS5 on proliferation in prostate cancer. The results demonstrate that GAS5 expression is significantly decreased in prostate cancer cells compared with prostate epithelial cells. Ectopic expression of GAS5 inhibited cell proliferation and induced a cell-cycle arrest in G0-G1 phase, whereas GAS5 knockdown promoted the G1-S phase transition. Subsequent analysis demonstrated that P27Kip1, a known regulator of cell cycle, was positively regulated by GAS5 and upregulation of GAS5 increased its promoter activity. E2F1, an important transcription factor, was shown to bind directly to and activate the P27Kip1 promoter. In addition, GAS5 interacted with E2F1 and enhanced the binding of E2F1 to the P27Kip1 promoter. Collectively, these findings determine that GAS5 functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer development and progression via targeting P27Kip1Implications: This study reveals a molecular pathway involving lncRNA GAS5/E2F1/P27Kip1 which regulates cell proliferation and could be a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer.

Results:   IL-6 increased the proliferation of LNCaP cells with maximal induction at 50 ng/mL. The AR-SRC-1interaction was enhanced by IL-6, with maximal induction at the concentration of 50 ng/mL (P<0.05). IL-6 decreased the AR-SMRT interaction and a marked reduction was detected at 50 ng/mL (P<0.05).  Conclusions:   IL-6 enhances LNCaP cells proliferation, which suggests that IL-6 might cause AR-positive prostate cancer growth through activation of the AR.

Local recurrence was proved by prostate biopsies, once biochemical relapse was diagnosed and imaging assessment performed.  Results:   The average age of a patient at the time of diagnosis was 66 years (62-71 years). The median nadir prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum concentration after brachytherapy was 1.29ng/mL (0.6-2.1ng/mL), obtained after a median of 12 months (7-21 months).

Objectives:   To determine the diagnostic accuracy of IsoPSA in identifying the presence or absence of PCa and the presence of high-grade disease in a contemporary biopsy cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   Multicenter prospective study of 261 men scheduled for prostate biopsy at five academic and community centers in the USA enrolled between August 2015 and December 2016.  Intervention:   Performance of the IsoPSA assay.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Discrimination power was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The outcome of the IsoPSA assay was transformed into risk probability using logistic regression. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to compare the net benefit of IsoPSA against other clinical protocols.  Results and limitations:   The overall prevalence was 53% for any PCa and 34% for high-grade PCa. The area under the ROC curve was 0.79 for any cancer versus none and 0.81 for high-grade PCa versus low-grade PCa/benign histology. In this preliminary study, DCA revealed a superior net benefit of IsoPSA against no biopsy, all biopsy, and the modified Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator 2.0. At a cutoff selected to recommend biopsy, IsoPSA demonstrated a 48% reduction in false-positive biopsies; at a cutoff selected to identity men at low risk of high-grade disease, there was a 45% reduction in the false-positive rate.  Conclusion:   The structure-based IsoPSA assay outperformed concentration-based PSA measurement, and provided a net benefit against other protocols. Once validated, clinical use of IsoPSA could significantly reduce unnecessary biopsies while identifying patients needing treatment.

To address the role of endothelial Cx43 in this process, we analyzed Cx43 regulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in the proximity of Cx43high (DU-145 and MAT-LyLu) and Cx43low prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and AT-2). Endothelial Cx43 up-regulation was observed during the diapedesis of DU-145 and MAT-LyLu cells. This process was attenuated by transient Cx43 silencing in cancer cells and by chemical inhibition of ERK1/2-dependent signaling in endothelial cells. Cx43 expression in endothelial cells was insensitive to the inhibition of gap junctional intercellular coupling between Cx43high prostate cancer and endothelial cells by 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid. Instead, endothelial Cx43 up-regulation was correlated with the local contraction of endothelial cells and with their activation in the proximity of Cx43high DU-145 and MAT-LyLu cells. It was also sensitive to pro-inflammatory factors secreted by peripheral blood monocytes, such as TNFα. In contrast to Cx43low AT-2 cells, Cx43low PC-3 cells produced angioactive factors that locally activated the endothelial cells in the absence of endothelial Cx43 up-regulation. Collectively, these data show that Cx43low and Cx43high prostate cancer cells can adapt discrete, Cx43-independent and Cx43-dependent strategies of diapedesis. Our observations identify a novel strategy of prostate cancer cell diapedesis, which depends on the activation of intercellular Cx43/ERK1/2/Cx43 signaling axis at the interfaces between Cx43high prostate cancer and endothelial cells.""","""['Katarzyna Piwowarczyk', 'Milena Paw', 'Damian Ryszawy', 'Magdalena Rutkowska-Zapała', 'Zbigniew Madeja', 'Maciej Siedlar', 'Jarosław Czyż']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cell Biol""","""['DU-145 prostate carcinoma cells that selectively transmigrate narrow obstacles express elevated levels of Cx43.', 'Connexin 43 Is Necessary for Salivary Gland Branching Morphogenesis and FGF10-induced ERK1/2 Phosphorylation.', 'Beyond Gap Junction Channel Function: the Expression of Cx43 Contributes to Aldosterone-Induced Mesangial Cell Proliferation via the ERK1/2 and PKC Pathways.', 'Aberrant expression of Cx43 is associated with the peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer and Cx43-mediated gap junction enhances gastric cancer cell diapedesis from peritoneal mesothelium.', 'Connexin43 as a Tumor Suppressor: Proposed Connexin43 mRNA-circularRNAs-microRNAs Axis Towards Prevention and Early Detection in Breast Cancer.', 'StarD7 deficiency hinders cell motility through p-ERK1/2/Cx43 reduction.', 'Acquired drug resistance interferes with the susceptibility of prostate cancer cells to metabolic stress.', 'Temozolomide Induces the Acquisition of Invasive Phenotype by O6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT)+ Glioblastoma Cells in a Snail-1/Cx43-Dependent Manner.', 'Ouabain Promotes Gap Junctional Intercellular Communication in Cancer Cells.', 'Cx43 Present at the Leading Edge Membrane Governs Promigratory Effects of Osteoblast-Conditioned Medium on Human Prostate Cancer Cells in the Context of Bone Metastasis.']"""

However, patient-reported symptom burden data are still largely insufficient. This study sought to compare the self-reported symptom burden of men with chemotherapy-naive (CN) mCRPC treated with abiraterone acetate (AA) or enzalutamide (EZ) in routine clinical practice.  Materials and methods:   Between 2011 and 2015, 189 CN-mCRPC patients who had received AA (n = 76) or EZ (n = 113) at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre were included. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) score, baseline demographic information, comorbidities, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, laboratory data and narcotic analgesic use were recorded for each patient. The minimal clinically important difference was assessed using ±1 point change from baseline for each ESAS symptom. Mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used to estimate and compare the longitudinal ESAS score changes from baseline in AA and EZ groups adjusted for age, baseline ESAS scores, treatment group, treatment duration and time.  Results:   The median (interquartile range) treatment duration with AA and EZ was 10 (6-16) and 12 (7-18) months, respectively (P = 0.19). Fatigue was rated the most distressing symptom at baseline and following treatment in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful symptom improvement or worsening after AA or EZ administration in any of the ESAS-based physical and psychological symptoms over time.

An empirical evaluation of author usage in the biomedical literature""","""The phrase ""unmet medical need"" has important regulatory implications, but there is no empirical analysis of its real world usage. We sought to determine the annual US incidence, 5-year survival, and number of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-recommended regimens for indications described in the literature as an ""unmet medical need."" We queried Google Scholar to identify publications where authors used the phrase ""unmet medical need"" to refer to a specific cancer indication. For each indication, we investigated the annual US incidence, 5-year survival, and number of NCCN recommended regimens. We identified 237 cancer indications considered by authors an ""unmet medical need."" The term was found most frequently appended to breast cancer indications comprising 30 of the 237 citations (12.7%). This was followed by lung 24/237 (10.1%), hepatocellular 18/237 (7.6%), and prostate cancer 13/237 (5.4%). In 55 of 237 (23.2%) instances where an indication was described by the authors as an unmet medical need, the incidence was 1,000 cases per year, there were five regimens recommended by NCCN, and there was a 50% or greater 5-year survival. Forty-three of 237 (18.1%) indications had at least an incidence of 10,000 cases a year, 10 recommended regimens, and a 50% 5-year survival. In conclusion, ""unmet medical need"" has been used to describe cancer indications that are rare, and have few options and poor survival outcomes. However, the term has also been used to describe indications that occur commonly, have many treatment alternatives, and are clinically indolent with more encouraging expectations for survival.

Methods:   A total of 1,680 men with PSA ≤4 ng/mL had a prostate biopsy from January 2004 to December 2014. The differences in clinical factors were analyzed and their independent predictive implications were evaluated.  Results:   PCa was diagnosed in 331 (19.6%) and 99 of these 331 cancers (14.9%) had a Gleason score of 7 or higher. The detection rate of PCa increased from 6.67% (≤0.5 ng/mL) to 20.36% (3.01-3.9 ng/mL).

However, epidemiological studies have yet to evaluate the relationship between UFPs and cancer incidence.  Methods:   We conducted a case-control study of UFPs and incident prostate cancer in Montreal, Canada. Cases were identified from all main Francophone hospitals in the Montreal area between 2005 and 2009. Population controls were identified from provincial electoral lists of French Montreal residents and frequency-matched to cases using 5-year age groups. UFP exposures were estimated using a land use regression model. Exposures were assigned to residential locations at the time of diagnosis/recruitment as well as approximately 10-years earlier to consider potential latency between exposure and disease onset. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated per interquartile range (IQR) increase in UFPs (approximately 4000 particles/cm3) using logistic regression models adjusting for individual-level and ecological covariates.  Results:   Ambient UFP concentrations were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (OR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.19) in fully adjusted models when exposures were assigned to residences 10-years prior to diagnosis. This risk estimate increased slightly (OR=1.17, 95% CI; 1.01, 1.35) when modeled as a non-linear natural spline function. A smaller increased risk (OR=1.04, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.11) was observed when exposures were assigned to residences at the time of diagnosis.

Materials and Methods Eighteen patients with biopsy-proven PCa provided informed consent to be included in this institutional human ethics board-approved prospective study between January 2015 and January 2016. Patients underwent 3.0-T MR imaging shortly before radical prostatectomy. T2 distributions were generated with a regularized non-negative least squares algorithm from multiecho spin-echo MR imaging data. From T2 distributions, maps of seven MR parameters, Ncomp, T2short, T2long, geometric mean T2 (gmT2), luminal water fraction (LWF), Ashort, and Along, were generated and compared with digitized images of hematoxylin-eosin-stained whole-mount histologic slices. A paired t test was used to determine significant differences between MR parameters in malignant and nonmalignant tissue. Correlation with Gleason score (GS) was evaluated with the Spearman rank correlation test. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by using logistic generalized linear mixed-effect models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results The average values of four MR parameters (gmT2, Ashort, Along, and LWF) were significantly different between malignant and nonmalignant tissue. All MR parameters except for T2long showed significant correlation (P < .05) with GS in the peripheral zone. The highest correlation with GS was obtained for LWF (-0.78 ± 0.11, P < .001). ROC analysis demonstrated high accuracy for tumor detection, with the highest area under the ROC curve obtained for LWF (0.97 in the peripheral zone and 0.98 in the transition zone). Conclusion Results of this pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of luminal water imaging in the detection and grading of PCa.

From 2011 to 2015, 37 patients with prostate cancer (mean age 72.3+/-2.06 years) were treated with X-ray-guided endovascular chemoembolization. All patients had confirmed PCa, of whom 7 had stage T2a and 30 stage T2c disease. PSA ranged from 0.8 to17 ng/ml (mean 13.1+/-3.9). Prostate volume ranged from 61 to 93 cc3 (mean 69.4+/-9.3). The follow-up ranged from 8 to 42 months.  Results:   Prostatic artery embolization in BPH patients resulted in a significant reduction in IPSS symptom score and increase in Qmax. The volume of prostate and nodular mass decreased on average by 53% and 47%, respectively, maximum by 82%. Chemoembolization was effective in 31 (83.7%) patients. An objective response was achieved in reducing the PSA level and prostate volume measured by TRUS, and improved urination. The median PSA at 6 months was - 3.4 +/- 0.02 ng/ml.

Aim:   To investigate the rates of regaining continence and erectile function (EF) after nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy (NS-RRP) and nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (NS-LRP) in the early postoperative period.  Materials and methods:   The study comprised 116 patients who preserved sexual activity and the ability to have sex. 64 patients underwent standard resection of NVB (34 RRP and 30 LRP) and in 52 patients the NVB resection was performed using a waterjet dissector (WD) (30 RRP and 22 LRP). All operations were performed by one surgeon with the experience of over 350 RRP and 150 LRP. The study patients had low and moderate risk prostate cancer, according to DAmico risk classification.  Results:   Our study findings showed that patients who underwent the WD of NVB had significantly greater IIEF-5 scores (by 2.8 scores) at 8 weeks than after the standard NS-RP. After 6 month follow-up the scores increased by 3.5 points. Patients who underwent NS-RP + WD achieved a successful sexual intercourse 3 months after surgery (regardless of the use of PDE5 inhibitors). In the group of patients who underwent standard NS-RP, it took a longer time to achieve a successful sexual intercourse. Sixty-seven percent of patients who underwent NS-RP + WD were fully continent at one month follow-up after removal of urethral catheter, while most patients treated with standard NS-RP (41%) had mild stress UI.

It is noteworthy that from 2004 to 2014, the proportion of patients with stage I-II prostate cancer increased from 35.5% to 52.5%, while that of patients with stages III and IV disease decreased from 38.4% to 29% and from 22.7% to 16.5%, respectively. All of this allows an increasing number of prostate cancer patients to be treated with radical treatment - low dose-rate brachytherapy. For the first time in this country, we report a clinical trial of low dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer using domestically manufactured I-125 seeds. The successful results of this clinical trial are presented in this article. The aim of this work was to show the clinical efficacy and safety of domestically manufactured I-125 seeds for low dose-rate prostate cancer brachytherapy.  Materials and methods:   The clinical trial comprised 36 patients with stage T1-T2 prostate cancer. Patients were randomly assigned according to the risk of cancer progression. Low and intermediate risk groups comprised 30 (83.3%) and 6 (16.7%) patients, respectively. Patients of low risk group underwent brachytherapy alone with the minimum therapeutic dose of 145 Gy. I-125 seeds of two activities, 0.55 and 0.35 mCi per seed were used for implantation. Depending on the prostate volume, from 40 to 80 seeds, 57 on average were implanted. Mean implantation time was 85 minutes. In patients of the intermediate risk group brachytherapy was performed in combination with laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy which was carried out 4-5 weeks prior to brachytherapy.  Results:   Follow-up examination at 6 months after implantation showed that PSA decreased in all patients on average by 87% from the baseline. No adverse events were reported.

We compare the efficacy of degarelix and goserelin plus bicalutamide in improving LUTS in PCa patients.  Methods:   Data were pooled from three Phase 3, randomized clinical trials of once-monthly treatment for 12 weeks with degarelix (240/80 mg; n = 289) or goserelin (3.6 mg) plus bicalutamide (50 mg; n = 174) for initial flare protection. LUTS at weeks 4, 8, and 12 were compared to baseline. Clinically relevant LUTS relief was a ≥3-point International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) decrease. Adverse events were assessed throughout the trials.  Results:   Patients receiving degarelix had significantly greater decreases in IPSS vs. goserelin at week 12 (adjusted difference: -1.24; 95% CI -2.33 to -0.14, P = 0.03). Clinically relevant LUTS relief with degarelix was especially pronounced in patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS (baseline IPSS ≥13) (odds ratio; OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.19-4.47, P = 0.01) and advanced PCa (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.10-5.04, P = 0.03). A twofold higher OR for early (week 4) LUTS relief was seen with degarelix vs. goserelin (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.14-3.60, P = 0.02). No difference in total prostate volume or urinary tract infection-related adverse events (2%) was seen between treatment groups.

Here, we used the inflammation-associated prostate cellular transformation model to screen out a crucial microRNA, miR186, which was significantly downregulated in the transformed cells and effectively rescued the transformed phenotype. On stimulation of inflammatory cytokines, the activated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)/p65 was able to induce miR186 expression through binding to its promoter in non-transformed cells, whereas this pathway was lost in transformed cells. Interestingly, Twist1, which is a reported downstream target of miR186, was responsible for the loss of NF-κB/p65-miR186 pathway. Twist1 downregulated miR186 expression in a novel negative feedback loop binding to the E-box and simultaneously recruiting Dnmt3a, which facilitated the site-specific CpG methylation of the miR186 promoter, thereby blocked the transcriptional activity of NF-κB/p65 and the responsiveness of miR186 to inflammatory signals. The high level of Twist1 triggered this feedback loop that underlies the epigenetic switch, which was essential for maintaining transformed and advanced PCa state.

Activated GNA12 also promotes prostate and breast cancer cell invasion in vitro and in vivo, and its expression is up-regulated in many tumors, particularly metastatic tissues. In this study, we explored the control of expression of GNA12 in prostate cancer cells. Initial studies on LnCAP (low metastatic potential, containing low levels of GNA12) and PC3 (high metastatic potential, containing high GNA12 levels) cells revealed that GNA12 mRNA levels correlated with protein levels, suggesting control at the transcriptional level. To identify potential factors controlling GNA12 transcription, we cloned the upstream 5' regulatory region of the human GNA12 gene and examined its activity using reporter assays. Deletion analysis revealed the highest level of promoter activity in a 784 bp region, and subsequent in silico analysis indicated the presence of transcription factor binding sites for C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein), CREB1 (cAMP-response-element-binding protein 1), and c-Jun in this minimal element for transcriptional control. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown approach revealed that silencing of c-Jun expression significantly reduced GNA12 5' regulatory region reporter activity. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that c-Jun binds to the GNA12 5' regulatory region in PC3 cells. Silencing of c-Jun expression reduced mRNA and protein levels of GNA12, but not the closely-related GNA13, in prostate cancer cells. Understanding the mechanisms by which GNA12 expression is controlled may aid in the development of therapies that target key elements responsible for GNA12-mediated tumor progression.""","""['Udhaya Kumari Udayappan', 'Patrick J Casey']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Stat3 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP-beta) regulate Jab1/CSN5 expression in mammary carcinoma cells.', 'JUN-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein complexes inhibit surfactant-associated protein B promoter activity.', 'The role of sLZIP in transcriptional regulation of c-Jun and involvement in migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells.', 'E2F sites in the Op18 promoter are required for high level of expression in the human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3-M.', 'Dysregulated Transcriptional Control in Prostate Cancer.', 'JUN-induced super-enhancer RNA forms R-loop to promote nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastasis.', 'Integrated analysis of long non-coding RNA-microRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNAregulatory networks in thromboangiitis obliterans.', 'A Poliovirus Receptor (CD155)-Related Risk Signature Predicts the Prognosis of Bladder Cancer.', 'Genome-Wide Association Analysis Reveals Key Genes Responsible for Egg Production of Lion Head Goose.', 'Reduced expression of microRNA-139-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma results in a poor outcome: An exploration the roles of microRNA-139-5p in tumorigenesis, advancement and prognosis at the molecular biological level using an integrated meta-analysis and bioinformatic investigation.']"""

Nanosize carriers are a suitable platform for this specific delivery. Herein, we evaluated the long-term stability of the naturally found protein nanocarrier apoferritin (Apo) with encapsulated doxorubicin (Dox). The encapsulation was performed using Apo's ability to disassemble reversibly into its subunits at low pH (2.7) and reassemble in neutral pH (7.2), physically entrapping drug molecules in its cavity (creating ApoDox). In this study, ApoDox was prepared in water and phosphate-buffered saline and stored for 12 weeks in various conditions (-20°C, 4°C, 20°C, and 37°C in dark, and 4°C and 20°C under ambient light). During storage, a very low amount of prematurely released drug molecules were detected (maximum of 7.5% for ApoDox prepared in PBS and 4.4% for ApoDox prepared in water). Fourier-transform infrared spectra revealed no significant differences in any of the samples after storage. Most of the ApoDox prepared in phosphate-buffered saline and ApoDox prepared in water and stored at -20°C formed very large aggregates (up to 487% of original size). Only ApoDox prepared in water and stored at 4°C showed no significant increase in size or shape. Although this storage caused slower internalization to LNCaP prostate cancer cells, ApoDox (2.5 μM of Dox) still retained its ability to inhibit completely the growth of 1.5×104 LNCaP cells after 72 hours. ApoDox stored at 20°C and 37°C in water was not able to deliver Dox inside the nucleus, and thus did not inhibit the growth of the LNCaP cells. Overall, our study demonstrates that ApoDox has very good stability over the course of 12 weeks when stored properly (at 4°C), and is thus suitable for use as a nanocarrier in the specific delivery of anticancer drugs to patients.""","""['Simona Dostalova', 'Katerina Vasickova', 'David Hynek', 'Sona Krizkova', 'Lukas Richtera', 'Marketa Vaculovicova', 'Tomas Eckschlager', 'Marie Stiborova', 'Zbynek Heger', 'Vojtech Adam']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Site-Directed Conjugation of Antibodies to Apoferritin Nanocarrier for Targeted Drug Delivery to Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Apoferritin nanocages with Au nanoshell coating as drug carrier for multistimuli-responsive drug release.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Site-Directed Antibody-Conjugated Apoferritin Nanovehicle Favorably Influences In Vivo Side Effects of Doxorubicin.', 'Apoferritin: a potential nanocarrier for cancer imaging and drug delivery.', 'Nanocarrier-Based Therapeutics and Theranostics Drug Delivery Systems for Next Generation of Liver Cancer Nanodrug Modalities.', 'Impact of Nano Preparation of Phytoconstituents in Medulloblastoma.', 'Near-Infrared Light-Responsive Shell-Crosslinked Micelles of Poly(d,l-lactide)-b-poly((furfuryl methacrylate)-co-(N-acryloylmorpholine)) Prepared by Diels-Alder Reaction for the Triggered Release of Doxorubicin.', 'Cancer-Targeted Controlled Delivery of Chemotherapeutic Anthracycline Derivatives Using Apoferritin Nanocage Carriers.', 'Recent Progress of Nanocarrier-Based Therapy for Solid Malignancies.', 'Norepinephrine transporter-derived homing peptides enable rapid endocytosis of drug delivery nanovehicles into neuroblastoma cells.']"""

Methods:   A questionnaire was sent to 1464 urologists, medical oncologists and radiotherapists, about a clinical case; it was about a patient presenting a prostate cancer, evolving from a biologic progression after radical prostatectomy to a situation of metastasis resistant to the castration. The questionnaire contained ten questions about reasons of changing treatment because of progression, and about modalities of the follow-up.  Results:   A total of 318 questionnaires were analyzed (response rate of 22%). The results showed comparable practices between the different types of specialists, even if a more frequent rhythm of surveillance was reported by medical oncologists and radiotherapists. At progression after radical prostatectomy, a clinical and biological surveillance was generally realized every 3 or 6 months, and imaging exams were done on demand. Then, as the cancer progresses, the surveillance became systematic and more and more close, with imaging done every 3 months or on demand. While the definition of progression was essentially based on PSA testing at the beginning of the castration resistance, it then combines different clinical, biological and radiological criteria.  Conclusions:   There are few recommendations available about follow-up of patients with a mCRPC. In that survey, the oncologists and urologists reported a more intensive rhythm of surveillance as the prostate cancer progresses.

While several observational studies have shown better functional outcomes following seminal vesicle sparing approaches, evidence from randomized trials is lacking. We performed a randomized controlled trial comparing functional and cancer control outcomes between nerve sparing prostatectomy augmented with seminal vesicle sparing and standard nerve sparing prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   A total of 140 men with early stage prostate cancer were enrolled in a randomized phase II trial comparing nerve sparing prostatectomy augmented with seminal vesicle sparing to standard nerve sparing prostatectomy. Patient reported sexual and urinary functional scores were assessed prior to surgery, and 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Surgical margin status and prostate specific antigen recurrence were evaluated as secondary outcomes.  Results:   There were no differences in sexual or urinary function scores after surgery between the study groups. The median urinary incontinence domain score was 92 in the nerve sparing group and 87.5 in the nerve plus seminal vesicle sparing group at 12 months (p = 0.77). Median sexual function domain scores were 73.7 in the nerve sparing group and 77.1 in the nerve sparing plus seminal vesicle sparing group at 12 months (p = 0.29). Margin status and 12-month biochemical recurrence were similar in the groups.  Conclusions:   Recovery of continence and sexual function was similar between the groups in this randomized controlled trial. Seminal vesicle sparing did not negatively affect margin status or 12-month biochemical (prostate specific antigen) recurrence. These results suggest limited usefulness of seminal vesicle sparing prostatectomy.""","""['Scott M Gilbert', 'Rodney L Dunn', 'David C Miller', 'Jeffrey S Montgomery', 'Ted A Skolarus', 'Alon Z Weizer', 'David P Wood Jr', 'Brent K Hollenbeck']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Seminal monolateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy in selected patients.', 'The Effect of Nerve Sparing Status on Sexual and Urinary Function: 3-Year Results from the CEASAR Study.', 'Functional Recovery, Oncologic Outcomes and Postoperative Complications after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: An Evidence-Based Analysis Comparing the Retzius Sparing and Standard Approaches.', 'A Critical Analysis of the Current Knowledge of Surgical Anatomy of the Prostate Related to Optimisation of Cancer Control and Preservation of Continence and Erection in Candidates for Radical Prostatectomy: An Update.', ""Intrafascial nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy improves patients' postoperative continence recovery and erectile function: A pooled analysis based on available literatures."", 'Robotic radical prostatectomy: analysis of midterm pathologic and oncologic outcomes: A historical series from a high-volume center.', 'Anatomical robotic prostatectomy: technical factors to achieve superb continence and erectile function.', 'Considering the role of radical prostatectomy in 21st century prostate cancer care.', 'Management of low-risk prostate cancer in patients with enlarged glands and lower urinary tract symptoms: robotic total prostatectomy, a novel technique.', 'Round-up.']"""

The aim is to propose a methodology to characterize the therapeutic window by means of an integral radiobiological approach, which considers not only Tumour Control Probability (TCP) and Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) but also Secondary Cancer Probability (SCP).  Methods:   Uncomplicated and Cancer-Free Control Probability (UCFCP) function has been proposed assuming a statistically uncorrelated response for tumour and normal tissues. The Poisson's and Lyman's models were chosen for TCP and NTCP calculations, respectively. SCP was modelled as the summation of risks associated to photon and neutron irradiation of radiosensitive organs. For the medium (>4Gy) and low dose regions, mechanistic and linear secondary cancer risks models were used, respectively. Two conformal and intensity-modulated prostate plans at 15MV (same prescription dose) were selected to illustrate the UCFCP features.  Results:   UCFCP exhibits a bell-shaped behaviour with its maximum inside the therapeutic window. SCP values were not different for the plans analysed (∼2.4%) and agreed with published epidemiological results. Therefore, main differences in UCFCP came from differences in rectal NTCP (18% vs 9% for 3D-CRT and IMRT, respectively). According to UCFCP values, the evaluated IMRT plan ranked first.  Conclusions:   The level of SCP was found to be similar to that of NTCP complications which reinforces the importance of considering second cancer risks as part of the possible late sequelae due to treatment. Previous concerns about the effect of peripheral radiation, especially neutrons, in the induction of secondary cancers can be evaluated by quantifying the UCFCP.""","""['Beatriz Sánchez-Nieto', 'Maite Romero-Expósito', 'José A Terrón', 'Francisco Sánchez-Doblado']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Individualized Fraction Regimen of SBRT Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Based on Uncomplicated and Cancer-Free Control Probability.', 'External photon radiation treatment for prostate cancer: Uncomplicated and cancer-free control probability assessment of 36 plans.', 'Radiobiological impact of reduced margins and treatment technique for prostate cancer in terms of tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP).', 'A REVIEW OF ANALYTICAL MODELS OF STRAY RADIATION EXPOSURES FROM PHOTON- AND PROTON-BEAM RADIOTHERAPIES.', 'Out-of-field organ doses and associated risk of cancer development following radiation therapy with photons.', 'A simple analytical model for a fast 3D assessment of peripheral photon dose during coplanar isocentric photon radiotherapy.', 'Determining Out-of-Field Doses and Second Cancer Risk From Proton Therapy in Young Patients-An Overview.', 'Estimating cancer risks due to whole lungs low dose radiotherapy with different techniques for treating COVID-19 pneumonia.', 'Individualized Fraction Regimen of SBRT Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Based on Uncomplicated and Cancer-Free Control Probability.', 'Low dose radiation therapy for COVID-19: Effective dose and estimation of cancer risk.']"""

Materials and methods:   The patients who came to the Department of Urology at Abant Izzet Baysal University Medical Faculty from December 2006 to December 2009 for prostate biopsy were questioned for cigarette smoking. The patients were divided into 2 groups, namely, smokers and nonsmokers. Paraffin sections were stained immunohistochemically with p53, PTEN, p16INK4a, MSH2, CHK2, RB, and E-cadherin.  Results:   Smoking was the main independent factor that had an effect on the immunohistochemical expressions for p53, p16, and PTEN (P = 0.007, P = 0.036, P = 0.015, respectively). Age and inflammation had no statistically significant effects on gene expressions. No difference was found between smokers and nonsmokers for immunohistochemical expressions of E-cadherin, MSH2, RB, and CHK2.

But the underlying mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we firstly assessed how curcumin affects the expression of miR-143/miR-145 cluster. Then, we investigated whether miR-143 is involved in regulation of radiosensitivity and its association with autophagy in prostate cancer cells. Our data showed that PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells treated with curcumin had significantly restored miR-143 and miR-145 expression. Curcumin showed similar effect as 5-AZA-dC on reducing methylation of CpG dinucleotides in miR-143 promoter. In addition, curcumin treatment reduced the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B, which contribute to promoter hypermethylation of the miR-143/miR-145 cluster. Therefore, we infer that curcumin can restore miR-143 and miR-145 expression via hypomethylation. MiR-143 overexpression and curcumin pretreatment enhanced radiation induced cancer cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. MiR-143 and curcumin remarkably reduced radiation-induced autophagy in PC3 and DU145 cells. MiR-143 overexpression alone also reduced the basal level of autophagy in DU145 cells. Mechanistically, miR-143 can suppress autophagy in prostate cancer cells at least via downregulating ATG2B.

Here, we provide novel insights into treatment response for the antiandrogen abiraterone by analyses of a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model with combined inactivation of Trp53 and Pten, which are frequently comutated in human CRPC. These NPp53 mice fail to respond to abiraterone and display accelerated progression to tumors resembling treatment-related CRPC with neuroendocrine differentiation (CRPC-NE) in humans. Cross-species computational analyses identify master regulators of adverse response that are conserved with human CRPC-NE, including the neural differentiation factor SOX11, which promotes neuroendocrine differentiation in cells derived from NPp53 tumors. Furthermore, abiraterone-treated NPp53 prostate tumors contain regions of focal and/or overt neuroendocrine differentiation, distinguished by their proliferative potential. Notably, lineage tracing in vivo provides definitive and quantitative evidence that focal and overt neuroendocrine regions arise by transdifferentiation of luminal adenocarcinoma cells. These findings underscore principal roles for TP53 and PTEN inactivation in abiraterone resistance and progression from adenocarcinoma to CRPC-NE by transdifferentiation.Significance: Understanding adverse treatment response and identifying patients likely to fail treatment represent fundamental clinical challenges. By integrating analyses of GEM models and human clinical data, we provide direct genetic evidence for transdifferentiation as a mechanism of drug resistance as well as for stratifying patients for treatment with antiandrogens.

Alkaline phosphatase velocity (APV) has been shown to predict overall survival (OS) and bone metastasis-free survival (BMFS) in an earlier study of an equal access military patient cohort of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). To confirm these findings, we examined a cohort of patients from a high-volume cancer center to validate a previous observation that faster alkaline phosphatase (AP) kinetics are predictive of OS and BMFS in this second cohort of patients.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted of patients with CRPC treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 1989 and 2010. All patients who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as primary treatment in response to a rising PSA after definitive surgery for CaP were eligible. For those who received primary ADT or surgery followed by ADT, CRPC was defined as one rising PSA value after a PSA nadir ≤4ng/ml, and confirmed by a second rising PSA value, with concurrently documented testosterone levels <50ng/dl. APV was computed as the slope of the linear regression line of all AP values (>2 values per patient) plotted against time. Study outcome included BMFS and OS. Univariable Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to examine time-to-event outcomes. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to model time to BMFS and OS.  Results:   Of 89 patients with CRPC with evaluable data and CRPC, 17 (19%) experienced BM and 26 (29%) died. APV was dichotomized at the uppermost quartile split of all observed APV values:≥5.42U/l/y vs. the lower 3 quartiles combined,<5.42U/l/y. Patients with faster APV had significantly worse outcomes, including faster progression to BM and poorer OS when compared with those with slower APV (P = 0.0451 and P = 0.0109, respectively). There was strong correlation between PSA doubling time (PSADT) (<10,≥10mo) and APV (≥5.42U/l/y vs.<5.42U/l/y) (P = 0.0289), preventing simultaneous evaluation of both factors in multivariable analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that PSADT was also predictive of BM and OS (log-rank P<0.0001). Separate multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine PSADT and APV, as predictors of each study outcome (BMFS and OS). Both PSADT and APV were strongly predictive of BMFS and OS (respectively).  Conclusions:   APV and PSADT were predictors of BM and OS in patients with CRPC, respectively. These data are additional evidence of the potential value of AP kinetics in patients with advanced CaP. Prospective studies will be required to clarify these associations. However, given the restrictions on the current patient population in excluding metastatic disease within 12 months of ADT and a PSA nadir >4ng/ml, the findings are not inappropriately generalized to other men.""","""['Kai H Hammerich', 'Timothy F Donahue', 'Inger L Rosner', 'Jennifer Cullen', 'Huai-Ching Kuo', 'Lauren Hurwitz', 'Yongmei Chen', 'Melanie Bernstein', 'Jonathan Coleman', 'Daniel C Danila', 'Adam R Metwalli']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Elevated alkaline phosphatase velocity strongly predicts overall survival and the risk of bone metastases in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Alkaline Phosphatase Kinetics Predict Metastasis among Prostate Cancer Patients Who Experience Relapse following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Dynamic changes of alkaline phosphatase are strongly associated with PSA-decline and predict best clinical benefit earlier than PSA-changes under therapy with abiraterone acetate in bone metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The utility of prostate-specific antigen in the management of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Management of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Machine learning algorithms to estimate 10-Year survival in patients with bone metastases due to prostate cancer: toward a disease-specific survival estimation tool.', 'Elucidation and control of low and high active populations of alkaline phosphatase molecules for quantitative digital bioassay.', 'Radium-223 Treatment Increases Immune Checkpoint Expression in Extracellular Vesicles from the Metastatic Prostate Cancer Bone Microenvironment.', 'Clinical implication of prognostic and predictive biomarkers for castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Values of alkaline phosphatase at the diagnosis of castration resistance and response to primary androgen deprivation therapy as predictors of subsequent metastasis in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

The purpose of this study was to quantify the uncertainties of a published biological model and explore their impact on variable RBE treatment plan (TP) optimization.  Methods:   Two patient cases with a high and a low (α/β)x tumor were investigated. Firstly, intensity modulated proton therapy TPs assuming constant RBE were derived, and subsequently the variable RBE weighted dose (RWD), including the uncertainty originating in the fit to the experimental data and the uncertainty of the (α/β)x, were calculated. Secondly, TPs optimized for uniform biological effect assuming a variable RBE were created using the worst case tissue specific (α/β)x.  Results:   For the nasopharyngeal cancer patient, the uncertainty of (α/β)x corresponded to a CTV D98 confidence interval (CI) of (-2, +4)% while for the fit parameter CI was (-2,+1)%. For the standard fractionation prostate case the (α/β)x CI was (-7,+5)% and the fit parameter CI was (-3,+3)%. For the hypofractionated case both CIs were (-1,+1)%. In both patient cases, the RBE in most organs at risk (OARs) was significantly underestimated by the constant RBE approximation, whereas the situation was not as definite in the target volumes. Overdosage of OARs was reduced by using the biological effect optimization.  Conclusion:   For the two patient cases, the RWD uncertainty from the fit parameter in the biological model contributed non-negligibly to the total uncertainty, depending on the patient case and the organ. The presented optimization strategy is a basic method for robust biological effect optimization to reduce potential consequences caused by the (α/β)x uncertainty.""","""['A F Resch', 'G Landry', 'F Kamp', 'G Cabal', 'C Belka', 'J J Wilkens', 'K Parodi', 'G Dedes']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Incorporation of relative biological effectiveness uncertainties into proton plan robustness evaluation.', 'Variance-based sensitivity analysis for uncertainties in proton therapy: A framework to assess the effect of simultaneous uncertainties in range, positioning, and RBE model predictions on RBE-weighted dose distributions.', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness Uncertainties and Implications for Beam Arrangements and Dose Constraints in Proton Therapy.', 'Proton relative\xa0biological\xa0effectiveness (RBE): a multiscale problem.', 'Spatial Agreement of Brainstem Dose Distributions Depending on Biological Model in Proton Therapy for Pediatric Brain Tumors.', 'Benchmarking a GATE/Geant4 Monte Carlo model for proton beams in magnetic fields.', 'Proton Relative Biological Effectiveness - Uncertainties and Opportunities.']"""

Material and methods:   two sets of 35 low risk (LR) and 30 intermediate risk (IR) prostate cancer cases who underwent HT treatments were selected to train RapidPlan models. The KB predicted constraints were used to perform new 20KB plans using RapidArc technique (KB-RA) (inter-technique validation), and to optimise 20 new HT (KB-HT) plans in the Tomoplan (inter-system validation). For each validation modality, KB plans were benchmarked with the manual plans created by an expert planner (EP).  Results:   RapidPlan was successfully configured using HT plans. The KB-RA plans fulfilled the clinical dose-volume requirements in 100% and 92% of cases for planning target volumes (PTVs) and organs at risk (OARs), respectively. For KB-HT plans these percentages were found to be a bit lower: 90% for PTVs and 86% for OARs. In comparison to EP plans, the KB-RA plans produced higher bladder doses for both LR and IR, and higher rectum doses for LR. KB-HT and EP plans produced similar results.  Conclusion:   RapidPlan can be trained to create models by using plans of a different treatment modality.

Methods:   Two sets of CBCT projections were acquired using the X-ray volumetric imaging (XVI) system on a Synergy (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) system with 120kV (high) and 70kV (low) X-rays, respectively. Then, the electron density relative to water (relative electron density (RED)) of each voxel was calculated using a projection-based dual-energy decomposition method. As a comparison, single-energy cone-beam computed tomography (SE-CBCT) was used to calculate RED with the Hounsfield unit-RED calibration curve generated by a CIRS phantom scan with identical imaging parameters. The imaging dose was measured with a dosimetry phantom. The image quality was evaluated quantitatively using a Catphan 503 phantom with the evaluation indices of the reproducibility of the RED values, high-contrast resolution (MTF50%), uniformity, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Dose calculation of two simulated volumetric-modulated arc therapy plans using an Eclipse treatment-planning system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was performed on an Alderson Rando Head and Neck (H&N) phantom and a Pelvis phantom. Fan-beam planning CT images for the H&N and Pelvis phantom were set as the reference. A global three-dimensional gamma analysis was used to compare dose distributions with the reference. The average gamma values for targets and OAR were analyzed with paired t-tests between DE-CBCT and SE-CBCT.  Results:   In two scans (H&N scan and body scan), the imaging dose of DE-CBCT increased by 1.0% and decreased by 1.3%. It had a better reproducibility of the RED values (mean bias: 0.03 and 0.07) compared with SE-CBCT (mean bias: 0.13 and 0.16). It also improved the image uniformity (57.5% and 30.1%) and SNR (9.7% and 2.3%), but did not affect the MTF50%. Gamma analyses of the 3D dose distribution with criteria of 1%/1mm showed a pass rate of 99.0-100% and 85.3-97.6% for DE-CBCT and 73.5-99.1% and 80.4-92.7% for SE-CBCT. The average gamma values were reduced significantly by DE-CBCT (p< 0.05). Gamma index maps showed that matching of the dose distribution between CBCT-based and reference was improved by DE-CBCT.

Methods:   A retrospective population based analysis was carried out for individuals with HIV/AIDS that began their treatment between 1996 and 2008.  Results:   There were 145 (2.95%) NADMs and 123 (2.50%) AIDS defining malignancies (ADMs) identified in 4918 PLWHA in the study population.

PLWHA had a SIR of 2.05 (CI:1.73, 2.41) for the development of NADMs compared to individuals without an HIV/AIDS diagnosis in the general population. Independent factors significantly associated with a NADM were: male gender, older age, lower CD4 cell counts, previous NADM, absence of HAART (non-HAART versus HAART) and treatment during the early-HAART era (before 2000 versus after 2000).

Although it can be well managed and non-life threatening in the early stages, over time many patients cease to respond to treatment and develop castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC represents a clinically challenging and lethal form of prostate cancer. Progression of CRPC is, in part, driven by the ability of cancer cells to alter their metabolic profile during the course of tumourgenesis and metastasis so that they can survive in oxygen and nutrient-poor environments and even withstand treatment. This work was carried out as a continuation of a study aimed towards gaining greater mechanistic understanding of how conditions within the tumour microenvironment impact on both androgen sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen independent (LNCaP-abl and LNCaP-abl-Hof) prostate cancer cell lines. Here we have applied technically robust and reproducible label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis for comprehensive proteomic profiling of prostate cancer cell lines under hypoxic conditions. This led to the identification of over 4,000 proteins - one of the largest protein datasets for prostate cancer cell lines established to date. The biological and clinical significance of proteins showing a significant change in expression as result of hypoxic conditions was established. Novel, intuitive workflows were subsequently implemented to enable robust, reproducible and high throughput verification of selected proteins of interest.

Socioeconomic patterns in all-cancer, lung, and colorectal cancer mortality changed dramatically over time. Individuals in more deprived areas or lower education and income groups had higher mortality and incidence rates than their more affluent counterparts, with excess risk being particularly marked for lung, colorectal, cervical, stomach, and liver cancer. Education and income inequalities in mortality from all-cancers, lung, prostate, and cervical cancer increased during 1979-2011. Socioeconomic inequalities in cancer mortality widened as mortality in lower socioeconomic groups/areas declined more slowly. Mortality was higher among Blacks and lower among Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics than Whites.

Tumorigenesis and progression of prostate cancer involves multiple signaling pathways, including the Hippo pathway. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is the downstream transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo pathway, is overexpressed in prostate cancer, and plays a vital role in the tumorigenesis and progression of prostate cancer. However, the role of the YAP paralog and another downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), in prostate cancer has not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that TAZ is a basal cell marker for the prostate epithelium. We found that overexpression of TAZ promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, and anchorage-independent growth in the RWPE1 prostate epithelial cells. Of note, knock down of TAZ in the DU145 prostate cancer cells inhibited cell migration and metastasis. We also found that SH3 domain binding protein 1 (SH3BP1), a RhoGAP protein that drives cell motility, is a direct target gene of TAZ in the prostate cancer cells, mediating TAZ function in enhancing cell migration. Moreover, the prostate cancer-related oncogenic E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factors, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5, were required for TAZ gene transcription in PC3 prostate cancer cells. MAPK inhibitor U0126 treatment decreased TAZ expression in RWPE1 cells, and ETV4 overexpression rescued TAZ expression in RWPE1 cells with U0126 treatment. Our results show a regulatory mechanism of TAZ transcription and suggest a significant role for TAZ in the progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Chen-Ying Liu', 'Tong Yu', 'Yuji Huang', 'Long Cui', 'Wanjin Hong']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Specific and redundant activities of ETV1 and ETV4 in prostate cancer aggressiveness revealed by co-overexpression cellular contexts.', 'Binding of TMPRSS2-ERG to BAF Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Mediates Prostate Oncogenesis.', 'Ski regulates Hippo and TAZ signaling to suppress breast cancer progression.', 'The Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'ETV1, 4 and 5: an oncogenic subfamily of ETS transcription factors.', 'SH3BP1 Regulates Melanoma Progression Through Race1/Wace2 Signaling Pathway.', 'E26 transformation-specific transcription variant 5 in development and cancer: modification, regulation and function.', 'Emerging Role of YAP and the Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'Human CPTP promotes growth and metastasis via sphingolipid metabolite ceramide and PI4KA/AKT signaling in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Interplay of Developmental Hippo-Notch Signaling Pathways with the DNA Damage Response in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Although marked therapeutic effects have been demonstrated, brachytherapy needs a complicated implantation technique under general anesthesia and the seeds could migrate to other organs. The aim of this study was to establish a novel brachytherapy using biocompatible, injectable thermoresponsive polymers (polyoxazoline [POZ]) labeled with 90Y, which can self-aggregate above a specific transition temperature (Tt), resulting in long-term intratumoral retention of radioactivity and therapeutic effect. Therefore, we evaluated the tumor retention of radiolabeled POZ derivatives and their therapeutic effects. Methods: Using oxazoline derivatives with ethyl (Et), isopropyl (Isp), and propyl (Pr) side chains, we synthesized EtPOZ, IspPOZ, Isp-PrPOZ (heteropolymer), and PrPOZ and measured their characteristic Tts. The intratumoral retention of 111In-labeled POZ was evaluated until 7 d after injection in nude mice bearing PC-3 human prostate cancer. The intratumoral localization of 111In-labeled POZ derivatives was investigated by an autoradiographic study. Furthermore, a therapeutic study using 90Y-labeled Isp-PrPOZ was performed, and tumor growth and survival rate were evaluated. Results: The Tts of EtPOZ, IspPOZ, Isp-PrPOZ, and PrPOZ (∼20 kDa) were greater than 70°C, 34°C, 25°C, and 19°C, respectively. In the intratumoral injection study, Isp-PrPOZ and PrPOZ (2,000 μM) with Tts lower than tumor temperature (33.5°C under anesthesia) showed a significantly higher retention of radioactivity at 1 d after injection (73.6% and 73.9%, respectively) than EtPOZ (5.6%) and IspPOZ (15.8%). Even at low injected dose (100 μM), Isp-PrPOZ exhibited high retention (68.3% at 1 d). The high level of radioactivity of Isp-PrPOZ was retained in the tumor 7 d after injection (69.5%). The autoradiographic study demonstrated that the radioactivity of 111In-labeled Isp-PrPOZ and PrPOZ was localized in a small area. In the therapeutic study using 90Y-labeled Isp-PrPOZ, significant suppression of tumor growth and prolonged survival rate were achieved in an injection dose-dependent manner compared with that observed for the vehicle-injected group and nonradioactive Isp-PrPOZ-injected group.

Radiopharmacy staff are accustomed to such procedures in the daily preparation of 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals. Currently, chelating agents used in 68Ga radiopharmaceuticals do not meet this ideal. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate preclinically a 68Ga radiotracer for imaging PSMA expression that could be radiolabeled simply by addition of 68Ga generator eluate to a cold kit. Methods: A conjugate of a tris(hydroxypyridinone) (THP) chelator with the established urea-based PSMA inhibitor was synthesized and radiolabeled with 68Ga by adding generator eluate directly to a vial containing the cold precursors THP-PSMA and sodium bicarbonate, with no further manipulation. It was analyzed after 5 min by instant thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The product was subjected to in vitro studies to determine PSMA affinity using PSMA-expressing DU145-PSMA cells, with their nonexpressing analog DU145 as a control. In vivo PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies were performed in mice bearing xenografts of the same cell lines, comparing 68Ga-THP-PSMA with 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA. Results: Radiolabeling was complete (>95%) within 5 min at room temperature, showing a single radioactive species by high-performance liquid chromatography that was stable in human serum for more than 6 h and showed specific binding to PSMA-expressing cells (concentration giving 50% inhibition of 361 ± 60 nM). In vivo PET imaging showed specific uptake in PSMA-expressing tumors, reaching 5.6 ± 1.2 percentage injected dose per cubic centimeter at 40-60 min and rapid clearance from blood to kidney and bladder. The tumor uptake, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetics were not significantly different from those of 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA except for reduced uptake in the spleen. Conclusion:68Ga-THP-PSMA has equivalent imaging properties but greatly simplified radiolabeling compared with other 68Ga-PSMA conjugates.

Salvage therapies empirically conducted with 50 (n = 4), 100 (n = 4), 150 (n = 2), and 200 kBq/kg (n = 4) of 225Ac-PSMA-617 were evaluated retrospectively regarding toxicity and treatment response.

Results: Dosimetry estimates for 1 MBq of 225Ac-PSMA-617 assuming a relative biologic effectiveness of 5 revealed mean doses of 2.3 Sv for salivary glands, 0.7 Sv for kidneys, and 0.05 Sv for red marrow that are composed of 99.4% α, 0.5% β, and 0.1% photon radiation, respectively. In clinical application, severe xerostomia became the dose-limiting toxicity if treatment activity exceeded 100 kBq/kg per cycle. At 100 kBq/kg, the duration of prostate-specific antigen decline was less than 4 mo, but if therapy was repeated every 2 mo patients experienced additive antitumor effects. Treatment activities of 50 kBq/kg were without toxicity but induced insufficient antitumor response in these high-tumor-burden patients. Remarkable antitumor activity by means of objective radiologic response or tumor marker decline was observed in 9 of 11 evaluable patients.

There were significantly more female patients with a BAP1 mutation than females in the overall cohort (P = 0.001).  Conclusions:   Mutations in BAP1 negatively affected OS, whereas SETD2 and KDM5C mutations were associated with prolonged OS in our pooled cohort of 167 patients with metastatic ccRCC.

Objective:   To investigate the clinical significance of oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS) glycosaminoglycan chains in cisplatin-resistant MIBC and to evaluate these as targets for second-line therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   An ofCS-binding recombinant VAR2CSA protein derived from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (rVAR2) was used as an in situ, in vitro, and in vivo ofCS-targeting reagent in cisplatin-resistant MIBC. The ofCS expression landscape was analyzed in two independent cohorts of matched pre- and post-NAC-treated MIBC patients.  Intervention:   An rVAR2 protein armed with cytotoxic hemiasterlin compounds (rVAR2 drug conjugate [VDC] 886) was evaluated as a novel therapeutic strategy in a xenograft model of cisplatin-resistant MIBC.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Antineoplastic effects of targeting ofCS.  Results and limitations:   In situ, ofCS was significantly overexpressed in residual tumors after NAC in two independent patient cohorts (p<0.02). Global gene-expression profiling and biochemical analysis of primary tumors and cell lines revealed syndican-1 and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 as ofCS-modified proteoglycans in MIBC. In vitro, ofCS was expressed on all MIBC cell lines tested, and VDC886 eliminated these cells in the low-nanomolar IC50 concentration range. In vivo, VDC886 effectively retarded growth of chemoresistant orthotopic bladder cancer xenografts and prolonged survival (p=0.005). The use of cisplatin only for the generation of chemoresistant xenografts are limitations of our animal model design.  Conclusions:   Targeting ofCS provides a promising second-line treatment strategy in cisplatin-resistant MIBC.  Patient summary:   Cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer overexpresses particular sugar chains compared with chemotherapy-naïve bladder cancer. Using a recombinant protein from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, we can target these sugar chains, and our results showed a significant antitumor effect in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer.

Objective:   To identify a molecular subgroup of prostate cancers with metastatic potential at presentation resulting in a high risk of recurrence following radical prostatectomy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using gene expression data from 70 primary resections, 31 metastatic lymph nodes, and 25 normal prostate samples. Independent assay validation was performed using 322 radical prostatectomy samples from four sites with a mean follow-up of 50.3 months.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Molecular subgroups were identified using unsupervised hierarchical clustering. A partial least squares approach was used to generate a gene expression assay. Relationships with outcome (time to biochemical and metastatic recurrence) were analysed using multivariable Cox regression and log-rank analysis.  Results and limitations:   A molecular subgroup of primary prostate cancer with biology similar to metastatic disease was identified. A 70-transcript signature (metastatic assay) was developed and independently validated in the radical prostatectomy samples. Metastatic assay positive patients had increased risk of biochemical recurrence (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] 1.62 [1.13-2.33]; p=0.0092) and metastatic recurrence (multivariable HR=3.20 [1.76-5.80]; p=0.0001). A combined model with Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment post surgical (CAPRA-S) identified patients at an increased risk of biochemical and metastatic recurrence superior to either model alone (HR=2.67 [1.90-3.75]; p<0.0001 and HR=7.53 [4.13-13.73]; p<0.0001, respectively). The retrospective nature of the study is acknowledged as a potential limitation.  Conclusions:   The metastatic assay may identify a molecular subgroup of primary prostate cancers with metastatic potential.

The aim of this study was to elucidate utilization trends of conventional radiation, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), brachytherapy, proton radiotherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) using a large convenience sample of irradiated patients with cancer identified from private insurance claims in the United States. The unit of analysis was a claim corresponding to a fraction of delivered radiotherapy from 2008 to 2014. Each claim was assigned a disease site on the basis of the diagnosis code and a radiation technology on the basis of the procedure code. In 2014, conventional radiation and IMRT constituted 56% and 39% of all radiation treatment claims, respectively, while brachytherapy constituted 2%, proton radiotherapy 1%, SBRT 1%, and SRS <1%. Compared with the first quarter of 2008, the proportional contribution of conventional radiation and brachytherapy to all radiation claims each decreased by 16% in the fourth quarter of 2014. In contrast, proportional contribution increased by 32% for IMRT, 83% for proton radiotherapy, 124% for SRS, and 309% for SBRT. Prostate cancer constituted 60% of all proton claims in 2008 but declined to 37% by 2014. SBRT was used to treat a variety of disease sites, most commonly primary lung (25%), prostate (12%), secondary bone (9%), and secondary lung (9%), in 2014. In this claims-based analysis of younger patients with private insurance, conventional radiation and IMRT were the most commonly used technologies from 2008 to 2014, while SBRT showed the most robust growth over the study period.""","""['Hubert Y Pan', 'Jing Jiang', 'Ya-Chen Tina Shih', 'Benjamin D Smith']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Am Coll Radiol""","""['Photon and Proton Radiation Therapy Utilization in a Population of More Than 100 Million Commercially Insured Patients.', 'National Cancer Data Base analysis of radiation therapy consolidation modality for cervical cancer: the impact of new technological advancements.', 'Comparative Toxicities and Cost of Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy, Proton Radiation, and Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Among Younger Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer-a review.', 'What is the best way to radiate the prostate in 2016?', 'Physics and biomedical challenges of cancer therapy with accelerated heavy ions.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Models of Proton Therapy for Head and Neck: Evaluating Quality and Methods to Date.', 'Multiple Computed Tomography Robust Optimization to Account for Random Anatomic Density Variations During Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy.', 'Clinical utilization of radiation therapy in Korea, 2016.', 'Patterns of stereotactic body radiation therapy: The influence of lung cancer treatment on prostate cancer treatment.']"""

However, to the authors' knowledge, data regarding the cancer burden in this group are lacking, which would inform targeted cancer prevention and control.  Methods:   The authors calculated age-standardized proportional incidence ratios (PIRs) comparing the frequency of the top 15 cancers in ABs with that of US-born non-Hispanic blacks (USBs) by sex and region of birth using incidence data for 2000 through 2012 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER 17) program.  Results:   Compared with USBs, ABs had significantly higher PIRs of infection-related cancers (liver, stomach, and Kaposi sarcoma), blood cancers (leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), prostate cancer, and thyroid cancers (females only). For example, the PIR for Kaposi sarcoma in AB versus USB women was 12.06 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.23-18.90). In contrast, ABs had lower PIRs for smoking-related and colorectal cancers (eg, for lung cancer among men, the PIR was 0.30 [95% CI, 0.27-0.34]). Furthermore, cancer occurrence in ABs versus USBs varied by region of birth. For example, the higher PIRs for liver cancer noted among male ABs (PIR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.79-5.35) and for thyroid cancer in female ABs (PIR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.03-4.02) were confined to Eastern African-born blacks, whereas the higher PIR for prostate cancer (PIR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.78, 2.02) was confined to Western African-born blacks.  Conclusions:   The cancer incidence profile of ABs is different from that of USBs and varies by region of birth, suggesting differences in environmental, cultural, social, and genetic factors.

FK-A11 showed in vivo antitumor activity by both i.v. and i.p. administration in a dose-dependent manner. In both xenograft models, FK-A11 showed superior antitumor effects compared to other depsipeptide analogs in accordance with in vitro anti-cell proliferation effects and the potency of HDAC/PI3K dual inhibition.

In order to characterize the survival of PCa patients, we compared patients' all-cause and cancer-specific mortalities between pre- and post-PSA periods by stage in Finland.  Material and methods:   All PCa cases diagnosed in Finland between 1985 and 2013 (N = 91,329) were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry (FCR). PCa stage at diagnosis was defined as localized, local node positive or metastasized. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), and relative and cause-specific survival were assessed by stage and introduction of PSA testing. The main limitation was the high proportion of men with unknown stage (28%).  Results:   A clear decreasing trend in the SMR of PCa patients was evident when pre- and post-PSA eras were compared: for localized PCa, the SMR was 1.43 (95%CI 1.38-1.48) in 1985-1989 and 0.98 (95%CI 0.95-1.01) in 2000-2004, and for metastasized PCa, the SMRs were 4.51 (95%CI 4.30-4.72) and 3.01 (95%CI 2.89-3.12), respectively. Difference between cause-specific and relative survival was pronounced in localized PCa in post-PSA period: 10-year relative survival was 94.6% (95%CI 91.4-97.8) and cause-specific 84.2% (95%CI 82.9-85.5%). In metastasized PCa the difference was not that significant.  Conclusions:   From 1985 to 2009, the SMR among men diagnosed with PCa decreased significantly in Finland. Among men with localized PCa, the SMR decreased even below that of the Finnish male population.

This risk seems to be different for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists leuprolide and goserelin and GnRH antagonists, whereas the slightly more expensive GnRH antagonist shows a beneficial risk profile. The present study assesses the cost effectiveness of degarelix compared to leuprolide for PCa patients with increased CV risk.  Methods:   This analysis is based on a pooled analysis of six phase III, randomized, controlled trials comparing the GnRH agonists leuprolide and goserelin with the GnRH antagonist degarelix. For the combined endpoint of CV events or death a superiority of degarelix was determined with a Number-Needed-to-Treat of 12. From the perspective of German statutory health insurance, this evaluation estimates and compares the additional drug costs of degarelix treatment to the cost of one (avoided) CV event. The CV event costs were estimated via emergency treatment and transportation, inpatient treatment, and rehabilitation. The difference of these two cost pools divided by 12 yields the average saving per patient and year.  Results:   For every 12 PCa patients with CV history that are treated with GnRH antagonists to prevent one CV event, there will be additional drug costs in comparison with leuprolide treatment of € 3111 per year. Costs of € 8447 per year are prevented. Therefore, each patient with a history of CV who is treated with degarelix instead of a leuprolide generates savings of € 445 per patient and year.

They are currently investigated in several clinical trials of cancer immunotherapy but so far, their tumor infiltration has not been systematically explored across human cancers. Novel algorithms allowing the deconvolution of bulk tumor transcriptomes to find the relative proportions of infiltrating leucocytes, such as CIBERSORT, should be appropriate for this aim but in practice they fail to accurately recognize γδ T lymphocytes. Here, by implementing machine learning from microarray data, we first improved the computational identification of blood-derived TCRVγ9Vδ2+ γδ lymphocytes and then applied this strategy to assess their abundance as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (γδ TIL) in ∼10,000 cancer biopsies from 50 types of hematological and solid malignancies. We observed considerable inter-individual variation of TCRVγ9Vδ2+γδ TIL abundance both within each type and across the spectrum of cancers tested. We report their prominence in B cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3-AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as well as in inflammatory breast, prostate, esophagus, pancreas and lung carcinoma. Across all cancers, the abundance of αβ TILs and TCRVγ9Vδ2+ γδ TILs did not correlate. αβ TIL abundance paralleled the mutational load of tumors and positively correlated with inflammation, infiltration of monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DC), antigen processing and presentation, and cytolytic activity, in line with an association with a favorable outcome. In contrast, the abundance of TCRVγ9Vδ2+ γδ TILs did not correlate with these hallmarks and was variably associated with outcome, suggesting that distinct contexts underlie TCRVγ9Vδ2+ γδ TIL and αβ TIL mobilizations in cancer.""","""['Marie Tosolini', 'Frédéric Pont', 'Mary Poupot', 'François Vergez', 'Marie-Laure Nicolau-Travers', 'David Vermijlen', 'Jean-Emmanuel Sarry', 'Francesco Dieli', 'Jean-Jacques Fournié']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['Killing of laminin receptor-positive human lung cancers by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes bearing gammadelta(+) t-cell receptors.', 'γδ T-cell Receptors Derived from Breast Cancer-Infiltrating T Lymphocytes Mediate Antitumor Reactivity.', 'BTN3A1-antibodies and phosphoantigens: TCRVγ9Vδ2 ""see"" the difference.', 'Tumor-Infiltrating γδ T Lymphocytes: Pathogenic Role, Clinical Significance, and Differential Programing in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Deciphering human γδ T cell response in cancer: Lessons from tumor-infiltrating γδ T cells.', 'T Cells in Colorectal Cancer: Unravelling the Function of Different T Cell Subsets in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Multimodal hierarchical classification of CITE-seq data delineates immune cell states across lineages and tissues.', 'Prognostic Immune Effector Signature in Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Patients Is Dominated by γδ T Cells.', 'Breast Cancer Stem Cell-Derived Tumors Escape from γδ T-cell Immunosurveillance In Vivo by Modulating γδ T-cell Ligands.', 'T Cell Based Immunotherapy for Cancer: Approaches and Strategies.']"""

The primary active metabolite of EXE, 17-hydroexemestane (17-HE), is inactivated via glucuronidation, mainly by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B17 (UGT2B17). UGT2B17 also has a primary role in inactivation of endogenous androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone and may play an important role in regulation of breast and prostate tumor intracrinology. We recently reported that UGT2B17 could be induced by both estrogenic and androgenic ligands in breast cancer cells via binding of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) or the androgen receptor (AR) to a complex regulatory unit in the proximal UGT2B17 promoter. In this study we show that both EXE and 17-HE increase UGT2B17 mRNA levels in breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells, and increase glucuronidation of UGT2B17 substrates, including 17-HE and androsterone. Using antagonists of ERα and AR as well as inhibition mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) we demonstrate that EXE and 17-HE induce UGT2B17 expression primarily via the AR. This result is consistent with previous reports that 17-HE can act as an AR ligand. In vitro studies suggest that multiple steroid-responsive DNA elements within the proximal promoter are involved in the response to 17-HE-liganded AR. The up-regulation of UGT2B17 by EXE and 17-HE in breast cancer cells might enhance the local metabolism of 17-HE as well as that of endogenous androgens, hence impacting potentially on treatment outcomes.""","""['Apichaya Chanawong', 'Peter I Mackenzie', 'Ross A McKinnon', 'Dong Gui Hu', 'Robyn Meech']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Impact of UGT2B17 Gene Deletion on the Pharmacokinetics of 17-Hydroexemestane in Healthy Volunteers.', 'Characterization of 17-dihydroexemestane glucuronidation: potential role of the UGT2B17 deletion in exemestane pharmacogenetics.', 'Androgen and Estrogen Receptors in Breast Cancer Coregulate Human UDP-Glucuronosyltransferases 2B15 and 2B17.', 'Multiple roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)2B15 and UGT2B17 enzymes in androgen metabolism and prostate cancer evolution.', 'Characterization and regulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in steroid target tissues.']"""

In our study we want to compare the surgical margin positivity rates for retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) and robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RALP) and investigate the factors affecting surgical margin positivity in RALP.  Materials and methods:   Data from 78 RRP and 62 RALP patients operated from 2011 May to 2016 March were retrospectively screened. Patients in both groups were compared in terms of age, postop hematocrit reduction, hospital stay, duration of follow-up, surgical margin positivity, biochemical recurrence and oncologic parameters. In RALP group it was searched the relationship between the surgical margin positivity and prostate specific antigen (PSA), positive biopsy core, biopsy Gleason scoring, pathologic stage and Gleason scoring, lymph node positivity, lymphovascular and perineural invasion, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, prostate weight.  Results:   Patients in the RALP group had lower postop hematocrit reduction and shorter hospital stay (p &lt; 0.001). There was no difference in surgical margin positivity between RALP and RRP groups (37.1% vs. 29.5%, p = 0.341).

Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF) is an anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor factor. We previously showed that PEDF induces macrophages recruitment in vitro, correlates with macrophages density in human prostate, and stimulates macrophages polarization towards the classically activated pathway. Here, we demonstrate that PEDF modulates the interaction between macrophages and PCa cells through a bidirectional signalling leading to tumor cell apoptosis and phagocytosis.  Methods:   RAW 264.7 and THP-1 cells, and BMDMs were grown in vitro as mono- or co-cultures with PC3 or CL1 tumor cells. The effects of PEDF and its derived P18 peptide were measured on macrophages differentiation, migration, and superoxide production, and tumor cell apoptosis and phagocytosis. PEDF receptors (ATP5B, PNPLA2, and LRP6) and CD47 mRNA and protein expression were quantified in macrophages and tumor cells by quantitative RT-PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry.  Results:   We found that PEDF induced the migration of macrophages towards tumor 3D spheroids and 2D cultures. In co-culture, PEDF increased PCa cells phagocytosis through an indirect apoptosis-dependent mechanism. Moreover, PEDF stimulated the production of superoxide by macrophages. Conditioned media from macrophages exposed to PEDF induced tumor cells apoptosis in contrast to control conditioned media suggesting that ROS may be involved in tumor cells apoptosis. ATP5B and PNPLA2 PEDF receptors on macrophages and CD47 on tumor cells were respectively up- and down-regulated by PEDF. As PEDF, blocking CD47 induced phagocytosis. Inhibiting ATP5B reduced phagocytosis. Inversely, PNPLA2 inhibition blocks differentiation but maintains phagocytosis. CD47-induced phagocytosis was partially reverted by ATP5B inhibition suggesting a complementary action. Similar effects were observed with P18 PEDF-derived peptide.  Conclusions:   These data established that modulating the molecular interactions between macrophages and PCa cells using PEDF may be a promising strategy for PCa treatment.""","""['Dalia Martinez-Marin', 'Courtney Jarvis', 'Thomas Nelius', 'Werner de Riese', 'Olga V Volpert', 'Stéphanie Filleur']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cabazitaxel regimens inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells and enhances the anti-tumor properties of PEDF with various efficacy and toxicity.', 'Pigment epithelium-derived factor induces THP-1 macrophage apoptosis and necrosis by the induction of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.', 'Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor and its Phosphomimetic Mutant Induce JNK-Dependent Apoptosis and P38-Mediated Migration Arrest.', 'In vitro and in vivo biological activity of PEDF against a range of tumors.', 'PEDF: an endogenous factor displaying potent neuroprotective, neurotrophic, and antiangiogenic activity.', 'Collagen type I alters the proteomic signature of macrophages in a collagen morphology-dependent manner.', 'NANO-SBT-PEDF delivery system: A promising approach against ovarian cancer?', 'The Role of Tumor Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Macrophage Crosstalk in Cancer Progression.', 'Pigment epithelium-derived factor promotes peritoneal dissemination of ovarian cancer through induction of immunosuppressive macrophages.', 'CD206+ tumor-associated macrophages cross-present tumor antigen and drive antitumor immunity.']"""

Mechanistic analysis revealed that PKCε overexpression and Pten loss individually and synergistically upregulate the production of the chemokine CXCL13, which involves the transcriptional activation of the CXCL13 gene via the non-canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. Notably, targeted disruption of CXCL13 or its receptor, CXCR5, in prostate cancer cells impaired their migratory and tumorigenic properties.

Many currently available assays use whole urine or cell pellets for the analysis of prostate cancer-associated genes, although the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has also recently been of interest. We investigated the expression of prostate-, kidney-, and bladder-specific transcripts and known prostate cancer biomarkers in urine EVs.  Methods:   Cell pellets and EVs were recovered from post-DRE urine specimens, with the total RNA yield and quality determined by Bioanalyzer. The levels of prostate, kidney, and bladder-associated transcripts in EVs were assessed by TaqMan qPCR and targeted sequencing.  Results:   RNA was more consistently recovered from the urine EV specimens, with over 80% of the patients demonstrating higher RNA yields in the EV fraction as compared to urine cell pellets. The median EV RNA yield of 36.4 ng was significantly higher than the median urine cell pellet RNA yield of 4.8 ng. Analysis of the post-DRE urine EVs indicated that prostate-specific transcripts were more abundant than kidney- or bladder-specific transcripts. Additionally, patients with prostate cancer had significantly higher levels of the prostate cancer-associated genes PCA3 and ERG.

Active Surveillance (AS) has emerged as a way to mitigate this problem, by delaying treatment of men, who are at low-risk until this becomes necessary. However, it is not known after how much time or biopsy rounds should patients stop AS and transition to conservative management (CM), if no progression is detected.  Methods:   We used a microsimulation model with natural history of prostate cancer based on ERSPC and SEER data. We modeled referral to treatment while in AS, based on Johns Hopkins treatment-free survival data. We projected lifetime costs and effects of AS (and radical treatment, if progression is detected) under different biopsy follow-up schedules compared to CM, where radical treatment only occurs when men would be clinically diagnosed in absence of screening.  Results:   For men with low-risk disease in younger age groups (55-65), AS is cost-effective for up to 7 yearly biopsy rounds. For men older than 65, even one biopsy round results in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, though it may result in QALYs gained for men without previous screening. For men with intermediate-risk disease AS is cost-effective even for men in 65-75 age group.  Conclusions:   The benefit of AS when compared to CM is strongly dependent on life expectancy and disease risk.

Change in % interval days to radical prostatectomy was evaluated by multivariate analysis including distance to nearest surgical robot, age, comorbidity, hospital volume, operation type, hospital academic status, bed volume and temporal progress.  Results:   % Interval days to radical prostatectomy became wider for distance to nearest surgical robot <30 km. When a surgical robot emerged within 30 and 10 km, the prostatectomy caseload in non-robot hospitals reduced by 13 and 18% within 6 months, respectively, while the robot hospitals gained +101% caseload (P < 0.01 for all) Multivariate analyses including 9759 open and 5052 non-robotic minimally invasive radical prostatectomies in 483 non-robot hospitals revealed a significant inverse association between distance to nearest surgical robot and % interval days to radical prostatectomy (B = -17.3% for distance to nearest surgical robot ≥30 km and -11.7% for 10-30 km versus distance to nearest surgical robot <10 km), while younger age, high-volume hospital, open-prostatectomy provider and temporal progress were other significant factors related to % interval days to radical prostatectomy widening (P < 0.05 for all).  Conclusions:   Robotic surgery accessibility within 30 km would make patients less likely select conventional surgery. The nearer a robot was, the faster the caseload reduction was.""","""['Toru Sugihara', 'Hideo Yasunaga', 'Hiroki Matsui', 'Go Nagao', 'Akira Ishikawa', 'Tetsuya Fujimura', 'Hiroshi Fukuhara', 'Kiyohide Fushimi', 'Makoto Ohori', 'Yukio Homma']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Jpn J Clin Oncol""","""['Robot-assisted versus other types of radical prostatectomy: population-based safety and cost comparison in Japan, 2012-2013.', 'High volume is the key for improving in-hospital outcomes after radical prostatectomy: a total population analysis in Germany from 2006 to 2013.', 'Health Economic Analysis of Open and Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Surgery for Prostate Cancer Within the Prospective Multicentre LAPPRO Trial.', 'Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Surgical Tolerability and Frailty in Elderly Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Narrative Review.', 'Safe surgery in the elderly: A review of outcomes following robotic proctectomy from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample in a cross-sectional study.', 'Impact of a robotic surgical system on treatment choice for men with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer.']"""

There is a recognized potential for misclassification of RtB when using claims data. We compared alternative measures of RtB to better understand their impact on SRE prevalence and SRE-related mortality.  Methods and materials:   We analyzed data for stage IV prostate cancer (PCa) cases identified between 2005 and 2009 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry linked with Medicare claims. We created two measures of RtB: 1) a literature-based measure requiring the presence of a prior claim with a BM code; 2) a new measure requiring either that the BM code coincided with the radiation episode or that the duration of the radiation episode was less than or equal to 4 weeks. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios of an SRE using both measures among stratified samples: no metastasis (M0), metastasis to bone (M1b) and other sites (M1c).  Results:   The study sample included 5,074 men with stage IV PCa (median age 77 years), of whom 22% had M0, 54% had M1b, and 24% had M1c disease at time of PCa diagnosis. Based on Approaches 1 and 2, the proportion with probable RtB was 5% and 8% among M0, 30% and 30% among M1b, and 25% and 27% among M1c patients. Among M0 patients, the adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) associated with an SRE was 1.27 when using Approach 1 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.95-1.7) and 1.49 when using Approach 2 (95% CI: 1.14-1.96). However, the impact of SREs on mortality did not differ between both approaches among M1b and M1c patients.  Conclusion:   We found that alternative measures used to define RtB as SRE in claims data impact conclusions regarding the effect of SREs on mortality among M0 but not M1 patients.""","""['Eberechukwu Onukwugha', 'Young Kwok', 'Jay P Ciezki', 'Candice Yong', 'Catherine Plaisant', 'Chandana A Reddy', 'C Daniel Mullins', 'Brian Seal', 'Adriana Valderrama', 'Arif Hussain']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Mortality following bone metastasis and skeletal-related events among men with prostate cancer: a population-based analysis of US Medicare beneficiaries, 1999-2006.', 'Physician visits and the timing of skeletal-related events among men newly diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer: A cohort analysis.', 'Skeletal-related events and mortality among older men with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and economic burden of bone metastasis and skeletal-related events in prostate cancer.', 'Burden of skeletal-related events in prostate cancer: unmet need in pain improvement.', 'An Approach to Identify Delivery of Palliative Radiation Therapy Using Health Care Claims Data: A Proof-of-Concept Application of a Visual Analytics Tool.', 'Prevalence and risk of skeletal complications and use of radiation therapy in elderly women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer.']"""

In most cases, the causes are unknown and, most importantly, there are no reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. The search for sensitive biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis of clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) is currently a fast growing field. We carried out proteomics analysis of 93 urinary samples of healthy subjects (HS) and patients affected by ccRCC, prostate cancer (PCa) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), that was able to successfully distinguish each group.The most significant candidate biomarker was identified by mass spectrometry as Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP), a key regulator of cell signaling, already described in several cancer types as a metastasis suppressor. By combining ELISA, immunoblotting and tissue microarray, we demonstrated that, in ccRCC, urinary excretion of RKIP and its phosphorylated form (p-RKIP) reflected the tissue expression of these putative biomarkers. Baseline urinary RKIP, evaluated in an independent cohort of 56 ccRCC patients and 28 HS, successfully distinguished both groups and, most importantly, a cut-off value of 10 ng/mg/g Pr/uCr enabled a highly accurate prediction of Cancer-specific survival and Progression-free survival. Furthermore, p-RKIP was totally undetectable in both tissue and urine samples of ccRCC, showing a great potential for diagnostics purposes.Our data indicate that urinary RKIP encompasses both the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated form and that their combined evaluation can help in the diagnosis and prognosis of ccRCC.""","""['Massimo Papale', 'Grazia Vocino', 'Giuseppe Lucarelli', 'Monica Rutigliano', 'Margherita Gigante', 'Maria Teresa Rocchetti', 'Francesco Pesce', 'Francesca Sanguedolce', 'Pantaleo Bufo', 'Michele Battaglia', 'Giovanni Stallone', 'Giuseppe Grandaliano', 'Giuseppe Carrieri', 'Loreto Gesualdo', 'Elena Ranieri']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Searching for prognostic biomarkers for small renal masses in the urinary proteome.', 'ARCHITECT®\xa0urine-neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (u-NGAL) assay as new prognostic marker for clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) (preliminary results).', 'Reduced expression of Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein in renal cell carcinoma: a significant prognostic marker.', 'Diagnostic and prognostic tissuemarkers in clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinoma.', 'Survey of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) in multiple cancer types.', 'Raf kinase inhibitor protein combined with phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase offers valuable prognosis in gastrointestinal stromal tumor.', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Renal Cell Carcinoma: Molecular Basis and Rationale for Their Use in Clinical Practice.', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma as a Metabolic Disease: An Update on Main Pathways, Potential Biomarkers, and Therapeutic Targets.', 'MUC1 Tissue Expression and Its Soluble Form CA15-3 Identify a Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma with Distinct Metabolic Profile and Poor Clinical Outcome.', 'Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers in Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   A group of 182 consecutively registered patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 6 underwent MRI and radical prostatectomy. Clinically significant cancer was surgically defined as Gleason score of 7 or greater, tumor volume of 0.5 cm3 or greater, or tumor category T3 or greater. Clinical parameters (prostate-specific antigen level, greatest percentage of biopsy core, and percentage of positive cores) and the PI-RADSv2 ratings by three independent readers (experienced readers 1 and 2, inexperienced reader 3) were investigated. Cutoffs and the diagnostic performance of PI-RADSv2 for clinically significant cancer were analyzed.  Results:   Clinically significant cancer was found in 87.4% (159/182) of patients. The cutoff PI-RADSv2 score for clinically significant cancer was 4 for readers 1 and 2 and 5 for reader 3. The AUCs were 0.829 and 0.853 for readers 1 and 2 (p < 0.001) and 0.602 for reader 3 (p = 0.067). For reader 1, sensitivity was 89.9% (143/159); specificity, 69.6% (16/23); positive predictive value, 95.3% (143/150); negative predictive value, 50.0% (16/32); and accuracy, 87.4% (159/182).

Subjects and methods:   The Prostate Cancer database Sweden (PCBaSe) was used to obtain data on men with T2DM and PCa (n = 2210) for comparison with data on men with PCa only (n = 23 071). All men had intermediate- (T1-2, Gleason score 7 and/or prostate-specific antigen [PSA] 10-20 ng/mL) or high-risk (T3 and/or Gleason score 8-10 and/or PSA 20-50 ng/mL) localized PCa diagnosed between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2014. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for receipt of curative treatment in men with and without T2DM. Overall survival, for up to 8 years of follow-up, was calculated both for men with T2DM only and for men with T2DM and PCa.  Results:   Men with T2DM were less likely to receive curative treatment for PCa than men without T2DM (OR 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.69-0.87). The 8-year overall survival rates were 79% and 33% for men with T2DM and high-risk PCa who did and did not receive curative treatment, respectively.

Furthermore, we delineated the relationships for beverage-specific intakes of beer, red wine, white wine and spirits.  Results:   The study included 1282 APC cases and 951 controls. Beer intake frequency of ⩾5 days per week was associated with increased risk compared with no beer intake (odds ratio=1.66, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-2.48) whereas wine was protective at all frequencies of consumption compared with those with no wine intake.

Methods:   The Johns Hopkins AS program monitors men with favorable-risk prostate cancer with serial PSA, digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate magnetic resonance imaging and prostate biopsy. Since 2007, post-DRE urinary specimens have also been routinely obtained. Men with multiple PCA3 measures obtained over ⩾3 years of monitoring were included. Utility of first PCA3 score (fPCA3), subsequent PCA3 (sPCA3) and change in PCA3 were assessed for prediction of Gleason grade reclassification (GR, Gleason score >6) during follow-up.  Results:   In total, 260 men met study criteria. Median time from enrollment to fPCA3 was 2 years (interquartile range (IQR) 1-3) and from fPCA3 to sPCA3 was 5 years (IQR 4-6). During median follow-up of 6 years (IQR 5-8), 28 men (11%) underwent GR. Men with GR had higher median fPCA3 (48.0 vs 24.5, P=0.007) and sPCA3 (63.5 vs 36.0, P=0.002) than those without GR, while longitudinal change in PCA3 did not differ by GR status (log-normalized rate 0.07 vs 0.06, P=0.53). In a multivariable model including age, risk classification and PSA density, fPCA3 remained significantly associated with GR (log(fPCA3) odds ratio=1.77, P=0.04).  Conclusions:   PCA3 scores obtained during AS were higher in men who underwent GR, but the rate of change in PCA3 over time did not differ by GR status. PCA3 was a significant predictor of GR in a multivariable model including conventional risk factors, suggesting that PCA3 provides incremental prognostic information in the AS setting.""","""['J J Tosoian', 'H D Patel', 'M Mamawala', 'P Landis', 'S Wolf', 'D J Elliott', 'J I Epstein', 'H B Carter', 'A E Ross', 'L J Sokoll', 'C P Pavlovich']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Prostate cancer: PCA3 as a Grade Reclassification Predictor.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG Plus PCA3 for Individualized Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment.', 'Accuracy of PCA3 measurement in predicting short-term biopsy progression in an active surveillance program.', 'Urinary PCA3 as a predictor of prostate cancer in a cohort of 3,073 men undergoing initial prostate biopsy.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 as a Tumour Marker: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects.', 'Is Active Surveillance Too Active?', 'Molecular Biomarkers for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Clinical Applications of Liquid Biopsy in Prostate Cancer: From Screening to Predictive Biomarker.', 'Association of MyProstateScore (MPS) with prostate cancer grade in the radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Biomarker in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

However, the role of SENP1 in regulating deSUMOylation of TGF-β/SMADs signaling is unknown. In this study, we developed a lentiviral vector, PLKO.1-shSENP1, to silence SENP1 in prostate cancer cells with high metastatic characteristics (PC3M). Likewise, we also created an adenovirus vector, Ad5/F11p-SENP1 to over-express SENP1 in prostate cancer cells with low metastatic potential (LNCaP). We showed that silencing of SENP1 promoted cellular apoptosis, and inhibited proliferation and migration of PC3M cells. Moreover, SENP1 silencing increased the SMAD4 expression at protein level, up-regulated E-cadherin and down-regulated Vimentin expression, indicating the inhibition of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, SMAD4 interference abolished SENP1-mediated up-regulation of E-cadherin, suggesting that SENP1 regulated E-cadherin expression via SMAD4. SENP1 over-expression in LNCaP cells reduced SMAD4 protein, and promoted EMT via decreasing E-cadherin and increasing Vimentin. Moreover, down-regulation of SMAD4 and E-cadherin were blocked, after transfection with two SUMOylation sites mutated SMAD4, suggesting that SENP1 might reduce SMAD4 levels to regulate E-cadherin expression via deSUMOylation of SMAD4. In conclusion, SENP1 deSUMOylated SMAD4 to promote EMT via up-regulating E-cadherin in prostate cancer cells. Therefore, SENP1 is a potential target for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaoyan Zhang', 'Hao Wang', 'Hua Wang', 'Fengjun Xiao', 'Prem Seth', 'Weidong Xu', 'Qinghua Jia', 'Chutse Wu', 'Yuefeng Yang', 'Lisheng Wang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['MicroRNA-539 functions as a tumour suppressor in prostate cancer via the TGF-β/Smad4 signalling pathway by down-regulating DLX1.', 'SENP1 regulates hepatocyte growth factor-induced migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Valproic acid (VPA) inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate carcinoma via the dual suppression of SMAD4.', 'Role of desumoylation in the development of prostate cancer.', 'Recent research and development of inhibitors targeting sentrin-specific protease 1 for the treatment of cancers.', 'Possible molecular mechanisms underlying the development of atherosclerosis in cancer survivors.', 'Knockdown SENP1 Suppressed the Angiogenic Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Impacting CXCR4-Regulated MRTF-A SUMOylation and CCN1 Expression.', 'Circular RNA circ_0089153 acts as a competing endogenous RNA to regulate colorectal cancer development by the miR-198/SUMO-specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) axis.', 'Hypoxia protects H9c2 cells against Ferroptosis through SENP1-mediated protein DeSUMOylation.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Discrete choice experiments allow health care researchers to study the preferences of individual patients by eliciting trade-offs between different aspects of health-related quality of life. However, many discrete choice experiments yield data with incomplete ranking information and sparsity due to the limited number of choice sets presented to each patient, making it challenging to estimate patient preferences. Moreover, methods to identify outliers in discrete choice data are lacking. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical random effects rank-ordered multinomial logit model for discrete choice data. Missing ranks are accounted for by marginalizing over all possible permutations of unranked alternatives to estimate individual patient preferences, which are modeled as a function of patient covariates. We provide a Bayesian version of relative attribute importance, and adapt the use of the conditional predictive ordinate to identify outlying choice sets and outlying individuals with unusual preferences compared to the population.

RM2 is a gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) antagonist that binds to GRPr on PCa cells. Recent studies suggest that GRPr imaging with PET/CT is a promising technique for staging and restaging of PCa. We explore the value of GRPr-PET using the 68Ga-labeled GRPr antagonist RM2 in a selected population of patients with biochemically recurrent PCa and a negative/inconclusive 18FECH-PET/CT.  Material and methods:   In this retrospective study 16 men with biochemical PCa relapse and negative (n = 14) or inconclusive (n = 2) 18FECH-PET/CT underwent whole-body 68Ga-RM2-PET/CT. Mean time from 18FECH-PET/CT to 68Ga-RM2-PET/CT was 6.1 ± 6.8 months. Primary therapies in these patients were radical prostatectomy (n = 13; 81.3%) or radiotherapy (n = 3; 18.7%). 14/16 patients (87.5%) had already undergone salvage therapies because of biochemical relapse prior to 68Ga-RM2-PET/CT imaging. Mean ± SD PSA at 68Ga-RM2-PET/CT was 19.4 ± 53.5 ng/ml (range 1.06-226.4 ng/ml).  Results: 68Ga-RM2-PET/CT showed at least one region with focal pathological uptake in 10/16 patients (62.5%), being suggestive of local relapse (n = 4), lymph node metastases (LNM; n = 4), bone metastases (n = 1) and lung metastasis with hilar LNM (n = 1). Seven of ten positive 68Ga-RM2 scans were positively confirmed by surgical resection and histology of the lesions (n = 2), by response to site-directed therapies (n = 2) or by further imaging (n = 3). Patients with a positive 68Ga-RM2-scan showed a significantly higher median PSA (6.8 ng/ml, IQR 10.2 ng/ml) value than those with a negative scan (1.5 ng/ml, IQR 3.1 ng/ml; p = 0.016). Gleason scores or concomitant antihormonal therapy had no apparent impact on the detection of recurrent disease.  Conclusion:   Even in this highly selected population of patients with known biochemical recurrence but negative or inconclusive 18FECH-PET/CT, a 68Ga-RM2-PET/CT was helpful to localize PCa recurrence in the majority of the cases.

Recently, PSA is discovered in non-prostatic cancer tissues in men and women raising doubts about its specificity for prostatic tissues. PSA exists in low serum level in healthy men and in higher levels in many prostate disorders, including prostatitis and prostate cancer. Thus, a supplementary tumor marker is needed to accurately diagnose the cancer and to observe the patient after treatment. Recently, soluble human leukocyte antigen-G (sHLA-G) has been introduced as a new tumor marker for different cancer types, including colorectal, breast, lung, and ovary. The present descriptive-experimental study was carried out including patients with malignant prostate tumor, patients with benign prostate tumor, and a group of health men as the control group, as judged by an oncologist as well as a pathologist. After sterile blood sampling, sHLA-G was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in each group. The data was then analyzed using one-way ANOVA. P≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The results showed that the mean of sHLA-G level was high in patients.

The use of Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors (ACEIs) to manage hypertension in cancer patients is correlated with improved survival outcomes for renal, prostate, breast and small cell lung cancer. Previous studies demonstrate that the Angiotensin Receptor Type I (AT1R) is linked to breast cancer pathogenesis, with unbiased analysis of gene-expression studies identifying significant up-regulation of AGTR1, the gene encoding AT1R in ER+ve/HER2-ve tumors correlating with poor prognosis. However, there is no evidence, so far, of the functional contribution of AT1R to breast tumorigenesis. We explored the potential therapeutic benefit of ARB in a carcinogen-induced mouse model of breast cancer and clarified the mechanisms associated with its success.Mammary tumors were induced with 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]antracene (DMBA) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in female wild type mice and the effects of the ARB, Losartan treatment assessed in a preventative setting (n = 15 per group). Tumor histopathology was characterised by immunohistochemistry, real-time qPCR to detect gene expression signatures, and tumor cytokine levels measured with quantitative bioplex assays. AT1R was detected with radiolabelled ligand binding assays in fresh frozen tumor samples.We showed that therapeutic inhibition of AT1R, with Losartan, resulted in a significant reduction in tumor burden; and no mammary tumor incidence in 20% of animals. We observed a significant reduction in tumor progression from DCIS to invasive cancer with Losartan treatment. This was associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation and a significant reduction in IL-6, pSTAT3 and TNFα levels. Analysis of tumor immune cell infiltrates, however, demonstrated no significant differences in the recruitment of lymphocytes or tumour-associated macrophages in Losartan or vehicle-treated mammary tumors.Analysis of AT1R expression with radiolabelled ligand binding assays in human breast cancer biopsies showed high AT1R levels in 30% of invasive ductal carcinomas analysed. Furthermore, analysis of the TCGA database identified that high AT1R expression to be associated with luminal breast cancer subtype.Our in vivo data and analysis of human invasive ductal carcinoma samples identify the AT1R is a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer, with the availability of a range of well-tolerated inhibitors currently used in clinics.

Objective:   To investigate, using high-quality epidemiologic data, whether initial radical therapy in men at high risk of disseminated prostate cancer improves survival.  Design, setting, and participants:   An observational population-based Swedish study from 1996 to 2010 of men at high risk of disseminated prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] >50) initially treated by radical therapy (radiation therapy [n=630] or radical prostatectomy [n=120]) or androgen deprivation therapy (n=17 602), and followed for up to 15 yr.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Prostate-cancer and other-cause mortality was estimated for the treatment groups. We also matched the two cohorts for grade, T stage, M stage, Charlson score, year of diagnosis, age, and PSA, and found androgen deprivation therapy patient matches for 575 of the radical therapy patients, and then repeated comparative effectiveness analyses.  Results and limitation:   Prostate-cancer mortality was substantially greater in the androgen deprivation therapy group compared with the radically treated one, in unmatched (9062/17 602 vs 86/750) and matched (177/575 vs 71/575) cohorts. Among matched cohorts, initial androgen deprivation therapy was associated with nearly three-fold higher hazard of prostate-cancer death compared with initial radical therapy (2.87; 95% confidence interval 2.16-3.82). Multiple sensitivity analyses suggested that the findings were robust, although the general limitations of nonrandomized studies remain. Further, the study cohort may have included men with both systemic and nonsystemic disease, as a sole eligibility criterion of PSA >50 was used.  Conclusions:   This large and comprehensive population-based study suggests that initial radical therapy in men at high risk of disseminated prostate cancer improves survival.  Patient summary:   This large Swedish study suggests that men with prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate benefit from treating the prostate itself with radiation therapy or surgery rather than treating the disease with hormones alone.""","""['Prasanna Sooriakumaran', 'Tommy Nyberg', 'Olof Akre', 'Anders Widmark', 'Freddie Hamdy', 'Markus Graefen', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Gunnar Steineck', 'N Peter Wiklund']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Local Therapy for Disseminated Prostate Cancer: Improved Outcomes or Biased Confounders?', 'Association of Radical Local Treatment with Mortality in Men with Very High-risk Prostate Cancer: A Semiecologic, Nationwide, Population-based Study.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Treatment of dyslipidaemia with statins has been challenging in people with HIV because of an increased potential for drug interactions due to competing cytochrome P450 metabolism between statins and commonly used antiretroviral agents. Neither pitavastatin nor pravastatin depend on cytochrome P450 for primary metabolism. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of pitavastatin versus pravastatin in adults with HIV and dyslipidaemia.  Methods:   In the INTREPID (HIV-infected patieNts and TREatment with PItavastatin vs pravastatin for Dyslipidemia) randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 4 trial (INTREPID, we recruited adults aged 18-70 years with controlled HIV (with CD4 counts >200 cells per μL and HIV-1 RNA <200 copies per mL) on antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months and dyslipidaemia (LDL cholesterol 3·4-5·7 mmol/L and triglycerides ≤4·5 mmol/L) from 45 sites in the USA and Puerto Rico. Patients being treated with darunavir, or who had homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or any condition causing secondary dyslipidaemia, or a history of statin intolerance, diabetes, or coronary artery disease were not eligible. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to pitavastatin 4 mg or pravastatin 40 mg with matching placebos once daily orally for 12 weeks, followed by a 40 week safety extension. Randomisation was stratified by viral hepatitis B or C coinfection and computer-generated. Investigators, patients, study staff, and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment group. The primary endpoint was percentage change in fasting serum LDL cholesterol from baseline to week 12 and the primary efficacy analysis was done in the modified intention-to-treat population. The safety analysis included all patients who took at least one dose of study medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01301066.  Findings:   Between Feb 23, 2011, and March 29, 2013, we randomly assigned 252 patients to the pitavastatin (n=126) or pravastatin group (n=126). LDL cholesterol reduction was 31·1% with pitavastatin and 20·9% with pravastatin (least squares mean difference -9·8%, 95% CI -13·8 to -5·9; p<0·0001) at 12 weeks. At week 52, four patients (3%) in the pitavastatin group and six (5%) in the pravastatin group had virological failure, with no significant difference between treatments. Both treatments had neutral effects on glucose metabolism parameters. 85 patients treated with pitavastatin (68%) and 88 patients treated with pravastatin (70%) reported treatment-emergent adverse events, and these caused study discontinuation in six patients (5%) versus five patients (4%). No serious adverse event occurred in more than one participant and none were treatment-related according to investigator assessment. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhoea in the pitavastatin group (n=12, 10%) and upper respiratory tract infection in the pravastatin group (n=14, 11%). 11 treatment-emergent serious adverse events were noted in seven patients (6%) in the pitavastatin group (atrial septal defect, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chest pain, diverticulitis, enterovesical fistula, gastroenteritis, viral gastroenteritis, herpes dermatitis, multiple fractures, respiratory failure, and transient ischaemic attack) and four events in three patients (2%) in the pravastatin group (cerebrovascular accident, arteriosclerosis coronary artery, myocardial infraction, and muscle haemorrhage). In the pravastatin treatment group, one additional patient discontinued due to an adverse event (prostate cancer that was diagnosed during the screening period, 42 days before first dose of study treatment, and therefore was not a treatment-emergent adverse event).  Interpretation:   The INTREPID results support guideline recommendations for pitavastatin as a preferred drug in the treatment of dyslipidaemia in people with HIV.

Here, we showed that the DUS4L-BCAP29 fusion transcript exists in a variety of normal tissues. It is also present in non-cancer epithelial, as well as in fibroblast cell lines. Quantitatively, the fusion transcript has a comparable expression in non-cancerous, gastric and prostate cell lines and tissues as in the cancer cell lines and tissues. The loss-of-function approach as previously reported is not sufficient to prove the functionality of the fusion. On the other hand, the gain-of-function approach showed that overexpression of DUS4L-BCAP29 promotes cell growth and motility, even in non-cancer cells. Finally, we provide further evidence that the fusion transcript is a product of cis-splicing between adjacent genes. In summary, we believe that in contrast to traditional gene fusions, DUS4L-BCAP29 cannot be used as a cancer biomarker.

Increased ECI2 expression predicts mortality in prostate cancer patients (p = 0.0086). ECI2 encodes for an enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, and we use multiple metabolite profiling platforms and RNA-seq to show that inhibition of ECI2 expression leads to decreased glucose utilization, accumulation of fatty acids and down-regulation of cell cycle related genes. In normal cells, decrease in fatty acid degradation is compensated by increased consumption of glucose, and here we demonstrate that prostate cancer cells are not able to respond to decreased fatty acid degradation. Instead, prostate cancer cells activate incomplete autophagy, which is followed by activation of the cell death response. Finally, we identified a clinically approved compound, perhexiline, which inhibits fatty acid degradation, and replicates the major findings for ECI2 knockdown.

Here we use an approach to attach the recently discovered Achilles heel. The experimental treatment established in this study is based on the recent discovery that it is the FABP5-PPARγ-VEGF signalling axis, rather than the androgen receptor pathway, played a dominant role in promoting the malignant progression of castration resistant prostate cancer cells. Treatments have been established in mice by suppressing the biological activity of FABP5 using a chemical inhibitor SBFI26. The inhibitor significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasiveness and colony formation of PC3-M cells in vitro. It also produced a highly significant suppression of both the metastases and the primary tumours developed from cancer cells implanted orthotopically into the prostate glands of the mice. The inhibitor SBFI26 interferes with the FABP5-PPARγ- signalling pathway at the initial stage of the signal transduction by binding competitively to FABP5 to inhibit cellular fatty acid uptake. This avoids the fatty-acid stimulation of PPARγ and prevents it activating the down-stream regulated cancer-promoting genes.

In this apoptotic process, the redox machinery was aberrantly switched on in the pancreatic cancer cells as well as prostate cancer DU145 cells. p73 was phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus, accompanied with UPR activation and induction of apoptosis. The in vitro results were corroborated by the in vivo data.

As a result of CCDC6 degradation, the induction of PARP inhibitors sensitivity was evaluated by analyzing PC cells viability and foci formation. We scored and correlated CCDC6 and USP7 expression levels in a prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA).  Results:   P5091 accelerated the degradation of AR and V7 isoform affecting PSA, UBE2C, CDC20 transcription and PC cells proliferation.

FAM13C was detectable in cell nuclei of cancerous and non-neoplastic prostate cells. 67.5% of 9,633 interpretable cancers showed FAM13C expression: strong in 28.3%, moderate in 24.6% and weak in 14.6%. Strong FAM13C expression was linked to advanced pT stage, high Gleason grade, positive lymph node status, and early biochemical recurrence (p < 0.0001 each). FAM13C expression was associated with TMPRSS2:ERG fusions. It was present in 85% of ERG positive but in only 54% of ERG negative cancers (p < 0.0001), and in 91.1% of PTEN deleted but in only 69.2% of PTEN non-deleted cancers (p < 0.0001). The prognostic role of FAM13C expression was independent of classical and quantitative Gleason grade, pT stage, pN stage, surgical margin status and preoperative PSA. In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrate that expression of FAM13C is an independent prognostic marker in prostate cancer. Finding FAM13C also in non-neoplastic prostate tissues highlights the importance of properly selecting cancer-rich areas for RNA-based FAM13C expression analysis.""","""['Christoph Burdelski', 'Laura Borcherding', 'Martina Kluth', 'Claudia Hube-Magg', 'Nathaniel Melling', 'Ronald Simon', 'Christina Möller-Koop', 'Philipp Weigand', 'Sarah Minner', 'Alexander Haese', 'Hans Uwe Michl', 'Maria Christina Tsourlakis', 'Frank Jacobsen', 'Andrea Hinsch', 'Corinna Wittmer', 'Patrick Lebok', 'Stefan Steurer', 'Jakob R Izbicki', 'Guido Sauter', 'Till Krech', 'Franziska Büscheck', 'Till Clauditz', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Waldemar Wilczak']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['The prognostic value of SUMO1/Sentrin specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) in prostate cancer is limited to ERG-fusion positive tumors lacking PTEN deletion.', 'Overexpression of the A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase ADAM15 is linked to a Small but Highly Aggressive Subset of Prostate Cancers.', 'βIII-tubulin overexpression is an independent predictor of prostate cancer progression tightly linked to ERG fusion status and PTEN deletion.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Validation of proposed prostate cancer biomarkers with gene expression data: a long road to travel.', 'SR-TWAS: Leveraging Multiple Reference Panels to Improve TWAS Power by Ensemble Machine Learning.', 'FAM family gene prediction model reveals heterogeneity, stemness and immune microenvironment of UCEC.', 'Meta-Analysis of SNPs Determining Litter Traits in Pigs.', 'Investigation of the effects of overexpression of jumping translocation breakpoint (JTB) protein in MCF7 cells for potential use as a biomarker in breast cancer.', 'A Ten-N6-Methyladenosine (m6A)-Modified Gene Signature Based on a Risk Score System Predicts Patient Prognosis in Rectum Adenocarcinoma.']"""

To examine its physiologic role in the prostate epithelium in vivo, we generated mice with prostate-specific biallelic ablation of Spop. These mice exhibited increased prostate mass, prostate epithelial cell proliferation, and expression of c-MYC protein compared to littermate controls, and eventually developed prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). We found that SPOPWT can physically interact with c-MYC protein and, upon exogenous expression in vitro, can promote c-MYC ubiquitination and degradation. This effect was attenuated in PC cells by introducing PC-associated SPOP mutants or upon knockdown of SPOP via short-hairpin-RNA, suggesting that SPOP inactivation directly increases c-MYC protein levels. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis revealed enrichment of Myc-induced genes in transcriptomic signatures associated with SPOPMT. Likewise, we observed strong inverse correlation between c-MYC activity and SPOP mRNA levels in two independent PC patient cohorts. The core SPOPMT;MYCHigh transcriptomic response, defined by the overlap between the SPOPMT and c-MYC transcriptomic programmes, was also associated with inferior clinical outcome in human PCs. Finally, the organoid-forming capacity of Spop-null murine prostate cells was more sensitive to c-MYC inhibition than that of Spop-WT cells, suggesting that c-MYC upregulation functionally contributes to the proliferative phenotype of Spop knock-out prostates. Taken together, our data highlight SPOP as an important regulator of luminal epithelial cell proliferation and c-MYC expression in prostate physiology, identify c-MYC as a novel bona fide SPOP substrate, and help explain the frequent inactivation of SPOP in human PC.

Cells were exposed to escalating doses of sunitinib treatment and subsequent cell viability and cell cycle analyses were performed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of sunitinib in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining of microtubule associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) puncta was employed to assess autophagy levels after sunitinib treatment. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate variations in the levels of LC3, sequestosome-1, extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and cleaved caspase-3 proteins. The present study revealed that sunitinib treatment inhibited cell growth and triggered autophagy in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines. In addition, sunitinib activated ERK1/2 and inhibited mTOR/p70S6K signaling. Sunitinib-induced autophagy was notably reversed by ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor, U0126. Furthermore, inhibition of sunitinib-induced autophagy by 3-methyladenine enhanced apoptosis and exhibited improved cell viability, which indicated that sunitinib induces not only apoptosis but also autophagic cell death in prostate cancer cell lines.

DNA methylation is a stable genomic modification that is detectable in peripheral patient fluids such as urine and blood plasma that could serve as a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for prostate cancer.  Methods:   We measured genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in 73 clinically annotated fresh-frozen prostate cancers and 63 benign-adjacent prostate tissues using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. We overlaid the most significantly differentially methylated sites in the genome with transcription factor binding sites measured by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements consortium. We used logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves to assess the performance of candidate diagnostic models.  Results:   We identified methylation patterns that have a high predictive power for distinguishing malignant prostate tissue from benign-adjacent prostate tissue, and these methylation signatures were validated using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Project. Furthermore, by overlaying ENCODE transcription factor binding data, we observed an enrichment of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 binding in gene regulatory regions with higher DNA methylation in malignant prostate tissues.  Conclusions:   DNA methylation patterns are greatly altered in prostate cancer tissue in comparison to benign-adjacent tissue.

We therefore explored associations among dioxins, steroid hormones, age and prostate cancer risk in men. We compared serum levels of dioxin, steroid hormones and prostate specific antigen (PSA) in men aged 56-81years from herbicide-exposed hotspots (n=50) with those from non-sprayed regions (n=48). Mean serum levels of dioxin congeners in the hotspot group were 1.5-11.3 times higher than the non-sprayed group depending on specific compound. Levels of testosterone, estradiol and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) activity in the hotspot group were also significantly higher than in non-sprayed group. Estradiol levels were significantly related to levels of several specific dioxin derivatives in both group. Significant positive correlations were also found between DHT and 1234678-HpCDD or 1234678-HpCDF; and between 3β-HSD activity and 123678-HxCDD, 123478-HxCDF, 123678-HxCDF, or HxCB#169. After adjusting for age, body mass index, and tobacco use, multiple linear regressions showed levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol, testosterone and 3β-HSD activity were not associated with dioxins in the two groups; however, levels of DHT, testosterone and 3β-HSD activity increased significantly with age in the hotspot group. The hotspot and non-sprayed groups did not significantly differ in PSA levels. But six of the hotspot subjects had PSA levels >3ng/mL, 3 of whom were suspected to have prostate cancer (PC) after digital rectal examination. Our findings suggest that dioxin exposure can lead to increased levels of several sex steroid hormones with age. The correlation of dioxin with steroid hormone levels and prostate cancer risk should be studied further.""","""['Xian Liang Sun', 'Teruhiko Kido', 'Seijiro Honma', 'Eitetsu Koh', 'Rie Okamoto', 'Ho Dung Manh', 'Shoko Maruzeni', 'Muneko Nishijo', 'Hideaki Nakagawa', 'Takeshi Nakano', 'Takumi Takasuga', 'Dang Duc Nhu', 'Nguyen Ngoc Hung', 'Le Ke Son']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Total Environ""","""['Influence of dioxin exposure upon levels of prostate-specific antigen and steroid hormones in Vietnamese men.', 'Androgen disruption by dioxin exposure in 5-year-old Vietnamese children: Decrease in serum testosterone level.', 'Decreased serum testosterone levels associated with 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in 7-year-old children from a dioxin-exposed area of Vietnam.', 'Research on the Relationship between Exposure to Dioxins and Cancer Incidence in Vietnam.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer: collateral damage in the battle of the bulge.', 'Temporal association of prostate cancer incidence with World Trade Center rescue/recovery work.', 'PCDD/PCDFs and PCBs in the irrigation water in Egypt: levels, patterns, and potential sources.', 'MicroRNAs and their role in environmental chemical carcinogenesis.']"""

The androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, constitutes the main drug target for advanced cases of the disease. However, a variety of other transcription factors and signaling networks have been shown to be altered in patients and to influence AR activity. Amongst these, the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc has been studied extensively in multiple malignancies and elevated protein levels of c-Myc are commonly observed in PCa. Its impact on AR activity, however, remains elusive. In this study, we assessed the impact of c-Myc overexpression on AR activity and transcriptional output in a PCa cell line model and validated the antagonistic effect of c-MYC on AR-targets in patient samples. We found that c-Myc overexpression partially reprogrammed AR chromatin occupancy and was associated with altered histone marks distribution, most notably H3K4me1 and H3K27me3. We found c-Myc and the AR co-occupy a substantial number of binding sites and these exhibited enhancer-like characteristics. Interestingly, c-Myc overexpression antagonised clinically relevant AR target genes. Therefore, as an example, we validated the antagonistic relationship between c-Myc and two AR target genes, KLK3 (alias PSA, prostate specific antigen), and Glycine N-Methyltransferase (GNMT), in patient samples. Our findings provide unbiased evidence that MYC overexpression deregulates the AR transcriptional program, which is thought to be a driving force in PCa.""","""['Stefan J Barfeld', 'Alfonso Urbanucci', 'Harri M Itkonen', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Jessica L Hicks', 'Bernd Thiede', 'Paul S Rennie', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Angelo M DeMarzo', 'Ian G Mills']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""EBioMedicine""","""['Prostate cancer: Antagonizing AR: MYC affects transcription.', 'KDM1A triggers androgen-induced miRNA transcription via H3K4me2 demethylation and DNA oxidation.', 'FOXM1 promotes the progression of prostate cancer by regulating PSA gene transcription.', 'MiR137 is an androgen regulated repressor of an extended network of transcriptional coregulators.', 'Androgen receptor enhancer usage and the chromatin regulatory landscape in human prostate cancers.', 'Prostate specific antigen gene regulation by androgen receptor.', 'Strategies to target the cancer driver MYC in tumor cells.', 'The Implication of Topoisomerase II Inhibitors in Synthetic Lethality for Cancer Therapy.', 'STEAP1 regulation and its influence modulating the response of LNCaP prostate cancer cells to bicalutamide, enzalutamide and apalutamide.', 'Quantitative In Vivo Imaging of the Androgen Receptor Axis Reveals Degree of Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy Response.', 'To bind or not to bind: Cistromic reprogramming in prostate cancer.']"""

However, the extent of the risk is unknown for many cancer types; thus, it is unclear who might benefit from screening.  Materials and methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data set from 1992 to 2012 was used to identify patients with previous malignancies who received a diagnosis of NSCLC ≥ 6 months after their initial cancer diagnosis. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for NSCLC were calculated as a ratio of the observed to expected cases adjusted by person-years at risk. Cancers with a SIR > 1.0 had a risk of NSCLC greater than expected. The analyses were stratified by sex, radiation therapy use, and histologic type.  Results:   Among the cancer survivors, 32,058 developed NSCLC. Smoking-related (lung, head and neck, bladder) and hematologic malignancies, regardless of previous radiation therapy, had the greatest SIR for NSCLC (range, 1.97-4.88). Colorectal and renal cancer survivors also had an increased SIR for NSCLC (1.16 and 1.21, respectively). Women with previous pancreatic cancer treated with radiation, breast cancer with or without radiation therapy, and those with thyroid cancer demonstrated a greater SIR for lung adenocarcinoma. Men with previous irradiated prostate cancer also had an elevated SIR (1.08; 99% confidence interval, 1.01-1.15) for lung adenocarcinoma. Patients with melanoma, prostate or uterine cancer had a lower SIR for NSCLC than expected.  Conclusion:   Smoking-related malignancies had the greatest risk of NSCLC. Radiation therapy conferred an elevated risk of NSCLC for certain cancers. Melanoma, prostate, and uterine cancer survivors had a low risk of NSCLC.

Objective:   To update a nomogram predicting LNI in contemporary PCa patients with detailed biopsy reports.  Design, setting, and participants:   Overall, 681 patients with detailed biopsy information, evaluated by a high-volume uropathologist, treated with radical prostatectomy and ePLND between 2011 and 2016 were identified.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A multivariable logistic regression model predicting LNI was fitted and represented the basis for a coefficient-based nomogram. The model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic-derived area under the curve (AUC), calibration plot, and decision-curve analyses (DCAs).  Results and limitations:   The median number of nodes removed was 16. Overall, 79 (12%) patients had LNI. A multivariable model that included prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason grade group, percentage of cores with highest-grade PCa, and percentage of cores with lower-grade disease represented the basis for the nomogram. After cross validation, the predictive accuracy of these predictors in our cohort was 90.8% and the DCA demonstrated improved risk prediction against threshold probabilities of LNI ≤20%. Using a cutoff of 7%, 471 (69%) ePLNDs would be spared and LNI would be missed in seven (1.5%) patients. As compared with the Briganti and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomograms, the novel model showed higher AUC (90.8% vs 89.5% vs 89.5%), better calibration characteristics, and a higher net benefit at DCA.  Conclusions:   An ePLND should be avoided in patients with detailed biopsy information and a risk of nodal involvement below 7%, in order to spare approximately 70% ePLNDs at the cost of missing only 1.5% LNIs.  Patient summary:   We developed a novel nomogram to predict lymph node invasion (LNI) in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer based on detailed biopsy reports. A lymph node dissection exclusively in men with a risk of LNI >7% according to this model would significantly reduce the number of unnecessary pelvic nodal dissections with a risk of missing only 1.5% of patients with LNI.""","""['Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Emanuele Zaffuto', 'Marco Bandini', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Carlo Andrea Bravi', 'Giuseppe Fallara', 'Francesco Pellegrino', 'Luigi Nocera', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Zhe Tian', 'Massimo Freschi', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['A Novel Nomogram to Identify Candidates for Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection Among Patients with Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Diagnosed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted and Systematic Biopsies.', 'External Validation of the 2019 Briganti Nomogram for the Identification of Prostate Cancer Patients Who Should Be Considered for an Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection.', 'External validation of the updated nomogram predicting lymph node invasion in patients with prostate cancer undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer: indications, extent and tailored approaches.', 'Development and internal validation of a novel nomogram for predicting lymph node invasion for prostate cancer patients undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Negative predictive value of PSMA PET scan for lymph node staging in patients undergoing robotic radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Feasibility and accuracy of prostate cancer risk calculators in prediction of prostate cancer, extraprostatic extension as well as the risk of lymph nodes metastasis.', 'Comparison of Four Validated Nomograms (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Briganti 2012, 2017, and 2019) Predicting Lymph Node Invasion in Patients with High-Risk Prostate Cancer Candidates for Radical Prostatectomy and Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection: Clinical Experience and Review of the Literature.', 'LAPAROSCOPIC RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY: SINGLE CENTER CASE SERIES.']"""

Patients and methods:   As a part of a prospective outcome tracking protocol, 81 patients treated at a single center between with proton beam therapy completed the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire before treatment and at the follow-up examinations. We reviewed the dosimetric data, reported as Vx (volume of organ receiving x Gy), and patient-reported QOL at 6 months. Genitourinary QOL was assessed using the American Urological Association symptom score and EPIC urinary domain score. GI QOL was assessed using the EPIC GI domain score.  Results:   Larger prostate glands were associated with greater bladder V70 (P < .01) and rectal V70 (P < .01). The rectal V70 was < 15% for all patients (range, 4%-13.8%) with the planned treatment volume coverage (percentage of the prescription dose covering 95% of the volume > 95%) maintained. Patients with larger prostates did not have a greater change in their American Urological Association symptom index scores (< 30 cm3, +2.3; 30-49 cm3, +3.2; ≥ 50 cm3, 0.2; P = .06) or urinary domain score (< 30 cm3, -3.6; 30-49 cm3, -3.1; ≥ 50 cm3, +3.8; P = .76) at 6 months after treatment.

Conclusion:   Definitive proton beam therapy for prostate cancer to a dose of 79.2 Gy resulted in excellent patient-reported urinary and GI QOL, independently of the baseline prostate size.

Novel aspects of this work are: i) the calculation of theoretical isotopic distributions of the different isotopologues from an experimentally measured value of % 13C enrichment of the labeled precursor ii) the calculation of the contribution of lack of mass resolution of the mass spectrometer and different fragmentation mechanism such as the loss or gain of hydrogen atoms in the EI source to measure the purity of the selected cluster for each metabolite and iii) the validation of the methodology not only by the analysis of gravimetrically prepared mixtures of isotopologues but also by the comparison of the obtained molar fractions with experimental values obtained by GC-Combustion-IRMS based on 13C/12C isotope ratio measurements. The method is able to measure molar fractions for twenty-eight intracellular metabolites derived from glucose metabolism in cell cultures grown in the presence of 13C-labeled Glucose. The validation strategies demonstrate a satisfactory accuracy and precision of the proposed procedure. Also, our results show that the minimum value of 13C incorporation that can be accurately quantified is significantly influenced by the calculation of the spectral purity of the measured cluster and the number of 13C atoms of the labeled precursor. The proposed procedure was able to accurately quantify gravimetrically prepared mixtures of natural and labeled glucose molar fractions of 0.07% and mixtures of natural and labeled glycine at molar fractions down to 0.7%.

Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. TRUS-guided biopsy is the current clinical standard for prostate cancer diagnosis and assessment. State-of-the-art, clinical MR-TRUS image fusion relies upon semi-automated segmentations of the prostate in both the MR and the TRUS images to perform non-rigid surface-based registration of the gland. Segmentation of the prostate in TRUS imaging is itself a challenging task and prone to high variability. These segmentation errors can lead to poor registration and subsequently poor localization of biopsy targets, which may result in false-negative cancer detection. In this paper, we present a non-rigid surface registration approach to MR-TRUS fusion based on a statistical deformation model (SDM) of intra-procedural deformations derived from clinical training data. Synthetic validation experiments quantifying registration volume of interest overlaps of the PI-RADS parcellation standard and tests using clinical landmark data demonstrate that our use of an SDM for registration, with median target registration error of 2.98 mm, is significantly more accurate than the current clinical method. Furthermore, we show that the low-dimensional SDM registration results are robust to segmentation errors that are not uncommon in clinical TRUS data.""","""['John A Onofrey', 'Lawrence H Staib', 'Saradwata Sarkar', 'Rajesh Venkataraman', 'Cayce B Nawaf', 'Preston C Sprenkle', 'Xenophon Papademetris']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['LEARNING NONRIGID DEFORMATIONS FOR CONSTRAINED POINT-BASED REGISTRATION FOR IMAGE-GUIDED MR-TRUS PROSTATE INTERVENTION.', 'Biomechanical modeling constrained surface-based image registration for prostate MR guided TRUS biopsy.', 'Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Our previous studies in autoimmunity have demonstrated that increased antigen load within a tissue enhances immune reactivity against it. We therefore hypothesized that enhancing expression of target proteins on breast tumors can increase efficacy of targeted immunotherapy. We hypothesized that antagonism of the estrogen receptor (ER) can increase expression of targets that are hormonally regulated and facilitate enhanced tumor recognition by targeted immunotherapy. We used a lactation protein α-Lactalbumin, a known immunotherapeutic target on breast tumors, as our model target antigen. Enhancement of target protein expression in human and murine breast tumors was tested in vitro and in vivo by ER antagonism using clinically established ER modulators, Tamoxifen and Fulvestrant. We show that antagonism of the ER can induce a 2-3 fold increase in expression of target proteins on tumors leaving the normal breast tissue unaffected. Tumor progression studies in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice show that efficacy of adoptively transferred cell based targeted immunotherapy was enhanced by target antigen amplification resulting in significantly higher tumor inhibition. However, in spite of increased target expression, anti-tumor efficacy of direct immunization was not enhanced probably due to other limiting factors involved in the immune priming process.

The current therapeutic options for patients with CRPC are limited and new drugs are desperately needed to eliminate these crucial growth signaling pathways. We have previously shown that combination of carmustine and selenite effectively induces apoptosis and growth inhibition by targeting AR and AR-variants in CRPC cells. High levels of EGFR expression present in the CRPC cells mediates the cell proliferation via AR-independent growth signaling mechanisms. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether the combination of carmustine and selenite could inhibit EGFR mediated growth signaling and induce apoptosis in androgen independent-AR negative prostate cancer cells. EGF exposure dose and time dependently increased phospho-EGFR (Tyr845, Tyr1068, and Tyr1045), pAkt (Ser473), and pERK1/2 (Thr204/Tyr202) protein expression levels in AIPC cells. Combination of carmustine and selenite treatment markedly suppressed EGF-stimulated proliferation and survival of AIPC cells and effectively induced apoptosis. The ROS generated by the combination of carmustine and selenite exhibited a strong inhibition on EGF stimulated EGFR and its downstream signaling molecules such as Akt, NF-kB, ERK1/2, and Cyclin D1. Individual agent treatment showed only partial effect. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the combination of carmustine and selenite treatment dramatically inhibits EGFR signaling, proliferation, and induces apoptosis in AIPC cells, suggesting a potential candidate for the treatment of CRPC.

We focused our attention on the rate of the first PSA increase and on the influence of prostatic inflammation.  Methods:   From 2011 to 2016, 365 men with a previous negative prostate biopsy and persistent elevated PSA levels received dutasteride treatment.

Results:   One hundred twelve cases with a confirmed PSA increase >0.5 ng/ml over the nadir value during the follow-up were included in Group A and underwent a new prostate biopsy. In Group A, the PSA increase was associated with PC at the re-biopsy in 66% of cases. The percentage of PSA reduction after 6 months of treatment was not a significant indicator of the risk for PC. The distribution of inflammatory infiltrates significantly (p<00.01) varied from positive to negative prostate biopsies.

The number of cases of prostate cancer has increased dramatically in recent 20 years. Radical prostatectomy is a surgical method for the first-line treatment of localised prostate cancer. We performed the first robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy on December 16th, 2005, achieved the boundary of 1000 robotic-assisted radical prostatectomies in 2012, and in 2015, we successfully completed the 1500th robotic-assisted operation on the prostate.  Method:   We retrospectively evaluated the oncological and functional results in 1,500 consecutive patients who underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy at our institution between 20052015. The robotic system da Vinci Standard was used for the operations until November 2013, and subsequently the robotic system da Vinci Si HD. Mean age of the patients was 63.7 years (40 to 86); mean BMI was 27.7 (19.4 to 41.4); and mean preoperative PSA was 6.7 ng/ml (0.4 to 112.0).  Results:   Pathological stage of the localised prostate cancer was found in 1125 (75%) men, and the stage of locally advanced cancer was found in 363 (24.2%) patients. We determined the Gleason score 7 in surgical specimens of 1150 (76.7%) men. 171 (11.4%) men underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy; metastases in the pelvic lymph nodes were detected in 36 (21.1%) patients. Urinary continence in the period of up to 1 year after the surgery was evaluated in 1218 (81.2%) patients in the group. 1119 (91.9%) men needed no incontinence pads or one safety pad one year from the surgery. Postoperative erectile function was evaluated in 447 (29.8%) men. One year from the surgery, 247 (55.3%) men were capable of a sufficient erection for sexual intercourse without any supportive therapy. Intraoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification were observed in 20 (1.3%) patients; complications within 3 months from the surgery were observed in 127 (8.5%) patients.

However, identification of such regulatory drivers often represents a major challenge, as specific gene combinations may be required for reprogramming. Here we show that a computational systems approach can identify cell type specification genes (master regulators) that act synergistically, and demonstrate its application for reprogramming of fibroblasts to prostate tissue. We use three such master regulators (FOXA1, NKX3.1 and androgen receptor, AR) in a primed conversion strategy starting from mouse fibroblasts, resulting in prostate tissue grafts with appropriate histological and molecular properties that respond to androgen-deprivation. Moreover, generation of reprogrammed prostate does not require traversal of a pluripotent state. Thus, we describe a general strategy by which cell types and tissues can be generated even with limited knowledge of the developmental pathways required for their specification in vivo.""","""['Flaminia Talos', 'Antonina Mitrofanova', 'Sarah K Bergren', 'Andrea Califano', 'Michael M Shen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['Cell-lineage specificity and role of AP-1 in the prostate fibroblast androgen receptor cistrome.', 'Robust Differentiation of mRNA-Reprogrammed Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Toward a Retinal Lineage.', 'The androgen receptor cistrome is extensively reprogrammed in human prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Engineering cell fate: Spotlight on cell-activation and signaling-directed lineage conversion.', 'Synthetic transcription factors for cell fate reprogramming.', 'Prostate organogenesis.', 'Immunostimulatory Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Subpopulations Can Predict Immunotherapy Response in Head and Neck Cancer.', 'ETS-related gene (ERG) undermines genome stability in mouse prostate progenitors via Gsk3β dependent Nkx3.1 degradation.', 'Detection of Prognostic Biomarkers for Hepatocellular Carcinoma through CircRNA-associated CeRNA Analysis.', 'Mechanism-Centric Approaches for Biomarker Detection and Precision Therapeutics in Cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to assess PSA surge phenomenon in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients treated with abiraterone and to correlate those variations with long-term treatment outcome.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 330 CRPC patients in 11 Italian hospitals, monitoring PSA levels at baseline and every 4 weeks. Other clinical, biochemical and molecular parameters were determined at baseline. We considered PSA surge as PSA increase within the first 8 weeks from starting abiraterone more than 1% from baseline followed by a PSA decline. The log-rank test was applied to compare survival between groups of patients according to PSA surge. The impact of PSA surge on survival was evaluated by Cox regression analyses.  Results:   A total of 330 patients with CRPC, median age 74 years (range, 45-90), received abiraterone (281 chemotherapy-treated and 49 chemotherapy-naïve). PSA surge was observed in 20 (7%) post-chemotherapy and 2 (4%) chemotherapy-naïve patients. For overall patients presenting PSA surge, timing of PSA peak from baseline was 5 ± 1.8 weeks and PSA rise from baseline was 21 ± 18.4%. The overall median follow-up was 23 months (range 1-62). No significant differences in progression-free survival and overall survival were observed between patients with and without PSA surge (P = 0.16 and =0.86, respectively). In addition, uni- and multivariate analyses showed no baseline factors related to PSA surge.  Conclusion:   PSA surge occurs in both chemotherapy-treated and chemotherapy-naïve patients treated with abiraterone resulting, however, in no long-term impact on outcome. Physicians and patients should be aware of PSA surge challenge to prevent a premature discontinuation of potentially effective therapy with abiraterone.

A better understanding of the kinetics and nature of docetaxel-related fatigue may provide a framework for intervention.  Methods:   This secondary analysis was performed using the MOTIF database, from a phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of modafinil (200 mg/day for 15 days) for docetaxel-related fatigue in men with metastatic prostate cancer [1]. The pattern of fatigue was analysed using the MDASI (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory) score. The impact of modafinil, cumulative docetaxel exposure, age and smoking status on fatigue kinetics were explored. Fatigue-related symptoms were assessed using the SOMA6 (fatigue and related symptoms) subset of the SPHERE (Somatic and Psychological Health Report). Mood was tracked using the short form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF-36).  Results:   Across four docetaxel cycles, fatigue scores were higher in the first week and decreased over weeks two and three. Whilst men randomised to modafinil had reduced fatigue scores, cumulative docetaxel had little impact. Younger men (55-68 years) had significantly reduced fatigue scores, whereas current and ex-smokers had higher scores. There was no significant change in mood status or haemoglobin across treatment cycles. Men described both 'somnolence' and 'muscle fatigue' contributing significantly to their symptom complex.  Conclusions:   Assessment and management of docetaxel-related fatigue remains an important challenge. Given the complex, multifactorial nature of fatigue, identification through structured interview and interventions targeted to specific 'at risk' groups may be the most beneficial. Understanding the temporal pattern (kinetics) and nature of fatigue is critical to guide this process.""","""['A R T Bergin', 'E Hovey', 'A Lloyd', 'G Marx', 'P Parente', 'T Rapke', 'P de Souza']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of modafinil for fatigue in patients treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'Aflibercept versus placebo in combination with docetaxel and prednisone for treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (VENICE): a phase 3, double-blind randomised trial.', 'The effect of modafinil on fatigue, cognitive functioning, and mood in primary brain tumor patients: a multicenter randomized controlled trial.', 'Management of metastatic prostate cancer: the crucial role of geriatric assessment.', 'Addition of Docetaxel to Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Patients with Hormone-sensitive Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Impact of fatigue on quality of life among breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.', 'Efficacy and safety of bupropion in cancer-related fatigue, a randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial.', 'Quality of life in men with metastatic prostate cancer in their final years before death - a retrospective analysis of prospective data.', 'Qualitative and Quantitative Assessment of Patient and Carer Experience of Chemotherapy (Docetaxel) in Combination with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) for the Treatment of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC).']"""

Therefore, we hypothesized that GR antagonism will have therapeutic benefit in CRPC. However, the FDA-approved nonselective, steroidal GR antagonist, mifepristone, lacks GR specificity, reducing its therapeutic potential. Here, we report that two novel nonsteroidal and highly selective GR modulators (SGRM), CORT118335 and CORT108297, have the ability to block GR activity in prostate cancer and slow CRPC progression. In contrast to mifepristone, these novel SGRMs did not affect androgen receptor (AR) signaling, but potently inhibited GR transcriptional activity. Importantly, SGRMs decreased GR-mediated tumor cell viability following AR blockade. In vivo, SGRMs significantly inhibited CRPC progression in high GR-expressing, but not in low GR-expressing xenograft models. Transcriptome analysis following AR blockade and GR activation revealed that these SGRMs block GR-mediated proliferative gene expression pathways. Furthermore, GR-regulated proliferation-associated genes AKAP12, FKBP5, SGK1, CEBPD, and ZBTB16 are inhibited by CORT108297 treatment in vivo Together, these data suggest that GR-selective nonsteroidal SGRMs potently inhibit GR activity and prostate cancer growth despite AR pathway inhibition, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of SGRMs in GR-expressing CRPC.

Recent work led us to hypothesize that this tropism may reflect pathogenic interactions between RAGE, a cell surface receptor expressed on malignant cells in advanced prostate cancer, and proteinase 3 (PR3), a serine protease present in inflammatory neutrophils and hematopoietic cells within the bone marrow microenvironment. In this study, we establish that RAGE-PR3 interaction mediates homing of prostate cancer cells to the bone marrow. PR3 bound to RAGE on the surface of prostate cancer cells in vitro, inducing tumor cell motility through a nonproteolytic signal transduction cascade involving activation and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK1. In preclinical models of experimental metastasis, ectopic expression of RAGE on human prostate cancer cells was sufficient to promote bone marrow homing within a short timeframe. Our findings demonstrate how RAGE-PR3 interactions between human prostate cancer cells and the bone marrow microenvironment mediate bone metastasis during prostate cancer progression, with potential implications for prognosis and therapeutic intervention.

In this study, we demonstrate that codelivery of paclitaxel and 2'-hydroxy-2,4,4',5,6'-pentamethoxychalcone (termed rubone) drives upregulation of miR-34a and chemosensitizes paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells, killing both cancer stem-like cells (CSC) and bulk tumor cells. Rubone upregulated miR-34a and reversed its downstream target genes in DU145-TXR and PC3-TXR cells. Paclitaxel and rubone combination therapy inhibited tumor cell growth, migration, and CSC population growth. We synthesized poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-carboxyl-propylene carbonate-graft-dodecanol; PEG-PCD) to prepare micelles. The drug-loading capacities were 9.70% ± 0.10% and 5.34% ± 0.02% for paclitaxel and rubone, respectively, controlling a drug release of 60.20% ± 2.67% and 60.62% ± 4.35% release of paclitaxel and rubone at 24 hours. Delivery of miR-34a and rubone decreased PC3-TXR cell viability with increasing paclitaxel concentration. Coincubation with a miR-34a inhibitor diminished the effect of rubone. Paclitaxel IC50 in PC3 and PC3-TXR cells was 55.6 and 2,580 nmol/L, respectively, but decreased to 49.8 and 93.2 nmol/L when treated in combination with rubone, demonstrating a reversal of paclitaxel resistance by rubone. Systemic administration of micelles carrying paclitaxel and rubone inhibited orthotopic prostate tumor growth in nude mice, compared with monotherapy, by reversing the expression of miR-34a, SIRT1, cyclin D1, and E-cadherin. In summary, our results showed how rubone acts as an efficient small-molecule modulator of miR-34a to reverse chemoresistance and further enhance the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel in paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer.

Design:   Systematic analysis of all open-access data.  Setting and participants:   Public and philanthropic funding to all UK cancer research institutions, 2000-2013.  Main outcome measures:   Number and financial value of cancer research investments reported in 2013 UK pounds (UK£). Mortality, DALYs and YLDs data were acquired from the Global Burden of Disease Study. A compound metric was adapted to estimate research investment relative to disease burden as measured by mortality, DALYs and YLDs.  Results:   We identified 4299 funded studies with a total research investment of £2.4 billion. The highest fundings by anatomical sites were haematological, breast, prostate, colorectal and ovarian cancers. Relative to disease burden as determined by a compound metric combining mortality, DALYs and YLDs, gender-specific cancers were found to be highest funded-the five sites that received the most funding were prostate, ovarian, breast, mesothelioma and testicular cancer; the least well-funded sites were liver, thyroid, lung, upper gastrointestinal (GI) and bladder. Preclinical science accounted for 66.2% of award numbers and 62.2% of all funding. The top five areas of primary research focus by funding were pathogenesis, drug therapy, diagnostic, screening and monitoring, women's health and immunology. The largest individual funder was the Medical Research Council. In combination, the five lowest funded site-specific cancers relative to disease burden account for 47.9%, 44.3% and 20.4% of worldwide cancer mortality, DALYs and YLDs.  Conclusions:   Research funding for cancer is not allocated according to relative disease burden. These findings are in line with earlier published studies.

Results from REDUCE""","""Purpose:   We determined whether decreased peak urine flow is associated with future incident lower urinary tract symptoms in men with mild to no lower urinary tract symptoms.  Materials and methods:   Our population consisted of 3,140 men from the REDUCE (Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events) trial with mild to no lower urinary tract symptoms, defined as I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) less than 8. REDUCE was a randomized trial of dutasteride vs placebo for prostate cancer prevention in men with elevated prostate specific antigen and negative biopsy. I-PSS measures were obtained every 6 months throughout the 4-year study. The association between peak urine flow rate and progression to incident lower urinary tract symptoms, defined as the first of medical treatment, surgery or sustained and clinically significant lower urinary tract symptoms, was tested by multivariable Cox models, adjusting for various baseline characteristics and treatment arm.  Results:   On multivariable analysis as a continuous variable, decreased peak urine flow rate was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident lower urinary tract symptoms (p = 0.002). Results were similar in the dutasteride and placebo arms. On univariable analysis when peak flow was categorized as 15 or greater, 10 to 14.9 and less than 10 ml per second, flow rates of 10 to 14.9 and less than 10 ml per second were associated with a significantly increased risk of incident lower urinary tract symptoms (HR 1.39, p = 0.011 and 1.67, p <0.001, respectively). Results were similar on multivariable analysis, although in the 10 to 14.9 ml per second group findings were no longer statistically significant (HR 1.26, p = 0.071).

Activation of the CT-CTR axis in non-invasive LNCaP cells induces an invasive phenotype. In contrast, silencing of CT/CTR expression in highly metastatic PC-3M cells markedly reduces their tumorigenicity and abolishes their ability to form distant metastases in nude mice. Our recent studies suggest that CTR interacts with zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) through PDZ interaction to destabilize tight junctions and increase invasion of PC cells. Our results show that CTR activates AKAP2-anchored cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, which then phosphorylates tight junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin 3. Moreover, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of tight unction proteins required CTR-ZO-1 interaction, suggesting that the interaction may bring CTR-activated PKA in close proximity of tight junction proteins. Furthermore, inhibition of PKA activity attenuated CT-induced loss of TJ functionality and invasion, suggesting that the phosphorylation of TJ proteins is responsible for TJ disassembly. Finally, we show that the prevention of CTR-ZO-1 interaction abolishes CT-induced invasion, and can serve as a novel therapeutic tool to treat aggressive prostate cancers. In brief, the present study identifies the significance of CTR-ZO-1 interaction in progression of prostate cancer to its metastatic form.""","""['Ahmed Aljameeli', 'Arvind Thakkar', 'Girish Shah']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Calcitonin Receptor-Zonula Occludens-1 Interaction Is Critical for Calcitonin-Stimulated Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'A-kinase anchoring protein 2 is required for calcitonin-mediated invasion of cancer cells.', 'Calcitonin increases invasiveness of prostate cancer cells: role for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A in calcitonin action.', 'Phase separation as a therapeutic target in tight junction-associated human diseases.', 'Implications of AMPK in the Formation of Epithelial Tight Junctions.', 'Zinc finger protein‑like 1 is a novel neuroendocrine biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Protein Kinases and Epigenetic Control as Combinatorial Therapy Options for Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Inhibition of miR-29 Activity in the Myeloid Lineage Increases Response to Calcitonin and Trabecular Bone Volume in Mice.', 'New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging Using Peptide-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer.', 'Elevating SOX2 in prostate tumor cells upregulates expression of neuroendocrine genes, but does not reduce the inhibitory effects of enzalutamide.']"""

In this study, we measure changes in serum kallikrein (KLKs) levels during intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in prostate cancer patients, and find potential correlations between serum kallikrein level and normal tissues toxicity during radiation.  Methods:   Forty-nine patients with prostate cancer were recruited as follows: group 1, definitive standard fractionation IMRT (78Gy in 39 fractions, n=15); group 2, definitive hypofractionated IMRT (60Gy in 20 fractions, n=15); and group 3, IMRT postprostatectomy (66Gy in 33 fractions, n=19). Patients treated with definitive radiation therapy were intermediate risk. Blood samples were collected at baseline and quarterly during IMRT and at each follow-up visit. Acute toxicity was graded weekly during radiotherapy using CTC-AE v4.0 criteria. Multiplexed immunoassays were used to quantify total, free, and intact Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), as well as Kallikreins 2, 4, 6, and 11.  Results:   The serum kallikreins, PSA (total, free and intact), KLK2, 6, and 11 change significantly after definitive radiotherapy. KLK2 and intact PSA decrease as fast as two weeks after initiation of radiation, while the first significant decrease in total and free PSA is noted only at the completion of radiation. KLK6 and KLK11 surge temporarily during radiation therapy and decrease below baseline levels at 8weeks and 12months, respectively after completion of radiation. KLK4 levels did not change with radiation. There was no correlation between GU or GI toxicities and serum kallikreins.  Conclusions:   PSA, KLK2, 6, and 11, change significantly after definitive prostate radiotherapy, though KLK2 and PSA decrease by the end of the radiation course while KLK6 and KLK11 decrease significantly starting at 2 and 12months, respectively, after radiation.

Improved understanding of the molecular biology of t-NEPC is essential for the development of new effective management approaches for t-NEPC. In this study, we identify a splice variant of the MYST/Esa1-associated factor 6 (MEAF6) gene, MEAF6-1, that is highly expressed in both t-NEPC tumor biopsies and neuroendocrine cell lines of prostate and lung cancers. We show that MEAF6-1 splicing is stimulated by neuronal RNA splicing factor SRRM4. Rather than inducing neuroendocrine trans-differentiation of cells in prostate adenocarcinoma, MEAF6-1 upregulation stimulates cell proliferation, anchorage-independent cell growth, invasion and xenograft tumor growth. Gene microarray identifies that these MEAF6-1 actions are in part mediated by the ID1 and ID3 genes.

Objective:   The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of cancer patients' and FCs' symptoms and demographic characteristics on caregiver burden at initiation of the patients' radiation treatment.  Methods:   Two hundred eighty-one dyads of FCs and cancer patients who received a diagnosis of breast, prostate, melanoma, lymphoma, and head and neck cancers were recruited at the beginning of the patients' radiation treatment. Measures of depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue, social support, and self-efficacy were obtained from both FCs and cancer patients. The family caregivers were also assessed for caregiver burden. Associations between patients' and caregivers' symptoms and demographic characteristics and caregiver burden were investigated using multivariate analyses.  Results:   There were significant associations between caregiver burden and the patient-related variables such as self-efficacy (P = .02), sleep disturbance (P = .03), and social support (P = .04). Among FC-related variables, higher scores of depression (P < .01), fatigue (P < .01), and symptoms (P < .01) were significantly associated with higher caregiver burden. Being a female, either as a patient or FC, increased the likelihood of experiencing fatigue and sleep disturbance.  Conclusion:   Caregiver burden in FCs is influenced by interplay of patients' and their own symptoms and problems. These interdependencies exist from the beginning of treatment.

PROMIS measures are standardized to a T-score metric, with a score of 50 representing the general US population mean. Clinically meaningful differences were defined as a 3-point difference in scores. Results Several reference values (means) for patients with cancer were worse than the general United States population norms of 50. These include pain interference (52.4), fatigue (52.2), and physical function (44.1). Reference values were highest (ie, showed greatest symptom burden) in lung cancer (pain interference, 55.5; fatigue, 57.3; depression, 51.4) and cervical cancer (anxiety, 53.2; sleep disturbance, 53.4). Reference values for patients age 65 to 84 years reported lower sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression, and better cognitive function than younger patients. Cancer reference values were poorer among those with advanced disease compared with patients with limited or no evidence of disease, specifically physical function (41.1 v 46.6, respectively), fatigue (55.8 v 50.2, respectively), and pain interference (55.2 v 50.9, respectively). Conclusion In a large, population-based sample of patients with recently diagnosed cancer, we observed symptom severity and functional deficits by age, stage, and cancer type consistent with the expected impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment. These United States cancer reference values can help facilitate interpretation of the PROMIS domain scores in research studies or in clinical applications that measure and evaluate the symptom and functional burden patients with cancer experience after initial treatment.""","""['Roxanne E Jensen', 'Arnold L Potosky', 'Carol M Moinpour', 'Tania Lobo', 'David Cella', 'Elizabeth A Hahn', 'David Thissen', 'Ashley Wilder Smith', 'Jaeil Ahn', 'George Luta', 'Bryce B Reeve']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['People with multiple sclerosis report significantly worse symptoms and health related quality of life than the US general population as measured by PROMIS and NeuroQoL outcome measures.', 'Fatigue, patient reported outcomes, and objective measurement of physical activity in systemic lupus erythematosus.', 'Validation of the PROMIS physical function measures in a diverse US population-based cohort of cancer patients.', 'Standardizing patient-reported outcomes assessment in cancer clinical trials: a patient-reported outcomes measurement information system initiative.', 'Screening for High Blood Pressure in Adults: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Factors associated with weight gain in pre- and post-menopausal women receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer.', 'Development and preliminary validation of the Brief Self-Compassion Inventory.', 'Outcome Measures and Patient-Reported Metrics in Cancer Rehabilitation.', 'Impact of acceptance and commitment therapy on physical and psychological symptoms in advanced gastrointestinal cancer patients and caregivers: Secondary results of a pilot randomized trial.', 'Perceived COVID-19 pandemic impact and protective factors predicting patient-reported depression and anxiety in individuals living with cancer.']"""

In this work, we showed that androgen could induce a quiescent state that is self-sustained in a cell-autonomous manner through a ""hit and run"" mechanism in androgen receptor-expressing prostate cancer cells. This phenomenon required the set-up of a sustained redox imbalance and TGFβ/BMP signaling that were dependent on culturing cells at low density. At medium cell density, androgens failed to induce such a self-sustained quiescent state, which correlated with a lesser induction of cell redox imbalance and oxidative stress markers like CDKN1A. These effects of androgens could be mimicked by transient overexpression of CDKN1A that triggered its own expression and a sustained SMAD phosphorylation in cells cultured at low cell density. Overall, our data suggest that self-sustained but fully reversible quiescent states might constitute a general response of dispersed cancer cells to stress conditions.""","""['Anh Thu Bui', 'Meng-Er Huang', 'Maryline Havard', 'Fanny Laurent-Tchenio', 'François Dautry', 'Thierry Tchenio']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Rationale for bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) for metastatic prostate cancer.', 'SMAD signaling and redox imbalance cooperate to induce prostate cancer cell dormancy.', 'Bone morphogenetic protein-2 induces hypophosphorylation of Rb protein and repression of E2F in androgen-treated LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'BMP signals inhibit proliferation and in vivo tumor growth of androgen-insensitive prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'The testosterone paradox of advanced prostate cancer: mechanistic insights and clinical implications.', 'Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates self-sustained quiescence, tumor indolence, and late clinical metastasis in a Beclin-1-dependent manner.', 'Discovery proteomics defines androgen-regulated glycoprotein networks in prostate cancer cells, as well as putative biomarkers of prostatic diseases.', 'Titration of Androgen Signaling: How Basic Studies Have Informed Clinical Trials Using High-Dose Testosterone Therapy in Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Suppressing BCL-XL increased the high dose androgens therapeutic effect to better induce the Enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer autophagic cell death.']"""

The comparison was done among three European countries (UK, Germany and France) and Canada, according to the statement of each country and to the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale.

However, price setting and reimbursement decisions remain national responsibility with differences in assessment of the medical value of new treatment across countries, leading to a heterogeneous accessibility to cancer treatments.

Exploring the functions associated with lncRNAs may help provide insight into their underlying biological mechanisms. The current methods primarily focus on investigating the functions of individual lncRNAs; however, essential biological functions may be affected by the combinatorial effects of multiple lncRNAs. Here, we have developed a novel computational method, LncRNAs2Pathways, to identify the functional pathways influenced by the combinatorial effects of a set of lncRNAs of interest based on a global network propagation algorithm. A new Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like statistical measure weighted by the network propagation score, which considers the expression correlation among lncRNAs and coding genes, was used to evaluate the biological pathways influenced by the lncRNAs of interest. We have described the LncRNAs2Pathways methodology and illustrated its effectiveness by analyzing three lncRNA sets associated with glioma, prostate and pancreatic cancers. We further analyzed the reproducibility and robustness and compared our results with those of two other methods.

Microfluidics has been extensively used for this purpose but most methods require several post-separation processing steps including concentration of the sample before analysis. This induces a high risk of sample loss of the collected rare cells. Here, an integrated system is presented that efficiently eliminates this risk by integrating label-free separation with single cell arraying of the target cell population, enabling direct on-chip tumor cell identification and enumeration. Prostate cancer cells (DU145) spiked into a sample with whole blood concentration of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction were efficiently separated and trapped at a recovery of 76.2 ± 5.9% of the cancer cells and a minute contamination of 0.12 ± 0.04% PBMCs while simultaneously enabling a 20x volumetric concentration.

Patients and methods:   Patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer from March 2011 to January 2014 in our healthcare system were included. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) questionnaire was administered before treatment, and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment up to November 2014 for all methods of treatment. The Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare the distribution of each EPIC-26 domain score at each time point, and mixed models were used to assess the overall scores over the period after treatment.  Results:   In all, 5 727 patients were included. There were data for 3 422, 2 329, 2 017, 1 922, 1 772, 1 260, and 837 patients before treatment, and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment, respectively. At 1 month, bowel scores were the lowest for patients that had had radiation therapy, and urinary irritative symptoms were the lowest for those who had had brachytherapy. There were sexual function declines for all the treatment methods, with surgery having the steepest decline; open radical prostatectomy (ORP) had a greater decline than robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). Patients who underwent RALP had a better return of sexual function, approaching that of brachytherapy and radiation therapy at 24 months. Urinary incontinence (UI) also declined the most in surgical patients, with RALP patients improving slightly more than ORP patients at 12-24 months.  Conclusions:   Patients' HRQoL after prostate cancer treatment varies by treatment method. Notably, sexual function recovers most for RALP patients.

Milciclib was administered orally once daily for 7 days on/7 days off in a 4-week cycle, and gemcitabine was administered intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15 in a 4-week cycle.  Results:   All 16 enrolled patients were evaluable for safety and toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicities, which occurred in only one out of nine patients treated at the maximum dose tested (milciclib 80 mg/m2/day and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2/day), consisted of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 ataxia and Grade 2 tremors in the same patient.

Metabotropic GABAB receptor (GABABR) is the GPCR for the main inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the central nervous system. Increased expression of GABABR has been detected in human cancer tissues and cancer cell lines, but the role of GABABR in these cells is controversial and the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether GABABR hijacks RTK signaling to modulate the fates of human prostate cancer cells. RTK array analysis revealed that the GABABR-specific agonist baclofen selectively induced the transactivation of EGFR in PC-3 cells. EGFR transactivation resulted in the activation of ERK1/2 by a mechanism that is dependent on Gi/o protein and that requires matrix metalloproteinase-mediated proligand shedding.

Prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) was compared using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Generally, IDC occurred in older men (≥ 65 years old) and presented with larger sizes, and higher grades, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages, AJCC T stages, lymph node positive rates and metastasis rates. Men with IDC were less likely to undergo radical prostatectomy, but more likely to be treated with adjuvant radiation than men with ACC. Five-year PCSS rates were significantly worse in IDC. In the multivariate analysis, patients with ACC had a better PCSS than patients with IDC. In conclusion, IDC has unique clinicopathological characteristics and has worse prognosis than ACC.

Next generation mapping (NGM) is a new technology that allows for the interrogation of megabase length DNA molecules outside the detection range of single-base resolution NGS. In this study, we sought to determine the feasibility of using the Irys (Bionano Genomics Inc.) nanochannel NGM technology to generate whole genome maps of a primary prostate tumor and matched blood from a Gleason score 7 (4 + 3), ETS-fusion negative prostate cancer patient. With an effective mapped coverage of 35X and sequence coverage of 60X, and an estimated 43% tumor purity, we identified 85 large somatic structural rearrangements and 6,172 smaller somatic variants, respectively. The vast majority of the large SVs (89%), of which 73% are insertions, were not detectable ab initio using high-coverage short-read NGS. However, guided manual inspection of single NGS reads and de novo assembled scaffolds of NGM-derived candidate regions allowed for confirmation of 94% of these large SVs, with over a third impacting genes with oncogenic potential.

An Answer from Free Energy Simulations of the Human Aromatase Enzyme""","""Cytochromes P450 (CYP450s), in particular, CYP19A1 and CYP17A1, are key clinical targets of breast and prostate anticancer therapies, critical players in drug metabolism, and their overexpression in tumors is associated with drug resistance. In these enzymes, ligand (substrates, drugs) metabolism occurs in deeply buried active sites accessible only via several grueling channels, whose exact biological role remains unclear. Gaining direct insights on the mechanism by which ligands travel in and out is becoming increasingly important given that channels are involved in the modulation of binding/dissociation kinetics and the specificity of ligands toward a CYP450. This has profound implications for enzymatic efficiency and drug efficacy/toxicity. Here, by applying free energy methods, for a cumulative simulation time of 20 μs, we provide detailed atomistic characterization and free energy profiles of the entry/exit routes preferentially followed by a substrate (androstenedione) and a last-generation inhibitor (letrozole) to/from the catalytic site of CYP19A1 (the human aromatase (HA) enzyme), a key clinical target against breast cancer, studied here as prototypical CYP450. Despite the remarkably different size/shape/hydrophobicity of the ligands, two channels appear accessible to their entrance, while only one exit route appears to be preferential. Our study shows that the preferential paths may be conserved among different CYP450s. Moreover, our results highlight that, at least in the case of HA, ligand channeling is associated with large enzyme structural rearrangements. A wise choice of the computational method and very long simulations are, thus, required to obtain fully converged quantitative free energy profiles, which might be used to design novel biocatalysts or next-generation cytochrome inhibitors with an in silico tuned Km.""","""['Alessandra Magistrato', 'Jacopo Sgrignani', 'Rolf Krause', 'Andrea Cavalli']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Phys Chem Lett""","""['Influence of the membrane lipophilic environment on the structure and on the substrate access/egress routes of the human aromatase enzyme.

Using a miRNA array, we identified a number of miRNAs upregulated by prolactin treatment, but one in particular that was strongly induced by prolactin and predicted to bind to the 3'UTR of p21 mRNA, miR-106b. By creating a p21 mRNA 3'UTR-luciferase mRNA construct, we demonstrated degradation of the construct in response to prolactin in human breast, prostate and ovarian cancer cell lines. Increased expression of miR-106b replicated, and anti-miR-106b counteracted, the effects of prolactin on degradation of the 3'UTR construct, p21 mRNA levels, and cell proliferation in breast (T47D) and prostate (PC3) cancer cells. Increased expression of miR-106b also stimulated migration of the very epithelioid T47D cell line. By contrast, anti-miR-106b dramatically decreased expression of the mesenchymal markers, SNAIL-2, TWIST-2, VIMENTIN, and FIBRONECTIN. Using signaling pathway inhibitors and the 3'UTR construct, induction of miR-106b by prolactin was determined to be mediated through the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways and not through Jak2/Stat5 in both T47D and PC3 cells. Prolactin activation of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt also activates ERα in the absence of an ERα ligand. 17β-estradiol promoted degradation of the construct in both cell lines and pre-incubation in the estrogen antagonist, Fulvestrant, blocked the ability of both prolactin and 17β-estradiol to induce the construct-degrading activity.

In our previous study, we demonstrated that rs61552325 (Pro1140Ala) located in ERBB2 is strongly correlated to prostate cancer. Therefore, we initially studied the effect of rs61552325 on androgen-independent prostate cancer cell metastasis.  Results:   Bioinformatic results demonstrated that the mutant Pro1140Ala likely decrease the stability of the ERBB2 protein and its interactions. The mean migration rate after 6 h for PC3 minor variant cells which carried the G allele was 1.28-fold higher than major variant PC3 cells that carried the C allele (P = 0.016). The mean invasion rate of DU145 putative minor variant cells was 0.40 reducer than negative control cells (P = 5.9E-04).  Methods:   rs61552325 major variant (C allele) and minor variant (G allele) were produced by site directed mutagenesis and transfected into DU145 and PC3 cells.

We describe the hazard ratios and probabilities related to the use of post-RP radiotherapy.  Material and methods:   Data were collected from the Cancer Registry of Norway and nine radiotherapy units. All patients were diagnosed with a non-metastatic PCa from January 2004 through June 2011. Adjuvant radiotherapy was defined as pelvic radiotherapy initiated <5 months after RP at a PSA <0.2 ng/ml. All other pelvic radiotherapy series were categorized as salvage radiotherapy, and, combined with adjuvant radiotherapy they were termed post-RP radiotherapy.  Results:   Of 6840 prostatectomized patients, 1170 (17%) had undergone post-RP radiotherapy, mainly as salvage radiotherapy. The number of adjuvant radiotherapy series almost tripled from 2009. Based on pre-prostatectomy variables (PSA, Gleason score, and clinical risk group) and findings in the prostatectomy specimens (status of resection margins, pathological tumor category and Gleason's score), the probability of post-RP radiotherapy ranged respectively from 14% to 73%, and from 4% to 83%.  Conclusions:   In our study, post-RP radiotherapy was applied in approximately one in six patients. Based on the combination of PCa-specific variables routinely available at the time of diagnosis, a patient's probability of post-RP radiotherapy can be determined before decision of primary treatment strategy, followed by probability determination based on histopathological variables emerging from the prostatectomy specimen.""","""['Kari Vatne', 'Andreas Stensvold', 'Tor Å Myklebust', 'Bjørn Møller', 'Aud Svindland', 'Rune Kvåle', 'Sophie D Fosså']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'Outcome of salvage radiotherapy for biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy with or without hormonal therapy.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Adjuvant vs. salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'pT3R1 prostate cancer : Immediate or delayed radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy?.', 'The Longitudinal Course of Prospectively Recorded Patient-reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Surgery and Salvage Radiotherapy.', 'Comparative Survival Outcomes of High-risk Prostate Cancer Treated with Radical Prostatectomy or Definitive Radiotherapy Regimens.', 'Is time from diagnosis to radical prostatectomy associated with oncological outcomes?']"""

Methods To investigate the role of miRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) progression, we performed small RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and LNCaP-derived castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) C4-2B cells. For functional validation, we specifically investigated miR-193a-3p, which is highly upregulated in C4-2B cells and modulated by the androgen receptor (AR). We elucidated the role of miR-193a-3p and its downstream target gene in PCa cell migration using biochemical approaches. Results We identified a subset of differentially expressed miRNAs in C4-2B cells compared to LNCaP cells. Computational analysis shows that the targets of upregulated miRNAs are significantly associated with downregulated protein-coding mRNAs in C4-2B cells. Gene Ontology analysis further reveals that these downregulated mRNAs are significantly enriched in cell-cell adhesion functions. Downregulation of these miRNA-targeted genes may change PCa cell motility resulting in the acquisition of metastatic potential. We then focus on miR-193a-3p and demonstrate overexpression of miR-193a-3p increases cell migration through downregulating its target AJUBA. AJUBA is a LIM domain protein and contributes to the formation and stability of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Loss of AJUBA enhances PCa migration and downregulation of AJUBA expression is observed in metastatic PCa tumors.

Increasing evidences reveal that ISO can inhibit cancer cell growth by induced apoptosis, however, the molecular mechanisms is not fully understood. In this study, we found for the first time that ISO apparently induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis by targeting EGFR and its downstream signal pathways in prostate cancer (PCa) cells both in vitro and in vivo, whereas no obviously effect on normal prostate cells. From the results, we found that ISO competitively targeted EGFR with EGF and inhibited EGFR auto-phosphorylation, and then decreased the levels of p-Erk1/2, p-PI3 K, and p-AKT, and further induced down-regulation of p-FOXO1 and promoted FOXO1 nuclear translocation; and finally resulted in a significantly up-regulation of Bim/p21/27/Bax/cleaved Caspase-3/cleaved PARP-1 and a markedly down-regulation of Sp1/Bcl-2/XIAP/Cyclin D1.

The authors prospectively evaluated the impact of the Decipher test, which predicts metastasis risk after radical prostatectomy, on decision making for ART and SRT.  Methods:   A total of 150 patients who were considering ART and 115 who were considering SRT were enrolled. Providers submitted a management recommendation before processing the Decipher test and again at the time of receipt of the test results. Patients completed validated surveys on prostate cancer (PCa)-specific decisional effectiveness and PCa-related anxiety.  Results:   Before the Decipher test, observation was recommended for 89% of patients considering ART and 58% of patients considering SRT. After Decipher testing, 18% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 12%-25%) of treatment recommendations changed in the ART arm, including 31% among high-risk patients; and 32% (95% CI, 24%-42%) of management recommendations changed in the salvage arm, including 56% among high-risk patients. Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) scores were better after viewing Decipher test results (ART arm: median DCS before Decipher, 25 and after Decipher, 19 [P<.001]; SRT arm: median DCS before Decipher, 27 and after Decipher, 23 [P<.001]). PCa-specific anxiety changed after Decipher testing; fear of PCa disease recurrence in the ART arm (P = .02) and PCa-specific anxiety in the SRT arm (P = .05) decreased significantly among low-risk patients.

Clear evidence exists about variations in the incidence of prostate cancer between populations living in different countries. These variations could be explained by differences in lifestyle and a possible association with a set of substances that are able to intervene in the origin of the disease.  Methods:   The reason that lifestyle may be the cause of prostate cancer is related to endocrine disruptors. These are a group of chemical substances that can mimic or alter hormone signaling. These disruptors are able to exert their effect at very low doses and act insidiously over the years, even being able to pass their effect on from one generation to the next. Cholesterol is an essential precursor in the synthesis of androgens, estrogens and other substances that are active in prostate cancer. Cholesterol is a central metabolite in lipid metabolism, the inflammatory response and other elements involved in the formation and progression of cancer. High cholesterol concentrations can give rise to the accumulation of androgens in tumor cells. Additionally, endocrine disruptors have been identified as being responsible for processes related with fertility, genital malformations and various hormonedependent cancers. Disruptors already identified include diethylstilbestrol, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins.  Results:   Though no clear direct association has yet been found in humans between most endocrine disruptors and prostate cancer, evidence suggests that an inadequate diet and contact with certain toxic agents predisposes to the disease. These disruptors are known to be especially relevant at particular times, such as during pregnancy, neonatal stages and puberty.  Conclusions:   The problem with these toxic agents is that their peculiarities and way of acting over time make their study difficult.

Consequently, it is unclear if the current criteria for active surveillance (AS) can safely be applied to Korean patients. Therefore, this study was conducted to define appropriate selection criteria for AS for patients with PC in Korea.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a multicenter retrospective study of 2,126 patients with low risk PC who actually underwent radical prostatectomy. The primary outcome was an unfavorable disease, which was defined by non-organ confined disease or an upgrading of the Gleason score to ≥ 7 (4+3). Predictive variables of an unfavorable outcome were identified by multivariate analysis using randomly selected training samples (n=1,623, 76.3%). We compared our selected criteria to various Western criteria for the primary outcome and validated our criteria using the remaining validation sample (n=503, 23.7%).  Results:   A non-organ confined disease rate of 14.9% was identified, with an increase in Gleason score ≥ 7 (4+3) of 8.7% and a final unfavorable disease status of 20.8%. The following criteria were selected: Gleason score ≤ 6, clinical stage T1-T2a, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 10 ng/mL, PSA density < 0.15 ng/mL/mL, number of positive cores ≤ 2, and maximum cancer involvement in any one core ≤ 20%. These criteria provided the lowest unfavorable disease rate (11.7%) when compared to Western criteria (13.3%-20.7%), and their validity was confirmed using the validation sample (5.9%).

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for SPCs were estimated for different ages at diagnosis, latencies, diagnostic periods, and treatments.  Results:   For patients with primary RCC, the risk of developing a SPC was higher than the risk of developing cancer in the general population (SIR, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.18). Most cancer types showed higher incidences in patients with RCC than in the general population. However, the relative incidence of gastric cancer as an SPC varied by age. Gastric cancer incidence was elevated in young patients (< 30 years) with RCC, but reduced in older (≥ 30) patients with RCC. Patients with advanced RCC died prematurely, regardless of SPC development. In contrast, those with early-stage RCC survived for longer periods, although SPC development affected their post-RCC survival. After SPC development, women had better survival than men.

Methods:   Between April 2007 and May 2016, 86 consecutive Japanese patients with metastatic germ cell tumors were treated with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, including bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin, and paclitaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin. A total of 378 chemotherapy cycles administered for these 86 patients were retrospectively analyzed.  Results:   During the 378 cycles, consisting of 212 for bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin, and 166 for paclitaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin, 81 episodes of febrile neutropenia (21.4%) developed in 34 patients (39.5%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that low estimated glomerular filtration rate and albumin levels were independent risk factors for the development of febrile neutropenia. Furthermore, a significant difference in the incidence of febrile neutropenia was noted according to positive numbers of these two independent risk factors; that is, febrile neutropenia occurred in 13 of 171 courses in patients negative for any risk factors (7.6%), 44 of 155 courses in those positive for a single risk factor (28.4%) and 24 of 52 courses in those positive for two risk factors (46.2%).  Conclusions:   The incidence of febrile neutropenia in Japanese metastatic germ cell tumor patients receiving cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy appears to be higher than reported previously by studies in Western countries. When carrying out cytotoxic chemotherapy, special attention should be paid to patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rate and/or albumin levels considering the high probability of febrile neutropenia.""","""['Masatomo Nishikawa', 'Hideaki Miyake', 'Masato Fujisawa']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment to Identification of risk factors predicting febrile neutropenia in patients with metastatic germ cell tumors receiving cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.', 'Exploring the optimal sequence of abiraterone and enzalutamide in patients with chemotherapy-naïve castration-resistant prostate cancer: The Kyoto-Baltimore collaboration.', 'Editorial Comment to Identification of risk factors predicting febrile neutropenia in patients with metastatic germ cell tumors receiving cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.', 'The incidence and risk factors of febrile neutropenia in chemotherapy-naïve lung cancer patients receiving etoposide plus platinum.', 'Less nephrotoxicity of paclitaxel and ifosfamide plus nedaplatin for refractory or relapsed germ cell tumors in patients with impaired renal function.', 'Current medical management of patients with poor-risk metastatic germ-cell tumors.', 'High-dose chemotherapy followed by hematological support: experience in the treatment of germ cell tumors.', 'Effects of primary granulocyte-colony stimulating factor prophylaxis on the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients with germ cell tumors.', 'Comparison of Myelotoxicity and Nephrotoxicity Between Daily Low-Dose Cisplatin With Concurrent Radiation and Cyclic High-Dose Cisplatin in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients.', 'Body composition as a predictor of toxicity after treatment with eribulin for advanced soft tissue sarcoma.']"""

We investigated whether the addition of rhenium-188-HEDP to docetaxel/prednisone improved efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with CRPC.  Methods:   Patients with progressive CRPC and osteoblastic bone metastases were randomised for first-line docetaxel 75 mg/m2 3-weekly plus prednisone with or without 2 injections of rhenium-188-HEDP after the third (40 MBq/kg) and after the sixth (20 MBq/kg) cycle of docetaxel. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as either PSA, radiographic or clinical progression. Patients were stratified by extent of bone metastases and hospital.  Results:   Forty-two patients were randomised for standard treatment and 46 patients for combination therapy. Median number of cycles of docetaxel was 9 in the control group and 8 in the experimental group. Median follow-up was 18.4 months. Two patients from the experimental group did not start treatment after randomisation. In the intention to treat analysis no differences in PFS, survival and PSA became apparent between the two groups. In an exploratory per-protocol analysis median overall survival was significantly longer in the experimental group (33.8 months (95%CI 31.75-35.85)) than in the control group (21.0 months (95%CI 13.61-28.39); p 0.012). Also median PFS in patients with a baseline phosphatase >220U/L was significantly better with combination treatment (9.0 months (95%CI 3.92-14.08) versus 6.2 months (95%CI 3.08-9.32); log rank p 0.005). As expected, thrombocytopenia (grade I/II) was reported more frequently in the experimental group (25% versus 0%).

The therapeutic effects are based on suppressing the growth of cancer cells, but, the underlying molecular mechanism has not been fully clarified. To elucidate this mechanism, we investigated the effects of Ad-REIC on the expression of CD147 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Western blotting revealed that the expression of CD147 was significantly suppressed by Ad-REIC. Ad-REIC also suppressed the cell growth of LNCaP cells. Since other researchers have demonstrated that phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and c-Myc protein positively regulate the expression of CD147, we investigated the correlation between the CD147 level and the activation of MAPK and c-Myc expression. Unexpectedly, no positive correlation was observed between CD147 and its possible regulators, suggesting that another signaling pathway was involved in the downregulation of CD147.

This study, funded by VA Health Services Research & Development (HSR&D), seeks to address the need to improve patient-centered survivorship care for veterans with prostate cancer.  Methods/design:   This is a two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a target enrollment of up to 325 prostate cancer survivors per study arm (total anticipated n = 600). Patients will be recruited from four VA sites. Patient eligibility criteria include age range of 40-80 years, one to ten years post-treatment, and currently experiencing prostate cancer symptom burden. We will compare the ""Building Your New Normal"" program, a personally-tailored automated telephone symptom management intervention for improving symptom self-management to usual care enhanced with a non-tailored newsletter about symptom management. Primary outcomes include changes in symptom burden, bother, and health services utilization at five and 12 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes include long-term psychosocial outcomes (e.g. subjective health, perceived cancer control). We will use multivariable regression analysis to evaluate the impact of the intervention on primary and secondary outcomes. We will conduct a process evaluation to understand the effective intervention components and explore possibilities for broader implementation and dissemination.  Discussion:   Our central hypothesis is that intervention group participants will have improved and more confident symptom self-management and prostate cancer quality of life following the intervention and that these outcomes will translate to more efficient use of health services.

Patients and methods:   One hundred seventy-four patients underwent prostate biopsy following salvage whole gland cryoablation of the prostate in the Cryo-OnLine Database registry. Wilcoxon rank-sum and χ2 tests and logistic regression analysis were used to assess predictors of positive biopsy. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) nadir was divided into a statistical tertile for comparisons between different nadir PSA cut points.  Results:   Fifty-two of 174 (29.9%) of this highly select group of men who underwent biopsy had a posttreatment biopsy demonstrating malignant cancer. Men who had positive biopsy following salvage therapy had significantly higher median nadir PSA, shorter median time to prostate biopsy, and shorter median time to biochemical failure. Compared to the lowest tertile (PSA nadir defined as ≤0.1 ng/mL), PSA in the second tertile (0.11-0.8 ng/mL) and third tertile (>0.8 ng/mL) demonstrated increased odds ratio (OR) for positive biopsy, 4.34 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66, 11.4, p = 0.003) and 2.81 (95% CI 1.14, 7.00, p = 0.02), respectively, in adjusted models. In addition, men with a presalvage PSA >20 (OR 7.65; 95% CI 2.03, 28.9; p = 0.003) and Gleason score ≥8 (OR 2.26; 95% CI 0.93, 5.47; p = 0.07) had a higher OR of positive biopsy.  Conclusions:   Nadir PSA of 0.1 ng/mL or less following salvage cryotherapy is predictive of treatment success.

Patients and methods:   The records of 6 943 patients who underwent RP at a European tertiary centre were analysed. Biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastatic disease and CSM were assessed for patients with adverse pathology at RP, and stratified according to preoperative low- vs intermediate-/high-risk PCa groups.

Results:   In patients with extracapsular extension, the metastatic disease rate was 1.6% vs 8% (P < 0.001) and the CSM rate was 2% vs 5% (P = 0.041) for low vs intermediate-/high-risk patients, respectively, at 10 years.

A Cobalt machine combined with an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recently introduced to clinical work. One positive aspect of using non-ionizing imaging devices is the reduction of the patient exposure. The purpose of this study was to quantify the difference in out-of-field dose to the patient between the image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) treatment applied with a linear accelerator with cone beam CT (CBCT) equipment and a Cobalt machine combined with an MRI.  Methods:   The treatment of a rhabdomyosarcoma in the prostate was planned and irradiated using different modalities and radiation therapy machines. The whole-body dose was measured for a 3D-conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), an intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and a volumetric-modulated arc therapy plan applied with a conventional linear accelerator operated at 6 MV beam energy. Additionally, the dose of an IMRT plan applied with a 60 Co machine combined with an MRI was measured. Furthermore, the dose of one CBCT scan using the linear accelerator's on-board imaging system was determined. The 3D dose measurements were performed in an anthropomorphic phantom containing 168 slots for thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs). A combination of LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD100) and LiF:Mg,Cu,P (TLD100H) was used to accurately determine the in- and out-of-field dose. The plans were rescaled to different fractionation schemes (2 Gy, 3 Gy, and 5 Gy fraction dose) and the dose of one CBCT scan was additionally added to the treatment dose per fraction applied with the linear accelerator. The resulting absorbed doses per fraction of the two machines were compared.  Results:   In the target region, all measured treatment plans presented the same magnitude of dose, while the CBCT dose was a factor of 100 smaller. Close to the planned target volume (PTV), the dose from the 60 Co machine was a factor of two higher compared with the 3DCRT + CBCT dose. Up to 45 cm from the PTV, the treatment applied with the 60 Co-sources showed an increased out-of-field dose compared to the linear accelerator + CBCT IGRT treatments. Further away from the PTV in the region where leakage from the gantry head is dominating, the out-of-field dose of the Cobalt machine was smaller compared to the linear accelerator + CBCT.  Conclusion:   The peripheral dose of the 60 Co machine combined with an MRI is larger up to 45 cm from the PTV and further away, it is lower than the dose from a linear accelerator + CBCT treatment. The presented fractionation schemes had a marginal impact on the results.""","""['Pascal Hauri', 'Roger A Hälg', 'Uwe Schneider']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Whole-body dose equivalent including neutrons is similar for 6 MV and 15 MV IMRT, VMAT, and 3D conformal radiotherapy.', 'Whole-body dose and energy measurements in radiotherapy by a combination of LiF:Mg,Cu,P and LiF:Mg,Ti.', 'Interplay effect on a 6-MV flattening-filter-free linear accelerator with high dose rate and fast multi-leaf collimator motion treating breast and lung phantoms.', ""Dose to normal tissues outside the radiation therapy patient's treated volume: a review of different radiation therapy techniques."", 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'MR-guided radiotherapy in rectal cancer: First clinical experience of an innovative technology.', 'Whole-body dose equivalent including neutrons is similar for 6 MV and 15 MV IMRT, VMAT, and 3D conformal radiotherapy.']"""

In Icelandic data, these signals explain ∼7.4% of the population variance in age at menarche, corresponding to ∼25% of the estimated heritability. We implicate ∼250 genes via coding variation or associated expression, demonstrating significant enrichment in neural tissues. Rare variants near the imprinted genes MKRN3 and DLK1 were identified, exhibiting large effects when paternally inherited.

Recently, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) has recommended against routine screening for prostate cancer. We sought to determine how the CTFPHC has impacted the practice patterns among family physicians in the North Simcoe Muskoka (NSM) Local Health Integration Network (LHIN).  Materials and methods:   We surveyed all 439 family physicians within the NSM LHIN as well as 21 residents of the Family Medical Teaching Unit. Surveys were distributed by either mail or fax. Questions covered three sections: 1) demographics, 2) screening practice, and 3) perceptions of screening efficacy.  Results:   The overall survey response rate was 33.3%. In all, 39.5% of physicians felt that prostate cancer screening did not provide a survival benefit, and 13.1% did not offer PSA screening. These beliefs were more likely to be held by younger physicians (age < 45), and those with < 10 years of practice (p < 0.05). Interestingly, female physicians were less likely to believe that PSA screening provided a survival benefit (p ≤ 0.01); however, no gender bias for PSA screening practices was observed (p = 0.73). Of the physicians who agreed with CTFPHC's recommendation (31.8%), 6.0% do not offer PSA screening because of the recommendation. The CTFPHC recommendation had no impact on the age at which physicians begin or stop offering PSA screening (p > 0.05).

Materials and methods:   A dataset of 59 cancer-involved autopsied prostate glands from patients aged 42 to 92 years with prostate volumes of 22 cc to 95 cc was used. An 18 core-systematic biopsy was performed on the first 47 patients, and saturation biopsy protocol of 36 cores was performed on the remainder. Clinically insignificant prostate cancer was defined on whole-mount prostates as Gleason score < 7, total tumor volume ≤ 0.5 cc. Separate counts of 'significant' versus 'insignificant' prostate cancer by both the model-based decision algorithm and the actual data were obtained. These yielded specificity (SP), sensitivity (SE), and concordance values for evaluation of the efficacy of the decision algorithm.  Results:   The model-based decision algorithm yielded SP from 83% to 100%, SE from 62% to 100%, and concordance from 78% to 100%.

Methods:   The medical records of 40 consecutive cases of Ho-TUIP in patients unresponsive to medical treatment were retrospectively reviewed. The efficacy of Ho-TUIP was analyzed according to preoperative factors, including urodynamic parameters. Treatment success was confirmed if overall efficacy demonstrated an improvement that was ""good or greater"" according to the criteria developed by Homma et al. Predictive factors of treatment success were analyzed using logistic regression analysis with demographics, symptom questionnaires, prostate size, and urodynamic parameters.

Our study aimed at evaluating in a population cohort the effect of Italian-style coffee consumption on prostate cancer risk and at investigating in vitro the potential antiproliferative and antimetastatic activity of caffeine on prostate cancer cell lines. 6,989 men of the Moli-sani cohort aged ≥50 years were followed for a mean of 4.24 ± 1.35 years and 100 new prostate cancer cases were identified. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Food Frequency Questionnaire was used for the dietary assessment and the evaluation of Italian-style coffee consumption. Two human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU145, were tested with increasing concentrations of caffeine, and their proliferative/metastatic features were evaluated. The newly diagnosed prostate cancer participants presented lower coffee consumption (60.1 ± 51.3 g/day) compared to the disease-free population (74.0 ± 51.7 g/day) (p < 0.05). Multiadjusted analysis showed that the subjects at highest consumption (>3 cups/day) had 53% lower prostate cancer risk as compared to participants at the lowest consumption (0-2 cups/day) (p = 0.02). Both human prostate cancer cell lines treated with caffeine showed a significant reduction in their proliferative and metastatic behaviors (p < 0.05).

Answers from 3 natural history models""","""Background:   Black men in the United States have substantially higher prostate cancer incidence rates than the general population. The extent to which this incidence disparity is because prostate cancer is more prevalent, more aggressive, and/or more frequently diagnosed in black men is unknown.  Methods:   The authors estimated 3 independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history in black men and in the general population using an updated reconstruction of prostate-specific antigen screening, based on the National Health Interview Survey in 2005 and on prostate cancer incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program during 1975 through 2000. By using the estimated models, the natural history of prostate cancer was compared between black men and the general population.  Results:   The models projected that from 30% to 43% (range across models) of black men develop preclinical prostate cancer by age 85 years, a risk that is (relatively) 28% to 56% higher than that in the general population. Among men who had preclinical disease onset, black men had a similar risk of diagnosis (range, 35%-49%) compared with the general population (32%-44%), but their risk of progression to metastatic disease by the time of diagnosis was from 44% to 75% higher than that in the general population.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer incidence patterns implicate higher incidence of preclinical disease and higher risk of metastatic progression among black men. The findings suggest screening black men earlier than white men and support further research into the benefit-harm tradeoffs of more aggressive screening policies for black men.

All the derivatives were evaluated for cytotoxic activity by MTT assay against five different human cancer cell lines: lung (A549), colon (HCT116), prostate (PC3), pancreatic (MIA PaCa-2) and breast (T47D). The data revealed that compounds 11c, 11d, 11g, 11h and 13a possess most promising cytotoxic potential. The compound 11h was one of the most active compounds, with IC50 values in the range of 4-6µM against all the five cancer cell lines. The results of this study suggested that derivatives with free -OH (11c, 11d and 11g) and free -COOH (11h and 13a) substitutions in the triazole moiety introduced at the C-28 position significantly improved the anti-tumor activity and may be the favourable position to synthesize potent anticancer leads from BA. Introduction of a non polar alkyl groups at C-28 position (10, 12 and 14) resulted in the significant loss of the activity.

A detailed and comprehensive analysis of the microbial ecosystem of the pathologic and healthy prostate tissues has not been yet reported.  Objectives:   To characterize the microbiome possibly associated to the pathologic prostate microenvironment.  Design, setting, and participants:   The microbiome profile of tumor, peri-tumor, and nontumor tissues was assessed on 16 radical prostatectomy-specimens.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Microbiome analysis was assessed by massive ultradeep pyrosequencing. Bacteria load was expressed as a percentage of the total number of bacteria. The statistical significance of differences among specimen-groups was tested with Friedman's test (Dunn posthoc test) and Wilcoxon rank-sum test.  Results and limitations:   Three phyla, six classes, nine orders, 14 families, and 11 genera were above the set threshold value of 1%, respectively. Significant differences in specific microbial populations among tumor/peri-tumor and nontumor prostate specimens were observed at certain taxonomic levels. Among genera, Propionibacterium spp. were the most abundant. Staphylococcus spp. were more represented in the tumor/peri-tumor tissues (p<0.05). The restricted number of specimens represents a potential limitation.  Conclusions:   The prostate contains a plethora of bacteria, which set themselves within the gland with a distribution dependent on the nature of the tissue, thus suggesting a possible pathophysiological correlation between the composition of the local microbial niche and the presence of the tumor itself. Future studies will help to clarify the role of these specific bacteria and their potential to be exploited as new biomarkers.

Patient-reported outcomes including QoL, symptom issues and information needs were collected using validated questionnaires.  Results:   Difficulties with all QoL domains were more prevalent amongst cancer survivors compared with the general population, particularly difficulties with usual activities (28 vs 15%) and anxiety or depression (35 vs 22%). Symptoms such as trouble sleeping, always feeling tired, trouble concentrating and fear of cancer recurrence persisted up to 5 years post-diagnosis. Factors associated with reduced QoL included having another long-standing health condition, cancer not responding fully to treatment, not having or not being certain of having a written care plan and being female.

Progranulin, a secreted growth factor, strongly binds the heparin-sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, and counteracts its biological activity. We established that progranulin acts as an autocrine growth factor and promotes prostate cancer cell motility, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. Progranulin was overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues vis-à-vis non-neoplastic tissues supporting the hypothesis that progranulin may play a key role in prostate cancer progression. However, progranulin's mode of action is not well understood and proteins regulating progranulin signaling have not been identified. Sortilin, a single-pass type I transmembrane protein of the Vps10 family, binds progranulin in neurons and targets progranulin for lysosomal degradation. Significantly, in DU145 and PC3 cells, we detected very low levels of sortilin associated with high levels of progranulin production and enhanced motility. Restoring sortilin expression decreased progranulin levels, inhibited motility and anchorage-independent growth and destabilized Akt. These results demonstrated a critical role for sortilin in regulating progranulin and suggest that sortilin loss may contribute to prostate cancer progression. Here, we provide the novel observation that progranulin downregulated sortilin protein levels independent of transcription. Progranulin induced sortilin ubiquitination, internalization via clathrin-dependent endocytosis and sorting into early endosomes for lysosomal degradation. Collectively, these results constitute a regulatory feed-back mechanism whereby sortilin downregulation ensures sustained progranulin-mediated oncogenesis.""","""['Ryuta Tanimoto', 'Chiara Palladino', 'Shi-Qiong Xu', 'Simone Buraschi', 'Thomas Neill', 'Leonard G Gomella', 'Stephen C Peiper', 'Antonino Belfiore', 'Renato V Iozzo', 'Andrea Morrione']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Matrix Biol""","""['Sortilin regulates progranulin action in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'C-terminus of progranulin interacts with the beta-propeller region of sortilin to regulate progranulin trafficking.', 'The Interaction Between Progranulin with Sortilin and the Lysosome.', 'The interactomics of sortilin: an ancient lysosomal receptor evolving new functions.', 'Met receptor: a moving target.', 'Progranulin and EGFR modulate receptor-like tyrosine kinase sorting and stability in mesothelioma cells.', 'Progranulin Oncogenic Network in Solid Tumors.', ""Heparan sulfate proteoglycan in Alzheimer's disease: aberrant expression and functions in molecular pathways related to amyloid-β metabolism."", 'Complexity of progranulin mechanisms of action in mesothelioma.', 'Deciphering Mechanisms of Action of Sortilin/Neurotensin Receptor-3 in the Proliferation Regulation of Colorectal and Other Cancers.']"""

Methods and materials:   ASCENDE-RT (Androgen Suppression Combined with Elective Nodal and Dose Escalated Radiation Therapy) enrolled 398 men, median age 68 years, who were then randomized to either a standard arm that included 12 months of androgen deprivation therapy and pelvic irradiation to 46 Gy followed by a dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy (DE-EBRT) boost to 78 Gy, or an experimental arm that substituted a low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (LDR-PB) boost. At clinic visits, investigators recorded GU and GI morbidity and information on urinary continence, catheter use, and erectile function. Exclusion of 15 who received nonprotocol treatment and correction of 14 crossover events left 195 men who actually received a DE-EBRT boost and 188, an LDR-PB boost. Median follow-up was 6.5 years.  Results:   The LDR-PB boost increased the risk of needing temporary catheterization and/or requiring incontinence pads. At 5 years the cumulative incidence of grade 3 GU events was 18.4% for LDR-PB, versus 5.2% for DE-EBRT (P<.001). Compared with the cumulative incidence, the 5-year prevalence of grade 3 GU morbidity was substantially lower for both arms (8.6% vs 2.2%, P=.058). The 5-year cumulative incidence of grade 3 GI events was 8.1% for LDR-PB, versus 3.2% for DE-EBRT (P=.124). The 5-year prevalence of grade 3 GI toxicity was lower than the cumulative incidence for both arms (1.0% vs 2.2%, respectively). Among men reporting adequate baseline erections, 45% of LDR-PB patients reported similar erectile function at 5 years, versus 37% after DE-EBRT (P=.30).  Conclusions:   The incidence of acute and late GU morbidity was higher after LDR-PB boost, and there was a nonsignificant trend for worse GI morbidity.

A biomarker that can facilitate early detection of TCC/PCA and improve patient survival would be useful. S100A8/A9 (calgranulin A/B or calprotectin) and S100A12 (calgranulin C) are expressed by cells of the innate immune system and are associated with several inflammatory disorders. S100A8/A9 is also expressed by epithelial cells after malignant transformation and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and metastasis. S100A8/A9 is up-regulated in human PCA and TCC, whereas the results for S100A12 have been ambiguous. Also, the urine S100A8/A9-to-S100A12 ratio (uCalR) may have potential as a marker for canine TCC/PCA. Aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the urinary S100/calgranulins to detect TCC/PCA in dogs by using data and urine samples from 164 dogs with TCC/PCA, non-neoplastic urinary tract disease, other neoplasms, or urinary tract infections, and 75 healthy controls (nested case-control study).

Results:   S100A8/A9USG had the highest sensitivity (96%) and specificity (66%) to detect TCC/PCA, with specificity reaching 75% after excluding dogs with a urinary tract infection. The uCalR best distinguished dogs with TCC/PCA from dogs with a urinary tract infection (sensitivity: 91%, specificity: 60%). Using a S100A8/A9USG ≥ 109.9 to screen dogs ≥6 years of age for TCC/PCA yielded a negative predictive value of 100%.

The sensor relies on cysteamine capped gold nanoparticles (N-AuNPs) covalently linked with anti-PSMA antibody (Ab) for target specificity. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channel is used to efficiently and reproducibly introduce sample containing soluble proteins/cells to the sensor.

It has become a challenge to comprehend such a rapid expansion of the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the conceptual content of National Health Insurance Research Database-based cancer research, using the abstract of articles extracted from PubMed between 2002 and 2015. Search terms including ""National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) AND Taiwan,"" ""Taiwan AND population-based,"" and ""Taiwan AND nationwide"" were used to search in PubMed with the publication date limited to between 1997 and 2015. The retrieved articles were manually screened to retain only those that were cancer-related and were based on secondary data analysis of the NHIRD. A total 589 articles were selected for subsequent text mining using the R software. Among the 589 articles, the top 5 most studied cancer types were breast (16.3%), lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.4%), liver (8.3%), and prostate (7.5%). The articles that received the highest number of citations by PubMed Central articles were cited 92 times. The top 3 most frequently occurred keywords in the abstracts of the 589 articles were cancer, patient, and risk, with 3670, 2535, and 1652 times, respectively. Analysis of key conception indicated that the most common conceptions were diabetes, survival, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. In conclusion, in this study of 589 published articles on secondary data analysis of the NHIRD, indexed by PubMed between 2002 and 2015, we found that while the risk factors of cancer, treatment of cancer, and survival of cancer patients were popular research topics, end-of-life cancer care issues were less studied. Further studies should explore these areas since they are as important as treatment of the disease itself for many patients.""","""['Jui-Kun Chiang', 'Chih-Wen Lin', 'Chun-Lung Wang', 'Malcolm Koo', 'Yee-Hsin Kao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""[""Two Decades of Research Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Claims Data: Bibliometric and Text Mining Analysis on PubMed."", 'Understanding the productive author who published papers in medicine using National Health Insurance Database: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Perioperative medicine and Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database.', 'Decision to adopt medical technology under the National Health Insurance System in Taiwan: case study of new molecular targeted drugs among non-small cell lung cancer patients.', 'A bibliometric analysis of acupuncture research in Taiwan from 1988 to 2017.', 'Using PIM-Taiwan, PRISCUS, and Beers criteria to assess potentially inappropriate medication use among older adults with 90-day rehospitalization: a population-based study in Taiwan.', 'Investigating the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy for patients with hormone receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ.', 'Medical Insurance Information Systems in China: Mixed Methods Study.', 'Tracking knowledge evolution, hotspots and future directions of emerging technologies in cancers research: a bibliometrics review.', 'Dose-Dependent Relationship Between Metformin and Colorectal Cancer Occurrence Among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes-A Nationwide Cohort Study.']"""

The study contains data for 118 patients where the HDRBT CT was deformably-registered to the EBRT CT. The EBRT and registered HDRBT TG43 dose distributions in a reference 2 Gy/fraction were 3D-summed. Rectum dose-surface maps (DSMs) were obtained by virtually unfolding the rectum surface slice-by-slice. Associations with late peak gastrointestinal toxicities were investigated using voxel-wise DSM analysis as well as parameterised spatial patterns. The latter were obtained by thresholding DSMs from 1-80 Gy (increment = 1) and extracting inferior-superior extent, left-right extent, area, perimeter, compactness, circularity and ellipse fit parameters. Logistic regressions and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to correlate features with toxicities. Rectal bleeding, stool frequency, diarrhoea and urgency/tenesmus were associated with greater lateral and/or longitudinal spread of the high doses near the anterior rectal surface. Rectal bleeding and stool frequency were also influenced by greater low-intermediate doses to the most inferior 20% of the rectum and greater low-intermediate-high doses to 40-80% of the rectum length respectively. Greater low-intermediate doses to the superior 20% and inferior 20% of the rectum length were associated with anorectal pain and urgency/tenesmus respectively. Diarrhoea, completeness of evacuation and proctitis were also related to greater low doses to the posterior side of the rectum. Spatial features for the intermediate-high dose regions such as area, perimeter, compactness, circularity, ellipse eccentricity and confinement to ellipse fits were strongly associated with toxicities other than anorectal pain. Consequently, toxicity is related to the shape of isodoses as well as dose coverage. The findings indicate spatial constraints on doses to certain sections of the rectum may be important for reducing toxicities and optimising dose.""","""['Calyn R Moulton', 'Michael J House', 'Victoria Lye', 'Colin I Tang', 'Michele Krawiec', 'David J Joseph', 'James W Denham', 'Martin A Ebert']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Prostate external beam radiotherapy combined with high-dose-rate brachytherapy: dose-volume parameters from deformably-registered plans correlate with late gastrointestinal complications.', 'Accumulation of rectum dose-volume metrics for prostate external beam radiotherapy combined with brachytherapy: Evaluating deformably registered dose distribution addition using parameter-based addition.', 'Avoidance of late rectal toxicity after high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost treatment for prostate cancer.', 'Late rectal toxicity after low-dose-rate brachytherapy: incidence, predictors, and management of side effects.', 'Curative radiotherapy of localized prostate cancer.

Evidence of associations between income and HRQOL among patients with prostate cancer (PCa) is sparse and their explanations still remain unclear.  Methods:   246 males of two German hospitals filled out a questionnaire at the time of acute treatment, 6 and 12 months later. Age, partnership status, baseline disease and treatment factors, physical and psychological comorbidities, as well as treatment factors and adverse effects at follow-up were additionally included in the analyses to explain potential disparities. HRQOL was assessed with the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) QLQ-C30 core questionnaire and the prostate-specific QLQ-PR25. A linear mixed model for repeated measures was calculated.  Results:   The fixed effects showed highly significant income-related inequalities regarding the majority of HRQOL scales. Less affluent PCa patients reported lower HRQOL in terms of global quality of life, all functional scales and urinary symptoms. After introducing relevant covariates, some associations became insignificant (physical, cognitive and sexual function), while others only showed reduced estimates (global quality of life, urinary symptoms, role, emotional and social function). In particular, mental disorders/psychological comorbidity played a relevant role in the explanation of income-related disparities.  Conclusions:   One year after surgery, income-related disparities in various dimensions of HRQOL persist. With respect to economically disadvantaged PCa patients, the findings emphasize the importance of continuous psychosocial screening and tailored interventions, of patients' empowerment and improved access to supportive care.""","""['Jens Klein', 'Daniel Lüdecke', 'Kerstin Hofreuter-Gätgens', 'Margit Fisch', 'Markus Graefen', 'Olaf von dem Knesebeck']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Socioeconomic status and health-related quality of life among patients with prostate cancer 6\u2005months after radical prostatectomy: a longitudinal analysis.', 'Standardising the Assessment of Patient-reported Outcome Measures in Localised Prostate Cancer.

Materials and methods:   We describe an e-Science initiative in Sweden, e-Science for Cancer Prevention and Control (eCPC), which supports biomarker discovery and offers decision support for personalized intervention strategies. The generic eCPC contribution is a workflow with 4 nodes applied iteratively, and the concept of e-Science signifies systematic use of tools from the mathematical, statistical, data, and computer sciences.  Results:   The eCPC workflow is illustrated through 2 case studies. For prostate cancer, an in-house personalized screening tool, the Stockholm-3 model (S3M), is presented as an alternative to prostate-specific antigen testing alone. S3M is evaluated in a trial setting and plans for rollout in the population are discussed. For breast cancer, new biomarkers based on breast density and molecular profiles are developed and the US multicenter Women Informed to Screen Depending on Measures (WISDOM) trial is referred to for evaluation. While current eCPC data management uses a traditional data warehouse model, we discuss eCPC-developed features of a coherent data integration platform.  Discussion and conclusion:   E-Science tools are a key part of an evidence-based process for personalized medicine. This paper provides a structured workflow from data and models to evaluation of new personalized intervention strategies. The importance of multidisciplinary collaboration is emphasized.

Methods:   We identified 1302166 patients with diagnoses of nonhematologic malignancies originating outside of the CNS between 2010 and 2013 and described the incidence proportion and survival of patients with brain metastases.  Results:   We identified 26430 patients with brain metastases at diagnosis of cancer. Patients with small cell and non-small cell lung cancer displayed the highest rates of identified brain metastases at diagnosis; among patients presenting with metastatic disease, patients with melanoma (28.2%), lung adenocarcinoma (26.8%), non-small cell lung cancer not otherwise specified/other lung cancer (25.6%), small cell lung cancer (23.5%), squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (15.9%), bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (15.5%), and renal cancer (10.8%) had an incidence proportion of identified brain metastases of >10%.

Circulating growth hormone (GH) has a permissive role in PCa development in animal models and in human PCa xenograft growth. As GH and GH receptor (GHR) are both expressed in PCa cells, we assessed whether prostatic GH production is linked to AR activity and whether GH contributes to the castration-resistant phenotype. Using online datasets, we found that GH is highly expressed in human CRPC. We observed increased GH expression in castration-resistant C4-2 compared with castration-sensitive LNCaP cells as well as in enzalutamide (MDV3100)-resistant (MDVR) C4-2B (C4-2B MDVR) cells compared with parental C4-2B. We describe a negative regulation of locally produced GH by androgens/AR in PCa cells following treatment with AR agonists (R1881) and antagonists (enzalutamide, bicalutamide). We also show that GH enhances invasive behavior of CRPC 22Rv1 cells, as reflected by increased migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth, as well as expression of matrix metalloproteases. Moreover, GH induces expression of the AR splice variant 7, which correlates with antiandrogen resistance, and also induces insulinlike growth factor 1, which is implicated in PCa progression and ligand-independent AR activation.

It also aims to evaluate the reliability of therapists in rating motor control of pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) using real time ultrasound imaging (RUSI) video clips. We further determine predictors of acquiring motor control.  Methods:   Ninety-one men diagnosed with prostate cancer attending a physiotherapy clinic for pelvic floor exercises were taught detailed pelvic floor motor control exercises by a physiotherapist using trans-abdominal RUSI for biofeedback. A new protocol to rate motor control skill acquisition was developed. Three independent physiotherapists assessed motor control skill attainment by viewing RUSI videos of the contractions. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated using intra-class correlation coefficients. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of successful skill attainment. Acquisition of the skill was compared between pre- and post-operative participants using an independent-group t-test.  Results:   There was good reliability for rating the RUSI video clips (ICC 0.73 (95%CI 0.59-0.82)) for experienced therapists. Having low BMI and being seen pre-operatively predicted motor skill attainment, accounting for 46.3% of the variance. Significantly more patients trained pre-operatively acquired the skill of pelvic floor control compared with patients initially seen post-operatively (OR 11.87, 95%CI 1.4 to 99.5, p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   A new protocol to evaluate attainment of pelvic floor control in men with prostate cancer can be assessed reliably from RUSI images, and is most effectively delivered pre-operatively.""","""['Stuart Doorbar-Baptist', 'Roger Adams', 'Trudy Rebbeck']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Physiother Theory Pract""","""['A pilot randomized trial of conventional versus advanced pelvic floor exercises to treat urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: a study protocol.', 'Assessing muscle function of the male pelvic floor using real time ultrasound.', 'Effect of preoperative pelvic floor muscle therapy with biofeedback versus standard care on stress urinary incontinence and quality of life in men undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a randomised control trial.', 'Pre-Operative Pelvic Floor Muscle Training--A Review.', 'Pelvic muscle exercise/biofeedback for urinary incontinence after prostatectomy: an education program.', 'Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Sonofeedback Method in the Treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence in Women-Preliminary Report.', 'Preoperative exercise interventions to optimize continence outcomes following radical prostatectomy.', 'The Efficacy of the WeChat App Combined with Pelvic Floor Muscle Exercise for the Urinary Incontinence after Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study included 532 patients: 266 patients received CB with IRLA and 266 patients PPNB with IRLA. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was applied to prospectively evaluate pain (1) at induction of anesthesia, (2) at insertion of the TRUS probe, (3) at needle penetration to the prostate, and (4) throughout the biopsy procedure. Pain scores were compared to evaluate differences between groups. The secondary endpoint of serious complication rate was also evaluated. As a subanalysis, the pain scores were compared in patients with high body mass index (BMI ≥25 kg/m²).  Results:   Overall, the pain score in the PPNB group was significantly lower than in the CB group at induction of anesthesia (mean ± SD: 2.0 ± 1.9 vs 2.9 ± 2.1, p = .0001) but higher at insertion of the TRUS probe (2.7 ± 2.5 vs 1.9 ± 1.7, p = .009). The pain score did not differ significantly between groups at needle penetration or throughout the biopsy. Univariate analyses indicated no significant association between VAS scores and patient demographics. Overall rates of serious complications did not differ between the two groups (5.6% vs 5.3%, p = .85). In patients with high BMI, the pain score was significantly lower in the PPNB group than in the CB group throughout the procedure (2.5 ± 2.0 vs 3.5 ± 2.5, p = .03).

We present our data on ALDH1A3 as a potential therapeutic target for the prostate cancer based on several functional investigations. Also, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets for primary prostate cancer to detect the relevance of ALDH1A3 and prostate cancer luminal phenotype. We found that ALDH1A3 correlated with androgen receptor signaling pathway in primary prostate cancer, which is consistent with its luminal layer localization. Then, from the genetic manipulation assay, we knocked out the ALDH1A3 in PC-3 cells and found significantly reduced proliferation rate as well as the invasion ability. Furthermore, we looked up our single center primary prostate cancer post-operative follow-up data and suggested that the high level ALDH1A3 expression could predict the poor progression-free survival in a 158-patient cohort. We concluded that ALDH1A3, localized in luminal layer in prostate epithelium, is highly expressed in prostate cancer.

In the present study, novel magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers (MMIPs) with good biocompatibility were produced for the selective separation and inhibition of testosterone in prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   MMIPs were prepared by using magnetic nanospheres, gelatin, and testosterone as the supporting materials, functional monomer, and the template molecule, respectively. The characterization of the resultant products was investigated by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and vibrating sample magnetometry. To test whether MMIPs can remove testosterone in biologic samples, human LNCaP (androgen-dependent) and C4-2 (androgen-independent) prostate cancer cells were selected as cell models. The translocation of androgen receptor (AR) was detected by immunofluorescence assay, and the expression of PSA mRNA was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cell flow cytometry analysis was performed to detect cell cycle arrest.  Results:   The synthesized nanomaterials (MMIPs) possessed high crystallinity, satisfactory superparamagnetic properties, and uniform imprinted shell, and exhibited high adsorption capacity, fast kinetics, and high selectivity for testosterone. Moreover, the obtained imprinted nanomaterials could selectively enrich and detect testosterone in the LNCaP cell samples as a solid-phase extractant coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography. In addition, the MMIPs could freely enter prostate cancer cells and suppress the translocation of AR into the cell nucleus. We further found that MMIPs inhibited upregulation of AR downstream target genes in LNCaP and C4-2 cells; also, MMIPs inhibited cell growth and induced obvious cell cycle arrest in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells, but had no obvious effect on androgen-independent C4-2 cells.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that the obtained imprinted nanomaterials can specifically and effectively bind testosterone and recover it from prostate cancer cells. Moreover, the MMIPs can freely enter prostate cancer cells and block the activation of testosterone-AR pathway. Thus, the MMIPs may be a new option for antiandrogen therapy in prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaoshuang Tang', 'Feng Li', 'Jing Jia', 'Chao Yang', 'Wei Liu', 'Ben Jin', 'Xinyang Wang', 'Ruixia Gao', 'Dalin He', 'Peng Guo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Preparation of magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer for selective recognition of resveratrol in wine.', 'Selective separation and determination of glucocorticoids in cosmetics using dual-template magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers and HPLC.', 'Preparation and application of magnetic molecular imprinted polymers for extraction of cephalexin from pork and milk samples.', 'Synthesis and application of magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers in sample preparation.', 'Magnetic Molecularly Imprinted Polymers: An Update on Their Use in the Separation of Active Compounds from Natural Products.', 'Advanced bioactive nanomaterials for biomedical applications.', 'Advanced bioactive nanomaterials for diagnosis and treatment of major chronic diseases.', 'In Vivo Applications of Molecularly Imprinted Polymers for Drug Delivery: A Pharmaceutical Perspective.', 'Modification of Cotton Fabric with Molecularly Imprinted Polymer-Coated Carbon Dots as a Sensor for 17 α-methyltestosterone.', 'Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanoparticles: An Emerging Versatile Platform for Cancer Therapy.']"""

As the expression of miR-221 directly correlated with CD44 in HCC cells, we hypothesized that miR-221 may directly or indirectly regulate CD44 expression. Inhibition of miR-221 with antisense in Sk-Hep-1 or SNU-449 cell lines reduced CD44 protein expression while miR-221 mimic increased CD44 protein levels. miR-221 antisense did not alter the CD44 mRNA levels in Sk-Hep-1 or SNU-449 cells suggesting that regulation of CD44 protein occurs post transcriptionally. To discover miRNAs that may be involved in the miR-221 regulation of CD44, we performed miRNA profiling in SNU-449 cells treated with anti-miR-221. Several miRNAs were increased with miR-221 inhibition including miR-708-5p, a miRNA that targets CD44. As miR-221 targets several regulators of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and a link between this pathway and CD44 has been previously shown in prostate cancer, we considered miR-221 regulation of CD44 may be through this pathway. Inhibition of miR-221 reduced p-4EBP1, a downstream effector of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.

The purpose of our study was to investigate the feasibility of obtaining valid measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) and finite element analysis-derived bone strength of the hip and spine using PET/CT examinations of prostate cancer patients by comparing against values obtained using routine multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) scans-as validated in previous studies-as a reference standard.  Materials and methods:   Men with prostate cancer (n=82, 71.6±8.3 years) underwent Fluorine-18 NaF PET/CT and routine MDCT within three months. Femoral neck and total hip areal BMD, vertebral trabecular BMD and femur and vertebral strength based on finite element analysis were assessed in 63 paired PET/CT and MDCT examinations using phantomless calibration and Biomechanical-CT analysis. Men with osteoporosis or fragile bone strength identified at either the hip or spine (vertebral trabecular BMD ≤80mg/cm3, femoral neck or total hip T-score ≤-2.5, vertebral strength ≤6500N and femoral strength ≤3500N, respectively) were considered to be at high risk of fracture. PET/CT- versus MDCT-based BMD and strength measurements were compared using paired t-tests, linear regression and by generating Bland-Altman plots. Agreement in fracture-risk classification was assessed in a contingency table.  Results:   All measurements from PET/CT versus MDCT were strongly correlated (R2=0.93-0.97; P<0.0001 for all). Mean differences for total hip areal BMD (0.001g/cm2, 1.1%), femoral strength (-60N, 1.3%), vertebral trabecular BMD (2mg/cm3, 2.6%) and vertebral strength (150N; 1.7%) measurements were not statistically significant (P>0.05 for all), whereas the mean difference in femoral neck areal BMD measurements was small but significant (-0.018g/cm2; -2.5%; P=0.007). The agreement between PET/CT and MDCT for fracture-risk classification was 97% (0.89 kappa for repeatability).  Conclusion:   Ancillary analyses of BMD, bone strength, and fracture risk agreed well between PET/CT and MDCT, suggesting that PET/CT can be used opportunistically to comprehensively assess bone integrity.

Methods: Cytotoxicity of Euphorbia triaculeata plant extract was investigated by employing MTT assay and the genotoxicity was assessed by using comet assay. Results: Both toxicity tests exhibited significant toxicity results. In the comet assay, the Euphorbia triaculeata extract exhibited genotoxic effects against MCF-7 DNA and PC 3 but not on HEPG2 cell lines in a time-dependent manner by increasing the mean percentage of DNA damage. Euphorbia triaculeata extract showed significant toxicity against cancer cells. Comparison with positive control signifies that cytotoxicity exhibited by methanol extract might have moderate activity. Conclusion: The present work confirmed the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of Euphorbia triaculeata plant. However, the observed toxicity of this plant extract needs to be confirmed by additional studies. Based on our results, further examination of the potential anticancer properties of Euphorbia triaculeata plant species and the identification of the active ingredients of these extracts is warranted.""","""['Zarraq I A Al-Faifi', 'Yahya S Masrahi', 'Magdy Sayed Aly', 'Turki A Al-Turki', 'Tarek Dardeer']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Evaluation of genotoxicity of Euphorbia triaculeata Forssk. extract on mice bone marrow cells in vivo.', 'Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assessment of Euphorbia hirta in MCF-7 cell line model using comet assay.', 'Cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of ethanolic extract of Euphorbia hyssopifolia L. on HepG2 cells.', 'Evaluation of the cytotoxicity, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptotic induction by Euphorbia hirta in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.', 'Final report on the safety assessment of capsicum annuum extract, capsicum annuum fruit extract, capsicum annuum resin, capsicum annuum fruit powder, capsicum frutescens fruit, capsicum frutescens fruit extract, capsicum frutescens resin, and capsaicin.', 'Antifungal and Cytotoxic Activity of Diterpenes and Bisnorsesquiterpenoides from the Latex of Euphorbia resinifera Berg.', 'Evaluation of genotoxicity of Euphorbia triaculeata Forssk. extract on mice bone marrow cells in vivo.']"""

Low-molecular-weight chemicals represent an attractive therapeutic option, as they are readily accessible to organic synthesis and can easily be characterized.1 Their potency as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties can be systematically and rationally investigated and ultimately optimized via expert science behind medicinal chemistry and methods of computer-aided drug design (CADD). In recent years, significant advances in molecular modeling techniques have afforded a variety of tools to effectively identify potential binding pockets on prospective targets, to map key interactions between ligands and their binding sites, to construct and assess energetics of the resulting complexes, to predict ADMET properties of candidate compounds, and to systematically analyze experimental and computational data to derive meaningful structure-activity relationships leading to the creation of a drug candidate. This Perspective describes a real case of a drug discovery campaign accomplished in a relatively short time with limited resources. The study integrated an arsenal of available molecular modeling techniques with an array of experimental tools to successfully develop a novel class of potent and selective androgen receptor inhibitors with a novel mode of action. It resulted in the largest academic licensing deal in Canadian history, totaling $142M. This project exemplifies the importance of team science, an integrative approach to drug discovery, and the use of best practices in CADD. We posit that the lessons learned and best practices for executing an effective CADD project can be applied, with similar success, to many drug discovery projects in both academia and industry.""","""['Fuqiang Ban', 'Kush Dalal', 'Huifang Li', 'Eric LeBlanc', 'Paul S Rennie', 'Artem Cherkasov']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Chem Inf Model""","""['Computer-aided drug discovery research at a global contract research organization.', 'Importance of molecular computer modeling in anticancer drug development.', 'Overview on the current status of virtual high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry approaches in multi-target anticancer drug discovery; Part I.', 'Urgency and austerity as drivers of success.', 'Recent progress in the development of protein-protein interaction inhibitors targeting androgen receptor-coactivator binding in prostate cancer.', 'PopShift: A thermodynamically sound approach to estimate binding free energies by accounting for ligand-induced population shifts from a ligand-free MSM.', 'Automated machine learning approach for developing a quantitative structure-activity relationship model for cardiac steroid inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase.', ""The 'Big Bang' of the chemical universe."", 'Cytotoxic Potential of Bioactive Compounds from Aspergillus flavus, an Endophytic Fungus Isolated from Cynodon dactylon, against Breast Cancer: Experimental and Computational Approach.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

They were long regarded as transcription noise for their low expression and non-protein coding features. Recent published reports indicate that lncRNAs are involved in virtually every aspect of human biology. We aimed to profile the endometrial lncRNA expression pattern in women with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and predict the function of the genes of the dysregulated lncRNA transcripts. Endometrial samples (24) were collected during window of implantation (14 RIF women and 10 women who conceived after embryo transfer). For the microarray study, 7 RIF endometrium and 5 control endometrium were selected, and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on the rest of the endometrial samples to validate the microarray results. After that, lncRNA-mRNA co-expression analysis, GO analysis, KEGG analysis, and lncRNA-transcript factor (TF) analysis were carried out to analyze the gene functions of the dysregulated lncRNA transcripts. We detected a total of 197 lncRNA transcripts that were dysregulated in RIF endometrium compared with the control group. The relative expression levels of eight selected lncRNA transcripts were validated by RT-qPCR and were in accordance with the microarray outcomes. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that the coexpressed mRNA transcripts were involved in pathways that may affect endometrial receptivity such as cell adhesion. The lncRNA target predictions provided potential TF targets of the dysregulated lncRNA transcripts. Our results indicate that lncRNA expression profiles of RIF endometrium were different from that of normal receptive endometrial, suggesting that lncRNAs may regulate endometrial receptivity.

In the present study, the effect of matrine and LY294002 on the expression of the Akt/FoxO3a signaling pathway was examined by western blot analyses and RT-PCR. We discovered that matrine significantly inhibited the proliferation of both prostate cancer cell line PC-3 and prostate epithelial cell line RWPE1, induced apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest. In addition, LY294002 was found to enhance the effect of matrine. Furthermore, the effects of matrine on the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis were more effective on PC-3 than on RWPE1 cells. Compared to RWPE1 cells, matrine exerted a more powerful influence on PC-3 cells in increasing the expression of the relevant protein. Our data suggested that FoxO3a-Bim and FoxO3a-P27 may mediate matrine-inhibited proliferation of CRPC cells by activating cell apoptosis and inducing cell cycle arrest.

The cancer stem cells (CSCs) have properties necessary for tumor initiation, resistance to therapy, and progression. HER/ERBB‑elicited signaling supports CSC properties. Our previous studies revealed that secretory phospholipase A2 group IIa (sPLA2‑IIa) is overexpressed in both prostate and lung cancer cells, leading to an aberrant high level in the interstitial fluid, i.e., tumor microenvironment and blood. HER/ERBB-PI3K-Akt-NF-κB signaling stimulates sPLA2‑IIa overexpression, and in turn, sPLA2‑IIa activates EGFR family receptors and HER/ERBB-elicited signaling and stimulates sPLA2‑IIa overexpression in a positive feedback manner. The present study determined the molecular mechanisms of sPLA2‑IIa in stimulating HER/ERBB-elicited signaling and supporting CSC properties. We found that sPLA2‑IIa binds both EGFR and HER3 demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and also indirectly interacts with HER2, suggesting that sPLA2‑IIa functions as a ligand for both EGFR and HER3. Furthermore, both side population CSCs from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 and H1975 cells and ALDH1‑high CSCs from castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) 22Rv1 cells overexpress sPLA2‑IIa and produce tumors when inoculated into subcutis of nude mice. Given an aberrant high level of sPLA2‑IIa in the tumor microenvironment that should be much higher than that in the blood, our findings support the notion that sPLA2‑IIa functions as a ligand for EGFR family receptors and supports CSC properties via HER/ERBB-elicited signaling, which may contribute to resistance to therapy and cancer progression.""","""['Shan Lu', 'Zhongyun Dong']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Secretory phospholipase A2-IIa upregulates HER/HER2-elicited signaling in lung cancer cells.', 'Secretory phospholipase A2-IIa is a target gene of the HER/HER2-elicited pathway and a potential plasma biomarker for poor prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'Androgen-independent prostate cancer cells circumvent EGFR inhibition by overexpression of alternative HER receptors and ligands.', 'Update on HER-kinase-directed therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting HER proteins in cancer therapy and the role of the non-target HER3.', 'Non-Targeted Serum Lipidomics Analysis and Potential Biomarkers of Laryngeal Cancer Based on UHPLC-QTOF-MS.', 'Human Group IIA Phospholipase A2-Three Decades on from Its Discovery.', 'Interplay of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 in Prostate Cancer: Beyond Androgen Receptor Transactivation.', 'Phospholipase A2 Drives Tumorigenesis and Cancer Aggressiveness through Its Interaction with Annexin A1.', 'Comparison of sPLA2IIA performance with high-sensitive CRP neutrophil percentage PCT and lactate to identify bacterial infection.']"""

Traditional biopsy-based selection criteria have been criticized for inaccurate determination of cancer grade and extent. We evaluated the incremental benefit of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in patient selection using various AS criteria.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated men who received mpMRI before radical prostatectomy between 2011 and 2014. Patients were classified as suitable for AS using four criteria: (1) Epstein, (2) National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) low-risk or (3) extended criteria (Gleason ⩽3+4, PSA ⩽15 ng/ml, clinical stage ⩽T2b) using clinical parameters. The incremental value of mpMRI was evaluated against the referent standard of surgical pathology in determining suitability for AS using sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LRs) and area under receiver operating curves (AUCs).  Results:   We evaluated 208 men. Only one man fulfilled Epstein criteria (1) at pathology, who was neither identified using clinical criteria nor mpMRI. Using (2), clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 80%, specificity 75%, LR+ 3.3, LR- 0.3, AUC 0.78, while combined clinical-mpMRI criteria achieved a sensitivity of 80%, specificity 99.5% (P<0.01), LR+ 162, LR- 0.2 and AUC 0.90 (P<0.01 compared to clinical).

This retrospective study was conducted in patients who underwent M-TURP at Peking University First Hospital between 2003 and 2013. A total of 1680 patients who had undergone M-TURP were identified, including 539 patients in the noncystostomy group and 1141 patients in the cystostomy group. After propensity score matching, the number of patients in each group was 456. Smaller reductions in hemoglobin and hematocrit (10.9 g vs 17.6 g and 3.6% vs 4.7%, respectively) were found in the noncystostomy group. In addition, patients undergoing surgery without cystostomy had their catheters removed earlier (4.6 days vs 5.2 days), required shorter postoperative stays in the hospital (5.1 days vs 6.0 days), and were at lower risk of operative complications (5.7% vs 9.2%), especially bleeding requiring blood transfusion (2.9% vs 6.1%). Similar findings were observed in cohorts of prostates of 30-80 ml and prostates >80 ml. Furthermore, among patients with a resection weight >42.5 g or surgical time >90 min, or even propensity-matched patients based on surgical time, those with cystostomy seemed to be at a higher risk of operative complications. These results suggest that M-TURP without suprapubic cystostomy is a safe and effective method, even among patients with larger prostates, heavier estimated resection weights, and longer surgical times.""","""['Run-Qi Guo', 'Yi-Sen Meng', 'Wei Yu', 'Kai Zhang', 'Ben Xu', 'Yun-Xiang Xiao', 'Shi-Liang Wu', 'Bai-Nian Pan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['A Novel Modification of Transurethral Enucleation and Resection of the Prostate in Patients With Prostate Glands Larger than 80\u2009mL: Surgical Procedures and Clinical Outcomes.', 'Value of suprapubic cystostomy in bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia below 80 gram.', 'Radical prostatectomy after previous transurethral resection of the prostate: robot-assisted laparoscopic versus open radical prostatectomy in a matched-pair analysis.', 'Monopolar transurethral resection of the big prostate, experience at Prince Hussein Bin Abdullah Urology Center.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Transurethral Procedures for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Resulting from Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Update.']"""

However, the safety and benefit of cytoreduction in metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) has not been proven. Therefore, we evaluated the incidence of complications following CRP in men newly diagnosed with mPCa. A total of 68 patients who underwent CRP from 2006 to 2014 at four tertiary surgical centers were compared to 598 men who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa). Urinary incontinence was defined as the use of any pad. CRP had longer operative times (200 min vs 140 min, P < 0.0001) and higher estimated blood loss (250 ml vs 125 ml, P < 0.0001) compared to the control group. However, both overall (8.82% vs 5.85%) and major complication rates (4.41% vs 2.17%) were comparable between the two groups. Importantly, urinary incontinence rate at 1-year after surgery was significantly higher in the CRP group (57.4% vs 90.8%, P < 0.0001). Univariate logistic analysis showed that the estimated blood loss was the only independent predictor of perioperative complications both in the unadjusted model (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.02-1.37; P = 0.025) and surgery type-adjusted model (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01-1.36; P = 0.034). In conclusion, CRP is more challenging than radical prostatectomy and associated with a notably higher incidence of urinary incontinence. Nevertheless, CRP is a technically feasible and safe surgery for selecting PCa patients who present with node-positive or bony metastasis when performed by experienced surgeons. A prospective, multi-institutional clinical trial is currently underway to verify this concept.""","""['Dae Keun Kim', 'Jaspreet Singh Parihar', 'Young Suk Kwon', 'Sinae Kim', 'Brian Shinder', 'Nara Lee', 'Nicholas Farber', 'Thomas Ahlering', 'Douglas Skarecky', 'Bertram Yuh', 'Nora Ruel', 'Wun-Jae Kim', 'Koon Ho Rha', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['A Multi-institutional Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes in 106 Men Who Underwent Radical Prostatectomy for Distant Metastatic Prostate Cancer at Presentation.', 'Comparison of Perioperative Outcomes Between Cytoreductive Radical Prostatectomy and Radical Prostatectomy for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Long-term oncological and continence outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single-centre experience.', 'Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy in metastatic prostate cancer: Does it really make sense?', 'Cytoreductive prostatectomy in metastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Influence of a continuous nursing model based on network cloud platforms for urinary control, urination function and quality of life of patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'Oncological Outcome of Combining Cytoreductive Prostatectomy and Metastasis-Directed Radiotherapy in Patients with Prostate Cancer and Bone Oligometastases: A Retrospective Cohort Study.', 'Results of Phase 1 study on cytoreductive radical prostatectomy in men with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Impact of tumor cytoreduction in metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Histomorphological alterations and the expression of ER stress sensors Atf6, Ire1α, Perk, their downstream effectors Grp78/BiP and eIF2α in ERG transgenic mouse prostate glands indicate the presence of chronic ER stress. Transient activation of apoptotic cell death during early age correlated well with the differential regulation of ER stress sensors, in particular Perk. Epithelial cells derived from ERG transgenic mouse prostates have increased prostasphere formation with resistance to radiation induced cell death. Continued activation of cell survival factors, Atf6 and Ire1α during chronic ER stress due to presence of ERG in prostate epithelium induces survival pathways and provides a selection pressure in the continuum of ERG dependent neoplastic process.

In this study, we compared localization results (mapping) based on 12-core prostate biopsy specimens from the six standard sites and six PZ outside these sites with results based on radical prostatectomy specimens. (Subjects and methods) Of the 208 patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at our hospital between January 2011 and July 2014, the 139 who had a 12-core biopsy before surgery were included in this study. Prostate needle biopsies were performed transrectally and the same pathologist evaluated preoperative biopsy specimens and resected pathology specimens. Patient age ranged from 52 to 77 years (median: 68 years). Prostate-specific antigen levels at the time of biopsy ranged from 3.1 to 84.7 ng/ml (median: 7.3 ng/ml) and the weight of excised tissue ranged from 17 to 90 g (median: 37 g). The surgical method was laparotomy in 63 cases, laparoscopy in 12 cases, and robot-assisted in 64 cases. The preoperative T classification was cT1c in 84 cases, cT2a in 29 cases, cT2b in 15 cases, and cT2c in 11 cases. The preoperative Gleason score was 3+3=6 in 36 cases, 3+4=7 in 48 cases, 4+3=7 in 33 cases, 4+4=8 in 9 cases, 4+5=9 in 11 cases, and 5+4=9 in 2 cases. The postoperative T classification was pT2a in 38 cases, pT2b in 12 cases, pT2c in 17 cases, pT2+in 20 cases, pT3a in 47 cases, and pT3b in 5 cases. The postoperative Gleason score was 3+3=6 in 19 cases, 3+4=7 in 60 cases, 4+3=7 in 39 cases, 4+4=8 in 1 case, 4+5=9 in 14 cases, 5+4=9 in 5 cases, and 5+5=10 in 1 case. (Results) The concordance rate for detection of cancer (localization) in the 12 sites of the preoperative biopsy and the same sites of resected specimens was 59.2% (median: 7.11/12). Furthermore, the Gleason score of the resected specimen was higher than the preoperative score for 79 patients (56.8%) and 63 of the 88 patients (71.6%) whose cancer was classified as unilateral on the basis of the preoperative biopsy were found to have cancer on the other side as well when the resected specimen was examined. (Conclusion) The results suggest that localization is not always consistent between positive biopsy sites and sites in resected specimens.

Past Canadian studies have not been able to thoroughly examine prostate cancer by occupation with detailed information on individual level factors.  Methods:   Occupation, industry and prostate cancer were examined using data from the National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance System, a large population-based case-control study conducted across eight Canadian provinces from 1994 to 1997. This analysis included 1737 incident cases and 1803 controls aged 50 to 79 years. Lifetime occupational histories were used to group individuals by occupation and industry employment. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and adjustments were made for known and possible risk factors.  Results:   By occupation, elevated risks were observed in farming and farm management (OR=1.37, 95% CI 1.02-1.84), armed forces (OR=1.33, 95% CI 1.06-1.65) and legal work (OR=2.58, 95% CI 1.05-6.35). Elevated risks were also observed in office work (OR=1.20, 95% CI 1.00-1.43) and plumbing (OR=1.77, 95% CI 1.07-2.93) and with ≥10 years duration of employment. Decreased risks were observed in senior management (OR=0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.91), construction management (OR=0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.94) and travel work (OR=0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.88). Industry results were similar to occupation results, except for an elevated risk in forestry/logging (OR=1.54, 95% CI 1.06-2.25) and a decreased risk in primary metal products (OR=0.70, 95% CI 0.51-0.96).

Enumeration of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in breast, colon and prostate cancer but is not in advanced GOA. Our study aims to establish the optimal threshold and the clinical significance of CTC count in advanced GOA before and during treatment.  Methods:   One hundred six patients with untreated advanced GOA were included in the ancillary study of the PRODIGE 17-ACCORD 20 trial. CTCs were detected in the peripheral blood using the CellSearch system on day 0 (D0) and day 28 (D28). The prognostic value of CTCs at D0 and D28 was analysed by testing several thresholds.  Results:   At baseline, median CTC count was 1 (range, 0-415). While CTCs ≥1, 2 or 3 at D0 were all significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), CTCs ≥2 were the optimal threshold, on D0 or D28. CTCs ≥2 at D28 were also predictive of disease control. Taking into account both D0 and D28 CTC count defined 3 groups (low/low, high/low and low-high/high) with significantly different PFS (p = 0.0002) and OS (p = 0.003).  Conclusion:   Quantification of CTCs at baseline and during treatment may be a useful prognostic tool in advanced GOA, as it is associated with worse PFS and OS.

The overexpression of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) has been correlated with chemotherapeutic drug resistance. However, the role of AXL expression in docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer is yet unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that AXL is overexpressed and activated independent of Gas6 in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells (PC3-DR and DU145-DR). Moreover, we show that forced overexpression of AXL in PC3 and DU145 cells is sufficient to induce resistance to docetaxel in these cell lines. Notably, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of AXL in the resistant models suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth, and these effects were significantly augmented when AXL inhibition was combined with docetaxel treatment. Mechanistically, we found that AXL inhibition led to reversion of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and decreased the expression of ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1). Overall, our results identify AXL as an important mediator of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer. We propose that AXL-targeted therapy, in combination with docetaxel, has the potential to improve the response to docetaxel therapy and reduce resistance induced by prolonged docetaxel therapy in prostate cancer.""","""['Jian-Zhong Lin', 'Zeng-Jun Wang', 'Wei De', 'Ming Zheng', 'Wei-Zhang Xu', 'Hong-Fei Wu', 'Alex Armstrong', 'Jia-Geng Zhu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Expression of AXL enhances docetaxel-resistance of prostate cancer cells.', 'Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is up-regulated in metformin resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Dual Inhibition of MEK and AXL Targets Tumor Cell Heterogeneity and Prevents Resistant Outgrowth Mediated by the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in NSCLC.', 'AXL receptor tyrosine kinase as a promising anti-cancer approach: functions, molecular mechanisms and clinical applications.', 'Molecular Pathways: AXL, a Membrane Receptor Mediator of Resistance to Therapy.', 'AXL Inhibitors: Status of Clinical Development.', 'A Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Sensitivity Prediction Model Identifies AXL Dependency in Leukemia.', 'Two-Front War on Cancer-Targeting TAM Receptors in Solid Tumour Therapy.', 'GAS6-AXL Inhibition by AVB-500 Overcomes Resistance to Paclitaxel in Endometrial Cancer by Decreasing Tumor Cell Glycolysis.', 'Research Progress of Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition Treatment and Drug Resistance in Colorectal Cancer.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated data on 198 consecutive chemotherapy-naïve patients who had received both abiraterone and enzalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer at Kyoto University Hospital (including satellite hospitals) and at Johns Hopkins Cancer Center. Prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated with sequential abiraterone-to-enzalutamide versus enzalutamide-to-abiraterone without intervening therapies were compared.  Results:   Overall, 113 patients were treated with the abiraterone-to-enzalutamide sequence and 85 with the enzalutamide-to-abiraterone sequence. Median prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival was not significantly different between abiraterone and enzalutamide in the first-line setting (hazard ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.66-1.19, P = 0.412), but there was an advantage favoring enzalutamide compared with abiraterone in the second-line setting (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.91, P = 0.009). Furthermore, the combined prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival was significantly longer in the abiraterone-to-enzalutamide sequence than in the enzalutamide-to-abiraterone sequence (hazard ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.76, P < 0.001). The difference was significant even in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.42-0.99, P = 0.044).

To compare radiobiological indices evaluated with different radiobiological models using MC and simulated AAPM TG-43 dose calculations.  Methods:   Three-dimensional dose distributions previously computed using MC techniques with two types of patient models, TG43sim (AAPM TG-43 water-based conditions) and MCDmm (realistic tissues and interseed effects), for 613 PIPB patients are coupled with biological dose and tumour control probability (TCP) models. Two approaches and their extensions are considered to evaluate biological doses, biologically effective dose (BED) and isoeffective dose (IED), as well as two methods to evaluate TCP. Three novel extensions of equivalent uniform biologically effective dose (EUBED) are suggested which consider the spatial distribution of doses within the target volume. Adopted radiobiological model parameter values (α, β, etc) are those suggested by AAPM TG-137, and sensitivity to parameter choice is discussed.  Results:   MCDmm dose calculations can reveal low doses in the prostate target volume, due to tissue heterogeneities or inter-seed effects; considering these low doses in EUBED calculations can lower TCP estimates by up to 70%, with largest differences in patients with calcifications. There are large variations in biological doses and TCPs evaluated over the 613 patient cohort for each radiobiological model considered, reflecting the spectrum of physical doses calculated for these patients with either MCDmm or TG43sim. Depending on the model details, BED, IED and EUBED are, on average, 6.0-9.8%, 7.4-9.2% and 1.8-15% higher, respectively, with TG43sim than MCDmm. TCP estimates computed using MCDmm dose distributions are much lower than expected based on past treatment outcome studies, suggesting a need to re-assess model parameters when evaluating radiobiological indices coupled with heterogeneous tissue model-based dose calculations.  Conclusions:   Cohort average differences in biological dose and TCP estimates between radiobiological models are generally larger than differences for any one radiobiological model evaluated with TG43sim or MCDmm dose calculations. However, heterogeneous tissue dose calculations, like MCDmm, can identify clinically-relevant low dose volumes, e.g., in patients with calcifications, which would otherwise be missed with TG-43. In addition to affecting physical dose distributions, these low dose volumes can largely impact radiobiological dose and TCP estimates, which further motivates the clinical implementation of model-based dose calculations for PIPB.""","""['Nelson Miksys', 'Mehan Haidari', 'Eric Vigneault', 'Andre-Guy Martin', 'Luc Beaulieu', 'Rowan M Thomson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric and radiobiological investigation of permanent implant prostate brachytherapy based on Monte Carlo calculations.', 'Large-scale Retrospective Monte Carlo Dosimetric Study for Permanent Implant Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'A detailed radiobiological and dosimetric analysis of biochemical outcomes in a case-control study of permanent prostate brachytherapy patients.', 'Monte Carlo role in radiobiological modelling of radiotherapy outcomes.', 'A review of dosimetric impact of implementation of model-based dose calculation algorithms (MBDCAs) for HDR brachytherapy.']"""

Qualitative findings highlighted physicians' concerns about malpractice lawsuits, given the possibility of disease progression. Additionally, most physicians noted the role of the healthcare setting, suggesting that financial incentives may be associated with AT recommendations in fee-for-service settings.

Moreover, we investigated the feasibility of adding dose tracking to the routine workflow for radiotherapy.  Methods:   Daily cone beam computed tomography was conducted for image-guided radiotherapy, and weekly cumulative delivered doses were calculated for dose tracking. Deformable image registration was applied to map weekly dose distributions to the original treatment plan and to create a cumulative dose distribution. The dose-volume histogram (DVH) cut-off points for the rectum and bladder and the planning target volume (PTV), were used to compare the planned and cumulative delivered doses. The additional time required by the departmental staff to complete these duties was recorded.  Results:   The PTV coverage of the delivered treatment did not satisfy the expected goal for three patients (V98% >98%). In another three patients, the DVH cut-off point for the bladder was higher than the limits, while for the rectum, treatment was as expected in all cases (two patients failed both their bladder constraints and the PTV coverage). Overall, four patients did not satisfy one or more criteria at the end of their treatment.

Murine double minute-2 (MDM2) is an oncoprotein that inhibits TP53 activity. A number of studies have examined the association of TP53 and MDM2 polymorphisms with the risk of common forms of cancer, but the findings remain inconclusive. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of the 40-bp insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism (rs3730485) in the MDM2 promoter region and the 16-bp I/D polymorphism (rs17878362) in TP53 on the susceptibility of prostate cancer (PCa) in a sample of the Iranian population. This case-control study included 103 patients with pathologically confirmed PCa and 142 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The MDM2 40-bp I/D and TP53 16-bp I/D polymorphism was determined using polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results demonstrated that the MDM2 40-bp I/D polymorphism increased the risk of PCa in a co-dominant inheritance model [odds ratio (OR)=1.88; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.11-3.19; P=0.023, D/D vs. I/I], while this variant marginally increased the risk of PCa in a dominant model (OR=1.69; 95% CI=1.00-2.83; P=0.051, I/D+D/D vs. I/I). No significant association was observed between the TP53 16-bp I/D polymorphism and PCa.

PUMA expression is modulated by the tumor suppressor p53. PUMA has a role in rapid cell death via p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. To evaluate whether p53 is required for PUMA-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, p53 protein was silenced in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells by using p53 small interfering RNA (siRNA). The interference efficiency of p53 on RNA and protein levels was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Cell proliferation and p21 expression were subsequently examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and western blot analysis, respectively. p53-silenced or control PC-3 cells were transfected with pCEP4-(hemagglutinin)-PUMA plasmid, or non-carrier plasmid. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine cell apoptosis by measuring histone release and caspase-3 activation, and MTT assay was used to measure cell viability. In addition, the expression of pro-apoptosis protein Bax and anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 were evaluated. The results of the present study revealed that p53 siRNA significantly suppressed p53 RNA and protein expression in PC-3 cells. Deficiency of p53 increased the cell growth rate and decreased p21 expression. However, PUMA overexpression remained able to induce apoptosis in p53-silenced and control cells by increasing Bax expression and decreasing Bcl-2 expression, leading to the activation of caspase-3. These results suggest that PUMA may mediate apoptosis of prostate cancer PC-3 cells, potentially independently of p53. Furthermore, PUMA gene treatment to induce cancer cell apoptosis may be more efficient compared with p53-dependent apoptosis, where loss of p53 expression or function may lead to limited efficacy of PUMA expression. Therefore, the present study proposes the significant hypothesis that increasing PUMA expression may be an effective approach for the treatment of prostate cancer, regardless of p53 status.""","""['Zhengfei Shan', 'Qingzuo Liu', 'Yuling Li', 'Jitao Wu', 'Dekang Sun', 'Zhenli Gao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['PUMA-mediated apoptosis in fibroblast-like synoviocytes does not require p53.', 'Exogenous p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) decreases growth of lung cancer A549 cells.', 'Estrogen receptor β upregulates FOXO3a and causes induction of apoptosis through PUMA in prostate cancer.', 'Combined loss of PUMA and p21 accelerates c-MYC-driven lymphoma development considerably less than loss of one allele of p53.', 'In vitro and in vivo inhibitory effect of Ad-ING4 gene on proliferation of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'The X box binding protein 1/C/EBP homologous protein pathway induces apoptosis of endothelial cells under hyperglycemia.', 'PATZ1 Induces Apoptosis through PUMA in Glioblastoma.', ""Cross-Talk between Amyloid, Tau Protein and Free Radicals in Post-Ischemic Brain Neurodegeneration in the Form of Alzheimer's Disease Proteinopathy."", 'Bioactivity of PEGylated Graphene Oxide Nanoparticles Combined with Near-Infrared Laser Irradiation Studied in Colorectal Carcinoma Cells.', 'Free Radical Damage in Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury: An Obstacle in Acute Ischemic Stroke after Revascularization Therapy.']"""

ING3 immunoreactivity was strongly detected in the stomach, skin and cervical tissues, whereas a weak signal was detected in the cerebellum, brain stem, thymus, liver, skeletal muscle, testis and prostate. In total, ING3-positive specimens were identified in 424 of 1,194 tested cancer entities (35.5%). In a number of cases, ING3 expression was observed to be restricted to the cytoplasm and nucleus, excluding the cytoplasmic distribution identified in breast and hepatocellular carcinoma. Among these cases, ING3 was more frequently expressed in breast and gynecological types of cancer, including ovarian (59.2%), endometrial (47.9%), breast (38.9%) and cervical (35.5%) cancer. ING3-positive cases were more rare in renal clear cell (17.7%), hepatocellular (16.1%) and esophageal carcinoma (17.8%).

The association between the expression levels of IRE1α, IRE1β and MUC2 and the clinicopathological features of patients with CRC was subsequently analyzed. The mRNA expression levels of IRE1β and MUC2 were decreased by ~2.1 and ~4.5-fold in CRC tissues, respectively, as compared with the adjacent normal tissues. The protein expression levels of IRE1β and MUC2 were decreased by ~8.0 and ~2.0-fold in the CRC tissues, respectively.

A biomechanical model-based algorithm initially developed in-house at an academic institution was translated into a commercial radiotherapy treatment planning system and validated for multiple imaging modalities and anatomic sites.  Methods:   Biomechanical deformable registration (Morfeus) is a geometry-driven algorithm based on the finite element method. Boundary conditions are derived from the model-based segmentation of controlling structures in each image which establishes a point-to-point surface correspondence. For each controlling structure, material properties and fixed or sliding interfaces are assigned. The displacements of internal volumes for controlling structures and other structures implicitly deformed are solved with finite element analysis. Registration was performed for 74 patients with images (mean vector resolution) of thoracic and abdominal 4DCT (2.8 mm) and MR (5.3 mm), liver CT-MR (4.5 mm), and prostate MR (2.6 mm). Accuracy was quantified between deformed and actual target images using distance-to-agreement (DTA) for structure surfaces and the target registration error (TRE) for internal point landmarks.  Results:   The results of the commercial implementation were as follows. The mean DTA was ≤ 1.0 mm for controlling structures and 1.0-3.5 mm for implicitly deformed structures on average. TRE ranged from 2.0 mm on prostate MR to 5.1 mm on lung MR on average, within 0.1 mm or lower than the image voxel sizes. Accuracy was not overly sensitive to changes in the material properties or variability in structure segmentations, as changing these inputs affected DTA and TRE by ≤ 0.8 mm. Maximum DTA > 5 mm occurred for 88% of the structures evaluated although these were within the inherent segmentation uncertainty for 82% of structures. Differences in accuracy between the commercial and in-house research implementations were ≤ 0.5 mm for mean DTA and ≤ 0.7 mm for mean TRE.  Conclusions:   Accuracy of biomechanical deformable registration evaluated on a large cohort of images in the thorax, abdomen and prostate was similar to the image voxel resolution on average across multiple modalities. Validation of this treatment planning system implementation supports biomechanical deformable registration as a versatile clinical tool to enable accurate target delineation at planning and treatment adaptation.""","""['Michael Velec', 'Joanne L Moseley', 'Stina Svensson', 'Björn Hårdemark', 'David A Jaffray', 'Kristy K Brock']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Biomechanical deformable image registration of longitudinal lung CT images using vessel information.', 'The evaluation of a hybrid biomechanical deformable registration method on a multistage physical phantom with reproducible deformation.', 'Utility and validation of biomechanical deformable image registration in low-contrast images.', 'Deformable registration for image-guided radiation therapy.', 'A review of biomechanically informed breast image registration.', 'Contrast-Enhanced Liver Magnetic Resonance Image Synthesis Using Gradient Regularized Multi-Modal Multi-Discrimination Sparse Attention Fusion GAN.', 'Ablative Margins of Colorectal Liver Metastases Using Deformable CT Image Registration and Autosegmentation.', 'Leveraging deep learning-based segmentation and contours-driven deformable registration for dose accumulation in abdominal structures.', 'Accuracy and consistency of intensity-based deformable image registration in 4DCT for tumor motion estimation in liver radiotherapy planning.', 'Automatic liver tumor localization using deep learning-based liver boundary motion estimation and biomechanical modeling (DL-Bio).']"""

Radium-223 patients with tALP decline from baseline to week 12 (confirmed ≥3 weeks from week 12) had 55% lower risk of death (hazard ratio = 0.45; 95% CI 0.34-0.61) versus those with no confirmed tALP decline. Proportional treatment effect (PTE) values for tALP, LDH, and PSA changes from baseline at week 12 as OS surrogate markers were 0.34 (95% CI: 0-0.746), 0.07 (95% CI: 0-0.211), and 0 (95% CI: 0-0.082), respectively.  Conclusions:   Significant tALP declines (versus placebo) occurred as early as 4 weeks after beginning radium-223 therapy. tALP or LDH declines at 12 weeks correlated with longer OS, but did not meet statistical surrogacy requirements. Dynamic changes in tALP and LDH during radium-223 treatments may be useful to monitor, but do not serve as surrogates for survival.""","""['O Sartor', 'R E Coleman', 'S Nilsson', 'D Heinrich', 'S I Helle', ""J M O'Sullivan"", 'N J Vogelzang', 'Ø Bruland', 'S Kobina', 'S Wilhelm', 'L Xu', 'M Shan', 'M W Kattan', 'C Parker']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['Overall survival in mCPRC patients treated with Radium-223 in association with bone health agents: a national multicenter study.', 'Phase II study of radium-223 dichloride in Japanese patients with symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Re-treatment with radium-223: 2-year follow-up from an international, open-label, phase 1/2 study in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.', 'Optimal usage of radium-223 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Patient Selection for Radium-223 Therapy in Patients With Bone Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: New Recommendations and Future Perspectives.', 'Impact of timing of radium‑223 administration on the survival of patients with bone metastatic castration‑resistant prostate cancer.', 'A phase II randomized trial of metastasis-directed therapy with alpha emitter radium-223 in men with oligometastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (MEDAL).', 'Optimization of Radium-223 Treatment of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Based on the Burden of Skeletal Metastasis and Clinical Parameters.', 'Clinical significance of completion of radium-223 treatment and acute adverse events in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'AlphaBet: Combination of Radium-223 and 17 7LuLu-PSMA-I&T in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (clinical trial protocol).']"""

We evaluated whether Black men of potentially screening-eligible age (55-69 years) are at a disproportionally high risk of poor outcomes.  Patients and methods:   The SEER database was used to study 390 259 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States between 2004 and 2011. Multivariable logistic regression modeled the association between Black race and stage of presentation, while Fine-Gray competing risks regression modeled the association between Black race and PCSM, both as a function of screening eligibility (age 55-69 years versus not).  Results:   Black men were more likely to present with metastatic disease (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.65; 1.58-1.72; P < 0.001) and were at a higher risk of PCSM (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.36; 1.27-1.46; P < 0.001) compared to non-Black men. There were significant interactions between race and PSA-screening eligibility such that Black patients experienced more disproportionate rates of metastatic disease (AOR 1.76; 1.65-1.87 versus 1.55; 1.47-1.65; Pinteraction < 0.001) and PCSM (AHR 1.53; 1.37-1.70 versus 1.25; 1.14-1.37; Pinteraction = 0.01) in the potentially PSA-screening eligible group than in the group not eligible for screening.  Conclusions:   Racial disparities in prostate cancer outcome among Black men are significantly worse in PSA-screening eligible populations. These results raise the possibility that Black men could be disproportionately impacted by recommendations to end PSA screening in the United States and suggest that Black race should be included in the updated USPSTF PSA screening guidelines.""","""['B A Mahal', 'Y-W Chen', 'V Muralidhar', 'A R Mahal', 'T K Choueiri', 'K E Hoffman', 'J C Hu', 'C J Sweeney', 'J B Yu', 'F Y Feng', 'S P Kim', 'C J Beard', 'N E Martin', 'Q-D Trinh', 'P L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['Association of very low prostate-specific antigen levels with increased cancer-specific death in men with high-grade prostate cancer.', 'Association of the USPSTF Grade D Recommendation Against Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening With Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', ""Abrogation of survival disparity between Black and White individuals after the USPSTF's 2012 prostate-specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening recommendation."", 'African-American Prostate Cancer Disparities.', 'Social ecological predictors of prostate-specific antigen blood test and digital rectal examination in black American men.', 'Review of Active Surveillance in Underrepresented and High-Risk Populations: Feasibility and Safety.', 'Dépistage du cancer de la prostate chez les hommes noirs au Canada : Argument en faveur des soins stratifiés en fonction du risque.', 'Prostate cancer screening in Black men in Canada: a case for risk-stratified care.', 'Psychosocial Stress, Glucocorticoid Signaling, and Prostate Cancer Health Disparities in African American Men.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Outcomes in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.']"""

Materials and Methods Six patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent robotic prostatectomy with whole-mount preservation of the prostate were identified, which enabled spatial mapping between preoperative multiparametric MR imaging and the gland. Four regions of interest were identified within each gland, including regions found to be normal and abnormal via histopathologic analysis. Whole-exome DNA sequencing (>50 times coverage) was performed on each of these spatially targeted regions. Radiogenomic analysis of imaging and mutation data were performed with hierarchical clustering, phylogenetic analysis, and principal component analysis. Results Radiogenomic multiparametric MR imaging and whole-exome spatial characterization in six patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (three patients, Gleason score of 3 + 4; and three patients, Gleason score of 4 + 5) was performed across 23 spatially distinct regions. Hierarchical clustering separated histopathologic analysis-proven high-grade lesions from the normal regions, and this reflected concordance between multiparametric MR imaging and resultant histopathologic analysis in all patients. Seventy-seven mutations involving 29 cancer-associated genes across the 23 spatially distinct prostate samples were identified. There was no significant difference in mutation load in cancer-associated genes between regions that were proven to be normal via histopathologic analysis (34 mutations per sample ± 19), mildly suspicious via multiparametric MR imaging (37 mutations per sample ± 21), intermediately suspicious via multiparametric MR imaging (31 mutations per sample ± 15), and high-grade cancer (33 mutations per sample ± 18) (P = .30). Principal component analysis resolved samples from different patients and further classified samples (regardless of histopathologic status) from prostate glands with Gleason score 3 + 4 versus 4 + 5 samples. Conclusion Multiregion spatial multiparametric MR imaging and whole-exome radiogenomic analysis of prostate glands with adenocarcinoma shows a continuum of mutations across regions that were found via histologic analysis to be high grade and normal. © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.""","""['Neema Jamshidi', 'Daniel J Margolis', 'Steven Raman', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Michael D Kuo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Radiology""","""['Is the Genetic Paradigm of Cancer Complete?', 'Characteristics of Detected and Missed Prostate Cancer Foci on 3-T Multiparametric MRI Using an Endorectal Coil Correlated With Whole-Mount Thin-Section Histopathology.', 'Detection of Prostate Cancer: Quantitative Multiparametric MR Imaging Models Developed Using Registered Correlative Histopathology.', 'Prostate Cancer: A Correlative Study of Multiparametric MR Imaging and Digital Histopathology.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Future Perspectives in Multiparametric Prostate MR Imaging.', 'Systemic Alterations of Cancer Cells and Their Boost by Polyploidization: Unicellular Attractor (UCA) Model.', 'Construction of a radiogenomic association map of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Paradoxical Behavior of Oncogenes Undermines the Somatic Mutation Theory.', 'Role of Image-Guided Percutaneous Needle Biopsy in the Age of Precision Medicine.', 'Personalized management of prostate cancer: from molecular and imaging markers to radiogenomics.']"""

Prostate cancer prevalence is rising in HIV-infected men due to improved survival on antiretroviral therapies, yet little is known about racial differences in prostate cancer risk by HIV-infection status and age.  Methods:   This is a prospective cohort study of prostate cancer risk in 2,800 HIV-infected and -uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM) aged 40-70 years (22% African American) who were enrolled in the multicenter AIDS cohort study from 1996 to 2010. Poisson regression models were used to examine associations between race and HIV-infection status and prostate cancer risk among men aged 40-70, 40-55, and 56-70 years.  Results:   Among men aged 40-70 years, incidence rates (IR) per 100,000 person-years were 169 among all men and 276 among African American HIV-infected men. Prostate cancer risk was similar by HIV-infection status (IRR 1.0, 95% CI 0.55-1.82), but nearly threefold higher in African Americans compared to non-African Americans in adjusted models (IRRs 2.66 and 3.22, 95% CIs 1.36-5.18 and 1.27-8.16 for all or HIV-infected men, respectively). Racial disparity in prostate cancer risk was greatest in African American men aged 40-55 years (adjusted IRR 3.31, 95% CI 1.19-9.22). Prostate cancer risk showed associations with family history of prostate cancer (p = 0.001), but not heavy smoking, androgen supplement use, or HIV-related factors.

Materials/methods:   Retrospective analysis of men whom underwent prostate multiparametric MRI and subsequent MR/US fusion biopsies at a single non-academic center from 11/2014 to 3/2016. Prostate MRIs were performed on a 3-Tesla scanner with a surface body coil. The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2 scoring algorithm was utilized and MR/US fusion biopsies were performed in selected cases. Mixed effect logistic regression analyses and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed on PI-RADS v2 alone and combined with PSA density (PSAD) to predict CS-PCa.  Results:   170 patients underwent prostate MRI with 282 PI-RADS lesions. MR/US fusion diagnosed 71 CS-PCa, 33 Gleason score 3+3, and 168 negative. PI-RADS v2 score is a statistically significant predictor of CS-PCa (P < 0.001). For each one-point increase in the overall PI-RADS v2 score, the odds of having CS-PCa increases by 4.2 (95% CI 2.2-8.3). The area under the ROC curve for PI-RADS v2 is 0.69 (95% CI 0.63-0.76) and for PI-RADS v2 + PSAD is 0.76 (95% CI 0.69-0.82), statistically higher than PI-RADS v2 alone (P < 0.001). The rate of CS-PCa was about twice higher in men with high PSAD (≥0.15) compared to men with low PSAD (<0.15) when a PI-RADS 4 or 5 lesion was detected (P = 0.005).

From the eastern to western border of a time zone, social time is equal, whereas solar time is progressively delayed, producing increased discrepancies between individuals' social and biological circadian time. Accordingly, western time zone residents experience greater circadian disruption and may be at an increased risk of cancer.Methods: We examined associations between the position in a time zone and age-standardized county-level incidence rates for total cancers combined and 23 specific cancers by gender using the data of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (2000-2012), including four million cancer diagnoses in white residents of 607 counties in 11 U.S. states. Log-linear regression was conducted, adjusting for latitude, poverty, cigarette smoking, and state. Bonferroni-corrected P values were used as the significance criteria.Results: Risk increased from east to west within a time zone for total and for many specific cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (both genders) and cancers of the stomach, liver, prostate, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in men and cancers of the esophagus, colorectum, lung, breast, and corpus uteri in women.Conclusions: Risk increased from the east to the west in a time zone for total and many specific cancers, in accord with the circadian disruption hypothesis. Replications in analytic epidemiologic studies are warranted.Impact: Our findings suggest that circadian disruption may not be a rare phenomenon affecting only shift workers, but is widespread in the general population with broader implications for public health than generally appreciated.

For 68Ga-PSMA-11 tracers, late imaging at 180 min after injection instead of imaging at 45-60 min after injection improves the detection of prostate cancer lesions. For 18F-DCFPyL, improved detection rates have recently been reported in a small pilot study. In this study, we report the effects of PET/CT imaging at 120 min after injection of 18F-DCFPyL in comparison to images acquired at 60 min after injection in a larger clinical cohort of 66 consecutive patients with histopathologically proven prostate cancer. Methods: Images were acquired 60 and 120 min after injection of 18F-DCFPyL. We report the positive lesions specified for anatomic locations (prostate, seminal vesicles, local lymph nodes, distant lymph nodes, bone, and others) at both time points by visual analysis, the image quality at both time points, and a semiquantitative analysis of the tracer activity in both prostate cancer lesions as well as normal tissues at both time points. Results: Our data showed a significantly increasing uptake of 18F-DCFPyL between 60 and 120 min after injection in 203 lesions characteristic for prostate cancer (median, 10.78 vs. 12.86, P < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). By visual analysis, 38.5% of all patients showed more lesions using images at 120 min after injection than using images at 60 min after injection, and in 9.2% a change in TNM staging was found. All lesions seen on images 60 min after injection were also visible on images 120 min after injection. A significantly better mean signal-to-noise ratio of 11.93 was found for images acquired 120 min after injection (P < 0.001, paired t test; signal-to-noise ratio at 60 min after injection, 11.15). Conclusion:18F-DCFPyL PET/CT images at 120 min after injection yield a higher detection rate of prostate cancer characteristic lesions than images at 60 min after injection.

A small number of ligands have been evaluated in patients, and although early tumor response is encouraging, relapse rate is high and these compounds localize to the parotid, salivary, and lacrimal glands as well as to the kidney, leading to dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events affecting quality of life. We envision that dual-target binding ligands displaying high affinity for PSMA and appropriate affinity for human serum albumin (HSA) may demonstrate a higher therapeutic index and be suitable for treatment of PCa by targeted α-therapy. Methods: Six novel urea-based ligands with varying affinities for PSMA and HSA were synthesized, labeled with 131I, and evaluated by in vitro binding and uptake assays in LNCaP cells. Four compounds were advanced for further evaluation in a preclinical model of PCa. The compounds were compared with MIP-1095, a PSMA ligand currently in clinical evaluation. Results: The compounds demonstrated affinity for PSMA on the order of 4-40 nM and affinity for HSA in the range of 1-53 μM. Compounds with relatively high affinity for HSA (≤2 μM) showed high and sustained blood-pool activity and reduced uptake in the kidneys. 131I-RPS-027, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (PSMA) of 15 nM and a dissociation constant (HSA) of 11.2 μM, cleared from the blood over the course of 48 h and showed good tumor uptake (10 percentage injected dose per gram) and retention and a greater than 5-fold decrease in kidney uptake relative to MIP-1095. The tumor-to-kidney ratio of 131I-RPS-027 was greater than 3:1 at 24 h after injection, increasing to 7:1 by 72 h. Conclusion: RPS-027 shows dual targeting to PSMA and albumin, resulting in a high tumor uptake, highly favorable tissue distribution, and promising therapeutic profile in a preclinical model of prostate cancer. In comparison to existing ligands proposed for targeted therapy of prostate cancer, RPS-027 has tumor-to-tissue ratios that predict a significant reduction in side effects during therapy. Using iodine/radioiodine as a surrogate for the radiohalogen 211At, we therefore propose dual-target binding ligands such as RPS-027 as next-generation radiopharmaceuticals for targeted α-therapy using 211At.""","""['James M Kelly', 'Alejandro Amor-Coarasa', 'Anastasia Nikolopoulou', 'Till Wüstemann', 'Peter Barelli', 'Dohyun Kim', 'Clarence Williams Jr', 'Xiwei Zheng', 'Cong Bi', 'Bao Hu', 'J David Warren', 'David S Hage', 'Stephen G DiMagno', 'John W Babich']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Implications for Expanding the Therapeutic Window.', 'Trifunctional PSMA-targeting constructs for prostate cancer with unprecedented localization to LNCaP tumors.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a Tailor-Made DOTA-Conjugated PSMA Inhibitor with Optimized Linker Moiety for Imaging and Endoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Rise of PSMA Ligands for Diagnosis and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy in prostate cancer.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 theranostic probe for hepatocellular carcinoma imaging and therapy.', '99mTcTc-PSMA-T4-Novel SPECT Tracer for Metastatic PCa: From Bench to Clinic.', 'Albumin-Mediated Size Exclusion Chromatography: The Apparent Molecular Weight of PSMA Radioligands as Novel Parameter to Estimate Their Blood Clearance Kinetics.', 'Preclinical investigations using 177LuLu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA toward its clinical translation for radioligand therapy of prostate cancer.', 'An Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligand with Higher Tumor Accumulation for PET Imaging of Prostate Cancer.']"""

In ovarian or breast cancers, olaparib resistance has been associated with HRR restoration, including by BRCA2 mutation reversion. Whether similar mechanisms operate in prostate cancer, and could be detected in liquid biopsies, is unclear.

The purpose of this work was to determine the ability of the COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib to modulate the EGFR-AR signaling pathway in androgen-dependent PCa cells and to provide a rationale for its beneficial use in chemopreventive strategies. Functional studies of Celecoxib activity were performed on LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Western blotting, gene expression analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay and ELISA were applied to assess the Celecoxib mechanisms of action. We found that Celecoxib, through EGF and amphiregulin (AREG) induction, caused EGFR and ErbB2 activation and consequent degradation associated with the inhibition of androgenic signaling. By upregulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1, Celecoxib also efficiently downregulated ErbB3, which is strongly implicated in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Lastly, Celecoxib directly regulated AR transcription and translation independent of ErbB activation by downregulating the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K). The simultaneous suppression of ErbB kinases and androgen signaling by Celecoxib represents a novel strategy to interrupt the vicious cycle of AR/ErbB cross-talk with the primary purpose of undermining their resilient signaling in prostate cancer progression.

Methods:   A survey was conducted using the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and additional questions exploring work/lifestyle factors. Statistical analyses were carried out to identify factors associated with burnout.  Results:   Total of 737 surveys (all ages) were collected from 41 European countries. Countries were divided into six regions. Results from 595 (81%) YOs were included (81% medical oncologists; 52% trainees, 62% women). Seventy-one percent of YOs showed evidence of burnout (burnout subdomains: depersonalization 50%; emotional exhaustion 45; low accomplishment 35%). Twenty-two percent requested support for burnout during training and 74% reported no hospital access to support services. Burnout rates were significantly different across Europe (P < 0.0001). Burnout was highest in central European (84%) and lowest in Northern Europe (52%). Depersonalization scores were higher in men compared with women (60% versus 45% P = 0.0001) and low accomplishment was highest in the 26-30 age group (P < 0.01). In multivariable linear regression analyses, European region, work/life balance, access to support services, living alone and inadequate vacation time remained independent burnout factors (P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   This is the largest burnout survey in European Young Oncologists. Burnout is common amongst YOs and rates vary across Europe.

SPOP (Speckle-type POZ Protein) was one of the most frequently mutated genes in primary prostate cancer, suggesting SPOP is a potential driver of prostate cancer development and progression. However, how SPOP mutations contribute to prostate cancer pathogenesis remains poorly understood. SPOP acts as an adaptor protein of the CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that generally recruits substrates for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. ER-localized isoform of the formin protein inverted formin 2 (INF2) mediates actin polymerization at ER-mitochondria intersections and facilitates DRP1 recruitment to mitochondria, which is a critical step in mitochondrial fission. Here, we revealed that SPOP recognizes a Ser/Thr (S/T)-rich motif in the C-terminal region of INF2 and triggers atypical polyubiquitination of INF2. These ubiquitination modifications do not lead to INF2 instability, but rather reduces INF2 localization in ER and mitochondrially associated DRP1 puncta formation, therefore abrogates its ability to facilitate mitochondrial fission. INF2 mutant escaping from SPOP-mediated ubiquitination is more potent in prompting mitochondrial fission. Moreover, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants increase INF2 localization in ER and promote mitochondrial fission, probably through a dominant-negative effect to inhibit endogenous SPOP. Moreover, INF2 is important for SPOP inactivation-induced prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. These findings reveal novel molecular events underlying the regulation of INF2 function and localization, and provided insights in understanding the relationship between SPOP mutations and dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics in prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaofeng Jin', 'Jie Wang', 'Kun Gao', 'Pingzhao Zhang', 'Longfang Yao', 'Yan Tang', 'Lisha Tang', 'Jian Ma', 'Jiantao Xiao', 'Enceng Zhang', 'Jie Zhu', 'Bin Zhang', 'Shi-Min Zhao', 'Yao Li', 'Shancheng Ren', 'Haojie Huang', 'Long Yu', 'Chenji Wang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['Destruction of DDIT3/CHOP protein by wild-type SPOP but not prostate cancer-associated mutants.', 'SPOP promotes ATF2 ubiquitination and degradation to suppress prostate cancer progression.', 'Endometrial cancer-associated mutants of SPOP are defective in regulating estrogen receptor-α protein turnover.', 'The ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP in cancer.', 'The emerging role of speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) in cancer development.', 'FBXO7, a tumor suppressor in endometrial carcinoma, suppresses INF2-associated mitochondrial division.', 'SPOP inhibits BRAF-dependent tumorigenesis through promoting non-degradative ubiquitination of BRAF.', 'SPOP mutations promote tumor immune escape in endometrial cancer via the IRF1-PD-L1 axis.', 'SPOP in Cancer: Phenomena, Mechanisms and Its Role in Therapeutic Implications.', 'DDX17 modulates the expression and alternative splicing of genes involved in apoptosis and proliferation in lung adenocarcinoma cells.']"""

Common genetic variants modify cancer risks for female carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations. We investigated-for the first time to our knowledge-associations of common genetic variants with breast and prostate cancer risks for male carriers of BRCA1/ 2 mutations and implications for cancer risk prediction. Materials and Methods We genotyped 1,802 male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 by using the custom Illumina OncoArray. We investigated the combined effects of established breast and prostate cancer susceptibility variants on cancer risks for male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations by constructing weighted polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using published effect estimates as weights. Results In male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations, PRS that was based on 88 female breast cancer susceptibility variants was associated with breast cancer risk (odds ratio per standard deviation of PRS, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.19 to 1.56; P = 8.6 × 10-6). Similarly, PRS that was based on 103 prostate cancer susceptibility variants was associated with prostate cancer risk (odds ratio per SD of PRS, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.81; P = 3.2 × 10-9). Large differences in absolute cancer risks were observed at the extremes of the PRS distribution. For example, prostate cancer risk by age 80 years at the 5th and 95th percentiles of the PRS varies from 7% to 26% for carriers of BRCA1 mutations and from 19% to 61% for carriers of BRCA2 mutations, respectively.

Manual trial-and-error determination of weighting factors has long been recognized as a time-consuming part of treatment planning. The purpose of this work is to develop an inverse planning framework that parameterizes the dosimetric tradeoff among the structures with physically meaningful quantities to simplify the search for clinically sensible plans. In this formalism, instead of using weighting factors, the permissible variation range of the prescription dose or dose volume histogram (DVH) of the involved structures are used to characterize the 'importance' of the structures. The inverse planning is then formulated into a convex feasibility problem, called the dosimetric variation-controlled model (DVCM), whose goal is to generate plans with dosimetric or DVH variations of the structures consistent with the pre-specified values. For simplicity, the dosimetric variation range for a structure is extracted from a library of previous cases which possess similar anatomy and prescription. A two-phase procedure (TPP) is designed to solve the model. The first phase identifies a physically feasible plan to satisfy the prescribed dosimetric variation, and the second phase automatically improves the plan in case there is room for further improvement. The proposed technique is applied to plan two prostate cases and two head-and-neck cases and the results are compared with those obtained using a conventional CVaR approach and with a moment-based optimization scheme. Our results show that the strategy is able to generate clinically sensible plans with little trial and error. In all cases, the TPP generates a very competitive plan as compared to those obtained using the alternative approaches. Particularly, in the planning of one of the head-and-neck cases, the TPP leads to a non-trivial improvement in the resultant dose distribution-the fractional volumes receiving a dose above 20 Gy for the spinal cord are reduced by more than 40% when compared to the alternative schemes, while maintaining the same PTV coverage. With physically more meaningful modeling of the inter-structural tradeoff, the reported technique enables us to substantially reduce the need for trial-and-error adjustment of the model parameters. The new formalism also opens new opportunities for incorporating prior knowledge to facilitate the treatment planning process.""","""['Hongcheng Liu', 'Peng Dong', 'Lei Xing']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Isodose feature-preserving voxelization (IFPV) for radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Clinical knowledge-based inverse treatment planning.', 'Dose-shaping using targeted sparse optimization.', 'Coverage optimized planning: probabilistic treatment planning based on dose coverage histogram criteria.', 'Treatment plan comparison between helical tomotherapy and MLC-based IMRT using radiobiological measures.', 'Isodose feature-preserving voxelization (IFPV) for radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Optimization of treatment planning workflow and tumor coverage during daily adaptive magnetic resonance image guided radiation therapy (MR-IGRT) of pancreatic cancer.']"""

The objective was to examine this association through nationwide, population-based registry data. Methods We performed a nested case-control study in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden, which includes all 38,570 prostate cancer cases diagnosed from 2009 to 2012, and 192,838 age-matched men free of prostate cancer. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to examine associations between TRT and risk of prostate cancer (overall, favorable, and aggressive). Results Two hundred eighty-four patients with prostate cancer (1%) and 1,378 control cases (1%) filled prescriptions for TRT. In multivariable analysis, no association was found between TRT and overall prostate cancer risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.17). However, patients who received TRT had more favorable-risk prostate cancer (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.56) and a lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.67). The increase in favorable-risk prostate cancer was already observed within the first year of TRT (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.34), whereas the lower risk of aggressive disease was observed after > 1 year of TRT (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.61). After adjusting for previous biopsy findings as an indicator of diagnostic activity, TRT remained significantly associated with more favorable-risk prostate cancer and lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer. Conclusion The early increase in favorable-risk prostate cancer among patients who received TRT suggests a detection bias, whereas the decrease in risk of aggressive prostate cancer is a novel finding that warrants further investigation.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'Yasin Folkvaljon', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'Joseph Alukal', 'Mats Lambe', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Re: Testosterone Replacement Therapy and Risk of Favorable and Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'The effect of testosterone replacement therapy on prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Influence of demographic factors and biochemical characteristics on the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to testosterone replacement therapy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen changes and prostate cancer in hypogonadal men treated with testosterone replacement therapy.', 'Testosterone treatment is not associated with increased risk of prostate cancer or worsening of lower urinary tract symptoms: prostate health outcomes in the Registry of Hypogonadism in Men.', 'Testosterone replacement therapy and the risk of prostate cancer.

Consensus definitions for cachexia provide different options to measure muscle mass. This study describes the effect of different methods to determine muscle mass on the diagnosis of cancer cachexia. In addition, the association of cachexia with other features of cachexia, quality of life, and survival was explored.  Methods:   Prior to chemotherapy, cachexia was assessed by weight loss, body mass index, and muscle mass measurements, the latter by mid-upper arm muscle area (MUAMA), computed tomography (CT) scans, and bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA). In addition, appetite, inflammation, muscle strength, fatigue, quality of life, and survival were measured, and associations with cachexia were explored.  Results:   Included were 241 patients with advanced cancer of the lung (36%), colon/rectum (31%), prostate (18%), or breast (15%). Mean age was 64 ± 10 years; 54% was male. Prevalence of low muscle mass was as follows: 13% with MUAMA, 59% with CT, and 93% with BIA. In turn, the prevalence of cachexia was 37, 43, and 48%, whereby weight loss >5% was the most prominent component of being defined cachectic. Irrespective of type of muscle measurement, patients with cachexia presented more often with anorexia, inflammation, low muscle strength, and fatigue and had lower quality of life. Patients with cachexia had worse overall survival compared with patients without cachexia: HRs 2.00 (1.42-2.83) with MUAMA, 1.64 (1.15-2.34) with CT, and 1.50 (1.05-2.14) with BIA.  Conclusions:   Although the prevalence of low muscle mass in patients with cancer depended largely on the type of muscle measurement, this had little influence on the diagnosis of cancer cachexia (as the majority of patients was already defined cachectic based on weight loss). New studies are warranted to further elucidate the additional role of muscle measurements in the diagnosis of cachexia and the association with clinical outcomes.""","""['Susanne Blauwhoff-Buskermolen', 'Jacqueline A E Langius', 'Annemarie Becker', 'Henk M W Verheul', 'Marian A E de van der Schueren']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle""","""['Relevance of the new pre-cachexia and cachexia definitions for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Measurement of body mass by bioelectrical impedance analysis and computed tomography in cancer patients with malnutrition - a cross-sectional observational study.', 'Influence of additional criteria from a definition of cachexia on its prevalence--good or bad thing?', 'Effects of weight loss and sarcopenia on response to chemotherapy, quality of life, and survival.', 'Cancer cachexia: molecular mechanism and pharmacological management.', 'CT-based assessment of sarcopenia for differentiating wild-type from mutant-type gastrointestinal stromal tumor.', 'Low Muscle Mass and Radiodensity Associate with Impaired Pulmonary Function and Respiratory Complications in Patients with Esophageal Cancer.', 'Review of the endocrine organ-like tumor hypothesis of cancer cachexia in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Malnutrition management in oncology: An expert view on controversial issues and future perspectives.', 'Assessment of Cancer-Associated Cachexia - How to Approach Physical Function Evaluation.']"""

Less pronounced ADT effects are seen in metastases than in primary tumors. To test if acute effects of ADT was enhanced by concurrent inhibition of pro-survival insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), rats were inoculated with Dunning R3327-G tumor cells into the tibial bone marrow cavity and established tumors were treated with castration in combination with IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitor NVP-AEW541, or by each treatment alone. Dunning R3327-G cells were stimulated by androgens and IGF-1 in vitro. In rat tibia, Dunning R3327-G cells induced bone remodeling, identified through increased immunoreactivity of osteoblast and osteoclast markers. Tumor cells occasionally grew outside the tibia, and proliferation and apoptotic rates a few days after treatment were evaluated by scoring BrdU- and caspase-3-positive tumor cells inside and outside the bone marrow cavity, separately. Apoptosis was significantly induced outside, but unaffected inside, the tibial bone by either castration or NVP-AEW541, and the maximum increase (2.7-fold) was obtained by the combined treatment. Proliferation was significantly reduced by NVP-AEW541, independently of growth site, although the maximum decrease (24%) was observed when NVP-AEW541 was combined with castration. Tumor cell IGF-1R immunoreactivity was evaluated in clinical PCa bone metastases (n = 61), and positive staining was observed in most cases (74%). In conclusion, IGF-1R inhibition may be evaluated in combination with ADT in patients with metastatic PCa, or in combination with therapies for the subsequent development of castration-resistant disease, although diverse responses could be anticipated depending on metastasis site.""","""['Annika Nordstrand', 'Sofia Halin Bergström', 'Elin Thysell', 'Erik Bovinder-Ylitalo', 'Ulf H Lerner', 'Anders Widmark', 'Anders Bergh', 'Pernilla Wikström']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Kinase inhibitors of the IGF-1R as a potential therapeutic agent for rheumatoid arthritis.', 'The insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 is a promising target for novel treatment approaches in neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumours.', 'Co-Targeting IGF-1R and Autophagy Enhances the Effects of Cell Growth Suppression and Apoptosis Induced by the IGF-1R Inhibitor NVP-AEW541 in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Plasma and tissue insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer and anti-IGF-IR agents as novel therapeutic strategy for refractory cases: a review.', 'Apalutamide and its use in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Emerging Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Cancer: A Promising Biomarker and Therapeutic Target.', 'Connecting the Dots Between the Gut-IGF-1-Prostate Axis: A Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Carcinogenesis.', 'A Mini-Review of Flavone Isomers Apigenin and Genistein in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Inhibition of Janus Kinase 1 synergizes docetaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer cells.', 'Insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling in tumorigenesis and drug resistance: a challenge for cancer therapy.']"""

We calculated study-specific relative risks using Cox proportional hazards regression, and then pooled these estimates using a random effects model.Results: We did not observe any statistically significant associations for advanced prostate cancer or prostate cancer mortality with any food group (including total fruits and vegetables, total fruits, total vegetables, fruit and vegetable juice, cruciferous vegetables, and tomato products), nor specific fruit and vegetables. In addition, we observed few statistically significant results for other prostate cancer outcomes.

To better understand prostate tumor initiation, we sought to investigate specific genes and mechanisms required for normal basal to luminal cell differentiation. Utilizing human prostate basal epithelial cells and an in vitro differentiation model, we tested the hypothesis that regulation of NOTCH3 by the p38 MAPK family (hereafter p38-MAPK), via MYC, is required for luminal differentiation. Inhibition (SB202190 and BIRB796) or knockdown of p38α (also known as MAPK14) and/or p38δ (also known as MAPK13) prevented proper differentiation. Additionally, treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor (RO4929097) or knockdown of NOTCH1 and/or NOTCH3 greatly impaired differentiation and caused luminal cell death. Constitutive p38-MAPK activation through MKK6(CA) increased NOTCH3 (but not NOTCH1) mRNA and protein levels, which was diminished upon MYC inhibition (10058-F4 and JQ1) or knockdown. Furthermore, we validated two NOTCH3 enhancer elements through a combination of enhancer (e)RNA detection (BruUV-seq) and luciferase reporter assays. Finally, we found that the NOTCH3 mRNA half-life increased during differentiation or upon acute p38-MAPK activation. These results reveal a new connection between p38-MAPK, MYC and NOTCH signaling, demonstrate two mechanisms of NOTCH3 regulation and provide evidence for NOTCH3 involvement in prostate luminal cell differentiation.""","""['Sander B Frank', 'Penny L Berger', 'Mats Ljungman', 'Cindy K Miranti']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['p38 MAPK regulates the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 in osteotropic prostate cancer cells.', 'The p38 MAPK pathway mediates aryl propionic acid induced messenger rna stability of p75 NTR in prostate cancer cells.', 'G Protein-coupled Receptor 40 (GPR40) and Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor γ (PPARγ): AN INTEGRATED TWO-RECEPTOR SIGNALING PATHWAY.', 'Role of C/EBP-β, p38 MAPK, and MKK6 in IL-1β-mediated C3 gene regulation in astrocytes.', 'Escherichia coli-derived and Staphylococcus aureus-derived extracellular vesicles induce MUC5AC expression via extracellular signal related kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in human airway epithelial cells.', 'Lifelong exercise training promotes the remodelling of the immune system and prostate signalome in a rat model of prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Clinical significance of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases in hepatitis B virus -related hepatocellular carcinoma and underlying mechanism exploration.', 'Mapping genetic variability in mature miRNAs and miRNA binding sites in prostate cancer.', 'Aberrant CREB1 activation in prostate cancer disrupts normal prostate luminal cell differentiation.', 'The Metabolic Fates of Pyruvate in Normal and Neoplastic Cells.']"""

Here, we preanalytically, analytically, and clinically validated a robust IHC assay to detect subclonal and focal TP53 missense mutations in prostate cancer.Experimental Design: The p53 IHC assay was performed in a CLIA-accredited laboratory on the Ventana Benchmark immunostaining system. p53 protein nuclear accumulation was defined as any p53 nuclear labeling in >10% of tumor cells. Fifty-four formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell lines from the NCI-60 panel and 103 FFPE prostate cancer tissues (88 primary adenocarcinomas, 15 metastases) with known TP53 mutation status were studied. DU145 and VCaP xenografts were subjected to varying fixation conditions to investigate the effects of preanalytic variables. Clinical validation was performed in two partially overlapping radical prostatectomy cohorts.Results: p53 nuclear accumulation by IHC was 100% sensitive for detection of TP53 missense mutations in the NCI-60 panel (25/25 missense mutations correctly identified). Lack of p53 nuclear accumulation was 86% (25/29) specific for absence of TP53 missense mutation. In FFPE prostate tumors, the positive predictive value of p53 nuclear accumulation for underlying missense mutation was 84% (38/45), whereas the negative predictive value was 97% (56/58). In a cohort of men who experienced biochemical recurrence after RP, the multivariable HR for metastasis among cases with p53 nuclear accumulation compared with those without was 2.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.91).Conclusions: IHC is widely available method to assess for the presence of deleterious and heterogeneous TP53 missense mutations in clinical prostate cancer specimens.

While CMS performs in-house checks of these claims, little is known of their quality for conducting pharmacoepidemiologic research. We performed exploratory analyses of the quality of Medicaid and Medicare data obtained from CMS and its contractors.  Methods:   Our study population consisted of Medicaid beneficiaries (with and without dual coverage by Medicare) from California, Florida, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. We obtained and compiled 1999-2011 data from these state Medicaid programs (constituting about 38% of nationwide Medicaid enrollment), together with corresponding national Medicare data for dually-enrolled beneficiaries. This descriptive study examined longitudinal patterns in: dispensed prescriptions by state, by quarter; and inpatient hospitalizations by federal benefit, state, and age group. We further examined discrepancies between demographic characteristics and disease states, in particular frequencies of pregnancy complications among men and women beyond childbearing age, and prostate cancers among women.  Results:   Dispensed prescriptions generally increased steadily and consistently over time, suggesting that these claims may be complete. A commercially-available National Drug Code lookup database was able to identify the dispensed drug for 95.2-99.4% of these claims. Because of co-coverage by Medicare, Medicaid data appeared to miss a substantial number of hospitalizations among beneficiaries ≥ 45 years of age. Pregnancy complication diagnoses were rare in males and in females ≥ 60 years of age, and prostate cancer diagnoses were rare in females.  Conclusions:   CMS claims from five large states obtained directly from CMS and its contractors appeared to be of high quality.

The expression of fusion mRNAs from distinct T/E variants is associated with clinicopathological parameters, while the underlying molecular processes remain unclear. We characterized the molecular mechanisms and functional implications caused by doxycycline (Dox)-inducible overexpression of the frequent T/E III and VI fusion variants in LNCaP cells. Induction of T/E expression resulted in increased cellular migratory and invasive potential, and reduced proliferation and accumulation in G1 phase. T/E overexpressing cells showed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as demonstrated by upregulation of TGF-β and WNT pathway genes, mesenchymal markers, and increased phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK. Augmented secretion of TGF-β1 and -β2, and T/E-mediated regulation of ALK1, a member of the TGF-β receptor family, was detected. ALK1 inhibition in T/E overexpressing cells blocked p38 phosphorylation and reduced the expression of the TGF-β target genes VIM, MMP1, CDH2, and SNAI2. We found a T/E variant VI-specific induction of miR-503 associated with reduced expression of SMAD7 and CDH1. Overexpression of miR-503 led to increased levels of VIM and MMP1. Our findings indicate that TGF-β signaling is a major determinant of EMT in T/E overexpressing LNCaP cells. We provide evidence that T/E VI-specific transcriptional modulation by miR-503 accounts for differences in the activation of EMT pathway genes, promoting the aggressive phenotype of tumors expressing T/E variant VI. We suggest that ALK1-mediated TGF-β signaling is a novel oncogenic mechanism in T/E positive PCa.""","""['Leonie Ratz', 'Mark Laible', 'Lukasz A Kacprzyk', 'Stephanie M Wittig-Blaich', 'Yanis Tolstov', 'Stefan Duensing', 'Peter Altevogt', 'Sabine M Klauck', 'Holger Sültmann']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Expression of steroid and peptide hormone receptors, metabolic enzymes and EMT-related genes in prostate tumors in relation to the presence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion.', 'TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene expression alters chemo- and radio-responsiveness in cell culture models of androgen independent prostate cancer.', 'Significance of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in prostate cancer.', 'The Expression of Proto-Oncogene ETS-Related Gene (ERG) Plays a Central Role in the Oncogenic Mechanism Involved in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition: focusing on hypoxia and TGF-β signaling.', 'Past, Current, and Future Strategies to Target ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Exome sequencing identified six copy number variations as a prediction model for recurrence of primary prostate cancers with distinctive prognosis.', 'Infection by High-Risk Human Papillomaviruses, Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Squamous Pre-Malignant or Malignant Lesions of the Uterine Cervix: A Series of Chained Events?', 'Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling differentially regulate oncogenic ERG mediated transcription in prostate cells.', 'miR-449a Repression Leads to Enhanced NOTCH Signaling in TMPRSS2:ERG Fusion Positive Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

A functional Gly388Arg (rs351855 G>A) polymorphism in FGFR4 gene causes a glycine-to-arginine change at codon 388 within the transmembrane domain of the receptor. Although the FGFR4 rs351855 G>A polymorphism has been implicated in cancer development, its association with cancer risk remains controversial. Here, we have systematically analyzed the association between the rs351855 G>A polymorphism and cancer risk by performing a meta-analysis of 27 studies consisting of 8,682 cases and 9,731 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to measure the strength of the association. The rs351855 G>A polymorphism was associated with an increased cancer risk under the recessive model (OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.01-1.41). Stratified analysis by cancer type indicated the rs351855 G>A polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of breast and prostate cancer, but a decreased risk of lung cancer. This meta-analysis demonstrates the FGFR rs351855 G>A polymorphism is associated with increased cancer risk and suggests it could potentially serve as a chemotherapeutic target or biomarker to screen high-risk individuals.""","""['Si-Wei Xiong', 'Jianqun Ma', 'Fen Feng', 'Wen Fu', 'Shan-Rong Shu', 'Tianjiao Ma', 'Caixia Wu', 'Guo-Chang Liu', 'Jinhong Zhu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['An updated meta-analysis of the association between fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 polymorphisms and susceptibility to cancer.', 'FGFR4 transmembrane domain polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis including 8555 subjects.', 'Meta and pooled analyses of FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphism as a cancer prognostic factor.', 'Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 polymorphisms and susceptibility to coronary artery disease.', 'Polymorphisms of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 have association with the development of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia and the progression of prostate cancer in a Japanese population.', 'Proteogenomic links to human metabolic diseases.', 'A rare case of highly differentiated follicular carcinoma in ovary with FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphism: a case report and literature review.', 'FGFR4 Gly388Arg Polymorphism Reveals a Poor Prognosis, Especially in Asian Cancer Patients: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Effects of FGFR4 G388R, V10I polymorphisms on the likelihood of cancer.', 'An updated meta-analysis of the association between fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 polymorphisms and susceptibility to cancer.']"""

We describe a protein vector that selectively delivers synthetic dsRNA, polyinosinic/polycytidylic acid (polyIC), to prostate tumors by targeting prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is overexpressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells.The chimeric protein is built from the double stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain of PKR tethered to a single chain anti-PSMA antibody. When complexed with polyIC, the chimera demonstrates selective and efficient killing of prostate cancer cells. The treatment causes the targeted cancer cells to undergo apoptosis and to secrete toxic cytokines. In a ""bystander effect"", these cytokines kill neighboring cancer cells that do not necessarily overexpress PSMA, and activate immune cells that enhance the killing effect. The strong effects of the targeted polyIC are demonstrated on both 2D cell cultures and 3D tumor spheroids.""","""['Yael Langut', 'Nufar Edinger', 'Efrat Flashner-Abramson', 'Naomi Melamed-Book', 'Mario Lebendiker', 'Yael Levi-Kalisman', 'Shoshana Klein', 'Alexander Levitzki']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['PSMA-targeted polyinosine/polycytosine vector induces prostate tumor regression and invokes an antitumor immune response in mice.', 'Antitumor Activity of MEDI3726 (ADCT-401), a Pyrrolobenzodiazepine Antibody-Drug Conjugate Targeting PSMA, in Preclinical Models of Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA specific single chain antibody-mediated targeted knockdown of Notch1 inhibits human prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth.', 'Dendritic cell based PSMA immunotherapy for prostate cancer using a CD40-targeted adenovirus vector.', 'Radiolabeled enzyme inhibitors and binding agents targeting PSMA: Effective theranostic tools for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Protein purification strategies must consider downstream applications and individual biological characteristics.', 'My journey from tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitors to targeted immune therapy as strategies to combat cancer.', 'Nanoparticle Delivery of RIG-I Agonist Enables Effective and Safe Adjuvant Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Bispecific protein targets prostate cancer.']"""
