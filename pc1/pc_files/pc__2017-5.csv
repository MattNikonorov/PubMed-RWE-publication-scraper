One key feature is the involvement of chromosomal rearrangements creating fusion genes. Recent RNA-sequencing technology has uncovered that fusions which are not caused by chromosomal rearrangements, but rather meditated at transcription level, are common in both healthy and diseased cells. Such fusion transcripts have been proven highly associated with prostate cancer development and progression. To discover novel fusion transcripts, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from 44 primary prostate tumors and matched benign tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Twenty-one high-confident candidates were significantly enriched in malignant vs. benign samples. Thirteen of the candidates have not previously been described in prostate cancer, and among them, five long intergenic non-coding RNAs are involved as fusion partners. Their expressions were validated in 50 additional prostate tumor samples and seven prostate cancer cell lines. For four fusion transcripts, we found a positive correlation between their expression and the expression of the 3' partner gene. Among these, differential exon usage and qRT-PCR analyses in particular support that SLC45A3-ELK4 is mediated by an RNA polymerase read-through mechanism.""","""['Sen Zhao', 'Marthe Løvf', 'Kristina Totland Carm', 'Anne Cathrine Bakken', 'Andreas M Hoff', 'Rolf I Skotheim']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['SLC45A3-ELK4 is a novel and frequent erythroblast transformation-specific fusion transcript in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen regulation of ETS gene fusion transcripts in prostate cancer.', 'Chimeric transcript generated by cis-splicing of adjacent genes regulates prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'Discovery and Classification of Fusion Transcripts in Prostate Cancer and Normal Prostate Tissue.', 'Signaling networks in TMPRSS2-ERG positive prostate cancers: Do we need a Pied Piper or sharpshooter to deal with ""at large"" fused oncoprotein.', 'Characterization and evaluation of gene fusions as a measure of genetic instability and disease prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Overview of research on fusion genes in prostate cancer.', 'Expression Analysis of Long Non-Coding RNAs Related With FOXM1, GATA3, FOXA1 and ESR1 in Breast Tissues.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis Reveals the Diverse Landscape of Novel Sense and Antisense Fusion Transcripts.', 'A New Era of Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.']"""

In other cancer types, altered APE1 protein expression is a candidate prognostic marker. Using immunohistochemistry, we thus analyzed APE1 expression in 9763 prostate cancers in a tissue microarray (TMA) with attached clinical and molecular data. The comparison with normal prostate tissue revealed an upregulation of APE1 in cancer samples. APE1 immunostaining was considered weak in 20.2%, moderate in 36.7%, and strong in 33.4% of cancers. Strong APE1 expression was markedly more frequent in prostate cancers harboring the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (52.9%) than in ERG-negative cancers (19.1%, P < 0.0001). Significant associations with Gleason grade, tumor stage, tumor grade, and early biochemical recurrence (P < 0.0001 each) were largely limited to ERG-negative tumors. Multivariable analysis revealed that the prognostic value of APE1 upregulation in ERG-negative prostate cancers was independent from established histopathological and clinical parameters.

A better understanding of the molecular basis of prostate cancer proliferation and metastasis should enable development of more effective treatments. In this study we focused on the lncRNA, prostate cancer associated transcript 29 (PCAT29), a putative tumor suppressive gene. Our data show that the expression of PCAT29 was reduced in prostate cancer tumors compared to paired perinormal prostate tissues. We also observed substantially lower levels of PCAT29 in DU145 and LNCaP cells compared to normal prostate (RWPE-1) cells. IL-6, a cytokine which is elevated in prostate tumors, reduced the expression of PCAT29 in both DU145 and LNCaP cells by activating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). One downstream target of STAT3 is microRNA (miR)-21, inhibition of which enhanced basal PCAT29 expression. In addition, we show that resveratrol is a potent stimulator of PCAT29 expression under basal condition and reversed the down regulation of this lncRNA by IL-6. Furthermore, we show that knock down of PCAT29 expression by siRNA in DU145 and LNCaP cells increased cell viability while increasing PCAT29 expression with resveratrol decreased cell viability. Immunohistochemistry studies showed increased levels of STAT3 and IL-6, but low levels of programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), in prostate tumor epithelial cells compared to adjacent perinormal prostate epithelial cells. These data show that the IL-6/STAT3/miR-21 pathway mediates tonic suppression of PCAT29 expression and function. Inhibition of this signaling pathway by resveratrol induces PCAT29 expression and tumor suppressor function.""","""['Raheem F H Al Aameri', 'Sandeep Sheth', 'Entkhab M A Alanisi', 'Vikrant Borse', 'Debashree Mukherjea', 'Leonard P Rybak', 'Vickram Ramkumar']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Sulforaphane inhibits constitutive and interleukin-6-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Resveratrol reduces prostate cancer growth and metastasis by inhibiting the Akt/MicroRNA-21 pathway.', 'Interleukin 6 activates androgen receptor-mediated gene expression through a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-dependent pathway in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Interleukin-6: a multifunctional targetable cytokine in human prostate cancer.', 'Interleukin-6 and prostate cancer: Current developments and unsolved questions.', 'An overview of natural products that modulate the expression of non-coding RNAs involved in oxidative stress and inflammation-associated disorders.', 'Contribution of Non-Coding RNAs to Anticancer Effects of Dietary Polyphenols: Chlorogenic Acid, Curcumin, Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate, Genistein, Quercetin and Resveratrol.', 'Disease-Associated Regulation of Non-Coding RNAs by Resveratrol: Molecular Insights and Therapeutic Applications.', 'Resveratrol in Intestinal Health and Disease: Focusing on Intestinal Barrier.', 'Long non-coding RNAs involved in different steps of cancer metastasis.']"""

An acid-catalyzed Fischer indolization is a central step in its synthesis. The reaction leads to only one of the two possible indole regioisomers, along with minor decomposition products. Computations show that the formation of the observed indole is most favored energetically, while the potential pathway to the minor isomer leads instead to decomposition products. The disfavored [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, which would produce the unobserved indole product, is destabilized by the electron-withdrawing phthalimide substituent. The most favored [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement transition state is bimodal, leading to two reaction intermediates from one transition state, which is confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations.

However, mechanism of TPD52 in prostate cancer initiation and progression remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the possible underlying mechanism of TPD52 in prostate cancer progression. In LNCaP cells, TPD52 expression was altered by transfecting with either EGFP-TPD52 or specific short hairpin RNA. Overexpression of TPD52 protected LNCaP cells from apoptosis through elevated anti-apoptotic proteins XIAP, Bcl-2, and Cyclin D1, whereas Bax was downregulated. Mechanistically, we found that TPD52 confers transactivation of nuclear factor-κB, thereby enhancing its target gene expression in LNCaP cells. TPD52 promotes LNCaP cell invasion probably via increased matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression and its activity while tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase expression is significantly downregulated. Notably, TPD52 might be involved in cell adhesion, promoting tumor metastasis by inducing loss of E-cadherin, expression of vimentin and vascular cell adhesion molecule, and additionally activation of focal adhesion kinase. Furthermore, TPD52 directly interacts with nuclear factor-κB p65 (RelA) and promotes accumulation of phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB (p65)S536 that is directly linked with nuclear factor-κB transactivation. Indeed, depletion of TPD52 or inhibition of nuclear factor-κB in TPD52-positive cells inhibited secretion of tumor-related cytokines and contributes to the activation of STAT3, nuclear factor-κB, and Akt. Interestingly, in TPD52 overexpressing LNCaP cells, nuclear factor-κB inhibition prevented the autocrine/paracrine activation of STAT3. TPD52 activates STAT3 through ascertaining a cross talk between the nuclear factor-κB and the STAT3 signaling systems. Collectively, these results reveal mechanism by which TPD52 is associated with prostate cancer progression and highlight the approach for therapeutic targeting of TPD52 in prostate cancer.""","""['Chandrashekhar Dasari', 'Dattu Prasad Yaghnam', 'Reinhard Walther', 'Ramesh Ummanni']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Altered expression of tumor protein D52 regulates apoptosis and migration of prostate cancer cells.', 'All-Trans-Retinoic Acid Stimulates Overexpression of Tumor Protein D52 (TPD52, Isoform 3) and Neuronal Differentiation of IMR-32 Cells.', 'Isoform 1 of TPD52 (PC-1) promotes neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Tumor protein D52 (TPD52) and cancer-oncogene understudy or understudied oncogene?', 'STAT3 signaling in prostate cancer progression and therapy resistance: An oncogenic pathway with diverse functions.', 'AMPK targets a proto-oncogene TPD52 (isoform 3) expression and its interaction with LKB1 suppress AMPK-GSK3β signaling axis in prostate cancer.', 'Predicting 3D Structure, Cross Talks, and Prognostic Significance of KLF9 in Cervical Cancer.', 'Exosomal Circ-XIAP Promotes Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer by Regulating miR-1182/TPD52 Axis.', 'Long-Noncoding RNA FGD5-AS1 Enhances the Viability, Migration, and Invasion of Glioblastoma Cells by Regulating the miR-103a-3p/TPD52 Axis.', 'Tumor protein D54 defines a new class of intracellular transport vesicles.']"""

Although the hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) gene has been observed to be epigenetically modified in PCa, its intrinsic role and mechanism in PCa metastasis still remain uncertain. Here, we show that hypermethylation of the HIC1 promoter markedly reduces its suppressive function in metastatic PCa tissues as compared with primary and adjacent normal prostate tissues, and is associated with poor patient survival. PCas in cancer-prone mice homozygous for a prostate-targeted Hic1 conditional knockout showed stronger metastatic behaviour than those in heterozygous mice, as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, impairment of HIC1 expression in PCa cells induced their migration and metastasis through EMT, by enhancing expression of Slug and CXCR4, both of which are critical to PCa metastasis; the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis promotes EMT by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway.

Less is known regarding comparisons of different IGRT techniques and the resulting residual errors, as well as regarding their influences on dose distributions.  Patients and methods:   A total of 58 patients who received tomotherapy-based RT up to 84 Gy for high-risk prostate cancer underwent IGRT based either on daily megavoltage CT (MVCT) alone (n = 43) or the additional use of gold markers (n = 15) under routine conditions. Planned Adaptive (Accuray Inc., Madison, WI, USA) software was used for elaborated offline analysis to quantify residual interfractional prostate positioning errors, along with systematic and random errors and the resulting safety margins after both IGRT approaches. Dosimetric parameters for clinical target volume (CTV) coverage and exposition of organs at risk (OAR) were also analyzed and compared. Interfractional as well as intrafractional displacements were determined.  Results:   Particularly in the vertical direction, residual interfractional positioning errors were reduced using the gold marker-based approach, but dosimetric differences were moderate and the clinical relevance relatively small. Intrafractional prostate motion proved to be quite high, with displacements of 1-3 mm; however, these did not result in additional dosimetric impairments.  Conclusion:   Residual interfractional positioning errors were reduced using gold marker-based IGRT; however, this resulted in only slightly different final dose distributions. Therefore, daily MVCT-based IGRT without markers might be a valid alternative.""","""['Peter Wust', 'Marc Joswig', 'Reinhold Graf', 'Dirk Böhmer', 'Marcus Beck', 'Thomasz Barelkowski', 'Volker Budach', 'Pirus Ghadjar']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy and the dosimetric impact of inter- and intrafractional motion on the planning target volume for prostate cancer patients.', 'Image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer: Analysis of interfractional errors and acute toxicity.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer; how, when and why?.', 'Assessment of intrafractional prostate motion and its dosimetric impact in MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy with gating.', 'Injection of hydrogel spacer increased maximal intrafractional prostate motion in anterior and superior directions during volumetric modulated arc therapy-stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric Impact of the Positional Imaging Frequency for Hypofractionated Prostate Radiotherapy - A Voxel-by-Voxel Analysis.', 'Impact of Inter-fractional Anatomical Changes on Dose Distributions in Passive Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Vertical and Horizontal Fields.', 'Image-guided dose-escalated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer with helical tomotherapy.']"""

However, stringent androgen deprivation therapy regimens decrease quality of life and have been largely unsuccessful in curtailing mortality. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have taken advantage of the dichotomous ability of AR signaling to elicit growth-suppressive and differentiating effects by administering hyperphysiologic levels of testosterone. In this study, high-throughput drug screening identified a potent synergy between high-androgen therapy and YM155, a transcriptional inhibitor of survivin (BIRC5). This interaction was mediated by the direct transcriptional upregulation of the YM155 transporter SLC35F2 by the AR. Androgen-mediated YM155-induced cell death was completely blocked by the overexpression of multidrug resistance transporter ABCB1. SLC35F2 expression was significantly correlated with intratumor androgen levels in four distinct patient-derived xenograft models, and with AR activity score in a large gene expression dataset of castration-resistant metastases. A subset of tumors had significantly elevated SLC35F2 expression and, therefore, may identify patients who are highly responsive to YM155 treatment.  Implications:   The combination of androgen therapy with YM155 represents a novel drug synergy, and SLC35F2 may serve as a clinical biomarker of response to YM155.""","""['Michael D Nyquist', 'Alexandra Corella', 'John Burns', 'Ilsa Coleman', 'Shuai Gao', 'Robin Tharakan', 'Luke Riggan', 'Changmeng Cai', 'Eva Corey', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Elahe A Mostaghel']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Antitumor activity of YM155, a selective small-molecule survivin suppressant, alone and in combination with docetaxel in human malignant melanoma models.', 'Small molecule inhibitor YM155-mediated activation of death receptor 5 is crucial for chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma.', 'USP32 confers cancer cell resistance to YM155 via promoting ER-associated degradation of solute carrier protein SLC35F2.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Survivin and YM155: how faithful is the liaison?', 'The Transporter-Mediated Cellular Uptake and Efflux of Pharmaceutical Drugs and Biotechnology Products: How and Why Phospholipid Bilayer Transport Is Negligible in Real Biomembranes.', 'Effects of Androgen Receptor Inhibition on Kanamycin-Induced Hearing Loss in Rats.', 'Selective androgen receptor modulators activate the canonical prostate cancer androgen receptor program and repress cancer growth.', 'SLC35F2, a Transporter Sporadically Mutated in the Untranslated Region, Promotes Growth, Migration, and Invasion of Bladder Cancer Cells.', 'Knockdown of SLC35F2 Inhibits the Proliferation and Metastasis of Bladder Cancer Cells.']"""

K. Schum or Cascabela peruviana (L.) Lippold (commonly known as ayoyote, codo de fraile, lucky nut, or yellow oleander), native to Mexico and Central America, is a medicinal plant used traditionally to cure diseases like ulcers, scabies, hemorrhoids and dissolve tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic, antiproliferative and apoptotic activity of methanolic extract of T. peruviana fruits on human cancer cell lines.  Methods:   The cytotoxic activity of T. peruviana methanolic extract was carried out on human breast, colorectal, prostate and lung cancer cell lines and non-tumorigenic control cells (fibroblast and Vero), using the MTT assay. For proliferation and motility, clonogenic and wound-healing assays were performed. Morphological alterations were monitored by trypan blue exclusion, as well as DNA fragmentation and AO/EB double staining was performed to evaluate apoptosis. The extract was separated using flash chromatography, and the resulting fractions were evaluated on colorectal cancer cells for their cytotoxic activity. The active fractions were further analyzed through mass spectrometry.  Results:   The T. peruviana methanolic extract exhibited cytotoxic activity on four human cancer cell lines: prostate, breast, colorectal and lung, with values of IC50 1.91 ± 0.76, 5.78 ± 2.12, 6.30 ± 4.45 and 12.04 ± 3.43 μg/mL, respectively. The extract caused a significant reduction of cell motility and colony formation on all evaluated cancer cell lines. In addition, morphological examination displayed cell size reduction, membrane blebbing and detachment of cells, compared to non-treated cancer cell lines. The T. peruviana extract induced apoptotic cell death, which was confirmed by DNA fragmentation and AO/EB double staining. Fractions 4 and 5 showed the most effective cytotoxic activity and their MS analysis revealed the presence of the secondary metabolites: thevetiaflavone and cardiac glycosides.

This dual scan workflow is prone to setup and registration error. This study evaluates the feasibility of an MR-only workflow and the validity of dose calculation from an MR derived pseudo CT.  Material and methods:   Thirty prostate cancer patients were CT and MR scanned. Clinical treatment plans were generated on CT using a single 18 MV arc volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with a prescription of 78 Gy/39 fractions. Dose was recalculated on pseudo CT and assuming uniform water density. Pseudo CT and uniform density based dose calculations were compared to CT dose calculations by gamma analysis. One patient was treated with a plan based solely on MR and pseudo CT including daily image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) performed by manual match of implanted gold markers.  Results:   A pseudo CT was generated for 29 of the 30 patients. Median gamma pass rates for 1%/1 mm passing criteria for dose calculated on pseudo CT when compared to CT were 100% for most evaluated structures. Dose calculated on uniform density also yielded high median pass rates, but with a higher occurrence of pass rates below 95%. Cases of pass rate below 95% on pseudo CT proved to originate from the presence of rectal air on CT, not represented by the pseudo CT. Treatment based on MR alone was successfully delivered to one patient, including manually performed daily IGRT.  Conclusions:   Median gamma pass rates were high for pseudo CT and proved superior to uniform density. Local differences in dose calculations were concluded not to have clinical relevance.

This study presents a method of incorporating the variable RBE and its uncertainties into the proton plan robustness evaluation.  Material and methods:   The robustness evaluation was split into two parts. In part one, the worst-case physical dose was estimated using setup and range errors, including the fractionation dependence. The results were fed into part two, in which the worst-case RBE-weighted doses were estimated using a Monte Carlo method for sampling the input parameters of the chosen RBE model. The method was applied to three prostate, breast and head and neck (H&N) plans for several fractionation schedules using two RBE models. The uncertainties in the model parameters, linear energy transfer and α/β were included. The resulting DVH error bands were compared with the use of a constant RBE without uncertainties.  Results:   All plans were evaluated as robust using the constant RBE. Applying the proposed methodology using the variable RBE models broadens the DVH error bands for all structures studied. The uncertainty in α/β was the dominant factor. The variable RBE also shifted the nominal DVHs towards higher doses for most OARs, whereas the direction of this shift for the clinical target volumes (CTVs) depended on the treatment site, RBE model and fractionation schedule. The average RBE within the CTV, using one of the RBE models and 2 Gy(RBE) per fraction, varied between 1.11-1.26, 1.06-1.16 and 1.14-1.25 for the breast, H&N and prostate patients, respectively.  Conclusions:   A method of incorporating RBE uncertainties into the robustness evaluation has been proposed. By disregarding the variable RBE and its uncertainties, the variation in the RBE-weighted CTV and OAR doses may be underestimated.

Material and methods:   Planning CT (pCT) and multiple repeat CT (rCT) scans of 18 prostate cancer patients were used. Considering left and right LNs separately, the average water equivalent path length (WEPL) over all ray paths in the beams eye view of the LNs were calculated for all gantry/couch angle combinations across all rCTs versus the corresponding pCT. Single beam proton plans were optimized on the pCT for all gantry angles (0° couch) and were re-calculated on all rCTs for each respective patient. WEPL and dose parameters were extracted and a statistical clustering analysis performed to identify patient sub-populations in terms of patterns in which angles were robust.  Results:   The WEPL analysis showed a general pattern of least variation for 0° couch beam angles where three minima were found across gantry angles for the left LNs and two for the right LNs. The clustering analysis identified three patient sub-groups for the left LNs and two groups for the right LNs. The dose calculations showed similar results as the WEPL variation, e.g. for the left LNs angles around 25°-35°, 100°-110°, and 160°-170° were consistently preferable for both target and organs at risk.

Building upon a previous study identifying motion-robust proton beam angles for pelvic irradiation, we aimed to evaluate the influence of organ motion for PT using biological models, and to compare this with contemporary photon-based RT.  Material and methods:   Eight locally advanced prostate cancer patients with a planning CT (pCT) and 8-9 repeated CT scans (rCTs) were included. Two PT plans were created, one using two lateral opposed beams at gantry angles of 90°/270° and the other using two lateral oblique beams at 35°/325°; these were compared with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans. All plans were optimised on the pCT and subsequently re-calculated on each rCT (following rigid alignment on the prostate). Dose distributions in organs at risk (OARs) were evaluated using mean dose, generalized equivalent uniform doses (gEUDs) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs), while mean dose and the volume receiving 98% of the dose (V98%) were used for the targets.  Results:   PT significantly reduced the mean dose to the OARs and a correlation was seen in the pCTs between the prostate PTV overlapping the relevant OAR and OAR NTCPs, as was also the case for the VMAT plans. The best prostate target coverage across the rCTs for the IMPT plans were seen with two lateral opposed beams, although a poor coverage of the lymph node target was apparent based on V98% compared to the VMAT plans.

Patients and methods:   This was a retrospective investigation including 2 248 patients undergoing dose-escalated external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) at a single institution. We separated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) intermediate-risk prostate cancer into 'favourable' and 'unfavourable' groups based on primary Gleason pattern, percentage of positive biopsy cores (PPBC), and number of NCCN intermediate-risk factors. Similarly, NCCN high-risk prostate cancer was stratified into 'standard' and 'very high-risk' groups based on primary Gleason pattern, PPBC, number of NCCN high-risk factors, and stage T3b-T4 disease. Patients with unfavourable-intermediate-risk (UIR) prostate cancer had significantly inferior prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival (PSA-RFS, P < 0.001), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS, P < 0.001), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM, P < 0.001), and overall survival (OS, P < 0.001) compared with patients with favourable-intermediate-risk (FIR) prostate cancer. Similarly, patients with very high-risk (VHR) prostate cancer had significantly worse PSA-RFS (P < 0.001), DMFS (P < 0.001), and PCSM (P = 0.001) compared with patients with standard high-risk (SHR) prostate cancer. Moreover, patients with FIR and low-risk prostate cancer had similar outcomes, as did patients with UIR and SHR prostate cancer.  Results:   Consequently, we propose the following risk-stratification system: Group 1, low risk and FIR; Group 2, UIR and SHR; and Group 3, VHR. These groups have markedly different outcomes, with 8-year distant metastasis rates of 3%, 9%, and 29% (P < 0.001) for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and 8-year PCSM of 1%, 4%, and 13% (P < 0.001) after EBRT. This modified stratification system was significantly more accurate than the three-tiered NCCN system currently in clinical use for all outcomes.  Conclusion:   Modifying the NCCN risk-stratification system to group FIR with low-risk patients and UIR with SHR patients, results in modestly improved prediction of outcomes, potentially allowing better personalisation of therapeutic recommendations.""","""['Zachary S Zumsteg', 'Michael J Zelefsky', 'Kaitlin M Woo', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Marisa A Kollmeier', 'Sean McBride', 'Xin Pei', 'Howard M Sandler', 'Zhigang Zhang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Modified risk stratification grouping using standard clinical and biopsy information for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: Results from SEARCH.', 'Outcomes and prognostic factors in intermediate-risk prostate cancer: multi-institutional analysis of the Spanish RECAP database.', 'Very High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer: Outcomes Following Definitive Radiation.', 'Can we improve the definition of high-risk, hormone naïve, non-metastatic prostate cancer?', 'Local Failure Events in Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiotherapy: A Pooled Analysis of 18 Randomized Trials from the Meta-analysis of Randomized Trials in Cancer of the Prostate Consortium (LEVIATHAN).', 'Definitions of ""Cure"" After Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy in Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: Phoenix or Surgical?', 'Long-term results with custom-linked iodine-125 seeds and real-time brachytherapy in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: Long-Term Results.', 'Addition of Enzalutamide to Leuprolide and Definitive Radiation Therapy Is Tolerable and Effective in High-Risk Localized or Regional Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer: Results From a Phase 2 Trial.', 'PROSTATE-SPECIFIC ANTIGEN (PSA) VALUES IN PATIENTS WITH LOW- AND HIGH-RISK PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.']"""

Among specific malignancies, there was evidence that oral, oesophageal, stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, ovarian, prostate, kidney, bladder, and CNS cancers, as well as lymphoma, myeloma, and leukaemia were associated with increased zoster odds (P⩽0.05 in each case), but the magnitude of associations varied widely. The association was typically strongest within 2 years of malignancy diagnosis and decreased with older age for both haematological and solid malignancies.  Conclusions:   Several cancers were associated with an increased risk of zoster, particularly within the first 2 years after diagnosis and among younger individuals. Knowledge that patients with a recent diagnosis of cancer are at high risk of zoster may encourage initiation of antiviral therapy earlier in the course of zoster when the benefits are greater. Evaluation of whether patients diagnosed with cancer would benefit from early zoster vaccination is warranted.""","""['Erik Hansson', 'Harriet J Forbes', 'Sinéad M Langan', 'Liam Smeeth', 'Krishnan Bhaskaran']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Quantification of risk factors for herpes zoster: population based case-control study.', 'Herpes zoster as a marker of underlying malignancy.', 'Partner Bereavement and Risk of Herpes Zoster: Results from Two Population-Based Case-Control Studies in Denmark and the United Kingdom.', 'Herpes zoster is associated with an increased risk of subsequent lymphoid malignancies - a nationwide population-based matched-control study in Taiwan.', 'Medium and long-term risks of specific cardiovascular diseases in survivors of 20 adult cancers: a population-based cohort study using multiple linked UK electronic health records databases.', 'Public health impact of recombinant zoster vaccine for prevention of herpes zoster in US adults immunocompromised due to cancer.', 'Prior antibiotics and risk of subsequent Herpes zoster: A population-based case control study.', 'Vaccination for herpes zoster in patients with solid tumors: a position paper on the behalf of the Associazione Italiana di Oncologia Medica (AIOM).', 'The association of family history of herpes zoster and the risk of incident herpes zoster: the SHEZ Study.', 'Herpes zoster: A Review of Clinical Manifestations and Management.']"""

Methods:   We prospectively evaluated DNA methylation at 8q24 in relation to prostate cancer using pre-diagnostic blood samples from 694 prostate cancer cases (including 172 aggressive cases) and 703 controls in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.  Results:   Although none remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing (q>0.05), of the 50 CpG sites meeting quality control, we identified 8 sites that were nominally associated with prostate cancer (Ptrend<0.05), including 6 correlated (Spearman ρ: 0.20-0.52) sites in POU5F1B and 2 intergenic sites (most significant site: Chr8:128428897 in POU5F1B, Ptrend=0.01). We also identified two correlated (ρ=0.39) sites in MYC (Chr8:128753187 and Chr8:128753154) that were associated with aggressive (Ptrend=0.02 and 0.03), but not non-aggressive disease (Ptrend=0.70 and 0.20; Pheterogeneity=0.01 and 4.6 × 10-3).

Varlilumab is a novel, first-in-class, agonist CD27 antibody that stimulates the CD27 pathway, which results in T-cell activation and antitumor activity in tumor models. This first-in-human, dose-escalation and expansion study evaluated the safety, pharmacology, and activity of varlilumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods In a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design (n = 25), patients received a single dose of varlilumab (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10 mg/kg intravenously) with a 28-day observation, followed by up to five multidose cycles (one dose per week for 4 weeks), depending on tumor response. Expansion cohorts were initiated at 3.0 mg/kg in patients with melanoma (n = 16) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC; n = 15). Primary objectives were to assess the safety and the maximum tolerated and optimal biologic doses of varlilumab. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical antitumor activity of varlilumab. Results Exposure to varlilumab was linear and dose proportional across dose groups. Only one patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity-grade 3 transient asymptomatic hyponatremia at the 1.0-mg/kg dose level. Treatment-related adverse events were generally grade 1 or 2 in severity. Evidence of biologic activity consistent with CD27 stimulation-chemokine induction, T-cell stimulation, regulatory T cell depletion-was observed at all dose levels. A patient with metastatic RCC experienced a partial response (78% shrinkage, progression-free survival > 2.3 years). Eight patients experienced stable disease > 3 months, including a patient with metastatic RCC with progression-free survival of > 3.9 years.

Recently, however, it has been reported that CYP17 inhibitors can interact directly with the androgen receptor (AR). A phase I study recently reported that seviteronel, a CYP17 lyase-selective inhibitor, ædemonstrated a sustained reduction in prostate-specific antigen in a patient with CRPC, and another study showed seviteronel's direct effects on AR function. This suggested that seviteronel may have therapeutically relevant activities in addition to its ability to inhibit androgen production. Here, we have demonstrated that CYP17 inhibitors, with the exception of orteronel, can function as competitive AR antagonists. Conformational profiling revealed that the CYP17 inhibitor-bound AR adopted a conformation that resembled the unliganded AR (apo-AR), precluding nuclear localization and DNA binding. Further, we observed that seviteronel and abiraterone inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts expressing the clinically relevant mutation AR-F876L and that this activity could be attributed entirely to competitive AR antagonism. The results of this study suggest that the ability of CYP17 inhibitors to directly antagonize the AR may contribute to their clinical efficacy in CRPC.""","""['John D Norris', 'Stephanie J Ellison', 'Jennifer G Baker', 'David B Stagg', 'Suzanne E Wardell', 'Sunghee Park', 'Holly M Alley', 'Robert M Baldi', 'Alexander Yllanes', 'Kaitlyn J Andreano', 'James P Stice', 'Scott A Lawrence', 'Joel R Eisner', 'Douglas K Price', 'William R Moore', 'William D Figg', 'Donald P McDonnell']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['Androgen receptor antagonism and impact on inhibitors of androgen synthesis in prostate cancer therapy.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Seviteronel, a Novel CYP17 Lyase Inhibitor and Androgen Receptor Antagonist, Radiosensitizes AR-Positive Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'A novel nonsense mutation in androgen receptor confers resistance to CYP17 inhibitor treatment in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen synthesis inhibitors in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'wSDTNBI: a novel network-based inference method for virtual screening.', 'High RPS27A Expression Predicts Poor Prognosis in Patients With HPV Type 16 Cervical Cancer.', 'Steroidogenic cytochrome P450 17A1 structure and function.', 'Activity of Combined Androgen Receptor Antagonism and Cell Cycle Inhibition in Androgen Receptor Positive Triple Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Steroid Hormone Receptor and Infiltrating Immune Cell Status Reveals Therapeutic Vulnerabilities of ESR1-Mutant Breast Cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Fifteen prostate patients were studied. Each patient had 5 pairs (1 patient had 4 pairs) of pretreatment and posttreatment cone beam CTs (CBCTs). Each pair of CBCTs was registered on the basis of prostate fiducial markers. All pretreatment SVs were expanded with 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 8-mm isotropic margins to form a series of planning target volumes, and their intrafractional coverage to the posttreatment SV determined the ""ground truth"" for exact coverage. Two motion surrogates, the center of mass (COM) and the border of contour, were evaluated by the use of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and exponential fitting for predicting SV underdosage. Action threshold of each surrogate was calculated. The margin for each surrogate was calculated according to a traditional margin recipe.  Results:   Ninety-five percent posttreatment SV coverage was achieved in 9%, 53%, 73%, 86%, 95%, and 97% of fractions with 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 8-mm margins, respectively. The 5-mm margins provided 95% intrafractional SV coverage in over 90% of fractions. The correlation between the COM and border was weak, moderate, and strong in the left-right (L-R), anterior-posterior (A-P), and superior-inferior (S-I) directions, respectively. Exponential fitting gave the underdosage threshold of 4.5 and 7.0 mm for the COM and border. The Van Herk margin recipe recommended 0-, 0.5-, and 0.8-mm margins in the L-R, A-P, and S-I directions based on the COM, and 1.2-, 3.9-, and 2.5-mm margins based on the border.  Conclusions:   Five-millimeter isotropic margins for the SV constitute the minimum required to mitigate the intrafractional motion. Both the COM and the border are acceptable predictors for SV underdosage with 4.5- and 7.0-mm action threshold.

Methods and materials:   We prospectively documented the outcome of children treated in our department between 1991 and 2015 for BP RMS and undergoing a multimodal approach combining conservative surgery (partial cystectomy and/or partial prostatectomy) and perioperative interstitial low-dose-rate or pulse-dose-rate brachytherapy. Before brachytherapy, children had received chemotherapy with modalities depending on their risk group of treatment.  Results:   A total of 100 patients were identified, with a median age of 28 months (range, 5.6 months-14 years). According to the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) group, 84 were IRS-III, and 12 were IRS-IV tumors. Four patients were treated at relapse. The median number of chemotherapy cycles before local therapy was 6 (range, 4-13). After surgery, 63 patients had a macroscopic tumor residuum. Five patients underwent a brachytherapy boost before pelvic external beam radiation therapy because of nodal involvement, and 95 had exclusive brachytherapy. Median follow-up was 64 months (range, 6 months-24.5 years). Five-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 84% (95% confidence interval 80%-88%) and 91% (95% confidence interval 87%-95%), respectively. At last follow-up most survivors presented with only mild to moderate genitourinary sequelae and a normal diurnal urinary continence. Five patients required a secondary total cystectomy: 3 for a nonfunctional bladder and 2 for relapse.

Methods and materials:   We analyzed longitudinal cohort data from the Prostate Cancer Outcomes and Satisfaction with Treatment Quality Assessment Consortium to ascertain the HRQOL trajectory of men receiving NADT with external beam RT (EBRT) or brachytherapy. HRQOL was measured using the expanded prostate cancer index composite 26-item questionnaire at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months after the initiation of NADT.

Results:   For subjects receiving EBRT, questions regarding the ability to have an erection, ability to reach an orgasm, quality of erections, frequency of erections, ability to function sexually, and lack of energy were in a significantly worse dichotomized category for the patients receiving NADT. Comparing the baseline versus 24-month outcomes, 24%, 23%, and 30% of participants receiving EBRT plus NADT shifted to the worse dichotomized category for the ability to reach an orgasm, quality of erections, and ability to function sexually compared with 14%, 13%, and 16% in the EBRT group, respectively.  Conclusions:   Compared with baseline, at 2 years, participants receiving NADT plus EBRT compared with EBRT alone had worse HRQOL, as measured by the ability to reach orgasm, quality of erections, and ability to function sexually.

Methods:   We identified 332 men who received SRT after prostatectomy from 1987 to 2010. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) identified favorable, intermediate and unfavorable groups based on the risk of failure after SRT alone. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests compared FFS with and without ADT.  Results:   Forty-three percent received SRT alone and 57% received SRT with ADT (median 6.6 months (interquartile range (IQR) 5.8-18.1) ADT). Median SRT dose was 70 Gy (IQR 70-70), and median follow-up after SRT was 6.7 years (IQR 4.5-10.8). On Cox's proportional hazard regression, ADT improved FFS (adjusted hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.86; P=0.006). RPA classified unfavorable disease as negative surgical margins (SMs) and preradiation PSA of ⩾0.5 ng ml-1. Favorable disease had neither adverse factor, and intermediate disease had one adverse factor. The addition of ADT to SRT improved 5-year FFS for men with unfavorable disease (70.3% vs 23.4%; P<0.001) and intermediate disease (69.8% vs 48.0%; P=0.003), but not for men with favorable disease (81.2% vs 78.0%; P=0.971).  Conclusions:   The addition of ADT to SRT appears to improve FFS for men with a preradiation PSA of ⩾0.5 ng ml-1 or with negative SM at prostatectomy. Men with involved surgical margins and PSA <0.5 ng ml-1 appear to be at a lower risk of failure after SRT alone and may not derive as much benefit from the administration of ADT with SRT.

Methods:   Retrospective analyses of a prospectively maintained database for 769 patients with D'Amico high-risk PCa undergoing RARP at two tertiary care centers in the United States and Europe between 2001 and 2014. The association between time since RARP and recovery of UC (defined as 0 pad/one safety liner per day) and SF (defined as sexual health inventory for men (SHIM) score ⩾17) was tested in separate preoperative and post-operative Cox-proportional hazards regression models.

Methods:   We applied a predefined search strategy to identify all news articles reporting on ProtecT within 30 days of its publication. Articles were independently assessed by two urologists and two lay persons using five-point Likert scales. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were used.  Results:   Of 33 unique articles identified, 20 (61%) conveyed negative views on definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer (PCa), while 29 (88%) expressed favorable views of active surveillance/monitoring (AM). Nevertheless, fewer than half of the articles described what AM entails (n=15; 46%) or the rate of treatment in the AM arm (n=12; 36%). Moreover, while 32 (97%) articles highlighted the absence of a difference in cancer-specific mortality at 10 years, only 17 (52%) mentioned the need for longer follow-up. A total of 17 (52%) articles had a notable degree of perceived bias (⩾4/5 on Likert scale), with shorter articles (P=0.02), articles covering few content areas (P=0.03) and articles that did not detail what AM entails (P=0.003) containing significantly increased bias.  Conclusions:   The majority of news articles regarding ProtecT presented an adverse view of definitive treatment for localized PCa relative to AM, but failed to highlight key nuances of the trial.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of SBRT in delaying the start of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Patients and methods:   Forty-three patients treated with SBRT for oligometastatic recurrence (< 5 metastases) of hormone-sensitive PC, defined with [18F]fluoromethylcholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography were included. As a control group, 20 patients with oligometastatic disease not treated with SBRT were identified from another hospital. Data were collected retrospectively.  Results:   A post-SBRT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was seen in 29 (67.4%) of 43 patients. Median ADT-free survival (ADT-FS) was 15.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.7-19.5) for the whole group, and 25.7 months (95% CI, 9.0-42.4) for patients with a PSA response. Seven patients were treated with a second course of SBRT because of oligometastatic disease recurrence; the ADT-FS in this group was 32.1 months (95% CI, 7.8-56.5). Compared with the control group, the ADT-FS from first diagnosis of metastasis was significantly longer, with 17.3 (95% CI, 13.7-20.9) months versus 4.19 months (95% CI, 0.0-9.0), P < .001. Also, time between diagnosis of the metastasis until progression of disease during ADT use (castration resistance) was longer for the SBRT-treated patients (mean 66.6, 95% CI, 53.5-79.8, vs. 36.41, 95% CI, 26.0-46.8 months, P = .020).

The objective of this study was to determine the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in high-grade prostate cancer tissues, and correlate the expression with disease and patient characteristics.  Materials and methods:   Immunohistochemistry for PD-1 (CD279), PD-L1 (B7-H1), and CD3 was performed and scored from 0 to 5 on prostatectomy/biopsy tissue samples taken from 25 men with high-grade prostate cancer. Charts were then retrospectively reviewed for numerous patient and disease characteristics. Statistical analyses were done to investigate the association of these patient and disease characteristics with PD-1, PD-L1, and CD3 expression.  Results:   A score of 3 to 5 on the semiquantitative 0 to 5 score was deemed ""high"" expression whereas a score of 0 to 2 was deemed ""low"" expression. Of the 25 samples, 2 (8%) scored high for PD-1 expression, 2 (8%) scored high for PD-L1 expression, and 18 (72%) scored high for CD3 expression. There was no statistically significant difference between high and low expression groups of PD-1, PD-L1, or CD3 for any of the variables we collected.  Conclusion:   An overall low expression of PD-1 and PD-L1, and a concurrent high expression of CD3+ T cells was found in high-risk prostate cancer tissue. No significant association was found between expression of PD-1, PD-L1, or CD3, and patient or disease characteristics.

In the 60 biopsies without a seminal vesicle, GATA-3 was positive in the prostate basal cells and even in the secretory cells (57 cases), although with less intensity in 55 of the cases. One of the 36 prostatic adenocarcinomas tested positive for GATA-3.  Conclusions:   The intense immunohistochemical expression of GATA-3 in the seminal vesicle epithelium can help identify the epithelium in prostate biopsies. This marker is also positive in the basal cells of healthy prostates and, with less intensity, in the secretory cells. Positivity, weak or moderate, is observed on rare occasions in prostatic adenocarcinomas.""","""['J A Ortiz-Rey', 'D Chantada-de la Fuente', 'M Á Peteiro-Cancelo', 'C Gómez-de María', 'M P San Miguel-Fraile']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Seminal epithelium in prostate biopsy can mimic malignant and premalignant prostatic lesions.', 'The distribution of PAX-2 immunoreactivity in the prostate gland, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct: comparison with prostatic adenocarcinoma and discussion of prostatic zonal embryogenesis.', 'Indications for preoperative seminal vesicle biopsies in staging of clinically localized prostatic cancer.', 'Seminal vesicle intraepithelial neoplasia versus basal cell hyperplasia in a seminal vesicle.', 'Primary seminal vesicle carcinoma.

Dosimetric parameters were linked with toxicity to test the hypothesis that delivered dose is a stronger predictor of toxicity than planned dose.  Material and methods:   Dose-surface maps (DSMs) of the rectal wall were automatically generated from daily MVCT scans for 109 patients within the VoxTox research programme. Accumulated-DSMs, representing total delivered dose, and planned-DSMs, from planning CT data, were parametrised using Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD) and 'DSM dose-width', the lateral dimension of an ellipse fitted to a discrete isodose cluster. Associations with 6 toxicity endpoints were assessed using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis.  Results:   For rectal bleeding, the area under the curve (AUC) was greater for accumulated dose than planned dose for DSM dose-widths up to 70Gy. Accumulated 65Gy DSM dose-width produced the strongest spatial correlation (AUC 0.664), while accumulated EUD generated the largest AUC overall (0.682). For proctitis, accumulated EUD was the only reportable predictor (AUC 0.673). Accumulated EUD was systematically lower than planned EUD.

This study aimed to investigate the association between BMI and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP in a large international contemporary cohort of patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data from 6,519 patients who underwent RP at 5 institutions. BMI was analyzed as both a continuous and categorical variable (<25kg/m2, 25-29.9kg/m2 [overweight], and≥30kg/m2 [obese]). The associations of continuous and categorical BMI with BCR were evaluated using univariable and multivariable Cox models, and prognostic accuracy was assessed using Harrell׳s C-index.  Results:   The median BMI was 28kg/m2 (interquartile range: 24-32kg/m2); 2,155 patients (33.1%) had a BMI = 25 to 29.9kg/m2 and 2,462 patients (37.7%) had a BMI≥30kg/m². Overweight and obese status were associated with extracapsular extension (P = 0.001) and seminal vesicle invasion (P = 0.005). The median follow-up was 28 months, and the estimated 5-year BCR-free survival rates for patients with a BMI<25kg/m2, 25 to 29.9kg/m2, and≥30kg/m² were 92%, 86%, and 79%, respectively (P<0.001). Multivariable analyses (adjusted for preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels, biopsy Gleason score, and clinical stage) revealed that obesity was associated with the risk of extracapsular extension (P<0.001), seminal vesicle invasion (P<0.001), and BCR (hazard ratio: 1.37, P<0.001). BMI and obesity remained associated with BCR after adjusting for postoperative characteristics. Addition of BMI slightly increased the discrimination of the multivariable clinical prognostic model (from 79.9%-80.9%).

Metformin, the most common used anti-type-2 diabetes medicine, has been linked to reduced cancer risk and better diagnosis. We found that metformin was able to inhibit PCa cell migration, which correlates with tumor metastatic capability. The pathogenesis and progression of tumors are closely related to dysregulated gene expression in tumor cells through epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. We found that the level of SUV39H1, a histone methyltransferase of H3 Lys9, was reduced in metformin-treated PCa cells in a time-dependent manner. SUV39H1 overexpression increased PCa migration, whereas SUV39H1 depletion suppressed PCa cell migration. There is a positive correlation between SUV39H1 expression and PCa pathological stages. We further showed that both metformin treatment and SUV39H1 knockout in PCa cells can reduce integrin αV and β1 proteins, as well as their downstream phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) levels, which is essential for functional adhesion signaling and tumor cell migration. Taken together, metformin reduced SUV39H1 to inhibit migration of PCa cells via disturbing the integrin-FAK signaling.

Recent experiments using purified recombinant human DHRS7 suggested several potential substrates, including the steroids cortisone and Δ4-androstene-3,17-dione (androstenedione). However, the substrate and cofactor concentrations used in these experiments were very high and the physiological relevance of these observations needed to be further investigated. In the present study, recombinant human DHRS7 was expressed in intact HEK-293 cells in order to investigate whether glucocorticoids and androgens serve as substrates at sub-micromolar concentrations and at physiological cofactor concentrations. Furthermore, the membrane topology of DHRS7 was revisited using redox-sensitive green-fluorescent protein fusions in living cells. The results revealed that (1) cortisone is a substrate of DHRS7; however, it is not reduced to cortisol but to 20β-dihydrocortisone, (2) androstenedione is not a relevant substrate of DHRS7, (3) DHRS7 catalyzes the oxoreduction of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5αDHT) to 3α-androstanediol (3αAdiol), with a suppressive effect on androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, and (4) DHRS7 is anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with a cytoplasmic orientation. Together, the results show that DHRS7 is a cytoplasmic oriented enzyme exhibiting 3α/20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, with a possible role in the modulation of AR function.

In recent years, progress has been made in the understanding of the genetics of acinar adenocarcinomas, and at least 7 genetically different subtypes have been identified. DAC is known to present at an advanced stage with a high rate of extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion, and a decreased interval to biochemical recurrence and the development of metastatic disease when compared with acinar adenocarcinoma. Our aim was to investigate the genetic profile of DAC to determine whether there is a genomic rationale for the aggressive behavior associated with this tumor type. Frozen tissue from 11 cases of DAC with paired benign tissue was analyzed. After DNA extraction, copy-number alteration analysis was performed, as well as identification of mutations and indels. We compared the fraction of the DAC genome with copy-number alteration to previous results from 74 primary acinar adenocarcinomas of the prostate. The alteration rate in DAC was comparable to that of acinar adenocarcinoma of high Gleason score. DAC harbored somatic changes seen in advanced and/or metastatic castration-resistant acinar adenocarcinoma, which likely accounts for its aggressive biological behavior.""","""['Amanda H Seipel', 'Thomas Whitington', 'Brett Delahunt', 'Hemamali Samaratunga', 'Markus Mayrhofer', 'Peter Wiklund', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Johan Lindberg', 'Lars Egevad']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: A systematic review and meta-analysis of incidence, presentation, prognosis, and management.', 'Pathologic stage of prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma at radical prostatectomy: effect of percentage of the ductal component and associated grade of acinar adenocarcinoma.', 'Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: Clinical and biological profiles.', 'Multiple Origin and Tumor Heterogeneity of Prostatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma in the Han Chinese Population.', 'Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: histogenesis, biology and clinicopathological features.', 'Ductal prostate cancer: Clinical features and outcomes from a multicenter retrospective analysis and overview of the current literature.', 'Genomic analysis of aggressive ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'WHO Classification of Tumours fifth edition: evolving issues in the classification, diagnosis, and prognostication of prostate cancer.', 'Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: A systematic review and meta-analysis of incidence, presentation, prognosis, and management.']"""

Toward this end, we evaluated (1) differences in the prevalence of MH problems between PC survivors and age-matched men from the general population (GenPop) and (2) correlates of MH in PC survivors and the GenPop.  Methods and materials:   In this observational case-control study, we age-matched PC survivors (n = 644, alive≥5y after diagnosis of a stage I-IV carcinoma) recruited from Dutch community hospitals (Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long-term Evaluation of Survivorship registry) with GenPop peers (n = 644) selected from a population-based sample recruited in general practices (NIVEL). MH was operationalized using the 5-item Mental Health Inventory of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Potential correlates of MH included sociodemographic characteristics, health-related quality of life scores, and clinical characteristics (PC survivors only). We used analysis of (co)variance and chi-square tests to address the 2 research questions.  Results:   We observed clinically relevant MH symptoms in 14% of the PC survivors and 6% of the GenPop controls (P<0.01, odds ratio = 2.45 [1.66-3.62]). The most important correlates of lower MH scores in the PC survivors were being widowed, a lower educational level, lower general health perceptions, more bodily pain and urinary bother, and less sexual satisfaction. The most important correlates of lower MH scores in the GenPop were as follows: lower general health perceptions, more role limitations because of physical problems, and more bodily pain.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that long-term PC survivors have poorer MH, as assessed by the 5-item Mental Health Inventory questionnaire, than men of a comparable age from the GenPop without a history of PC. Attention to potentially modifiable factors associated with MH problems in PC survivors, such as urinary function and its related bother, bodily pain, and sexual satisfaction, may help to prevent or limit MH problems in this survivor population.""","""['Marie-Anne van Stam', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'J L H Ruud Bosch', 'Corinne N Tillier', 'Simon Horenblas', 'Floor Mols', 'Neil K Aaronson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Age-specific health-related quality of life in disease-free long-term prostate cancer survivors versus male population controls-results from a population-based study.', 'Health-related quality of life among long-term (≥5\xa0years) prostate cancer survivors by primary intervention: a systematic review.', 'Examining relationships between age at diagnosis and health-related quality of life outcomes in prostate cancer survivors.', 'Health-related quality of life in children and adolescents who have a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.', 'Mental health outcomes during colorectal cancer survivorship: a review of the literature.', 'Physical and psychosocial factors associated with sexual satisfaction in long-term cancer survivors 5 and 10\xa0years after diagnosis.', 'Racial Disparities and Mental Health Effects Within Prostate Cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life in patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer: CAPLIFE study.', 'Assessing an Internet-Delivered, Emotion-Focused Intervention Compared With a Healthy Lifestyle Active Control Intervention in Improving Mental Health in Cancer Survivors: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Relationship communication and the course of psychological outcomes among couples coping with localised prostate cancer.']"""

Recommendations are based on historical series.  Objectives:   To determine outcomes and toxicity of contemporary salvage radiation therapy (SRT) to the prostate bed.  Methods:   We reviewed a prospective ethics committee-approved database of 229 patients referred for SRT. Median pre-radiation prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 0.5 ng/ml and median follow-up was 50.4 months (range 13.7-128). Treatment was planned and delivered using modern three-dimensional radiation techniques. Mean bioequivalent dose was 71 Gy (range 64-83 Gy). Progression was defined as two consecutive increases in PSA level > 0.2 ng/ml, metastases on follow-up imaging, commencement of anti-androgen treatment for any reason, or death from prostate cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and multivariate analysis was performed using STATA.  Results:   Five year progression-free survival was 68% (95%CI 59.8-74.8%), and stratified by PSA was 87%, 70% and 47% for PSA < 0.3, 0.3-0.7, and > 0.7 ng/ml (P < 0.001). Metastasis-free survival was 92.5%, prostate cancer-specific survival 96.4%, and overall survival 94.9%. Low pre-radiation PSA value was the most important predictor of progression-free survival (HR 2.76, P < 0.001). Daily image guidance was associated with reduced risk of gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity (P < 0.005).  Conclusions:   Contemporary SRT is associated with favorable outcomes.

We investigated its diagnostic performance in prostate cancer patients with and without skeletal metastasis and searched for the problems.  Methods:   An artificial neural network (ANN) value was calculated in 226 prostate cancer patients (124 with skeletal metastasis and 101 without) using BS. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed and the sensitivity and specificity determined (cutoff ANN = 0.5). Patient's situation at the time of diagnosis of skeletal metastasis, computed tomography (CT) type, extent of disease (EOD), and BS uptake grade were analyzed. False-negative and false-positive results were recorded.  Results:   BONENAVI showed 82% (102/124) of sensitivity and 83% (84/101) specificity for metastasis detection. There were no significant differences among CT types, although low EOD and faint BS uptake were associated with low ANN values and low sensitivity. Patients showed lower sensitivity during the follow-up period than staging work-up. False-negative lesions were often located in the pelvis or adjacent to it. They comprised not only solitary, faint BS lesions but also overlaying to urinary excretion.  Conclusions:   BONENAVI with BS has good sensitivity and specificity for detecting prostate cancer's osseous metastasis. Low EOD and faint BS uptake are associated with low sensitivity but not the CT type.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent palliative surgery for MBO between 2007 and 2015. Laparoscopic procedures have been performed when technically possible since 2014. Successful palliation was defined as the ability to tolerate solid food (TSF) for at least 2 weeks.  Results:   Twenty-two patients underwent laparoscopic palliative surgery, and 171 patients underwent conventional open palliative surgery to relieve the symptoms of MBO. Laparoscopic palliative surgery was performed for patients with MBO due to colorectal cancer (n = 12), uterine cancer (n = 3), and other types of cancers (including gastric, prostate, and renal cancer). The following laparoscopic procedures were performed: stoma placement (n = 18), palliative resection (n = 3) and bypass (n = 2). The median operative time was 100 min and the median operative blood loss was 9 ml. The laparoscopic palliative operation allowed 91% (20/22) of the patients to consume a solid diet for more than 2 weeks, and be discharged from hospital. There were no significant differences between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery with regard to the ability to TSF or the postoperative mortality rate. The postoperative morbidity (Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥ II) rates in the laparoscopic and open surgery groups were 14% and 32%, respectively. Laparoscopic surgery led to a significantly lower rate of postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) in comparison to open surgery (4.5% vs 32%; P = 0.0053).

Materials and methods:   Men presenting for primary TPSB from 2007 to 2014 were considered. Histological outcomes were assessed and defined as: presence of any cancer or significant cancer defined as presence of Gleason 4 and/or maximum tumour core length (MCCL) ≥ 4 mm (G4); or Gleason 4 and/or MCCL ≥ 6 mm (G6). Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were calculated, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were generated to compare MR-PSAD and PSA.

In cancers, irregular E3 ligase activity drives proteasomal degradation of tumor suppressor proteins. Accordingly, E3 ligase inhibitors define a rational therapy to restore tumor suppression. The relevant tumor suppressors targeted by E6AP in PC are yet to be fully identified. In this study we show that p27, a key cell cycle regulator, is a target of E6AP in PC. Down regulation of E6AP increases p27 expression and enhances its nuclear accumulation in PC. We demonstrate that E6AP regulates p27 expression by inhibiting its transcription in an E2F1-dependent manner. Concomitant knockdown of E6AP and p27 partially restores PC cell growth, supporting the contribution of p27 to the overall effect of E6AP on prostate tumorigenesis.

Recently, we developed self-assembling nanoparticles (NPS) encapsulating zoledronic acid (NZ) that allowed a higher intratumor delivery of the drug compared with free zoledronic acid (ZA) in in vivo cancer models of PCa. Increasing evidence suggests that Bone Marrow (BM) Mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are recruited into the stroma of developing tumors where they contribute to progression by enhancing tumor growth and metastasis.We demonstrated that treatment with NZ decreased migration and differentiation into adipocytes and osteoblasts of MSCs and inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Treatment with NZ reduced the capability of MSCs to promote the migration and the clonogenic growth of the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145. The levels of Interleukin-6 and of the pro-angiogenic factors VEGF and FGF-2 were significantly reduced in MSC-CM derived from MSCs treated with NZ, and CCL5 secretion was almost totally abolished. Moreover, treatment of MSCs with supernatants from PC3 cells, leading to tumor-educated MSCs (TE-MSCs), increased the secretion of IL-6, CCL5, VEGF and FGF-2 by MSCs and increased their capability to increase PC3 cells clonogenic growth. Treatment with NZ decreased cytokine secretion and the pro-tumorigenic effects also of TE-MSCS.

The molecular mechanisms involved PNP-induced damage remain to be established. Autophagy can exert protective effects on various cytotoxic factors that induce injury. In the present study, we aim to investigate whether autophagy is induced by PNP and the function of autophagy in PNP-induced injury in NHPrE1, a normal human prostate epithelial progenitor cell line. Our results indicate that PNP induced oxidative stress as evidenced by increased MDA levels and decreased activity of SOD and GSH-Px. PNP also increased apoptosis of NHPrE1 cells as evidenced by western blot and Hoechst 33258 staining and activated autophagy in NHPrE1 cells detected by RT-PCR and western blot. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA further increased PNP-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of NHPrE1 cells. We also found that PNP-induced apoptosis was suppressed by N-acetylcysteine, suggesting oxidative stress may play an important role in PNP cytotoxicity. Furthermore, phosphorylation of mTOR protein was inhibited by PNP, indicating that PNP might induce autophagy in NHPrE1 cells via inhibiting mTOR pathway. In conclusion, these results suggest that activation of autophagy should play a protective role in PNP-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of NHPrE1 cells, which might be mediated through mTOR pathway.""","""['Yonghui Zhang', 'Chong Zhang', 'Fulu Dong', 'Miaomiao Chen', 'Jingchen Cao', 'Haiyan Wang', 'Ming Jiang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Regul Toxicol Pharmacol""","""['4-Nitrophenol induces activation of Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and apoptosis of the germ cells in rat testes.', 'Induction of autophagy by salidroside through the AMPK-mTOR pathway protects vascular endothelial cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.', 'Potential protective effect of arginine against 4-nitrophenol-induced ovarian damage in rats.', 'Amorphous silica nanoparticles trigger vascular endothelial cell injury through apoptosis and autophagy via reactive oxygen species-mediated MAPK/Bcl-2 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.', 'Impaired lysosomal activity mediated autophagic flux disruption by graphite carbon nanofibers induce apoptosis in human lung epithelial cells through oxidative stress and energetic impairment.', 'Hippocampal PPARα is a novel therapeutic target for depression and mediates the antidepressant actions of fluoxetine in mice.']"""

Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the results of mpMRI (with or without suspicious upstaging). The variables for predicting significant PCa, defined as locally advanced PCa, Gleason score≥7, or tumor volume>0.5cc or all of these, and adverse PCa, defined as locally advanced PCa, Gleason score≥7 (4+3), or tumor volume>2.5cc or all of these, were assessed.  Results:   The mpMRI led to ""suspicious"" upstaging in 56 patients (15.4%). Significant PCa (98.2% vs. 74.6%, P<0.001) and adverse PCa (85.7% vs. 32.6%, P<0.001) were more common in patients with suspicious upstaging. The sensitivity/specificity of mpMRI for significant PCa and adverse PCa were 25.4%/98.2% and 32.4%/96.3%, respectively. On multivariate analyses, suspicious upstaging on mpMRI (odds ratio: 15.82, P = 0.007) was a predictor for significant PCa in addition to PRIAS criteria and age at diagnosis. In addition, suspicious upstaging on mpMRI (odds ratio: 11.11, P<0.001) was a significant predictor for adverse PCa in addition to PRIAS criteria, age at diagnosis, and body mass index.

We selected for this study a total of 17 previously treated patients with a range of pelvic disease sites including prostate (9), bladder (1), uterus (3), rectum (3), and cervix (1). For each patient, 2 plans were generated, one using an arc-per-beam setting of ""1"" and another with an arc-per-beam setting of ""2"" using the volumes and constraints established from the initial clinical treatments. All constraints and dose coverage objects were kept the same between plans, and all plans were normalized to 99.7% to ensure 100% of the planning target volume (PTV) received 95% of the prescription dose. Plans were evaluated for PTV conformity, homogeneity, number of monitor units, number of control points, and overall plan acceptability. Treatment delivery time, patient-specific quality assurance procedures, and the impact on clinical workflow were also assessed. We found that for complex-shaped target volumes (small central volumes with extending arms to cover nodal regions), the use of 2 arc-per-beam (2APB) parameter setting achieved significantly lower average dose-volume histogram values for the rectum V20 (p = 0.0012) and bladder V30 (p = 0.0036) while meeting the high dose target constraints. For simple PTV shapes, we found reduced monitor units (13.47%, p = 0.0009) and control points (8.77%, p = 0.0004) using 2APB planning. In addition, we found a beam delivery time reduction of approximately 25%. In summary, the dosimetric benefit, although moderate, was improved over a 1APB setting for complex PTV, and equivalent in other cases. The overall reduced delivery time suggests that the use of mulitple arcs per beam could lead to reduced patient-on-table time, increased clinical throughput, and reduced medical physics quality assurance effort.""","""['Alan M Kalet', 'Hannah L Richardson', 'Darrin A Nikolaisen', 'Ning Cao', 'Myra A Lavilla', 'Claire Dempsey', 'Juergen Meyer', 'Wui-Jin Koh', 'Kenneth J Russell']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Dosimetric quality, accuracy, and deliverability of modulated radiotherapy treatments for spinal metastases.', 'Dosimetric comparison of two arc-based stereotactic body radiotherapy techniques for early-stage lung cancer.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy planning using multicriteria optimization for localized prostate cancer.', 'Treatment planning strategy for whole-brain radiotherapy with hippocampal sparing and simultaneous integrated boost for multiple brain metastases using intensity-modulated arc therapy.', 'Automated Plan Checking Software Demonstrates Continuous and Sustained Improvements in Safety and Quality: A 3-year Longitudinal Analysis.', 'Dosimetric comparison of tomotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy for children with neuroblastoma.']"""

In order to identify novel exosomal markers for prostate cancer (PC), we performed proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from PC cell lines and examined the usefulness of the marker in patients.  Methods:   Exosomes isolated by differential centrifugation from the culture medium of androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and its sublines of partially androgen-independent C4, androgen-independent C4-2 and bone metastatic C4-2B were subjected to iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis. Exosomes were also isolated by immunocapture and separated by size exclusion chromatography and density gradient centrifugation. Protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis. GGT activity was measured using a fluorescent probe, γ-glutamyl hydroxymethyl rhodamine green (gGlu-HMRG). Immunohistochemical analysis of tissues was performed using anti-GGT1 antibody.  Results:   Among proteins upregulated in C4-2 and C4-2B cells than in LNCaP cells, we focused on gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1), a cell-surface enzyme that regulates the catabolism of extracellular glutathione. The levels of both GGT1 large and small subunits were elevated in exosomes isolated from C4-2 and C4-2B cells by differential centrifugation and by immunocapture with anti-CD9 or -prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibody. In cell lysates and exosomes, GGT1 expression correlated with GGT activity. Size exclusion chromatography of human serum demonstrated the presence of GGT activity and GGT1 subunits in fractions positive for CD9. Density gradient centrifugation revealed the co-presence of GGT1 subunits with CD9 in exosomes isolated by differential centrifugation from human serum. Since GGT activity correlated with GGT1 expression in serum exosomes isolated by differential centrifugation, we measured serum exosomal GGT activity in patients. Unexpectedly, we found that serum exosomal GGT activity was significantly higher in PC patients than in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients. In support of this finding, immunohistochemical analysis showed increased GGT1 expression in PC tissues compared with BPH tissues.

The Self-Rating Depression Scale scores of the 3 groups showed significant differences at 1 month (P < .001), 6 months (P = .009), 9 months (P < .001), 12 months (P < .001), and 15 months (P < .001). At 9 months, 12% of the men in the ADT group, 4.3% in the RP group, and 2% in the BPH group showed depressive symptoms, and there were no significant differences (P = .095). However, there were significant differences among the 3 groups relative to the incidence of depressive symptoms at 12 and 15 months (P < .001, P = .007, respectively). The analysis of the ADT subgroup indicated that alcohol consumption (odds ratio = 6.868; P = .046; 95% CI, 1.038-45.443) and smoking (odds ratio = 13.661; P = 0.013; 95% CI, 1.722-108.386) increased the risk for developing depressive symptoms.  Conclusions:   Androgen deprivation therapy use does significantly increase the depressive scores and enhance the incidence of depression among PCa patients who received ADT.

The 68Ga HBED-PSMA (PSMA-HBED) ligand has been most widely used and can be considered the current gold standard agent. Further PSMA ligands based on the DOTAGA and DOTA conjugates have more recently been developed. These agents (PSMA-I&T and PSMA-617) have potential theranostic capabilities as they can be conjugated with therapeutic radioisotopes. In this study, we examine whether PSMA-I&T has comparative efficacy, such that it could replace PSMA-HBED as a diagnostic agent in prostate carcinoma.  Methods:   19 patients with PCa referred for 68Ga-PSMA imaging were imaged with PSMA-HBED and PSMA-I&T PET-CT imaging within a 2-week period. The two pharmaceuticals were synthesised using click chemistry. Imaging was performed using the same standardised methodology on a Siemens Biograph mCT. All sites of PSMA binding thought to represent PCa (probable or definite) were included in a lesion analysis that examined lesion concordance and lesional binding efficiency (SUVpeak) between the two radiopharmaceuticals. For each patient, SUVmean of the LV cavity blood pool, bone, muscle and liver were determined as image background measures.  Results:   Across all patients, PSMA uptake was observed in 47 lesions (10 bone lesions, 19 nodal lesions, 18 high-grade intraprostatic binding). Lesions were concordant between the agents in all except for two small (<4 mm) nodal lesions which were not visualised with PSMA-I&T. SUVpeak assessment showed significantly greater overall lesion binding with HBED (paired t test, p = 0.0001). LV blood pool and bone marrow SUVmean were significantly higher for I&T than HBED (paired t test, blood pool p < 1 × 10-5, bone marrow p < 0.005).  Conclusion:   Intra-patient comparative imaging demonstrates higher lesional PSMA-HBED binding than PSMA-I&T and that the HBED agent is likely to have better lesion contrast. While there was concordance in 96% of lesions, 2 small nodal lesions were appreciated with PSMA-HBED imaging while considered normal with PSMA-I&T. These findings suggest that HBED-PSMA has a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy in comparison to PSMA-I&T.""","""['Michael McCarthy', 'Tiffany Langton', 'Divesh Kumar', 'Andrew Campbell']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Comparison of (18)FDCFPyL and  (68)GaGa-PSMA-HBED-CC for PSMA-PET Imaging in Patients with Relapsed Prostate Cancer.', 'A Multicenter Prospective Clinical Trial of 68Gallium PSMA HBED-CC PET-CT Restaging in Biochemically Relapsed Prostate Carcinoma: Oligometastatic Rate and Distribution Compared With Standard Imaging.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in the management of recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for Prostate Cancer Management at Initial Staging and Time of Biochemical Recurrence.', 'The effects of trace metal impurities on Ga-68-radiolabelling with a tris(3-hydroxy-1,6-dimethylpyridin-4-one) (THP) chelator.', 'Differences in Distribution and Detection Rate of the 68GaGa-PSMA Ligands PSMA-617, -I&T and -11-Inter-Individual Comparison in Patients with Biochemical Relapse of Prostate Cancer.', 'Validation of HPLC method for the determination of chemical andradiochemical purity of a 68Ga-labelled EuK-Sub-kf-(3-iodo-y-) DOTAGA.', 'Radiolabelled Peptides for Positron Emission Tomography and Endoradiotherapy in Oncology.', '68Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT for primary staging of prostate cancer.']"""

The objective of this study was to examine the value of the new PET tracer 18F-PSMA-1007 for the staging of local disease by comparing it with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and radical prostatectomy (RP) histopathology. Methods: In 2016, 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT was performed in 10 men with biopsy-confirmed high-risk PCa. Nine patients underwent mpMRI in the process of primary diagnosis. Consecutively, RP was performed in all 10 men. Agreement analysis was performed retrospectively. PSMA staining was added for representative sections in RP specimen slices. Localization and agreement analysis of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT, mpMRI, and RP specimens was performed by dividing the prostate into 38 sections as described in the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) (version 2). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values (NPVs), and accuracy were calculated for total and near-total agreement.

Accordingly, efforts are under way to develop strategies for monitoring and inhibiting AR-V7 in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The purpose of this study was to understand whether other AR variants may be coexpressed with AR-V7 and promote resistance to AR-targeted therapies.Experimental Design: We utilized complementary short- and long-read sequencing of intact AR mRNA isoforms to characterize AR expression in CRPC models. Coexpression of AR-V7 and AR-V9 mRNA in CRPC metastases and circulating tumor cells was assessed by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, respectively. Expression of AR-V9 protein in CRPC models was evaluated with polyclonal antisera. Multivariate analysis was performed to test whether AR variant mRNA expression in metastatic tissues was associated with a 12-week progression-free survival endpoint in a prospective clinical trial of 78 CRPC-stage patients initiating therapy with the androgen synthesis inhibitor, abiraterone acetate.Results: AR-V9 was frequently coexpressed with AR-V7. Both AR variant species were found to share a common 3' terminal cryptic exon, which rendered AR-V9 susceptible to experimental manipulations that were previously thought to target AR-V7 uniquely. AR-V9 promoted ligand-independent growth of prostate cancer cells. High AR-V9 mRNA expression in CRPC metastases was predictive of primary resistance to abiraterone acetate (HR = 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-12.2; P = 0.02).Conclusions: AR-V9 may be an important component of therapeutic resistance in CRPC.

Using a novel proteomic technique, we identified a new AR coregulator, the transcription factor Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2), and demonstrated its essential role in the oncogenic AR signaling axis. GRHL2 colocalized with AR in prostate tumors and was frequently amplified and upregulated in prostate cancer. Importantly, GRHL2 maintained AR expression in multiple prostate cancer model systems, was required for cell proliferation, enhanced AR's transcriptional activity, and colocated with AR at specific sites on chromatin to regulate genes relevant to disease progression. GRHL2 is itself an AR-regulated gene, creating a positive feedback loop between the two factors. The link between GRHL2 and AR also applied to constitutively active truncated AR variants (ARV), as GRHL2 interacted with and regulated ARVs and vice versa. These oncogenic functions of GRHL2 were counterbalanced by its ability to suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion. Mechanistic evidence suggested that AR assisted GRHL2 in maintaining the epithelial phenotype. In summary, this study has identified a new AR coregulator with a multifaceted role in prostate cancer, functioning as an enhancer of the oncogenic AR signaling pathway but also as a suppressor of metastasis-related phenotypes.

Recently, we developed TCTP antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to inhibit TCTP expression. However, the intracellular delivery and silencing activity of these oligonucleotides remains a challenge, and depend on the use of transfection agents and delivery systems. Here we show that lipid-modified ASO (LASOs) has improved penetration and efficiency in inhibiting TCTP expression in the absence of additional transfection agents, both in vitro and in vivo. Transfection with TCTP-LASO led to rapid and prolonged internalization via macropinocytosis, TCTP downregulation and significant decreased cell viability. We also show that lipid-modification led to delayed tumor progression in CRPC xenografts models, with no significant toxic effects observed.""","""['Sara Karaki', 'Sebastien Benizri', 'Raquel Mejías', 'Virginie Baylot', 'Nicolas Branger', 'Tan Nguyen', 'Brune Vialet', 'Khalid Oumzil', 'Philippe Barthélémy', 'Palma Rocchi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['The MCT4 Gene: A Novel, Potential Target for Therapy of Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting TCTP as a new therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'TCTP Has a Crucial Role in the Different Stages of Prostate Cancer Malignant Progression.', 'Lipid-modified oligonucleotide conjugates: Insights into gene silencing, interaction with model membranes and cellular uptake mechanisms.', 'Antisense oligonucleotides: target validation and development of systemically delivered therapeutic nanoparticles.', 'ZNF703 mRNA-Targeting Antisense Oligonucleotide Blocks Cell Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis in Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'FXYD2 antisense oligonucleotide provides an efficient approach for long-lasting relief of chronic peripheral pain.', 'Post-transcriptional modification of m6A methylase METTL3 regulates ERK-induced androgen-deprived treatment resistance prostate cancer.', 'The Caenorhabditis elegans anchor cell transcriptome: ribosome biogenesis drives cell invasion through basement membrane.', 'Recent advances in the molecular targeted drugs for prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   In total, 775,999 patients who had PCa in all stages and received treatment with different strategies (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, observation, androgen-deprivation therapy, multimodal treatment, and chemotherapy) were drawn from the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 through 2012. Independent predictors of travel distance (intermediate [12.5-49.9 miles] and long [49.9-249.9 miles] vs short[<12.5 miles]) and its effect on OM were calculated using multivariable regression analyses. Additional analyses evaluated the distance effect on OM in selected subgroups.  Results:   In total, 54.5%, 33.4%, and 12.1% of patients traveled short, intermediate, and long distances, respectively. Residency in rural areas and the receipt of treatment at academic/high-volume centers independently predicted long travel distance. Non-Hispanic black men and Medicaid-insured men were less likely to travel long distances (all P < .001). Overall, traveling a long distance (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.92; P < .001) was associated with lower OM risk compared with traveling a short distance. This held true among non-Hispanic white men; privately insured and Medicare-insured men; those who underwent radical prostatectomy, received radiation therapy, and received multimodal strategies; and those who received treatment at academic/high-volume centers (P < .01), but not among non-Hispanic black men (P = .3). Long travel distance was associated with an increased OM in Medicaid-insured patients (P < .001).  Conclusions:   An OM benefit was observed among men who traveled long distances for PCa treatment, which is likely to be a reflection of centralization of care and more favorable patient-level characteristics in those travelers. Furthermore, the survival benefit mediated by long travel distances appears to be influenced by baseline socioeconomic, treatment, and facility-level factors.

This study has measured out-of-field absorbed organ doses from intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) radiotherapy for esophageal cancer in a Chinese hospital and evaluated the risks of secondary cancer. The dose measurements were based on the thermo-luminescence dosemeter (TLD) and the ATOM® phantom, which represents an adult male. Over 100 TLD chips were placed in 35 different organ sites and one group of the same TLDs was set as background contrast. All TLDs were calibrated against the same Linac accelerator performing an IMRT plan for esophageal cancer. The measured doses were used to calculate the secondary cancer risks according to biological effects of ionizing radiation (BEIR) VII methodology. The baseline risks and survival data were based on relevant statistics for the Chinese population. It is found that the out-of-field organ doses depended greatly on the distance between organ sites and the target isocenter. The organ doses decreased exponentially as the distance from the target isocenter increased, and, for distances <15 cm, the organ doses fell off more rapidly and almost decreased by 99.55%. When compared with the calculation results by the Pinnacle treatment planning system (TPS), most of the out-of-field organ doses were underestimated in the TPS and the percentage of underestimation reached 100% for distant organs such as the bladder, prostate and testis. These trends are due to a known fact that out-of-field organs received secondary radiation resulted from patients and collimator scattering as well as leakage in the gantry head. The higher lifetime attribute risks (LARs) per 100 000 population were in the lower esophagus (186) and lungs (93.2) near the target. But all LARs of considered organs were found to be less than the baseline cancer risks. Results in this article can help to provide a database about the effect of radiotherapy-induced secondary cancer incidence during esophageal cancer treatment in China.""","""['Yaping Qi', 'Lijuan He', 'Zhi Wang', 'Yuanyuan Liu', 'Hongdong Liu', 'Wanli Huo', 'X George Xu', 'Zhi Chen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Radiat Prot Dosimetry""","""['Secondary cancer-incidence risk estimates for external radiotherapy and high-dose-rate brachytherapy in cervical cancer: phantom study.', 'Radiation-induced cancers from modern radiotherapy techniques: intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus proton therapy.', 'OUT-OF-FIELD DOSE MEASUREMENTS FOR 3D CONFORMAL AND INTENSITY MODULATED RADIOTHERAPY OF A PAEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMOUR.', 'Out-of-field organ doses and associated risk of cancer development following radiation therapy with photons.', 'IMRT combined to IGRT: increase of the irradiated volume.

This study explored the advantages of using a real-time-image gating technique, with a focus on prostate cancer. Two patient-positioning methods using fiducial markers were compared: (i) patient positioning only before beam delivery, and (ii) patient positioning both before and during beam delivery using a real-time-gating technique. For each scenario, dose distributions were simulated using the CT images of nine prostate cancer patients. Treatment plans were generated using a single-field proton beam with 3-mm and 6-mm lateral margins. During beam delivery, the prostate was assumed to move by 5 mm in four directions that were perpendicular to the beam direction at one of three separate timings (i.e. after the completion of the first, second and third quartiles of the total delivery of spot irradiation). Using a 3-mm margin and second quartile motion timing, the averaged values for ΔD99, ΔD95, ΔD5 and D5-95 were 5.1%, 3.3%, 3.6% and 9.0%, respectively, for Scenario (i) and 2.1%, 1.5%, 0.5% and 4.1%, respectively, for Scenario (ii). The margin expansion from 3 mm to 6 mm reduced the size of ΔD99, ΔD95, ΔD5 and D5-95 only with Scenario (i). These results indicate that patient positioning during beam delivery is an effective way to obtain better target coverage and uniformity while reducing the target margin when the prostate moves during irradiation.""","""['Yusuke Fujii', 'Taeko Matsuura', 'Seishin Takao', 'Yuka Matsuzaki', 'Takaaki Fujii', 'Naoki Miyamoto', 'Kikuo Umegaki', 'Kentaro Nishioka', 'Shinichi Shimizu', 'Hiroki Shirato']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Analysis of treatment process time for real-time-image gated-spot-scanning proton-beam therapy (RGPT) system.', 'Effect of intrafraction prostate motion on proton pencil beam scanning delivery: a quantitative assessment.', 'Integration of a real-time tumor monitoring system into gated proton spot-scanning beam therapy: an initial phantom study using patient tumor trajectory data.', 'Particle therapy of moving targets-the strategies for tumour motion monitoring and moving targets irradiation.', 'Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Challenges and Opportunities.', 'Validation of dose distribution for liver tumors treated with real-time-image gated spot-scanning proton therapy by log data based dose reconstruction.', 'On-line range verification for proton beam therapy using spherical ionoacoustic waves with resonant frequency.', 'Dynamic gating window technique for the reduction of dosimetric error in respiratory-gated spot-scanning particle therapy: An initial phantom study using patient tumor trajectory data.', 'A novel range-verification method using ionoacoustic wave generated from spherical gold markers for particle-beam therapy: a simulation study.', 'A Literature Review of Proton Beam Therapy for Prostate Cancer in Japan.']"""

The extent of MB binding to PSMA positive cells for two different targeting strategies was determined using an in vitro flow chamber. The initial approach involved pretargeting, where TCO-anti-PSMA was first incubated with PSMA expressing cells and followed by MBTz, which subsequently showed a 2.8 fold increase in the number of bound MBs compared to experiments performed in the absence of TCO-anti-PSMA. Using direct targeting, where TCO-anti-PSMA was linked to MBTz prior to initiation of the assay, a 5-fold increase in binding compared to controls was observed. The direct targeting approach was subsequently evaluated in vivo using a human xenograft tumor model and two different PSMA-targeting antibodies. The US signal enhancements observed were 1.6- and 5.9-fold greater than that for non-targeted MBs. The lead construct was also evaluated in a head-to-head study using mice bearing both PSMA positive or negative tumors in separate limbs. The human PSMA expressing tumors exhibited a 2-fold higher US signal compared to those tumors deficient in human PSMA.

Approximately one third of survivors report high FCR. This study aimed to evaluate whether blended cognitive behavior therapy (bCBT) can reduce the severity of FCR in cancer survivors curatively treated for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer. Patients and Methods This randomized controlled trial included 88 cancer survivors with high FCR (Cancer Worry Scale score ≥ 14) from 6 months to 5 years after cancer treatment. Participants were randomly allocated (ratio 1:1, stratified by cancer type) to receive bCBT, including five face-to face and three online sessions (n = 45) or care as usual (CAU; n = 43). Participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0) and 3 months later (T1). The intervention group completed bCBT between T0 and T1. The primary outcome was FCR severity assessed with the Cancer Worry Scale. Secondary outcomes included other distress-related measures. Statistical (one-way between-group analyses of covariance) and clinical effects (clinically significant improvement) were analyzed by intention to treat. Results Participants who received bCBT reported significantly less FCR than those who received CAU (mean difference, -3.48; 95% CI, -4.69 to -2.28; P < .001) with a moderate-to-large effect size ( d = 0.76). Clinically significant improvement in FCR was significantly higher in the bCBT group than in the CAU group (13 [29%] of 45 compared with 0 [0%] of 43; P < .001); self-rated improvement was also higher in the bCBT group (30 [71%] of 42 compared with 12 [32%] of 38 in the CAU group; P < .001).

Here we identified proteases putatively involved in PCa specific protein cleavage, and examined gene expression and tissue protein levels, jointly with cell localization in normal prostate (nP), benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), seminal vesicles and PCa using qPCR, Western blotting and confocal laser scanning microscopy. We found differential gene expression of chymase (CMA1), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP3, MMP7), and upregulation of MMP14 and tissue inhibitors (TIMP1 and TIMP2) in BPH. In contrast tissue protein levels of MMP14 were downregulated in PCa. MMP3/TIMP1 and MMP7/TIMP1 ratios were decreased in BPH. In seminal vesicles, we found low-level expression of most proteases and, interestingly, we also detected TIMP1 and low levels of TIMP2. We conclude that MMP3 and MMP7 activity is different in PCa compared to BPH due to fine regulation by their inhibitor TIMP1.

To be widely useful, risk tools require multiple external validations. We aimed to validate the CAPRA-S score in an Australian multi-institutional population, including private and public settings and reflecting community practice.  Methods:   The study population were all men on the South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative Database with localized prostate cancer diagnosed during 1998-2013, who underwent radical prostatectomy without adjuvant therapy (n = 1664). Predictive performance was assessed via Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional regression analyses, Harrell's Concordance index, calibration plots and decision curve analysis.  Results:   Biochemical recurrence occurred in 342 (21%) cases. Five-year recurrence-free probabilities for CAPRA-S scores indicating low (0-2), intermediate (3-5) and high risk were 95, 79 and 46%, respectively. The hazard ratio for CAPRA-S score increments was 1.56 (95% confidence interval 1.49-1.64). The Concordance index for 5-year recurrence-free survival was 0.77. The calibration plot showed good correlation between predicted and observed recurrence-free survival across scores. Limitations include the retrospective nature and small numbers with higher CAPRA-S scores.  Conclusions:   The CAPRA-S score is an accurate predictor of recurrence after radical prostatectomy in our cohort, supporting its utility in the Australian setting. This simple tool can assist in post-surgical selection of patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy while avoiding morbidity among those less likely to benefit.""","""['Kerri Beckmann', ""Michael O'Callaghan"", 'Andrew Vincent', 'David Roder', 'Jeremy Millar', 'Sue Evans', 'John McNeil', 'Kim Moretti']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""ANZ J Surg""","""['Multi-institutional validation of the CAPRA-S score to predict disease recurrence and mortality after radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparative analysis of three risk assessment tools in Australian patients with prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy by cancer of the prostate risk assessment post-surgical (CAPRA-S) score.', 'Prognostic value of the CAPRA clinical prediction rule: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Biochemical recurrence after definitive prostate cancer therapy.

Methods:   The linac couch was used as a motion stage to simulate 40 highly dynamic real patient prostate trajectories. For each trajectory, 40 s pretreatment and 120 s treatment periods were extracted to represent a typical treatment fraction. Motion was monitored via continuous stereoscopic x-ray imaging of a single gold fiducial and images were retrospectively divided into periods of stereoscopic and monoscopic imaging to simulate periodic blocking of the room-mounted system by the gantry during arc-based therapy. The accuracy of the combined motion monitoring was assessed by comparison with the linac couch log files. To estimate 3-D marker position during monoscopic imaging, the use of population statistics was compared to both maximum likelihood estimation and stereoscopic localization based estimation of individualized prostate probability density functions (PDFs) from the pretreatment period. The inclusion of intrafraction updating was compared to pretreatment initialization alone.  Results:   Combined mono/stereoscopic localization was successfully implemented. During the transitions from stereoscopic to monoscopic imaging, fiducial localization exhibits sharp discontinuities when population PDFs were employed. Patient specific PDFs successfully reduced the localization error when estimated from stereoscopic localizations, whereas maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was too unstable in the room-mounted geometry. Intrafraction stereoscopic updating provided further increases in accuracy. Residual error tended to decrease throughout the treatment fraction, as the patient-specific PDFs became more refined.  Conclusions:   This is the first demonstration of toggled monoscopic/stereoscopic localization using room-mounted dual x-ray imagers, enabling continuous intrafraction motion monitoring for these systems. We showed that both pretreatment individualization and intrafraction updating should be used to provide the most accurate motion monitoring.""","""['M Tynan R Stevens', 'Dave D Parsons', 'James L Robar']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Continuous monitoring of prostate position using stereoscopic and monoscopic kV image guidance.', 'Three-dimensional prostate position estimation with a single x-ray imager utilizing the spatial probability density.', 'A monoscopic method for real-time tumour tracking using combined occasional x-ray imaging and continuous respiratory monitoring.', 'Three-dimensional, time-resolved, intrafraction motion monitoring throughout stereotactic liver radiation therapy on a conventional linear accelerator.', 'Optimizing monoscopic kV fluoro acquisition for prostate intrafraction motion evaluation.']"""

In prostate cancer (PCa), the role of Glo2 has been scarcely investigated and there are no studies addressing a causative involvement of this protein in this neoplasia. Here, we examined the immunohistochemical profile of Glo2 in human PCa and benign adjacent tissues and investigated Glo2 involvement in PCa development in human prostate cell lines. PCa and matched adjacent normal tissues were obtained from paraffin sections of primary PCa from 20 patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy. Histopathological diagnosis was confirmed for each sample. Glo2 expression analysis was performed by immunohistochemistry in prostate tissues, and by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting in prostate cell lines. The causative and mechanistic role of Glo2 in prostate tumorigenesis was demonstrated by Glo2 ectopic expression/silencing and employing specific activators/inhibitors. Our results showed that Glo2 was selectively expressed in PCa but not in the luminal compartment of the adjacent benign epithelium consistently in all the examined 20 cases. Glo2 expression in PCa was dependent on androgen receptor (AR) and was aimed at stimulating cell proliferation and eluding apoptosis through a mechanism involving the p53-p21 axis. Glo2 was intensely expressed in the basal cells of benign glands but was not involved in PCa genesis. Our results demonstrate for the first time that Glo2 drives prostate tumorigenesis and suggest that it may represent a novel adjuvant marker in the pathological diagnosis of early PCa.""","""['Cinzia Antognelli', 'Ivana Ferri', 'Guido Bellezza', 'Paola Siccu', 'Harold D Love', 'Vincenzo N Talesa', 'Angelo Sidoni']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Glyoxalase 2 Is Involved in Human Prostate Cancer Progression as Part of a Mechanism Driven By PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling With Involvement of PKM2 and ERα.', 'A novel androgen-reduced prostate-specific lncRNA, PSLNR, inhibits prostate-cancer progression in part by regulating the p53-dependent pathway.', 'Glyoxalases in Urological Malignancies.', 'Androgen receptor primes prostate cancer cells to apoptosis through down-regulation of basal p21 expression.', 'Progesterone receptor in the prostate: A potential suppressor for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Glutathione-Related Enzymes and Proteins: A Review.', 'Understanding the Contribution of Lactate Metabolism in Cancer Progress: A Perspective from Isomers.', 'Glyoxalase 2: Towards a Broader View of the Second Player of the Glyoxalase System.', 'The Human Glyoxalase Gene Family in Health and Disease.', 'The Glyoxalase System Is a Novel Cargo of Amniotic Fluid Stem-Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles.']"""

Whereas adjuvant or extremely early SRT irrespective of PSA progression might be overtreatment for some patients, SRT at PSA >0.2 ng/ml might be undertreatment for others. The current study addresses the optimal timing of radiation therapy after RP.  Patients and methods:   Cohort 1 comprised 293 men with PSA 0.1-0.19 ng/ml after RP. Cohort 2 comprised 198 men with SRT. PSA progression and metastases were assessed in cohort 1. In cohort 2, we compared freedom from progression according to pre-SRT PSA (0.03-0.19 vs. 0.2-0.499 ng/ml). Multivariable Cox regression analyses predicted progression after SRT.  Results:   In cohort 1, 281 (95.9%) men had further PSA progression ≥0.2 ng/ml and 27 (9.2%) men developed metastases within a median follow-up of 74.3 months. In cohort 2, we recorded improved freedom from progression according to lower pre-SRT PSA (0.03-0.19 vs. 0.2-0.499 ng/ml: 69 vs. 53%; log-rank p = 0.051). Patients with higher pre-SRT PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml were at a higher risk of progression after SRT (hazard ratio: 1.8; p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   The vast majority of patients with PSA ≥0.1 ng/ml after RP will progress to PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml. Additionally, early administration of SRT at post-RP PSA level <0.2 ng/ml might improve freedom from progression.

Methods:   Data from a consecutive group of 542 patients from January 2012 to January 2017 were retrospectively analysed. As preinterventional prophylaxis patient group A (179) received 500 mg CIP twice a day for three days, beginning on the day before the biopsy (until June 2013); group B (363) received a single dose of ERT 60 min prior to intervention. The first follow-up examination for all patients was between post-intervention days 2 and 3. The second follow-up examination was between day 15 and 30 following biopsy. Urine was cultured in all cases and any adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to the antibiotic treatment were noted. We also recorded all clinically relevant morbidities requiring intervention (ischuria, macrohaematuria, symptomatic urinary tract infections and urosepsis), as well as those not requiring active intervention (macrohaematuria, decreased urinary stream, pain, haemospermia). The main study criterion was the symptomatic urinary tract infection rate and ADRs.  Results:   All 542 biopsied patients could be included in the study and the drop-out rate was zero. There were no significant differences between groups A and B with regards to complications not requiring intervention. There was, however, a significant reduction from 14.5% (group A) to 0.8% (group B) in infectious complications. This showed a significant correlation in favour of ERT (p < 0.001).

Developing computational models to predict potential miRNA-disease associations has become a research hotspot for significant reduction of experimental time and cost. Considering the various disadvantages of previous computational models, we proposed a novel computational model based on super-disease and miRNA for potential miRNA-disease association prediction (SDMMDA) to predict potential miRNA-disease associations by integrating known associations, disease semantic similarity, miRNA functional similarity, and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for diseases and miRNAs. SDMMDA could be applied to new diseases without any known associated miRNAs as well as new miRNAs without any known associated diseases. Due to the fact that there are very few known miRNA-disease associations and many associations are 'missing' in the known training dataset, we introduce the concepts of 'super-miRNA' and 'super-disease' to enhance the similarity measures of diseases and miRNAs. These super classes could help in including the missing associations and improving prediction accuracy. As a result, SDMMDA achieved reliable performance with AUCs of 0.9032, 0.8323, and 0.8970 in global leave-one-out cross validation, local leave-one-out cross validation, and 5-fold cross validation, respectively. In addition, esophageal neoplasms, breast neoplasms, and prostate neoplasms were taken as independent case studies, where 46, 43 and 48 out of the top 50 predicted miRNAs were successfully confirmed by recent experimental literature.

However, our previous studies have revealed that DKK3 expression is predominantly observed in head and neck/oral squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC/OSCC). Interestingly, HNSCC/OSCC patients with DKK3 expression showed a high rate of metastasis and poorer survival, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of DKK3 in HNSCC-derived cancer cell lines resulted in reduced cellular migration and invasion. From these data, it was hypothesized that DKK3 might exert an oncogenic function specific to HNSCC. In the present research, the DKK3 overexpression model was established, and its influences were investigated, together with molecular mechanism studies. The DKK3 expression profile in cancer cell lines was investigated, including HNSCC/OSCC, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, prostatic, and lung cancers. DKK3 overexpression was performed in HNSCC-derived cells by transfection of expression plasmid. The effects of DKK3 overexpression were assessed on cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumor growth. The molecular mechanism of DKK3 overexpression was investigated by Western blotting and microarray analysis. DKK3 overexpression significantly elevated cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as increased mRNA expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc. However, reporter assays did not show TCF/LEF activation, suggesting that the increased malignant property of cancer cells was not driven by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Therefore, it is essential to uncover alternative drugs for inhibiting survival pathways in breast cancer cells. Stachydrine hydrochloride, a well-known bioactive ingredients extracted from HerbaLeonuri, has proven to be very efficient for the treatment of various diseases such as prostate cancer. However, whether stachydrine hydrochloride can exert similar prophylactic and therapeutic effects against breast cancer, and the probable underlying molecular mechanism remain unknown. In the present work, the effects of stachydrine hydrochloride on human breast cancer cell lines (T47D and MCF-7) were evaluated. Our results showed that Stachydrine hydrochloride inhibits cell proliferation and induces primary apoptosis and ROS production in T47D and MCF-7 cells in time- and dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Stachydrine hydrochloride treatment induced caspase-3 activation and decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Moreimportantly, Stachydrine hydrochloride simultaneously inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK proteins. Overall, our data indicated that Stachydrine hydrochloride induces apoptosis in MCF-7 and T47D cells and exerts inhibitory effects on proliferation by concurrently suppressing Akt and ERK survival signals, suggesting its potential efficiency in treatment of breast cancer.""","""['Ming Wang', 'Zhi-Jun Shu', 'Ying Wang', 'Wei Peng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Am J Transl Res""","""['Stachydrine suppresses viability & migration of astrocytoma cells via CXCR4/ERK & CXCR4/Akt pathway activity.', 'Stachydrine hydrochloride alleviates pressure overload-induced heart failure and calcium mishandling on mice.', 'Roles of the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathways in malignant transformation and drug resistance.', 'Effect of sodium aescinate in inducing human breast cancer MCF-7 cells apoptosis by inhibiting AKT, ERK and upstream signal SRC activity.', 'The Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg paradigm induced by stachydrine hydrochloride reduces uterine bleeding in RU486-induced abortion mice.', 'Pasture-finishing of bison improves animal metabolic health and potential health-promoting compounds in meat.', 'Metabolites Profiling and In Vitro Biological Characterization of Different Fractions of Cliona sp.

AR antagonists such as enzalutamide and seviteronel have shown success in preclinical models and clinical trials of prostate cancer and are currently being evaluated in breast cancer. Reciprocal regulation between AR and the HER2/PI3K/mTOR pathway may contribute to resistance to HER2- and mTOR-targeted therapies; thus, dual inhibition of these pathways may synergistically inhibit breast cancer growth. HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer cell lines were treated with AR antagonist plus anti-HER2 mAb trastuzumab or mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Apoptosis, cell proliferation, and drug synergy were measured in vitro Pathway component genes and proteins were measured by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and reverse phase protein array. In vivo, HER2+ breast cancer xenografts were treated with enzalutamide, everolimus, trastuzumab, and combinations of these drugs. AR antagonists inhibited proliferation of both HER2+ and TNBC cell lines. Combining AR antagonist and either everolimus or trastuzumab resulted in synergistic inhibition of proliferation. Dihydrotestosterone caused increased phosphorylation of HER2 and/or HER3 that was attenuated by AR inhibition. Everolimus caused an increase in total AR, phosphorylation of HER2 and/or HER3, and these effects were abrogated by enzalutamide. Growth of trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ xenograft tumors was inhibited by enzalutamide, and combining enzalutamide with everolimus decreased tumor viability more than either single agent.

Conventional biomarkers of PC still lack precision in identifying individuals at high risk of PC recurrence. While many candidate biomarkers are proposed in the literature, few are in clinical practice as they lack rigorous validation. This study prospectively enrolled an independent phase III cohort to evaluate the clinical utility of zinc-alpha 2-glycoprotein (AZGP1) as a prognostic biomarker in localized PC.  Patients and methods:   In our multicentre, prospective phase III study, AZGP1 status in 347 radical prostatectomy specimens was assayed by immunohistochemistry in a NATA-accredited laboratory. The AZGP1 score was assessed in a multivariable model incorporating established prognostic factors. We also report extended outcomes from our previous phase II study. The primary endpoint was biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS). Secondary endpoints were metastasis-free survival (MFS) and PC-specific survival (PCSS).  Results:   In the phase II cohort, with a median follow-up of 15.8 years, low/absent AZGP1 expression was an independent predictor of poor BRFS (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9; P = 0.03), MFS (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-6.6; P = 0.02) and PCSS (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.5-9.5; P = 0.005). These results were validated in our prospective phase III cohort. Low/absent AZGP1 expression independently predicted for BRFS (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.3; P = 0.02), with shorter MFS (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4; P = 0.02). AZGP1 improved the discriminatory value when incorporated into existing prognostic risk models.

Our aim was to evaluate the association between protein expression levels of GATA2 in primary prostate cancer tumour samples and the risk of BCR after SRT.  Methods:   109 males who were treated with SRT were included. The percentage of cells with nuclear staining and GATA2 staining intensity were both measured. These two measures were multiplied together to obtain a GATA2 H-score (range 0-12) which was our primary GATA2 staining measure.  Results:   In unadjusted analysis, the risk of BCR was higher for patients with a GATA2 H-score >4 (hazard ratio = 2.04, p = 0.033). In multivariable analysis adjusting for SRT dose, pre-SRT PSA, pathological tumour stage and Gleason score, this association weakened substantially (hazard ratio = 1.45, p = 0.31). This lack of an independent association with BCR appears to be the result of correlations between GATA2 H-score >4 and higher pre-SRT PSA (p = 0.021), higher Gleason score (p = 0.044) and more severe pathological tumour stage (p = 0.068).  Conclusion:   Higher levels of GATA2 expression appear to be a marker of prostate cancer severity; however, these do not provide independent prognostic information regarding BCR beyond that of validated clinicopathological risk factors.

Materials and methods:   A lifetime Markov model was developed to compare the effects of denosumab and zoledronic acid on costs (including drug costs and administration, patient management, SREs, and adverse events), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from a national payer perspective. Different discount rates, time horizons, SRE rates, distributions, and nature (asymptomatic vs all SREs), and the inclusion of treatment discontinuation were considered in scenario analyses. The robustness of the model was tested using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.  Results:   Across tumor types, denosumab was associated with fewer SREs, improved QALYs, and higher total costs over a lifetime. The incremental cost per QALY gained for denosumab vs zoledronic acid was 382,673 CZK for prostate cancer, 408,450 CZK for breast cancer, and 608,133 CZK for OST. Incremental costs per SRE avoided for the same tumor type were 54,007 CZK, 51,765 CZK, and 94,426 CZK, respectively. In scenario analyses, the results remained similar to baseline, when different discount rates and time horizons were considered. At a non-official willingness-to-pay threshold of 1.2 million CZK, the probabilities of denosumab being cost-effective vs zoledronic acid were 0.64, 0.67, and 0.49 for prostate cancer, breast cancer, and OST, respectively.

These observations underscore the need for deciphering the underlying mechanism of DX resistance to enable the development of effective therapeutic approaches. We observed up regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein c-FLIP and its up stream regulators including receptor tyrosine kinase RON and transcription factor NFκB (p65) in tumors obtained from metastatic prostate cancer patients. We also observed significant downregulation of these molecules in prostate tumors isolated from patients treated with DX as first line therapy. Further, we identified the over the counter anti-inflammatory agent, Nexrutine (NX) suppresses c-FLIP protein levels, and expression in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (PC-3). Remarkably, the observed decreased levels of c-FLIP were further reduced in combination with DX. Transient expression assays coupled with electrophoretic mobility shift and DNA affinity protein assay revealed that NX and DX suppresses c-FLIP promoter activity by preventing p65 binding. Notably, NX in combination with DX abolished binding of p65 to the c-FLIP promoter sequence containing NFκB binding sites. Biologically, these alterations resulted in reduced growth of PC-3 cells. Taken together, these observations suggest the utility of RON, p65, and c-FLIP as potential markers to predict response to DX treatment. Furthermore, our results also identified NX as an agent to potentiate the therapeutic response of DX by suppressing activation of c-FLIP and its upstream regulators.""","""['Yangang Zhang', 'Li Li', 'Jingyu Wang', 'Wei Cheng', 'Jiandong Zhang', 'Xueting Li', 'Zhenhua Zhang', 'Jingjing Gong', 'Rita Ghosh', 'Addanki P Kumar', 'Jianping Xie']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Activation of AKR1C1/ERβ induces apoptosis by downregulation of c-FLIP in prostate cancer cells: A prospective therapeutic opportunity.', 'Palmatine inhibits growth and invasion in prostate cancer cell: Potential role for rpS6/NFκB/FLIP.', 'Anti-cancer efficacy of SREBP inhibitor, alone or in combination with docetaxel, in prostate cancer harboring p53 mutations.', 'NFkappaB-dependent chemoresistance in solid tumors.', 'Endocrinotherapy resistance of prostate and breast cancer: Importance of the NF‑κB pathway (Review).', 'Dietary Compounds for Targeting Prostate Cancer.']"""

Transperineal mapping biopsies mitigate these problems but carry increased cost and patient burden. Local anaesthetic, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted transperineal biopsy may offer an alternative. Here, we aim to determine the feasibility, tolerability and detection rates of clinically significant prostate cancer using a local anaesthetic, transperineal, MRI-targeted biopsy technique.  Methods:   Tertiary referral centre in which 181 consecutive men underwent local anaesthetic, transperineal MRI-targeted prostate biopsy (September 2014 to January 2016). A standardized local anaesthetic technique was used to obtain targeted biopsies using visual estimation with the number of targeted cores determined by each of a number of users. We assessed adverse events, patient visual analogue pain scores and detection rates of clinically significant cancer (defined by University College London (UCL) definitions one and two and separately by the presence of dominant and non-dominant Gleason pattern 4). We secondarily assessed detection of any cancer, rates of detection by MRI (Likert) score and by presenting PSA. Differences were assessed using Chi-squared tests (P<0.05).  Results:   One hundred eighty-one men with 243 lesions were included. There were no episodes of sepsis or re-admissions and one procedure was abandoned owing to patient discomfort. Twenty-three out of 25 (92%) men would recommend the procedure to another. Median visual analogue pain score was 1.0 (interquartile range: 0.0-2.4). A total 104/181 (57%) had UCL definition 1 disease (Gleason ⩾4+3 and/or maximum cancer length ⩾6 mm) and 129/181 (71%) had UCL definition 2 cancer (Gleason ⩾3+4 and/or maximum cancer length ⩾4 mm). Fifty-four out of 181 (30%) and 124/181 (69%) had dominant and non-dominant pattern 4 disease or greater (irrespective of cancer length). Any cancer was detected in 142/181 (78%). Significant disease was more likely in higher MRI-scoring lesions and in men with PSAs ⩾10 ng ml-1.

The majority of them included mainly low and intermediate risk prostate cancer (PCa) without specifically assessing PCa-related death (PCRD). Thus, there is a lack of knowledge regarding a possible effect of NHT on PCRD in the high-risk PCa population. We aimed to analyze the effect of NHT on PCRD in a multicenter high-risk PCa population treated with RP, using a propensity-score adjustment.  Methods:   This is a retrospective multi-institutional study including patients with high-risk PCa defined as: clinical stage T3-4, PSA >20 ng ml-1 or biopsy Gleason score 8-10. We compared PCRD between RP and NHT+RP using competing risks analysis. Correction for group differences was performed by propensity-score adjustment.  Results:   After application of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 1573 patients remained for analysis; 1170 patients received RP and 403 NHT+RP. Median follow-up was 56 months (interquartile range 29-88). Eighty-six patients died of PCa and 106 of other causes. NHT decreased the risk of PCRD (hazard ratio (HR) 0.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.80; P=0.0014). An interaction effect between NHT and radiotherapy (RT) was observed (HR 0.3; 95% CI 0.21-0.43; P<0.0008). More specifically, of patients who received adjuvant RT, those who underwent NHT+RP had decreased PCRD rates (2.3% at 5 year) compared to RP (7.5% at 5 year). The retrospective design and lack of specific information about NHT are possible limitations.  Conclusions:   In this propensity-score adjusted analysis from a large high-risk PCa population, NHT before surgery significantly decreased PCRD. This effect appeared to be mainly driven by the early addition of RT post-surgery.

All the histopathological (HPE) reports of all prostate specimens were collected from 23 medical colleges, private institutions and stand-.alone HPE laboratories in PMR.  Materials and methods:   Four types of prostate specimens were examined - endoscopic resection, open prostatectomy, transrectal needle biopsy of prostate and prostate from the cystoprostatectomy specimen (surgery carried out for primary carcinoma bladder). Specimens of radical prostatectomy were excluded as the biopsy was carried out earlier.  Results:   A total of 5006 reports of the prostate specimens were examined out of which 779 showed the presence of CAP. Analysis of annual occurrence of CAP revealed that there was no significant variation in the CAP cases. Thus giving an average of CAP cases of 155.8 per year in PMR. Population data of the PMR was obtained from the official Government of India Census department for the year 2011. Total population of PMR in 2011 was 5,049,968 out of which the male population was 2,659,484. Thus the occurrence of CAP in the PMR works out to 5.86/100,000 male population. Results were compared with the published reports of CAP by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) of 7.2/100,000 and Globocon of 4.2/100,000 males.

Unfortunately, over time patients invariably develop resistance to docetaxel therapy and their disease will continue to progress. The mechanisms by which resistance develops are still incompletely understood. This study seeks to determine the involvement of miRNAs, specifically miR-181a, in docetaxel resistance in CRPC.  Methods:   Real-time PCR was used to measure miR-181a expression in parental and docetaxel resistant C4-2B and DU145 cells (TaxR and DU145-DTXR). miR-181a expression was modulated in parental or docetaxel resistant cells by transfecting them with miR-181a mimics or antisense, respectively. Following transfection, cell number was determined after 48 h with or without docetaxel. Cross resistance to cabazitaxel induced by miR-181a was also determined. Western blots were used to determine ABCB1 protein expression and rhodamine assays used to assess activity. Phospho-p53 expression was assessed by Western blot and apoptosis was measured by ELISA in C4-2B TaxR and PC3 cells with inhibited or overexpressed miR-181a expression with or without docetaxel.  Results:   miR-181a is significantly overexpressed in TaxR and DU145-DTXR cells compared to parental cells. Overexpression of miR-181a in parental cells confers docetaxel and cabazitaxel resistance and knockdown of miR-181a in TaxR cells re-sensitizes them to treatment with both docetaxel and cabazitaxel. miR-181a was not observed to impact ABCB1 expression or activity, a protein which was previously demonstrated to be highly involved in docetaxel resistance. Knockdown of miR-181a in TaxR cells induced phospho-p53 expression. Furthermore, miR-181a knockdown alone induced apoptosis in TaxR cells which could be further enhanced by the addition of DTX.  Conclusions:   Overexpression of mir-181a in prostate cancer cells contributes to their resistance to docetaxel and cabazitaxel and inhibition of mir-181a expression can restore treatment response. This is due, in part, to modulation of p53 phosphorylation and apoptosis.""","""['Cameron M Armstrong', 'Chengfei Liu', 'Wei Lou', 'Alan P Lombard', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Activation of the ABCB1 Amplicon in Docetaxel- and Cabazitaxel-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Inhibition of ABCB1 expression overcomes acquired docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs as potential therapeutics to enhance chemosensitivity in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: changing landscape with cabazitaxel.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Functions, mechanisms, and clinical applications of lncRNA LINC00857 in cancer pathogenesis.', 'The Emerging Role of Epigenetics in Metabolism and Endocrinology.', 'MicroRNAs as clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in prostate cancer.', 'microRNA-181a silencing by antisense oligonucleotides delivered by virus-like particles.', 'MicroRNA as a Potential Therapeutic Molecule in Cancer.']"""

Previous literature on validation of surrogate endpoints are classified into four approaches: the proportion explained approach; the indirect effects approach; the meta-analytic approach; and the principal stratification approach. The mainstream in cancer research has seen the application of a meta-analytic approach. However, VanderWeele (2013) showed that all four of these approaches potentially suffer from the surrogate paradox. It was also shown that, if a principal surrogate satisfies additional criteria called one-sided average causal sufficiency, the surrogate cannot exhibit a surrogate paradox. Here, we propose a method for estimating principal effects under a monotonicity assumption. Specifically, we consider cancer clinical trials which compare a binary surrogate endpoint and a time-to-event clinical endpoint under two naturally ordered treatments (e.g. combined therapy vs. monotherapy). Estimation based on a mean score estimating equation will be implemented by the expectation-maximization algorithm. We will also apply the proposed method as well as other surrogacy criteria to evaluate the surrogacy of prostate-specific antigen using data from a phase III advanced prostate cancer trial, clarifying the complementary roles of both the principal stratification and meta-analytic approaches in the evaluation of surrogate endpoints in cancer.

Methods:   To address this question, we conducted a nested case-control study of RCC (252 cases, 252 controls) within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial investigating associations with pre-diagnostic serum levels of total adiponectin, high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, IGF-1, IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), and C-peptide. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.  Results:   After adjustment for potential confounders, non-significant associations with RCC were observed for total adiponectin (OR for highest vs. lowest quartile = 0.65, 95% CI 0.37-1.14; p trend = 0.35), HMW adiponectin (0.67, 0.38-1.17; p trend = 0.36), IGF-1 (1.35, 0.77-2.39; p trend = 0.17), IGFBP-3 (1.47, 0.83-2.62; p trend = 0.53), and C-peptide (1.52, 0.86-2.70; p trend = 0.15). In a joint analysis with body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), obese individuals (BMI ≥30) with above-median levels of IGFBP-3 had a significantly higher risk versus those with BMI <25 and below-median IGFBP-3 (OR 2.42, 1.11-5.26), whereas obese individuals with low IGFBP-3 did not (1.18, 0.53-2.64) (p interaction = 0.35).

The results of the tests in ADT and non-ADT groups in addition to the demographic data and the features of the malignancy were statistically compared. Of the 106 patients enrolled, 48 (45.3%) were receiving adjuvant ADT and 58 (54.7%) were not. Age, disease duration, and education levels showed no difference between the two groups.

Changes in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were recorded, while pain intensity was evaluated using the self-reporting Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire. Bone scintigraphy (BS) was performed to assess treatment response. Seven patients completed six cycles of Ra-223. Discontinuation was due to leuko- and lymphopenia, progressive lymph node metastasis or newly diagnosed liver metastasis. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in three patients and included leuko- and lymphopenia, fatigue, abdominal discomfort and nausea. Overall, a median decrease of 28% in ALP and a median decrease of 83% in PSA were noted at follow-up. However, PSA progressed in five patients at follow-up. Improvement of pain was observed in all patients (median decrease of 36% after 3 cycles and of 40% at the end of therapy). On BS, three patients showed remission, four had stable disease, and one showed progressive disease at follow-up. Our results suggest that Ra-223 for primary bone metastases in patients with mHSPC after RP is feasible and alleviates pain. ALP, rather than PSA, may be a good marker for assessing treatment response. Ra-223 could therefore be taken into consideration as part of a multimodal approach for carefully selected patients with advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Vera Wenter', 'Annika Herlemann', 'Wolfgang P Fendler', 'Harun Ilhan', 'Natalia Tirichter', 'Peter Bartenstein', 'Christian G Stief', 'Christian la Fougère', 'Nathalie L Albert', 'Axel Rominger', 'Christian Gratzke']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Phase II study of radium-223 dichloride in Japanese patients with symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Changes in prostate-specific antigen, markers of bone metabolism and bone scans after treatment with radium-223.', 'Radium-223 and concomitant therapies in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: an international, early access, open-label, single-arm phase 3b trial.', 'Radium-223 dichloride: a novel treatment option for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'Radium-223 for the treatment of bone metastases in castration-resistant prostate cancer: when and why.', 'Sodium Fluoride-18 and Radium-223 Dichloride Uptake Colocalize in Osteoblastic Mouse Xenograft Tumors.', 'Targeted α-Therapy in Cancer Management: Synopsis of Preclinical and Clinical Studies.', 'Multifaceted Roles for Macrophages in Prostate Cancer Skeletal Metastasis.', 'Radium-223 IN metastatic hormone-sensitive high-grade prostate cancer: initial experience.', 'Radium-223 dichloride in patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer.']"""

During embryonic development, TWIST1 and HOXA9 are coexpressed in mouse prostate and then silenced postnatally. Here we report that TWIST1 and HOXA9 coexpression are reactivated in mouse and human primary prostate tumors and are further enriched in human metastases, correlating with survival. TWIST1 formed a complex with WDR5 and the lncRNA Hottip/HOTTIP, members of the MLL/COMPASS-like H3K4 methylases, which regulate chromatin in the Hox/HOX cluster during development. TWIST1 overexpression led to coenrichment of TWIST1 and WDR5 as well as increased H3K4me3 chromatin at the Hoxa9/HOXA9 promoter, which was dependent on WDR5. Expression of WDR5 and Hottip/HOTTIP was also required for TWIST1-induced upregulation of HOXA9 and aggressive cellular phenotypes such as invasion and migration. Pharmacologic inhibition of HOXA9 prevented TWIST1-induced aggressive prostate cancer cellular phenotypes in vitro and metastasis in vivo This study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which TWIST1 regulates chromatin and gene expression by cooperating with the COMPASS-like complex to increase H3K4 trimethylation at target gene promoters.

We evaluated how frequently men with localized prostate cancer report receiving help from their PCP about their treatment, and whether those men who do are less likely to receive definitive treatment.  Methods:   We mailed surveys to men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2012 and 2014 in the greater Philadelphia region. Participants were asked whether their PCP helped decide how to treat their cancer. The outcome was receipt of definitive treatment (either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy).  Results:   A total of 2386 men responded (adjusted response rate, 51.1%). Among these men, 38.2% reported receiving help from their PCP regarding choosing a treatment, and 79.6% received definitive treatment. In adjusted analyses, non-Hispanic black men (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-2.27) were more likely than non-Hispanic white men to report receiving help from their PCP. However, men who did receive help were not more likely to forgo definitive treatment overall (P = .58) or in the subgroups of men who may be least likely to benefit from definitive treatment.

AR expressed in mesenchyme is necessary and sufficient for prostate development while loss of stromal AR is predictive of prostate cancer progression. Many studies have characterized genome-wide binding of AR in prostate tumour cells but none have used primary mesenchyme or stroma. We applied ChIPseq to identify genomic AR binding sites in primary human fetal prostate fibroblasts and patient derived cancer associated fibroblasts, as well as the WPMY1 cell line overexpressing AR. We identified AR binding sites that were specific to fetal prostate fibroblasts (7534), cancer fibroblasts (629), WPMY1-AR (2561) as well as those common among all (783). Primary fibroblasts had a distinct AR binding profile versus prostate cancer cell lines and tissue, and showed a localisation to gene promoter binding sites 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site, as well as non-classical AR binding sequence motifs. We used RNAseq to define transcribed genes associated with AR binding sites and derived cistromes for embryonic and cancer fibroblasts as well as a cistrome common to both. These were compared to several in vivo ChIPseq and transcript expression datasets; which identified subsets of AR targets that were expressed in vivo and regulated by androgens. This analysis enabled us to deconvolute stromal AR targets active in stroma within tumour samples. Taken together, our data suggest that the AR shows significantly different genomic binding site locations in primary prostate fibroblasts compared to that observed in tumour cells. Validation of our AR binding site data with transcript expression in vitro and in vivo suggests that the AR target genes we have identified in primary fibroblasts may contribute to clinically significant and biologically important AR-regulated changes in prostate tissue.""","""['Claire Nash', 'Nadia Boufaied', 'Ian G Mills', 'Omar E Franco', 'Simon W Hayward', 'Axel A Thomson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['Cell-lineage specificity and role of AP-1 in the prostate fibroblast androgen receptor cistrome.', 'Genome-wide analysis of androgen receptor binding and transcriptomic analysis in mesenchymal subsets during prostate development.', 'Androgen receptor in cancer-associated fibroblasts influences stemness in cancer cells.', 'Chromatin binding by the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Stromal Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Development and Progression.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts: from basic science to anticancer therapy.', 'The Role of Heat Shock Protein 70 Subfamily in the Hyperplastic Prostate: From Molecular Mechanisms to Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Androgen receptor-mediated transcriptional repression targets cell plasticity in prostate cancer.', 'Stroma Transcriptomic and Proteomic Profile of Prostate Cancer Metastasis Xenograft Models Reveals Prognostic Value of Stroma Signatures.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in prostate development and benign prostatic hyperplasia: A review.']"""

Detailed Western blot analysis performed using fatostatin and PF429242 at 72 h time point led to significant decrease in the levels of the active form of SREBP1 and its downstream signaling proteins such as FAS, SCD-1 and HMGCoAR and the mutant form of tumor suppressor protein, p53, levels in comparison to the levels observed in vehicle treated control group of MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cells over the same time period.

PPARα is a key regulator of lipid homeostasis and a negative regulator of inflammation. Under conditions of metabolic stress such as fasting or glucose deprivation, PPARα is upregulated in order to control gene expression necessary for processing alternate fuel sources (e.g. fatty acid oxidation) and thereby promote maintenance of cell viability. Clinically, PPARα expression is upregulated in diseased tissues such as melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ovarian and prostate cancer. This may allow for cellular proliferation and metastasis. Importantly, genetic knockouts of PPARα have been shown to be protected against tumor growth in a variety of syngeneic tumors models. We hypothesized that a potent and selective PPARα antagonist could represent a novel cancer therapy. Early in our discovery research, we identified NXT629 (Bravo et al., 2014). Herein we describe the pharmacology of NXT629 and demonstrate that it is a potent and selective PPARα antagonist. We identify NXT629 as a valuable tool for use in in vivo assessment of PPARα due to its good systemic exposure following intraperitoneal injection. We explore the in vivo pharmacology of NXT629 and demonstrate that it is efficacious in pharmacodynamic models that are driven by PPARα. Finally, we probe the efficacy of NXT629 in disease models where PPARα knockouts have shown to be protected.

Results and limitations:   Compared with 48% in the anterior arm, 71% men undergoing posterior RARP were continent 1 wk after catheter removal (p=0.01); corresponding median 24-h pad weights were 25 and 5g (p=0.001). Median time to continence in posterior versus anterior RARP was 2 and 8 d postcatheter removal, respectively (log-rank p=0.02); results were confirmed on multivariable regression analyses. GEE analyses showed that UF-related bother (but not UF) scores were significantly lower in the posterior versus anterior RARP group at 1 wk, 2 wk, and 1 mo on GEE analyses. Incidence of postoperative complications (12% anterior vs 18% posterior) and probability of BCRFS (0.91 vs 0.91) were comparable in the two arms.  Conclusions:   In this single-center randomized study, the Retzius-sparing approach of RARP resulted in earlier recovery of UC and lower UF-related bother compared with standard RARP. These results require long-term validation and reproduction by other centers, as well as studies on men with high-risk localized disease.

Therefore, its inhibition has become an attractive target to develop new therapies against this disease. Recently, we have developed a highly potent and selective PACE4 inhibitor, known as the multi-Leu peptide with the following sequence Ac-LLLLRVKR-NH2. Herein, with the aim of improving the stability profile of this inhibitor for potential in vivo application, we investigated the impact of different cyclization strategies. The inhibitory activity of new peptides was tested and compared to their linear counterparts. The potent analogues were further selected for stability evaluation. Our results showed that the cyclization involving a C-terminal carboxylic acid (head-to-tail or side chain-to-tail) led to compounds with significantly diminished inhibitory potency towards PACE4, indicating that an appropriate balance between rigidity and flexibility of the structure is necessary to allow the optimal binding with the enzyme. On the other hand, the modification within a multi-Leu core in combination with the incorporation of a C-terminal 4-amidinobenzylamide (Amba) residue yielded potent cyclic analogues. The best compound derived from this group, (&)[Mpa]LLLC(&)RVK[Amba] (where & indicates cyclization, Mpa - 3-mercaptopropionic acid), exhibited promising overall profile comprising of potent inhibitory effect against PACE4 and prostate cancer cell lines as well as improved stability.

We have investigated the association between the risk of biochemical recurrence and lymphovascular invasion in resection margin negative patients, as well as its association with lymph node metastasis.  Methods:   One thousand six hundred thirty four patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2005 to 2014 were selected. Patients with bone or distant organ metastasis at the time of operation were excluded. Survival analysis was performed to assess biochemical recurrence, metastasis and mortality risks by Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression. Odds of lymph node metastasis were evaluated by Logistic regression.  Results:   LVI was detected in 118 (7.4%) patients. The median follow-up duration was 33.1 months. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, lymphovascular invasion was associated with significantly increased 5-year and 10-year BCR rate (60.2% vs. 39.1%, 60.2% vs. 40.1%, respectively; p < 0.001), 10-year bone metastasis rate and cancer specific mortality (16.9% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.001; 6.8% vs. 2.7%, p = 0.034, respectively) compared to patients without LVI. When stratified by T stage and resection margin status, lymphovascular invasion resulted in significantly increased 10-year biochemical recurrence rate in T3 patients both with and without positive surgical margin (p = 0.008, 0.005, respectively). In the multivariate Cox regression model lymphovascular invasion resulted in 1.4-fold BCR risk and 1.7-fold metastasis risk increase (95% CI 1.045-1.749, 1.024-2.950; p = 0.022, 0.040, respectively). Lymphovascular invasion was revealed to be strongly associated with lymph node metastasis in the multivariate Logistic regression (OR 4.317, 95% CI 2.092-8.910, p < 0.001).

This study investigated the primary coping mechanisms for men following the active surveillance treatment plan, with a specific focus on how these men interact with their social network as they negotiate the stress and uncertainty of their diagnosis and treatment approach.  Methods:   Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews at two academic institutions located in the northeastern US. Participants include 15 men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer following active surveillance.  Results:   The decision to follow active surveillance reflects the desire to avoid potentially life-altering side effects associated with active treatment options. Men on active surveillance cope with their prostate cancer diagnosis by both maintaining a sense of control over their daily lives, as well as relying on the support provided them by their social networks and the medical community. Social networks support men on active surveillance by encouraging lifestyle changes and serving as a resource to discuss and ease cancer-related stress.  Conclusions:   Support systems for men with low-risk prostate cancer do not always interface directly with the medical community.

The purpose of this planning tool is to highlight sub-optimal clinical plans and to improve plan quality and consistency.  Methods:   A historical cohort of 97 VMAT prostate plans was interrogated using a RayStation script and used to develop a local model for predicting optimum average rectum dose based on individual anatomy. A preliminary validation study was performed whereby historical plans identified as ""optimal"" and ""sub-optimal"" by the local model were replanned in a blinded study by four experienced planners and compared to the original clinical plan to assess whether any improvement in rectum dose was observed. The predictive model was then incorporated into a RayStation script and used as part of the clinical planning process. Planners were asked to use the script during planning to provide a patient specific prediction for optimum average rectum dose and to optimise the plan accordingly.  Results:   Plans identified as ""sub-optimal"" in the validation study observed a statistically significant improvement in average rectum dose compared to the clinical plan when replanned whereas plans that were identified as ""optimal"" observed no improvement when replanned. This provided confidence that the local model can identify plans that were suboptimal in terms of rectal sparing. Clinical implementation of the knowledge based planning tool reduced the population-averaged mean rectum dose by 5.6Gy. There was a small but statistically significant increase in total MU and femoral head dose and a reduction in conformity index. These did not affect the clinical acceptability of the plans and no significant changes to other plan quality metrics were observed.  Conclusions:   The knowledge-based planning tool has enabled substantial reductions in population-averaged mean rectum dose for prostate VMAT patients.

Summary answer:   The endocrine function of human testes explants [assessed by measuring testosterone and insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3)] was impacted by exposure of the human adult testis explants to BPA/BPA-A.  What is known already:   The few epidemiologic studies performed suggest that bisphenols have potential endocrine disruptive properties, but they did not identify clear and direct patterns of endocrine disruption.  Study design, size, duration:   Adult human testis explants in culture were exposed to BPA and the analogs bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol E (BPE), bisphenol B (BPB) and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) at 10-9-10-5 M for 24 or 48 h.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   Human adult testes were obtained from prostate cancer patients who had no hormone therapy, or from multiorgan donors. After ex vivo exposure to the investigated bisphenols, the measured outcomes were related to histopathology (gross morphology and germ cell viability determined by anti-caspase three immunohistochemistry), and the levels of testosterone, INSL3 and inhibin B were measured using immunoassays. The levels of mRNA encoding key enzymes of bisphenol biotransformation were investigated by quantitative PCR: UGT2B15 UDP (glucuronosyltransferase two family, polypeptide B15), GUSB (glucuronidase beta), SULT1A1 and 3 (sulfotransferase family 1 A member 1 and 3) and STS (steroid sulfatase).  Main results and the role of chance:   A significant dose-dependent inhibition was found between testosterone levels measured in the culture medium and concentrations of BPA (P = 0.00778 at 24 h and P = 0.0291 at 48 h), BPE (P = 0.039) and BPF (P = 0.00663). The observed BPA and BPA-A-induced inhibition of testosterone production varied according to duration of exposure and BPA/BPA-A concentrations. BPA (10-9 M; P < 0.05), BPB (10-9 M; P < 0.05), BPS (10-9 and 10-8 M; P < 0.05) and BADGE (10-5 M; P < 0.05) increased Leydig cell INSL3 production. By contrast, BPE dose dependently inhibited INSL3 (P = 0.0372). Conversely, Sertoli cell function (inhibin B) and germ cell viability were not significantly affected by either bisphenols.  Large scale data:   N/A.  Limitations, reasons for caution:   Environmental compounds cannot be deliberately administered to men, justifying the use of an ex vivo approach. A relatively low number of testes samples were available for analysis (n = 3, except for testosterone secretion with n = 5). The active concentrations of BPA and BPA-A used in the study were higher than those found in human biological fluids.  Wider implications of the findings:   Under our experimental conditions, direct exposure to BPA or BPA-A can result in endocrine disturbance in the adult human testis.

Methods:   Eighty-eight patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent prostate cancer participated in 2 prospective trials. Safety reporting was identical in the 2 trials. The Ga-PSMA-11 ligand was administered as 2 MBq/kg body weight (mean, 9.2 μg, 9.7 nmol). The reporting of clinical adverse events (AEs) and the measurement of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were performed prior to injection (baseline); immediately after injection of Ga-PSMA-11 (postinjection); at 1, 10, and 60 minutes after injection; and after acquisition of the PET/CT scan (postscan). All hemodynamic assessments were performed in the supine position, except for the postscan measurement (sitting). The patients were interviewed regarding any AEs at baseline, postinjection, or postscan. In addition, the patients were instructed to report any AEs during the investigation and to contact the investigator if AEs occurred during the rest of the day. Adverse events were classified as mild, moderate, or severe by the patients and categorized by the investigator using the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) version 4.0.  Results:   There were no reported clinical AEs. There were significant decreases in systolic BP (P < 0.001) and HR (P < 0.001) over time. In comparison, the diastolic BP increased significantly (P < 0.001). After removal of the last observation (supine position), there was no time-dependent change in systolic or diastolic BP, but the significant change in HR remained. The mean changes over the entire observation period were minimal (systolic BP, -6 to 5 mm Hg; diastolic BP, -2 to 3 mm Hg; HR, decrease of 5 beats/min). No patients developed hypotension. Fifty-five patients presented with hypertension at baseline, which increased by 1 CTCAE grade in 15 patients and by 2 grades in 2 patients.

Methods:   Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans in 55 men performed for prostate cancer (49) or renal cell carcinoma (6) staging were analyzed retrospectively. Two radiologists evaluated the datasets in 2 reading sessions. First, physiological Ga-PSMA uptake was evaluated. Second, scans were analyzed for incidental uptake. SUVmax and SUVmean were recorded. Other imaging modalities, histopathology, or clinical follow-up served as standard of reference.  Results:   Homogenous Ga-PSMA uptake of the lacrimal glands (SUVmax, 15.7 ± 7.2), parotid glands (SUVmax, 24.4 ± 8.1), submandibular glands (SUVmax, 26.7 ± 7.1), vocal cords (SUVmax, 8.4 ± 3), Waldeyer ring (SUVmax, 10.4 ± 4.3), liver (SUVmax, 8.2 ± 2.5), spleen (SUVmax, 10.9 ± 3.9), kidneys (SUVmax, 66.4 ± 25.4), and pars descendens duodeni (SUVmax, 17.6 ± 8.9) was observed in all patients. In 65% and 36%, respectively, homogenous Ga-PSMA uptake of the colon descendens (SUVmax, 10.6 ± 9.2) and the rectum (SUVmax, 3.7 ± 1.1) was found. Approximately 22% exhibited a Ga-PSMA uptake of the thyroid (SUVmax, 4.5 ± 1.2), and 21% exhibited a Ga-PSMA uptake of the knee's synovia (SUVmax, 2.9 ± 0.2). Furthermore, Ga-PSMA uptake was found in 1 patient because of fibrous dysplasia of the right os ilium (SUVmax, 7.7).  Conclusions:   Physiologic distribution of Ga-PSMA comprises uptake in lacrimal and salivary glands, vocal cords, Waldeyer ring, liver, spleen, and kidneys as well as various parts of the intestine. Moreover, nonspecific tracer uptake is regularly found in the thyroid and the synovia of the knee.

Patients and methods:   Men who underwent RP for Gleason score ≤6 PCa at three institutions (Martini Clinic [MC], Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center [DVA] and Intermountain Healthcare [IH]) were identified. The CCP score was obtained from diagnostic (DVA, IH) or simulated biopsies (MC). The primary outcome was biochemical recurrence (BCR; prostate-specific antigen ≥0.2 ng/mL) after RP. The prognostic utility of the CCP score was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models in the subset of men meeting NCCN low-risk criteria and in the overall cohort.  Results:   Among the 236 men identified, 80% (188/236) met the NCCN low-risk criteria. Five-year BCR-free survival for the low (<0), intermediate (0-1) and high (>1) CCP score groups was 89.2%, 80.4%, 64.7%, respectively, in the low-risk cohort (P = 0.03), and 85.9%, 79.1%, 63.1%, respectively, in the overall cohort (P = 0.041). In multivariable models adjusting for clinical and pathological variables with the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score, the CCP score was an independent predictor of BCR in the low-risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.77 per unit score, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21, 2.58; P = 0.003) and overall cohorts (HR 1.41 per unit score, 95% CI 1.02, 1.96; P = 0.039).  Conclusion:   In a cohort of men with NCCN-defined low-risk PCa, the CCP score improved clinical risk stratification of men who were at increased risk of BCR, which suggests the CCP score could improve the assessment of candidacy for active surveillance and guide optimum treatment selection in these patients with otherwise similar clinical characteristics.""","""['Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'Meera R Chappidi', 'Jay T Bishoff', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Julia Reid', 'Michael Brawer', 'Steven Stone', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Ashley E Ross']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Prognostic Utility of Biopsy-Derived Cell Cycle Progression Score in Patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: Implications for Treatment Guidance.', 'Cell cycle progression score improves risk stratification in prostate cancer patients with adverse pathology after radical prostatectomy.', 'Validation of a cell-cycle progression gene panel to improve risk stratification in a contemporary prostatectomy cohort.', 'Analysis of the prognostic utility of the cell cycle progression (CCP) score generated from needle biopsy in men treated with definitive therapy.', 'Prolaris Cell Cycle Progression Test for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Outcomes of Grade Group 2 and 3 Prostate Cancer on Initial Versus Confirmatory Biopsy: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Validation of the cell cycle progression score to differentiate indolent from aggressive prostate cancer in men diagnosed through transurethral resection of the prostate biopsy.', 'Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.', 'SelectMDx and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate for Men Undergoing Primary Prostate Biopsy: A Prospective Assessment in a Multi-Institutional Study.', 'Prostate cancer biomarkers and multiparametric MRI: is there a role for both in prostate cancer management?', 'Cell-cycle risk score more accurately determines the risk for metastases and death in prostatectomy patients compared with clinical features alone.']"""

The survival pathway of Akt, its downstream effectors, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70 S6K), and the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2) pathways are activated in cancer leading to cell survival and growth. Thus, approaches that inhibit these signaling molecules may prove useful in the fight against lung cancer. Exercise is associated with health benefits and a limited number of studies indicate that serum from physically active individuals inhibit mammary and prostate cancer cell growth. In this study, we examined the effects of post exercise serum on proliferation, survival, and signaling cascades of human NSCLC cells. Blood was collected from male subjects prior to, 5 min, 1 h, and 24 h after a single bout of high intensity interval exercise on a cycle ergometer. Exposure of NSCLC cells to post exercise serum resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation and survival, as well as significant reduction of phosphorylated/activated Akt, mTOR, p70 S6K, and Erk1/2 levels compared to cells treated with serum taken pre-exercise.

Materials and methods:   We obtained gender-specific, age-standardized incidence and mortality rates for 184 countries and 16 major world regions from the GLOBOCAN 2012 database. We compared the mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) at national and regional levels in males and females, and assessed the association with socio-economic development using the 2014 United Nations Human Development Index (HDI).  Results:   Age-standardized incidence rates were 2.9 (bladder) to 7.4 (testis) times higher for genitourinary malignancies in more developed countries compared with less developed countries. Age-standardized mortality rates were 1.5-2.2 times higher in more vs less developed countries for prostate, bladder and kidney cancer, with no variation in mortality rates observed in testis cancer. There was a strong inverse relationship between HDI and MIR in testis (regression coefficient 1.65, R2 = 0.78), prostate (regression coefficient -1.56, R2 = 0.85), kidney (regression coefficient -1.34, R2 = 0.74), and bladder cancer (regression coefficient -1.01, R2 = 0.80).  Conclusion:   While incidence and mortality rates for genitourinary cancers vary widely throughout the world, the MIR is highest in less developed countries for all four major genitourinary malignancies.

However, the role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as BPH risk factor is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine risk of BPH by NSAID use in a population-based cohort.  Methods:   A total of 74 754 Finnish men without previous BPH at baseline in 1996-1999 were linked to national medication reimbursement database for information on physician-prescribed NSAID purchases during 1995-2009. Information on BPH procedures and diagnoses was obtained from national Care Register for Health Care. Cox regression with adjustment for age and use of cholesterol-lowering, antidiabetic and antihypertensive medication, with NSAID use as time-dependent variable was used to analyse the risk of BPH surgery, medication use, and recorded diagnosis.  Results:   Of the subjects 57 707 men (77.2%) used prescription NSAIDs. The risk of BPH was elevated among NSAID users compared to non-users: HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.97-2.10 for BPH medication use, HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.47-1.71 for recorded diagnosis and HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.49-1.74 for surgery. The risk increase correlated with duration of NSAID usage, less with annual dosage. Nevertheless, the risk increase was observed already at short-term and low-dosage use.  Conclusions:   NSAID use is associated with an increased risk of BPH. The association is affected by systematic differences by NSAID use as the risk increase was observed already at short-term use. Nevertheless, the association correlated with duration of use, suggesting that NSAID usage or the conditions indicating it may increase BPH risk.""","""['Lotta H Nygård', 'Kirsi Talala', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Anssi Auvinen', 'Teemu J Murtola']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Allopurinol and risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia in a Finnish population-based cohort.', 'Antidiabetic drugs, glycemic control\xa0and risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Indications for and use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and the risk of incident, symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia: results from the prostate cancer prevention trial.', 'Postoperative non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colorectal anastomotic leakage.

The Environmental Quality Index (EQI) is a county-level measure of cumulative environmental exposures that occur in 5 domains.  Methods:   The EQI was linked to county-level annual age-adjusted cancer incidence rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program state cancer profiles. All-site cancer and the top 3 site-specific cancers for male and female subjects were considered. Incident rate differences (IRDs; annual rate difference per 100,000 persons) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using fixed-slope, random intercept multilevel linear regression models. Associations were assessed with domain-specific indices and analyses were stratified by rural/urban status.  Results:   Comparing the highest quintile/poorest environmental quality with the lowest quintile/best environmental quality for overall EQI, all-site county-level cancer incidence rate was positively associated with poor environmental quality overall (IRD, 38.55; 95% CI, 29.57-47.53) and for male (IRD, 32.60; 95% CI, 16.28-48.91) and female (IRD, 30.34; 95% CI, 20.47-40.21) subjects, indicating a potential increase in cancer incidence with decreasing environmental quality. Rural/urban stratified models demonstrated positive associations comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles for all strata, except the thinly populated/rural stratum and in the metropolitan/urbanized stratum. Prostate and breast cancer demonstrated the strongest positive associations with poor environmental quality.  Conclusion:   We observed strong positive associations between the EQI and all-site cancer incidence rates, and associations differed by rural/urban status and environmental domain.

We surveyed 615 survivors of breast, colorectal, prostate, lung cancer, and melanoma enrolled in three health plans to examine cancer survivors' self-reported discussions of follow-up care, including the need for surveillance, late and long-term effects, emotional needs, and health behaviors. We assessed whether cancer survivors received a written treatment summary and post-treatment care instructions. Most (92%) survivors reported having a discussion about the need for surveillance; 75%, late and long-term effects; 69%, lifestyle and health behaviors; and 53%, emotional and social needs. Most (88%) reported receiving post-treatment care instructions and 47%, a treatment summary. While there was little difference among survivors' receipt of surveillance or health behavior recommendations by cancer type (p = 0.85 and p = 0.66, respectively), discussions of late and long-term effects occurred among 82% of prostate, 78% of breast, 73% of melanoma, 72% of colorectal, and 67% of lung survivors (p = 0.06). Approximately half of survivors reported discussions of emotional needs, with modest differences by cancer type (p = 0.08). Our findings indicate that most patient-provider discussions cover information on surveillance, with less emphasis on late and long-term effects, lifestyle and health behaviors, and substantially less focusing on emotional and social needs. No or modest differences in discussions occurred by cancer type. Whether tailoring information to individual cancer survivor needs is beneficial should be examined.""","""['Sarah C Reed', 'Rod Walker', 'Rebecca Ziebell', 'Borsika Rabin', 'Stephanie Nutt', 'Jessica Chubak', 'Larissa Nekhlyudov']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Survivorship Care Planning and Unmet Information and Service Needs Among Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors.', 'Has the Quality of Patient-Provider Communication About Survivorship Care Improved?', 'Impact of Survivorship Care Plans and Planning on Breast, Colon, and Prostate Cancer Survivors in a Community Oncology Practice.', 'Late and long-term effects of breast cancer treatment and surveillance management for the general practitioner.', 'Long-Term Survival of Women with Breast Cancer.

Materials and methods:   A prospective, single-arm, cohort study was initiated in January 2008. Patients were selected according to the following criteria: Gleason sum ≤6 with single positive core with ≤30% core involvement, clinical stage≤T1c, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)≤10 ng/mL, and negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. Follow-up was by PSA measurement every 6 months, prostate biopsies at 1 year and then every 2-3 years, and MRI every year.  Results:   A total of 80 patients were treated with AS. Median follow-up was 52 months (range, 6-96 months). Of them, 39 patients (48.8%) discontinued AS for various reasons (17, disease progression; 9, patient preference; 10, watchful waiting due to old age; 3, follow-up loss; 2, death). The probability of progression was 14.0% and 42.9% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Overall survival was 97.5%. PCa-specific survival was 100%. Progression occurred in 5 of 7 patients (71.4%) with a prostate volume less than 30 mL, 7 of 40 patients (17.5%) with a prostate volume of 30 to 50 mL, and 5 of 33 patients (15.2%) with a prostate volume of 50 mL or larger. There were 8 detectable positive lesions on follow-up MRI. Of them, 6 patients (75%) had actual progressed disease.  Conclusions:   Small prostate volume was associated with a tendency for cancer progression. MRI was helpful and promising for managing AS. Nevertheless, regular biopsies should be performed. AS is a safe and feasible treatment option for very-low-risk PCa in Korea. However, AS should continue to be used in carefully selected patients.""","""['Ji Yong Ha', 'Teak Jun Shin', 'Wonho Jung', 'Byung Hoon Kim', 'Choal Hee Park', 'Chun Il Kim']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Investig Clin Urol""","""['A single-center long-term experience of active surveillance for prostate cancer: 15 years of follow-up.', 'Risk-stratification based on magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density may reduce unnecessary follow-up biopsy procedures in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Regular transition zone biopsy during active surveillance for prostate cancer may improve detection of pathological progression.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Active Surveillance for Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'The prognostic value of the pretreatment serum albumin to globulin ratio for predicting adverse pathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'A single-center long-term experience of active surveillance for prostate cancer: 15 years of follow-up.', 'Defining and Measuring Adherence in Observational Studies Assessing Outcomes of Real-world Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

Methods:   Different chromatographic methods have been done on the organic extract of the marine sponge aiming at isolating the bioactive metabolites. The cytotoxicity of the isolated compounds has been evaluated against the human colorectal cancer cell line; HCT-116, employing SRB assay. The flow cytometry assay was applied to measure the cell cycle analysis.  Results:   Six metabolites (1-6) were obtained. The compounds 4-6 exhibited IC50 values (μM ± SD) of 95.80± 1.34, 14.8 ± 2.33, and 19.8 ± 3.78, respectively. Cell cycle distribution analysis revealed that sipholenol A (5) and sipholenol L (6) induced G2/M and S phase arrest with concomitant increase in the pre-G cell population. Furthermore, 5 and 6 increased the nuclear expression of the pro-apoptotic protein-cleaved caspase-3 that effectively drives cellular apoptosis via caspase-3-dependent pathway.  Conclusions:   The antiproliferative activity of 5 and 6 can be recognized, at least partly, due to their ability to induce cellular apoptosis.  Summary:   Several metabolites were isolated from the marine sponge Callyspongia siphonella. Sipholenol A and sipholenol L exhibited effective cytotoxicity against HCT-116 cells. The observed cytotoxicity involves induction of cellular apoptosis.

Multiple therapeutic options are currently available for hypogonadal men and treatment patterns vary considerably. The safety of testosterone therapy (TTh) remains understudied.  Materials and methods:   A 23-question survey regarding diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism was sent to all members of the Sexual Medicine Society of North America. Subgroup analyses compared responses between sexual medicine fellows and non-fellows, as well as between academic and nonacademic physicians, using a chi-squared analysis.  Results:   A total of 101 responses were included for analysis. The most common cutoff value used to diagnose hypogonadism was 300 ng/dL (55%, range = 200-400 ng/dL), and 31% felt comfortable giving TTh to a symptomatic patient with normal serum testosterone levels. No respondents felt that TTh increased a cardiovascular event risk. Of those surveyed, 68% would prescribe TTh to a hypogonadal man with severe lower urinary tract symptoms, and 64% would offer TTh to a man with low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance. Fellowship-trained physicians were more likely to prescribe TTh to a man with hypogonadism but normal serum testosterone (P = .038), but they differed in the types of therapy they would use for men with hypogonadism who wish to preserve or regain fertility.  Conclusion:   Significant variety exists in the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism. The majority of physicians will only prescribe TTh in the setting of subnormal serum testosterone levels, despite the presence of symptoms.

In this study, we quantify the macroscopic effects of R2* mapping in prostate cancer patients incorporating susceptibility matching and field strengths effects.  Materials and methods:   91 patients were scanned without endorectal coil (ERC) at 3T. Only when rectal gas was absent, data was included for analysis. Another group of 10 patients was scanned using a susceptibility matched ERC. To assess the residual contamination of R2 and macroscopic field non-uniformities, a group of 10 patients underwent ultra-high resolution 7T MRI.  Results:   Of the patients scanned at 3T 60% presented rectal gas and were excluded, due to susceptibility artifacts. At 3T the tumor was significantly different (P<0.01) from the healthy surrounding tissue in R2* values at intrapatient level. Using the measured median R2* value of 24.9s-1 at 3T and 43.2s-1 at 7T of the peripheral zone, the minimum contribution of macroscopic susceptibility effects is 15% at 3T.  Conclusion:   R2* imaging might be a promising tool for hypoxia imaging, particularly when minimizing macroscopic susceptibility effects contaminating intrinsic R2* of tissue, such as rectal gas. At 3T macroscopic effects still contribute 15% in the R2* value, compared to ultra-high resolution R2* mapping at 7T.""","""['Mariska P Luttje', 'Laurens D van Buuren', 'Peter R Luijten', 'Marco van Vulpen', 'Uulke A van der Heide', 'Dennis W J Klomp']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Comparing signal-to-noise ratio for prostate imaging at 7T and 3T.', 'T2- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at 3T for the detection of prostate cancer with and without endorectal coil: An intraindividual comparison of image quality and diagnostic performance.', 'T2-weighted prostate MRI at 7 Tesla using a simplified external transmit-receive coil array: correlation with radical prostatectomy findings in two prostate cancer patients.', 'Changes in prostate shape and volume and their implications for radiotherapy after introduction of endorectal balloon as determined by MRI at 3T.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Can the apparent transverse relaxation rate (R2*) evaluate the efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma? a preliminary experience.', 'Blood oxygenation level-dependent MRI at 3T for differentiating prostate cancer from benign tissue: a preliminary experience.', 'Quantitative imaging for radiotherapy purposes.', 'Quantitative MRI Changes During Weekly Ultra-Hypofractionated Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy With Integrated Boost.']"""

We report here the results of the first efficacy and safety study of radium-223 dichloride in a Japanese population.  Methods:   In this open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized, phase I trial, radium-223 dichloride was given to Japanese patients with CRPC and ≥2 bone metastases in 4-week cycles. The patients were divided into three cohorts, with cohort 1 and the expansion cohort receiving injections of radium-223 dichloride [55 kBq/kg body weight (BW)] every 4 weeks (Q4W) for up to six injections, and cohort 2 receiving an initial single radium-223 dichloride injection of 110 kBq/kg BW followed by up to five injections of 55 kBq/kg BW Q4W. Safety was determined via adverse event (AE) reporting, and biochemical bone markers were assessed for treatment efficacy.  Results:   In total 19 patients received at least one dose of radium-223 dichloride and 18 patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) of which the most common were anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia. Serious AEs were reported in three patients but none were drug-related. In the patients of cohort 1 + expansion cohort (55 kBq/kg BW Q4W treatment; n = 16), prostate-specific antigen levels remained stable or slightly increased while the bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level significantly decreased. The response rates of bone ALP (≥30 and ≥50% reductions) were 81.8 and 36.4% at week 12, and 81.3 and 50.0% at the end of treatment.  Conclusions:   Radium-223 dichloride was well tolerated in these Japanese patients and, at a dose of 55 kBq/kg BW, efficacy on biomarkers was as expected. The outcomes in Japanese patients were consistent with those reported in other non-Japanese populations.

Materials and methods:   All biopsies performed in the Rotterdam section of the ERSPC between 1993 and 2015 were included. Biopsy complications and hospital admission data were prospectively recorded in questionnaires that were completed 2 weeks after biopsy. The ERSPC risk calculators 3 (RC3) and 4 (RC4) were applied to men attending the first and subsequent rounds of screening, respectively. Applying the predefined RC3/4 probability thresholds for prostate cancer (PCa) risk of ≥12.5% and high-grade PCa risk ≥3%, we assessed the number of complications, admissions and costs that could be reduced by avoiding biopsies in men below these thresholds.  Results:   A total of 10 747 biopsies with complete questionnaires were included. For these biopsies a complication rate of 67.9% (7294/10 747), a post-biopsy fever rate of 3.9% (424/10747) and a hospital admission rate of 0.9% (92/10747) were recorded.

Among 7704 biopsies which fit the criteria for RC3 or RC4, 35.8% of biopsies (2757/7704), 37.4% of complications (1972/5268), 39.4% of fever events (128/325) and 42.3% of admissions (30/71) could have been avoided by using one of the risk calculators. More complications could have been avoided if RC4 had been used and for more recent biopsies (2009-2015). Our findings show that 35.9% of the total cost of biopsies and complication treatment could have been avoided.

Chr8p21 deletions increase significantly with tumor grade and are associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer (PCa), suggesting critical involvement of this region in tumor progression. Recent studies suggest that apart from NKX3.1, this region harbors alternative tumor suppressors that are yet undefined. We proposed a novel, paradigm shifting hypothesis that this locus is associated with a miRNA gene cluster-miR-3622a/b- that plays a crucial suppressive role in PCa. Here we demonstrate the crucial role of miR-3622a in prostate cancer epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). MicroRNA expression profiling in microdissected human PCa clinical tissues showed that miR-3622a expression is widely downregulated and is significantly correlated with poor survival outcome and tumor progression. To understand the functional significance of miR-3622a, knockdown and overexpression was performed using non-transformed prostate epithelial and PCa cell lines, respectively, followed by functional assays. Our data demonstrate that endogenous miR-3622a expression is vital to maintain the epithelial state of normal and untransformed prostate cells. miR-3622a expression inhibits EMT, progression and metastasis of PCa in vitro and in vivo. Further, we found that miR-3622a directly targets EMT effectors ZEB1 and SNAI2.

This study has potentially significant implications in the field of prostate cancer as it identifies an important miRNA component of a frequently lost chromosomal region with critical roles in prostate carcinogenesis which is a highly significant step towards understanding the mechanistic involvement of this locus.

However, some men likely to benefit from the test may be seen in primary care settings where the digital rectal examination (DRE) information is not always obtained. In this study, we assessed the clinical validity of the 4Kscore Test when the DRE information was not included in the algorithm.  Methods:   The Prospective 4Kscore Validation Study enrolled 1012 men scheduled for prostate biopsy across 26 urology practices in the United States. The 4Kscore was calculated for each patient with and without DRE information. The primary outcome was Gleason ≥7 prostate cancer on prostate biopsy. The contribution of DRE to the predictive accuracy of the test was evaluated by area under the receiver operating curve (AUC-ROC), risk calibration and clinical consequences.  Results:   High-grade, aggressive prostate cancer was found in 231 (23%) of the 1012 patients. Both versions of the 4Kscore Test, with and without DRE, showed excellent discrimination (AUC=0.821 with DRE and AUC=0.818 without DRE input) and excellent calibration. No clinically significant difference was found between the two versions of the 4Kscore.  Conclusions:   The 4Kscore Test algorithm, whether DRE findings are available or not, performs well in predicting a man's risk of high-grade, aggressive prostate cancer. Patients who are suspected of having aggressive prostate cancer can safely have their risk better defined by 4Kscore even if a DRE has not been performed recently.""","""['Stephen M Zappala', 'Yan Dong', 'Vincent Linder', 'Michael Reeve', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Vinita Mathur', 'Richard Roberts', 'David Okrongly', 'Jay Newmark', 'Garnnum Sant', 'Mitchell Steiner']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Clin Pract""","""['Make the DRE great again.', 'A multi-institutional prospective trial in the USA confirms that the 4Kscore accurately identifies men with high-grade prostate cancer.', 'The 4Kscore Predicts the Grade and Stage of Prostate Cancer in the Radical Prostatectomy Specimen: Results from a Multi-institutional Prospective Trial.', 'The effect of digital rectal exam on the 4Kscore for aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Defining prostate cancer risk before prostate biopsy.', 'Digital Rectal Examination for Prostate Cancer Screening in Primary Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Molecular Biomarkers for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: protocol for updating multiple systematic reviews to inform a Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care guideline update.', 'Population-based randomized trial of screening for clinically significant prostate cancer ProScreen: a pilot study.', 'Biomarkers for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: contemporary clinical data and future directions.', 'Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.']"""

HVJ-E also induces antitumor immunity by activating natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells and suppressing regulatory T cells in vivo. We conducted an open-label, single-arm, phase I/II clinical trial in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) to determine the safety and efficacy of intratumoral and subcutaneous injection of HVJ-E. Patients with CRPC who were docetaxel-resistant or could not receive docetaxel treatment were eligible. HVJ-E was injected directly into the prostate on day 1 and subcutaneously on days 5, 8 and 12 in two 28-day treatment cycles using a 3+3 dose-escalation design. The primary end points were to evaluate safety and tolerability of HVJ-E. The secondary end points were to analyze tumor immunity and antitumor effect. The study is registered at UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number UMIN000006142. Seven patients were enrolled, and six patients received HVJ-E. Grade 2 or 3 adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Ver. 4.0) were urinary retention and lymphopenia from which the patients recovered spontaneously. No Grade 4 adverse events were observed. Radiographically, three patients had stable disease in the low-dose group, and one patient had stable disease and two had progressive disease in the high-dose group. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declined from 14 to 1.9 ng ml-1 in one patient in the low-dose group after two cycles of HVJ-E treatment, and the PSA response rate was 16.6%. NK cell activity was elevated from day 12 to day 28 after HVJ-E administration, whereas serum interleukin-6, interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ levels were not affected by HVJ-E treatment.

Several factors have been hypothesized to cause inflammation, yet the role each may play in the etiology of prostatic inflammation remains unclear. This study examined the possibility that the common protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii induces prostatic inflammation and reactive hyperplasia in a mouse model.  Methods:   Male mice were infected systemically with T. gondii parasites and prostatic inflammation was scored based on severity and focality of infiltrating leukocytes and epithelial hyperplasia. We characterized inflammatory cells with flow cytometry and the resulting epithelial proliferation with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation.  Results:   We found that T. gondii infects the mouse prostate within the first 14 days of infection and can establish parasite cysts that persist for at least 60 days. T. gondii infection induces a substantial and chronic inflammatory reaction in the mouse prostate characterized by monocytic and lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate. T. gondii-induced inflammation results in reactive hyperplasia, involving basal and luminal epithelial proliferation, and the exhibition of proliferative inflammatory microglandular hyperplasia in inflamed mouse prostates.  Conclusions:   This study identifies the common parasite T. gondii as a new trigger of prostatic inflammation, which we used to develop a novel mouse model of prostatic inflammation. This is the first report that T. gondii chronically encysts and induces chronic inflammation within the prostate of any species. Furthermore, T. gondii-induced prostatic inflammation persists and progresses without genetic manipulation in mice, offering a powerful new mouse model for the study of chronic prostatic inflammation and microglandular hyperplasia.""","""['Darrelle L Colinot', 'Tamila Garbuz', 'Maarten C Bosland', 'Liang Wang', 'Susan E Rice', 'William J Sullivan Jr', 'Gustavo Arrizabalaga', 'Travis J Jerde']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A human prostatic bacterial isolate alters the prostatic microenvironment and accelerates prostate cancer progression.', 'Acute bacterial inflammation of the mouse prostate.', 'Impact of Engineered Expression of Mitochondrial Association Factor 1b on Toxoplasma gondii Infection and the Host Response in a Mouse Model.', 'Inflammatory response to Trichomonas vaginalis in the pathogenesis of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The controversial relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: the role of inflammation.', 'Factors Influencing Tissue Cyst Yield in a Murine Model of Chronic Toxoplasmosis.', 'Comprehensive Overview of Toxoplasma gondii-Induced and Associated Diseases.', 'Osteopontin Deficiency Ameliorates Prostatic Fibrosis and Inflammation.', 'Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling differentially regulate oncogenic ERG mediated transcription in prostate cells.', 'The Bradyzoite: A Key Developmental Stage for the Persistence and Pathogenesis of Toxoplasmosis.']"""

The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of several variables with possible influence on PSMA ligand uptake in a large cohort.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 1007 consecutive patients who were scanned with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (1 h after injection) from January 2014 to January 2017 to detect recurrent disease. Patients with untreated primary PCa or patients referred for PSMA radioligand therapy were excluded. The possible effects of different variables including PSA level and PSA doubling time (PSADT), PSA velocity (PSAVel), Gleason score (GSC, including separate analysis of GSC 7a and 7b), ongoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), patient age and amount of injected activity were evaluated.  Results:   In 79.5% of patients at least one lesion with characteristics suggestive of recurrent PCa was detected. A pathological (positive) PET/CT scan was associated with PSA level and ADT.

Conclusion: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT detects tumour lesions in a high percentage of patients with recurrent PCa. Tumour detection is clearly associated with PSA level and ADT. Only a tendency for an association without statistical significance was found between higher GSC and a higher probability of a pathological PET/CT scan.

Although these 3D classical spheroid platforms provide a significant advance over 2D models mimicking in vivo tumors, the limitations involve no control of assembly and structure with only limited spatial or glandular organization. Here, matrix-free prostaspheres from human metastatic prostate carcinoma PC3 and DU145 cell lines and their respective gemcitabine resistant (GemR) variants were generated by using cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Lys peptide modified with 4-carboxybutyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide (cyclo-RGDfK(TPP)).  Materials and methods:   Microscopic imaging, immunocytochemistry (ICC), flow cytometry, sialidase, and WST-1 cell viability assays were used to evaluate the formation of multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS), cell survival, morphologic changes, and expression levels of α2,6 and α2,3 sialic acid (SA) and E- and N-cadherin in DU145, PC3, and their GemR variants.  Results:   By using the cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide platform in a dose- and time-dependent manner, both DU145 and DU145GemR cells formed small MCTS. In contrast, PC3 and PC3GemR cells formed irregular multicellular aggregates at all concentrations of cyclo-RGDfK(TPP) peptide, even after 6 days of incubation. ICC and flow cytometry results revealed that DU145 cells expressed higher amounts of E-cadherin but lower N-cadherin compared with PC3 cells. By using Maackia amurensis (α2,3-SA-specific MAL-II) and Sambucus nigra (α2,6-SA specific SNA) lectin-based cytochemistry staining and flow cytometry, it was found that DU145 and DU145GemR cells expressed 5 times more α2,6-SA than α2,3-SA on the cell surface. PC3 cells expressed 4 times more α2,3-SA than α2,6-SA, and the PC3GemR cells showed 1.4 times higher α2,6-SA than α2,3-SA. MCTS volume was dose-dependently reduced following pretreatment with α2,6-SA-specific neuraminidase (Vibrio cholerae). Oseltamivir phosphate enhanced cell aggregation and compaction of 3D MCTS formed with PC3 cells.

We developed a gene expression signature of GS to enhance the prediction of PCa outcomes. Elastic net was used to construct a gene expression signature by contrasting GS 8-10 vs. ≤6 tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The constructed signature was then evaluated for its ability to predict recurrence and metastatic-lethal (ML) progression in a Fred Hutchinson (FH) patient cohort (N=408; NRecurrence=109; NMLprogression=27). The expression signature included transcripts representing 49 genes. In the FH cohort, a 25% increase in the signature was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.51 (P=2.7×10-5) for recurrence. The signature's area under the curve (AUC) for predicting recurrence and ML progression was 0.68 and 0.76, respectively. Compared to a model with age at diagnosis, pathological stage and GS, the gene expression signature improved the AUC for recurrence (3%) and ML progression (6%). Higher levels of the signature were associated with increased expression of genes in cell cycle-related pathways and decreased expression of genes in androgen response, estrogen response, oxidative phosphorylation, and apoptosis.

We showed here that HHP treatment of selected human cancer cell lines leads to a degradation of tumor antigens which depends on the magnitude of HHP applied and on the cancer cell line origin. Whereas prostate or ovarian cell lines displayed little protein antigen degradation with HHP treatment up to 300MPa after 2h, tumor antigens are hardly detected in lung cancer cell line after treatment with HHP 250MPa at the same time. On the other hand, quick reduction of tumor antigen-coding mRNA was observed at HHP 200MPa immediately after treatment in all cell lines tested. To optimize the DC-based active cellular therapy protocol for HHP-sensitive cell lines the immunogenicity of HHP-treated lung cancer cells at 150, 200 and 250MPa was compared. Lung cancer cells treated with HHP 150MPa display characteristics of immunogenic cell death, however cells are not efficiently phagocytosed by DC. Despite induction of the highest number of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, 150 MPa-treated lung cancer cells survive in high numbers. This excludes their use in DC vaccine manufacturing. HHP of 200MPa treatment of lung cancer cells ensures the optimal ratio of efficient immunogenic killing and delivery of protein antigens in DC.

Treatment of PC3 cells with 30 and 100μg/ml PE significantly decreased cell viability and proliferation. At the tested concentrations, PE did not exert any antioxidant activity, eliciting instead a pro-oxidant effect at concentrations 30 and 100μg/ml, which was consistent with the observed PE cytotoxicity. PE-induced cell death was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and downregulation of Akt activation, thus suggesting their implication in the PE-elicited cell dysfunction. Cell exposure to the ROS scavenger N-Acetyl Cysteine prevented PE-induced ROS increase, pAkt impairment, and cell death, clearly indicating the causative role of ROS in the observed phenomena. Failure of PE to induce PC3 damage in cells overexpressing Akt further confirms its implication in the PE-elicited cell death.

Methods:   A hit molecule, NSC145366, and structurally similar probes were assessed for inhibition of Hsp90 activities. A ligand-binding model was proposed indicating a novel Hsp90 CTD binding site. Client protein downregulation was also determined.  Results:   NSC145366 interacts with the Hsp90 CTD and has anti-proliferative activity in tumor cell lines (GI50=0.2-1.9μM). NSC145366 increases Hsp90 oligomerization resulting in allosteric inhibition of NTD ATPase activity (IC50=119μM) but does not compete with NTD or CTD-ATP binding. Treatment of LNCaP prostate tumor cells resulted in selective client protein downregulation including AR and BRCA1 but without a heat shock response. Analogs had similar potencies in ATPase and chaperone activity assays and variable effects on oligomerization. In silico modeling predicted a binding site at the CTD dimer interface distinct from the nucleotide-binding site.  Conclusions:   A set of symmetrical scaffold molecules with bisphenol A cores induced allosteric inhibition of Hsp90. Experimental evidence and molecular modeling suggest that the binding site is independent of the CTD-ATP site and consistent with unique induction of allosteric effects.  General significance:   Allosteric inhibition of Hsp90 via a mechanism used by the NSC145366-based probes is a promising avenue for selective oncogenic client downregulation.""","""['Kourtney M Goode', 'Dino P Petrov', 'Renee E Vickman', 'Scott A Crist', 'Pete E Pascuzzi', 'Tim L Ratliff', 'V Jo Davisson', 'Tony R Hazbun']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj""","""['Novobiocin and additional inhibitors of the Hsp90 C-terminal nucleotide-binding pocket.', 'A Novel Class of Hsp90 C-Terminal Modulators Have Pre-Clinical Efficacy in Prostate Tumor Cells Without Induction of a Heat Shock Response.', 'In silico identification and computational analysis of the nucleotide binding site in the C-terminal domain of Hsp90.', ""Identifying a C-terminal ATP binding sites-based novel Hsp90-Inhibitor in silico: a plausible therapeutic approach in Alzheimer's disease."", 'Anticancer Inhibitors of Hsp90 Function: Beyond the Usual Suspects.', 'Recent advances toward the development of Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitors.', 'Structural basis of the key residue W320 responsible for Hsp90 conformational change.', 'Development of a First-in-Class Small-Molecule Inhibitor of the C-Terminal Hsp90 Dimerization.', 'Structure-Activity Relationships of Benzothiazole-Based Hsp90 C-Terminal-Domain Inhibitors.', 'Development of a High-throughput NanoBRET Screening Platform to Identify Modulators of the RAS/RAF Interaction.']"""

For this purpose, α2,6-sialic acid and α1,6-fucose levels of urinary PSA from 53 patients, 18 biopsy-negative and 35 PCa patients of different aggressiveness degree, were analyzed by sandwich ELLA (Enzyme Linked Lectin Assay) using PhoSL and SNA. Changes in the levels of specific glycosylation determinants, that in serum PSA samples were indicative of PCa aggressiveness, were not found in PSA from DRE urine samples. Although urine is a simpler matrix for analyzing PSA glycosylation compared to serum, an immunopurification step was necessary to specifically detect the glycans on the PSA molecule. Those specific glycosylation determinants on urinary PSA were however not useful to improve PCa diagnosis. This could be probably due to the low proportion of PSA from the tumor in urine samples, which precludes the identification of aberrantly glycosylated PSA.""","""['Sílvia Barrabés', 'Esther Llop', 'Montserrat Ferrer-Batallé', 'Manel Ramírez', 'Rosa N Aleixandre', 'Antoinette S Perry', 'Rafael de Llorens', 'Rosa Peracaula']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Chim Acta""","""['Improvement of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis by Detecting PSA Glycosylation-Specific Changes.', 'An In-Depth Glycosylation Assay for Urinary Prostate-Specific Antigen.', 'Glycosylation of urinary prostate-specific antigen in benign hyperplasia and cancer: assessment by lectin-binding patterns.', 'Glycosylation of prostate specific antigen and its potential diagnostic applications.', 'Prostate-specific antigen and other serum and urine markers in prostate cancer.', 'Cancer glycomics offers potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the framework of 3P medicine.', 'Glycosylation in cancer: its application as a biomarker and recent advances of analytical techniques.', 'Narrative review of urinary glycan biomarkers in prostate cancer.', 'Targeted Mass Spectrometry of a Clinically Relevant PSA Variant from Post-DRE Urines for Quantitation and Genotype Determination.', 'Prostate-specific antigen glycoprofiling as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of prostate cancer.']"""

Oral administration of WA for 45 weeks effectively inhibited primary tumor growth in comparison to vehicle controls. Pathological analysis showed the complete absence of metastatic lesions in organs from WA-treated mice, whereas discrete metastasis to the lungs was observed in control tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the down-regulation of pAKT expression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, such as β-catenin and N-cadherin, in WA-treated tumors in comparison to controls.

Objectives:   To identify prostate cancer subtypes based on luminal and basal lineage and to determine associations with clinical outcomes and response to treatment.  Design, setting, and participants:   The PAM50 classifier was used to subtype 1567 retrospectively collected (median follow-up, 10 years) and 2215 prospectively collected prostate cancer samples into luminal- and basal-like subtypes.  Main outcomes and measures:   Metastasis, biochemical recurrence, overall survival, prostate cancer–specific survival, associations with biological pathways, and clinicopathologic variables were the main outcomes.  Results:   Among the 3782 samples, the PAM50 classifier consistently segregated prostate cancer into 3 subtypes in both the retrospective and prospective cohorts: luminal A (retrospective, 538 [34.3%]; prospective, 737 [33.3%]), luminal B (retrospective, 447 [28.5%]; prospective, 723 [32.6%]), and basal (retrospective, 582 [37.1%]; prospective, 755 [34.1%]). Known luminal lineage markers, such as NKX3.1 and KRT18, were enriched in luminal-like cancers, and the basal lineage CD49f signature was enriched in basal-like cancers, demonstrating the connection between these subtypes and established prostate cancer biology. In the retrospective cohort, luminal B prostate cancers exhibited the poorest clinical prognoses on both univariable and multivariable analyses accounting for standard clinicopathologic prognostic factors (10-year biochemical recurrence-free survival [bRFS], 29%; distant metastasis-free survival [DMFS], 53%; prostate cancer-specific survival [PCSS], 78%; overall survival [OS], 69%), followed by basal prostate cancers (10-year bRFS, 39%; DMFS, 73%; PCSS, 86%; OS, 80%) and luminal A prostate cancers (10-year bRFS, 41%; DMFS, 73%; PCSS, 89%; OS, 82%). Although both luminal-like subtypes were associated with increased androgen receptor expression and signaling, only luminal B prostate cancers were significantly associated with postoperative response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in a subset analysis in our retrospective cohorts (n = 315) matching patients based on clinicopathologic variables (luminal B 10-year metastasis: treated, 33% vs untreated, 55%; nonluminal B 10-year metastasis: treated, 37% vs untreated, 21%; P = .006 for interaction).  Conclusions and relevance:   Luminal- and basal-like prostate cancers demonstrate divergent clinical behavior, and patients with luminal B tumors respond better to postoperative ADT than do patients with non–luminal B tumors. These findings contribute novel insight into prostate cancer biology, providing a potential clinical tool to personalize ADT treatment for prostate cancer by predicting which men may benefit from ADT after surgery.""","""['Shuang G Zhao', 'S Laura Chang', 'Nicholas Erho', 'Menggang Yu', 'Jonathan Lehrer', 'Mohammed Alshalalfa', 'Corey Speers', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Won Kim', 'Charles J Ryan', 'Robert B Den', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Edwin Posadas', 'Howard Sandler', 'Eric A Klein', 'Peter Black', 'Roland Seiler', 'Scott A Tomlins', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Robert B Jenkins', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Peter R Carroll', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Felix Y Feng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Prognostic and Predictive Value of a Breast Cancer Expression Signature in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: Lineage predicts ADT response.', 'Re: Associations of Luminal and Basal Subtyping of Prostate Cancer with Prognosis and Response to Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'The evolving role of molecular profiling in prostate cancer: basal and luminal subtyping transcends tissue of origin.', 'Association of Molecular Subtypes With Differential Outcome to Apalutamide Treatment in Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Posttreatment Prostate-Specific Antigen 6\xa0Months After Radiation With Androgen Deprivation Therapy Predicts for Distant Metastasis-Free Survival and Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', 'Adjuvant versus neoadjuvant androgen deprivation with radiotherapy for prostate cancer: does sequencing matter?', 'Manipulation of androgens and alterations in the androgen receptor axis in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Subtypes of Prostate Cancer.', 'Transcriptomic signature defines two subtypes of locally advanced PCa with distinct neoadjuvant therapy benefits.', 'ScRNA-seq revealed an immunosuppression state and tumor microenvironment heterogeneity related to lymph node metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Transcriptomic and clinical heterogeneity of metastatic disease timing within metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Identification and verification of an ALYREF-involved 5-methylcytosine based signature for stratification of prostate cancer patients and prediction of clinical outcome and response to therapies.', 'Basal epithelial cells in prostate development, tumorigenesis, and cancer progression.']"""

In contrast to lineage-restricted Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells (MPCs) found in normal prostate tissue, MSCs with tri-lineage differentiation potential (adipogenesis, osteogenesis, and chondrogenesis) are identified in prostate tissue from a subset of men with prostate cancer, consistent with an influx of more stem-like progenitors (i.e. MSCs) from the bone marrow. Additionally, prostate tissue from a subset of these patients is highly enriched in MSCs, suggesting their enumeration may have prognostic value for identifying men with aggressive disease.

Patients and Methods We evaluated men who were age ≤ 75 years when diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between October 1994 and October 1995 in one of six SEER tumor registries and who completed a 15-year follow-up survey. The survey obtained demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data and measured treatment decision regret, informed decision making, general- and disease-specific quality of life, health worry, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concern, and outlook on life. We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with regret. Results We surveyed 934 participants, 69.3% of known survivors. Among the cohort, 59.1% had low-risk tumor characteristics (PSA < 10 ng/mL and Gleason score < 7), and 89.2% underwent active treatment. Overall, 14.6% expressed treatment decision regret: 8.2% of those whose disease was managed conservatively, 15.0% of those who received surgery, and 16.6% of those who underwent radiotherapy. Factors associated with regret on multivariable analysis included reporting moderate or big sexual function bother (reported by 39.0%; OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.51 to 5.0), moderate or big bowel function bother (reported by 7.7%; OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.04 to 5.15), and PSA concern (mean score 52.8; OR, 1.01 per point change; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.02). Increasing age at diagnosis and report of having made an informed treatment decision were inversely associated with regret. Conclusion Regret was a relatively infrequently reported outcome among long-term survivors of localized prostate cancer; however, our results suggest that better informing men about treatment options, in particular, conservative treatment, might help mitigate long-term regret.

The Selke, Bayarri and Berger calibration is one of the most popular attempts to obtain such a calibration. This relies on the theoretical sampling null distribution of p-values, which is the well-known Uniform(0,1), but arising only for specific sampling models. We generalize this calibration by considering a sampling null distribution estimated from the data. It is possible to obtain such an empirical null distribution, for instance, in the context of multiple testing in which many p-values come from the null model. Such a context is purely instrumental for the purposes of p-value calibration, and multiple testing still needs to be considered with appropriate techniques. The new calibration proposed here still remains a simple analytic formula like the original one under the Uniform(0,1) and basically provides a stronger interpretation framework for the widely used p-value.

In elderly patients, definitive treatment of low-risk PCa must be weighed with the risks of overtreatment. Our aim was to evaluate rates of Gleason score upgrading in patients ≥75 years undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized PCa and to identify predictors associated with upgrading.  Methods:   3296 patients undergoing RP were retrospectively evaluated and categorized into age groups: <70 years (n = 2971) vs. ≥75 years (n = 325). We analyzed prostate-specific antigen (PSA), biopsy counts, Gleason score, pathologic T- and N-stage, and surgical margin. Propensity score matching was performed to compare rates of up- and downgrading on surgical specimen using the new five-tier pathologic grading system. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of upgrading.  Results:   Preoperatively, patients ≥75 years had higher PSA (8.8 vs. 7.3 ng/mL) and lower proportion of grade group 1 (Gleason score 6) at biopsy (29.2 vs. 47.9%; both p < 0.001) compared to patients <70 years. At RP, patients ≥75 years were more likely to have extraprostatic disease (50 vs. 30%) and lower rates of grade group 1 (14.1 vs. 34.8%; both p < 0.001). Postoperative downgrading was similar (15.1 vs. 19.5%). However, patients ≥75 years had higher rates of postoperative upgrading (46.6 vs. 27.9%; p < 0.001). Age ≥75 years, higher PSA levels at RP, and an increased number of positive biopsy cores were associated with upgrading.  Conclusions:   Patients ≥75 years not only demonstrated higher rates of advanced disease but more frequent upgrading on RP specimen. Age ≥75 years, higher PSA levels at RP, and an increased number of positive biopsy cores were predictive for upgrading. The increased risk of upgrading should be taken into consideration when discussing optimal treatment for this specific cohort.""","""['Annika Herlemann', 'Alexander Buchner', 'Alexander Kretschmer', 'Maria Apfelbeck', 'Christian G Stief', 'Christian Gratzke', 'Stefan Tritschler']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Risk of Pathologic Upgrading or Locally Advanced Disease in Early Prostate Cancer Patients Based on Biopsy Gleason Score and PSA: A Population-Based Study of Modern Patients.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'Clinical and pathologic predictors of Gleason sum upgrading in patients after radical prostatectomy: results from a single institution series.', 'Old men with prostate cancer have higher risk of Gleason score upgrading and pathological upstaging after initial diagnosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Risk factors for Gleason Score upgrading following radical prostatectomy.', 'No detrimental effect of a positive family history on postoperative upgrading and upstaging in men with low risk and favourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer: implications for active surveillance.', 'Defining Undertreatment and Overtreatment in Older Adults With Cancer: A Scoping Literature Review.', 'The factors predicting upgrading of prostate cancer by using International Society for Urological Pathology (ISUP) 2014 Gleason grading system.', 'The increase of stage, grading, and metastases in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy during the last decade.', 'Trends in Treatment for Prostate Cancer in China: Preliminary Patterns of Care Study in a Single Institution.']"""

The long noncoding RNA second chromosome locus associated with prostate-1 (SChLAP1) has been found to be overexpressed in a subset of prostate cancer. However, the significance and mechanism of SChLAP1 in prostate cancer are not well known. In this study, we explored the role of SChLAP1 in prostate cancer tissues, cell lines, and mouse models. The effect of SChLAP1 on miR-198 and MAPK1 was specifically examined. We found that SChLAP1 expression was significantly increased in prostate cancer cells and tissues. Knockdown of SChLAP1 promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo. In addition, a potential bonding site between miR-198 and SChLAP1 was predicted, and a low expression of miR-198 was found in prostate cancer tissues and cells. Knockdown of SChLAP1 significantly increased the expression of miR-198, and SChLAP1 overexpression markedly decreased it, indicating that SChLAP1 acted as a negative regulator in the expression of miR-198. Furthermore, our results showed that SChLAP1 interacted with miR-198 and subsequently modulated the MAPK1 signaling pathway in prostate cancer.

Patients and methods - Records of 69 consecutive patients (51 men) who underwent surgery for MSCC as the IMM were reviewed. The patients had no history of cancer when they presented with pain (n = 2) and/or neurological symptoms (n = 67). Results - The primary tumor was identified in 59 patients. In 10 patients, no specific diagnosis could be established, and they were therefore defined as having cancer of unknown primary tumor (CUP). At the end of the study, 16 patients were still alive (median follow-up 2.5 years). The overall survival time was 20 months. Patients with CUP had the shortest survival (3.5 months) whereas patients with prostate cancer (6 years) and myeloma (5 years) had the longest survival. 20 of the 39 patients who were non-ambulatory preoperatively regained walking ability, and 29 of the 30 ambulatory patients preoperatively retained their walking ability 1 month postoperatively. 15 of the 69 patients suffered from a total of 20 complications within 1 month postoperatively.

Interestingly, breast cancer occurs less frequently in AD patients than in the general population. Amyloidosis, the aggregation of amyloid proteins to form amyloid bodies, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AD and other human neuropathies by forming intracellular fibrillary proteins. Contrary to popular belief, amyloidosis is a common occurrence in mammalian cells, and has recently been reported to be a natural physiological process in response to environmental stress stimulations (such as pH and temperature extremes, hypoxia, and oxidative stress). Many proteins contain an intrinsic ""amyloid-converting motif"", which acts in conjunction with a specific noncoding RNA to induce formation of proteinaceous amyloid bodies that are stored in intracellular bundles. In cancer cells such as breast and prostate, the process of amyloidosis induces cells to enter a dormant or resting stage devoid of cell division and proliferation. Therefore, cancer cells undergo growth cessation and enter a dormant stage following amyloidosis in the cell; this is akin to giving the cell AD to cease growth.""","""['Gerald J Mizejewski']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Breast Cancer (Dove Med Press)""","""['Adaptation to Stressors by Systemic Protein Amyloidogenesis.', ""Alzheimer's disease."", 'Microglial Trem2 induces synaptic impairment at early stage and prevents amyloidosis at late stage in APP/PS1 mice.', 'How our bodies fight amyloidosis: effects of physiological factors on pathogenic aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins.', ""Molecular pathology of amyloidogenic proteins and the role of vascular amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease."", 'The Etiology and Pathophysiology Genesis of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A New Perspective.', 'Stromal-driven and Amyloid β-dependent induction of neutrophil extracellular traps modulates tumor growth.', 'Tracking Extracellular Matrix Remodeling in Lungs Induced by Breast Cancer Metastasis.

GDNF, with its coreceptor GFRα1, binds RET and activates downstream pro-oncogenic signaling. Because both GDNF and GFRα1 are secreted by nerves, we examined the role of RET signaling in prostate cancer.Experimental Design: Expression of RET, GDNF, and/or GFRα1 was assessed. The impact of RET signaling on proliferation, invasion and soft agar colony formation, perineural invasion, and growth in vivo was determined. Cellular signaling downstream of RET was examined by Western blotting.Results: RET is expressed in all prostate cancer cell lines. GFRα1 is only expressed in 22Rv1 cells, which is the only line that responds to exogenous GDNF. In contrast, all cell lines respond to GDNF plus GFRα1. Conditioned medium from dorsal root ganglia contains secreted GFRα1 and promotes transformation-related phenotypes, which can be blocked by anti-GFRα1 antibody. Perineural invasion in the dorsal root ganglion assay is inhibited by anti-GFRα antibody and RET knockdown. In vivo, knockdown of RET inhibits tumor growth. RET signaling activates ERK or AKT signaling depending on context, but phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase is markedly increased in all cases. Knockdown of p70S6 kinase markedly decreases RET induced transformed phenotypes. Finally, RET is expressed in 18% of adenocarcinomas and all three small-cell carcinomas examined.Conclusions: RET promotes transformation associated phenotypes, including perineural invasion in prostate cancer via activation of p70S6 kinase. GFRα1, which is secreted by nerves, is a limiting factor for RET signaling, creating a perineural niche where RET signaling can occur.

Here, we investigated the preclinical effects of UNC1999, a dual inhibitor of EZH2 and EZH1, in combination with proteasome inhibitors on multiple myeloma and prostate cancer.Experimental Design:In vitro and in vivo efficacy of UNC1999 and the combination with proteasome inhibitors was evaluated in multiple myeloma cell lines, primary patient cells, and in a xenograft model. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq were performed to uncover the targets of UNC1999 in multiple myeloma. The efficacy of the combination therapy was validated in prostate cancer cell lines.Results: Proteasome inhibitors repressed EZH2 transcription via abrogation of the RB-E2F pathway, thereby sensitizing EZH2-dependent multiple myeloma cells to EZH1 inhibition by UNC1999. Correspondingly, combination of proteasome inhibitors with UNC1999, but not with an EZH2-specific inhibitor, induced synergistic antimyeloma activity in vitro Bortezomib combined with UNC1999 remarkably inhibited the growth of myeloma cells in vivo Comprehensive analyses revealed several direct targets of UNC1999 including the tumor suppressor gene NR4A1 Derepression of NR4A1 by UNC1999 resulted in suppression of MYC, which was enhanced by the combination with bortezomib, suggesting the cooperative blockade of PRC2 function.

To our knowledge, only one study has investigated in a comprehensive way whether a questionnaire used to evaluate HRQoL in cancer patients under active treatment is also reliable and valid when used among (long-term) cancer survivors. In this study we evaluated, in an international context, the psychometrics of HRQoL questionnaires for use among long-term, disease-free, survivors of testicular and prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this cross-sectional study, we recruited long-term survivors of testicular and prostate cancer from Northern and Southern Europe and from the United Kingdom who had participated in two phase III EORTC clinical trials. Participants completed the SF-36 Health Survey, the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, the QLQ-PR25 (for prostate cancer) or the QLQ-TC26 (for testicular cancer) questionnaires, and the Impact of Cancer questionnaire. Testicular cancer survivors also completed subscales from the Nordic Questionnaire for Monitoring the Age Diverse Workforce.  Results:   Two hundred forty-two men (66% response rate) were recruited into the study. The average time since treatment was more than 10 years. Overall, there were few missing questionnaire data, although scales related to sexuality, satisfaction with care and relationship concerns of men without partners were missing in more than 10% of cases. Debriefing showed that in general the questionnaires were accepted well. Many of the survivors scored at the upper extremes of the questionnaires, resulting in floor and ceiling effects in 64% of the scales. All of the questionnaires investigated met the threshold of 0.70 for group level reliability, with the exception of the QLQ-TC26 (mean reliability .64) and the QLQ-PR25 (mean reliability .69).

Results:   The method was validated over various linear ranges: 1-100 ng/mL for abiraterone, 5-500 ng/mL for enzalutamide and enzalutamide carboxylic acid, 10-1000 ng/mL for N-desmethyl enzalutamide, 30-3000 ng/mL for abiraterone N-oxide sulfate, and 100-10,000 ng/mL for abiraterone sulfate. Intra-assay and interassay variabilities were within ±15% of the nominal concentrations for quality control samples at medium and high concentrations and within ±20% at the lower limit of quantification, respectively.  Conclusions:   The described method for simultaneous determination of abiraterone and enzalutamide was validated successfully and provides a useful tool for therapeutic drug monitoring in patients treated with these agents.""","""['Merel van Nuland', 'M J X Hillebrand', 'H Rosing', 'J H M Schellens', 'J H Beijnen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Ther Drug Monit""","""['Simultaneous quantitation of abiraterone, enzalutamide, N-desmethyl enzalutamide, and bicalutamide in human plasma by LC-MS/MS.', 'An LC-MS/MS method for quantification of the active abiraterone metabolite Δ(4)-abiraterone (D4A) in human plasma.', 'LC-MS/MS assay for the quantification of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, cortisol and prednisone in plasma from castrated prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide.', 'What do we know about treatment sequencing of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'A novel approach to assess real-world efficacy of cancer therapy in metastatic prostate cancer.

Studies demonstrate improvements in erectile rigidity and tumescence as a result of smoking cessation. Radical prostatectomy is also associated with worsening of erectile function secondary to damage to the neurovascular bundles. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the relationship between smoking cessation after prostate cancer diagnosis and its effect on sexual function following robotic prostatectomy. We sought to demonstrate the utility of a smoking cessation program among patients with prostate cancer who planned to undergo robotic prostatectomy at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.  Methods:   All patients who underwent robotic prostatectomy between March 2011 and April 2013 with known smoking status were included, and were followed-up through November 2014. All smokers were offered the smoking cessation program, which included wellness coaching, tobacco cessation classes, and pharmacotherapy. Patients completed the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 (EPIC-26) health-related quality-of-life (HR-QOL) survey at baseline and postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. There were 2 groups based on smoking status: Continued smoking vs quitting group. Patient's age, Charlson Comorbidity Score, body mass index, educational level, median household income, family history of prostate cancer, race/ethnicity, language, nerve-sparing status, and preoperative/postoperative clinicopathology and EPIC-26 HR-QOL scores were examined. A linear regression model was used to predict sexual function recovery.  Results:   A total of 139 patients identified as smokers underwent the smoking cessation program and completed the EPIC-26 surveys. Fifty-six patients quit smoking, whereas 83 remained smokers at last follow-up. All demographics and clinicopathology were matched between the 2 cohorts. Smoking cessation, along with bilateral nerve-sparing status, were the only 2 modifiable factors associated with improved sexual function after prostatectomy (6.57 points, p = 0.0226 and 8.97 points, p = 0.0485, respectively).  Conclusion:   In the setting of robotic prostatectomy, perioperative smoking cessation is associated with a significant improvement in long-term sexual functional outcome when other factors are adjusted.""","""['Seena Safavy', 'Patrick S Kilday', 'Jeff M Slezak', 'George A Abdelsayed', 'Teresa N Harrison', 'Steven J Jacobsen', 'Gary W Chien']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Perm J""","""['Recovery of Baseline Erectile Function in Men Following Radical Prostatectomy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Analysis Using Validated Measures.', 'Impacting factors for recovery of erectile function within 1 year following robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Patient- and Surgeon-Level Variation in Patient-Reported Sexual Function Outcomes Following Radical Prostatectomy Over 2 Years: Results From a Statewide Surgical Improvement Collaborative.', 'Perioperative Educational Interventions and Contemporary Sexual Function Outcomes of Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The clinical impact of continued smoking in patients with breast and other hormone-dependent cancer: A systematic literature review.', 'The association of smoking with urinary and sexual function recovery following radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Relationship between cigarette use and prostate cancer risk: what do we know and what should we do?', 'A practical guide for perioperative smoking cessation.', 'Applications of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and prediction of erectile dysfunction: a narrative review.', 'Cigarette Smoking Is Significantly Linked to Sexual Dissatisfaction in Chinese Heroin-Dependent Patients Receiving Methadone Maintenance Treatment.']"""

However, generally, the donor and acceptor pairs were separated in different independent nanostructures, experiencing the challenging issues of limited energy transfer efficiency and luminous stability. Herein, we designed novel ECL-RET model within one nanostructure containing the donor of tris(4,4'-dicarboxylicacid-2,2'-bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) dichloride (Ru(dcbpy)32+) and the acceptor of CdSe@ZnS quantum dots (QDs) for acting as the ECL emitter (QDs-Ru(dcbpy)32+), which significantly reduced the energy loss and improved the ECL efficiency of QDs because of the short path of energy transmission. To demonstrate the proof-of-concept, the proposed QDs-Ru(dcbpy)32+ was employed to construct a new kind of ECL biosensor that could achieve the ultrasensitive detection of microRNA-141 (miRNA-141) combining target recycling amplification and the double-output conversion strategies. Notably, the proposed double-output conversion strategy enabled a small number of miRNA to be successfully transferred into a large number of reporter DNA which could capture numerous QDs-Ru(dcbpy)32+-labeled signal probes on the sensing surface to realize the ECL response to the logarithm of the concentration of miRNA-141. With the ultrahigh-efficient ECL-RET in one nanostructure and the dual amplification including target recycling as well as double-output conversion strategies, the proposed biosensor realized ultrasensitive detection of miRNA-141 and performed the concentration range from 100 aM to 10 pM and the estimated detection limit was 33 aM (S/N = 3). Impressively, this method can sensitively detect the miRNA-141 of human prostate cancer cells and provide a significant boost for the detection of other biomarkers in early cancer diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring.""","""['Zhaoyang Li', 'Zongfan Lin', 'Xiaoyu Wu', 'Haotian Chen', 'Yaqin Chai', 'Ruo Yuan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['A three-dimensional DNA nanomachine with target recycling amplification technology and multiple electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer for sensitive microRNA-141 detection.', 'DNA nanomachine-based regenerated sensing platform: a novel electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer strategy for ultra-high sensitive detection of microRNA from cancer cells.', 'Construction of a Cytosine-Adjusted Electrochemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer System for MicroRNA Detection.', 'Recent developments in electrochemiluminescence nanosensors for cancer diagnosis applications.', 'Nanoarchitecture Frameworks for Electrochemical miRNA Detection.', 'Electrochemiluminescence of Semiconductor Quantum Dots and Its Biosensing Applications: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Measuring nanoparticle-induced resonance energy transfer effect by electrogenerated chemiluminescent reactions.', 'Electrochemiluminescence biosensor for microRNA determination based on AgNCs@MoS2 composite with (AuNPs-Semicarbazide)@Cu-MOF as coreaction accelerator.', 'Application of Zero-Dimensional Nanomaterials in Biosensing.', 'Recent Advances in Electrochemiluminescence Sensors for Pathogenic Bacteria Detection.']"""

The Australian EAP included patient-reported outcomes to evaluate the impact of cabazitaxel on quality of life (QoL). The final safety and QoL results from the Australian EAP for cabazitaxel are reported.  Methods:   Australian patients with mCRPC previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen received cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 ) every 3 weeks plus prednisone/prednisolone (10 mg daily) until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, physician's decision or patient's refusal of further treatment. QoL data was collected using the AQoL-8D questionnaire.  Results:   104 patients from 18 Australian sites (median age at baseline, 70) enrolled in the EAP and completed at least one AQoL-8D questionnaire. Patients received a median of 6 cycles of cabazitaxel. 67 patients (64.4%) experienced grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); the most frequent TEAEs were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhoea, and vomiting.

Patients and methods:   A total of 192 patients (≤65-years-old) were treated with LDR 125I-BT ± hormone therapy. Local failure was defined as any prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise leading to salvage treatment or biochemical failure according to the Phoenix definition. A bounce was defined as a rise in the nadir of ≥0.2 ng/mL followed by spontaneous return. Proportions were compared using Fisher's exact tests; continuous variables using the unpaired t-test or its non-parametric equivalent. Cox proportional hazards models were applied for multivariable survival analysis.  Results:   Median follow-up was 66 months. The 5‑year local recurrence-free survival was 96.1%. Biopsy-proven local recurrence developed in 13 patients, 4 had a Phoenix-defined recurrence at the last follow-up. Androgen deprivation therapy was started in 1 patient without proven recurrence. Univariable risk factors for local recurrence were: at least 50% positive biopsies, intermediate risk, treatment with neoadjuvant hormone therapy, low preimplantation volume receiving 100% of the prescribed dose, and no bounce development. Hormone-naïve patients not attaining a PSA value <0.5 ng/mL during follow-up also had a higher risk of local recurrences. Cox regression demonstrated that the variables ""at least 50% positive biopsies"" and ""bounce"" significantly impacted local failure (hazard ratio, HR 1.02 and 11.59, respectively). A bounce developed in 70 patients (36%).

The interaction between the renin‑angiotensin system (RAS) and relaxin family peptide system (RFPS) is known to influence the proliferation, adhesion and migration of normal and cancer prostate cell lines. The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in the expression of nuclear factor‑κB subunit 1 (NFKB1), nuclear factor‑κB subunit 2 (NFKB2), REL proto‑oncogene nuclear factor‑κB p65 subunit (REL), RELA proto‑oncogene nuclear factor‑κB subunit (RELA) and RELB proto‑oncogene nuclear factor‑κB subunit (RELB) mRNA caused by Ang II and RLN2. The members of NF‑kB family are involved in many processes associated with cancer development and metastasis. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis identified that both peptide hormones have an influence on the relative expression of nuclear factor‑κB. Following treatment with either peptide, NFKB1 expression was downregulated in all prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU‑145 and PC3), but not in normal epithelial cells (PNT1A). Conversely, RELB mRNA was enhanced only in non‑cancerous prostate cells. RELA expression was strongly stimulated in the most aggressive cell line, whereas REL mRNA was unchanged. In many cases, the effect was strictly dependent on the cell line and/or the type of peptide: Ang II increased expression of both RELA and REL genes in the androgen‑dependent cell line while RLN2 enhanced NFKB2 and RELA mRNA in androgen‑independent cells (DU‑145). Further research is needed to understand the regulation of NF‑κB family members by key renin‑angiotensin system and RFPS peptides in prostate cancer cells; however, prostate carcinogenesis appears to be influenced by the balance between the cross‑regulation of nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) and androgen receptor pathways by Ang II and relaxin 2.""","""['Kamila Domińska', 'Karolina Kowalska', 'Zuzanna Elżbieta Matysiak', 'Elżbieta Płuciennik', 'Tomasz Ochędalski', 'Agnieszka Wanda Piastowska-Ciesielska']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['A common effect of angiotensin II and relaxin 2 on the PNT1A normal prostate epithelial cell line.', 'RELA is sufficient to mediate interleukin-1 repression of androgen receptor expression and activity in an LNCaP disease progression model.', 'NF-κB subunits regulate maspin expression in prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Interaction between angiotensin II and relaxin 2 in the progress of growth and spread of prostate cancer cells.', 'NF-κB/Rel Transcription Factors in Pancreatic Cancer: Focusing on RelA, c-Rel, and RelB.', 'An Unexpected Enzyme in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells: Angiotensin II Upregulates Cholesterol-25-Hydroxylase Gene Expression.', 'Suppression of CDCA3 inhibits prostate cancer progression via NF‑κB/cyclin D1 signaling inactivation and p21 accumulation.', 'The Effect of Local Renin Angiotensin System in the Common Types of Cancer.', 'Angiotensin II and Angiotensin Receptors 1 and 2-Multifunctional System in Cells Biology, What Do We Know?', '5-HT7 receptors as a new target for prostate cancer physiopathology and treatment: an experimental study on PC-3 cells and FFPE tissues.']"""

However, its association with non-breast index malignancies, relative to population risk, has not been previously reported.  Materials and methods:   Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (9 catchment area) data, we identified MBCs diagnosed from 1973-2012 as their SPC. Information regarding the index malignancy was also obtained. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) of MBC as SPC were estimated, along with incidence rates and trends. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival.  Results:   Over a 38-year period, 464 MBCs were identified as SPC. The most common index malignancies were breast (SIR 30.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 21.50-42.92, p < .001), lymphoma (SIR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08-2.22, p = .014), melanoma (SIR 1.26, 95% CI 0.80-1.89), urinary (SIR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74-1.43), colorectal (SIR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69-1.24), and prostate (SIR 0.93 95% CI 0.81-1.07). Apart from the known association with prior breast cancer, the only significant association was with lymphoma as an index cancer, although not significant with a Bonferroni correction. From 1975-2012, incidence of breast cancer as a first cancer increased at an annual percentage change of 1.3% while breast cancer as a SPC increased at 4.7% (both p values < .001).  Conclusion:   Male breast cancer as a SPC has increased markedly over 4 decades. Men with a history of lymphoma may experience higher-than-expected rates of breast SPC. These observations warrant further research, and suggest possible etiologic connections with disease biology, prior therapy, or genetics.  Implications for practice:   This study reports that men are presenting more frequently to the clinic with breast cancer, both as an initial cancer and as a second cancer following an earlier malignancy. We also report the novel observation that men who survive lymphoma are at increased risk of developing a subsequent breast cancer. Further work is needed to better understand possible treatment or biologic causes of this association. More immediately, these findings suggest the need for heightened vigilance for male breast cancer overall and, in particular, for male lymphoma survivors.""","""['Deborah E Farr', 'Alexandra Thomas', 'Seema Ahsan Khan', 'Mary C Schroeder']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Descriptive characteristics of prostate cancer in patients with a history of primary male breast cancer - a SEER analysis.', 'Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer as a Second Primary Among Patients With Previous Malignancy: Who Is at Risk?', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Incidence of Second Primary Malignancies in Patients with Neuroendocrine Tumours.', 'Second cancers in patients with male breast cancer: a literature review.', 'Metachronous breast cancer in a male with previous history of liposarcoma: A case report from Syria.', 'Primary Pulmonary Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Mimicking Metastasis: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Risk of second primary breast cancer among cancer survivors: Implications for prevention and screening practice.', 'Male breast cancer: Specific biological characteristics and survival in a Portuguese cohort.']"""

Thus, there is an obvious and urgent need to fully understand the mechanism of CRPC and discover novel therapeutic targets. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial regulators in many human cancers, yet their potential roles and molecular mechanisms in CRPC are poorly understood. In this study, we discovered that an lncRNA HOXD-AS1 is highly expressed in CRPC cells and correlated closely with Gleason score, T stage, lymph nodes metastasis, and progression-free survival. Knockdown of HOXD-AS1 inhibited the proliferation and chemo-resistance of CRPC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we identified several cell cycle, chemo-resistance, and castration-resistance-related genes, including PLK1, AURKA, CDC25C, FOXM1, and UBE2C, that were activated transcriptionally by HOXD-AS1. Further investigation revealed that HOXD-AS1 recruited WDR5 to directly regulate the expression of target genes by mediating histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3). In conclusion, our findings indicate that HOXD-AS1 promotes proliferation, castration resistance, and chemo-resistance in prostate cancer by recruiting WDR5.

We hypothesized that biopsy rates and the change in rates since 2012 would vary considerably across hospital referral regions.  Materials and methods:   Using Medicare data from 2012 through 2014 we identified prostate biopsies performed by physicians who performed 11 or more biopsies annually. We calculated annual biopsy rates and changes in rates from 2012 to 2014 across 306 hospital referral regions. We performed multivariable regression adjusting for factors associated with annual biopsy rates (eg percent of patients older than 75 who were screened with prostate specific antigen and percent of the population that was African American). We also estimated adjusted prostate biopsy rates and changes with time across regions.  Results:   We identified 395,993 biopsies. The overall rates decreased from 11.68 biopsies per 1,000 men in 2012 to 10.23 per 1,000 in 2014 (-12.4%, p = 0.11). Biopsy rates were higher in regions in which a greater percentage of the population was African American (β = 0.810, 95% CI 0.235-1.384, p = 0.006), ambulatory surgical centers were available where biopsy could be performed (β = 0.892, 95% CI 0.108-1.676, p = 0.026) and prostate specific antigen testing occurred more frequently (β = 2.462, 95% CI 1.153-3.771, p <0.001). There was marked geographic variation in the adjusted average biopsy rate (median adjusted rate 9.08 biopsies per 1,000 men, IQR 7.65-10.76) and in the change in biopsy rates with time (median adjusted rate change -1.49 biopsies per 1,000 men, IQR -1.94--1.22 per 1,000).  Conclusions:   Since 2012 there has been considerable geographic variation in the performance of prostate biopsies as well as changes with time after prostate specific antigen recommendations changed.

African-American men have the highest incidence of, and mortality rate from this disease in the United States. According to the American Cancer Society, 29% of all cancer cases and 9% of all cancer deaths are a result of prostate cancer. Individuals who are at highest risk include African-American men, men over 60 years of age, and those with a family history of the disease. African-Americans also have twice the risk of developing prostate cancer as compared to Caucasians. Erythroblastosis virus E26 transformation-specific (ETS) factors play an important role in human cancers. ETS Variant 1 (ETV1), an ETS factor, is notable for its association in prostate cancers, where truncated ETV1 (dETV1) or its full length counterpart is overexpressed in approximately 10% of the prostate cancer patients. Prostate cancer tumorigenesis may be initiated by deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Mutations that stabilize β-catenin were shown to contribute to the loss of cell-growth control in tumorigenesis. We hypothesized that ETV1's interaction with components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway may alter β-catenin's interaction with downstream tumor-suppressor genes, which are critical in regulating apoptosis and cell-growth properties of prostate cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that ETV1 alters β-catenin activity by activating kinases that regulate Wnt/β-catenin activity through post-translational modification in prostate cancer cells. We further demonstrate that therapeutic agents such as PD98059, that reverse effect of ETV1 on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, can be used to target ETV1-positive prostate cancer cells. These therapeutic agents could have a profound impact on prevention and treatment of prostate cancer which may help to reduce health disparity seen in minority patients. Understanding the role of ETV1 in Wnt/β-catenin pathway will also allow us to develop better diagnostic tools, which can be used as a biomarker for ETV1-positive prostate cancers.""","""['Sharif Morsalin', 'Chunshu Yang', 'Jinbo Fang', 'Sampreet Reddy', 'Shubhalaxmi Kayarthodi', 'Ed Childs', 'Roland Matthews', 'Veena N Rao', 'E Shyam P Reddy']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Pharm Sci Pharmacol""","""['Truncated ETV1, fused to novel tissue-specific genes, and full-length ETV1 in prostate cancer.', 'Relationship between ETS Transcription Factor ETV1 and TGF-β-regulated SMAD Proteins in Prostate Cancer.', 'Sumoylation of transcription factor ETV1 modulates its oncogenic potential in prostate cancer.', 'Wnt/beta-catenin/tcf signaling: a critical pathway in gastrointestinal tumorigenesis.', 'Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway as a novel cancer drug target.', 'HGF-mediated elevation of ETV1 facilitates hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis through upregulating PTK2 and c-MET.', 'Function and regulation of the PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors in cancer.']"""

NLG-containing PSSN10 prodrug polymers were self-assembled into nano-sized micelles that served as a carrier to load DOX (DOX/PSSN10 micelles). DOX/PSSN10 micelles displayed spherical morphology with a size of ∼170 nm. DOX was effectively loaded into PSSN10 micelles with a loading efficiency of 84.0%. In vitro DOX release studies showed that rapid drug release could be achieved in the highly redox environment after intracellular uptake by tumor cells. In 4T1.2 tumor-bearing mice, DOX/PSSN10 micelles exhibited greater accumulation of DOX and NLG in the tumor tissues compared with other organs. The PSSN10 carrier dose-dependently enhanced T-cell immune responses in the lymphocyte-Panc02 co-culture experiments, and significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo. DOX/PSSN10 micelles showed potent cytotoxicity in vitro against 4T1.2 mouse breast cancer cells and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells comparable to that of DOX. In 4T1.2 tumor-bearing mice, DOX/PSSN10 mixed micelles (5 mg DOX/kg, iv) was more effective than DOXIL (a clinical formulation of liposomal DOX) or free DOX in inhibiting the tumor growth and prolonging the survival of the treated mice. In addition, a more immunoactive tumor microenvironment was observed in the mice treated with PSSN10 or DOX/PSSN10 micelles compared with the other treatment groups. In conclusion, systemic delivery of DOX via PSSN10 nanocarrier results in synergistic anti-tumor activity.""","""['Jing-Jing Sun', 'Yi-Chao Chen', 'Yi-Xian Huang', 'Wen-Chen Zhao', 'Yan-Hua Liu', 'Raman Venkataramanan', 'Bin-Feng Lu', 'Song Li']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Pharmacol Sin""","""['Synergistic action of doxorubicin and 7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin polyphosphorylcholine polymer prodrug.', 'Doxorubicin delivered by a redox-responsive dasatinib-containing polymeric prodrug carrier for combination therapy.', 'Lymphoma Immunochemotherapy: Targeted Delivery of Doxorubicin via a Dual Functional Nanocarrier.', 'Thermo- and pH dual responsive polymeric micelles and nanoparticles.', 'Cisplatin-Conjugated Polyurethane Capsule for Dual Drug Delivery to a Cancer Cell.', 'Responsive Microneedles as a New Platform for Precision Immunotherapy.', 'Smart Polymeric Nanoparticles in Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Advanced diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in nanotechnology for lung cancer.', 'Revolutionization in Cancer Therapeutics via Targeting Major Immune Checkpoints PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4.', 'Nanomedicine as a Promising Tool to Overcome Immune Escape in Breast Cancer.']"""

The fractions of epithelial pixels positive by immunohistochemistry and ISH were digitally assessed for benign acini, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and 8 morphologic patterns of cancer. Immunostaining results demonstrated that (1) PTEN loss was significant for fused small acini, cribriform-central cells, small cribriform acini, and Gleason grade 5 cells in comparison with other acini; (2) p27 loss was significant only for cribriform-peripheral cells and borderline significant for fused small acini in comparison with benign acini; and (3) CD44v7/8 showed expression loss in cribriform-peripheral cells; other comparisons were not significant. ISH showed that cribriform cancer had significant PTEN loss normalized to benign acini (P<.02), whereas Gleason 3 cancer or fused small acini did not. With CDKN1B, the degree of signal loss among various cancer morphologies was insignificant. In conclusion, molecular disparities emerged between the fused small acini and cribriform patterns of Gleason 4 cancer.

The present study developed and explored indicators of inappropriate TM ordering in outpatients through the data mining of electronic health records (EHRs).  Methods:   Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), carbohydrate antigen (CA)125, CA15.3, CA19.9, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ordered in outpatients during a year were examined by mining EHRs of a Local Health Authority in Italy. Evidence-based criteria were used to develop performance indicators. Demographic and clinical information associated with TM orders were examined.  Results:   A total of 80 813 TMs were ordered in 52 536 outpatients (1.54 markers/patient). Indicators related to disease codes, gender, age, and TM repetitions were developed, and their application showed that (1) CA15.3 and CEA are prevalently requested in patients with cancer (79.2% and 65.6%) whereas the other TMs are largely requested also in patients without cancer; (2) requests of PSA in women and of CA125 or CA15.3 in men are negligible; (3) although requests in people older than 80 years are relevant (16.4% of total), the highest rate of request of all markers occurs in patients aged 40 to 79 years; (4) CA15.3 and CEA are mainly requested in cancer cases between 50 and 79 years and AFP, CA19.9, and CA125 in those between 60 and 69 years; (5) <50% of PSA orders are associated with cancer code for all age intervals; and (6) multiple repetitions of AFP, CA125, CA15.3, CA19.9, and CEA are prevalent in cancer patients or benign diseases to which TMs are appropriate, whereas PSA repetitions occur mainly in patients without cancer.

Buparlisib is an oral, pan-class I PI3 kinase inhibitor.  Methods:   This was a multisite single arm phase II trial of buparlisib 100 mg ± enzalutamide daily in men with mCRPC whose disease progressed on or who were not candidates for docetaxel. The primary end-point was the rate of radiographic/clinical progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months.  Results:   Thirty men were accrued: 67% post-docetaxel; median prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 70 ng/dl, 83% had ≥4 prior therapies for mCRPC; 43% received concurrent enzalutamide. The final 6 month PFS rate was estimated to be 10% (95% confidence interval 2.5-23.6%). Median PFS was 1.9 months and was 3.5 months with concurrent enzalutamide. Median overall survival was 10.6 months. Concurrent enzalutamide led to a five-fold reduction in buparlisib concentrations. PSA declines were observed in 23%; no patients achieved a ≥50% decline, and no radiographic responses were observed. Severe adverse events occurred in four men including respiratory infection and multi-organ failure, urinary tract obstruction, confusion and one seizure in the setting of a new central nervous system (CNS) metastasis. Grade III adverse events were seen in 43% of patients; common toxicities included grade I-II weight loss, diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue, anorexia, rash, hyperglycemia and anxiety/mood disorders.  Conclusions:   Buparlisib did not demonstrate significant activity in men with mCRPC, suggesting that PI3K inhibition is not sufficient to reverse resistant mCRPC progression.

To assess whether the backdoor pathway may contribute to the virilization of pediatric ACTs, we investigated seven children suffering from androgen producing tumors using steroid profiling and immunohistochemical expression studies. All cases produced large amounts of androgens of the classic and/or backdoor pathway. Variable expression of steroid enzymes was observed in carcinomas and adenomas.

Traditional knowledge-based network development of BN topology requires that modeling experts establish relevant dependency links between domain concepts by searching and translating published literature, querying domain experts, or applying machine learning algorithms on data. For initial development these methods are time-intensive and this cost hinders the growth of BN applications in medical decision making. Further, this approach fails to utilize knowledge representation in medical fields to automate network development. Our research alleviates the challenges surrounding BN modeling in radiation oncology by leveraging an ontology based hub and spoke system for BN construction.  Methods:   We implement a hub and spoke system by developing (a) an ontology of knowledge in radiation oncology (the hub) which includes dependency semantics similar to BN relations and (b) a software tool that operates on ontological semantics using deductive reasoning to create BN topologies (the spokes). We demonstrate that network topologies built using the software are terminologically consistent and form networks that are topologically compatible with existing ones. We do this first by merging two different BN models for prostate cancer radiotherapy prediction which contain domain cross terms. We then use the logic to perform discovery of new causal chains between radiation oncology concepts.  Results:   From the radiation oncology (RO) ontology we successfully reconstructed a previously published prostate cancer radiotherapy Bayes net using up-to-date domain knowledge. Merging this model with another similar prostate cancer model in the RO domain produced a larger, highly interconnected model representing the expanded scope of knowledge available regarding prostate cancer therapy parameters, complications, and outcomes. The causal discovery resulted in an automatically-built causal network model of all ontologized radiotherapy concepts between a 'Mucositis' complication and anatomic tumor location.  Conclusions:   The proposed model building approach lowers barriers to developing probabilistic models relevant to real-world clinical decision making, and offers a solution to the consistency and compatibility problems.

Herein, the effects of definitive and salvage RT on the composition of lymphocyte subpopulations were investigated in patients with prostate cancer to study potential immune effects.  Patients and methods:   A total of 33 prostate cancer patients were treated with definitive (n = 10) or salvage RT (n = 23) after biochemical relapse. The absolute number of lymphocytes and the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry before RT, at the end of RT, and in the follow-up period.  Results:   Absolute lymphocyte counts decreased significantly after RT in both patient groups and a significant drop was observed in the percentage of B cells directly after RT from 10.1 ± 1.3 to 6.0 ± 0.7% in patients with definitive RT and from 9.2 ± 0.8 to 5.8 ± 0.7% in patients with salvage RT. In contrast, the percentages of T and natural killer (NK) cells remained unaltered directly after RT in both patient groups. However, 1 year after RT, the percentage of CD3+ T cells was significantly lower in patients with definitive and salvage RT. The percentage of regulatory T cells was slightly upregulated in primary prostate cancer patients after definitive RT, but not after salvage RT.  Conclusion:   Definitive and salvage RT exert similar effects on the composition of lymphocyte subpopulations in prostate cancer patients. Total lymphocyte counts are lower in both patient groups compared to healthy controls and further decreased after RT. B cells are more sensitive to definitive and salvage RT than T and NK cells.""","""['Eva K Sage', 'Thomas E Schmid', 'Hans Geinitz', 'Mathias Gehrmann', 'Michael Sedelmayr', 'Marciana N Duma', 'Stephanie E Combs', 'Gabriele Multhoff']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Salvage prostate re-irradiation using high-dose-rate brachytherapy or focal stereotactic body radiotherapy for local recurrence after definitive radiation therapy.', 'Improved outcomes with higher doses for salvage radiotherapy after prostatectomy.', 'Salvage HDR brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after previous definitive radiation therapy: 5-year outcomes.', 'Salvage radiotherapy for palpable, locally recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'The current understanding of the immune landscape relative to radiotherapy across tumor types.', 'Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy in 3 Fractions Induces a Favorable Systemic Immune Cell Profiling in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Modulation of Peripheral Immune Cell Subpopulations After RapidArc/Moderate Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Findings and Comparison With 3D Conformal/Conventional Fractionation Treatment.', 'NK and cells with NK-like activities in cancer immunotherapy-clinical perspectives.', 'Prognostic Value and Risk Factors of Treatment-Related Lymphopenia in Malignant Glioma Patients Treated With Chemoradiotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Methods:   Data from the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry-Victoria were used to analyze men with Gleason 3 + 3 CaP or less who had at least one repeat biopsy. Unadjusted and adjusted 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to assess the time to grade progression. Both univariate and multivariate analyses for grade progression were performed using Cox proportional hazards.  Results:   The cohort included 951 men. Overall, 39% of men had Gleason grade reclassified to a higher risk disease state with median of 2.2 years [IQR 1.2-3.7 years]. Men who harboured cT2 disease were 30% more likely to have upgrading compared to men with cT1 disease (adjusted HR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6, p = 0.048). Half of the men with cT2 in our cohort had their Gleason grade reclassified within 1.6 years from diagnosis as compared with 2.7 years for the cT1 group. The presence of percentage of core involvement >25.0% and a PSA velocity of >1.01 ng/mL/year remained significant for a higher progression rate. The adjusted HR: 1.6; 95% CI [1.2-2.3], p = 0.004; adjusted HR: 1.6, 95% CI [1.2-2.4], p = 0.021, for percent of core involvement of 25.1-37.5%, and ≥37.6%, respectively. The adjusted HRs and p value associated with PSA velocity were 1.5; 95% CI [1.1-2.1], p = 0.016 and 1.6; 95% CI [1.2-2.3], p = 0.003 for PSA velocity values of 1.01-2 ng/mL per year and >2 ng/mL per year, respectively. Men who were diagnosed in regional hospital and subsequently had biopsy in metropolitan hospital were twice at risk of having Gleason upgrade compared to those whom both diagnostic and surveillance biopsies were carried out in metropolitan hospitals (adjusted HR: 1.9; 95% CI 1.1-3.3, p = 0.029).  Conclusions:   When placing men on AS and considering time to histologic progression, clinicians should pay particular attention to the likely accuracy of the diagnostic specimen, their tumour stage, volume of tumour (percent of core involvement), and rising PSA. Those diagnosed with T2 disease and had >25.0% of core involvement, and a PSA velocity greater than 1 ng/mL per year is at particular risk for more rapid disease progression and, for this reason, should be counselled on the importance of following the recommended surveillance regimen.

The roles of AR and AR variants in the development of resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and bicalutamide treatment, however, are still incompletely understood. To determine whether AR variants play a role in bicalutamide resistance, we developed bicalutamide-resistant LNCaP cells (LNCaP-BicR) and found that these resistant cells express significantly increased levels of AR variants, particularly AR-V7, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Exogenous expression of AR-V7 in bicalutamide-sensitive LNCaP cells confers resistance to bicalutamide treatment. Knockdown of AR-V7 in bicalutamide- and enzalutamide-resistant CWR22Rv1, enzalutamide-resistant C4-2B (C4-2B MDVR), and LNCaP-BicR cells reversed bicalutamide resistance. Niclosamide, a potent inhibitor of AR variants, significantly enhanced bicalutamide treatment. Niclosamide and bicalutamide combination treatment not only suppressed AR and AR variants expression and inhibited their recruitment to the PSA promoter, but also significantly induced apoptosis in bicalutamide- and enzalutamide-resistant CWR22Rv1 and C4-2B MDVR cells. In addition, combination of niclosamide with bicalutamide inhibited the growth of enzalutamide-resistant tumors. In summary, our results demonstrate that AR variants, particularly AR-V7, drive bicalutamide resistance and that targeting AR-V7 with niclosamide can resensitize bicalutamide-resistant cells to bicalutamide treatment. Furthermore, combination of niclosamide with bicalutamide inhibits enzalutamide resistant tumor growth, suggesting that the combination of niclosamide and bicalutamide could be a potential cost-effective strategy to treat advanced prostate cancer in patients, including those who fail to respond to enzalutamide therapy.

Here we show that radiation-resistant cells and tumors derived from a Pten/Trp53-deficient mouse model of advanced prostate cancer are rendered radiation sensitive following treatment with NanoOlaparib, a lipid-based injectable nanoformulation of olaparib. This enhancement in radiosensitivity is accompanied by radiation dose-dependent changes in γ-H2AX expression and is specific to NanoOlaparib alone. In animals, twice-weekly intravenous administration of NanoOlaparib results in significant tumor growth inhibition, whereas previous studies of oral olaparib as monotherapy have shown no therapeutic efficacy. When NanoOlaparib is administered prior to radiation, a single dose of radiation is sufficient to triple the median mouse survival time compared to radiation only controls. Half of mice treated with NanoOlaparib + radiation achieved a complete response over the 13-week study duration. Using ferumoxytol as a surrogate nanoparticle, MRI studies revealed that NanoOlaparib enhances the intratumoral accumulation of systemically administered nanoparticles. NanoOlaparib-treated tumors showed up to 19-fold higher nanoparticle accumulation compared to untreated and radiation-only controls, suggesting that the in vivo efficacy of NanoOlaparib may be potentiated by its ability to enhance its own accumulation. Together, these data suggest that NanoOlaparib may be a promising new strategy for enhancing the radiosensitivity of radiation-resistant tumors lacking BRCA mutations, such as those with PTEN and TP53 deletions.

Metastases occur commonly in lymph nodes and bone but have also been known to involve certain visceral organs, particularly the lungs. Involvement of soft tissue by metastases is far less common, particularly in the context of cancer recurrence. We present the case of a male aged 68 years who presented with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 10 years after radical prostatectomy (RP). The PSA increased despite salvage radiotherapy and was ultimately found to be caused by a PSA secreting prostate cancer soft tissue mass in the suprapubic region. Surgical resection of the mass caused a sharp decline in the PSA to negligible levels. This case highlights the need for ongoing surveillance post-RP and the potential for prostate cancer recurrence in the soft tissue that is refractory to routine salvage radiotherapy.""","""['Munad Khan', 'Adee-Jonathan Davidson', 'Madeleine McKinley', 'Joseph Ischia']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMJ Case Rep""","""['Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is an Independent Predictor of Salvage Radiotherapy Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy.', '(18)F-choline PET/CT for early detection of metastases in biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate specific antigen only progression of prostate cancer.', 'Salvage radical prostatectomy: outcome measured by serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Evaluation and management of prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Participants in the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) were retrospectively identified with the risk prediction tool developed from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. The high-risk subgroup was assessed for lung cancer incidence and demographic characteristics compared with those in the low-risk subgroup and the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (PanCan), which is an observational study that was high-risk-selected in Canada. A comparison of high-risk screening versus standard care was made with a decision-analytic model using data from the NLST with Canadian cost data from screening and treatment in the PanCan study. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty and identify drivers of program efficiency.  Results:   Use of the risk prediction tool developed from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial with a threshold set at 2% over 6 years would have reduced the number of individuals who needed to be screened in the NLST by 81%. High-risk screening participants in the NLST had more adverse demographic characteristics than their counterparts in the PanCan study. High-risk screening would cost $20,724 (in 2015 Canadian dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year gained and would be considered cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 in Canadian dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained with a probability of 0.62. Cost-effectiveness was driven primarily by non-lung cancer outcomes. Higher noncurative drug costs or current costs for immunotherapy and targeted therapies in the United States would render lung cancer screening a cost-saving intervention.  Conclusions:   Non-lung cancer outcomes drive screening efficiency in diverse, tobacco-exposed populations. Use of risk selection can reduce the budget impact, and screening may even offer cost savings if noncurative treatment costs continue to rise.""","""['Sonya Cressman', 'Stuart J Peacock', 'Martin C Tammemägi', 'William K Evans', 'Natasha B Leighl', 'John R Goffin', 'Alain Tremblay', 'Geoffrey Liu', 'Daria Manos', 'Paul MacEachern', 'Rick Bhatia', 'Serge Puksa', 'Garth Nicholas', 'Annette McWilliams', 'John R Mayo', 'John Yee', 'John C English', 'Reka Pataky', 'Emily McPherson', 'Sukhinder Atkar-Khattra', 'Michael R Johnston', 'Heidi Schmidt', 'Frances A Shepherd', 'Kam Soghrati', 'Kayvan Amjadi', 'Paul Burrowes', 'Christian Couture', 'Harmanjatinder S Sekhon', 'Kazuhiro Yasufuku', 'Glenwood Goss', 'Diana N Ionescu', 'David M Hwang', 'Simon Martel', 'Don D Sin', 'Wan C Tan', 'Stefan Urbanski', 'Zhaolin Xu', 'Ming-Sound Tsao', 'Stephen Lam']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Thorac Oncol""","""['The Financial Implications of Lung Cancer Screening: Is It Worth It?', 'Performance and Cost-Effectiveness of Computed Tomography Lung Cancer Screening Scenarios in a Population-Based Setting: A Microsimulation Modeling Analysis in Ontario, Canada.', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Lung Cancer Screening in the United States: A Comparative Modeling Study.', 'Participant selection for lung cancer screening by risk modelling (the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer PanCan study): a single-arm, prospective study.', 'Computed tomography screening for lung cancer in the National Lung Screening Trial: a cost-effectiveness analysis.', 'Current estimate of costs of lung cancer screening in the United States.', 'Real-World Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: How Much Uncertainty Is in the Results?', 'Multi-source data approach for personalized outcome prediction in lung cancer screening: update from the NELSON trial.', 'Estimating time and transportation costs associated with lung cancer screening and diagnostic lung procedures in Taiwan: a cross-sectional survey in a medical centre.', 'Population-Based Screening Using Low-Dose Chest Computed Tomography: A Systematic Review of Health Economic Evaluations.', 'EarlyCDT Lung blood test for risk classification of solid pulmonary nodules: systematic review and economic evaluation.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   Our study included patients enrolled in Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE), a large, prospective, mostly community-based, nationwide PCa registry, who underwent RP between 2004 and 2016.  Intervention:   Open (ORP) versus robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for localized PCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Demographic and clinicopathologic data and surgical outcomes were compared between ORP and RARP. Self-reported, validated questionnaires (scaled 0-100 with higher numbers indicating better function) were used to evaluate urinary and sexual QOL at different time points. Repeated measures mixed-models assessed changes in function and bother over time in each domain.  Results and limitations:   Among 1892 men (n = 1137 ORP; n = 755 RARP), Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score, Gleason grade at biopsy and RP, and pT-stage were lower in ORP patients (all p < 0.01). Men undergoing RARP had comparable surgical margin rates, lymph node yields, and biochemical recurrence rates. In a subset analysis with 1451 men reporting baseline and follow-up QOL data, ORP patients reported superior scores in urinary incontinence (ORP mean ± standard deviation 69 ± 26 vs RARP 62 ± 27) and bother (ORP 75±29 vs RARP 68±28, both p < 0.01) only in the 1st yr after RP.

Limitations include a decrease in the rate of questionnaire response during follow-up, potential selection biases in terms of patient assignment to ORP versus RARP and survey completion rates, and the fact that RARP cases likely included the initial learning curve for the CaPSURE surgeons.  Conclusions:   Most patients experienced changes in urinary and sexual QOL in the 1st 3 yr following RP. The pattern of recovery over time was similar between ORP and RARP groups. Patients should not expect different oncologic or QOL outcomes based on surgical approach.  Patient summary:   Aside from a small, early, and temporary advantage in terms of urinary incontinence and bother favoring open surgery, minimal differences in outcomes are observed when comparing men who undergo open versus robot-assisted prostatectomy in the community setting.""","""['Annika Herlemann', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Matthew R Cooperberg']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Robotic-assisted Radical Prostatectomy for High-risk Cancer: Time for ""Sexta-fecta"".', 'Comparison of oncological and health-related quality of life outcomes between open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localised\xa0prostate cancer - findings from the population-based Victorian Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Superior Biochemical Recurrence and Long-term Quality-of-life Outcomes Are Achievable with Robotic Radical Prostatectomy After a Long Learning Curve-Updated Analysis of a Prospective Single-surgeon Cohort of 2206 Consecutive Cases.', 'Superior quality of life and improved surgical margins are achievable with robotic radical prostatectomy after a long learning curve: a prospective single-surgeon study of 1552 consecutive cases.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Patient-reported outcomes after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and institutional learning curve for functional outcomes.', 'Cost-utility analysis on robot-assisted and laparoscopic prostatectomy based on long-term functional outcomes.', 'Prediction of surgical margin status and location after radical prostatectomy using positive biopsy sites on 12-core standard prostate biopsy.', 'Comparison of urinary and sexual patient-reported outcomes between open radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a propensity score matched, population-based study in Victoria.', 'Prognostic Features of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Following Primary Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Methods and materials:   10 patients had PSMA PET/CT scans prior to prostatectomy. GTV-PET was generated on the basis of an intraprostatic SUVmax of 30%. Two IMRT plans were generated for each patient: Plan77 which consisted of whole-prostate IMRT to 77Gy, and Plan95 which consisted of whole-prostate IMRT to 77Gy and a simultaneous integrated boost to the GTV-PET up to 95Gy (35 fractions). The feasibility of these plans was judged by their ability to adhere to the FLAME trial protocol. TCP-histo/-PET were calculated on co-registered histology (GTV-histo) and GTV-PET, respectively. NTCPs for rectum and bladder were calculated.  Results:   All plans reached prescription doses whilst adhering to dose constraints. In Plan77 and Plan95 mean doses in GTV-histo were 75.8±0.3Gy and 96.9±1Gy, respectively. Average TCP-histo values for Plan77 and Plan95 were 70% (range: 15-97%), and 96% (range: 78-100%, p<0.0001). Average TCP-PET values for Plan77 and Plan95 were 55% (range: 27-82%), and 100% (range: 99-100%, p<0.0001). There was no significant difference between TCP-PET and TCP-histo in Plan95 (p=0.25).

One such drug is Nintedanib; the present study evaluated the effectiveness of Nintedanib treatment against in vitro proliferation of human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, and growth and progression of different grades of PCa lesions in pre-clinical PCa transgenic adenocarcinoma for the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model.  Methods:   Both androgen-independent (LNCaP) and androgen-dependent (PC3) PCa cell lines were treated with a range of Nintedanib doses for 72 h, and effect on cell growth and expression of angiogenesis associated VEGF receptors was analyzed. In pre-clinical efficacy evaluation, male TRAMP mice starting at 8 and 12 weeks of age were orally-fed with vehicle control (10% Tween 20) or Nintedanib (10 mg/Kg/day in vehicle control) for 4 weeks, and sacrificed immediately after 4 weeks of drug treatment or sacrificed 6-10 weeks after stopping drug treatments. At the end of treatment schedule, mice were sacrificed and ventral lobe of prostate was excised along with essential metabolic organ liver, and subjected to histopathological and extensive molecular evaluations.  Results:   The total cell number decreased by 56-80% in LNCaP and 45-93% in PC3 cells after 72 h of Nintedanib treatment at 2.5-25 μM concentrations. In pre-clinical TRAMP studies, Nintedanib led to a delay in tumor progression in all treatment groups; the effect was more pronounced when treatment was given at the beginning of the glandular lesion development and continued till study end. A decreased microvessel density and VEGF immunolocalization was observed, besides decreased expression of Androgen Receptor (AR), VEGFR-1 and FGFR-3 in some of the treated groups. No changes were observed in the histological liver analysis.  Conclusions:   Nintedanib treatment was able to significantly decrease the growth of PCa cell lines and also delay growth and progression of PCa lesions to higher grades of malignancy (without inducing any hepatotoxic effects) in TRAMP mice. Furthermore, it was observed that Nintedanib intervention is more effective when administered during the early stages of neoplastic development, although the drug is capable of reducing cell proliferation even after treatment interruption.""","""['Raquel Frenedoso da Silva', 'Ellen Nogueira-Pangrazi', 'Larissa Akemi Kido', 'Fabio Montico', 'Sarah Arana', 'Dileep Kumar', 'Komal Raina', 'Rajesh Agarwal', 'Valéria Helena Alves Cagnon']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Biomed Sci""","""['Association of anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic therapies negatively influences prostate cancer progression in TRAMP mice.', 'Antiangiogenic therapy with Nintedanib affects hypoxia, angiogenesis and apoptosis in the ventral prostate of TRAMP animals.', 'Nintedanib treatment delays prostate dorsolateral lobe cancer progression in the TRAMP model: contribution to the epithelial-stromal interaction balance.', 'Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model: A good alternative to study PCa progression and chemoprevention approaches.', 'Molecular targets for green tea in prostate cancer prevention.', 'Lobe-specific responses of TRAMP mice dorsolateral prostate following celecoxib and nintedanib therapy.', 'Epithelial Splicing Regulatory Protein (ESPR1) Expression in an Unfavorable Prognostic Factor in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Nintedanib ameliorates animal model of dermatitis.', 'Bone microenvironment signaling of cancer stem cells as a therapeutic target in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Induction of entosis in prostate cancer cells by nintedanib and its therapeutic implications.']"""

However, not all of the circulating cells are tumor cells, as evidenced by a lack of tumor-specific markers. The current FDA standard for capturing CTCs (CellSearch) relies on an epithelial marker and cells captured via CellSearch cannot be considered to have undergone EMT. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain the presence and relevance of any mesenchymal or EMT-like CTCs. To address this gap in technology, we recently discovered the utility of cell-surface vimentin (CSV) as a marker for detecting mesenchymal CTCs from sarcoma, breast, and colon cancer. Here we studied peripheral blood samples of 48 prostate cancer (PCA) patients including hormone sensitive and castration resistant sub-groups. Blood samples were analyzed for three different properties including our own CSV-based CTC enumeration (using 84-1 mAb against CSV), CellSearch-based epithelial CTC counts, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) quantification. Our data demonstrated that in comparison with CellSearch, the CSV-based method had greater sensitivity and specificity. Further, we observed significantly greater numbers of CTCs in castration resistant patients as measured by our CSV method but not CellSearch. Our data suggests CSV-guided CTC enumeration may hold prognostic value and should be further validated as a possible measurement of PCA progression towards the deadly, androgen-independent form.""","""['Arun Satelli', 'Izhar Batth', 'Zachary Brownlee', 'Abhishek Mitra', 'Shouhao Zhou', 'Hyangsoon Noh', 'Christina R Rojas', 'Heming Li', 'Qing H Meng', 'Shulin Li']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Circulating tumor cell enumeration with a combination of epithelial cell adhesion molecule- and cell-surface vimentin-based methods for monitoring breast cancer therapeutic response.', 'Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition leads to disease-stage differences in circulating tumor cell detection and metastasis in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer.', 'Vimentin and Ki67 expression in circulating tumour cells derived from castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition and Circulating Tumor Cells in Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells and Implications of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Cell Surface Vimentin Detection in Cancer Cells by Peptide-Based Monoclonal Antibody.', 'Phenotypic Plasticity in Circulating Tumor Cells Is Associated with Poor Response to Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients.', 'The potential of using circulating tumour cells and their gene expression to predict docetaxel response in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence Based on Molecular Detection of Lymph Node Metastasis After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of circulating tumor cells and CD133 expression on predicting prognosis of thyroid cancer patients.']"""

Uncertainty-experienced by patients or communicated by physician and patient-may be crucial throughout the second opinion process.  Objective:   This study sought to investigate (1) how uncertainty influences men with prostate cancer to seek second opinions and (2) how second opinions may affect these patients' sense of uncertainty and subsequent experiences with their care.  Methods:   A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was performed. Men with localized or advanced prostate cancer (n=23) were interviewed by telephone about their motivations and experiences with seeking second opinions and the uncertainties they experienced. Analysis was performed using the constant comparative method.  Results:   Patients sought second opinions because they were uncertain about receiving too little or biased information, experienced insufficient support in coming to a treatment decision, or because physicians expressed different levels of uncertainty than they did (""unshared uncertainty""). Uncertainty was reduced by the second opinion process for most patients, whereas for others, it increased or was sustained. This evolution depended on the way uncertainty was addressed during the second opinion consultation.  Conclusions:   Second opinions may be a useful tool for some but not all patients.

Objective:   To evaluate the a priori primary hypothesis that combined measurement of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG (T2:ERG) RNA in the urine after digital rectal examination would improve specificity over measurement of prostate-specific antigen alone for detecting cancer with Gleason score of 7 or higher. As a secondary objective, to evaluate the potential effect of such urine RNA testing on health care costs.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective, multicenter diagnostic evaluation and validation in academic and community-based ambulatory urology clinics. Participants were a referred sample of men presenting for first-time prostate biopsy without preexisting prostate cancer: 516 eligible participants from among 748 prospective cohort participants in the developmental cohort and 561 eligible participants from 928 in the validation cohort.  Interventions/exposures:   Urinary PCA3 and T2:ERG RNA measurement before prostate biopsy.  Main outcomes and measures:   Presence of prostate cancer having Gleason score of 7 or higher on prostate biopsy. Pathology testing was blinded to urine assay results. In the developmental cohort, a multiplex decision algorithm was constructed using urine RNA assays to optimize specificity while maintaining 95% sensitivity for predicting aggressive prostate cancer at initial biopsy. Findings were validated in a separate multicenter cohort via prespecified analysis, blinded per prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) criteria. Cost effects of the urinary testing strategy were evaluated by modeling observed biopsy results and previously reported treatment outcomes.  Results:   Among the 516 men in the developmental cohort (mean age, 62 years; range, 33-85 years) combining testing of urinary T2:ERG and PCA3 at thresholds that preserved 95% sensitivity for detecting aggressive prostate cancer improved specificity from 18% to 39%. Among the 561 men in the validation cohort (mean age, 62 years; range, 27-86 years), analysis confirmed improvement in specificity (from 17% to 33%; lower bound of 1-sided 95% CI, 0.73%; prespecified 1-sided P = .04), while high sensitivity (93%) was preserved for aggressive prostate cancer detection. Forty-two percent of unnecessary prostate biopsies would have been averted by using the urine assay results to select men for biopsy. Cost analysis suggested that this urinary testing algorithm to restrict prostate biopsy has greater potential cost-benefit in younger men.

While discussions about advantages and disadvantages of testing are a feature of patient-centered care, it is unclear how provider recommendations and the presence of a personal doctor influence testing in the presence of such discussions.  Materials and methods:   We used the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify 1,737 male respondents surveyed about their PSA testing decisions. We describe the prevalence of provider recommendations and utilize weighted multivariable logistic regression models to examine the impact of provider recommendations and presence of a personal doctor on routine testing while accounting for patient-provider discussions about advantages and disadvantages.  Results:   The majority (70.4%) of respondents reported some form of discussion with providers about testing and most underwent screening in accordance with provider recommendations. In multivariable analyses, men whose providers had never recommended PSA test were less likely to receive screening [OR 0.03, 95% CI (0.02-0.05)], and patients who did not identify a personal doctor in their care were less likely to undergo testing [OR 0.12, 95% CI (0.04-0.32)].  Discussion:   Provider recommendations and having a personal doctor are associated with routine PSA testing. These findings suggest that providers and policymakers should be aware of how the content and context of communication with patients, beyond discussions of risks and benefits, can influence routine PSA testing behaviors.""","""['Joshua M Liao', 'Mark J Ommerborn', 'Cheryl R Clark']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Do Men Receive Information Required for Shared Decision Making About PSA Testing?

The surface of TiONts is linked with 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane and with a hetero-bifunctional polymer (polyethylene glycol) to create well-dispersed and biocompatible nanovectors. The prefunctionalized surface of this scaffold has valuable attachments to graft therapeutic agents (DTX in our case) as well as chelating agents (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) to monitor the nanohybrids. To evaluate drug efficacy, in vitro tests have demonstrated that the association between TiONts and DTX shows cytotoxic activity against a hormone-refractory prostate cancer cell line (22Rv1) whereas TiONts without DTX do not. Finally, the first in vivo tests with intratumoral injections show that more than 70% of TiONts nanovectors are retained within the tumor for at least 7 d. Moreover, tumor growth in mice receiving TiONts-DTX is significantly slower than that in mice receiving free DTX. This nanohybrid can thus become a promising new tool in biomedicine to fight against prostate cancer.""","""['Alexis Loiseau', 'Julien Boudon', 'Céline Mirjolet', 'Gilles Créhange', 'Nadine Millot']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Adv Healthc Mater""","""['About the Influence of PEG Spacers on the Cytotoxicity of Titanate Nanotubes-Docetaxel Nanohybrids against a Prostate Cancer Cell Line.', 'Docetaxel-titanate nanotubes enhance radiosensitivity in an androgen-independent prostate cancer model.', 'Titanate Nanotubes Engineered with Gold Nanoparticles and Docetaxel to Enhance Radiotherapy on Xenografted Prostate Tumors.', 'Tumor targetability and antitumor effect of docetaxel-loaded hydrophobically modified glycol chitosan nanoparticles.', 'Metallic and metal oxide-derived nanohybrid as a tool for biomedical applications.', 'In vivo protein corona on nanoparticles: does the control of all material parameters orient the biological behavior?', 'Polymer-Based Hybrid Nanoarchitectures for Cancer Therapy Applications.', 'Radiation nanosensitizers in cancer therapy-From preclinical discoveries to the outcomes of early clinical trials.', 'About the Influence of PEG Spacers on the Cytotoxicity of Titanate Nanotubes-Docetaxel Nanohybrids against a Prostate Cancer Cell Line.', 'Assessment of Pharmacokinetics, Toxicity, and Biodistribution of a High Dose of Titanate Nanotubes Following Intravenous Injection in Mice: A Promising Nanosystem of Medical Interest.']"""

Methods:   Five hundred and eighteen patients undergoing HoLEP (n = 289) or TURP (n = 229) were retrospectively analyzed for total PSA, prostate volume, PSA density, history of prostate biopsy, resected prostate weight, and histopathological features. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify independent predictors of incidental PCa (iPCa).  Results:   Men undergoing HoLEP had a significantly higher total PSA (median 5.5 vs. 2.3 ng/mL) and prostate volume (median 80 vs. 41 cc), and displayed a greater reduction of prostate volume after surgery compared to TURP patients (median 71 vs. 50%; all p < 0.001). With a prevalence of incidental PCa (iPCa) of 15 and 17% for HoLEP and TURP, respectively, the choice of procedure had no influence on the detection of iPCa (p = 0.593). However, a higher rate of false-negative preoperative prostate biopsies was noted among iPCa patients in the HoLEP arm (40 vs. 8%, p = 0.007). In multivariate logistic regression, we identified patient age (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.07, p = 0.013) and PSA density (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.09-4.18, p = 0.028) as independent predictors for the detection of iPCa.  Conclusions:   Despite differences in oncologic parameters, the choice of technique had no influence on the detection of iPCa. Increased patient age and higher PSA density were associated with iPCa. A higher rate of false-negative preoperative prostate biopsies was noted in HoLEP patients. Therefore, diagnostic assessment of LUTS patients requires a more adapted approach to exclude malignancy, especially in those with larger prostates.""","""['Annika Herlemann', 'Kerstin Wegner', 'Alexander Roosen', 'Alexander Buchner', 'Philipp Weinhold', 'Alexander Bachmann', 'Christian G Stief', 'Christian Gratzke', 'Giuseppe Magistro']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Relationships between holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and prostate cancer.', 'HoLEP provides a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to bipolar TURP: a matched-pair analysis.', '""In-bore"" MRI prostate biopsy is a safe preoperative clinical tool to exclude significant prostate cancer in symptomatic patients with benign prostatic obstruction before transurethral laser enucleation.', 'The significance of a high preoperative PSA level for the detection of incidental prostate cancer in LUTS patients with large prostates.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Transurethral Procedures for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Resulting from Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Update.', 'Current Trends in Incidence and Management of T1a and T1b Prostate Cancer.', 'Relationships between holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and prostate cancer.', 'The significance of the extent of tissue embedding for the detection of incidental prostate carcinoma on transurethral prostate resection material: the more, the better?', 'Incidental prostate cancer after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate: incidence and predictive factors for clinical progression.', 'Prevalence and risk factors for incidental prostate cancer in patients after transurethral resection of the prostate with negative results on prostate biopsy: A retrospective study.']"""

Whether a biological basis exists for this disparity remains unclear. Exome sequencing (n = 102) and targeted validation (n = 90) of localized primary hormone-naïve prostate cancer in African-American men identified several gene mutations not previously observed in this context, including recurrent loss-of-function mutations in ERF, an ETS transcriptional repressor, in 5% of cases. Analysis of existing prostate cancer cohorts revealed ERF deletions in 3% of primary prostate cancers and mutations or deletions in ERF in 3% to 5% of lethal castration-resistant prostate cancers. Knockdown of ERF confers increased anchorage-independent growth and generates a gene expression signature associated with oncogenic ETS activation and androgen signaling. Together, these results suggest that ERF is a prostate cancer tumor-suppressor gene. More generally, our findings support the application of systematic cancer genomic characterization in settings of broader ancestral diversity to enhance discovery and, eventually, therapeutic applications.Significance: Systematic genomic sequencing of prostate cancer in African-American men revealed new insights into prostate cancer, including the identification of ERF as a prostate cancer gene; somatic copy-number alteration differences; and uncommon PIK3CA and PTEN alterations.

There is a need for more data about SBRT, especially in high-risk PCa patients. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the safety and the short-term efficacy of robotic SBRT in a clinical patient cohort with localized PCa including also high-risk patients (D'Amico risk stratification).  Materials and methods:   A total of 240 consecutive patients with clinically localized PCa were treated primarily with SBRT to total doses of 35 Gy or 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions using a robotic SBRT device (CyberKnife®). All risk groups (D'Amico risk stratification) were represented as follows: 48 (22%), 59 (27%) and 111 (51%) of the patients representing low-, intermediate- and high-risk group, respectively. Data on acute and intermediate-term toxicities and early PSA responses were analyzed.  Results:   Neither acute grade 3 or higher GU nor rectal toxicity was observed. Regardless of the fact that 29 (13.3%) patients experienced intermediate-term toxicity requiring diagnostic interventions, the rates of intermediate-term grade 3 GU, rectal and infectious toxicity were low, 1.8%, 0.9% and 1.4%, respectively. A biochemical relapse was observed in ten (4.6%) patients. With the median follow-up time of 23 months the biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) rate was 100%, 96.6% and 92.8% in low-, intermediate- and high-risk group, respectively.

However, adverse cardiovascular events including heart failure can limit therapeutic use. Istaroxime, which combines Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA) inhibition with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) stimulation, has recently shown promising anti-neoplastic effects in prostate cancer (PC) models and may also improve cardiac function. Considering the promising anticancer effects of istaroxime, we aimed to assess its functional effects on human myocardium.  Results:   Istaroxime and strophanthidin elicited dose-dependent positive inotropic effects with a decline in developed force at supraphysiological concentrations in human atrial, nonfailing, and failing ventricular (ToF) myocardium. Diastolic force and RT50% did not change after exposure to both drugs. The maximal developed force in our in-vitro model of heart failure (ToF) was significantly higher after istaroxime administration. Such a difference did not occur in atrial or nonfailing ventricular trabeculae and was not applicable to the diastolic force.  Materials and methods:   Human atrial and ventricular trabeculae were isolated from nonfailing hearts and hearts of infants with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), which were used as an in-vitro model of heart failure. The samples were electrically stimulated and treated with increasing concentrations of istaroxime and strophanthidin (10 nM-1 μM). Systolic and diastolic force development and relaxation parameters (RT50%) were analyzed.

Materials and Methods A decision-analysis model was created for biopsy-naive men who had been recommended for prostate biopsy on the basis of abnormal digital rectal examination results or elevated prostate-specific antigen levels (age groups: 41-50 years, 51-60 years, and 61-70 years). The following three major strategies were evaluated: (a) standard transrectal ultrasonography (US)-guided biopsy; (b) diagnostic MR imaging followed by MR imaging-targeted biopsy, with no biopsy performed if MR imaging findings were negative; and (c) diagnostic MR imaging followed by MR imaging-targeted biopsy, with a standard biopsy performed when MR imaging findings were negative. The following three MR imaging-guided biopsy strategies were further evaluated in each MR imaging category: (a) biopsy with cognitive guidance, (b) biopsy with MR imaging/US fusion guidance, and (c) in-gantry MR imaging-guided biopsy. Model parameters were derived from the literature. The primary outcome measure was net health benefit (NHB), which was measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained or lost by investing resources in a new strategy compared with a standard strategy at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50 000 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed by using Monte Carlo simulations. Results Noncontrast MR imaging followed by cognitively guided MR biopsy (no standard biopsy if MR imaging findings were negative) was the most cost-effective approach, yielding an additional NHB of 0.198 QALY compared with the standard biopsy approach. Noncontrast MR imaging followed by in-gantry MR imaging-guided biopsy (no standard biopsy if MR imaging findings were negative) led to the highest NHB gain of 0.251 additional QALY compared with the standard biopsy strategy. All MR imaging strategies were cost-effective in 94.05% of Monte Carlo simulations. Analysis by age groups yielded similar results.

In vitro experiments using human cell lines have shown hypothermia provides a radioprotective effect that becomes more pronounced at large, single-fraction doses common to stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatments. This work describes the development of a system to evaluate local hypothermia for a radioprotective effect of the rat rectum during a large dose of radiation relevant to prostate SBRT. This includes the evaluation of a 3D-printed small animal rectal cooling device and the integration with a small animal irradiator.  Methods:   A 3-cm long, dual-lumen rectal temperature control apparatus (RTCA) was designed in SOLIDWORKS CAD for 3D printing. The RTCA was capable of recirculating flow in a device small enough for insertion into the rat rectum, with a metal support rod for strength as well as visibility during radiation treatment planning. The outer walls of the RTCA comprised of thin heat shrink plastic, achieving efficient heat transfer into adjacent tissues. Following leak-proof testing, fiber optic temperature probes were used to evaluate the temperature over time when placed adjacent to the cooling device within the rat rectum. MRI thermometry characterized the relative temperature distribution in concentric ROIs surrounding the probe. Integration with an image-guided small animal irradiator and associated treatment planning system included evaluation for imaging artifacts and effect of brass tubing on dose calculation.  Results:   The rectal temperature adjacent to the cooling device decreased from body temperature to 15°C within 10-20 min from device insertion and was maintained at 15 ± 3°C during active cooling for the evaluated time of one hour. MR thermometry revealed a steep temperature gradient with increasing distance from the cooling device with the desired temperature range maintained within the surrounding few millimeters.  Conclusions:   A 3D-printed rectal cooling device was fabricated for the purpose of inducing local hypothermia in the rat rectum. The RTCA was simply integrated with an image-guided small animal irradiator and Monte Carlo-based treatment planning system to facilitate an in vivo investigation of the radioprotective effect of hypothermia for late rectal toxicity following a single large dose of radiation.""","""['Brian A Hrycushko', 'Chenchen Bing', 'Cecil Futch', 'Michelle Wodzak', 'Strahinja Stojadinovic', 'Paul M Medin', 'Rajiv Chopra']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Local Hypothermia as a Radioprotector of the Rectal Wall During Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.', 'Dosimetric implications of an injection of hyaluronic acid for preserving the rectal wall in prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy.', ""Local cerebral hypothermia induced by selective infusion of cold lactated ringer's: a feasibility study in rhesus monkeys."", 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in a previously radiated patient with polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacing to reduce rectal dose: case report and review of the literature.', 'The Effect of Low Temperatures on Environmental Radiation Damage in Living Systems: Does Hypothermia Show Promise for Space Travel?']"""

A literature search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) databases was conducted. In all of the included studies, the diagnostic accuracy of SWE was compared with that of histopathology, which was used as a standard. Data were pooled, and the sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated to estimate the accuracy of SWE. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of PCa by SWE were 0.844 (95% confidence interval: 0.696-0.927) and 0.860 (0.792-0.908), respectively. The AUC was 0.91 (0.89-0.94), the PLR was 6.017 (3.674-9.853), and the NLR was 0.182 (0.085-0.389). The DOR was 33.069 (10.222-106.982).

Prominent drugs being Cyproterone acetate, Flutamide, Bicalutamide, they not only cause acute and long-term toxicity, but also develops drug resistance among patients. Our focus has been on phytochemicals which do not exhibit any cytotoxicity and have significant androgen receptor (AR) inhibition activity. As Protein- Ligand interactions play a key role in structure based drug design, so by using molecular docking, we screened 803 phytochemicals and investigated their binding affinity against AR. The three dimensional (3D) structure of AR was retrieved from Protein Data Bank, and docked with 3D Pubchem structures of 803 phytochemicals using Argus Lab. Molecular docking and drug likeness studies were made using ADMET properties while Lipinski's rule of five was performed for the phytochemicals to evaluate their anti-prostate cancer activity. The results showed that Isobavachin exhibited best binding affinity of -13.73 kcal/mol with AR followed by Glabranin, Anthocyanin and Eriosemation.

Although myeloid-derived cells have the ability to suppress T-cell function, little is known about the direct impact of these innate cells on prostate tumor growth. Here, it is reported that granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are the predominant tumor-infiltrating cells in prostate cancer xenografts established in athymic nude mice. MDSCs significantly increased in number in the peripheral circulation as a function of xenograft growth and were successfully depleted in vivo by Gr-1 antibody treatment. Importantly, MDSC depletion significantly decreased xenograft growth. We hypothesized that granulocytic MDSCs might exert their protumorigenic actions in part through neutrophil elastase (ELANE), a serine protease released upon granulocyte activation. Indeed, it was determined that NE is expressed by infiltrating immune cells and is enzymatically active in prostate cancer xenografts and in prostate tumors of prostate-specific Pten-null mice. Importantly, treatment with sivelestat, a small-molecule inhibitor specific for NE, significantly decreased xenograft growth, recapitulating the phenotype of Gr-1 MDSC depletion. Mechanistically, NE activated MAPK signaling and induced MAPK-dependent transcription of the proliferative gene cFOS in prostate cancer cells. Functionally, NE stimulated proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro IHC on human prostate cancer clinical biopsies revealed coexpression of NE and infiltrating CD33+ MDSCs.Implications: This report suggests that MDSCs and NE are physiologically important mediators of prostate cancer progression and may serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

In this study, we assessed how hemin, a pharmacologic inducer of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), has an impact on prostate cancer development in an in vivo conditioning model.Experimental Design: The stroma of C57BL/6 mice was conditioned by subcutaneous administration of hemin prior to TRAMP-C1 tumor challenge. Complementary in vitro and in vivo assays were performed to evaluate hemin effect on both angiogenesis and the immune response. To gain clinical insight, we used prostate cancer patient-derived samples in our studies to assess the expression of HO-1 and other relevant genes.Results: Conditioning resulted in increased tumor latency and decreased initial growth rate. Histologic analysis of tumors grown in conditioned mice revealed impaired vascularization. Hemin-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exhibited decreased tubulogenesis in vitro only in the presence of TRAMP-C1-conditioned media. Subcutaneous hemin conditioning hindered tumor-associated neovascularization in an in vivo Matrigel plug assay. In addition, hemin boosted CD8+ T-cell proliferation and degranulation in vitro and antigen-specific cytotoxicity in vivo A significant systemic increase in CD8+ T-cell frequency was observed in preconditioned tumor-bearing mice. Tumors from hemin-conditioned mice showed reduced expression of galectin-1 (Gal-1), key modulator of tumor angiogenesis and immunity, evidencing persistent remodeling of the microenvironment. We also found a subset of prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts and prostate cancer patient samples with mild HO-1 and low Gal-1 expression levels.Conclusions: These results highlight a novel function of a human-used drug as a means of boosting the antitumor response.

We recently showed that IDC shares a clonal ancestry with the adjacent glandular adenocarcinoma.  Objective:   We investigated for the co-occurrence of ""aggression"" factors, genomic instability and hypoxia, and performed gene expression profiling of these tumors.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 1325 men were treated for localized prostate cancer from four academic institutions (University Health Network, CHU de Québec-Université Laval, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC], and Erasmus Medical Center). Pathological specimens were centrally reviewed. Gene copy number and expression, and intraprostatic oxygenation were assessed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   IDC/CA was separately assessed for biochemical relapse risk in the Canadian and MSKCC cohorts. Both cohorts were pooled for analyses on metastasis.  Results and limitation:   Presence of IDC/CA independently predicted for increased risks of biochemical relapse (HRCanadian 2.17, p<0.001; HRMSKCC 2.32, p=0.0035) and metastasis (HRpooled 3.31, p<0.001). IDC/CA+ cancers were associated with an increased percentage of genome alteration (PGA [median] 7.2 vs 3.0, p<0.001), and hypoxia (64.0% vs 45.5%, p=0.17). Combinatorial genomic-pathological indices offered the strongest discrimination for metastasis (C-index 0.805 [clinical+IDC/CA+PGA] vs 0.786 [clinical+IDC/CA] vs 0.761 [clinical]). Profiling of mRNA abundance revealed that long noncoding RNA, SChLAP1, was the only gene expressed at >3-fold higher (p<0.0001) in IDC/CA+ than in IDC/CA- tumors, independently corroborated by increased SChLAP1 RNA in situ hybridization signal. Optimal treatment intensification for IDC/CA+ prostate cancer requires prospective testing.  Conclusions:   The poor outcome associated with IDC and CA subpathologies is associated with a constellation of genomic instability, SChLAP1 expression, and hypoxia. We posit a novel concept in IDC/CA+ prostate cancer, ""nimbosus"" (gathering of stormy clouds, Latin), which manifests as increased metastatic capacity and lethality.

INhibitor of Growth (ING) proteins target lysine acetyltransferase or lysine deacetylase complexes to the histone H3K4Me3 mark of active transcription, to affect chromatin structure and gene expression. ING3 is a stoichiometric member of the TIP60 lysine acetyltransferase complex implicated in prostate cancer development.  Methods:   Biopsies of 265 patients with prostate cancer were stained for ING3, pan-cytokeratin, and DNA. LNCaP and C4-2 androgen-responsive cells were used for in vitro assays including immunoprecipitation, western blotting, Luciferase reporter assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell viability and migration assays were performed in prostate cancer cell lines using scrambled siRNA or siRNA targeting ING3.  Results:   We find that ING3 levels and AR activity positively correlate in prostate cancer. ING3 potentiates androgen effects, increasing expression of androgen-regulated genes and androgen response element-driven reporters to promote growth and anchorage-independent growth. Conversely, ING3 knockdown inhibits prostate cancer cell growth and invasion. ING3 activates the AR by serving as a scaffold to increase interaction between TIP60 and the AR in the cytoplasm, enhancing receptor acetylation and translocation to the nucleus. Activation is independent of ING3's ability to target the TIP60 complex to H3K4Me3, identifying a previously unknown chromatin-independent cytoplasmic activity for ING3. In agreement with in vitro observations, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data (n = 498) and a prostate cancer tissue microarray (n = 256) show that ING3 levels are higher in aggressive prostate cancers, with high levels of ING3 predicting shorter patient survival in a low AR subgroup. Including ING3 levels with currently used indicators such as the Gleason score provides more accurate prognosis in primary prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   In contrast to the majority of previous reports suggesting tumor suppressive functions in other cancers, our observations identify a clear oncogenic role for ING3, which acts as a co-activator of AR in prostate cancer. Data from TCGA and our previous and current tissue microarrays suggest that ING3 levels correlate with AR levels and that in patients with low levels of the receptor, ING3 level could serve as a useful prognostic biomarker.""","""['Arash Nabbi', 'Urszula L McClurg', 'Subhash Thalappilly', 'Amal Almami', 'Mahsa Mobahat', 'Tarek A Bismar', 'Olivier Binda', 'Karl T Riabowol']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Med""","""['ING Tumour Suppressors and ING Splice Variants as Coregulators of the Androgen Receptor Signalling in Prostate Cancer.', 'ING3 is associated with increased cell invasion and lethal outcome in ERG-negative prostate cancer patients.', 'A Novel Splice Variant of the Inhibitor of Growth 3 Lacks the Plant Homeodomain and Regulates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Tip60 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation by translocation of androgen receptor into the nucleus.', 'Metabolic Roles of Androgen Receptor and Tip60 in Androgen-Dependent Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of ING3 expression in patients with cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Molecular mechanisms of inhibitor of growth (ING) family members in health and malignancy.', 'Inhibitor of Growth Factors Regulate Cellular Senescence.', 'EpCAM as a Novel Biomarker for Survivals in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'ING Tumour Suppressors and ING Splice Variants as Coregulators of the Androgen Receptor Signalling in Prostate Cancer.']"""

A PSA decline >50 and >90% was observed in 24/31 patients and 17/31 patients, respectively. In 19/31 patients even a complete biochemical response was observed. 10/31 patients received further PC-specific treatment after a median of 125 days following 111In-PSMA-RGS. Surgery-related complications were observed in 10 patients (Clavien-Dindo classification: grade 1 n=6, grade 3b n=4). 111In-PSMA-RGS seems to be highly valuable for the intraoperative detection of small metastatic lesions in PC patients scheduled for salvage lymphadenectomy.

We evaluated associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 25 stemness-related genes with prostate cancer risk in 1,609 cases and 2,550 controls of non-Hispanic whites (4,934 SNPs) and 1,144 cases and 1,116 controls of African descendants (5,448 SNPs) with correction by false discovery rate ≤0.2. We identified 32 SNPs in five genes (TP63, ALDH1A1, WNT1, MET and EGFR) that were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk, of which six SNPs in three genes (TP63, ALDH1A1 and WNT1) and eight EGFR SNPs showed heterogeneity in susceptibility between these two racial groups. In addition, 13 SNPs in MET and one in ALDH1A1 were found only in African descendants. The in silico bioinformatics analyses revealed that EGFR rs2072454 and SNPs in linkage with the identified SNPs in MET and ALDH1A1 (r2 > 0.6) were predicted to regulate RNA splicing.

Although involvement of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in cancer progression is long established, the molecular mechanisms leading to differentiation of CAFs from normal fibroblasts are poorly understood. Here, we report that kallikrein-related peptidase-4 (KLK4) promotes CAF differentiation. KLK4 is highly expressed in prostate epithelial cells of premalignant (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and malignant lesions compared to normal prostate epithelia, especially at the peristromal interface. KLK4 induced CAF-like features in the prostate-derived WPMY1 normal stromal cell line, including increased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, ESR1 and SFRP1. KLK4 activated protease-activated receptor-1 in WPMY1 cells increasing expression of several factors (FGF1, TAGLN, LOX, IL8, VEGFA) involved in prostate cancer progression. In addition, KLK4 induced WPMY1 cell proliferation and secretome changes, which in turn stimulated HUVEC cell proliferation that could be blocked by a VEGFA antibody. Importantly, the genes dysregulated by KLK4 treatment of WPMY1 cells were also differentially expressed between patient-derived CAFs compared to matched nonmalignant fibroblasts and were further increased by KLK4 treatment. Taken together, we propose that epithelial-derived KLK4 promotes tumour progression by actively promoting CAF differentiation in the prostate stromal microenvironment.""","""['Thomas Kryza', 'Lakmali M Silva', 'Nathalie Bock', 'Ruth A Fuhrman-Luck', 'Carson R Stephens', 'Jin Gao', 'Hema Samaratunga;Australian Prostate Cancer BioResource;Mitchell G Lawrence', 'John D Hooper', 'Ying Dong', 'Gail P Risbridger', 'Judith A Clements']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Kallikrein-related peptidase-4 initiates tumor-stroma interactions in prostate cancer through protease-activated receptor-1.', 'Kallikrein-related peptidase 4 (KLK4) initiates intracellular signaling via protease-activated receptors (PARs).

This has increased the diagnostic accuracy of prostate cancer worldwide.  Materials and methods:   In this prospective study, total of 50 cases including 37 cases of malignant lesions and 13 cases of benign lesions of the prostate were taken. Tumor grade was determined according to Gleason's grading system. AMACR and HMWCK expressions were determined by immunohistochemical staining. The obtained results were analyzed and evaluated using Chi-square statistical test (SPSS version 20).  Results:   AMACR was not expressed in any of the 13 cases of benign lesions of the prostate while in malignant lesions of prostate it was expressed in 33 of 37 (89.18%) cases. All 4 (100%) cases of well-differentiated carcinoma were positive for AMACR expression. 21 of 25 (84%) moderately differentiated and all 10 (100%) cases of poorly differentiated tumors were positive for AMACR. There was statistically significant difference in expression of AMACR between benign and malignant lesions of the prostate, indicated byP = 0.001. In benign lesions, HMWCK was expressed in all the 13 (100%) cases while in malignant lesions of prostate it was not expressed in any of the (0%) case. All 13 benign lesions were positive for HMWCK only. AMACR expression was not seen in any of the benign lesion. Out of 37 malignant cases, 4 cases were negative for both, 33 cases were positive only for AMACR, but no case was positive only for HMWCK.

Magnetic resonance images of the prostate acquired before IRE were fused with transrectal ultrasound images acquired during IRE. The position of the ultrasound probe was tracked via a sensor and corresponding magnetic resonance images were calculated in real-time. While MRI allowed delineation of the target volume, the position of the electrodes could be visualized on ultrasound images; the distance between individual electrode pairs was measured. Based on these measurements the software installed on the IRE unit was able to calculate the voltage necessary to generate the electric field for ablation. Using contrast-enhanced ultrasound, changes in perfusion within the ablation zone after IRE were documented. This technique allowed positioning of the electrodes around the target volume under image guidance in all patients treated with IRE. The target lesion and a safety margin were covered within the estimated ablation zone.

At any follow-up, or ""landmark"", time, the residual time distribution for an individual, conditional on their updated marker values, can be used to produce a dynamic prediction. To satisfy a consistency condition that links dynamic predictions at different time points, the residual time distribution must follow from a prediction function that models the joint distribution of the marker process and time to failure, such as a joint model. To circumvent the assumptions and computational burden associated with a joint model, approximate methods for dynamic prediction have been proposed. One such method is landmarking, which fits a Cox model at a sequence of landmark times, and thus is not a comprehensive probability model of the marker process and the event time. Considering an illness-death model, we derive the residual time distribution and demonstrate that the structure of the Cox model baseline hazard and covariate effects under the landmarking approach do not have simple form. We suggest some extensions of the landmark Cox model that should provide a better approximation. We compare the performance of the landmark models with joint models using simulation studies and cognitive aging data from the PAQUID study.

Methods:   Twenty-seven consecutive patients were subjected to 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (1 h p.i.) followed by PET/MRI (3 h p.i.). PET/MRI was first started with scans of the abdomen to pelvis with arms positioned up above the head. Immediately thereafter, additional scans from the pelvis to abdomen were conducted with arms positioned down beside the trunk. All investigations were first analyzed separately and then compared with respect to tumor detection and tumor uptake (SUV) as well as the presence and intensity of the halo artifact. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine statistical differences including Bonferroni correction.  Results:   The halo was significantly reduced if the arms were elevated. Lesions inside the halo artifact (n = 16) demonstrated significantly increased SUVmean (p = 0.0007) and SUVmax (p = 0.0024) with arms positioned up. The halo appearance and intensity was not dependent on the total activity and activity concentration of the urinary bladder.  Conclusion:   Positioning the arms down was shown to be significantly associated with the appearance of the halo artifact in PET/MRI.

This knowledge gap has thus limited the ability to treat cancer. Here, it is demonstrated that androgens increase the metabolism of glutamine in prostate cancer cells. This metabolism was required for maximal cell growth under conditions of serum starvation. Mechanistically, AR signaling promoted glutamine metabolism by increasing the expression of the glutamine transporters SLC1A4 and SLC1A5, genes commonly overexpressed in prostate cancer. Correspondingly, gene expression signatures of AR activity correlated with SLC1A4 and SLC1A5 mRNA levels in clinical cohorts. Interestingly, MYC, a canonical oncogene in prostate cancer and previously described master regulator of glutamine metabolism, was only a context-dependent regulator of SLC1A4 and SLC1A5 levels, being unable to regulate either transporter in PTEN wild-type cells. In contrast, rapamycin was able to decrease the androgen-mediated expression of SLC1A4 and SLC1A5 independent of PTEN status, indicating that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) was needed for maximal AR-mediated glutamine uptake and prostate cancer cell growth. Taken together, these data indicate that three well-established oncogenic drivers (AR, MYC, and mTOR) function by converging to collectively increase the expression of glutamine transporters, thereby promoting glutamine uptake and subsequent prostate cancer cell growth.Implications: AR, MYC, and mTOR converge to increase glutamine uptake and metabolism in prostate cancer through increasing the levels of glutamine transporters.

A Pooled Analysis of NIH-AARP and PLCO Cohorts""","""Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in U.S. men. There is an unmet need to identify modifiable risk factors for prostate cancer survival. Experimental studies have suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may improve prostate cancer survival through antithrombotic and anti-inflammation mechanisms. Results from previous observational studies have been equivocal, and few have assessed whether an etiologically relevant time window of exposure exists. We sampled incident prostate cancer cases from two large U.S. prospective cohorts, NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study and PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, to investigate whether pre- and postdiagnostic aspirin and non-aspirin NSAID use were associated with prostate cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Study-specific results were meta-analyzed using fixed-effects models. Pre- and postdiagnostic aspirin or non-aspirin NSAID use were not statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality. However, occasional (less than daily) and daily aspirin users five years or more before prostate cancer diagnosis had 18% (HR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.75-0.90) and 15% (HR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94) reduced all-cause mortality versus nonusers. Similarly, postdiagnostic occasional and daily aspirin use were associated with 17% (HR = 0.83; 95% CI=0.72-0.95) and 25% (HR = 0.75; 95% CI = 0.66-0.86) reduced all-cause mortality, independent of prediagnostic aspirin use. This study suggests that aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs are not associated with prostate cancer survival. However, aspirin use both before and after prostate cancer diagnosis was associated with longer overall survival, highlighting the importance of comorbidity prevention among prostate cancer survivors.

We aimed at providing contemporary data on incidence and survival figures of de-novo NEPC.  Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we identified 309 individuals with de-novo NEPC diagnosed between 2004 and 2013. We evaluated age-adjusted incidence rates over the study. Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed overall survival (OS) after stratification according to histologic subtype, metastatic status, and treatment. Cox regression analyses tested the predictors of overall mortality, after adjusting for confounders.  Results:   A total of 309 cases of NEPC were identified from 510,913 cases of prostate cancer. Metastatic disease was identified in 198 (64.1%) cases. The most common histologic subtype (n = 186; 60.2%) was small-cell carcinoma (SCC). The age-adjusted incidence of NEPC significantly increased over the study span. However, this increase only affected SCC (from 0.13/1,000,000 person-years in 2004 to 0.30/1,000,000 person-years in 2013; P = .001). Median survival for NEPC was 10 months. After stratification by metastatic status, no difference was observed according to SCC versus non-SCC. Treatment with radical prostatectomy improved OS only among individuals with non-metastatic disease, whereas radiation therapy did not affect OS rates. In multivariable Cox regression analyses predicting overall mortality, metastatic stage (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.06; P < .01) and radical prostatectomy (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.74; P < .01) achieved independent predictor status.  Conclusion:   De-novo NEPC is extremely rare and will be encountered in clinical practice by few urologists. Most cases are metastatic at diagnosis.

This study intended to examine the parameters influencing anxiety related to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PC in long-term survivors after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   We surveyed 4719 PC survivors from the German multicenter prospective database ""Familial Prostate Cancer."" We evaluated the association of PC-related anxiety (MAX-PC) with sociodemographic characteristics, family history of PC, global health status/quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), depression and anxiety (PHQ-2; GAD-2), latest PSA level, time since radical prostatectomy, and current therapy.  Results:   The survey participants' mean age was 75.2 years (SD = 6.5). Median follow-up was 11.5 years, and 19.5% of participants had survived more than 15 years since the initial treatment. The final regression analysis found that younger age, lower global health status/quality of life, higher depression and anxiety scores, higher latest PSA level, and shorter time since radical prostatectomy predicted increased PSA-related anxiety and PC anxiety. Familial PC was predictive only of PSA anxiety (all p < 0.05). The final model explained 12% of the variance for PSA anxiety and 24% for PC anxiety.  Conclusions:   PC-related anxiety remained relevant many years after prostatectomy and was influenced by younger age, psychological status, rising PSA level, and shorter time since initial treatment.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Survivors with these characteristics are at increased risk of PC-related anxieties, which should be considered by the treating physician during follow-up.""","""['Valentin H Meissner', 'Kathleen Herkommer', 'Birgitt Marten-Mittag', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Andreas Dinkel']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['Prostate cancer-related anxiety among long-term survivors after radical prostatectomy: A longitudinal study.', 'Health-related quality of life in long-term prostate cancer survivors after nerve-sparing and non-nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy-Results from the multiregional PROCAS study.', 'Evaluation of the association of prostate cancer-specific anxiety with sexual function, depression and cancer aggressiveness in men 1 year following surgical treatment for localized prostate cancer.', 'Patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires for men who have radical surgery for prostate cancer: a conceptual review of existing instruments.', 'Health-related quality of life among long-term (≥5\xa0years) prostate cancer survivors by primary intervention: a systematic review.', 'Benefit finding in men affected by prostate cancer prior to and following radical prostatectomy - a cross-sectional study with a stratified sample.', 'Time without PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy as a predictor of future biochemical recurrence, metastatic disease and prostate cancer death: a prospective Scandinavian cohort study.', ""'Is it painful'?

We aimed to assess cancer incidence in miners relative to the general population and identify high-risk subgroups.  Methods:   Incident cancers in Western Australian miners (n=153,922; 86% male) during 1996-2013 were identified. Indirectly standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated and mixed-effects Poisson models were used to calculate Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs) to identify high-risk within-cohort subgroups.  Results:   Compared with the general population, the overall cancer incidence in miners (n=4194 cases) was lower for both females (SIR:0.83, 95%CI:0.74-0.92) and males (SIR:0.96, 95%CI:0.93-0.99). Overall, cancer incidence did not differ by employment duration or employment commencement time. Ever-underground work was associated with lung cancer (IRR:1.81, 95%CI:1.11-2.93). Relative to multi-ore miners, IRRs for specific cancers were significantly different when exclusively mining: iron (prostate:0.73, 95%CI:0.56-0.94); gold (lung:1.77, 95%CI:1.04-3.01 and colorectum:1.70, 95%CI:1.16-2.51); and other metals (urinary tract:1.85, 95%CI:1.03-3.31 and leukaemia:0.36, 95%CI:0.14-0.96).  Conclusion:   Working underground emerged as a significant determinant of lung cancer risk in our contemporary mining cohort. Increased risks of lung, prostate, colorectal and urinary tract cancers and leukaemia were identified in miners of specific ores.

In order to evaluate this benchmark, we analyzed (in 2016/Boston) screening prevalence of breast cancer, a recommended screening test according to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and prostate cancer, for which screening is no longer recommended by the USPSTF, among traditional Medicare beneficiaries and those enrolled in ACOs. We used propensity-score weighting to adjust for baseline confounders. We found that the prevalence of breast cancer screening (35.0% vs. 25.2%, p<0.001) and prostate cancer screening (54.6% vs. 41.7%, p<0.001) is higher among ACO enrollees.

This continues to pose a tremendous challenge in diagnosis and prognosis of PCa and could potentially lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment complications. Copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome have been linked to various carcinomas including PCa. Detection of these variants may improve clinical treatment as well as an understanding of the pathobiology underlying this complex disease.  Methods:   To this end, we undertook a pilot genome-wide CNV analysis approach in 36 subjects (18 patients with high-grade PCa and 18 controls that were matched by age and ethnicity) in search of more accurate biomarkers that could potentially explain susceptibility toward high-grade PCa. We conducted this study using the array comparative genomic hybridization technique. Array results were validated in 92 independent samples (46 high-grade PCa, 23 benign prostatic hyperplasia, and 23 healthy controls) using polymerase chain reaction-based copy number counting method.  Results:   A total of 314 CNV regions were found to be unique to PCa subjects in this cohort (P<0.05). A log2 ratio-based copy number analysis revealed 5 putative rare or novel CNV loci or both associated with susceptibility to PCa. The CNV gain regions were 1q21.3, 15q15, 7p12.1, and a novel CNV in PCa 12q23.1, harboring ARNT, THBS1, SLC5A8, and DDC genes that are crucial in the p53 and cancer pathways. A CNV loss and deletion event was observed at 8p11.21, which contains the SFRP1 gene from the Wnt signaling pathway. Cross-comparison analysis with genes associated to PCa revealed significant CNVs involved in biological processes that elicit cancer pathogenesis via cytokine production and endothelial cell proliferation.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, we postulated that the CNVs identified in this study could provide an insight into the development of advanced PCa.""","""['Prevathe Poniah', 'Shamsul Mohd Zain', 'Azad Hassan Abdul Razack', 'Shanggar Kuppusamy', 'Shankar Karuppayah', 'Hooi Sian Eng', 'Zahurin Mohamed']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['A genome-wide association study of copy-number variation identifies putative loci associated with osteoarthritis in Koreans.', 'Copy number variation of urine exfoliated cells by low-coverage whole genome sequencing for diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma: a prospective cohort study.', 'The role of copy number variation in susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: genome-wide association study and comparison with published loci.', 'Genomic copy number variations: A breakthrough in our knowledge on schizophrenia etiology?', 'Clinical significance of germline copy number variation in susceptibility of human diseases.', 'Copy number loss in granzyme genes confers resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Copy number variant analysis and expression profiling of the olfactory receptor-rich 11q11 region in obesity predisposition.', 'Critical evaluation of copy number variant calling methods using DNA methylation.', 'Exposure to an Environmentally Relevant Phthalate Mixture During Prostate Development Induces MicroRNA Upregulation and Transcriptome Modulation in Rats.', 'Overexpression of PARPBP Correlates with Tumor Progression and Poor Prognosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

MWCNTs are very promising as transporters of bioactive molecules because of their π electrons and large surface area, which can be easily modified, mostly by the application of inorganic acids for the introduction of carboxylic moieties on the surface. In the present study, we designed an oxidised MWCNTs (oMWCNTs) transporter for the targeted delivery of doxorubicin (Dox). The modification of oMWCNTs with prostate-homing peptide (SMSIARL) promotes increased cytotoxicity for prostate cancer cells. Using advanced analytical techniques, we studied the loading efficiency, stability, and release kinetics of Dox from a oMWCNTs-Dox-Pep nanoconstruct. We show that pH strictly drives Dox release, and imitating the pH of intracellular acidic compartments, 60% of Dox is released from oMWCNTs-Dox-Pep, while in plasma conditions, only a 14% release of Dox was found during 24h. The nanoconstruct displayed no cytotoxicity in non-malignant prostate cells (PNT1A), while in metastatic prostate cancer cells (LNCaP), the cytotoxic effects were close to the cytotoxicity of free Dox. This indicates that peptide modification promotes interactions with malignant cells, resulting in efficient internalisation into the intracellular region. Overall, we show that oMWCNTs are exceptional platforms for simple and stable non-covalent modification with bioactive molecules.""","""['Vedran Milosavljevic', 'Ludmila Krejcova', 'Roman Guran', 'Hana Buchtelova', 'Dorota Wawrzak', 'Lukas Richtera', 'Zbynek Heger', 'Pavel Kopel', 'Vojtech Adam']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces""","""['Lysinated Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes with Carbohydrate Ligands as an Effective Nanocarrier for Targeted Doxorubicin Delivery to Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Targeted and pH-responsive delivery of doxorubicin to cancer cells using multifunctional dendrimer-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes.', 'The cancer targeting potential of D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate tethered multi walled carbon nanotubes.', 'PEGylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes as versatile vector for tumor-specific intracellular triggered release with enhanced anti-cancer efficiency: Optimization of length and PEGylation degree.', 'Carbon nanotubes as an emerging nanocarrier for the delivery of doxorubicin for improved chemotherapy.', 'Microwave-Assisted Functionalization of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Biosensor and Drug Delivery Applications.', 'Carbon Graphitization: Towards Greener Alternatives to Develop Nanomaterials for Targeted Drug Delivery.', 'Incorporation of functionalized carbon nanotubes into hydrophobic drug crystals for enhancing aqueous dissolution.']"""

This is a cross-sectional UK postal questionnaire study. Three RA patient groups-disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) only, first anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) and failed anti-TNF-were sent postal questionnaires. Data on patient history/demographics, drug counselling experience, knowledge of drug side effects, attitudes to vaccinations, cancer screening and blood borne virus testing was collected; 264/679 (39%) patients responded (median age 65 years, 66% female, median disease duration 15 years). Drug information from rheumatology nurses, rheumatology doctors and information leaflets was most useful. Thirty-eight percent of respondents felt reassured by information received, but 37% felt more worried. Forty percent of participants were aware of important drug side effects. Although 42-65% of patients understood they should temporarily halt anti-TNF therapy with concurrent infection, 75% of patients recalled continuing therapy despite infection. Thirteen percent believed that all vaccinations (including travel vaccinations) were safe while taking anti-TNF. Uptake of UK cancer screening programmes was between 87 and 94%, except prostate screening (47%). Most participants were not aware that they may need to discontinue their anti-TNF if they developed cancer. The majority of participants felt neutral/reassured by the prospect of viral hepatitis (95%) and HIV (91%) testing. Although drug counselling is a well-established part of clinical care, there is potential for further improvement to ensure that patients' knowledge empowers them to act safely.

Most studies have focused on evaluating mural PNI (mPNI); however, extramural PNI (ePNI) may influence the prognosis after rectal cancer resection. We evaluated the prognostic value of ePNI compared with mPNI and with non-PNI, in rectal resections after preoperative chemoradiotherapy in 148 patients with pT3 and pT4 rectal carcinomas. PNI was identified in 35 patients (23.6%), 60% of which were in the mPNI group. Factors associated with PNI were tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, and venous invasion; patients with PNI were more likely to have positive resection margins (65.7% versus 11.6%). ePNI, compared with mPNI, was associated with female sex (64.3% versus 28.6%), positive surgical margins (42.8% versus 28.6%), recurrence (50% versus 28.6%), and death (92.9% versus 28.6%). The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 78.1% for patients without PNI, compared with 63.7% for the mPNI group and 26.4% for the ePNI group (P<.001). On multivariate analysis, the independent adverse prognostic factors were ePNI (odds ratio [OR], 22.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 17.03-24.58; P<.001), overall recurrence (OR, 9.19; CI, 6.11-10.63; P=.002), clinical stage IV (OR, 8.56; CI, 6.34-9.47; P=.003), and positive surgical margin (OR, 3.95; CI, 2.00-4.28; P=.047).

We present findings from CanCHEC (Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort), the largest national population-based cohort of agricultural workers.  Methods:   Statistics Canada created the cohort using deterministic and probabilistic linkage of the 1991 Canadian Long Form Census to National Cancer Registry records for 1992-2010. Self-reported occupations were coded using the Standard Occupational Classification (1991) system. Analyses were restricted to employed persons aged 25-74 years at baseline (N = 2,051,315), with follow-up until December 31, 2010. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were modeled using Cox proportional hazards for all workers in agricultural occupations (n = 70,570; 70.8% male), stratified by sex, and adjusted for age at cohort entry, province of residence, and highest level of education.  Results:   A total of 9515 incident cancer cases (7295 in males) occurred in agricultural workers. Among men, increased risks were observed for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.00-1.21), prostate (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06-1.16), melanoma (HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02-1.31), and lip cancer (HR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.70-2.70). Decreased risks in males were observed for lung, larynx, and liver cancers. Among female agricultural workers there was an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.07-1.72). Increased risks of melanoma (HR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.17-2.73), leukemia (HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.24-3.25) and multiple myeloma (HR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.16-4.37) were observed in a subset of female crop farmers.  Conclusions:   Exposure to pesticides may have contributed to increased risks of hematopoietic cancers, while increased risks of lip cancer and melanoma may be attributed to sun exposure.

Methods:   Twenty PC patients who had undergone RP and had BCR were recruited in this study. All the patients underwent whole-body FCH PET/CT and DCE-MRI of the pelvis. An overall pattern of recurrent disease was analyzed, and diagnostic accuracy for the detection of pelvic disease recurrence by the 2 modalities was evaluated by taking histopathologic analysis as the criterion standard. The whole-body FCH PET/CT images were also analyzed separately for the presence of any extra lesion(s).  Results:   The initial mean Gleason score was 6.3 ± 1.53 (range, 4-9). The mean prostate-specific antigen levels at the time of relapse were 1.9 ± 2.87 ng/mL (range, 0.24-13.2 ng/mL). MRI findings were positive for primary tumor recurrence in the prostate bed in 6 patients (6/20 [30.0%]), pelvic lymph node metastases in 4 patients (4/20 [20.0%]), and for pelvic skeletal metastases in 2 patients (2/20 [10.0%]), respectively. On the other hand, FCH PET/CT results were positive in the corresponding sites in 7 (7/20 [35.0%]), 9 (9/20 [45.0%]), and 2 patients (2/20 [10.0%]), respectively. F-fluorocholine PET/CT and MRI showed comparable results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for PC characterization. The whole-body FCH PET/CT was found to be useful in identifying unknown distant metastases in a significant proportion of patients.

The mechanism underlying tumorigenesis and development of PCa is largely unknown. Here, we identified Kinesin family member 14 (KIF14) as a novel candidate oncogene in PCa. We found that KIF14 was overexpressed in multiple PCa cell lines and primary PCa tissues. Knockdown of KIF14 in DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells suppressed cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Transcriptome analysis by RNA-sequencing demonstrated that KIF4 suppression led to transcriptional changes of genes involved in p53 and TGF-beta signaling pathway. In addition, upregulated expression of GADD45A, GADD45B, p21, PIDD and Shisa5, which contribute to growth arrest and apoptosis induction, and downregulated CCNB1 that promotes cell cycle progression were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR after KIF4 knockdown. We further found that KIF14 protein level was positively correlated with T stage and Gleason Score. Patients with higher KIF14 expression had shorter overall survival time than those with lower KIF14 expression.

Inhibition of autophagy may be an effective strategy to improve the treatment of chemo-resistant cancer by consistent exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs. However, no reports have clearly elucidated the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, in this study, we assessed whether salinomycin, a promising anticancer drug, induces apoptosis and elucidated potential antitumor mechanisms in chemo-resistant prostate cancer cells. Cell viability assay, Western blot, annexin V/propidium iodide assay, acridine orange (AO) staining, caspase-3 activity assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial membrane potential were assayed. Our data showed that salinomycin alters the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to autophagy. Pretreatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, enhanced the salinomycin-induced apoptosis. Notably, salinomycin decreased phosphorylated of AKT and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in prostate cancer cells. Pretreatment with LY294002, an autophagy and PI3K inhibitor, enhanced the salinomycin-induced apoptosis by decreasing the AKT and mTOR activities and suppressing autophagy. However, pretreatment with PD98059 and SB203580, an extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and p38 inhibitors, suppressed the salinomycin-induced autophagy by reversing the upregulation of ERK and p38. In addition, pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, inhibited salinomycin-induced autophagy by suppressing ROS production. Our results suggested that salinomycin induces apoptosis, which was related to ROS-mediated autophagy through regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK/p38 MAPK signaling pathways.""","""['Kwang-Youn Kim', 'Kwang-Il Park', 'Sang-Hun Kim', 'Sun-Nyoung Yu', 'Sul-Gi Park', 'Young Woo Kim', 'Young-Kyo Seo', 'Jin-Yeul Ma', 'Soon-Cheol Ahn']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Plumbagin induces G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy via p38 MAPK- and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-mediated pathways in human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'Pro-apoptotic and pro-autophagic effects of the Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib (MLN8237) on human osteosarcoma U-2 OS and MG-63 cells through the activation of mitochondria-mediated pathway and inhibition of p38 MAPK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'The investigational Aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib (MLN8237) induces cell cycle G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy via p38 MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in human breast cancer cells.', 'Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR inhibitors: rationale and importance to inhibiting these pathways in human health.', 'Promising Anticancer Activities of Alismatis rhizome and Its Triterpenes via p38 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR Signaling Pathways.', 'Extracellular Vesicles Released from Macrophages Infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae Stimulate Proinflammatory Response via the TLR2-NF-κB/JNK Signaling Pathway.', 'Synthesis, characterization, anticancer efficacy evaluation of ruthenium(II) and iridium(III) polypyridyl complexes toward A549 cells.', 'Arctiin-encapsulated DSPE-PEG bubble-like nanoparticles inhibit alveolar epithelial type 2 cell senescence to alleviate pulmonary fibrosis via the p38/p53/p21 pathway.', 'NCF1-dependent production of ROS protects against lupus by regulating plasmacytoid dendritic cell development and functions.', 'Licochalcone A Suppresses Renal Cancer Cell Proliferation and Metastasis by Engagement of Sp1-Mediated LC3 Expression.']"""

Methods:   We evaluated high-risk PCa patients (PSA >20 ng/ml, ≥cT3a, or Gleason score 8-10) who underwent RP between 2007 and 2013 at our institute. We classified patients into three groups according to their pathologic outcomes: favorable (pT2, Gleason score ≤7, and node negative), intermediate (specimen-confined disease (pT2-3a, node negative PCa with negative surgical margins) but not in the favorable group), and unfavorable (the remaining patients). We developed a risk stratification scoring system to predict prognostic outcomes after RP and validated our scoring system to estimate its predictive accuracy.  Results:   Among a total of 356 patients, 95 (26.7%), 115 (32.3%), and 146 (41%) were in the favorable, intermediate, and unfavorable prognostic groups, respectively. The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates of the patients in each group were 87.8, 64.6, and 41.4%, respectively. We developed a scoring system based on preoperative PSA, clinical stage, percentage of tumor positive core, and percentage of cores with a Gleason score 8-10. This demonstrated internally and externally validated concordance indices of 0.733 and 0.772, respectively.

Mean ADC of peripheral (PZ) and transition (TZ) zones, and MR-suspicious lesions were compared between groups over 6 months. Conspicuity was defined as the PZ divided by tumour ADC, and its change over 6 months was assessed.  Results:   A decrease in mean conspicuity in the dutasteride group (but not the controls) was seen over 6 months (1.54 vs 1.38; p = 0.025).

Therefore, we evaluated whether prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand PET/CT may be applied to provide PSMA-derived volumetric parameters for quantification of whole-body tumor burden. Methods: One hundred one patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT because of increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after radical prostatectomy were included in this retrospective analysis. Tracer uptake was quantified using SUVs. Volumetric parameters, that is, PSMA-derived tumor volume (PSMA-TV) and total lesion PSMA (TL-PSMA), were calculated for each patient using a 3-dimensional segmentation and computerized volumetry technique and compared with serum PSA levels. In a group of 10 patients, volumetric parameters were applied for treatment monitoring. Results: Volumetric parameters, that is, whole-body PSMA-TV and whole-body TL-PSMA, demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with PSA levels (P < 0.0001) as a surrogate marker of tumor burden, whereas SUVmax (P = 0.22) or SUVmean (P = 0.45) did not. Treatment response and treatment failure were paralleled by concordant changes in both whole-body PSMA-TV and whole-body TL-PSMA (P = 0.02), whereas neither the change in SUVmax (P = 1.0) nor the change in SUVmean (P = 1.0) concordantly paralleled changes in PSA levels. Conclusion: PSMA-derived volumetric parameters provide a quantitative imaging biomarker for whole-body tumor burden, capable of standardizing quantitative changes in PET imaging of patients with metastatic prostate cancer and of facilitating therapy monitoring.""","""['Sebastian Schmuck', 'Christoph A von Klot', 'Christoph Henkenberens', 'Jan M Sohns', 'Hans Christiansen', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Tobias L Ross', 'Frank M Bengel', 'Thorsten Derlin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-derived metabolic parameters for determination of whole-body tumor burden and treatment response in prostate cancer.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT derived quantitative volumetric tumor parameters for classification and evaluation of therapeutic response of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in prostate cancer.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Early biochemical and radiographic response after one cycle of 177LuLu-PSMA I&T radioligand therapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Role of volumetric parameters obtained from 68\xa0Ga-PSMA PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in predicting overall survival in patients with mCRPC receiving taxane therapy.', 'SUVmean on baseline 18FPSMA-1007 PET and clinical parameters are associated with survival in prostate cancer patients scheduled for 177LuLu-PSMA I&T.', 'A prospective head-to-head comparison of 68GaGa-P16-093 and 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in patients with primary prostate cancer.', 'Histology and PSMA Expression on Immunohistochemistry in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: Comparison with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Features in Primary Staging.']"""

Materials and methods:   Using a monocentric prospectively maintained database, we included 3062 patients who underwent minimally invasive RP between 2006 and 2013. We explored clinicopathologic features and outcomes associated with a GG upgrade from biopsy to RP. Multivariate logistic regression was used to develop and validate a nomogram to predict upgrading for GG1.  Results:   Biopsy GG was upgraded after RP in 51.5% of cases. Patients upgraded from GG1 to GG2 or GG3 after RP had a longer time to biochemical recurrence than those with GG2 or GG3 respectively, on both biopsy and RP, but a shorter time to biochemical recurrence than those who remained GG1 after RP (P < .0001). In multivariate analyses, variables predicting upgrading for GG1 PCa were age (P = .0014), abnormal digital rectal examination (P < .0001), prostate-specific antigen density (P < .0001), percentage of positive cores (P < .0001), and body mass index (P = .037). A nomogram was generated and validated internally.  Conclusions:   Biopsy grading system is misleading in approximately 50% of cases.

However, the transformative targeting potential of magnetic nanoparticles has been stymied by a key obstacle-safe delivery to specified target cells in vivo. As cancer cells grow under nutrient deprivation and hypoxic conditions and decorate cell surface with excessive sialoglycans, sialic acid binding lectins might be suitable for targeting cancer cells in vivo. Here we explore the potential of magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with wheat germ lectin (WGA) conjugate, so-called nanomagnetolectin, as apoptotic targetable agents for prostate cancer. In the presence of magnetic field (magnetofection) for 15min, 2.46nM nanomagnetolectin significantly promoted apoptosis (∼12-fold, p value <0.01) of prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, PC-3, DU-145) compared to normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC, PNT2, PZ-HPV-7), when supplemented with 10mM sialic acid under nutrient deprived condition. Nanomagnetolectin targets cell-surface glycosylation, particularly sialic acid as nanomagnetolectin induced apoptosis of cancer cells largely diminished (only 2 to 2.5-fold) compared to normal cells. The efficacy of magnetofected nanomagnetolectin was demonstrated in orthotopically xenografted (DU-145) mice, where tumor was not only completely arrested, but also reduced significantly (p value <0.001). This was further corroborated in subcutaneous xenograft model, where nanomagnetolectin in the presence of magnetic field and photothermal heating at ∼42°C induced apoptosis of tumor by ∼4-fold compared to tumor section heated at ∼42°C, but without magnetic field.

Accumulation of misfolded proteins has been implicated in cancer. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the role of ERp46 in prostate cancer, its expression and its effects on prostate cancer growth. A tissue microarray with human prostate cancer and normal prostate tissue samples was stained for ERp46 followed by image analysis. Human prostate adenocarcinoma 22Rv1 cells were stably transfected with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specific for ERp46, a non-effective scrambled control or a plasmid containing full-length human ERp46 cDNA, and cell growth was determined. Subcloned cells were treated with thapsigargin or tunicamycin to induce ER stress and lysates were subjected to western blot analysis for ER stress proteins. Subcutaneous xenografts of parental 22Rv1, ERp46-overexpressing (ERp46+), shERp46 or scrambled control cells were established in male inbred BALB/c nude mice (n=10/group). Tumor growth curves of the xenografts were constructed over a period of 30 days and subsequently the mice were sacrificed and the amount of serum prostate-specific antigen was determined. The results demonstrated increased ERp46 expression levels in prostate cancer tissue samples of Gleason ≥7 compared with normal prostate tissue samples. When ERp46 was stably knocked down using shRNA or overexpressed in prostate carcinoma 22Rv1 cells, tumor growth in vitro and in BALB/c nude mice was inhibited and accelerated, respectively. ERp46 overexpression led to reduced sensitivity to ER stress as indicated by higher half maximal inhibitory concentrations for tunicamycin and thapsigargin in ERp46+ cells. The shERp46 cells lost the ability to upregulate protein disulfide isomerase following tunicamycin-induced ER stress. The present study suggests a role for ERp46 as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer, given its expression profile in human prostate cancer, and its effect on prostate cancer cell growth.""","""['Wilhelmina C M Duivenvoorden', 'Sarah N Hopmans', 'Richard C Austin', 'Jehonathan H Pinthus']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Endoplasmic reticulum protein ERp46 in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Role of ERp46 in β-cell lipoapoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway as well as the protective effect of exendin-4.', 'ERp46 is reduced by high glucose and regulates insulin content in pancreatic beta-cells.', 'Reduced expression of ERp46 under diabetic conditions in β-cells and the effect of liraglutide.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein Sec62 as potential therapeutic target in SEC62 overexpressing tumors.', 'Pro-Survival Factor EDEM3 Confers Therapy Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Thioredoxin Domain Containing 5 Suppression Elicits Serum Amyloid A-Containing High-Density Lipoproteins.', 'A novel role for endoplasmic reticulum protein 46 (ERp46) in platelet function and arterial thrombosis in mice.', 'Role of the ERO1-PDI interaction in oxidative protein folding and disease.', 'Targeting the functional interplay between endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin-1α and protein disulfide isomerase suppresses the progression of cervical cancer.']"""

LRPs were performed by two ro-botic fellowship trained surgeons with daily practice in RALP.  Patients and methods:   110 LRP were performed to treat aleatory selected patients. The patients were divided into 4 groups for prospective analyses. A transperitoneal approach that simulates the RALP technique was used.  Results:   The median operative time was 163 minutes (110-240), and this time significantly decreased through case 40, when the time plateaued (p=0.0007). The median blood loss was 250mL. No patients required blood transfusion. There were no life-threatening complications or deaths. Minor complications were uniformly distributed along the series (P=0.6401). The overall positive surgical margins (PSM) rate was 28.2% (20% in pT2 and 43.6% in pT3). PSM was in the prostate apex in 61.3% of cases. At the 12-month follow-up, 88% of men were continent (0-1 pad).  Conclusions:   The present study shows that there are multiple learning curves for LRP. The shallowest learning curve was seen for the operative time. Surgeons transitioning between the RALP and LRP techniques were considered competent based on the low perioperative complication rate, absence of major complications, and lack of blood transfusions. This study shows that a learning curve still exists and that there are factors that must be considered by surgeons transitioning between the two techniques.""","""['José Anastácio Dias Neto', ""Marcos F Dall'oglio"", 'João Roberto Colombo Jr', 'Rafael F Coelho', 'William Carlos Nahas']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy learning curve for experienced laparoscopic surgeons: does it really exist?', 'Preliminary results of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) after fellowship training and experience in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP).', 'Evaluating the learning curve of experienced laparoscopic surgeons in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of retropubic, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: who is the winner?', 'The learning curve of robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: what is the evidence?', 'The learning curves of major laparoscopic and robotic procedures in urology: a systematic review.', 'Can the prophylactic administration of tranexamic acid reduce the blood loss after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy?

This study examines the effect of statins on prostate specimens following prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Patients that received robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) (n = 2,632) were dichotomized according to preoperative statin use. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between statin use and patient clinical and pathological characteristics.  Results:   Men using statins at the time of prostatectomy were older (61.6 &plusmn; 6.4 versus 58.8 &plusmn; 7.2 years, P &lt; .001), and had poorer health status (P &lt; .001). Biopsy Gleason grade, clinical stage and prostate size were similar among the two groups, although statin users had lower diagnostic PSA levels (5.5 &plusmn; 3.6 versus 6.3 &plusmn; 4.9 ng/mL, P &lt; .001) and PSAD (.12 versus .13, P = .001).  Conclusion:   Men taking statins at the time of prostatectomy had similar histopathologic characteristics to non-users, despite having significantly lower serum PSA, being older and having similar sized prostates. This supports prior studies suggesting a PSA reduction effect of statins may warrant consideration of statin usage in decisionalgorithms for active surveillance.""","""['Kristian Stensland', 'Russell B McBride', 'Michael Leapman', 'Adele Hobbs', 'Seyed Behzad Jazayeri', 'David B Samadi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['Men presenting for radical prostatectomy on preoperative statin therapy have reduced serum prostate specific antigen.', 'Influence of statin use on clinicopathological characteristics of localized prostate cancer and outcomes obtained after radical prostatectomy: a single center study.', 'Population based study of predictors of adverse pathology among candidates for active surveillance with Gleason 6 prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Potential of Statins in Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Statins and prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association of statin use with risk of Gleason score-specific prostate cancer: A hospital-based cohort study.']"""

PET/CT imaging with prostate-specific membrane antigen based tracers (68Ga-PSMA) has shown promising results for BCR patients. However, a standardized image interpretation methodology has yet to be properly agreed. The aim of this study, which was promoted and funded by European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM), is to define standardized image interpretation criteria for 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT to detect recurrent PCa lesions in patients treated with primary curative intent therapy (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy) who presented a biochemical recurrence. In the first phase inter-rater agreement between seven readers from seven international centers was calculated on the reading of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT images of 49 patients with BCR. Each reader evaluated findings in five different sites of recurrence (local, loco-regional lymph nodes, distant lymph nodes, bone, and other). In the second phase the re-analysis was limited to cases with poor, slight, fair, or moderate agreement [Krippendorff's (K) alpha<0.61]. Finally, on the basis of the consensus readings, we sought to define a list of revised consensus criteria for 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT interpretation.  Results:   Between-reader agreement for the presence of anomalous findings in any of the five sites was only moderate (K's alpha: 0.47). The agreement improved and became substantial when readers had to judge whether the anomalous findings were suggestive for a pathologic, uncertain, or non-pathologic image (K's alpha: 0.64). K's alpha calculations for each of the five sites of recurrence were also performed and evaluated. First Delphi round was thus conducted. A more detailed definition of the criteria was proposed by the project coordinator, which was then discussed and finally agreed by the seven readers. After the second Delphi round only four cases of disagreement still remained. These were evaluated for a final round, allowing a final agreement table to be written.  Conclusion:   We hope that by developing these consensus guidelines on the interpretation of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, clinicians reporting these studies will be able to provide more consistent clinical reports and that within clinical trials, abnormality classifications will be harmonized, allowing more robust assessment of its diagnostic performance.""","""['Stefano Fanti', 'Silvia Minozzi', 'Joshua James Morigi', 'Frederik Giesel', 'Francesco Ceci', 'Christian Uprimny', 'Michael S Hofman', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Sarah Schwarzenbock', 'Paolo Castellucci', 'Cristina Bellisario', 'Stéphane Chauvie', 'Fabrizio Bergesio', 'Louise Emmett', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Irene Virgolini', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Rodney J Hicks', 'Bernd J Krause', 'Arturo Chiti']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Mapping of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy in 270 Patients with a PSA Level of Less Than 1.0 ng/mL: Impact on Salvage Radiotherapy Planning.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in the management of recurrent prostate cancer.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Interobserver variability, detection rate, and lesion patterns of 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT in early-stage biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Modified PROMISE criteria for standardized interpretation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-targeted PET.', 'PROMISE V2 - something new, something old and something borrowed.', 'Development and external validation of a multivariable 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET-based prediction model for lymph node involvement in men with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer.', 'A VISION Substudy of Reader Agreement on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Scan Interpretation to Determine Patient Eligibility for 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy.', 'Diagnostic value of two-time point 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in the primary staging of untreated prostate cancer.']"""

This model combines automata approaches with image processing algorithms to simulate the cellular response of tumours exposed to ionizing radiation, modelling the alteration of oxygen permeabilization in blood vessels against repeated doses, and introducing mitotic catastrophe (as opposed to arbitrary delayed cell-death) as a means of modelling radiation-induced cell death. Published data describing cell death in vitro as well as tumour oxygenation in vivo are used to inform parameters. Our model is validated by comparing simulations to in vivo data obtained from the radiation treatment of mice transplanted with human prostate tumours. We then predict the efficacy of untested hypofractionation protocols, hypothesizing that tumour control can be optimized by adjusting daily radiation dosage as a function of the degree of hypoxia in the tumour environment.

The post-transcription data from CSCs that have undergone combinatorial treatment with sFRP4 and chemotherapeutic drugs suggest downregulation of stemness genes and upregulation of pro-apoptotic markers. The post-translational modification of CSCs demonstrated a chemo-sensitization effect of sFRP4 when used in combination with tumor-specific drugs. SFRP4 in combination with doxorubicin/cisplatin reduced the proliferative capacity of the CSC population in vitro.

Pharmaceutical induction of BRCAness could expand the use of PARP inhibitors to other tumor types. For example, BRCA mutations are present in only ~20% of prostate cancer patients. We found that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells showed increased expression of a set of HR-associated genes, including BRCA1, RAD54L, and RMI2 Although androgen-targeted therapy is typically not effective in CRPC patients, the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide suppressed the expression of those HR genes in CRPC cells, thus creating HR deficiency and BRCAness.

Previously, we observed that proteasomal-dependent degradation of AR in response to 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) depends primarily on the E3 ligase C-terminus of HSP70-interacting protein (STUB1/CHIP). Here, 2-ME stimulation activates CHIP by phosphorylation via Aurora kinase A (AURKA). Aurora A kinase inhibitors and RNAi knockdown of Aurora A transcript selectively blocked CHIP phosphorylation and AR degradation. Aurora A kinase is activated by 2-ME in the S-phase as well as during mitosis, and phosphorylates CHIP at S273. Prostate cancer cells expressing an S273A mutant of CHIP have attenuated AR degradation upon 2-ME treatment compared with cells expressing wild-type CHIP, supporting the idea that CHIP phosphorylation by Aurora A activates its E3 ligase activity for the AR. These results reveal a novel 2-ME→Aurora A→CHIP→AR pathway that promotes AR degradation via the proteasome that may offer novel therapeutic opportunities for prostate cancer.

The ASCO Value Framework (AVF) allows users to generate a net health benefit (NHB) score along with drug acquisition costs for oncology regimens that have been compared in a prospective randomized clinical trial. In contrast, the NCCN Evidence Blocks (NEB) derives ratings from an expert panel assessment in the categories of efficacy, safety, quality and consistency of evidence, and affordability.  Objective:   To compare the results of the AVF and NEB by applying each tool to the same clinical scenarios.  Methods:   We evaluated 2 regimens using the AVF and NEB scores: (1) enzalutamide for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and (2) nivolumab versus docetaxel in treatment of advanced squamous and nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Results:   Enzalutamide generated a total NHB score of 44.8 (range 0-180) for use before chemotherapy and 70.8 for use after chemotherapy with a monthly cost of $8,495 in the AVF. The NEB scored enzalutamide 4 (very effective) for efficacy, 4 (occasionally toxic) for safety, and 2 (expensive) for affordability in the no visceral metastases block. It scored 3 (moderately effective) for efficacy, 4 for safety, and 2 for affordability in the visceral metastases block. Nivolumab in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC scored 36.0 and 73.2 in advanced squamous NSCLC, with a monthly cost of $7,010 in the AVF. The NEB gave nivolumab a score of 4 for efficacy and safety and 1 (very expensive) for affordability in the NEB in advanced nonsquamous and advanced squamous NSCLC.  Conclusions:   The AVF and NEB are novel tools that take different approaches in assessing the value of an oncology treatment regimen. From this study, it is clear that the findings generated by these tools are distinct. The AVF provides a summary score for treatments across all clinical benefit and toxicity categories, whereas the NEB provides component scores for treatment efficacy, safety, quality and consistency of evidence, and affordability. Both tools are novel and come with their own challenges.  Disclosures:   No outside funding supported this study. Shah-Manek is also employed by Ipsos Healthcare, a consulting firm.

Despite the advanced surgical resection techniques and anticancer drugs currently available to treat early stage gastric cancer, the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer remains poor. The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important process for the initiation of tumorigenesis. Recent studies suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) can promote cell migration and invasion. Thus, an imbalance of redox homeostasis can result in cancer cells exhibiting EMT properties. PRXs are upregulated in various tumors in the breast, bladder, lung, cervical, ovarian, prostate, esophageal, and hepatocellular. However, PRX expression and its impact on disease prognosis, patient survival rate, and EMT are rarely studied in the context of human gastric cancer. The expression of PRX5 was significantly correlated with tumor size, depth of tumor, lymphatic invasion in patients of gastric cancer. In addition, overexpression of PRX5 enhanced carcinogenicity by increasing the proliferation and invasiveness of gastric cancer cells via upregulation of Snail. Taken together, we suggest that PRX5 may be a potential factor that may contribute to poor prognosis of gastric cancer through enhancing the mesenchymal phenotype. Finally, PRX5 is a putative therapeutic target and clinical strategy for various cancers overexpressing PRX5.""","""['Bokyung Kim', 'Yeon Soo Kim', 'Hye-Mi Ahn', 'Hyo Jin Lee', 'Min Kyu Jung', 'Hyun Yong Jeong', 'Dong Kyu Choi', 'Jun Hyeog Lee', 'Sang-Rae Lee', 'Jin Man Kim', 'Dong-Seok Lee']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Significances of contactin-1 expression in human gastric cancer and knockdown of contactin-1 expression inhibits invasion and metastasis of MKN45 gastric cancer cells.', 'Peroxiredoxin 5 promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colon cancer.', 'The SNAIL/miR-128 axis regulated growth, invasion, metastasis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of gastric cancer.', 'The role of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein in gastric cancer.', 'Gastric cancer: Metabolic and metabolomics perspectives (Review).', 'The Role of Peroxiredoxins in Cancer Development.', 'Effects of Antioxidant Gene Overexpression on Stress Resistance and Malignization In Vitro and In Vivo: A Review.', 'ROS-Influenced Regulatory Cross-Talk With Wnt Signaling Pathway During Perinatal Development.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of the PRDXs Family in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Prognostic Value of Peroxiredoxin-1 Expression in Patients with Solid Tumors: a Meta-Analysis of Cohort Study.']"""

Ectopic expression assays showed that both strands of miRNAs significantly suppressed cancer cell migration and invasion. Our strategies of miRNA target searching demonstrated that SPOCK1 (SPARC/osteonectin, cwcv and kazal like domains proteoglycan 1) was directly regulated by miR‑150‑5p and miR‑150‑3p. Knockdown of SPOCK1 by siRNA inhibited cancer cell aggressiveness. Moreover, overexpression of SPOCK1 was observed in naïve PCa and CRPC tissues.

The well-dispersed Pt nanoclusters-coated copper phosphate ultrathin nanosheets (PtNCs/Cu3(PO4)2NSs) were first successfully synthesized as a photoelectrode material. Because of the ultrathin two-dimensional lamellar structure of Cu3(PO4)2NSs with a 1.3 nm thickness, as well as the homogeneous size and abundant PtNCs loaded on Cu3(PO4)2NSs, the resultant PtNCs/Cu3(PO4)2NSs were employed as a photoelectrode material for the first time and revealed outstanding photocatalytic activity in PEC sensing as a substrate. As a well-designed protocol, we realized accurate miRNA quantification via a novel signal amplification strategy based on G-wire superstructure exponentially ligating a signal probe, which possesses efficient and simple operation compared to the traditional amplification method. Moreover, the electron donor is generated in situ by lactate oxidase (Lox) labels catalyzing lactate for H2O2 production, boosting the efficient separation of electron-hole pairs for further signal amplification. Impressively, this PEC sensing platform is commendably utilized to determine miRNA-141 from prostate carcinoma cell line 22Rv1.

We found that Rhy exhibited substantial cytotoxic effect against human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells when compared with other human carcinoma cell lines including those of lung, pancreas, prostate, head and neck, breast, multiple myeloma, brain and renal cell carcinoma. Rhy induced apoptosis as characterized by accumulation of cells in sub G1 phase; positive Annexin V binding; activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3; and cleavage of PARP (poly-ADP ribose polymerase). This effect of Rhy correlated with the down-regulation of various proteins that mediated cell proliferation, cell survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Moreover, cell proliferation, migration, and constitutive CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4), MMP-9 (Matrix metallopeptidase-9), and MMP-2 expression were inhibited upon Rhy treatment. We further investigated the effect of Rhy on the oncogenic cell signaling cascades through phospho-kinase array profiling assay. Rhy was found to abrogate phospho-p38, ERK, JNK, CREB, c-Jun, Akt, and STAT3 signals, but interestingly enhanced phospho-p53 signal.

The blank and loaded nanoparticles have been fully characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), ζ-potential measurements and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The data are compatible with the distribution of the drug between the nanoparticle core and the shell, where it is probably anchored by inclusion of the DTX aromatic moieties in βCD cavities. Indeed, the release kinetics profiles evidenced an initial fast release of the drug, which likely accounts for the fraction hosted on the surface, followed by a slow and sustained release rate, corresponding to diffusion of DTX in the core, which can be finely tuned by modification of the giant amphiphile chemical structure. The ability of the docetaxel-loaded nanoparticles to induce cellular death in different prostate (human LnCap and PC3) and glioblastoma (human U87 and rat C6) cells was also explored. Giant amphiphile-based DTX formulations surpassing or matching the antitumoral activity of the free DTX formulation were identified in all cases with no need to employ any organic co-solvent, thus overcoming the DTX water solubility problems. Moreover, the presence of the βCD shell at the surface of the assemblies is intended to impart stealth properties against serum proteins while permitting nanoparticle surface decoration by supramolecular approaches, paving the way for a new generation of molecularly well-defined antitumoral drug delivery systems with improved specificity and efficiency.

The aim of this study was to analyze the expression profile of CXC-chemokines and the effects of ESM-1 gene knockdown in proliferation, migration and CXC-chemokine expression in highly metastatic human prostate PC-3 cells. Expression profiles of CXC-chemokines were analyzed in metastatic PC-3 and non-tumorigenic PWR-1E cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of ESM-1 was performed into PC-3 cells, which were subsequently tested for cell migration and proliferation. Effect of siRNA transfection on CXC-chemokine expression was further quantified at the transcript and protein level. RT-qPCR analysis and sandwich ELISA assay revealed higher levels of ESM-1 and several CXC-chemokines in metastatic PC-3 cells compared to non-tumorigenic PWR-1E. Transfection of PC-3 cells with ESM-1-siRNA decreased cell migration with no effect on proliferation, and it was accompanied by decrease in the transcript and protein levels of the angiogenic chemokine CXCL3. We report here for the first time the ESM-1 targeting in PC-3 cells, which resulted in decreased migration, which may be related, at least in part, to decreased expression of the angiogenic CXCL3 chemokine, whose expression was found to be reduced in ESM-1-siRNA transfected cells.

We recently demonstrated that the expression of an innate immune receptor, TLR9, by prostate cancer cells is critical for their tumor-propagating potential. We investigated whether cancer cell-intrinsic TLR9 signaling alters composition of the prostate tumor microenvironment. We generated Ras/Myc (RM9) and Myc-driven (Myc-CaP) prostate cancer cells expressing the tetracycline-inducible gene Tlr9 (Tlr9ON ) or the control LacZ (LacZON ). When engrafted into mice and treated with tetracycline, Tlr9ON , but not LacZON , tumors showed accelerated growth kinetics compared with tumors in PBS-treated mice. Tlr9 upregulation in cancer cells triggered the selective accumulation of CD11b+Ly6GHILy6CLO myeloid cells, phenotypically similar to PMN-MDSCs. The PMN-MDSCs from tetracycline-treated RM9-Tlr9ON tumors increased the immunosuppressive activity of the STAT3 transcription factor, thereby more potently inhibiting T cell proliferation. We identified LIF, an IL-6-type cytokine and STAT3 activator, as a potential mediator of crosstalk between TLR9-expressing prostate cancer cells and PMN-MDSCs. Antibody-mediated LIF neutralization reduced the percentage of tumor-infiltrating PMN-MDSCs and inhibited tumor growth in mice. The clinical relevance of LIF is confirmed by the correlation between TLR9 and LIF expression in prostate cancer specimens. Furthermore, blood samples from patients with prostate cancer showed elevated levels of LIF and high LIFR expression on circulating PMN-MDSCs. Our results suggest that TLR9+ prostate cancers promote immune evasion via LIF-mediated expansion and activation of PMN-MDSCs. Finally, targeting TLR9/LIF/STAT3 signaling using oligonucleotide-based inhibitors, such as CpG-STAT3dODN, can offer new opportunities for prostate cancer immunotherapy.""","""['Haejung Won', 'Dayson Moreira', 'Chan Gao', 'Priyanka Duttagupta', 'Xingli Zhao', 'Edwin Manuel', 'Don Diamond', 'Yate-Ching Yuan', 'Zheng Liu', 'Jeremy Jones', ""Massimo D'Apuzzo"", 'Sumanta Pal', 'Marcin Kortylewski']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Leukoc Biol""","""['TLR9-Targeted STAT3 Silencing Abrogates Immunosuppressive Activity of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells from Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'TLR9 signaling through NF-κB/RELA and STAT3 promotes tumor-propagating potential of prostate cancer cells.', 'Myeloid cells as a target for oligonucleotide therapeutics: turning obstacles into opportunities.', 'ANKRD22 is a potential novel target for reversing the immunosuppressive effects of PMN-MDSCs in ovarian cancer.', 'Immunotherapy Targeting Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) in Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Role and mechanism of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor in cervical cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Leukemia inhibitory factor, a double-edged sword with therapeutic implications in human diseases.', 'Circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells and survival in prostate cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Immunotherapeutic Implications of Toll-like Receptors Activation in Tumor Microenvironment.', 'The Pleiotropic role, functions and targeted therapies of LIF/LIFR axis in cancer: Old spectacles with new insights.']"""

We examined national trends in the use of ADT with SRT.  Materials and methods:   Of the 484,009 patients in the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2012 with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy (RP), 4,200 men received SRT (≥6mo after surgery). We used Pearson's chi-squared test to evaluate changes in ADT use, and multiple logistic regression to examine predictors of ADT use.  Results:   Overall, 32.1% of SRT patients received ADT, which increased after initial results of RTOG 9601 showed an improvement in metastasis-free survival in 2010 (28.5% in 2008/2009 vs. 34.5% in 2011/2012, P = 0.006).

Conclusion:   Although less than one-third of SRT patients from the study era received ADT, there is evidence that physicians and patients have begun slowly adopting this practice with the 2010 reporting of a decrease in the cumulative incidence of metastases with the addition of ADT to SRT.

However, because CT has low soft tissue contrast, it makes manual contouring difficult for major pelvic organs. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides high soft tissue contrast, which makes it ideal for accurate manual contouring. Therefore, the contouring accuracy on CT can be significantly improved if the contours in MRI can be mapped to CT domain by registering MRI with CT of the same subject, which would eventually lead to high treatment efficacy. In this paper, we propose a bi-directional image synthesis based approach for MRI-to-CT pelvic image registration. First, we use patch-wise random forest with auto-context model to learn the appearance mapping from CT to MRI domain, and then vice versa. Consequently, we can synthesize a pseudo-MRI whose anatomical structures are exactly same with CT but with MRI-like appearance, and a pseudo-CT as well. Then, our MRI-to-CT registration can be steered in a dual manner, by simultaneously estimating two deformation pathways: 1) one from the pseudo-CT to the actual CT and 2) another from actual MRI to the pseudo-MRI. Next, a dual-core deformation fusion framework is developed to iteratively and effectively combine these two registration pathways by using complementary information from both modalities. Experiments on a dataset with real pelvic CT and MRI have shown improved registration performance of the proposed method by comparing it to the conventional registration methods, thus indicating its high potential of translation to the routine radiation therapy.""","""['Xiaohuan Cao', 'Jianhua Yang', 'Yaozong Gao', 'Yanrong Guo', 'Guorong Wu', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Learning-Based Multimodal Image Registration for Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Automatic Substitute Computed Tomography Generation and Contouring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Alone External Beam Radiation Therapy From Standard MRI Sequences.', 'An adaptive MR-CT registration method for MRI-guided prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'A review of segmentation and deformable registration methods applied to adaptive cervical cancer radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'Is image-to-image translation the panacea for multimodal image registration?

In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of ENDOD1 in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry were performed in 30 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 50 cases of PCa to identify its association with clinicopathological characteristics. Real-time PCR and western blot were used to detect ENDOD1 mRNA and protein expression in normal prostatic epithelial and PCa cell lines. MTT assays were employed to determine the effect of cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to explore the cell cycle distribution and apoptotic effects. Transwell migration and invasion assays were done to evaluate changes in the ability of cell migration and invasion.  Results:   Immunoreactivity scores of ENDOD1 showed no statistical difference between BPH and low-grade PCa, whereas lower immunostaining scores were observed in high-grade compared with low-grade PCa. Real-time PCR data indicated that ENDOD1 mRNA expression was markedly increased in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells and decreased in PC3 and DU145 cells compared to the normal epithelial cells RWPE1. Western blot showed that androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells had the highest protein expression level of ENDOD1, whereas castration-resistant PCa cell lines PC3 and DU145 had significantly lower protein levels. Meanwhile, overexpression of ENDOD1 suppressed cell proliferation, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibited cell migration and invasion. Conversely, siRNA-mediated silencing of ENDOD1 promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion. No apoptotic effects occurred upon manipulation of ENDOD1 expression.

Methods:   In this retrospective study, 15 oligometastasized PC patients with a total of 20 bone metastases were evaluated regarding biochemical progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), time to initiation of ADT, and local control rate (LCR). Three patients received concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Results:   The median follow-up after RT was 22.5 months (range 7.0-53.7 months). The median PSA-PFS was 6.9 months (range 1.1-28.4 months). All patients showing a decrease of PSA level after RT of at least factor 10 reveal a PSA-PFS of >12 months. Median PSA-PFS of this sub-group was 23.1 months (range 12.1-28.4 months). Local PFS (LPFS) after 2 years was 100%. One patient developed a local failure after 28.4 months. Median distant PFS (DPFS) was 7.36 months (range 1.74-54.34 months). The time to initiation of ADT in patients treated without ADT was 9.3 months (range 2.6-36.1 months). In all patients, the time to intensification of systemic therapy or the time to initiation of ADT increased from 9.3 to 12.3 months (range 2.6-36.1 months). Gleason-Score, ADT or the localization of metastasis had no impact on PFS or time to intensification of systemic therapy. No SBRT related acute or late toxicities were observed.  Conclusion:   Our study shows that SBRT of bone metastases is a highly effective therapy with an excellent risk-benefit profile. However, PFS was limited due to a high distant failure rate implying the difficulty for patient selection for this oligometastatic concept.

Results:   IPSS score of incomplete urination (42.3 ± 2.04%), frequency of urination (20.08 ± 1.02%), intermittency (40.78 ± 2.16%), urgency (60.91 ± 3.14%), weak stream (50.58 ± 2.14%), straining (55.67 ± 2.53%) and nocturia (40.14 ± 1.89%) in treatment group were significantly decreased after treatment compare to placebo receiving group. Furthermore, the prostate volume (16.92 ± 0.89%) and extant urine volume (28.12 ± 1.36%) also significantly decreased in treatment group compared to control group. No significant side effects or abnormalities in biochemical tests and urinalysis were observed throughout the study.

Materials and methods:   Six hundred and twenty five patients undergoing multiparametric MRI were investigated. MRI findings were classified using PI-RADS v1 or v2. All patients underwent fusPbx combined with sysPbx (comPbx). The lesion with the highest PI-RADS was defined as maximum PI-RADS (maxPI-RADS). Gleason Score ≥7 (3 + 4) was defined as significant PCa.  Results:   The overall PCa detection rate was 51% (n = 321; 39% significant PCa). The detection rate was 43% in fusPbx (n = 267; 34% significant PCa) and 36% in sysPbx (n = 223; 27% significant PCa). Nine percentage of significant PCa were detected by sysPbx alone. A total of 1,162 lesions were investigated. The detection rate of significant PCa in lesions with PI-RADS 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 9% (18/206), 12% (56/450), 27% (98/358), and 61% (90/148) respectively. maxPI-RADS ≥4 was the strongest predictor for the detection of significant PCa in comPbx (OR 2.77; 95% CI 1.81-4.24; p < 0.005).

The RapidPlan (RP) knowledge-based engine was tested for the planning of Volumetric modulated arc therapy with RapidArc on prostate cancer patients. The study was conducted in the frame of the German RapidPlan Consortium (GRC).  Methods and materials:   43 patients from one institute of the GRC were used to build and train a RP model. This was further shared with all members of the GRC plus an external site from a different country to increase the heterogeneity of the patient's sampling. An in silico multicentric validation of the model was performed at planning level by comparing RP against reference plans optimized according to institutional procedures. A total of 60 patients from 7 institutes were used.  Results:   On average, the automated RP based plans resulted fully consistent with the manually optimised set with a modest tendency to improvement in the medium-to-high dose region. A per-site stratification allowed to identify different patterns of performance of the model with some organs at risk resulting better spared with the manual or with the automated approach but in all cases the RP data fulfilled the clinical acceptability requirements. Discrepancies in the performance were due to different contouring protocols or to different emphasis put in the optimization of the manual cases.  Conclusions:   The multicentric validation demonstrated that it was possible to satisfactorily optimize with the knowledge based model patients from all participating centres. In the presence of possibly significant differences in the contouring protocols, the automated plans, though acceptable and fulfilling the benchmark goals, might benefit from further fine tuning of the constraints. The study demonstrates that, at least for the case of prostate cancer patients, it is possibile to share models among different clinical institutes in a cooperative framework.""","""['Carolin Schubert', 'Oliver Waletzko', 'Christian Weiss', 'Dirk Voelzke', 'Sevda Toperim', 'Arnd Roeser', 'Silvia Puccini', 'Marc Piroth', 'Christian Mehrens', 'Jan-Dirk Kueter', 'Kirsten Hierholz', 'Karsten Gerull', 'Antonella Fogliata', 'Andreas Block', 'Luca Cozzi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Dosimetric comparison of RapidPlan and manually optimized plans in volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'On the pre-clinical validation of a commercial model-based optimisation engine: application to volumetric modulated arc therapy for patients with lung or prostate cancer.', 'The role of a\xa0knowledge based dose-volume histogram predictive model in the optimisation of intensity-modulated proton plans for hepatocellular carcinoma patients : Training and validation of a\xa0novel commercial system.', ""Evaluation of multiple institutions' models for knowledge-based planning of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for prostate cancer."", 'A broad scope knowledge based model for optimization of VMAT in esophageal cancer: validation and assessment of plan quality among different treatment centers.', 'Evaluating machine learning enhanced intelligent-optimization-engine (IOE) performance for ethos head-and-neck (HN) plan generation.', 'The effect of integrating knowledge-based planning with multicriteria optimization in treatment planning for prostate SBRT.', 'Validation of RapidPlan Knowledge-Based Model for Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Dosimetric potential of knowledge-based planning model trained with HyperArc plans for brain metastases.', 'A comparison of in-house and shared RapidPlan models for prostate radiation therapy planning.']"""

The objective of this study was to investigate the relation of Gleason grade 4 tumor percentage (%GG4) and invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma in GS 3+4=7 prostate cancer biopsies. We reviewed 1031 prostate cancer biopsies from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. In total 370 men had G3+4=7. The relation of invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma and %GG4 with biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) after radical prostatectomy (n=146) and radiation therapy (n=195) was analyzed using Cox regression. Invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma occurred in 7/121 (6%) patients with 1-10% GG4, 29/131 (22%) with 10-25%, and 52/118 (44%) with 25-50% GG4 (P<0.001). In crude analysis, both invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma (HR 2.72; 95% CI: 1.33-5.95; P=0.006) and 10-50% GG4 (HR 2.43; 95% CI: 1.10-5.37; P=0.03) were associated with BCRFS after prostatectomy. In adjusted analysis, invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma was an independent predictor for BCRFS (HR 2.40; 95% CI: 1.03-5.60; P=0.04) after prostatectomy, whereas percentage %GG4 (HR 1.00; 95% CI: 0.97-1.03; P=0.80) was not. While invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma (HR 2.58; 95% CI: 1.59-4.21; P<0.001) performed better than 10-50% GG4 (HR 1.24; 95% CI: 0.67-2.29; P=0.49) for prediction of BCRFS after radiation therapy, both parameters were insignificant in analysis adjusted for prostate-specific antigen (P=0.001), positive biopsies (P<0.001) and tumor volume (P=0.05). In conclusion, increased %GG4 is associated with invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma in GS 3+4=7 prostate cancer biopsies. Invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma is an independent parameter for BCR after prostatectomy, whereas %GG4 is not.

Accurate imaging of PCa recurrent lymph node metastases (LNM) is crucial for metastases directed therapies such as salvage-lymph node dissection (salvage-LND). Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PSMA-PET/CT for detection of affected lymph-node regions at salvage-LND for nodal recurrence of PCa. Design, setting and participants: 30 patients with the suspicion of exclusively nodal PCa-relapse after primary therapy underwent a template pelvic and/or retroperitoneal salvage-LND after whole body 68-Ga-PSMA-PET/CT. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT was evaluated in comparison to the histopathology of 965 resected lymph nodes (LN) dissected from 68 main regions (pelvic left/right, retroperitoneal) and 289 subregions (common iliac, external iliac, obturator, internal iliac, presacral, aortic-bifurcation, aortal, caval). LNM and tumor deposits in LNM were measured bidimensionally in the histopathology. PSMA-expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in LNM. Results: LNM were present in 11.4% of the resected LN (110/965) resulting in 45 positive main regions and 85 positive subregions. PET/CT was true positive in 41 main regions and 69 subregions. Three PET-negative main regions and 16 PET-negative subregions finally contained LNM, the majority of these false negative subregions (13/16) were in neighboring regions of true-positive subregions. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were: main region-based 93.2%, 100%, 100%, 88.9% and 95.6%, subregion-based 81.2%, 99.5%, 98.6%, 92.7 and 94.1%. Median short diameters of tumor deposits in LNM resected from false-negative subregions (1.3 mm) were significantly smaller than in LNM removed from true-positive subregions (5.5 mm, p<0.0001). Based on anatomical subregions containing just one LNM, the necessary short diameter of tumor deposits in LNM required to reach a detection rate of 50% and 90% was estimated to be ≥ 2.3 mm and ≥ 4.5 mm, respectively. Conclusion: In men with biochemical PCa-relapse and positive PSMA-PET/CT, PET/CT detects metastatic affected anatomical regions with high accuracy at a main region and at a subregion-level. If the decision for salvage-LND is prompted by a positive PSMA-PET/CT, the size of metastases is crucial for accurate detection of affected regions. All LNM showed a clear PSMA-expression in the immunohistochemistry. Further studies need to investigate how to translate the high anatomical correlation observed between PET/CT and surgical findings into optimal approaches for target salvage-LND.""","""['Cordula A Jilg', 'Vanessa Drendel', 'H Christian Rischke', 'Teresa Beck', 'Werner Vach', 'Kathrin Schaal', 'Ulrich Wetterauer', 'Wolfgang Schultze-Seemann', 'Philipp T Meyer']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Re: Diagnostic Accuracy of Ga-68-HBED-CC-PSMA-ligand-PET/CT Before Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA-PET for Lymph Node Detection in Recurrent Prostate Cancer: How do we use the Magic Bullet?', 'Value of 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET for the Assessment of Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence: Comparison with Histopathology After Salvage Lymphadenectomy.', 'Detection Rate of 18F-Choline PET/CT and 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT for Prostate Cancer Lymph Node Metastases with Direct Link from PET to Histopathology: Dependence on the Size of Tumor Deposits in Lymph Nodes.', '68Ga-PSMA Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Provides Accurate Staging of Lymph Node Regions Prior to Lymph Node Dissection in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-guided salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer: a novel technology to detect lymph node metastases.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Diagnostic Impact of Dual-Time PET/CT with 68Gallium-PSMA in Prostate Cancer and 68Gallium-DOTATOC in Neuroendocrine Tumors.', 'Standardized classification schemes in reporting oncologic PET/CT.', 'Necessity of Pelvic Lymph Node Irradiation in Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy in the PSMA PET/CT Era: A Narrative Review.', 'Combining PSA and PET features to select candidates for salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer.', '99mTc-PSMA targeted robot-assisted radioguided surgery during radical prostatectomy and extended lymph node dissection of prostate cancer patients.']"""

Here aiming at the receptor for hyaluronic acid mediated motility (RHAMM or CD168), a specific receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA), the bioreductive responsive HA nanogels loaded doxorubicin were prepared. The targeting effects of HA nanogels in high RHAMM-expressed cancer cells, primary and metastatic tumors were investigated. It was found that HA nanogels show a strong in vitro and in vivo RHAMM-mediated cellular uptake and drug delivery. The cellular uptake of HA nanogels in high RHAMM-expressed LNCaP and H22 cells was far more than the uptake in low RHAMM-expressed NIH3T3 cells. The IC50 value of drug-loaded HA nanogels against H22 cells was lower than that of free drug. In vivo antitumor activity examinations showed that the HA nanogels not only had significantly superior antitumor efficacy in murine H22 and human LNCaP tumor-bearing mice but also exhibited much deep tumor penetration. The drug delivery of lymph node metastasis by systemically administering HA nanogels demonstrated that the HA nanogels could sufficiently increase drug concentration in metastatic lymph node by RHAMM-HA interaction and inhibit the growth of metastatic lymph node, even completely heal malignant lymph node metastasis. Thus, RHAMM-directed drug delivery is a promising therapy route for treating both primary and metastatic tumors.""","""['Chenchen Yang', 'Cheng Li', 'Peng Zhang', 'Wei Wu', 'Xiqun Jiang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Target-specific intracellular delivery of siRNA using degradable hyaluronic acid nanogels.', 'NIR and UV-responsive degradable hyaluronic acid nanogels for CD44-targeted and remotely triggered intracellular doxorubicin delivery.', 'GE11 peptide modified and reduction-responsive hyaluronic acid-based nanoparticles induced higher efficacy of doxorubicin for breast carcinoma therapy.', 'Hyaluronan/Hyaladherins - a Promising Axis for Targeted Drug Delivery in Cancer.', 'Smart stimuli sensitive nanogels in cancer drug delivery and imaging: a review.', 'Extracellular matrix remodeling in tumor progression and immune escape: from mechanisms to treatments.', 'Increased expression of HMMR in renal cell carcinoma is an independent prognostic factor.', 'Prospective bacterial and fungal sources of hyaluronic acid: A review.', 'Redox-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems: A Chemical Perspective.', 'Recent Progress in Bio-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems for Tumor Therapy.']"""

However, how cancer-derived circulating miRNAs modulate such interaction remains unclear. Here we discovered that circulating miR-410-5p, secreted by prostate cancer cells, entered dendritic cells (DCs), with the aid of argonaute-2 protein. The cancer cell antigens stimulated the DCs to produce miR-410-3p, a highly complementary counterpart of miR-410-5p derived from pre-miR-410.

These antagonists are also known as sartans, and are a group of pharmaceuticals that possess tetrazole or imidazole groups. In the present study, the anticancer and antimetastatic effects of the ARBs fimasartan, losartan, eprosartan and valsartan on the human prostate cancer PC-3, DU-145 and LNCap-LN3 cell lines were investigated in vitro. The proliferation of the prostate cancer cells was inhibited following treatment with 100 µM ARB. In particular, treatment with fimasartan resulted in marked anti-proliferative activity compared with the other ARBs. With respect to the molecular mechanism of the growth inhibition exhibited by the ARBs, 3-methyladenin (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor, was revealed to increase the survival rate of PC-3 cells when cell death inhibitors were pretreated with fimasartan. In addition, the ARBs induced autophagy with increased expression levels of autophagy protein (Atg) 5-12, Atg 16-like-1, beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3). Notably, the enhanced expression of LC3-II (a 6.7-fold increase at 72 h) was observed in PC3 cells treated with fimasartan. This was supported by the observation of the time-dependent accumulation of LC3-positive foci in PC-3. In addition, a migration assay indicated that the ARBs induced anti-metastatic effects in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. The aforementioned results suggest that ARBs may induce autophagy-associated cell death and anti-metastatic activity in prostate cancer cells. Thus, ARBs may be a potential medication for patients with prostate cancer and hypertension.""","""['Yunseo Woo', 'Yu-Jin Jung']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Clinical pharmacokinetics of angiotensin II (AT1) receptor blockers in hypertension.', 'Telmisartan is a potent target for prevention and treatment in human prostate cancer.', 'Incidence and Pattern of Aminotransferase Elevation During Anti-Hypertensive Therapy With Angiotensin-II Receptor Blockers.', 'Telmisartan inhibits human urological cancer cell growth through early apoptosis.', 'Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists.', 'Endothelial Autophagy Dysregulation in Diabetes.', 'Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Associated with a Decreased Risk of Lung Cancer: An Updated Meta-Analysis.', 'Geroscience-guided repurposing of FDA-approved drugs to target aging: A proposed process and prioritization.', 'The Effect of Local Renin Angiotensin System in the Common Types of Cancer.', 'The Use of Antihypertensive Drugs as Coadjuvant Therapy in Cancer.']"""

HER2 positive breast cancer (HER2 BC) patients on trastuzumab therapy are at risk of the development of unpredictable and often fatal central nervous system (CNS) metastases and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients urgently need a marker of disease progression during therapy. Proposed metastatic markers: circulating tumor cells (CTC), serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), 9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were prospectively studied to confirm their utility in these two narrowly defined groups of cancer patients.  Patients and methods:   The groups comprised 44 advanced HER2 BC, 24 CRPC patients and 42 healthy controls. An immunomagnetic separation method followed by PCR and electrophoretic detection (AdnaGen, Germany) were used for CTC determination. Serum marker levels were determined by the ELISAs (R&D System, USA).  Results:   MMP-2 serum level was significantly higher in HER2 BC patients who developed CNS metastases, especially if there were also bone metastases. CTCs were a negative predictive marker for overall survival in HER2 BC patients. MMP-9 serum level was significantly higher in CRPC patients in whom disease progression occurred. CTC vanished from the blood of most of the CRPC patients (from 88% to 37%) during chemotherapy.  Conclusion:   MMP-2 serum level and CTCs show the potential to predict CNS metastases and overall survival in BC patients. CTCs and MMP-9 serum level could be a promising therapy response marker in CRPC patients.""","""['Marketa Skerenova', 'Veronika Mikulova', 'Otakar Capoun', 'Tomas Zima', 'Petra Tesarova']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub""","""['Serum NSE, MMP-9 and HER2 extracellular domain are associated with brain metastases in metastatic breast cancer patients: predictive biomarkers for brain metastases?', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Status in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker of Sensitivity in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Docetaxel Chemotherapy.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells as a Marker for Progression-free Survival in Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer.', 'Biomarkers in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Prognostic Value of HER2-Positive Circulating Tumor Cells in Breast Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Intermittent Hypoxia Mediates Paraspeckle Protein-1 Upregulation in Sleep Apnea.', 'Plasma Extracellular Vesicle-Derived TIMP-1 mRNA as a Prognostic Biomarker in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Pilot Study.', 'Research Advances in the Mechanism of Invasion and Metastasis of Circulating Tumor Cells in Lung Cancer.', 'Tumor Extracellular Matrix Remodeling: New Perspectives as a Circulating Tool in the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Solid Tumors.', 'Immunohistochemical analysis of matrix metalloproteinase-9 predicts papillary thyroid carcinoma prognosis.']"""

Here we designed a dual-target therapeutic system in which MSCs were engineered to produce and deliver scFv-Fdt-tBid, a novel γ-SM-targeted immunoproapoptotic molecule. Such engineered MSCs (MSC.scFv-Fdt-tBid) would home to tumor sites and release the fusion protein to induce the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.

Importantly, MSC.scFv-Fdt-tBid caused cell death through an apoptosis-dependent manner. Further, the tropism of MSC.scFv-Fdt-tBid to prostate cancer was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the in vivo experiments demonstrated that MSC.scFv-Fdt-tBid significantly inhibited γ-SM-positive tumor growth without toxic side effects.

However, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration has been examined more frequently at a younger age in Asia partially due to an increased awareness of prostate cancer. The purpose of our study was to investigate the efficacy and complication of PSA-triggered transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate (TRUSP) biopsies. We retrospectively reviewed TRUSP biopsies in young men with elevated PSA concentration in Taipei Veterans General Hospital.  Methods:   We reviewed the cases of patients younger than 50 years of age with elevated PSA concentration (>4.0 ng/mL), who received 12 cores TRUSP biopsies at TPEVGH from January 2008-December 2013. The age, family history, digital rectal examination (DRE) results, PSA concentration, free/total PSA ratio, total prostate volume, PSA density, lower urinary tract symptoms and complications after the procedure were reviewed. The pathologic findings of TRUSP biopsy and clinical follow-up were reviewed and analyzed according to the Epstein criteria.  Results:   A total of 77 patients were included and were divided into 2 groups: 1) the younger group consisted of 20 patients <40 years of age; and 2) the elder group had 57 patients who were 40-50 years of age. The overall detection rate of PCa was 11.69% (9/77), and all of the PCa cases were diagnosed in the elder group (group detection rate: 15.8%). There was a significant difference in the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) between these 2 groups. All PCa patients were clinically significant according to the Epstein criteria. Two patients experienced fever (2.60%) after TRUSP biopsy.  Conclusion:   From our patient cohort, it appears that no benefit was apparent for patients younger than 40 years old who received TRUSP biopsy, even with elevated PSA.

Materials and methods:   A total of 221 female and 176 male patients with urological chronic pelvic pain syndromes were recruited from 6 academic medical centers in the United States and evaluated at baseline with a comprehensive battery of symptom, psychosocial and illness-impact measures. Based on biweekly symptom reports, a functional clustering procedure classified participant outcome as worse, stable or improved on pain and urinary symptom severity. Cumulative logistic modeling was used to examine individual predictors associated with symptom change as well as multiple predictor combinations and interactions.  Results:   About 60% of participants had stable symptoms with smaller numbers (13% to 22%) showing clear symptom worsening or improvement. For pain and urinary outcomes the extent of widespread pain, amount of nonurological symptoms and poorer overall health were predictive of worsening outcomes. Anxiety, depression and general mental health were not significant predictors of outcomes but pain catastrophizing and self-reported stress were associated with pain outcome. Prediction models did not differ between men and women and for the most part they were independent of symptom duration and age.  Conclusions:   These results demonstrate for the first time in a large multisite prospective study that presence of widespread pain, nonurological symptoms and poorer general health are risk factors for poorer pain and urinary outcomes in men and women.

Objective:   Our aim is to identify the mechanisms responsible for AR-v7 production and to develop novel preclinical approaches to suppress the Enz-resistant (EnzR) PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   We established EnzR-PCa cell lines and examined the long noncoding RNA Malat1 (Malat1) function in conferring Enz resistance. We also examined the in vivo effects of Malat1 short interfering RNA and the AR-v7 degradation enhancer, ASC-J9®.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Enz resistance and expression of Malat1 and AR-v7. All statistical comparisons were analyzed with a t-test or one way analysis of variance followed by t-test.  Results and limitations:   We demonstrated that Malat1 is indispensable for Enz-induced AR-v7 production in VCaP and EnzR-C4-2 cells. We observed increased AR-v7 and Malat1 expression in our established EnzR-PCa cell lines and in some PCa patients who received Enz treatment. Targeting the Malat1/AR-v7 axis resulted in altering the PCa resistance to androgen deprivation therapy with Enz. The limitation of this study includes the small sample size from the same human patients before and after receiving Enz treatment.  Conclusions:   Targeting the Malat1/AR-v7 axis via Malat1-short interfering RNA or AR-v7 degradation enhancer ASC-J9® in EnzR-PCa cell lines and mouse models suppressed EnzR-PCa progression.  Patient summary:   Androgen deprivation therapy-enzalutamide treatment may not be the best choice for prostate cancer patients who have higher expression of the Malat1/androgen receptor splicing variant 7 axis, and new therapies using Malat1-short interfering RNA or ASC-J9® may be developed in the future to better suppress enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Ronghao Wang', 'Yin Sun', 'Lei Li', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Wanying Lin', 'Changyi Lin', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Jun Luo', 'Shuyuan Yeh', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate cancer: Escaping enzalutamide: Malat1 contributes to resistance.', 'ASC-J9(®) suppresses castration resistant prostate cancer progression via degrading the enzalutamide-induced androgen receptor mutant AR-F876L.', 'Preclinical studies using cisplatin/carboplatin to restore the Enzalutamide sensitivity via degrading the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7) to further suppress Enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) degradation enhancer ASC-J9® in an FDA-approved formulated solution suppresses castration resistant prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'The Crucial Role of AR-V7 in Enzalutamide-Resistance of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Genomic and Phenotypic Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Guidance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'MALAT1 Long Non-coding RNA and Its Role in Breast Carcinogenesis.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'Post-transcriptional modification of m6A methylase METTL3 regulates ERK-induced androgen-deprived treatment resistance prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and molecular significance of the RNA m6A methyltransferase complex in prostate cancer.']"""

After stratification by risk classification, CN provided a significant benefit on OS, compared to RE and NT, for patients with an intermediate risk (MSKCC). For those with a poor risk (Heng criteria), NT provided better survival than PFS (p=0.003), and a comparable survival to RE (p > 0.05).  Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis of 211 patients, 87 treated with IT and 124 with TT, retrieved from our RCC database. Patients' risk factors for survival was evaluated using the Heng and MSKCC criteria, with only patients with an intermediate or poor survival risk included in the analysis. Between-group comparisons were evaluated with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Conclusions:   The differential effect of CN and RE on OS appears to be modulated by risk classification. In patients with a poor risk, RE should be implemented after careful consideration of comorbidities and life expectancy.""","""['Sung Han Kim', 'Jung Kwon Kim', 'Boram Park', 'Jungnam Joo', 'Jae Young Joung', 'Ho Kyung Seo', 'Kang Hyun Lee', 'Jinsoo Chung']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Cytoreductive nephrectomy in patients with synchronous metastases from renal cell carcinoma: results from the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium.', 'Oncologic Outcomes of Cytoreductive Nephrectomy in Synchronous Metastatic Renal-Cell Carcinoma: A Single-Center Experience.', 'Systemic Treatments for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: 10-Year Experience of Immunotherapy and Targeted Therapy.', 'Prognostic value of cytoreductive nephrectomy combined with targeted therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a meta-analysis.', 'Cytoreductive Nephrectomy in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Treated With Targeted Therapies: A Systematic Review With a Meta-Analysis.', 'Postoperative Survival and Clinical Outcomes for Uterine Leiomyosarcoma Spinal Bone Metastasis: A Case Series and Systematic Literature Review.', 'Long-Term Survival Outcomes of Cytoreductive Nephrectomy Combined with Targeted Therapy for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between February 2014 and April 2016, 35 patients across two centres underwent RASND for 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT-detected oligometastatic nodal recurrence. RASND was performed using targeted pelvic dissection, unilateral extended pelvic template or bilateral extended pelvic template dissection, depending on previous pelvic treatment and extent/location of nodal disease. Complications were reported using the Clavien-Dindo classification system. Definitions of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) treatment response to RASND were defined as 6-week PSA <0.2 ng/mL (broad definition) or PSA <0.05 ng/mL (strict definition) in those who had undergone primary prostatectomy, and 6-week PSA level < post-radiotherapy nadir in those who had undergone primary radiotherapy. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RASND was defined as a PSA >0.2 ng/mL or PSA > nadir, for those who had undergone primary prostatectomy and primary radiotherapy, respectively. Predictors of treatment response were analysed using univariate binary logistic regression.  Results:   A total of 58 lesions suspicious for lymph node metastases (LNM) in 35 patients were detected on 68 Ga-PSMA imaging. A total of 32 patients (91%) had histopathologically proven LNM at RASND, with a total of 87 LNM and a median (interquartile range) of 2 (1-3) LNM per patient. In all, eight patients (23%) experienced complications, all Clavien-Dindo grade ≤2. Treatment response was seen in 15 (43%) and 11 patients (31%), using the broad and strict definitions, respectively. BCR-free survival and clinical recurrence-free survival at a median follow-up of 12 months were 23% and 66%, respectively, for the entire cohort. Bilateral template dissection was the only significant univariate predictor of treatment response in our cohort.  Conclusions:   Although RASND appears safe and feasible, less than half of our cohort had a treatment response, and less than a quarter experienced BCR-free survival at 12-month median follow-up. 68 Ga-PSMA imaging underestimates micro-metastatic disease, therefore RASND will rarely be curative. Strict patient selection and restricting RASND to clinical trials is recommended. Long-term follow-up from such trials is required to further assess potential quality of life and mortality benefits.""","""['Amila Siriwardana', 'James Thompson', 'Pim J van Leeuwen', 'Shaela Doig', 'Anton Kalsbeek', 'Louise Emmett', 'Warick Delprado', 'David Wong', 'Hemamali Samaratunga', 'Anne-Maree Haynes', 'Geoff Coughlin', 'Phillip Stricker']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Robot-assisted Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Clinically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Robotic salvage lymph node dissection for nodal-only recurrences after radical prostatectomy: Perioperative and early oncological outcomes.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Distribution of prostate cancer recurrences on gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (68 Ga-PSMA) positron-emission/computed tomography after radical prostatectomy with pathological node-positive extended lymph node dissection.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Metastasis-Directed Therapy for Oligometastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: An Alternative to ADT?', 'Design of a printed electrochemical strip towards miRNA-21 detection in urine samples: optimization of the experimental procedures for real sample application.', 'Role of PSMA PET-guided metastases-directed therapy in oligometastatic recurrent prostate cancer.', 'The impact of PSMA PET on the treatment and outcomes of men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) fusion imaging in prostate cancer: PET-CT vs PET-MRI.']"""

A high expression level of EphA2 predicts poor prognosis, correlating with disease progression and metastasis. Therefore, EphA2 is a relevant therapeutic target for human cancer. Antibodies, selectively bound to EphA2, can induce rapid receptor phosphorylation that results in antibody internalization and degradation. This internalization mechanism has been exploited with the development of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for cancer chemotherapy. In this study, we used PET imaging to study the pharmacokinetics and tumor delivery of a panel of anti-EphA2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with and without drug conjugates. Methods: A library of human anti-EphA2 mAbs were screened and evaluated for EphA2 internalization rate, binding affinity, epitope binding, and hydrophobicity. We chose 3 of these antibodies, denoted as 1C1, 3B10, and 2H7, which recognize different epitopes, for further evaluation. ADCs were generated by S239C mutation to give a ratio of 2 drug molecules per antibody. Native mAbs and ADCs were characterized, after conjugation to a DFO chelator and 89Zr radiolabeling, in assays including cell uptake, internalization, hydrophobicity, and in vivo imaging using PET. Results: All 3 mAbs had high affinities for EphA2 but exhibited different internalization rates following the order of 1C1 > 3B10 > 2H7. Internalization rate is only 1 factor that affects in vitro cell uptake and in vivo tumor accumulation. Interestingly, the hydrophobicity of the mAbs, which followed the order of 2H7 > 1C1 > 3B10, had a strong correlation with in vivo tumor uptake measured by PET, with the least hydrophobic antibody, 3B10, showing the highest tumor uptake. ADC significantly reduced the in vivo uptake of all 3 mAbs. Conclusion: Tumor uptake of mAb is a complex process that is affected by multiple parameters, including internalization, hydrophobicity, and chemical modification. Our results suggest that the addition of drug molecules to mAb increases the clearance of the mAb presumably due to the increased hydrophobicity. Understanding the complexity of antibody-based tumor delivery may help improve ADC engineering for better tumor targeting and reduced side effects.""","""['Orit Jacobson', 'Qing Li', 'Haojun Chen', 'Gang Niu', 'Dale O Kiesewetter', 'Lan Xu', 'Kimberly Cook', 'Gengcheng Yang', ""William Dall'Acqua"", 'Ping Tsui', 'Li Peng', 'Xiaoyuan Chen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Evaluation of Anti-LGR5 Antibodies by ImmunoPET for Imaging Colorectal Tumors and Development of Antibody-Drug Conjugates.', 'Quantitative radioimmunoPET imaging of EphA2 in tumor-bearing mice.', 'Molecular Imaging and Quantitation of EphA2 Expression in Xenograft Models with 89Zr-DS-8895a.', 'Application of Immuno-PET in Antibody-Drug Conjugate Development.', '89Zr-Immuno-Positron Emission Tomography in Oncology: State-of-the-Art 89Zr Radiochemistry.', 'Visualizing Galectin-3 Binding Protein Expression with ImmunoPET.', '18F-labeled FGFR1 peptide: a new PET probe for subtype FGFR1 receptor imaging.', 'Novel  111 InIn-BnDTPA-EphA2-230-1 Antibody for Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography Imaging Tracer Targeting of EphA2.', 'Fully human recombinant antibodies against EphA2 from a multi-tumor patient immune library suitable for tumor-targeted therapy.', 'Harnessing the Power of Eph/ephrin Biosemiotics for Theranostic Applications.']"""

The aim of this study was to optimize specific and total activity for 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in a syngeneic model of murine prostate cancer. Methods: Murine-reconstituted, oncogene-driven prostate cancer cells (0.1 × 106) (RM1), transduced to express human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), were injected into the left flank of C57Bl6 immunocompetent mice. RLT was performed by administering a single tail vein injection of 177Lu-PSMA-617 at different formulations for specific (60 MBq at high, 62 MBq/nmol; intermediate, 31 MBq/nmol; or low 15 MBq/nmol specific activity) or total activity (30, 60, or 120 MBq). Organ distribution was determined by ex vivo γ-counter measurement. DNA double-strand breaks were measured using anti-gamma-H2A.X (phospho S139) immunohistochemistry. Efficacy was assessed by serial CT tumor volumetry and 18F-FDG PET metabolic volume. Toxicity was evaluated 4 wk after the start of RLT. Results: Mean tumor-to-kidney ratios ± SEM were 19 ± 5, 10 ± 5, and 2 ± 0 for high, intermediate, and low (each n = 3) specific activity, respectively. Four of 6 (67%) mice treated with intermediate or high specific activity and none of 6 (0%) mice treated with low specific activity or formulation demonstrated significant DNA double-strand breaks (≥5% γ-H2A.X-positive cells). High when compared with intermediate or low specific activity resulted in a lower mean ± SEM tumor load by histopathology (vital tissue, 4 ± 2 vs. 8 ± 3 mm2; n = 3 vs. 6), day-4 18F-FDG PET (metabolic volume, 87 ± 23 vs. 118 ± 14 mm3; n = 6 vs. 12), and day-7 CT (volume, 323 ± 122 vs. 590 ± 46 mm3; n = 3 vs. 6; P = 0.039). 177Lu-PSMA-617 (120 MBq) with high specific activity induced superior tumor growth inhibition (P = 0.021, n = 5/group) without subacute hematologic toxicity (n = 3/group). Conclusion:177Lu-PSMA-617 (120 MBq) and high specific activity resulted in the highest efficacy in a syngeneic model of murine prostate cancer.

In this study, we propose 2 multimodal quantitative indices as imaging biomarkers for the assessment of osseous tumor burden using 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and present preliminary clinical data. Methods: We defined 2 bone PET indices (BPIs) that incorporate anatomic information from CT and functional information from 68Ga-PSMA PET: BPIVOL is the percentage of bone volume affected by tumor and BPISUV additionally considers the level of PSMA expression. We describe a semiautomatic computation method based on segmentation of bones in CT and of lesions in PET. Data from 45 patients with castration-resistant PC and bone metastases during 223Ra-dichloride were retrospectively analyzed. We evaluated the computational stability and reproducibility of the proposed indices and explored their relation to the prostate-specific antigen blood value, the bone scan index (BSI), and disease classification using PERCIST. Results: On the technical side, BPIVOL and BPISUV showed an interobserver maximum difference of 3.5%, and their computation took only a few minutes. On the clinical side, BPIVOL and BPISUV showed significant correlations with BSI (r = 0.76 and 0.74, respectively, P < 0.001) and prostate-specific antigen values (r = 0.57 and 0.54, respectively, P < 0.01). When the proposed indices were compared against expert rating using PERCIST, BPIVOL and BPISUV showed better agreement than BSI, indicating their potential for objective response evaluation.

Aim:   To examine testosterone kinetics in a large series of contemporary patients after EBRT.  Methods:   The study was conducted in 425 patients who underwent definitive EBRT for localized prostate cancer from 2002 through 2014. Patients were enrolled in several phase II and III trials. Exclusion criteria were neoadjuvant or adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy or missing data. Testosterone was recorded at baseline and then according to each study protocol (not mandatory in all protocols). Statistical analyses consisted of means and proportions, Kaplan-Meier plots, and logistic and Cox regression analyses.  Outcomes:   Testosterone kinetics after EBRT monotherapy and their influence on biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Median follow-up of 248 assessable patients was 72 months. One hundred eighty-six patients (75.0%) showed a decrease in testosterone. Median time to first decrease was 6.4 months. Median percentage of decrease to the nadir was 30% and 112 (45.2%) developed biochemical hypogonadism (serum testosterone < 8 nmol/L). Of all patients with testosterone decrease, 117 (62.9%) recovered to at least 90% of baseline levels. Advanced age, increased body mass index, higher baseline testosterone level, and lower nadir level were associated with a lower chance of testosterone recovery. Subgroup analyses of 166 patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy confirmed the results recorded for the entire cohort. In survival analyses, neither testosterone decrease nor recovery was predictive for biochemical recurrence.  Clinical implications:   EBRT monotherapy influences testosterone kinetics, and although most patients will recover, approximately 45% will have biochemical hypogonadism.  Strengths and limitations:   We report on the largest contemporary series of patients treated with EBRT monotherapy in whom testosterone kinetics were ascertained. Limitations are that testosterone follow-up was not uniform and the study lacked information on health-related quality-of-life data.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicate that up to 75% of patients will have a profound testosterone decrease, with up to a 40% increase in rates of biochemical hypogonadism, although the latter events will leave biochemical recurrence unaffected.

This retrospective analysis was performed to better understand its efficacy in routine clinical practice and identify factors associated with survival.  Materials and methods:   Sixty-four patients with mCRPC who received 223Ra between 2013 and 2015 were the basis of this retrospective study. Clinical outcomes and patient characteristics were obtained. Potential prognostic factors for survival were evaluated by univariate analysis using the log-rank test and multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard method.  Results:   The median survival was 12.9 months. Twenty-one patients (33%) developed a skeletal event, and the median time to the first skeletal event was 4.4 months. In univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with survival included: no prior chemotherapy, ≤ 5 bone metastases, baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 36 ng/mL, baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP) < 115 U/L, baseline hemoglobin > 12 g/dL, ALP response after 223Ra treatment, PSA decrease during 223Ra treatment, and absence of > 25% PSA increase during 223Ra treatment. In multivariate analysis, 4 factors remained significant: no prior chemotherapy, ≤ 5 bone metastases, baseline ALP < 115 U/L, and ALP response after 223Ra treatment.  Conclusion:   When 223Ra is administered in routine clinical practice, clinical outcomes can be more variable than those reported in the randomized study owing to patient heterogeneity.

Before precipitation of proteins with acetonitrile, samples were spiked with nilutamide (internal standard). Separation of analytes was achieved under isocratic elution on a C18 Kinetex column. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of ammonium acetate buffer (pH=4.6, 20mM) and acetonitrile (60:40, v/v), and was delivered at a flow rate of 1.5mL/min throughout a 9-min run. UV detection was performed at 270nm. The method was linear over a concentration range of 0.50-50.0μg/mL for both analytes. Within- and between-day imprecision and accuracy were ≤10% at concentrations 0.75, 5.00, and 50.0μg/mL. This method has been implemented to assay steady-state trough plasma concentrations (n=30) of enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide in 16 mCRPC patients. Overall, this HPLC-UV method is well-suited for routine application in clinical laboratories to perform therapeutic drug monitoring of enzalutamide in mCRPC patients.""","""['Alicja Puszkiel', 'Alain Plé', 'Olivier Huillard', 'Gaëlle Noé', 'Constance Thibault', 'Stéphane Oudard', 'François Goldwasser', 'Michel Vidal', 'Jérome Alexandre', 'Benoit Blanchet']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci""","""['Exposure-Response Assessment of Enzalutamide and Its Major Metabolites in a Real-World Cohort of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A HPLC-fluorescence method for the quantification of abiraterone in plasma from patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'RP-HPLC-UV Method for Simultaneous Quantification of Second Generation Non-Steroidal Antiandrogens Along with their Active Metabolites in Mice Plasma: Application to a Pharmacokinetic Study.', 'What do we know about treatment sequencing of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'Development of enzalutamide for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Review of Chromatographic Methods Coupled with Modern Detection Techniques Applied in the Therapeutic Drugs Monitoring (TDM).']"""

Therefore, it is necessary to identify molecular alterations to define new therapeutic strategies based on the risk of progression. In this study, the prognostic relevance of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system was examined in molecular subtypes defined by TMPRSS2-ERG (T2E) gene fusion within a series of patients with primary localized PCa.  Methods:   A cohort of 270 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary PCa samples from patients with more than 5 years' follow-up was collected. IGF-1R, IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and INSR expression was analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. The T2E status and immunohistochemical ERG findings were considered in the analyses. The association with both biochemical and clinical progression-free survival (BPFS and PFS, respectively) was evaluated for the different molecular subtypes using the Kaplan-Meier proportional risk log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   An association between IGF-1R overexpression and better BPFS was found in T2E-negative patients (35.3% BPFS, p-value = 0.016). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that IGF-1R expression constitutes an independent variable in T2E-negative patients [HR: 0.41. CI 95% (0.2-0.82), p = 0.013]. These data were confirmed using immunohistochemistry of ERG as subrogate of T2E. High IGF-1 expression correlated with prolonged BPFS and PFS independent of the T2E status.  Conclusions:   IGF-1R, a reported target of T2E, constitutes an independent factor for good prognosis in T2E-negative PCa. Quantitative evaluation of IGF-1/IGF-1R expression combined with molecular assessment of T2E status or ERG protein expression represents a useful marker for tumor progression in localized PCa.""","""['Caterina Mancarella', 'Irene Casanova-Salas', 'Ana Calatrava', 'Maria García-Flores', 'Cecilia Garofalo', 'Andrea Grilli', 'José Rubio-Briones', 'Katia Scotlandi', 'José Antonio López-Guerrero']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['ERG deregulation induces IGF-1R expression in prostate cancer cells and affects sensitivity to anti-IGF-1R agents.', 'Calcium Channel Blocker Use and Risk of Prostate Cancer by TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusion Status.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Integrative clinical transcriptome analysis reveals TMPRSS2-ERG dependency of prognostic biomarkers in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'ERG protein expression as a biomarker of prostate cancer.', 'A Mini-Review of Flavone Isomers Apigenin and Genistein in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Updates on Molecular and Biochemical Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Sub-zeptomole Detection of Biomarker Proteins Using a Microfluidic Immunoarray with Nanostructured Sensors.', 'Targeting the IGF-Axis for Cancer Therapy: Development and Validation of an IGF-Trap as a Potential Drug.', 'Expression of IGF/insulin receptor in prostate cancer tissue and progression to lethal disease.']"""

We aimed to elucidate the importance and relevant timing of obesity and weight change for prostate cancer progression. We identified 5,158 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (clinical stage T1/T2) from 1986 to 2012 in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Men were followed for biochemical recurrence and lethal prostate cancer (development of distant metastasis or prostate cancer-specific mortality) until 2012. Cox regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for body mass index (BMI) at age 21, BMI at diagnosis, ""long-term"" weight change from age 21 to diagnosis and ""short-term"" weight change over spans of 4 and 8 years preceding diagnosis. Because weight, weight change and mortality are strongly associated with smoking, we repeated analyses among never smokers only (N = 2,559). Among all patients, neither weight change nor BMI (at age 21 or at diagnosis) was associated with lethal prostate cancer. Among never smokers, long-term weight gain was associated with an increased risk of lethal disease (HR for gaining >30 pounds vs. stable weight [±10 pounds] 1.59, 95% CI, 1.01-2.50, p-trend = 0.06). Associations between weight change, BMI and lethal prostate cancer were stronger for men with BMI ≥ 25 at age 21 compared to those with BMI < 25. Weight change and obesity were not associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence. Our findings among never smoker men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer suggest a positive association between long-term weight gain and risk of lethal prostate cancer.

Methods:   Biopsy specimens from diagnosis until switching to radical prostatectomy in men initially on active surveillance in the Dutch part of the Prostate cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) study were collected and revised by a single pathologist. Original and revised biopsy Gleason score were compared and correlated with radical prostatectomy Gleason score. Biopsy specimens were immunohistochemically stained for Ki67 and ERG. Predictive ability of clinical characteristics and biomarkers on Gleason ≥7 or ≥pT3 on radical prostatectomy was tested using logistic regression and ROC curve analysis.  Results:   A total of 150 biopsies in 95 men were revised. In 13% of diagnostic or second-to-last biopsies and 20% of the last biopsies on active surveillance revision of Gleason score resulted in change of recommendation (ie, active treatment or active surveillance).

Ki67 and ERG were not statistically significant predictors of Gleason ≥7 or ≥pT3 on radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   Although interobserver differences in pathology reporting on biopsy could result in a change of management strategy in approximately 13-20% of men on active surveillance, both pathological revision and tested biomarkers (Ki67 and ERG) did not improve prediction of outcome on radical prostatectomy.

Controls, 207 African American (AA) and 133 PR were defined as men with no PCa, a serum PSA < 2.5 ng/mL and a negative rectal examination. Cases were patients with pathological specimens from radical prostatectomies (RP) (291 PR and 200 AA). DNA was extracted from whole blood of controls and from paraffin embedded normal seminal vesicle from the RPs. We assessed the association of PCa and aggressiveness with genetic ancestry using an ancestry informative marker panel (AIMs) and Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the association of PCa and aggressiveness with 15 previously PCa associated SNPs using Chi square test. Gleason Score (GS) and tumor stage (TS) were used to define low risk (GS ≤ 7[3 + 4]), TS ≤ pT2) and high risk (GS≥ 7[4 + 3], TS > pT2) PCa. Statistical analyses were done using SAS.  Results:   No difference in overall percent WAA was found between PR cases and controls. Among PR or AA cases WAA was not associated with disease severity based upon risk group, Gleason score or stage. Among AA controls WAA was significantly higher than in cases. The SNP rs7824364 (chromosome 8q24) PCa risk allele was significantly increased among cases versus controls for both AA (P < 0.0001) and PR (P = 0.0001) men.

Multivariate mixed effects regression analyses were used to construct and compare longitudinal trajectories of marginal predicted costs and predicted probabilities of MRU between cases and controls.  Results:   Among the controls, predicted monthly costs remained relatively stable throughout the entire observation period (weighted mean per patient per month, $2746; range during 24 months, $2603-2858). In contrast, among the cases, costs increased from $2622 (95% confidence interval [CI], $2525-2719) 12 months before the diagnosis of subsequent metastases to $4767 (95% CI, $4623-4910) 1 month before the diagnosis of subsequent metastases, peaked during the month of metastases at $13,291 (95% CI, $13,148-13,435), and remained significantly higher than costs for the controls thereafter (eg, $4677 at + 12 months; 95% CI, $4549-4805). Costs and MRU increased across a wide range of settings/types, including inpatient, outpatient, home health, and hospice settings.

Alterations in epigenetic mechanisms involved in MAGE gene silencing cause their frequent co-expression in tumor cells. Here, we have analyzed the effect of MAGE-A gene co-expression and our results suggest that MageA6 can potentiate the androgen receptor (AR) co-activation function of MageA11. Database search confirmed that MageA11 and MageA6 are co-expressed in human prostate cancer samples. We demonstrate that MageA6 and MageA11 form a protein complex resulting in the stabilization of MageA11 and consequently the enhancement of AR activity. The mechanism involves association of the Mage A6-MHD domain to MageA11, prevention of MageA11 ubiquitinylation on lysines 240 and 245 and decreased proteasome-dependent degradation. We experimentally demonstrate here for the first time that two MAGE-A proteins can act together in a non-redundant way to potentiate a specific oncogenic function.

Activation of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (HER1) in prostate cancer contributes to metastatic progression as well as to disease relapse. Here, we determined the toxicity and immunogenicity of a HER1-based cancer vaccine in CRPC patients included in a phase I clinical trial. CRPC patients (n = 24) were intramuscularly vaccinated with HER1 vaccine consisting of the extracellular domain of HER1 molecule (ECD) and very small size proteoliposome from Neisseria meningitidis (VSSP) and Montanide ISA-51 VG as adjuvants. Patients were included in five groups according to the vaccine dose (100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 μg). The primary endpoints were safety and immunogenicity. The anti-HER1 antibodies were measured by an ELISA, the recognition of an HER1 positive tumor cell line and the inhibition of HER1 phosphorylation by sera were determined by flow cytometry and western blot analysis, respectively. The HER1-specific T cell response was assessed by determination of IFN-γ-producing T cells using ELISpot assay. The vaccine was well tolerated. No grade III or IV adverse events were reported. High titers of anti-HER1 antibodies were observed in most of the evaluated patients. There were no significant differences regarding the geometric means of the anti-HER1 titers among the dose groups except the group of 100 μg in which antibody titers were significantly lower. A Th1-type IgG subclasses pattern was predominant in most patients. Only patients receiving the higher doses of vaccine showed significant tumor cell recognition and HER1 phosphorylation inhibition by hyperimmune sera. Forty two percent of the patients showed a specific T cell response against HER1 peptides pool in post-treatment samples.

A qualitative investigation into women's perspectives on employer and line manager support""","""Objectives:   To explore women's perspectives on what employers and managers should and should not do in relation to women going through the menopause.  Methods:   An online questionnaire was used to collect qualitative data in a cross-sectional study of working women. Three open-ended questions asked peri- and post-menopausal women, aged 45-65 years: (i) what they thought employers could do, or should do, to help menopausal women who may be experiencing difficult menopausal symptoms at work; (ii) how managers should behave; and (iii) how managers should not behave towards women going through the menopause.  Results:   137 women responded to the open questions in the survey. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted and three overarching themes emerged. Theme 1 related to employer/manager awareness, specifically to knowledge about the menopause and awareness of how the physical work environment might impact on menopausal women. Theme 2 related to employer/manager communication skills and behaviors, specifically those considered helpful and desired and those considered unhelpful and undesired. Theme 3 described employer actions, involving staff training and raising awareness, and supportive policies such as those relating to sickness absence and flexible working hours.  Conclusions:   The menopause can be difficult for some women to deal with at work, partly due to the working environment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore women's descriptions of how they would like to be treated by employers/managers, and what would be helpful and unhelpful. The results have clear implications for communication about menopause at work and for employer-level policy and practice.""","""['Claire Hardy', 'Amanda Griffiths', 'Myra S Hunter']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Maturitas""","""[""Menopause and work: an electronic survey of employees' attitudes in the UK."", 'Menopause in the workplace: What employers should be doing.', 'Study protocol of a multicentre randomised controlled trial of self-help cognitive behaviour therapy for working women with menopausal symptoms (MENOS@Work).', 'The perception of menopause among women in Taiwan.', ""Women's experience of menopause: a systematic review of qualitative evidence."", 'Effectiveness of workplace-based interventions to promote wellbeing among menopausal women: A systematic review.', ""Women's Health and Working Life: A Scoping Review."", 'Menopause and work: A narrative literature review about menopause, work and health.', 'Workplace Health Promotion Among Ethnically Diverse Women in Midlife With a Low Socioeconomic Position.', ""'Menopause affects us all . . .': menopause transition experiences of female ambulance staff from a UK ambulance service.""]"""

Prostate cancers, which bear this mutation, differ in a number of features, including tumor microenvironment. One of the components of the tumor microenvironment is FOXP3 positive lymphocytes, which may participate in breaking immunosurveillance and promoting tumor growth. The aim of the study was to analyze the relationships between ERG expression, number of FOXP3 positive cells and other features of the tumor. The study group consisted of 65 cases. Tissue microarrays composed of 2 mm tissue cores were used for immunohistological evaluation. Immunohistochemistry for ERG and FOXP3 was performed according to the routinely applied protocol. The FOXP3 positive cells were counted and the results were expressed as the number of cells per mm2. The average number of FOXP3 positive cells was 33.30/mm2 for all cases, 21.43/mm2 for the ERG negative and 42.28/mm2 for the ERG positive group (p < 0.02).

Monitoring resistance exercise intensity using ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) in previously untrained patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy. J Strength Cond Res 32(5): 1360-1365, 2018-Exercise has been shown to be safe and effective for patients with prostate cancer (PrCa). The monitoring of resistance exercise (RE) intensity is an emerging area of interest in RE prescription. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) is one of the most commonly used methods but has not yet been validated in this population. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between RPE and RE intensity in PrCa. Data for this study were abstracted from baseline upper- and lower-body strength assessments from 2 previous trials (Individual Diet and Exercise Adherence Pilot Trial; Livestrong, Austin, TX, USA) in our laboratory investigating functional outcomes in patients with PrCa undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). A total of 75 participants from both trials were included in this study. Ratings of perceived exertion corresponding to 50, 70, and 90% 1 repetition maximum (1RM) were extracted from the results of participants' upper- and lower-body 1RM strength tests. The changes in RPE across increasing intensities were assessed using separate univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). For each ANOVA, RPE was used as the dependent variable and intensity (50, 70, and 90%) used as the fixed factor. A univariate ANOVA revealed a significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) among the RPE values for each intensity for both upper- and lower-body lifts. The results of our analyses suggest that RPE values rise linearly in response to increases in exercise intensity. Our study supports the concept that RPE may be a practical training tool to accurately estimate RE intensity in PrCa survivors undergoing ADT. Practitioners may consider using RPE to monitor and adjust RE intensity in this population.""","""['Ciaran M Fairman', 'Richard L LaFountain', 'Alexander R Lucas', 'Brian C Focht']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Strength Cond Res""","""['Ratings of Perceived Exertion During Acute Resistance Exercise Performed at Imposed and Self-Selected Loads in Recreationally Trained Women.', 'Upper-Extremity Explosive Resistance Training With Older Adults Can Be Regulated Using the Rating of Perceived Exertion.', 'Efficacy of the Repetitions in Reserve-Based Rating of Perceived Exertion for the Bench Press in Experienced and Novice Benchers.', 'Rating of perceived exertion on resistance training in elderly subjects.', 'The use of ratings of perceived exertion for exercise prescription in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy.', 'Effect of home-based online training and activity feedback on oxygen uptake in patients after surgical cancer therapy: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Home-Based Preoperative Exercise Training for Lung Cancer Patients Undergoing Surgery: A Feasibility Trial.', 'Physical activity behaviour change in people living with and beyond cancer following an exercise intervention: a systematic review.', 'Feasibility and safety of physical exercise in men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy and radiotherapy: a study protocol.', 'Convergent Validity of Ratings of Perceived Exertion During Resistance Exercise in Healthy Participants: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

The direct relation between functional imaging characteristics and DPBN implies that random variations in images may propagate into the dose distribution. The stability of MR-only prostate cancer treatment planning based on DPBN with respect to these variations is as yet unknown. We conducted a test-retest study to investigate the stability of DPBN for prostate cancer in a semi-automated MR-only treatment planning workflow. Twelve patients received a multiparametric MRI on two separate days prior to prostatectomy. The tumor probability (TP) within the prostate was derived from image features with a logistic regression model. Dose mapping functions were applied to acquire a DPBN prescription map that served to generate an intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plan. Dose calculations were done on a pseudo-CT derived from the MRI. The TP and DPBN map and the IMRT dose distribution were compared between both MRI sessions, using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to quantify repeatability of the planning pipeline. The quality of each treatment plan was measured with a quality factor (QF). Median ICC values for the TP and DPBN map and the IMRT dose distribution were 0.82, 0.82 and 0.88, respectively, for linear dose mapping and 0.82, 0.84 and 0.94 for square root dose mapping. A median QF of 3.4% was found among all treatment plans. We demonstrated the stability of DPBN radiotherapy treatment planning in prostate cancer, with excellent overall repeatability and acceptable treatment plan quality. Using validated tumor probability modelling and simple dose mapping techniques it was shown that despite day-to-day variations in imaging data still consistent treatment plans were obtained.""","""['Marcel A van Schie', 'Peter Steenbergen', 'Cuong Viet Dinh', 'Ghazaleh Ghobadi', 'Petra J van Houdt', 'Floris J Pos', 'Stijn W T J P Heijmink', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Steffen Renisch', 'Torbjørn Vik', 'Uulke A van der Heide']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Robust treatment planning of dose painting for prostate cancer based on ADC-to-Gleason score mappings - what is the potential to increase the tumor control probability?', 'MRI-based treatment planning for radiotherapy: dosimetric verification for prostate IMRT.', 'Intensity modulated radiation therapy dose painting for localized prostate cancer using ¹¹C-choline positron emission tomography scans.', 'PET/CT imaging-guided dose painting in radiation therapy.', 'Physical radiotherapy treatment planning based on functional PET/CT data.', 'Plan Assessment Metrics for Dose Painting in Stereotactic Radiosurgery.', 'An investigation of the conformity, feasibility, and expected clinical benefits of multiparametric MRI-guided dose painting radiotherapy in glioblastoma.', 'Repeatability of radiotherapy dose-painting prescriptions derived from a multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging model of glioblastoma infiltration.', 'The feasibility of a dose painting procedure to treat prostate cancer based on mpMR images and hierarchical clustering.', 'Editorial: Online Adaptive MR-Guided Radiotherapy.']"""

Whether trends in assigning Gleason scores 2 through 4 vary by facility type and patient characteristics is unknown.  Objective:   - To assess trends in prostate cancer grading among various categories of treatment facilities.  Design:   - Analyses of National Cancer Database records from 1990 through 2013 for 434 612 prostate cancers diagnosed by core needle biopsy, including multivariable regression for 106 331 patients with clinical T1c disease diagnosed from 2004 through 2013.  Results:   - The proportion of prostate core needle biopsies with Gleason scores 2 through 4 declined from 11 476 of 53 850 (21.3%) (1990-1994) to 96 of 43 566 (0.2%) (2010-2013). The proportions of American Joint Committee on Cancer category T1c needle biopsies assigned Gleason scores 2 through 4 were 416 of 12 796 (3.3%) and 9 of 7194 (0.1%) during 2004 and 2013, respectively. Declines occurred earliest at National Cancer Institute-designated programs and latest at community programs. A multivariable logistic model adjusting for patient demographic and clinical variables and restricted to T1c cancers diagnosed in needle biopsies from 2004 through 2013 showed that facility type is independently associated with the likelihood of cancers in such specimens being assigned Gleason scores of 2 through 4, with community centers having a statistically significant odds ratio of 5.99 relative to National Cancer Institute-designated centers.

Less well known is the relative degree of sexual dysfunction and bother associated with ADT compared to other primary treatment modalities such as radical prostatectomy. We sought to describe the trajectory and relative magnitude of changes in sexual function and bother in men on ADT and to examine demographic and clinical predictors of ADT's adverse sexual effects.  Methods:   Prostate cancer patients treated with ADT (n = 60) completed assessments of sexual function and sexual bother 3 times during a 1-year period after the initiation of ADT. Prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy only and not receiving ADT (n = 85) and men with no history of cancer (n = 86) matched on age and education completed assessments at similar intervals.  Results:   Androgen deprivation therapy recipients reported worsening sexual function and increasing bother over time compared to controls. Effect sizes for the differences in sexual function were large to very large, and for bother were small to very large. Age younger than 83 years predicted relatively poorer sexual function, and age younger than 78 years predicted greater sexual bother at 12 months in men on ADT compared to men not on ADT.  Conclusions:   Most men on ADT for prostate cancer will never return to baseline levels of sexual function.

The predictors of combined PFS and OS were analyzed with a backward-stepwise multivariate Cox model.  Results:   Of the 69 patients, 46 received enzalutamide first, followed by abiraterone (E-A group), and 23 received abiraterone, followed by enzalutamide (A-E group).

Multivariate analysis demonstrated that pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values and age were significant predictors of longer combined PFS (P < 0.05). Likewise, multivariate analysis demonstrated that pretreatment hemoglobin values and performance status were significant predictors of longer OS (P < 0.05).

The recently identified AR splice variants (AR-Vs) have been considered as a plausible mechanism for the primary resistance against androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Sodium meta-arsenite (NaAsO2 ; KML001; Kominox), a trivalent arsenical, is an orally bioavailable and water soluble, which is currently in phase I/II clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer. It has a potent anti-cancer effect on prostate cancer cells and xenografts. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of NaAsO2 on AR signaling in LNCaP and 22Rv1 CRPC cells.  Methods:   We used hormone-sensitive LNCaP cells, hormone-insensitive 22Rv1 cells, and CRPC patient-derived primary cells. We analyzed anti-cancer effect of NaAsO2 using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining and CellTiter Glo® luminescent assay. Statistical evaluation of the results was performed by one-way ANOVA.  Results:   NaAsO2 significantly reduced the translocation of AR and AR-Vs to the nucleus as well as their level in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Besides, the level of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), downstream target gene of AR, was also decreased. This compound was also an effective modulator of AKT-dependent NF-κB activation which regulates AR. NaAsO2 significantly inhibited phosphorylation of AKT and expression and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. We then investigated the effect of NaAsO2 on AR stabilization. NaAsO2 promoted HSP90 acetylation by down-regulating HDAC6, which reduces the stability of AR in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Here, we show that NaAsO2 disrupts AR signaling at multiple levels by affecting AR expression, stability, and degradation in primary tumor cell cultures from prostate cancer patients as well as CRPC cell lines. These results suggest that NaAsO2 could be a novel therapeutics for prostate cancer.""","""['Yunlim Kim', 'Sang Eun Park', 'Jeong-Weon Moon', 'Bong-Min Kim', 'Ha-Gyeong Kim', 'In Gab Jeong', 'Sangjun Yoo', 'Jae Beom Ahn', 'Dalsan You', 'Jhang Ho Pak', 'Sujong Kim', 'Jung Jin Hwang', 'Choung-Soo Kim']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""[""Down-regulation of androgen receptor by 3,3'-diindolylmethane contributes to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in both hormone-sensitive LNCaP and insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells."", 'Combination of carmustine and selenite effectively inhibits tumor growth by targeting androgen receptor, androgen receptor-variants, and Akt in preclinical models: New hope for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination treatment with docetaxel and histone deacetylase inhibitors downregulates androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'The Crucial Role of AR-V7 in Enzalutamide-Resistance of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Anti-Tumor Effects of Sodium Meta-Arsenite in Glioblastoma Cells with Higher Akt Activities.', 'Pyrimethamine Elicits Antitumor Effects on Prostate Cancer by Inhibiting the p38-NF-κB Pathway.', 'Hormetic Dose Response of NaAsO2 on Cell Proliferation of Prostate Cells in Vitro: Implications for Prostate Cancer Initiation and Therapy.']"""

However, a concern in translating these results to clinic has been the presence of counter ions and their potential undesirable side effects (e.g., hypernatremia). In this work, we investigate tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, (THAM or Tris), a primary amine with no counter ion, for its effects on metastasis and progression in prostate and pancreatic cancer in vivo models using MRI and bioluminescence imaging. At an ad lib concentration of 200 mmol/L, Tris effectively inhibited metastasis in both models and furthermore led to a decrease in the expression of the major glucose transporter, GLUT-1. Our results also showed that Tris-base buffer (pH 8.4) had no overt toxicity to C3H mice even at higher doses (400 mmol/L).

Soft tissue contrast and Hounsfield units are impaired to the presence of scattered radiation. In our previous work, we proposed a high selectivity anti-scatter grid (ASG) as a possible solution to the problem. An alternative approach is the application of iterative scatter correction using deconvolution with scatter point spread function (PSF). The purpose of this work was to compare the performance of ASGs with different selectivity with and without the iterative and uniform scatter corrections in terms of CBCT image quality. A secondary objective of this study was to develop a novel measurement approach to measure the scatter point spread functions.  Methods:   The scatter PSF was modeled as a sum of two bivariate Gaussian functions. The PSF parameters were estimated from a series of transmission measurements through polystyrene slabs of varying thickness with lead partial beam-blocker for three different ASG designs ranging from low (5.6), medium (9), and high (11) selectivity. The scatter correction scheme is based on iterative convolution of the current estimate of the primary with the scatter PSF until the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the measured projection and the sum of the estimate of primary and scatter falls below a predefined threshold. The image quality was evaluated with the CIRS CBCT Image Quality and Electron Density phantom in a head and neck and pelvis configuration and the CIRS Virtual Male Human Patient. The image quality was quantified by the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) relative to the uncorrected scans and the root mean square deviation of the average gray values for different regions with respect to the nominal Hounsfield units and the mean difference of the reconstructed HU between the planning CT and CBCTs of the virtual human phantom.  Results:   For the head and neck phantom, the CNR increased with more advanced scatter correction algorithm and the ASG selectivity, reaching 3.9, 3.7, 3.5, and 3.1 for the high, medium, light, and with no grid configuration, respectively, combined with the iterative software correction. The same is true for the pelvis phantom with CNR improvement reaching 1.5 for the heavy and medium grid, 1.3 for the light grid, and 1.1 on its own. The HU RMSD for the head and neck phantom was 22 HU, 13 HU, 12 HU, and 6 HU for iterative correction without the grid, with the light grid, medium grid and the heavy grid, respectively. For same correction strategies, the values for the pelvis phantom where 170, 120, 34, and 27 HU. The average difference with the PCT of the virtual human phantom was 59 ± 48 HU and 63 ± 59 HU with scans reconstructed with the iterative correction and two higher selectivity grids. Visual inspection revealed similar trends for a head-and-neck and prostate cancer patient.  Conclusions:   The best scatter mitigation strategy was found to be a combination of a grid with selectivity larger than 9, combined with iterative scatter estimation. None of the investigated grids required increasing the imaging dose. The PSF determined using proposed method leads to image quality improvements results for all but one of the investigated scenarios.""","""['Uros Stankovic', 'Lennert S Ploeger', 'Marcel van Herk', 'Jan-Jakob Sonke']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Improved image quality of cone beam CT scans for radiotherapy image guidance using fiber-interspaced antiscatter grid.', '3D-printed large-area focused grid for scatter reduction in cone-beam CT.', 'Evaluation of scatter rejection and correction performance of 2D antiscatter grids in cone beam computed tomography.', 'The principles and effectiveness of X-ray scatter correction software for diagnostic X-ray imaging: A scoping review.', 'Quality assurance phantoms for cone beam computed tomography: a systematic literature review.', 'Artifact removal for unpaired thorax CBCT images using a feature fusion residual network and contextual loss.', 'Investigation of the origin of scatter components transmitted through anti-scatter grids in X-ray Digital Imaging system using Monte Carlo Simulation.', 'Scatter Corrections in X-Ray Computed Tomography: A Physics-Based Analysis.', 'Generating synthetic CT from low-dose cone-beam CT by using generative adversarial networks for adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Comparison of Supervised and Unsupervised Approaches for the Generation of Synthetic CT from Cone-Beam CT.']"""

In addition to the previous reports from aerial parts of this plant, studies related to antiproliferative or antimicrobial activity from the roots are warranted.  Objective:   To investigate antiproliferative and antimicrobial activity of compounds/mixture (1-8) isolated and characterized from the roots of O. biennis L. A possible mechanism of antiproliferative activity was also studied by targeting ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and cathepsin D (CATD).  Study design:   Antiproliferative efficacy of the compounds/mixture was examined in selected cancer cell lines along with their probable mechanism of action. The antimicrobial activity was also studied against selected microbes (bacteria and fungi).  Methods:   Antiproliferative potential was evaluated by MTT assay against selected cell lines. The mechanism of action was studied spectrophotometrically by targeting ODC and CATD using both an in-vitro and an in-silico approach. The antimicrobial efficiency was analysed using the disc diffusion and broth dilution methods.  Key findings:   Oenotheralanosterol B (3) and the mixture of oenotheralanosterol A and oenotheralanosterol B (4) exhibited antiproliferative activity against breast, hepatic, prostate and leukaemia cancer cell lines as well as in mouse macrophages (IC50 8.35-49.69 μg/ml). Oenotheralanosterol B (3) and the mixture of oenotheralanosterol A and oenotheralanosterol B (4) displayed a strong molecular interaction with succinate dehydrogenase (binding energy -6.23 and -6.84 kcal/mol and Ki 27.03 and 9.6 μm, respectively). Oenotheralanosterol A (1), oenotheralanosterol B (3) and mixture of oenotheralanosterol A and oenotheralanosterol B (4) potently inhibited the ODC activity with IC50 ranging from 4.65 ± 0.35 to 19.06 ± 4.16 μg/ml and also showed a strong interaction with ODC (BE -4.17 to -4.46 kcal/mol). Oenotheralanosterol A (1), cetoleilyl diglucoside (2), oenotheralanosterol B (3), dihydroxyprenylxanthone acetylated (6) and dihydroxyprenylxanthone (7) inhibited CATD activity (IC50 3.95 ± 0.49 to 24.35 ± 2.89 μg/ml). The in-silico molecular interaction analysis of compounds with CATD revealed the non-specific interaction. A moderate antimicrobial activity was observed against selected microbes with a growth inhibition ranging from 6 to 14 mm and minimum inhibitory concentration between 125 and 500 μg/ml. Oenotheralanosterol B (3) and dihydroxyprenylxanthone acetylated (6) exhibited better antimicrobial activity with an MIC range from 62.50 to 500 μg/ml.  Conclusion:   Oenotheralanosterol B (3) exhibited stronger antiproliferative and antimicrobial potential with respect to the other compounds tested, whereas oenotheralanosterol A (1) was a potent inhibitor of ODC and CATD. Hence, it is suggested that these in-vitro findings could be studied further in vivo for biological activity, safety evaluation and derivatization to enhance potency and efficacy.""","""['Shilpi Singh', 'Vijaya Dubey', 'Dhananjay Kumar Singh', 'Kaneez Fatima', 'Ateeque Ahmad', 'Suaib Luqman']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Pharm Pharmacol""","""['HILIC quantification of oenotheralanosterol A and B from Oenothera biennis and their suppression of IL-6 and TNF-α expression in mouse macrophages.', 'Phytochemical and Biological Screening of Oenothera Biennis L.

Recently, homeobox protein Hox-B13 (HOXB13) has been suggested as a new marker for the detection of prostatic origin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of HOXB13 in comparison to commonly used immunohistochemical markers for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Histologically confirmed prostate cancer lymph node metastases from 64 cases were used to test the diagnostic value of immunohistochemical markers: prostate specific antigen (PSA), Prostatic acid phosphatase (PSAP), prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), homeobox gene NKX3.1, prostein, androgen receptor (AR), HOXB13, and ETS-related gene (ERG). All markers were evaluated semi-quantitatively using Remmele's immune reactive score.  Results:   The detection rate of prostate origin of metastasis for single markers was 100% for NKX3.1, 98.1% for AR, 84.3% for PSMA, 80.8% for PSA, 66% for PSAP, 60.4% for HOXB13, 59.6% for prostein, and 50.0% for ERG.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that HOXB13 on its own lacks sensitivity for the detection of prostatic origin. Therefore, this marker should be only used in conjunction with other markers, preferably the highly specific PSA. The combination of PSA with NKX3.1 shows a higher sensitivity and thus appears preferable in this setting.""","""['Ilka Kristiansen', 'Carsten Stephan', 'Klaus Jung', 'Manfred Dietel', 'Anja Rieger', 'Yuri Tolkach', 'Glen Kristiansen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Performance of different prostate specific antibodies in the cytological diagnosis of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'HOXB13 protein expression in metastatic lesions is a promising marker for prostate origin.', 'Differential expression of NKX 3.1 and HOXB 13 in bone metastases originating from prostatic carcinoma among the Egyptian males.', 'Insight into the heterogeneity of prostate cancer through PSA-PSMA prostate clones: mechanisms and consequences.', 'Current use of PSMA-PET in prostate cancer management.', 'Histopathological Aspects of the Prognostic Factors for Salivary Gland Cancers.', 'Diagnostic pitfalls: a case of prostate cancer and rectal cancer accompanied by prostate cancer invasion of the rectum.', 'Tissue immunostaining of candidate prognostic proteins in metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Expression of NKX3.1, Prostatic Specific Antigen and Prostatic Specific Alkaline Phosphatase in Cytology Specimens of Metastatic Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Delineating the Molecular Events Underlying Development of Prostate Cancer Variants with Neuroendocrine/Small Cell Carcinoma Characteristics.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 7,051 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between September 1998 and December 2016 in Western Australia were divided into a high grade group, defined as Gleason sum 4 + 3, 8 and 9 or greater and ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) groups 3, 4 and 5, and a low grade group, defined as Gleason sum 6 or less and 3 + 4, and ISUP groups 1 and 2. The t-test and the Pearson chi-square test were used to evaluate differences between transition zone and peripheral/central zone cancer. The Kaplan-Meier method with the log rank test was used to determine differences in biochemical recurrence-free survival at 5 years in patients with high grade disease. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed. Model calibration was determined by the internal validation method.  Results:   High grade transition zone cancer was associated with significantly increased prostate specific antigen, tumor volume and incidence of positive surgical margins but a lower incidence of intraductal carcinoma, extraprostatic spread, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement and biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy. Patients with low grade prostate cancer had excellent biochemical recurrence-free survival regardless of tumor origin. The high grade multivariable model had a c-index of 0.78 and improved predictive accuracy, particularly for high grade transition zone disease.  Conclusions:   Transition zone tumor origin independently and positively impacts biochemical outcomes of high grade prostate cancer.

The limited survival benefit associated with the quick emergence of resistance and systemic toxicity diminishes its efficacy in high-dose monotherapy. YK-4-279 is a small molecule inhibitor of ETV1 that plays an important role in the progression of prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that the combination of docetaxel and YK-4-279 will have a synergistic effect on inhibiting growth and accelerating apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. Methods: Cell growth assessed using CCK-8 and trypan blue exclusion assays. Cell apoptosis was determined by morphological assessment in cells stained with propidium iodide. Standard scratch migration and Matrigel-coated transwell invasion assays were used to assess cell migration and invasion, respectively. Western blotting was used to investigate the levels of ETV1, AR, PSA, p-STAT3, survivin, Bcl-2, and p-Akt in prostate cancer cells. Results: The combination of low-dose docetaxel and YK-4-279 synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. The combination also more efficiently suppressed the migration and invasion of LNCaP and PC-3 cells. The combination of low-dose docetaxel and YK-4-279 caused a stronger decrease in the levels of ETV1, AR, PSA, p-STAT3, survivin, Bcl-2, and p-Akt in LNCaP cells and of p-Akt, Bcl-2, and p-STAT3 in PC-3 cells compared with either drug alone. Conclusions: These data suggest that the combination of docetaxel and YK-4-279 may be an effective approach for inhibiting the growth and metastasis of prostate cancer. This could permit a decrease in the docetaxel dose necessary for patients with CRPC and thereby lower its systemic toxicity.""","""['Lin Yu', 'Xiaofeng Wu', 'Min Chen', 'Huarong Huang', 'Yan He', 'Huaqian Wang', 'Dongli Li', 'Zhiyun Du', 'Kun Zhang', 'Susan Goodin', 'Xi Zheng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Med Sci""","""['GLIPR1-ΔTM synergizes with docetaxel in cell death and suppresses resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer cells.', 'Synergistic antitumor effect of NVP-BEZ235 and sunitinib on docetaxel-resistant human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'EGFR mediates docetaxel resistance in human castration-resistant prostate cancer through the Akt-dependent expression of ABCB1 (MDR1).', 'Emerging targets to monitor and overcome docetaxel resistance in castration resistant prostate cancer (review).', 'PIM1 kinase as a target in prostate cancer: roles in tumorigenesis, castration resistance, and docetaxel resistance.', 'The DNA/RNA helicase DHX9 contributes to the transcriptional program of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Nobiletin, a citrus polymethoxyflavone, enhances the effects of bicalutamide on prostate cancer cells via down regulation of NF-κB, STAT3, and ERK activation.', 'Synergistic Interaction between 5-FU and an Analog of Sulforaphane-2-Oxohexyl Isothiocyanate-In an In Vitro Colon Cancer Model.', 'Ultrasound-Targeted Microbubble Destruction-Mediated Downregulation of EZH2 Inhibits Stemness and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Liver Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Function and regulation of the PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors in cancer.']"""

Expression of two markers was chosen to represent stromal (CD31) and epithelial (Ki-67) compartments in prostate cancer. IHC was performed on whole-slide sections representing low-, intermediate-, and high-grade disease from 15 patients. The automated workflow was developed using a training set of regions-of-interest in sequential tissue sections. Protein expression was studied on digital representations of IHC images across entire slides representing formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks. Using the training-set, the known association between Ki-67 and Gleason grade was confirmed. CD31 expression was more heterogeneous across samples and remained invariant with grade in this cohort. Interestingly, the Ki-67/CD31 ratio was significantly increased in high (Gleason ≥ 8) versus low/intermediate (Gleason ≤7) samples when assessed in the training-set and the whole-tissue block images. Further, the feasibility of the automated approach to process Tissue Microarray (TMA) samples in high throughput was evaluated. This work establishes an initial framework for automated analysis of co-localized protein expression and distribution in high-resolution digital microscopy images based on standard IHC techniques. Applied to a larger sample population, the approach may help to elucidate the biologic basis for the Gleason grade, which is the strongest, single factor distinguishing clinically aggressive from indolent prostate cancer.""","""['Thomas A Tennill', 'Mitchell E Gross', 'Hermann B Frieboes']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['PBOV1 as a potential biomarker for more advanced prostate cancer based on protein and digital histomorphometric analysis.', 'E-cadherin expression in prostate cancer: a broad survey using high-density tissue microarray technology.', 'Tissue microarray sampling strategy for prostate cancer biomarker analysis.', 'PSCA, Cox-2, and Ki-67 are independent, predictive markers of biochemical recurrence in clinically localized prostate cancer: a retrospective study.', 'Validation of tissue microarray technology in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours.', 'Intravoxel incoherent motion predicts positive surgical margins and Gleason score upgrading after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Comparing the expression profiles of steroid hormone receptors and stromal cell markers in prostate cancer at different Gleason scores.', 'PBOV1 as a potential biomarker for more advanced prostate cancer based on protein and digital histomorphometric analysis.']"""

Materials and methods:   One hundred nine men with intermediate- (n = 52) or high-risk (n = 57) PCa who underwent RP were retrospectively identified. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of PCA3 score with various APFs (eg, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, etc.). Among 78 men with ≥1 year of follow-up, the association between PCA3 score and PFS was assessed using Cox regression analysis.  Results:   At RP, 52% of patients had at least 1 APF, and with median follow-up of 2.3 years, overall 3-year PFS was 70%. PCA3 was not a significant predictor of any APF on multivariate analysis (MVA), whereas canonical predictors (eg, biopsy Gleason score and initial prostate-specific antigen) remained predictive of various APFs. No significant predictors for PFS were found on MVA, although certain canonical predictors (eg, National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group) were significant predictors of PFS on univariate analysis (UVA). PCA3 score was not a significant predictor of PFS on either UVA or MVA.  Conclusion:   Unlike in lower risk cohorts, increasing PCA3 score was not associated with any APF in this higher risk cohort, despite enrichment for APFs, nor was it associated with PFS. Notably, multiple known preoperative predictors for APFs were significant on MVA, and multiple predictors were associated with PFS on UVA. Therefore, PCA3 may not be a useful adjunct predictive marker in men with intermediate- or high-risk PCa.""","""['John V Hegde', 'Darlene Veruttipong', 'Jonathan W Said', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Christopher R King', 'Amar U Kishan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Prognostic accuracy of Prostate Health Index and urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 in predicting pathologic features after radical prostatectomy.', 'Predictors of adverse pathologic features after radical prostatectomy in low-risk prostate cancer.', 'PCA3 score before radical prostatectomy predicts extracapsular extension and tumor volume.', 'Blood-based and urinary prostate cancer biomarkers: a review and comparison of novel biomarkers for detection and treatment decisions.', 'PCA3 in the detection and management of early prostate cancer.']"""

We compared the effect of primary external beam radiation therapy vs radical prostatectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 2,935 elderly men 65 years old or older in the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare linked database who underwent external beam radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer. Propensity adjusted Cox proportional hazard and regression models were fit to examine urinary and gastrointestinal toxicities, the use of androgen deprivation therapy, and overall and prostate cancer specific mortality.  Results:   A total of 1,429 men (48.69%) underwent radical prostatectomy and had a median followup of 11.47 years (IQR 6.17-17.17) years. A total of 1,506 men (51.31%) received external beam radiation therapy and had a median followup of 7.04 years (IQR 4.11-10.51, p <0.001). Patients treated with radical prostatectomy were at significantly higher risk for urinary and sexual toxicities (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.66-2.24 and HR 5.50, 95% CI 3.59-8.42, respectively). However, they were at lower risk for gastrointestinal toxicities (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.86) than those treated with external beam radiation therapy. Radical prostatectomy was associated with lower odds of androgen deprivation therapy 5 years after primary treatment (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.69, p <0.001).

The viability of PC-3 cells was analyzed with the MTT assay and ANNEXIN V/propidium iodide staining. The actions of pCramoll or rCramoll on mitochondrial superoxide production, free cytosolic calcium concentration and mitochondrial membrane potential were evaluated using fluorescent probes (MitoSox Red, Fura 2-AM and safranin O, respectively). pCramoll and rCramoll reduced the viability of PC-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Both lectins increased the generation of mitochondrial superoxide as well as the concentration of cytosolic calcium. These changes led to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation, which impaired the formation of ATP. The resulting cell death was not blocked by MPT (mitochondrial permeability transition) inhibitors (Debio 025 or bongkrekic acid).

Androgen receptor activity plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Although accumulating evidence suggests that general anesthetics, including opioids, affect cancer cell growth and impact patient prognosis, the effect of those drugs on androgen receptor in prostate cancer is not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the general anesthetic propofol on androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer cells. An androgen-dependent human prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) was stimulated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and exposed to propofol. The induction of androgen receptor target genes was investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and androgen receptor protein levels and localization patterns were analyzed using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assays. The effect of propofol on the proliferation of LNCaP cells was analyzed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Propofol significantly inhibited DHT-induced expression of androgen receptor target genes in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assays indicated that propofol suppressed nuclear levels of androgen receptor proteins. Exposure to propofol for 24h suppressed the proliferation of LNCaP cells, whereas 4h of exposure did not exert significant effects.

Methods:   A total of 62 biopsy-naive patients referred to a systematic transrectal ultrasound biopsy (TRUS-bx) due to suspicion of PCa were prospectively enrolled. Bp-MRI was performed before biopsy. All lesions were scored according to the modified Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2. All patients underwent TRUS-bx followed by bp-MRI-guided biopsies (bp-MRI-bx) under MRI/TRUS image fusion from any bp-MRI suspicious lesions not obviously targeted by TRUS-bx.  Results:   PCa was found in 42 (68%) and 32 (52%) patients by TRUS-bx and bp-MRI-bx, respectively. Bp-MRI-bx de-tected PCa in one patient who had been missed by TRUS-bx, and found the highest Gleason score (GS) in 13 (30%) patients leading to an overall GS upgrade in six (14%) patients. Bp-MRI missed nine patients with GS = 6 and two with a GS = 7 (3 + 4), all of whom were diagnosed by TRUS-bx.  Conclusions:   Addition of bp-MRI-bx to routine TRUS-bx seems feasible in biopsy-naive patients and may improve the detection of aggressive PCa in first-round biopsies. This pilot study thus provides an incentive for a larger investigation.  Funding:   Costs were covered by the Department of Radiology, Herlev Hospital, Denmark.

Several miRNAs have been reported to be associated with PCa. This study was undertaken to identify miRNAs that act as a tumor suppressor by targeting ERG. We collected 70 PCa and paired adjacent non-tumor (Adjacent-N) tissues and analyzed ERG expression by immunohistochemistry(IHC). Expression of 6 miRNAs (miR-21,-34a,-96,-125b,-150 and miR-1271) was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to examine miRNA binding to the 3'-UTR of target genes. The effects of ectopic expression of miRNA on cell growth and MAPK signaling pathway were investigated in in PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines. Among 70 PCa cases, 13 (18.6%) were ERG positive. No significant difference of miR-34a, 96, 125b, and 150 expression was found between PCa and Adjacent-N tissues. Significantly higher level of miR-21 and lower level of miR-1271 expression were found in cancer tissues. Furthermore, miR-1271 was down-regulated in ERG-positive PCa cases (p < 0.05). Based on luciferase reporter assay, we identified ERG gene as a direct target gene for miR-1271. Transfection of a miR-1271 mimics into PC-3 and LNCaP cells repressed the ERG expression and significantly suppressed cell growth. Lastly, ectopic expression of miR-1271 inhibits AKT1, p38gama and CREB kinase activity. Our results suggested that reduced expression of miR-1271 may be involved in the ERG expression and that miR-1271 could be a therapeutic target for ERG-positive prostate cancer patients.""","""['Miao Wang', 'Wei Gao', 'Dehong Lu', 'Lianghong Teng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Pathol Oncol Res""","""['MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'miR-152 controls migration and invasive potential by targeting TGFα in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'The tumor suppressive miR-200b subfamily is an ERG target gene in human prostate tumors.', 'Loss of miR-449a in ERG-associated prostate cancer promotes the invasive phenotype by inducing SIRT1.', 'MicroRNAs and prostate cancer.', 'Circ_0011373 promotes papillary thyroid carcinoma progression by regulating miR-1271/LRP6 axis.', 'The Emerging Roles of Circ-ABCB10 in Cancer.', 'microRNA-1271 impedes the development of prostate cancer by downregulating PES1 and upregulating ERβ.', 'What turns CREB on?

GRP78 is generally expressed at low concentrations, but is increased by physiological stress. GRP78 is thought to protect against tissue or organ damage under pathological conditions, such as neurotoxic stress, myocardial infarction, or arteriosclerosis. In addition, in tumors, GRP78 expression is much higher than in normal tissues. Furthermore, high levels of GRP78 expression have been shown to increase the risk of malignancy and metastasis in prostate and colon cancer. Because both anticancer drugs and down-regulation of GRP78 expression inhibit cancer progression and growth, we hypothesized that down-regulation of GRP78 expression might lead to enhanced susceptibility of cancer cells to cytotoxic action of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).  Materials and methods:   GRP78 expression was suppressed in LoVo colon cancer cells by utilizing small-interfering RNA (si-GRP78), and the cells were subsequently used to study the antiproliferative and anticancer effects of 5-FU treatment. The signaling pathways responsible for the increase of LoVo cell susceptibility to 5-FU treatment after exposure to GRP78 siRNA were determined by western blot.  Results:   GRP78 silencing significantly inhibited cell viability and increased apoptosis of LoVo cells. Furthermore, combined treatment with 5-FU and GRP78 siRNA for 12 h reduced cell viability, and increased apoptosis and generation reactive oxygen species more strongly than either of the two treatments applied separately. In order to examine the role of ER stress in increased susceptibility of LoVo cells to 5-FU after pretreatment with GRP78 siRNA, we analyzed expression levels of ER stress marker proteins, such as phosphorylated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α), phosphorylated p38, and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Treatment with 5-FU alone increased the expression of ER stress marker proteins, whereas combined exposure to both 5-FU and GRP78 siRNA led to an even stronger effect on these markers. Similar to the pattern of modulation of ER stress protein expression, the levels of apoptosis-related proteins were also more strongly affected by combined exposure to 5-FU and GRP78 siRNA than by single treatments. In particular, expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) were increased, whereas the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) was reduced by these treatments.  Conclusion:   GRP78 silencing and incubation with 5-FU have synergistic effects on the inhibition of LoVo colon cancer cell growth via the induction of ER stress-dependent apoptosis.""","""['Seungpil Yun', 'Yong-Seok Han', 'Jun Hee Lee', 'Sangmin Kim', 'Sang Hun Lee']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['GRP78 Regulates Apoptosis, Cell Survival and Proliferation in 5-Fluorouracil-resistant SNUC5 Colon Cancer Cells.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress induces 5-fluorouracil resistance in human colon cancer cells.', 'Asperuloside exhibits a novel anti-leukemic activity by triggering ER stress-regulated apoptosis via targeting GRP78.', 'Stress induction of GRP78/BiP and its role in cancer.', 'Roles of Grp78 in Female Mammalian Reproduction.', 'Development and validation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related eight-gene signature for predicting the overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Long Non-coding RNA MIAT Knockdown Prevents the Formation of Intracranial Aneurysm by Downregulating ENC1 via MYC.', 'ROS-Dependent ER Stress and Autophagy Mediate the Anti-Tumor Effects of Tributyltin (IV) Ferulate in Colon Cancer Cells.', 'Long non-coding RNA XIST binding to let-7c-5p contributes to rheumatoid arthritis through its effects on proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts via regulation of STAT3.', 'Lnc HAGLR Promotes Colon Cancer Progression Through Sponging miR-185-5p and Activating CDK4 and CDK6 in vitro and in vivo.']"""

Materials and methods:   Focal therapy was performed in patients presenting with Gleason score 3 + 3 or 3 + 4, clinical stage cT2a or less, serum prostate specific antigen 15 ng/ml or less, unilateral positive biopsy, maximum length of any positive core less than 10 mm and life expectancy greater than 10 years. Focal therapy was defined as target ablation of the index lesion plus a 1 cm safety margin in the normal ipsilateral prostatic parenchyma. The salvage group included 22 men who underwent salvage prostatectomy after focal therapy failure. The primary group was defined using matched pair 1:2 selection of 44 of 2,750 patients treated with primary prostatectomy. The primary and secondary end points were the between group differences in functional and oncologic outcomes, respectively.  Results:   Complication rates were comparable (p >0.05). Pad-free probability was comparable between the groups at 1 and 2 years (p = 0.8). Recovery of erectile function was significantly lower after salvage robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (p = 0.008), which also showed a significantly lower probability of cumulative biochemical recurrence-free survival compared to primary robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (56.3% vs 92.4% at 2 years, p = 0.001). Salvage prostatectomy demonstrated a significantly increased risk of biochemical recurrence (HR 4.8, 95% CI 1.67-13.76, p = 0.004). Study limitations included the retrospective nature, the lack of randomization and the short followup.  Conclusions:   Salvage robotic assisted radical prostatectomy after focal therapy failure is feasible with acceptable complication rates. However, patients assigned to primary focal therapy should be advised about a poorer prognosis in terms of oncologic control and lower erectile recovery rates in case of a future salvage surgery.""","""['Igor Nunes-Silva', 'Eric Barret', 'Victor Srougi', 'Mohammed Baghdadi', 'Paolo Capogrosso', 'Silvia Garcia-Barreras', 'Solange Kanso', 'Rafael Tourinho-Barbosa', 'Ariê Carneiro', 'Rafael Sanchez-Salas', 'François Rozet', 'Marc Galiano', 'Xavier Cathelineau']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Re: Effect of Prior Focal Therapy on Perioperative, Oncologic and Functional Outcomes of Salvage Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: I.

Materials and methods:   Using a cadaveric model, multifocal PCa was simulated using 2 MRI-compatible fiducial markers. These were inserted transrectally and used to generate regions of interests (ROIs) on a 1.5-T surface-coil MRI. The first marker was placed in the right mid-peripheral zone (ROI 1), and the second marker was placed in the left seminal vesicle as a referent lesion for subsequent imaging. MRI of the specimen was then obtained. The radiologist created ROIs using fusion biopsy system at each marker. Two additional incidental ROIs were identified in the left transitional zone (ROI 2-suspicious for benign prostatic hyperplasia nodule) and in the right anterior peripheral zone (ROI 3-suspicious for PCa). Holmium laser enucleation of the transitional zone of the prostate was performed to gain access to the peripheral zone lesions. MUF was used during endoscopic laser excision to convey targeting accuracy. The cadaver was then reimaged to determine the adequacy of resection and examined for histopathologic correlation.  Results:   Real-time MUF imaging identified the target lesions consistently at the locations designated as ROIs. Complete endoscopic resection of ROIs was possible.

We aimed to improve causal inference in a Mendelian Randomization meta-analysis using nested case-control studies of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC, 623 cases, 623 matched controls), the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, 231 cases, 230 controls) and the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, 399 cases, 774 controls) with available data on pre-diagnostic adiponectin concentrations and selected single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ADIPOQ gene. We created an ADIPOQ allele score that explained approximately 3% of the interindividual variation in adiponectin concentrations. The ADIPOQ allele score was not associated with risk of colorectal cancer in logistic regression analyses (pooled OR per score-unit unit 0.97, 95% CI 0.91, 1.04). Genetically determined twofold higher adiponectin was not significantly associated with risk of colorectal cancer using the ADIPOQ allele score as instrumental variable (pooled OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.40, 1.34). In a summary instrumental variable analysis (based on previously published data) with higher statistical power, no association between genetically determined twofold higher adiponectin and risk of colorectal cancer was observed (0.99, 95% CI 0.93, 1.06 in women and 0.94, 95% CI 0.88, 1.01 in men). Thus, our study does not support a causal effect of circulating adiponectin on colorectal cancer risk.

Methods:   In total, 438 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were included in this study. Blood samples including AST and ALT were collected 1-7 days before surgery. An elevated AST and ALT value was defined as over 40 or 56 IU/L.  Results:   The median AST and ALT value was 18.5 (16-22) and 14 (11-18) IU/L. In total, 15 patients (3.4%) and 9 patients (2.1%) exhibited elevated AST value and ALT value. The median De Ritis ratio was 1.33 (1.11-1.60), and ROC curve indicated the best cutoff of 1.325 in predicting the occurrence of biochemical recurrence. Higher De Ritis ratio was found to be related to older age (p < 0.001), higher tumor stages (p < 0.001) and Gleason Score (p < 0.001), presence of seminal invasion (p < 0.001), positive surgical margin (p < 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.003). Multivariate logistic regression confirmed that De Ritis ratio was an independent predictor for final Gleason Score (p < 0.001), and multivariate Cox regression demonstrated De Ritis ratio as an independent risk factor for BCRFS. A simple predictive model which incorporated De Ritis ratio, pathological tumor stage and final Gleason Score could help risk stratification for BCRFS.

The TRPM8 channel has recently been proposed to play a protective role in prostate cancer by impairing cell motility. However, the mechanisms by which it could influence vascular behavior are unknown. Here, we reveal a novel non-channel function for TRPM8 that unexpectedly acts as a Rap1 GTPase inhibitor, thereby inhibiting endothelial cell motility, independently of pore function. TRPM8 retains Rap1 intracellularly through direct protein-protein interaction, thus preventing its cytoplasm-plasma membrane trafficking. In turn, this mechanism impairs the activation of a major inside-out signaling pathway that triggers the conformational activation of integrin and, consequently, cell adhesion, migration, in vitro endothelial tube formation, and spheroid sprouting. Our results bring to light a novel, pore-independent molecular mechanism by which endogenous TRPM8 expression inhibits Rap1 GTPase and thus plays a critical role in the behavior of vascular endothelial cells by inhibiting migration.""","""['Tullio Genova', 'Guillaume P Grolez', 'Chiara Camillo', 'Michela Bernardini', 'Alexandre Bokhobza', 'Elodie Richard', 'Marco Scianna', 'Loic Lemonnier', 'Donatella Valdembri', 'Luca Munaron', 'Mark R Philips', 'Virginie Mattot', 'Guido Serini', 'Natalia Prevarskaya', 'Dimitra Gkika', 'Alessandra Fiorio Pla']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Cell Biol""","""['Role of the small GTPase Rap1 for integrin activity regulation in endothelial cells and angiogenesis.', 'Breast cancer cell migration is regulated through junctional adhesion molecule-A-mediated activation of Rap1 GTPase.', 'Rap1 Spatially Controls ArhGAP29 To Inhibit Rho Signaling during Endothelial Barrier Regulation.', 'Regulation of angiogenesis by a small GTPase Rap1.', 'Regulation of lymphocyte adhesion and migration by the small GTPase Rap1 and its effector molecule, RAPL.', 'Cold temperature induces a TRPM8-independent calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum in human platelets.', 'JP1 normalizes tumor vasculature to suppress metastasis and facilitate drug delivery by inhibiting IL-8.', 'Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) Channel as a Sensor of Oxidative Stress in Cancer Cells.', 'Effect of TRPM8 Functional Loss on Corneal Epithelial Wound Healing in Mice.', 'Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) Channels in Tumor Vascularization.']"""

Materials and methods:   Eighty CT-guided bone biopsy specimens were obtained from 72 men (median age, 68 y; range, 49-89 y) enrolled in a multicenter trial to identify mechanisms of resistance in mCRPC. Successful biopsy was determined by histologic confirmation of tumor cells and successful isolation of RNA for molecular analysis.  Results:   The overall success rate of CT-guided bone biopsies was 69% (55/80) based on histology and 64% (35/55) based on isolation of molecular material for RNA sequencing. Biopsies performed in lesions with areas of radiolucency had significantly higher diagnostic yields compared with lesions of predominantly dense sclerosis (95% vs 33%; P = .002) and lesions of predominantly subtle sclerosis (95% vs 65%; P = .04). Success rates increased in lesions with density ≤ 475 HU (79% for ≤ 475 HU vs 33% for > 475 HU; P = .001) and in lesions with ill-defined margins (76% for ill-defined margins vs 36% for well-circumscribed margins; P = .005).

In this study, the plan quality for prostate cancer generated by the Auto-Planning module of the Pinnacle3 radiation therapy treatment planning system (v9.10, Fitchburg, WI) is retrospectively evaluated. The Auto-Planning module of Pinnacle3 uses a progressive optimization algorithm. Twenty-three prostate cancer cases, which had previously been planned and treated without lymph node irradiation, were replanned using the Auto-Planning module. Dose distributions were statistically compared with those of manual planning by the paired t-test at 5% significance level. Auto-Planning was performed without any manual intervention. Planning target volume (PTV) dose and dose to rectum were comparable between Auto-Planning and manual planning. The former, however, significantly reduced the dose to the bladder and femurs. Regression analysis was performed to examine the correlation between volume overlap between bladder and PTV divided by the total bladder volume and resultant V70. The findings showed that manual planning typically exhibits a logistic way for dose constraint, whereas Auto-Planning shows a more linear tendency. By calculating the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to validate the statistical model, a reduction of interoperator variation in Auto-Planning was shown. We showed that, for prostate cancer, the Auto-Planning module provided plans that are better than or comparable with those of manual planning.
