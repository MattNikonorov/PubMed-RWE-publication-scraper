Present work is aimed at the formulation of a freeze-dried diaminedithiol-peptide (N2S2-TP3805) kit and it's evaluation for the preparation of 64Cu labeled TP3805. Parameters such as pH, temperature and incubation time were examined that influenced the radiolabeling efficiency and stability of the product.  Methods:   Kits were prepared under different conditions and radiolabeling efficiency of TP3805 kit was evaluated for a range of pH3.5-8.5, after addition of 64Cu in 30μl, 0.1M HCl. Incubation temperature (37-90°C) and time (30-120min.) were also investigated. Kits were stored at -10°C and their long term stability was determined as a function of their radiolabeling efficiency. Further, stability of 64Cu-TP3805 complex was evaluated in presence of fetal bovine serum and bovine serum albumin by using SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Kits were then used for PET imaging of BC and PC following eIND (101550) and institutional approvals. Specificity of 64Cu-TP3805 for VPAC1 was examined with digital autoradiography (DAR) of prostate tissues obtained after prostatectomy, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue, and benign and malignant lymph nodes. Results were compared with corresponding tissue histology.  Results:   Radiolabeling efficiency was ≥95% at final pH ~7.2 when incubated at 50°C for 90min. Kits were stable up to 18months when stored at -10°C, and 64Cu-TP3805 complex exhibited excellent stability for up to 4h at room temperature. 64Cu-TP3805 complex did not show any transchelation even after 2h incubation at 37°C in 10% FBS as well as in BSA as determined by SDS PAGE analysis. DAR identified ≥95% of malignant lesions 11 new PC lesions, 20 high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, 2/2 ejaculatory ducts and 5/5 urethra verumontanum not previously identified The malignant lymph nodes were correctly identified by DAR and for 3/3 BPH patients, and 5/5 cysts, DAR was negative. In human BC (n=19) and PC (n=26) were imaged with 100% sensitivity.  Conclusion:   Availability of ready to use N2S2-peptide kits for 64Cu labeling is convenient and eliminates possible day to day variation during its routine preparation for clinical use.""","""['Sushil K Tripathi', 'Pardeep Kumar', 'Edouard J Trabulsi', 'Sung Kim', 'Peter A McCue', 'Charles Intenzo', 'Adam Berger', 'Leonard Gomella', 'Mathew L Thakur']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Targeting VPAC1 Receptors for Imaging Glioblastoma.', 'VPAC1 Targeted (64)Cu-TP3805 Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Prostate Cancer: Preliminary Evaluation in Man.', 'VPAC1 receptors for imaging breast cancer: a feasibility study.', 'VPAC1-targeted PET/CT scan: improved molecular imaging for the diagnosis of prostate cancer using a novel cell surface antigen.', 'An Update on Extemporaneous Preparation of Radiopharmaceuticals Using Freeze-Dried Cold Kits.', 'Theragnostic Radionuclide Pairs for Prostate Cancer Management: 64Cu/67Cu, Can Be a Budding Hot Duo.', 'Targeting VPAC1 Receptors for Imaging Glioblastoma.', 'Less Exploited GPCRs in Precision Medicine: Targets for Molecular Imaging and Theranostics.']"""

A population-based cohort study in New South Wales""","""Background:   Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia have been found to have poorer cancer survival than non-Aboriginal people. However, use of conventional relative survival analyses is limited due to a lack of life tables. This cohort study examined whether poorer survival persist after accounting for competing risks of death from other causes and disparities in cancer stage at diagnosis, for all cancers collectively and by cancer site.  Methods:   People diagnosed in 2000-2008 were extracted from the population-based New South Wales Cancer Registry. Aboriginal status was multiply imputed for people with missing information (12.9%). Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 'advanced stage' at diagnosis (separately for distant and distant/regional stage). Survival was examined using competing risk regression to compute subhazard ratios (SHRs) with 95%CIs.  Results:   Of the 301,356 cases, 2517 (0.84%) identified as Aboriginal (0.94% after imputation). After adjusting for age, sex, year of diagnosis, socio-economic status, remoteness, and cancer site Aboriginal peoples were more likely to be diagnosed with distant (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.17-1.44) or distant/regional stage (OR 1.29, 95%CI 1.18-1.40) for all cancers collectively. This applied to cancers of the female breast, uterus, prostate, kidney, others (those not included in other categories) and cervix (when analyses were restricted to cases with known stages/known Aboriginal status). Aboriginal peoples had a higher hazard of death than non-Aboriginal people after accounting for competing risks from other causes of death, socio-demographic factors, stage and cancer site (SHR 1.40, 95%CI 1.31-1.50 for all cancers collectively). Consistent results applied to colorectal, lung, breast, prostate and other cancers.  Conclusions:   Aboriginal peoples with cancer have an elevated hazard of cancer death compared with non-Aboriginal people, after accounting for more advanced stage and competing causes of death. Further research is needed to determine reasons, including any contribution of co-morbidity, lifestyle factors and differentials in service access to help explain disparities.""","""['Hanna E Tervonen', 'Richard Walton', 'Hui You', 'Deborah Baker', 'David Roder', 'David Currow', 'Sanchia Aranda']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Differences in impact of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status on cancer stage and survival by level of socio-economic disadvantage and remoteness of residence-A population-based cohort study in Australia.', 'Breast screening and breast cancer survival in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women of Australia.', 'Disparities in breast screening, stage at diagnosis, cancer treatment and the subsequent risk of cancer death: a retrospective, matched cohort of aboriginal and non-aboriginal women with breast cancer.', 'Cancer in aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia.', 'Self-reported health-related quality-of-life issues for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients with experience of cancer in Australia: a review of literature.', 'Does breast cancer policy meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in Australia? a review.', 'The effect of general practice contact on cancer stage at diagnosis in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal residents of New South Wales.', 'Factors associated with cancer survival disparities among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples compared with other Australians: A systematic review.', 'Quantifying the number of deaths among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cancer patients that could be avoided by removing survival inequalities, Australia 2005-2016.', 'Using data linkage to enhance the reporting of cancer outcomes of\xa0Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in NSW, Australia.']"""

This work defines workflows for offline CT and online 3DUS planning scenarios and preclinical end-to-end validation of the platform.  Methods and materials:   The platform is composed of an EM-tracked stylet, a EM-tracked 3DUS probe, and an EM-tracked template guide, all used with the NDI Aurora field generator (NDI, Ontario, Canada). The treatment planning system performs continuous position and angular readings from all three EM sensors into a streamlined environment that allows for (1) contouring; (2) planning; (3) catheter insertion guidance and reconstruction; (4) QA of catheter path and tip position; and (5) exporting to an afterloader. Data were gathered on the times required for the various key steps of the 3DUS-based workflow.  Results:   The complete 3DUS-based workflow on 16-catheter implant phantoms took approximately 15 min. This time is expected to increase for actual patients. Plan generation is fast (7.6 ± 2.5s) and the initial catheter reconstruction with updated dose distribution is obtained at no (time) cost as part of the insertion process. Subsequent catheter reconstruction takes on average 10.5 ± 3.1s per catheter, representing less than 3 min for a 16-catheter implant.  Conclusions:   This preclinical study suggests that EM technology could help to significantly streamline real-time US-based high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.""","""['Luc Beaulieu', 'Emmanuel Racine', 'Dae Yup Han', 'Eric Vigneault', 'I-Chow Hsu', 'J Adam M Cunha']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Validation of a novel robot-assisted 3DUS system for real-time planning and guidance of breast interstitial HDR brachytherapy.', 'Electromagnetic tracking for catheter reconstruction in ultrasound-guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy of the prostate.', 'An integrated system for clinical treatment verification of HDR prostate brachytherapy combining source tracking with pretreatment imaging.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

To report our experience with sRP for selected patients with local recurrence after primary treatment for localised PCa.  Methods:   From 2005 to 2015, 24 patients underwent sRP for recurrent PCa in our center and were included in this retrospective study. Local recurrence was suspected by PSA increase>nadir+2ng/mL and was confirmed by biopsy. Perioperative complications according to Clavien-Dindo classification, oncological and functional results were analysed.  Results:   Overall, 24 patients with a median age of 59 years (IQR: 55-60) were included. Median follow-up was 25 months (IQR: 9-26). Procedures were performed with open-retropubic approach in 50 % and robot-assisted laparoscopic approach in 50 %. Overall, 5 (21 %) and 2 (8 %) patients experienced grade≤IIIa and grade≥IIIb postoperative complication, respectively. Surgical margins were positive in 46 % of cases. Three out of 4 patients with postoperatively detectable PSA (>0.2ng/mL) had positive surgical margins. Seven patients experienced biochemical recurrence in a median delay of 19 months (9-62). Seventy-one percent (5) of these patients experienced clinical recurrence in a median delay of 24 months (10-113). Severe urinary incontinence (≥3 pads/day) and erectile dysfunction were reported in 25 % and 63 %, respectively.

Methodology:   A retrospective cohort of 1577 afro-caribbean patients undergoing radical prostatectomy operated between 1st January 2000 and 1st July 2013 was analyzed. In this cohort, 406 patients had positive surgical margin, we excluded 11 patients who received adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy, hormonotherapy, radio-hormonotherapy) and 2 patients for whom histological analysis of the surgical specimen was for a pT4 pathological stage. After a descriptive analysis, we used a Cox model to look for predictors of survival without biochemical recurrence then, depending on the significant variables, we separated our population into six groups: stage pT2 with Gleason score≤3+4 (group 1), stage pT2 with a score of Gleason≥4+3 (group 2), stage pT3a with a Gleason core≤3+4 (group 3), pT3a stage with a score of Gleason≥4+3 (group 4), stage pT3b with a Gleason score≤3+4 (group 5) and stage pT3b Gleason≥with a score of 4+3 (group 6) and compared survival without biochemical recurrence using a log rank test. After radical prostatectomy with surgical margins with an anatomopathological stage≤pT3b, a Gleason score≥4+3 had a pejorative survival without biochemical recurrence than pathological stage (P<0.001).  Results:   In multivariate analysis, predictors of survival without biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy with positive surgical margins were the majority Gleason postoperative (P<0.0001), pathological stage (P=0.049) adjusted preoperative PSA (P=0.826), with the body mass index (BMI) (P=0.59) and tumor volume (P=0.95).

The aims of this study was to estimate the biokinetics and dosimetry of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA (99mTc-labeled PSMA inhibitor) in eight healthy subjects and evaluate its usefulness as a tumor-imaging agent in eight prostate cancer patients.  Methods: 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA was obtained from a lyophilized formulation with radiochemical purities >98%, determined by reversed-phase HPLC and ITLC-SG analyses. Whole-body images from eight healthy subjects were acquired at 20min, and at 2, 6 and 24h after 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA administration. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around the source organs on each time frame. Each ROI was corrected by background, attenuation, scattered radiation and physical decay. The image sequence was used to extrapolate the 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA time-activity curves of each organ to adjust the biokinetic model and calculate the total number of disintegrations (N) that occurred in the source regions. N data were the input for the OLINDA/EXM code to calculate internal radiation doses. In eight prostate cancer patients with histologically confirmed cancer, whole-body SPECT/CT images were obtained at 3h.  Results:   The blood activity showed a half-life value of 4.98min for the fast component (T1/2α=ln2/8.34), 2.49h for the first slow component (T1/2β=ln2/0.278), and 9.24h for the second slow component (T1/2γ=ln2/0.076). Images from patients showed an average tumor/background ratio of 8.99±3.27 at 3h.

A southern Italian experience""","""Introduction:   The 11C/18F-choline is a PET/CT radiopharmaceutical useful in detecting tumors with high lipogenesis. 11C/18F-choline uptake can occur in physiological conditions or tumors. The knowledge of its bio-distribution is essential to recognize physiologic variants or diagnostic pitfalls. Moreover, few information are available on the bio-distribution of this tracer in female patients. Our aim was to discuss some documented 18F-choline PET/CT pitfalls in prostate cancer patients. Our secondary aim was to describe the 18F-choline bio-distribution in the female body.  Methods:   We collected diagnostic pitfalls in three PET centers examining 1000 prostate cancer by 18F-choline PET/CT. All pitfalls were ensured by follow-up, imaging and/or histology. We also performed whole body 18F-choline PET/CT in 5 female patients.  Results:   169/1000 (16.9%) patients showed pitfalls not owing to prostate cancer. These findings were due to inflammation, benign tumors while, in 1% of examined patients, a concomitant neoplasm was found. In the female body, the breast showed low physiological uptake.  Conclusions:   The accurate knowledge of 18F-choline PET/CT bio-distribution and diagnostic pitfalls is essential. Correlative imaging and histological exam are often necessary to depict pitfalls. In women, the uptake in the breast is due to the physiological gradient of 18F-choline uptake in the exocrine glands.  Advances in knowledge:   Our results confirm the possibility of 18F-choline uptake in several diseases other than prostate cancer. However, our experience was acquired on a large population and shows that a conspicuous amount of 18F-choline diagnostic pitfalls are easily recognizable and attributable to inflammation. A new advance in knowledge is the minimal difference in terms of physiological tracer bio-distribution between male and female patients.  Implications for patient care:   The knowledge of the physiological bio-distribution and of the potential pitfalls linked of a tracer could help physicians to choose the best diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for a better patient quality of life.""","""['Ferdinando Calabria', 'Agostino Chiaravalloti', 'Carmelo Cicciò', 'Vincenzo Gangemi', 'Domenico Gullà', 'Federico Rocca', 'Gianpasquale Gallo', 'Giuseppe Lucio Cascini', 'Orazio Schillaci']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Bio-Distribution, Imaging Protocols and Diagnostic Accuracy of PET with Tracers of Lipogenesis in Imaging Prostate Cancer: a Comparison between 11C-Choline, 18FFluoroethylcholine and 18F-Methylcholine.', '18F-choline PET/CT physiological distribution and pitfalls in image interpretation: experience in 80 patients with prostate cancer.', 'PET/CT analysis of 21 patients with breast cancer: physiological distribution of 18F-choline and diagnostic pitfalls.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Multitracer PET/CT with 18FFluorodeoxiglucose and 18FFluorocholine in the Initial Staging of Multiple Myeloma Patients Applying the IMPeTus Criteria: A Pilot Study.', 'Incidental Findings on 18 F-Fluorocholine PET/CT for Parathyroid Imaging.', 'Vaccine-Related Lymph Nodes: The Emerging Pitfalls of 18F-Fluorocholine and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in the Era of COVID-19 Vaccination.', 'Differential Diagnosis of Hepatic Mass with Central Scar: Focal Nodular Hyperplasia Mimicking Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'The Role of Molecular Imaging in a Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Patient: A Narrative Review in the Era of Multimodality Treatment.']"""

Methods:   Data were drawn from the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago. Social supports were measured by asking the frequency of receipt of support from spouse, non-spouse family members, and friends. Use of cancer screenings were evaluated by asking the history of utilization of colon, breast, cervical, and prostate cancer screenings.  Results:   After adjusting for covariates, results indicated significant association between higher social support and higher utilization of cancer screenings. Regarding to different sources of social support, higher levels of social supports from family members (odds ratio [OR], 1.15 [1.07, 1.25]) and friends (OR, 1.14 [1.06, 1.23]) were associated with higher utilization of breast cancer screening. However, higher levels of social support from family members (OR, 0.94 [0.88, 0.99]) and friends (OR, 0.94 [0.88, 1.00]) were associated with lower utilization of colon cancer screening.

To our knowledge, few Chinese studies investigated the association between physical activity and prostate cancer and none between physical activity and bladder cancer. Given the inconsistencies between previous studies and because studies on the relation between physical activity and prostate and bladder cancer in China are scarce, it remains elusive whether there is a relationship between physical activity and prostate and bladder cancer within the Chinese population.  Methods:   We investigated the association between physical activity and risk of developing prostate and bladder cancer within a hospital-based case-control study in the East and South of China among 260 and 438 incident prostate and bladder cancer cases, respectively, and 427 controls. A questionnaire was administered to measure physical activity as metabolic equivalents (METs). Random effects logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) of prostate and bladder cancer for different levels of physical activity and for the specific activities of walking and cycling.  Results:   Increasing overall physical activity was associated with a significant reduction in prostate cancer risk (Ptrend = 0.04) with the highest activity tertile level showing a nearly 50% reduction in prostate cancer risk (OR = 0.53, 95%CI: 0.28-0.98). Overall physical activity was not significantly associated with risk of bladder cancer (Ptrend = 0.61), neither were vigorous (Ptrend = 0.60) or moderate levels of physical activity (Ptrend = 0.21). Walking and cycling were not significantly associated with either prostate (Ptrend> = 0.62) or bladder cancer risk (Ptrend> = 0.25).

At present, four of six sections have received accreditation by AIRTUM (53% of regional population). To point out possible regional geographic variability in cancer incidence and also to support health services planning, we developed an original estimation method to ensure a complete territorial coverage. Incidence data of the four accredited RTP sections for the shared incidence period 2006-2008, the 2001-2009 hospitalization regional data, and 2006-2009 mortality data were considered. To take into account specific health features of different provinces, we performed an estimate of cancer incidence rates of nonaccredited sections using a combination of accredited sections rates and a factor that combines mortality and hospitalization ratios available for all the sections. Finally, we validated the method and we applied it to estimate regional cancer rates as the population-weighted average of accredited sections and nonaccredited sections adjusted rates. The validation process shows that estimated rates are close to real incidence data. The most frequent neoplasms in Apulia are breast (direct standardized rates 96.8 per 100 000 inhabitants), colon-rectum (36.6), and thyroid cancer (25.3) in women and prostate (70.2), lung (68.4), and colon-rectum cancer (52.2) in men.

MYCN amplification in childhood neuroblastoma (NB) is associated with aggressive disease and high mortality. Novel and effective therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed for these tumors. MYC-driven oncogenic transformation impairs cell survival under nutrient deprivation (ND), a characteristic stress condition within the tumor microenvironment. We recently identified eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 Kinase (eEF2K) as a pivotal mediator of the adaptive response of tumor cells to ND. We therefore hypothesized that eEF2K facilitates the adaptation of MYCN amplified NB to ND, and that inhibiting this pathway can impair MYCN-driven NB progression. To test our hypothesis, we first analyzed publicly available genomic databases and tissue microarrays for eEF2K expression in NB, and for links between eEF2K, MYCN, and clinical outcome in NB. Effects of eEF2K inhibition were evaluated on survival of MYCN amplified versus non-amplified NB cell lines under ND. Finally, NB xenograft mouse models were used to confirm in vitro observations. Our results indicate that high eEF2K expression and activity are strongly predictive of poor outcome in NB, and correlates significantly with MYCN amplification. Inhibition of eEF2K markedly decreases survival of MYCN amplified NB cell lines in vitro under ND. Growth of MYCN amplified NB xenografts is markedly impaired by eEF2K knockdown, particularly under caloric restriction. In summary, eEF2K protects MYCN overexpressing NB cells from ND in vitro and in vivo, highlighting this kinase as a critical mediator of the adaptive response of MYCN amplified NB cells to metabolic stress.""","""['Alberto Delaidelli', 'Gian Luca Negri', 'Asad Jan', 'Brandon Jansonius', 'Amal El-Naggar', 'Jonathan K M Lim', 'Debjit Khan', 'Htoo Zarni Oo', 'Christopher J Carnie', 'Marc Remke', 'John M Maris', 'Gabriel Leprivier', 'Poul H Sorensen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Death Differ""","""['eEF2K protects MYCN-amplified cells from starvation.', 'miR-15a-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-16-5p inhibit tumor progression by directly targeting MYCN in neuroblastoma.', 'CTCF cooperates with noncoding RNA MYCNOS to promote neuroblastoma progression through facilitating MYCN expression.', 'MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma maintains an aggressive and undifferentiated phenotype by deregulation of estrogen and NGF signaling.', 'Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K) signaling in tumor and microenvironment as a novel molecular target.', 'Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase confers tolerance to stress conditions in cancer cells.', 'Translation of non-canonical open reading frames as a cancer cell survival mechanism in childhood medulloblastoma.', 'Structure of the complex between calmodulin and a functional construct of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase bound to an ATP-competitive inhibitor.', 'ADP enhances the allosteric activation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase by\xa0calmodulin.', 'High-Level MYCN-Amplified RB1-Proficient Retinoblastoma Tumors Retain Distinct Molecular Signatures.', 'Inhibition of eEF2K synergizes with glutaminase inhibitors or 4EBP1 depletion to suppress growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells.']"""

We evaluated the percentage of identification of neurovascular bundles using NIR fluorescence. Then, we evaluated complications related to injection of ICG and operative time differences between RARP with and without ICG injection performed by the same surgeons.  Results:   We identified prostatic arteries and neurovascular bundles using NIR fluorescence technology in all patients (100%). There was not any increase in the operative time compared with RARP without ICG injection performed by the same surgeons. Complications related to injection of ICG did not occurred.

In the present study, the topographic distribution of nerves around the prostate and their relative distances from the prostatic capsule were analyzed in male cadaver visceral blocs.  Methods:   The pelvic organs from ten fresh male cadavers were removed and serial sectioned en bloc for histological investigation. The macroslices was divided into four sectors. Each sector was centrally covered with a raster dividing each sector in three subsectors numbered clockwise. The prostatic capsule was identified, and distances of 2.5 and 5 mm from the prostate were demarked with lines. We quantified the number of nerve fibers present in each subsector of each slide and recorded their position relative to the prostatic capsule.  Results:   In general, the topographic analysis revealed that the majority of nerves were identified in sectors 4 through 9, corresponding to the posterolateral and posterior surfaces of the prostate gland. At the prostate base, the majority of nerves were found at the posterolateral and posterior surfaces of the gland. Within the mid-region of the prostate, the same topographic distribution pattern was observed, but the nerve fibers were closer to the prostatic capsule. At the apical region, the percentage of nerve fibers identified in the anterior region was higher, despite their major concetration in the posterior surface. The nerves identified at the apex were mainly located up to 2.5 mm from the prostate. This proximity to the prostate was specifically observed in the anterolateral and anterior sectors. In the craniocaudal sense, the percentage of nerves identified between 2.5 and 5 mm from the prostatic capsule remained constant.  Conclusions:   A significant number of nerve fibers were present in the anterior and anterolateral positions, especially at the apex. The anterior nerves were closer to the prostate. This proximity suggests that the anterior nerves may participate in local physiology and that the cavernous nerves are probably formed by the posterior nerve fibers. It is likely that the safe distance of 2.5 mm from all surfaces of the prostate may be related to cavernous fiber preservation.""","""['Tiago M Rodrigues', 'Anuar I Mitre', 'Luiz Fernando F da Silva', 'Lísias N Castilho', 'Fabiano A Simões', 'Paulo H N Saldiva', 'Miguel Srougi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Neuroanatomical study of periprostatic nerve distributions using human cadaver prostate.', 'Immunohistochemical study of the cavernous nerves in the periprostatic region.', 'Periprostatic distribution of nerves in specimens from non-nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Neuroanatomy of the male pelvis in respect to radical prostatectomy including three-dimensional visualization.', 'A critical analysis of the current knowledge of surgical anatomy related to optimization of cancer control and preservation of continence and erection in candidates for radical prostatectomy.', 'The progress of dorsal vascular complex control strategy in radical prostatectomy.']"""

However, the function of TRPM7 in metastasis of PCa remains largely unknown. Microarray analysis suggested that calcium signaling pathway was significantly altered in metastatic PCa tissues, compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues. Bioinformatics analysis using microarray data and database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery database revealed altered genes involved in calcium signaling pathway were significantly upregulated in TRPM7 deficiency PCa cells, which was also confirmed by experimental verification. Therefore, we aim to investigate the role of TRPM7 in human PCa cell migration and invasion as well as the underlying mechanisms. We observed that TRPM7 was upregulated in PCa cells and tissues compared with prostate hyperplasia cells and tissues. Further investigations suggested that TRPM7 deficiency suppressed migration and invasion of distinct PCa cell lines while overexpression of TRPM7 increased migration of PCa cells. In addition, knockdown of TRPM7 in PCa cells reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) status, accompanied by downregulation of MMPs and upregulation of E-cadherin. Taken together, our study indicated that downregulation of TRPM7 could inhibit migration and invasion via reversing EMT status in PCa cells.""","""['Liang Chen', 'Rui Cao', 'Gang Wang', 'Lushun Yuan', 'Guofeng Qian', 'Zhongqiang Guo', 'Chin-Lee Wu', 'Xinghuan Wang', 'Yu Xiao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Oncol""","""['Correction to: Downregulation of TRPM7 suppressed migration and invasion by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells.', 'TGFβ-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells is mediated via TRPM7 expression.', 'TRPM7 deficiency suppresses cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in human colorectal cancer via regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Suppression of TRPM7 Inhibited Hypoxia-Induced Migration and Invasion of Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells by Enhancing RACK1-Mediated Degradation of HIF-1α.', 'Role of TRPM7 kinase in cancer.', 'TRPM7 and its role in neurodegenerative diseases.', 'STEAP1 Knockdown Decreases the Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells to Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Cabazitaxel.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'On the modulation of TRPM channels: Current perspectives and anticancer therapeutic implications.', 'Clinical and Prognostic Values of TRPM7 in Colon and Rectal Cancers.', 'The interplay between physical cues and mechanosensitive ion channels in cancer metastasis.']"""

Radiation oncologists were more likely to recommend ART >50% for adverse pathological findings post-radical prostatectomy compared to urologists (76 vs. 51%, p = 0.011). Urologists were more likely to monitor their patient's PSA level post-prostatectomy compared to radiation oncologists (93 vs. 77%, p = 0.016). Post-thematic analysis of open-ended questions revealed that urologists rarely refer patients to radiation oncologists for ART, with radiation oncologists confirming that they rarely receive referrals. This study demonstrates the low compliance to ASTRO/AUA guidelines. While radiation oncologists were more aware and compliant to guidelines, urologists were significantly more likely to monitor their patient's PSA. This study highlighted the need for better communication between urologists and radiation oncologists, especially in referrals for ART, to facilitate treatment delivery that is concordant with ASTRO/AUA guidelines.""","""['Bonnie Bristow', 'Mohammed Aldehaim', 'Katija Bonin', 'Candice Chee Ka Lam', 'Stephanie J Wan', 'Xingshan Cao', 'Ewa Szumacher']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Discord Among Radiation Oncologists and Urologists in the Postoperative Management of High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Does Specialty Bias Trump Evidence in the Management of High-risk Prostate Cancer?', 'Concern for overtreatment using the AUA/ASTRO guideline on adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'The role of androgen ablation in patients with biochemical or local failure after definitive radiation therapy: a survey of practice patterns of urologists and radiation oncologists in the United States.', 'Adjuvant versus salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy: do the AUA/ASTRO guidelines have all the answers?', ""Clinicians' attitudes and perceived barriers and facilitators to cancer treatment clinical practice guideline adherence: a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative literature.""]"""

Many studies have shown that down-regulated level of miR-30a is in a variety of cancers including prostate cancer (PCa). However, the precise mechanisms of miR-30a in PCa have not been well explored. In this study, we investigated the biological functions and molecular mechanism of miR-30a in PCa cell lines, discussing whether it could be a therapeutic biomarker of PCa in the future. We found that miR-30a is down-regulated in PCa tissues and cell lines. Moreover, the low level of miR-30a was associated with increased expression of SIX1 in PCa tissues and cell lines. Up-regulation of miR-30a significantly inhibited proliferation of PCa cells. In addition, invasion of PCa cells was suppressed by overexpression of miR-30a. However, down-regulation of miR-30a promoted cell growth and invasion of PCa cells. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the SIX1 was a potential target gene of miR-30a. Next, luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-30a could directly target SIX1. Consistent with the effect of miR-30a, down-regulation of SIX1 by siRNA inhibited proliferation and invasion of PCa cells. Overexpression of SIX1 in PCa cells partially reversed the effect of miR-30a mimic. In conclusion, introduction of miR-30a dramatically inhibited proliferation and invasion of PCa cells by down-regulating SIX1 expression, and that down-regulation of SIX1 was essential for inhibition of cell growth and invasion of PCa cells by overexpression of miR-30a.""","""['Qinghuan Zhu', 'Hongzhi Li', 'Yingjie Li', 'Lining Jiang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Hum Cell""","""['MicroRNA-362 is downregulated in cervical cancer and inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion by directly targeting SIX1.', 'Down-regulation of miR-605 promotes the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells by up-regulating EN2.', 'MicroRNA-539 functions as a tumour suppressor in prostate cancer via the TGF-β/Smad4 signalling pathway by down-regulating DLX1.', 'The Versatile Role of microRNA-30a in Human Cancer.', 'SIX1 transcription factor: A review of cellular functions and regulatory dynamics.', 'Hsa-miR-30a-3p overcomes the acquired protective autophagy of bladder cancer in chemotherapy and suppresses tumor growth and muscle invasion.', 'MiR-30a and miR-200c differentiate cholangiocarcinomas from gastrointestinal cancer liver metastases.', 'miRNAs as Therapeutic Tools and Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'MicroRNAs as Guardians of the Prostate: Those Who Stand before Cancer.

In Malaysia, its ripened crimson sour fruit rind is used as a seasoning agent in curries and culinary dishes. Its roots and leaves decoction is used against skin infections and after child birth. This study aimed to evaluate in vivo hepatoprotective and in vitro cytotoxic activities of 20% methanolic ethyl acetate (MEA) G. hombroniana bark extract.  Materials and methods:   In hepatoprotective activity, liver damage was induced by treating rats with 1.0 mL carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)/kg and MEA extract was administered at a dose of 50, 250 and 500 mg/kg 24 h before intoxication with CCl4. Cytotoxicity study was performed on MCF-7 (human breast cancer), DBTRG (human glioblastoma), PC-3 (human prostate cancer) and U2OS (human osteosarcoma) cell lines. 1H, 13C-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), and IR (infrared) spectral analyses were also conducted for MEA extract.  Results:   In hepatoprotective activity evaluation, MEA extract at a higher dose level of 500 mg/kg showed significant (p<0.05) potency.

We retrospectively evaluated the effect of locoregional treatment (LRT) on overall survival (OS) hypothesizing that this could improve outcome through better local disease control and the induction of an antitumor immune response (abscopal effect).  Patients and methods:   M1 at diagnosis PCa patients referred to the Prostate Targeted Therapy Group at the Royal Marsden between June 2003 and December 2013 were identified. LRT was defined as either surgery, radiotherapy (RT) or transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) administered to the primary tumor at any time point from diagnosis to death. Kaplan-Meier analyses generated OS data. The association between LRT and OS was evaluated in univariate (UV) and multivariate (MV) Cox regression models.  Results:   Overall 300 patients were identified; 192 patients (64%) experienced local symptoms at some point during their disease course; 72 patients received LRT (56.9% TURP, 52.7% RT). None of the patients were treated with prostatectomy. LRT was more frequently performed in patients with low volume disease (35.4% vs. 16.2%; P < .001), lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at diagnosis (median PSA: 75 vs. 184 ng/mL; P = .005) and local symptoms (34.2% vs. 4.8%; P < .001). LRT was associated in UV and MV analysis with longer OS (62.1 vs. 55.8 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; P = .044), which remained significant for RT (69.4 vs. 55.1 months; HR, 0.54; P = .002) but not for TURP.

AR has therefore become an even more attractive therapeutic target in aggressive and disseminated prostate cancer. To investigate mechanisms of AR and AR target gene activation in different subpopulations of prostate cancer cells, a toolkit of AR expressor and androgen response element (ARE) reporter vectors were developed. Three ARE reporter vectors were constructed with different ARE consensus sequences in promoters linked to either fluorescence or luciferase reporter genes in lentiviral vector backbones. Cell lines transduced with the different vectors expressed the reporters in an androgen-dependent way according to fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry and multi-well fluorescent and luminescence assays. Interestingly, the background reporter activity in androgen-depleted medium was significantly higher in LNCaP cells compared to the prostate transit amplifying epithelial cell lines, EP156T-AR and 957E/hTERT-AR with exogenous AR. The androgen-induced signal to background was much higher in the latter benign prostate cells than in LNCaP cells. Androgen-independent nuclear localization of AR was seen in LNCaP cells and reduced ARE-signaling was seen following treatment with abiraterone, an androgen synthesis inhibitor. The ARE reporter activity was significantly stronger when stimulated by androgens than by β-estradiol, progesterone and dexamethasone in all tested cell types. Finally, no androgen-induced ARE reporter activity was observed in tumorigenic mesenchymal progeny cells of EP156T cells following epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

In PI-RADSv1, 5-point ECE risk scoring was used. In PI-RADSv2, ECE criteria included morphologic features and a tumor-capsule contact length (CL) greater than 10 mm. The diagnostic performance of each PI-RADS version and the cutoff CL were evaluated.  Results:   ECE was found in 56 patients (26.7%). In PI-RADSv1, maximal accuracy was achieved with a risk score of 3 or greater. At this threshold, positive findings on PI-RADSv1 and PI-RADSv2 were identified in 21.0-34.3% and 49.0-51.4% of patients, respectively. Compared with PI-RADSv1, PI-RADSv2 had higher negative predictive values (84.9-89.1% vs 96.3-97.1%, respectively; p = 0.003 and 0.021, for each reader).

The aim of this study was to compare the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics (ERG overexpression and PTEN loss) of AIP and IDC-P in core needle biopsies.  Methods and results:   One hundred and six [84 (5.6%) of 1480 consecutive and 22 retrospectively collected] cases met the criteria: AIP only (2.4%), IDC-P only (1.3%), and IDC-P coexisting with AIP (2%). Invasive adenocarcinoma [prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa)] was present in 96% and 97% cases of AIP and IDC-P, respectively. The mean number of glands/focus and the largest gland diameter for AIP and IDC-P were 7.6 (range, 2-27) and 11.7 (range, 1-51), and 0.59 mm (range, 0.2-1.1 mm) and 0.75 mm (range, 0.2-1.8 mm), respectively. For AIP, loose cribriform architecture was the most common (93%) morphology. IDC-P-associated PCa had more aggressive pathology, including the highest combined Gleason score (GS), high-grade GS ≥ 4 + 3, and largest percentage involvement of core by PCa and percentage positive cores, than AIP-associated PCa (P < 0.05). Within the AIP group, ERG status and PTEN status were similar to those of adjacent PCa in 97% and 88% of cases, respectively. Within the IDC-P group, ERG status and PTEN status were similar among IDC-P, AIP and PCa in 96% and 91% of cases, respectively. PTEN loss was frequently heterogeneous in PCa, and localized adjacent to AIP or IDC-P.  Conclusions:   AIP represents a lower-grade morphological spectrum of IDC-P, associated with intermediate-risk PCa.

Co-culture with prostate CAFs or CAF-conditioned medium attenuated DNA damage and the p53 response to chemotherapeutic drugs and enhanced prostate cancer cell survival. CAF-conditioned medium inhibited the accumulation of doxorubicin, but not taxol, in prostate cancer cells in a manner that was associated with increased cancer cell glutathione levels. A low molecular weight fraction (<3 kDa) of CAF-conditioned medium had the same effect. CAF-conditioned medium also inhibited induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both doxorubicin- and taxol-treated cancer cells.

The drug resistance mechanisms activated in CSCs have not been thoroughly investigated. Although neuropeptides such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) can promote tumor growth and activate antiapoptotic signaling in differentiated cancer cells, it is not known whether they can activate antiapoptotic mechanisms in CSCs. The objectives of this study are to unravel the cytoprotective effects of neuropeptides and identify antiapoptotic mechanisms activated by neuropeptides in response to anticancer drug treatment in CSCs. We enriched and purified CSCs (CD44+/high/CD24-/low or CD133+ population) from breast and prostate cancer cell lines, and demonstrated their stemness phenotype. Of the several neuropeptides tested, only VIP could protect CSCs from drug-induced apoptosis. A functional correlation was found between drug-induced apoptosis and dephosphorylation of proapoptotic Bcl2 family protein BAD. Similarly, VIP-induced cytoprotection correlated with BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 in CSCs. Using pharmacological inhibitors and dominant-negative proteins, we showed that VIP-induced cytoprotection and BAD phosphorylation are mediated via both Ras/MAPK and PKA pathways in CSCs of prostate cancer LNCaP and C4-2 cells, but only PKA signaling was involved in CSCs of DUVIPR (DU145 prostate cancer cells ectopically expressing VIP receptor) and breast cancer MCF7 cells. As each of these pathways partially control BAD phosphorylation at Ser112, both have to be inhibited to block the cytoprotective effects of VIP. Furthermore, VIP is unable to protect CSCs that express phosphorylation-deficient mutant-BAD, suggesting that BAD phosphorylation is essential. Thus, antiapoptotic signaling by VIP could be one of the drug resistance mechanisms by which CSCs escape from anticancer therapies. Our findings suggest the potential usefulness of VIP receptor inhibition to eliminate CSCs, and that targeting BAD might be an attractive strategy for development of novel therapeutics.""","""['Konduru S Sastry', 'Aouatef Ismail Chouchane', 'Ena Wang', 'George Kulik', 'Francesco M Marincola', 'Lotfi Chouchane']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Diverse antiapoptotic signaling pathways activated by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, epidermal growth factor, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in prostate cancer cells converge on BAD.', 'Midkine downregulation increases the efficacy of quercetin on prostate cancer stem cell survival and migration through PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathway.', 'Vasoactive intestinal peptide induces neuroendocrine differentiation in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line through PKA, ERK, and PI3K.', 'Breast cancer stem cells: A\xa0review of their characteristics and the agents that affect them.', 'Vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors: a molecular target in breast and lung cancer.', 'Gene Expression Analysis Links Autocrine Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide and ZEB1 in Gastrointestinal Cancers.', 'Dual role of PID1 in regulating apoptosis induced by distinct anticancer-agents through AKT/Raf-1-dependent pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Inhibition of signaling downstream of beta-2 adrenoceptor by propranolol in prostate cancer cells.', 'Activation of VIPR1 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma progression by regulating arginine and pyrimidine metabolism.', 'Prognostic and Functional Analysis of NPY6R in Uveal Melanoma Using Bioinformatics.']"""

Significant activity of the n-hexane and the dichloromethane extracts was observed against the breast cancer cell line MCF7 with IC50 s of 45.6 and 54.7 μg/mL, respectively. Moreover, the 70% ethyl acetate in n-hexane chromatographic fraction showed significant activity displaying IC50 values of 53.0, 52.4 and 49.1 μg/mL against the cancer cell lines A549, MCF7 and PC3, respectively.

Cabazitaxel, docetaxel, and paclitaxel bind specifically to tubulin in microtubules, disrupting functions essential to tumor growth. High levels of βIII-tubulin isotype expression are associated with tumor aggressivity and drug resistance. To understand cabazitaxel's increased efficacy, we examined binding of radio-labeled cabazitaxel and docetaxel to microtubules and the drugs' suppression of microtubule dynamic instability in vitro in microtubules assembled from purified bovine brain tubulin containing or devoid of βIII-tubulin. We found that cabazitaxel suppresses microtubule dynamic instability significantly more potently in the presence of βIII-tubulin than in its absence. In contrast, docetaxel showed no βIII-tubulin-enhanced microtubule stabilization. We also asked if the selective potency of cabazitaxel on βIII-tubulin-containing purified microtubules in vitro extends to cabazitaxel's effects in human tumor cells. Using MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, we found that cabazitaxel also suppressed microtubule shortening rates, shortening lengths, and dynamicity significantly more strongly in cells with normal levels of βIII-tubulin than after 50% reduction of βIII-tubulin expression by siRNA knockdown. Cabazitaxel also more strongly induced mitotic arrest in MCF7 cells with normal βIII-tubulin levels than after βIII-tubulin reduction. In contrast, docetaxel had little or no βIII-tubulin-dependent selective effect on microtubule dynamics or mitotic arrest.

The aim of this study was to explore variation in screening mammography rates at the level of MA managed care plans.  Methods:   Using the 2016 MA Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set Public Use File, screening mammography rates were identified for all 385 reporting MA plans. Associations were explored with a range of plan characteristics from this file, as well as from the CMS Part C and Part D Medicare Star Ratings Data File, Medicare Advantage Plan Directory, and Medicare Monthly Enrollment by Plan File.  Results:   Overall MA plan screening rates were high (mean, 72.6 ± 9.4%) but varied substantially among plans (range, 14.3%-91.8%). Screening rates were higher in nonprofit versus for-profit plans (77.3% versus 71.8%, P < .001), as well as in health maintenance organization or local preferred provider organization plans versus private fee-for-service or regional preferred provider organization plans (71.9%-73.2% versus 65.5%-66.8%, P = .001). Among parent organizations with five or more plans, screening rates were highest for Kaiser Foundation (median, 88.4%) and lowest for Molina Healthcare (median, 65.3%). Screening rates showed small but significant associations with plans' contract lengths, enrolled populations, and counties served. Screening rates showed strong associations (r = 0.796-0.798) with colorectal cancer screening and annual flu vaccine rates and showed moderate associations (r = 0.283-0.365) with ambulatory and preventive care visits, osteoporosis screenings, body mass index assessments, and nonrecommended prostate-specific antigen screenings after age 70.  Conclusions:   Screening mammography rates vary considerably among MA plans.

A cell viability assay was applied to investigate the effect of various concentrations of celecoxib (0, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 µmol/l) on PC3 cells for 24 and 48 h, respectively. The 50% inhibitory concentration of celecoxib for 24 h was chosen for subsequent experiments. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining flow cytometry, as well as caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase proteins detected by western blotting, were applied to analyze cellular apoptosis induced by celecoxib. Ultrastructural cellular changes observed by transmission electron microscopy and the level of LC-3 II and P62 detected by western blotting were used to determine the activation of autophagy. It was demonstrated that celecoxib induced apoptosis and activated autophagy in PC3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, flow cytometry and western blotting were applied to elucidate whether the role of autophagy in celecoxib-induced apoptosis is protective or destructive. Blockade of autophagy markedly increased apoptosis, suggesting that celecoxib-activated autophagy was cytoprotective. Additionally, c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) was demonstrated to have a role in autophagic activation, and suppression of JNK was able to reduce autophagy and increase apoptosis. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that celecoxib induces apoptosis in PC3 cells; however, celecoxib also activates JNK-mediated autophagy, which exerts cytoprotective effects in prostate cancer PC3 cells.

Deciding whether to administer salvage therapy (ST) at PSA-R presents challenges, as treatment reduces the risk of progression to clinical metastasis but incurs unnecessary side effects should the man die before metastasis. We have developed a new harm-benefit framework using a clinical cohort to inform shared decision making between patients and physicians at PSA-R.  Methods:   Records of 1,045 Johns Hopkins University Hospital patients diagnosed between 1984 and 2013 who had PSA-R following radical prostatectomy were analyzed using marginal structural models to estimate the baseline risk of metastasis and the effect of ST (radiation therapy with or without hormone therapy) while accounting for selection into ST on the basis of PSA growth. The estimated model predicts the harm-benefit tradeoffs of ST within patient subgroups. The benefit of ST is the absolute reduction in the risk of metastasis within 10 years; the harm is the frequency of cancers that would not have metastasized in the patient's lifetime in the absence of ST (overtreatment).  Results:   The adjusted hazard ratio associated with ST was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.55). Providing ST to all men at PSA-R reduced the risk of metastasis from 43% to 23% but led to 31% of men being overtreated (harm/benefit = 31/(43-23) = 1.6). Providing ST to men with Gleason score >7 reduced the risk of metastasis from 67% to 39%, with 13% of men being overtreated (harm/benefit = 13/(67-39) = 0.5).  Conclusions:   A quantitative framework that evaluates primary harms and benefits of ST after PSA-R will facilitate informed decision making.

GHRH, a 44-residue neuropeptide produced in the hypothalamus, regulates the secretion of growth hormone through its binding to GHRHR. It has recently been associated with several types of cancer such as prostate, breast, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Family B GPCR peptides bind in a two-step model, where first the C-terminal region of the peptide interacts with the extracellular domain (ECD) of the receptor and subsequently, the N-terminal interacts with the seven transmembrane domain (TMD), resulting in activation. Structural information on family B GPCRs is limited; therefore, the use of computational methods may assist their efficient targeting towards new therapeutics. Here, we have utilized several computational tools, such as homology modelling, docking, large-scale molecular dynamics and principal component analysis (PCA), in order to: (a) gain information on the dynamic properties of the receptor domains and (b) propose a structural model for the interactions between GHRH and the ECD and TMD regions of GHRHR respectively.

Here, we showed that in LNCaP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells transiently overexpressing androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was activated and could result in up-regulated interleukin (IL)-6 gene expression, indicating a positive interaction between AR-V7 expression and activated NF-κB/IL-6 signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) pathogenesis. Importantly, both AR-V7-induced NF-κB activation and IL-6 gene transcription in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells could be inhibited by melatonin. Furthermore, stimulation of AR-V7 mRNA expression in LNCaP cells by betulinic acid, a pharmacological NF-κB activator, was reduced by melatonin treatment. Our data support the presence of bi-directional positive interactions between AR-V7 expression and NF-κB activation in CRPC pathogenesis. Of note, melatonin, by inhibiting NF-κB activation via the previously-reported MT₁ receptor-mediated antiproliferative pathway, can disrupt these bi-directional positive interactions between AR-V7 and NF-κB and thereby delay the development of castration resistance in advanced prostate cancer. Apparently, this therapeutic potential of melatonin in advanced prostate cancer/CRPC management is worth translation in the clinic via combined androgen depletion and melatonin repletion.""","""['Vincent Wing Sun Liu', 'Wing Lung Yau', 'Chun Wai Tam', 'Kwok-Ming Yao', 'Stephen Yuen Wing Shiu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['NF-κB Blockade with Oral Administration of Dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT), Delays Prostate Cancer Resistance to Androgen Receptor (AR) Inhibition and Inhibits AR Variants.', 'Analytical Validation and Clinical Qualification of a New Immunohistochemical Assay for Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 Protein Expression in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'CX4945 suppresses the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by reducing AR-V7 expression.', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splicing variant 7: Beyond being a constitutively active variant.', 'Melatonin and Prostate Cancer: Anti-tumor Roles and Therapeutic Application.', 'LOX-1 Activation by oxLDL Induces AR and AR-V7 Expression via NF-κB and STAT3 Signaling Pathways Reducing Enzalutamide Cytotoxic Effects.', 'Therapeutic Effect of Melatonin in Premature Ovarian Insufficiency: Hippo Pathway Is Involved.', 'Resistance to second generation antiandrogens in prostate cancer: pathways and mechanisms.', 'Molecular mechanism of inhibitory effects of melatonin on prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion.']"""

The different side effect profiles of these options are crucial factors for patients and clinicians when deciding between treatments. This study reports long-term health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for patients in their second decade after treatment for prostate cancer. We used a validated survey to assess urinary, bowel, and sexual function and HRQOL in a prospective cohort of patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer 14-18 years previously. We report and compare the outcomes of patients who were initially treated with RP, EBRT, or BT. Of 230 eligible patients, the response rate was 92% (n = 211) and median follow-up was 14.6 years. Compared to baseline, RP patients had significantly worse urinary incontinence and sexual function, EBRT patients had worse scores in all domains, and BT patients had worse urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, and sexual function. When comparing treatment groups, RP patients underwent larger declines in urinary continence than did BT patients, and EBRT and BT patients experienced larger changes in urinary irritation/obstruction. Baseline functional status was significantly associated with long-term function for urinary obstruction and bowel function domains. This is one of the few prospective reports on quality of life for prostate cancer patients beyond 10 years, and adds information about the late consequences of treatment choices.

Methods:   The case cohort comprised 150 men with a baseline prostate-specific antigen level <2.0 ng/mL, and who developed prostate cancer within 10 years. The control cohort was 300 baseline prostate-specific antigen- and age-adjusted men who did not develop prostate cancer. Serum prostate-specific antigen, free prostate-specific antigen, and [-2] proenzyme prostate-specific antigen were measured at baseline and last screening visit. The predictive impact of baseline prostate-specific antigen- and [-2] proenzyme prostate-specific antigen-related indices on developing prostate cancer was investigated. The predictive impact of those indices at last screening visit and velocities from baseline to final screening on tumor aggressiveness were also investigated.  Results:   The baseline free to total prostate-specific antigen ratio was a significant predictor of prostate cancer development. The odds ratio was 6.08 in the lowest quintile baseline free to total prostate-specific antigen ratio subgroup. No serum indices at diagnosis were associated with tumor aggressiveness.

Recent research suggests that ANGPTL4 is induced by hypoxia and is a useful diagnostic or prognostic marker for various cancers. However, it remains unclear whether ANGPTL4 expression influences prostate cancer. Here we examined the biological and clinical relevance of ANGPTL4 expression in prostate cancer. Firstly we examined ANGPTL4 expression in the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and LNCaP/CH incubated at 1% O2 for at least 6 months. We compared cellular proliferation, migration, and ANGPTL4 secretion in a culture medium between these cell lines. In addition, we investigated the effect of various concentrations of recombinant ANGPTL4 protein (rANGPTL4) on cellular proliferation and intracellular signaling pathways. Moreover, we used ANGPTL4 knockdown by RNA interference to investigate the influence of ANGPTL4 expression on these cell lines. Finally, we investigated the correlation between ANGPTL4 expression in prostate cancer specimens and clinicopathological parameters using immunohistochemistry. Our data suggested that the expression of ANGPTL4 in hypoxic conditions was 14.4-fold higher than that in normoxic condition. ANGPTL4 secretion in the culture medium increased 7.0-fold. In addition, rANGPTL4 increased cellular proliferation 1.72-fold via Akt activation. Moreover, ANGPTL4 knockdown decreased cell growth and its secretion by 25.7 and 41.4%, respectively, compared with the control. A multivariate analysis showed that positive ANGPTL4 expression in the resected specimens was an independent prognostic indicator of biochemical recurrence (P=0.03, hazard ratio = 2.02). Our results show that ANGPTL4 is induced by hypoxia and promotes cancer progression via the activated PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, ANGPTL4 can be used as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.""","""['Shinro Hata', 'Takeo Nomura', 'Kazunori Iwasaki', 'Ryuta Sato', 'Mutsushi Yamasaki', 'Fuminori Sato', 'Hiromitsu Mimata']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Hypoxia-induced ANGPTL4 sustains tumour growth and anoikis resistance through different mechanisms in scirrhous gastric cancer cell lines.', 'ANGPTL4 Correlates with NSCLC Progression and Regulates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition via ERK Pathway.', 'Angiopoietin-like 4 promotes osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration and stimulates osteoclastogenesis.', 'Angiopoietin-like protein 4: A therapeutic target for triglycerides and coronary disease?', 'Angiogenesis, p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 in the progression of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Role of primary aging hallmarks in Alzheimer´s disease.', 'Integrative Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Analyses of Hypoxia-Treated Pulmonary Artery Smooth Muscle Cells.', 'Angiopoietin-Like Protein 4 and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 Expression in Invasive Breast Carcinoma in Young Women.', 'ANGPTL4 regulate glutamine metabolism and fatty acid oxidation in nonsmall cell lung cancer cells.', 'Identification of the prognostic value of elevated ANGPTL4 expression in gallbladder cancer-associated fibroblasts.']"""

In spite of numerous studies to understand the effects of genistein on prostate cancer, the mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the differences in methylation and gene expression levels of prostate specimens from a clinical trial of genistein supplementation prior to prostatectomy using Illumina HumanMethylation450 and Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip Microarrays. The present study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial on Norwegian patients who received 30 mg genistein or placebo capsules daily for 3-6 weeks before prostatectomy. Gene expression changes were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Whole genome methylation and expression profiling identified differentially methylated sites and expressed genes between placebo and genistein groups. Differentially regulated genes were involved in developmental processes, stem cell markers, proliferation and transcriptional regulation.

Intriguingly, the impact of physical activity (PA) on intramuscular tumors (e.g. sarcomas) has not been specifically addressed and, thus, could be mistakenly confounded with other cancers. In this preclinical study we assessed the impact of PA on intramuscular liposarcoma (LS) evolution. Four-week-old nude male mice were active by voluntary running on wheels, for six weeks. Then, mice were divided into four groups with open or restricted access to wheels, which have received an orthotopic intramuscular injection of either vehicle or human LS, SW872, cells. Active mice presented ~1.5 fold increase in tumor mass, which was mainly due to higher cellular mitosis and proliferation. This bulging intramuscular tumor mass altered muscle function, as evidence by overall muscle strength and maximum running capacity. From a molecular point of view, active mice exhibited poor levels of Phospho-p38Thr180/Tyr182 and p21 content in tumors and also displayed low amounts of circulating insulin comparing to inactive counterparts. Insulin induced Phospho-p38Thr180/Tyr182 and p21 expression in SW872 cells, in vitro. The expression of p21 was regulated in a p38-dependent fashion, since inhibition of p38 activity abolished the up-regulation of p21. Our data suggest that insulin-dependent activation of p38 MAPK-p21 pathway is a possible mechanism responsible for delaying tumor growth in inactive mice. Clinically, patients with lower-extremities LS could be advised to reduce or minimize their levels of PA during the preoperative period.""","""['Mohamad Assi', 'Frédéric Derbré', 'Luz Lefeuvre-Orfila', 'Dany Saligaut', 'Nathalie Stock', 'Mickael Ropars', 'Amélie Rébillard']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Am J Cancer Res""","""['Interleukin-6, C/EBP-β and PPAR-γ expression correlates with intramuscular liposarcoma growth in mice: The impact of voluntary physical activity levels.', 'The role of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades in inhibition of proliferation in human prostate carcinoma cells by raloxifene: an in vitro experiment.', 'Caffeic acid phenethyl ester induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via regulation of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.', 'Down-regulation of long non-coding RNA MALAT1 inhibits granulosa cell proliferation in endometriosis by up-regulating P21 via activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway.', 'Estrogen suppresses breast cancer proliferation through GPER / p38 MAPK axis during hypoxia.', 'N-Acetylcysteine Reduces the Pro-Oxidant and Inflammatory Responses during Pancreatitis and Pancreas Tumorigenesis.', 'Exercise shapes redox signaling in cancer.', 'Impacts of exercise interventions on different diseases and organ functions in mice.', 'Animal models of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma: utility and limitations.', 'The Practice of Physical Activity in the Setting of Lower-Extremities Sarcomas: A First Step toward Clinical Optimization.']"""

A randomised, controlled study protocol examining feasibility, safety and efficacy""","""Introduction:   Exercise may positively alter tumour biology through numerous modulatory and regulatory mechanisms in response to a variety of modes and dosages, evidenced in preclinical models to date. Specifically, localised and systemic biochemical alterations produced during and following exercise may suppress tumour formation, growth and distribution by virtue of altered epigenetics and endocrine-paracrine activity. Given the impressive ability of targeted mechanical loading to interfere with metastasis-driven tumour formation in human osteolytic tumour cells, it is of equal interest to determine whether a similar effect is observed in sclerotic tumour cells. The study aims to (1) establish the feasibility and safety of a combined modular multimodal exercise programme with spinal isometric training in advanced prostate cancer patients with sclerotic bone metastases and (2) examine whether targeted and supervised exercise can suppress sclerotic tumour growth and activity in spinal metastases in humans.  Methods and analysis:   A single-blinded, two-armed, randomised, controlled and explorative phase I clinical trial combining spinal isometric training with a modular multimodal exercise programme in 40 men with advanced prostate cancer and stable sclerotic spinal metastases. Participants will be randomly assigned to (1) the exercise intervention or (2) usual medical care. The intervention arm will receive a 3-month, supervised and individually tailored modular multimodal exercise programme with spinal isometric training. Primary endpoints (feasibility and safety) and secondary endpoints (tumour morphology; biomarker activity; anthropometry; musculoskeletal health; adiposity; physical function; quality of life; anxiety; distress; fatigue; insomnia; physical activity levels) will be measured at baseline and following the intervention. Statistical analyses will include descriptive characteristics, t-tests, effect sizes and two-way (group × time) repeated-measures analysis of variance (or analysis of covariance) to examine differences between groups over time. The data-set will be primarily examined using an intention-to-treat approach with multiple imputations, followed by a secondary sensitivity analysis to ensure data robustness using a complete cases approach.  Ethics and dissemination:   Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of Edith Cowan University and the Sir Charles Gairdner and Osborne Park Health Care Group. If proven to be feasible and safe, this study will form the basis of future phase II and III trials in human patients with advanced cancer.

BMP4 overexpression in non-osteogenic C4-2b PCa cells led to ectopic bone formation under subcutaneous implantation. Tumor-induced bone was reduced in trigenic mice (Tie2cre/Osxf/f/SCID) with endothelial-specific deletion of osteoblast cell-fate determinant OSX compared with bigenic mice (Osxf/f/SCID). Thus, tumor-induced EC-to-OSB conversion is one mechanism that leads to osteoblastic bone metastasis of PCa.""","""['Song-Chang Lin', 'Yu-Chen Lee', 'Guoyu Yu', 'Chien-Jui Cheng', 'Xin Zhou', 'Khoi Chu', 'Monzur Murshed', 'Nhat-Tu Le', 'Laura Baseler', 'Jun-Ichi Abe', 'Keigi Fujiwara', 'Benoit deCrombrugghe', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Gary E Gallick', 'Li-Yuan Yu-Lee', 'Sankar N Maity', 'Sue-Hwa Lin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Dev Cell""","""['The Bony Side of Endothelial Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'Osteoblastic Factors in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Prostate cancer cells induce osteoblast differentiation through a Cbfa1-dependent pathway.', 'BMP4 promotes prostate tumor growth in bone through osteogenesis.', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor contributes to prostate cancer-mediated osteoblastic activity.', 'Mechanism of osteoblastic bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Antagonizing exosomal miR-18a-5p derived from prostate cancer cells ameliorates metastasis-induced osteoblastic lesions by targeting Hist1h2bc and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'The epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity landscape: principles of design and mechanisms of regulation.', 'Pathological angiogenesis: mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.', 'Endothelial-to-osteoblast transition in normal mouse bone development.', 'Alendronate conjugate for targeted delivery to bone-forming prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Between January 2012 and March 2016, 439 prostate cancer (PCa) patients with normal preoperative continence were retrospectively included. FP score was defined as the extent of FP from base to apex of the prostate, quantitatively assessed by the surgeon. Anatomical prostate structures were measured on endorectal preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) was used to assess urinary incontinence (UI). Cox analysis was used to determine predictive factors for early continence recovery. Finally a binary logistic regression analysis was performed to develop a risk calculator.  Results:   At a median follow up of 12.1 months 50.8% of men reported UI. In the Cox multivariate analysis longer membranous urethral length (MUL; P < 0.0001; OR 1.309; CI 1.211, 1.415) and shorter inner levator distance (ILD; P < 0.0001; OR 0.904; CI 0.85, 0.961) were predictors of earlier continence recovery. In the multivariate binary logistic regression analysis longer MUL (P < 0.0001; OR 1.565, CI 1.362, 1.798), shorter ILD (P < 0.0001; OR 0.819, CI 0.742, 0.904) and higher FP score (P = 0.024; OR 1.089, CI 1.011, 1.172) were independent predictors of continence outcome. The risk calculator predicted continence recovery between 1.3% and 99%.

The Scandinavian Thrombosis and Cancer Cohort provides person-time data and validated VTEs. Impact of cancer stage on VTE incidence tended to vary with cancer type. Cancer stage may not per se be a risk factor for VTE in all cancer types.  Summary:   Background Absolute measures of the impact of cancer stage on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with distinct cancer types have not been investigated in a large population-based cohort study. Objectives To investigate differences in the incidence rates of objectively confirmed VTE according to the development of cancer in a large population-based cohort study. Cancer type and stage at the time of diagnosis were taken into account. Patients and Methods The Scandinavian Thrombosis and Cancer Cohort includes data regarding cancer types, stages and objectively confirmed VTE diagnoses among 144 952 participants followed from 1993 to 2012. We studied stage-specific incidence rates of VTE, and calculated incidence rate differences (IRDs) for VTE according to stages in patients with 10 types of solid cancer. Results During the entire follow-up, 335 VTEs occurred, of which 293 occurred within 5 years. The IRD of VTE in patients with distant metastasis as compared with those with localized disease indicated large variation depending on cancer type. The highest IRD was observed for pancreatic cancer (IRD of 187.0 × 10-3 person-years [p-y]; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 6.7 to 380.8), and the lowest IRD was observed for prostate cancer (IRD of 3.7 × 10-3 p-y; 95% CI - 7 to 15.2). Regional spread as compared with localized disease also indicated large variation depending on cancer type; the highest IRD was observed for uterine cancer (IRD of 37.6 × 10-3 p-y; 95% CI - 23.7 to 99), and the IRDs for breast and prostate cancer were close to zero.

Methods:   Retrospective analyses of 6132 men who were 50-75 years old undergoing 2-year repeat prostate biopsy after a negative baseline biopsy for PCa in the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) study. PA, CPI and PCa were determined by central pathology. The association of baseline PA and CPI with 2-year repeat biopsy cancer status and grade was evaluated with χ2 test and logistic regression controlling clinicopathological features.  Results:   PA, CPI and both were detected in 583 (9.5%), 1063 (17.4%) and 3675 (59.9%) baseline biopsies, respectively.

Methods:   Three pressurized-air drivers were used to excite shear waves within the prostate at vibration frequencies of 60, 70, and 80 Hz. Full 3D wave fields were acquired by multislice spin-echo echo-planar imaging in conjunction with tomoelastography wave speed recovery for generating full field-of-view stiffness maps. Twelve healthy volunteers were repeatedly scanned to analyze test-retest reproducibility. Five patients with suspected prostate cancer were investigated to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of the method.  Results:   In healthy volunteers, the shear wave speed of the entire prostate was 2.24 ± 0.20 m/s with a repeatability coefficient of 0.14 m/s and 88% intraclass correlation coefficient. No significant difference between the peripheral zone (2.27 ± 0.20 m/s) and the central gland (2.22 ± 0.23 m/s) was observed. In patients, wave-speed maps displayed stiff regions consistent with the localization of suspicious masses detected by other imaging markers.  Conclusions:   The proposed method provides reproducible quantitative maps of tissue stiffness throughout the pelvic region and can easily be integrated into clinical imaging protocols.

We reviewed various risk factors that were correlated with perioperative complications, including patient characteristics [age, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities], clinical findings (preoperative PSA level, Gleason score, clinical stage, pathological grade), and surgeon's own clinical practice. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was used to explain comorbidities. The total rate of perioperative complications was 23.2% (98/421). There were 45/421 (10.7%), 28/421 (6.6%), 24/421 (5.7%) and 1/421 (0.2%) in grade I, II, III, IV respectively, and 323/421 (76.8%) cases had none of these complications. Statistical analysis of multiple potential risk factors revealed that BMI >30 (P=0.014), Charlson score ≥1 (P<0.001) and surgical experience (P=0.0252) were predictors of perioperative complications. Age, PSA level, Gleason score, TNM stage, operation time, blood loss, and blood transfusion were not correlated with perioperative complications (P>0.05). It was concluded that patients' own factors and surgeons' technical factors are related with an increased risk of development of perioperative complications following radical prostatectomy.

Methods:   Sixty-three consecutive patients (64±9years) were prospectively included in this non-inferiority trial, powered at 80% to demonstrate a ≤10% difference in signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging (T2WI, DWI) at 1.5T compared to 3T. Secondary endpoints were analysis of subjective IQ and PI-RADS v2 scoring.  Results:   All patients received multi-parametric prostate MRI on a 3T (T2WI, DWI, DCE) and bi-parametric MRI (T2WI, DWI) on a 1.5T scanner using body coils, respectively. SNR and CNR of T2WI were similar at 1.5T and 3T (p=0.7-1), but of DWI significantly lower at 1.5T (p<0.01). Subjective IQ was significantly better at 3T for both, T2WI and DWI (p<0.01). PI-RADS scores were comparable for both field strengths (p=0.05-1). Inter-reader agreement was excellent for subjective IQ assessment and PI-RADS scoring (k=0.9-1).  Conclusion:   Prostate MRI at 1.5T can reveal comparable objective image quality in T2WI, but is inferior to 3T in DWI and subjective IQ.

Minimum tumor-free waiting periods differ according to type of cancer, staging, site of occurrence, response to therapy, and risk of cancer recurrence. We report a case of living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) in a patient after brachytherapy for prostate cancer.  Case report:   The patient was a 65-year-old man with chronic kidney disease due to chronic glomerular nephritis. He received hemodialysis 3 times a week. His prostate-specific antigen level (PSA) was high (6.57 ng/mL), and he was diagnosed with prostate cancer (T1cN0M0, Gleason Score 3 + 4 = 7, 3/10) by needle biopsy in urology. He was treated with maximum androgen blockade (MAB) therapy and brachytherapy in May 2014. He underwent LDKT from a spousal donor at our department in December 2015, because urologists concluded that the prostate cancer was completely cured. Immunosuppression consisted of induction with basiliximab and maintenance with tacrolimus, mizoribine, and steroids. The postoperative course was uneventful. He discharged at postoperative day 29 with a serum creatinine level of 1.30 mg/dL. Three months after LDKT, his PSA level was 0.477 ng/mL, and there was no evidence of prostate cancer recurrence.

The EF domain (EFD) contains six questions and is a sensitive and specific measurement of treatment-related changes in EF. The EFD score has been widely used as a primary assessment end point for clinical trials of EF recovery after radical prostatectomy (RP). Various EFD scores have been used to define functional erections. Recently, an EFD score of at least 22 has been used as a threshold in major post-RP penile rehabilitation studies.  Aim:   To define the EFD score that optimally defines ""functional"" erections after RP.  Methods:   We assessed men 24 months after RP using the IIEF and specifically analyzed the scores of the EFD and intercourse satisfaction domain (ISD).  Main outcome measures:   We used two questions on satisfaction (score = 0-5) and enjoyment (score = 0-5) from the ISD to classify IS (score = 0-10). We tested the following intercourse satisfaction classifications: ISD score equal to 10, ISD score of at least 8, and a score of at least 4 for the ISD questions on satisfaction and enjoyment. We used the classification that produced the largest area under the curve (AUC) using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Then, we used a three-step process to determine the optimal EFD score cutoff using sensitivity and specificity analysis.  Results:   One hundred seventy-eight men had an average age at RP of 58 ± 7 years and a 24-month EFD score of 20 ± 9. Sixty-four percent had complete nerve-sparing surgery, 35% had partial nerve-sparing surgery, and 1% had the nerves fully resected. Thirty-three percent had laparoscopic RP and 67% had open RP. The ROC curves produced AUCs of 0.80 (ISD score = 10), 0.85 (ISD score ≥ 8), and 0.86 (ISD scores for satisfaction and enjoyment ≥ 4; P < .001 for all comparisons). Using the IS criterion of ISD scores for satisfaction and enjoyment of at least 4 (largest AUC), the sensitivity and specificity values were 0.89 and 0.66 for an ESD score equal to 22, 0.78 and 0.71 for a score equal to 23, 0.78 and 0.80 for a score equal to 24, 0.77 and 0.82 for a score equal to 25, and 0.73 and 0.85 for a score equal to 26. The scores of 24 and 25 met the criteria outlined in the first two steps of analysis. The score of 24 was selected as the cutoff using face valid judgment and the previous literature.  Conclusion:   These data support an EFD score of 24 as a valid cutoff defining ""functional"" erection in men with erectile dysfunction after RP. These data are important for clinicians in counseling patients and to researchers to define inclusion criteria and treatment end points for trials of erectile dysfunction after RP.

Here, we develop an in vitro three-dimensional (3D) prostate tumor model based on a hyaluronic acid (HA)-alginate hybrid hydrogel to bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo anticancer drug evaluations. In situ encapsulation of PCa cells was achieved by mixing HA and alginate aqueous solutions in the presence of cells and then crosslinking with calcium ions. Unlike in 2D culture, cells were found to aggregate into spheroids in a 3D matrix. The expression of epithelial to mesenchyme transition (EMT) biomarkers was found to be largely enhanced, indicating an increased invasion and metastasis potential in the hydrogel matrix. A significant up-regulation of proangiogenic growth factors (IL-8, VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was observed in 3D-cultured PCa cells. The results of anti-cancer drug evaluation suggested a higher drug tolerance within the 3D tumor model compared to conventional 2D-cultured cells.

Neopterin, which is secreted by interferon-γ stimulated macrophages, exhibits an association with multiple cancer types and metastatic disease. Chitotriosidase, which is secreted by chronically activated macrophages and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor stimulated neutrophils has not been studied in the setting of cancer.  Objective:   The goal of this discovery study was to screen chitotriosidase for diagnostic capacity in detecting cancer and compare its operating characteristics with those of neopterin.  Methods:   Serum from subjects with breast (n= 66) or prostate (n= 70) cancer, and from 204 subjects free of malignant disease were studied. Chitotriosidase was measured by enzyme activity assay, while neopterin was measured by a competitive enzyme immunoassay. Statistical analyses included group comparisons by Mann Whitney U test, diagnostic capacity by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis and biomarker associations with physiologic and clinical measures by Spearman correlation.  Results:   Chitotriosidase activity was significantly higher in both cancer types compared with gender matched controls, though only in breast cancer was the diagnostic capacity significant (area under the ROC curve of 0.97 ± 0.01). In contrast, neopterin was significantly elevated in prostate cancer and exhibited discriminatory capacity (area under the ROC curve of 0.76 ± 0.05). Age, BMI, % body fat and metastasis were variables that correlated with neopterin, but not chitotriosidase levels.

Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) has been routinely used to guide prostate biopsy. This manuscript proposes a semiautomatic segmentation method for the prostate on three-dimensional (3D) TRUS images.  Methods:   The proposed segmentation method uses a context-classification-based random walk algorithm. Because context information reflects patient-specific characteristics and prostate changes in the adjacent slices, and classification information reflects population-based prior knowledge, we combine the context and classification information at the same time in order to define the applicable population and patient-specific knowledge so as to more accurately determine the seed points for the random walk algorithm. The method is initialized with the user drawing the prostate and non-prostate circles on the mid-gland slice and then automatically segments the prostate on other slices. To achieve reliable classification, we use a new adaptive k-means algorithm to cluster the training data and train multiple decision-tree classifiers. According to the patient-specific characteristics, the most suitable classifier is selected and combined with the context information in order to locate the seed points. By providing accuracy locations of the seed points, the random walk algorithm improves segmentation performance.  Results:   We evaluate the proposed segmentation approach on a set of 3D TRUS volumes of prostate patients. The experimental results show that our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 91.0% ± 1.6% as compared to manual segmentation by clinically experienced radiologist.  Conclusions:   The random walk-based segmentation framework, which combines patient-specific characteristics and population information, is effective for segmenting the prostate on ultrasound images.

We assessed epigenetic regulation of AR target genes in LNCaP PCa cells and showed that DIM treatment led to epigenetic suppression of AR target genes involved in DNA repair (PARP1, MRE11, DNA-PK). Decreased expression of these genes was accompanied by an increase in repressive chromatin marks, loss of AR occupancy and EZH2 recruitment to their regulatory regions. Decreased DNA repair gene expression was associated with an increase in DNA damage (γH2Ax) and up-regulation of genomic repeat elements LINE1 and α-satellite.

This paper presents an automated method based on multimodal convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for two PCa diagnostic tasks: (1) distinguishing between cancerous and noncancerous tissues and (2) distinguishing between clinically significant (CS) and indolent PCa. Specifically, our multimodal CNNs effectively fuse apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and T2-weighted MP-MRI images (T2WIs). To effectively fuse ADCs and T2WIs we design a new similarity loss function to enforce consistent features being extracted from both ADCs and T2WIs. The similarity loss is combined with the conventional classification loss functions and integrated into the back-propagation procedure of CNN training. The similarity loss enables better fusion results than existing methods as the feature learning processes of both modalities are mutually guided, jointly facilitating CNN to 'see' the true visual patterns of PCa. The classification results of multimodal CNNs are further combined with the results based on handcrafted features using a support vector machine classifier. To achieve a satisfactory accuracy for clinical use, we comprehensively investigate three critical factors which could greatly affect the performance of our multimodal CNNs but have not been carefully studied previously. (1) Given limited training data, how can these be augmented in sufficient numbers and variety for fine-tuning deep CNN networks for PCa diagnosis? (2) How can multimodal MP-MRI information be effectively combined in CNNs? (3) What is the impact of different CNN architectures on the accuracy of PCa diagnosis? Experimental results on extensive clinical data from 364 patients with a total of 463 PCa lesions and 450 identified noncancerous image patches demonstrate that our system can achieve a sensitivity of 89.85% and a specificity of 95.83% for distinguishing cancer from noncancerous tissues and a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 76.92% for distinguishing indolent PCa from CS PCa.

By global DNA methylation analysis and RNA-Seq, we provide compelling evidence that conditioned media from CAFs explanted from two unrelated patients with advanced PCa, stimulates concurrent DNA hypo- and hyper-methylation required for EMT and stemness in PC3 and DU145, but not in LN-CaP and its derivative C4-2B, PCa cells. CpG island (CGI) hyper-methylation associates with repression of genes required for epithelial maintenance and invasion antagonism, whereas activation of EMT markers and stemness genes correlate with CGI hypo-methylation. Remarkably, methylation variations and EMT-regulated transcripts almost completely reverse qualitatively and quantitatively during MET. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the PRAD TCGA data set with the differentially expressed (DE) and methylated EMT signature, identified a gene cluster of DE genes defined by a CAF+ and AR- phenotype and worst diagnosis. This gene cluster includes the relevant factors for EMT and stemness, which display DNA methylation variations in regulatory regions inversely correlated to their expression changes, thus strongly sustaining the ex-vivo data. DNMT3A-dependent methylation is essential for silencing epithelial maintenance and EMT counteracting genes, such as CDH1 and GRHL2, that is, the direct repressor of ZEB1, the key transcriptional factor for EMT and stemness. Accordingly, DNMT3A knock-down prevents EMT entry. These results shed light on the mechanisms of establishment and maintenance of coexisting DNA hypo- and hyper-methylation patterns during cancer progression, the generation of EMT and cell stemness in advanced PCa, and may pave the way to new therapeutic implications.""","""['C Pistore', 'E Giannoni', 'T Colangelo', 'F Rizzo', 'E Magnani', 'L Muccillo', 'G Giurato', 'M Mancini', 'S Rizzo', 'M Riccardi', 'N Sahnane', 'V Del Vescovo', 'K Kishore', 'M Mandruzzato', 'F Macchi', 'M Pelizzola', 'M A Denti', 'D Furlan', 'A Weisz', 'V Colantuoni', 'P Chiarugi', 'I M Bonapace']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['DNMT3A epigenetically regulates key microRNAs involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'DNMT1 Regulates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Cancer Stem Cells, Which Promotes Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'TGF-β induces global changes in DNA methylation during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer cells.', 'Multifaceted Roles of DNA Methylation in Neoplastic Transformation, from Tumor Suppressors to EMT and Metastasis.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer (Review).', 'Identification of INHBA as a potential biomarker for gastric cancer through a comprehensive analysis.', 'Population dynamics of EMT elucidates the timing and distribution of phenotypic intra-tumoral heterogeneity.', 'Epigenetic regulation and therapeutic targets in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Integrative characterisation of secreted factors involved in intercellular communication between prostate epithelial or cancer cells and fibroblasts.', 'Single-Cell Sequencing of Malignant Ascites Reveals Transcriptomic Remodeling of the Tumor Microenvironment during the Progression of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.']"""

Here, have we demonstrated that freshly isolated mouse and human NK cells express low levels of the endo-β-D-glucuronidase heparanase that increase upon NK cell activation. Heparanase deficiency did not affect development, differentiation, or tissue localization of NK cells under steady-state conditions. However, mice lacking heparanase specifically in NK cells (Hpsefl/fl NKp46-iCre mice) were highly tumor prone when challenged with the carcinogen methylcholanthrene (MCA). Hpsefl/fl NKp46-iCre mice were also more susceptible to tumor growth than were their littermate controls when challenged with the established mouse lymphoma cell line RMA-S-RAE-1β, which overexpresses the NK cell group 2D (NKG2D) ligand RAE-1β, or when inoculated with metastatic melanoma, prostate carcinoma, or mammary carcinoma cell lines. NK cell invasion of primary tumors and recruitment to the site of metastasis were strictly dependent on the presence of heparanase. Cytokine and immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for metastases was compromised when NK cells lacked heparanase. Our data suggest that heparanase plays a critical role in NK cell invasion into tumors and thereby tumor progression and metastases. This should be considered when systemically treating cancer patients with heparanase inhibitors, since the potential adverse effect on NK cell infiltration might limit the antitumor activity of the inhibitors.""","""['Eva M Putz', 'Alyce J Mayfosh', 'Kevin Kos', 'Deborah S Barkauskas', 'Kyohei Nakamura', 'Liam Town', 'Katharine J Goodall', 'Dean Y Yee', 'Ivan Kh Poon', 'Nikola Baschuk', 'Fernando Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes', 'Mark D Hulett', 'Mark J Smyth']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['RAE1 ligands for the NKG2D receptor are regulated by STING-dependent DNA sensor pathways in lymphoma.', 'A dual function of NKG2D ligands in NK-cell activation.', 'NK cell-extrinsic IL-18 signaling is required for efficient NK-cell activation by vaccinia virus.', 'Natural killer group 2D receptor and its ligands in cancer immune escape.', 'Cancer immunosurveillance: NKG2D breaks cover.', 'Heparanase-A single protein with multiple enzymatic and nonenzymatic functions.', 'Extracellular matrix remodeling in tumor progression and immune escape: from mechanisms to treatments.', 'Analysis of immunotherapeutic response-related signatures in esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma.', 'Heparanase-1: From Cancer Biology to a Future Antiviral Target.', 'Escape from NK cell tumor surveillance by NGFR-induced lipid remodeling in melanoma.']"""

We evaluated changes in CP after 6 months of medical castration with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues.  Methods and materials:   We performed a prospective, observational, multicenter, open-label study of PCa patients scheduled to receive LHRH analogues for ≥6 months. We assessed 4 domains of CP at baseline and after 6 months of ADT: (1) working memory, assessed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS III) Digit Span subtest; (2) visual memory, assessed with an ad hoc visual memory test; (3) visuospatial ability, assessed with the Judgment of Line Orientation test and Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects test; and (4) nonverbal analytical reasoning, assessed with the WAIS III Matrix Reasoning test.

After treatment and before removal of catheters, a posttreatment 1.5 T MRI was performed. Regions of interest were also delineated on the posttreatment MR images and the catheters of 17 patients were reconstructed. The dose plan was constructed for the posttreatment MRI scan to assess the influence of catheter migration and anatomical variation on the dose delivered to the target and the organs at risk. Also on the posttreatment MRI, the complete catheter reconstruction was reassessed, to correct for, for example, bending of the catheters. The displacement of catheters between the MRI scans was determined by comparing the catheter tip positions on the treatment planning and posttreatment 1.5 T MRI scans.  Results:   The displacements of 241 catheters were investigated. Average (range) displacements of the umbrella catheters are 0.6 (0-2.9) mm in the x-direction, 0.5 (0-2.1) mm in the y-direction, and 0.9 (0-5.5) mm in the z-direction. In 3 patients, the displacement was >4 mm and up to 5.5 mm. This occurred in respectively 1/13, 1/16, and 1/18 catheters in these patients. The dosimetric differences between the intraoperative treatment and the posttreatment plans were in most patients less than 1.5 Gy. In 4 patients, a dose difference in clinical target volume D95 of >2 Gy up to 5.8 Gy was reported. No discrimination can be made between dose differences due to catheter displacement and/or organ movement/anatomy changes.  Conclusions:   In general, catheter displacements were in the order of a mm and differences in dose to the clinical target volume and the organs at risk between the treatment and posttreatment plans smaller than 1.5 Gy. In some patients, dose differences up to 5.8 Gy were determined, due to either individual larger catheter displacement and/or anatomy changes. A longer followup is necessary to assess the clinical implications of individual large dose differences.""","""['Metha Maenhout', 'Jochem R N van der Voort van Zyp', 'Maxence Borot de Battisti', 'Max Peters', 'Marco van Vulpen', 'Maurice van den Bosch', 'Marinus A Moerland']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Dosimetric impact of intrafraction changes in MR-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric feasibility of ablative dose escalated focal monotherapy with MRI-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Automatic multi-catheter detection using deeply supervised convolutional neural network in MRI-guided HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Visualising the urethra for prostate radiotherapy planning.']"""

Methods:   Patients who underwent laparoscopic PN for a T1 renal mass between 2012 and 2016 and who also had a mercapto-acetyltriglycine renal scan prior to surgery were retrieved from a single institution prospectively-collected database. Split renal function (SRF) and Effective Renal Plasma Flow (ERPF) for both the operated kidney and the unaffected contralateral were calculated. Patient demographics and tumor characteristics (e.g. size, location and; nephrometry score) were assessed. Renal function of both the operated and the unaffected; contralateral kidney were compared. Statistical analysis was performed by using Statistica 8.0 (StatSoft).  Results:   227 patients were deemed eligible and included in the analysis. Univariable analysis showed a significant impact of age-adjusted CCI (p = 0.027), hypertension (p = 0.031) and age (p < 0.001) on operated kidney ERPF. Gender (p = 0.011), hypertension (p = 0.042), CCI (both standard and age-adjusted, p = 0.021 and = 0.003, respectively) and age (p < 0.001) were significantly; associated with contralateral unaffected kidney ERPF. Multivariable analysis confirmed age (p < 0.001) and hypertension (p < 0.021) as independent factors in both the operated and the unaffected kidney.  Conclusions:   Characteristics of the renal mass (including nephrometry score and size) seem to have no clinically relevant impact on baseline renal function in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy for cT1 renal tumors.

Given the increasing detection of measurable disease, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) changes warrant consideration to evaluate activity. We validated the association of RECIST 1.0 changes with survival in men with mCRPC receiving docetaxel.  Patients and methods:   Data for men with measurable disease from the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S0421, a phase 3 trial in men with mCRPC receiving docetaxel and prednisone plus placebo or atrasentan, were used. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the association of RECIST 1.0 outcomes within 120 days, ie, unconfirmed partial response (uPR), stable disease, and progressive disease (PD), with overall survival (OS) from day 120, adjusted for prognostic factors.  Results:   Overall, 326 men were evaluable for landmark analysis, of whom 23 had PD, 230 stable disease, and 73 uPR. OS beyond day 120 was significantly different (P = .004) among these subgroups, with median (95% confidence interval) OS of 7.1 (3.5-8.8), 13.4 (11.4-15.6), and 16.3 (10.0-19.6) months for those with PD, stable disease, and uPR, respectively. In a multivariable model, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for patients with PD was 2.47 (1.42-4.29) compared to patients with an uPR (P = .002).  Conclusion:   The association of RECIST 1.0 changes with OS in men with mCRPC receiving docetaxel was validated.

We assessed the effect of this combination in men starting long-term androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), using a multigroup, multistage trial design.  Methods:   We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive ADT alone or ADT plus abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily) and prednisolone (5 mg daily) (combination therapy). Local radiotherapy was mandated for patients with node-negative, nonmetastatic disease and encouraged for those with positive nodes. For patients with nonmetastatic disease with no radiotherapy planned and for patients with metastatic disease, treatment continued until radiologic, clinical, or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression; otherwise, treatment was to continue for 2 years or until any type of progression, whichever came first. The primary outcome measure was overall survival. The intermediate primary outcome was failure-free survival (treatment failure was defined as radiologic, clinical, or PSA progression or death from prostate cancer).  Results:   A total of 1917 patients underwent randomization from November 2011 through January 2014. The median age was 67 years, and the median PSA level was 53 ng per milliliter. A total of 52% of the patients had metastatic disease, 20% had node-positive or node-indeterminate nonmetastatic disease, and 28% had node-negative, nonmetastatic disease; 95% had newly diagnosed disease. The median follow-up was 40 months. There were 184 deaths in the combination group as compared with 262 in the ADT-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.76; P<0.001); the hazard ratio was 0.75 in patients with nonmetastatic disease and 0.61 in those with metastatic disease. There were 248 treatment-failure events in the combination group as compared with 535 in the ADT-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.34; P<0.001); the hazard ratio was 0.21 in patients with nonmetastatic disease and 0.31 in those with metastatic disease. Grade 3 to 5 adverse events occurred in 47% of the patients in the combination group (with nine grade 5 events) and in 33% of the patients in the ADT-alone group (with three grade 5 events).  Conclusions:   Among men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, ADT plus abiraterone and prednisolone was associated with significantly higher rates of overall and failure-free survival than ADT alone.

We evaluated the clinical benefit of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone with androgen-deprivation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed, metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 1199 patients to receive either androgen-deprivation therapy plus abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily, given once daily as four 250-mg tablets) plus prednisone (5 mg daily) (the abiraterone group) or androgen-deprivation therapy plus dual placebos (the placebo group). The two primary end points were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 30.4 months at a planned interim analysis (after 406 patients had died), the median overall survival was significantly longer in the abiraterone group than in the placebo group (not reached vs. 34.7 months) (hazard ratio for death, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.76; P<0.001).

Significantly better outcomes in all secondary end points were observed in the abiraterone group, including the time until pain progression, next subsequent therapy for prostate cancer, initiation of chemotherapy, and prostate-specific antigen progression (P<0.001 for all comparisons), along with next symptomatic skeletal events (P=0.009). These findings led to the unanimous recommendation by the independent data and safety monitoring committee that the trial be unblinded and crossover be allowed for patients in the placebo group to receive abiraterone.

Methods:   PTEN-/-/p53-/- PC cells and Los Angeles prostate cancer-4 (LAPC-4) cells were treated with GA for 24 h and 48 h, then cell viability was determined by cell proliferation assay. PTEN-/-/p53-/- PC cells organoids number was calculated under GA treatment for 1 week. In addition, cell titer glo assay was performed to analyze 3 dimensional cell viability of patients derived xenografts (PDX) 170.2 organoids. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptotic cells treated with GA. And confocal image was performed to detect the apoptotic mitochondrial morphological changes. Apoptotic cell death related protein levels were measured through Western blot (WB) in GA treated cells and organoids. The expression levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway related ribonucleic acid (RNAs) and proteins were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and WB, respectively.  Results:   The treatment of GA significantly reduced cell viability of PTEN-/-/p53-/- PC cells and LAPC-4 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In organoids, GA showed strong inhibition towards organoids' numbers and diameters and continuously led to a complete organoids inhibition with GA 150 nmol/L. Ex vivo results validated that GA 1 μmol/L inhibited 44.6% PDX170.2 organoids growth. As for mechanism, flow cytometry detected continuously increased apoptotic portion under GA treatment from 1.98% to 11.78% (6 h) and 29.94% (8 h, P<0.05). In addition, mitochondrial fragmentation emerged in GA treated cells indicated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway might be involved. Furthermore, WB detected caspases-3, -9 activation and light chain (LC)-3 conversion with GA treatment. WB revealed decreased activity of MAPK pathway and down-regulation of downstream c-fos oncogene RNA level was detected by RT-PCR before undergoing apoptosis (P<0.05).

Most studies of NOX4 in malignancy have focused on the evaluation of a small number of tumor cell lines and not on human tumor specimens themselves; furthermore, these studies have often employed immunological tools that have not been well characterized. To determine the prevalence of NOX4 expression across a broad range of solid tumors, we developed a novel monoclonal antibody that recognizes a specific extracellular region of the human NOX4 protein, and that does not cross-react with any of the other six members of the NOX gene family. Evaluation of 20 sets of epithelial tumors revealed, for the first time, high levels of NOX4 expression in carcinomas of the head and neck (15/19 patients), esophagus (12/18 patients), bladder (10/19 patients), ovary (6/17 patients), and prostate (7/19 patients), as well as malignant melanoma (7/15 patients) when these tumors were compared to histologically-uninvolved specimens from the same organs. Detection of NOX4 protein upregulation by low levels of TGF-β1 demonstrated the sensitivity of this new probe; and immunofluorescence experiments found that high levels of endogenous NOX4 expression in ovarian cancer cells were only demonstrable associated with perinuclear membranes. These studies suggest that NOX4 expression is upregulated, compared to normal tissues, in a well-defined, and specific group of human carcinomas, and that its expression is localized on intracellular membranes in a fashion that could modulate oxidative DNA damage.""","""['Jennifer L Meitzler', 'Hala R Makhlouf', 'Smitha Antony', 'Yongzhong Wu', 'Donna Butcher', 'Guojian Jiang', 'Agnes Juhasz', 'Jiamo Lu', 'Iris Dahan', 'Pidder Jansen-Dürr', 'Haymo Pircher', 'Ajay M Shah', 'Krishnendu Roy', 'James H Doroshow']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Redox Biol""","""['NADPH Oxidase NOX4 Is a Critical Mediator of BRAFV600E-Induced Downregulation of the Sodium/Iodide Symporter in Papillary Thyroid Carcinomas.', 'Downregulated NOX4 underlies a novel inhibitory role of microRNA-137 in prostate cancer.', 'BIAM switch assay coupled to mass spectrometry identifies novel redox targets of NADPH oxidase 4.', 'Potential benefits and harms of NADPH oxidase type 4 in the kidneys and cardiovascular system.', 'Reactive oxygen species and NADPH oxidase 4 involvement in osteoarthritis.', 'Mutant p53 and NOX4 are modulators of a CCL5-driven pro-migratory secretome.', 'NOX as a Therapeutic Target in Liver Disease.', 'Strategies to Counteract Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in Chronic-Degenerative Diseases.', 'Redox Homeostasis in Thyroid Cancer: Implications in Na+/I- Symporter (NIS) Regulation.', 'Disruption of Redox Homeostasis by Alterations in Nitric Oxide Synthase Activity and Tetrahydrobiopterin along with Melanoma Progression.']"""

This case-control study was done on 169 patients with pathologically confirmed PCa and 182 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Genotyping was done using PCR-RFLP method. The findings revealed that rs16917496 variant significantly increased the risk of PCa in codominant (OR=2.54, 95%CI=1.50-4.30, p<0.001, TC VS TT and OR=3.03, 95%CI=1.63-5.66, p<0.001, CC vs TT), dominant (OR=2.86, 95%CI=1.62-4.43, p<0.001, p<0.001). The C allele significantly increased the risk of PCa (OR=1.72, 95%CI=1.28-2.33, p<0.001) compared to T allele.

We therefore researched the effects of morin as an adjuvant to paclitaxel in in treating DU145 and PC-3 cells in vitro and DU145 derived prostate cancers in nude mice models. The chemosensitivities of these cells to the treatments of morin and paclitaxel were tested through viability assays utilizing cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) and apoptosis assays through flow cytometry analyses. MicroRNA (miRNA) microarray was employed to determine the changes in miRNA profile of morin treated DU145 cells. The results from microarrays were further certified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). The underlying targets of miR-155 were verified using luciferase assays followed by Western blot assays. In the results, morin was capable of repressing the cell viabilities in the paclitaxel-treated cells. MiR-155might be an effective target that can be down-regulated in morin-treated cells. We also discovered that GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) was directly repressed by miR-155, and the treatment of morin reversed the expression of GATA3.

Materials and methods:   We used a prospective database of 262 patients who underwent T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging before prostatectomy. For each lesion, two independent readers (R1, R2) prospectively defined nine features: shape, volume (V_Max), signal abnormality on each pulse sequence, number of pulse sequences with a marked (S_Max) and non-visible (S_Min) abnormality, likelihood of extracapsular extension (ECE) and PSA density (dPSA). Overall likelihood of malignancy was assessed using a 5-level Likert score. Features were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). csPCa was defined as Gleason ≥7 cancer (csPCa-A), Gleason ≥7(4+3) cancer (csPCa-B) or Gleason ≥7 cancer with histological extraprostatic extension (csPCa-C).  Results:   For csPCa-A, the Signal1 model (S_Max+S_Min) provided the best combination of signal-related variables, for both readers. The performance was improved by adding V_Max, ECE and/or dPSA, but not shape. All models performed better with DCE findings than without. When moving from csPCa-A to csPCa-B and csPCa-C definitions, the added value of V_Max, dPSA and ECE increased as compared to signal-related variables, and the added value of DCE decreased. For R1, the best models were Signal1+ECE+dPSA (AUC = 0,805 [95%CI:0,757-0,866]), Signal1+V_Max+dPSA (AUC = 0.823 [95%CI:0.760-0.893]) and Signal1+ECE+dPSA [AUC = 0.840 (95%CI:0.774-0.907)] for csPCa-A, csPCA-B and csPCA-C respectively. The AUCs of the corresponding Likert scores were 0.844 [95%CI:0.806-0.877, p = 0.11], 0.841 [95%CI:0.799-0.876, p = 0.52]) and 0.849 [95%CI:0.811-0.884, p = 0.49], respectively.

Methods:   J591(scFv) was expressed in HEK-293T cells and purified by metal ion affinity chromatography, followed by size exclusion chromatography. Stability and monomer/dimer ratios of purified scFv under different storage conditions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and analytical size exclusion chromatography. J591(scFv) was labelled with (Equation is included in full-text article.)at 37°C for 60 min. The stability of Tc-scFv in human serum was analysed by SDS-PAGE with autoradiography. Cell-binding studies were carried out using PC3LN3 (PSMA negative) and PC3LN3-PSMA (a variant engineered to express PSMA) cell lines.  Results:   J591(scFv) was most stable to dimerisation on storage at -80°C compared with -20 and 4°C. Radiochemical yields of 85-90% were obtained with the final radiochemical purity of more than 99% after purification by gel filtration. In these small-scale studies, the maximum specific activity achieved was 7 MBq/μg. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed the formation of Tc-J591(scFv), which was radiochemically stable in serum, with no dissociation of Tc over 24 h. Cell-binding assays showed specific binding to PSMA-positive cells.  Conclusion:   J591(scFv) can be radiolabelled with (Equation is included in full-text article.)conveniently and efficiently.

Azapeptides are peptidomimetics in which the α-carbon(s) of one or more amino acid residues are substituted by nitrogen. The resulting semicarbazide analogues have been shown to reinforce β-turn conformation through the combination of lone pair-lone pair repulsion of the adjacent hydrazine nitrogen and urea planarity. Substitution of a semicarbazide for an amino amide residue in a peptide may retain biological activity and add benefits such as improved metabolic stability. The applications of azapeptides include receptor ligands, enzyme inhibitors, prodrugs, probes, and imaging agents. Moreover, azapeptides have proven therapeutic utility. For example, the aza-glycinamide analogue of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue Zoladex is a potent long-acting agonist currently used in the clinic for the treatment of prostate and breast cancer. However, the use of azapeptides was hampered by tedious solution-phase synthetic routes for selective hydrazine functionalization. A remarkable stride to overcome this bottleneck was made in 2009 through the introduction of the submonomer procedure for azapeptide synthesis, which enabled addition of diverse side chains onto a common semicarbazone intermediate, providing a means to construct azapeptide libraries by solution- and solid-phase chemistry. In brief, aza residues are introduced into the peptide chain using the submonomer strategy by semicarbazone incorporation, deprotonation, N-alkylation, and orthogonal deprotection. Amino acylation of the resulting semicarbazide and elongation gives the desired azapeptide. Since the initial report, a number of chemical transformations have taken advantage of the orthogonal chemistry of semicarbazone residues (e.g., Michael additions and N-arylations). In addition, libraries have been synthesized from libraries by diversification of aza-propargylglycine (e.g., A3 coupling reactions, [1,3]-dipolar cycloadditions, and 5-exo-dig cyclizations) and aza-chloroalkylglycine residues. In addition, oxidation of aza-glycine residues has afforded azopeptides that react in pericyclic reactions (e.g., Diels-Alder and Alder-ene chemistry). The bulk of these transformations of aza-glycine residues have been developed by the Lubell laboratory, which has applied such chemistry in the synthesis of ligands with promising biological activity for treating diseases such as cancer and age-related macular degeneration. Azapeptide analogues of growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 (His-d-Trp-Ala-Trp-d-Phe-Lys-NH2, GHRP-6) have for example been pursued as ligands of the cluster of differentiation 36 receptor (CD36) and show promising activity for the development of treatments for angiogenesis-related diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, as well as for atherosclerosis. Azapeptides have also been employed to make a series of conformationally constrained second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) mimetics that exhibit promising apoptosis-inducing activity in cancer cells. The synthesis of cyclic azapeptide derivatives was used to make an aza scan to study the conformation-activity relationships of the anticancer agent cilengitide, cyclo(RGDf-N(Me)V), and its parent counterpart cyclo(RGDfV), which exhibit potency against human tumor metastasis and tumor-induced angiogenesis. Innovations in the synthesis and application of azapeptides will be presented in this Account, focusing on the creation and use of side-chain diversity in medicinal chemistry.""","""['Ramesh Chingle', 'Caroline Proulx', 'William D Lubell']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acc Chem Res""","""['Structure-activity relationships of GHRP-6 azapeptide ligands of the CD36 scavenger receptor by solid-phase submonomer azapeptide synthesis.', 'Solid phase submonomer azapeptide synthesis.', 'Azopeptides: Synthesis and Pericyclic Chemistry.', 'Azapeptides -A History of Synthetic Milestones and Key Examples.', 'Azapeptides and their therapeutic potential.', 'Computational Investigation of Conformational Properties of Short Azapeptides: Insights from DFT Study and NBO Analysis.', 'Impact of aza-substitutions on the preference of helix handedness for β-peptide oligomers: a DFT study.', 'Thiocarbazate building blocks enable the construction of azapeptides for rapid development of therapeutic candidates.', 'Sulfono-γ-AApeptides as Protein Helical Domain Mimetics to Manipulate the Angiogenesis.', 'Development of Reduced Peptide Bond Pseudopeptide Michael Acceptors for the Treatment of Human African Trypanosomiasis.']"""

Although the time variations of the static modulus of cells have been investigated, few studies have been reported on the dynamic variations of the frequency-dependent viscoelasticity of cells. Measuring and monitoring such dynamic evolutions of cells at nanoscale can be challenging as the measurement needs to meet two objectives inherently contradictory to each other-the measurement must be broadband (to cover a large frequency spectrum) but also rapid (to capture the time-elapsed changes). In this study, we exploited a recently developed control-based nanomechanical protocol of atomic force microscope to monitor in real time the dynamic evolutions of the viscoelasticity of live human prostate cancer cells (PC-3 cells) and study its dependence on myosin activities. We found that the viscoelasticity of PC-3 cells, followed the power law, and oscillated at a period of about 200 s.

However, the mechanisms driving overexpression of this receptor in cancer are poorly understood. This study investigates the role of androgen receptor (AR) in regulating CXCR7. Androgen deprivation or AR inhibition significantly increased CXCR7 expression in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell lines, which was accompanied by enhanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated mitogenic signaling, promoting tumor cell survival through an androgen-independent signaling program. Using multiple approaches we demonstrate that AR directly binds to the CXCR7 promoter, suppressing transcription. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) directed Cas9 nuclease-mediated gene editing of CXCR7 revealed that prostate cancer cells depend on CXCR7 for proliferation, survival and clonogenic potential. Loss of CXCR7 expression by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing resulted in a halt of cell proliferation, severely impaired EGFR signaling and the onset of cellular senescence. Characterization of a mutated CXCR7-expressing LNCaP cell clone showed altered intracellular signaling and reduced spheroid formation potential. Our results demonstrate that CXCR7 is a potential target for adjuvant therapy in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to prevent androgen-independent tumor cell survival.""","""['James J Hoy', 'Georgios Kallifatidis', 'Diandra K Smith', 'Bal L Lokeshwar']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Targeting the MIF/CXCR7/AKT Signaling Pathway in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and chemokine receptors 4 and 7 form a signaling axis to regulate CXCL12-dependent cellular motility.', 'β-Arrestin-2 Counters CXCR7-Mediated EGFR Transactivation and Proliferation.', 'Androgen receptor antagonists for prostate cancer therapy.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Chemokine receptor CXCR7 activates Aurora Kinase A and promotes neuroendocrine prostate cancer growth.', 'Myricetin alleviated hydrogen peroxide-induced cellular senescence of nucleus pulposus cell through regulating SERPINE1.', 'CXCR7 as a novel therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Atypical chemokine receptors: emerging therapeutic targets in cancer.', 'The power of heteronemin in cancers.']"""

The rates of the one-pot catalyst-free transformations of steroidal β-ketoaldehydes, ammonium acetate and substituted benzaldehydes in EtOH were found to be affected slightly by the steric and electronic feature of the substituents on the aromatic ring of the arylaldehyde component and the different reactivities of rings D and A of the sterane core. At the same time, the acid-catalyzed Biginelli-type reaction of dihydrotestosterone acetate, urea and arylaldehydes, and subsequent Jones oxidation of the primarily formed dihydropyrimidinones led to the corresponding ring A-fused 1H-pyrimidin-2-ones in moderate yields independently of the substituents on the aromatic moiety. The synthesized compounds were tested in vitro on human cancer cell lines as well as on non-cancerous fibroblast cells by the MTT assay in order to investigate their biological effects.

More restrictive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening guidelines have led to lower rates of screening, biopsy, and diagnosis of prostate cancer. It is not clear, however, how regions with low baseline screening rates (the Lebanon, New Hampshire hospital referral region centered on Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center had the lowest rate of screening among Medicare patients in 2012) have responded to these guidelines.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent prostate biopsy from January 2011 to March 2016. Demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by time. Multivariable analysis assessed for factors associated with higher grade cancer.  Results:   There were 614 prostate biopsies were performed. PSA at biopsy increased with time (7.2 in 2011 vs 10.1 in 2015, P = .0085); age did not. There was a stable proportion of benign findings; proportions of low-grade disease decreased, whereas intermediate- and high-grade disease increased (2011 vs 2015: 21.1% vs 10.8% Gleason 3 + 3, 32.9% vs 43.3% ≥ Gleason 3 + 4, P = .0454).

Conclusion:   In an environment of conservative baseline screening practices, there has been a shift in prostate biopsy criteria and outcomes, namely a rising PSA threshold for biopsy and a 50% decrease in the diagnosis of low-grade disease.

Radiation to the abdomen or pelvis may also cause radiation-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) which is often treated with anti-emetics such as serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists (RA). However, a common side effect of these anti-emetic medications is constipation. Both diarrhea and constipation can have a significant impact on patient quality of life (QOL). The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of diarrhea and constipation in patients receiving pelvic radiation and anti-emetics.  Methods:   Patients undergoing pelvic radiation between January 2011 and March 2017 at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre were enrolled in three prospective clinical trials studying the efficacy of various anti-emetics for RINV prophylaxis. Patients completed QOL questionnaires which included a single question about severity of constipation at baseline, day 5 and 10 during radiation if applicable, and day 5 and 10 after completion of radiation; severity was measured on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1= ""not at all"" to 4= ""very much"". Patients also recorded severity of diarrhea throughout baseline, treatment, and 10 days follow-up via daily diaries; responses were qualitative ranging from ""no diarrhea"" to ""severe diarrhea"" on a 4-point scale.  Results:   Fifty-nine patients received pelvic radiation across the three trials. The average constipation score at baseline was 1.69 [standard deviation (SD) 0.93], and increased up to 2.33 (SD 1.03) at day 10 during treatment. Following treatment, the average score decreased to 1.61 (SD 0.80) at day 10 follow-up with the majority of patients reporting no constipation at this time (57.7%). The average diarrhea score at baseline was 1.03 (SD 0.18) and remained stable throughout treatment and follow-up. A vast majority of patients reported no diarrhea after day 10 follow-up (96.4%).  Conclusions:   Constipation was more prevalent than diarrhea during radiation treatment and up to day 10 after radiation to the pelvis. Approximately 42% of patients will have constipation on day 10 post radiation.

Methods:   A prospective study evaluating the role of radiation therapy in a public academic hospital in São Paulo-Brazil recorded patients' opioid use, pain score, Portuguese version of QLQ-BM22 and QLQ-C30 before and 2 months after radiotherapy. Analgesic use and pain score were used to calculate international pain response category. Overall response was defined as the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). CR was defined as pain score of 0 with no increase in analgesic intake whereas PR was defined as pain reduction ≥2 without analgesic increase or analgesic reduction in ≥25% without increase in pain at the treated site.  Results:   From September 2014 to October 2015, 25 patients with bone metastases responded to RT or chemotherapy (1 CR, 24 PR). There were 8 male and 17 female patients.

Preclinical studies suggested that aberrant cholesterol regulators, receptors and transporters contribute to cholesterol accumulation uniformly. We assessed their association with features of aggressive cancers. In the prospective prostate cancer cohorts within the Health Professional Follow-up Study, the Physicians' Health Study and the Swedish Watchful Waiting Study, tumor mRNA expression profiling was performed. Lethal disease was defined as mortality or metastases from prostate cancer (n = 266) in contrast to non-lethal disease without metastases after >8 years of follow-up (n = 476). Associations with Gleason grade were additionally assessed using The Cancer Genome Atlas primary prostate cancer dataset (n = 333). Higher Gleason grade was associated with lower LDLR expression, lower SOAT1 and higher SQLE expression. Besides high SQLE expression, cancers that became lethal despite primary treatment were characterized by low LDLR expression (odds ratio for highest versus lowest quintile, 0.37; 95% CI 0.18-0.76) and by low SOAT1 expression (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI 0.21-0.83). The association of LDLR expression and lethality was not present in tumors with high IDOL expression. ABCA1, PCSK9 or SCARB1 expressions were not associated with Gleason grade or lethal cancer. In summary, prostate cancers that progress to lethal disease rely on de novo cholesterol synthesis (via SQLE), rather than transcellular uptake (via LDLR) or cholesterol esterification (via SOAT1).

Curative surgery was delivered in 48 patients (prostatectomy = 26, cystoprostatectomy = 22), usually with lymphadenectomy (n = 40). Curative radiotherapy (RT) was delivered in 32 patients, as radical (n = 5), neoadjuvant (n = 10), or postoperative treatment (n = 17). Eighteen patients received chemotherapy. None of the patients received hormonal therapy.  Results:   Median follow-up was 72 months (95%CI: 55-not reached).

Methods:   Tissue T (tT) and tissue DHT (tDHT) concentration were determined in 93 patients scheduled for initial prostate biopsy. The criteria for biopsy were abnormal DRE and/or PSA > 4 ng/mL. Total prostate volume (TPV) was determined by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). During TRUS- guided prostate biopsy, 10-12 samples were collected from the peripheral zone (PZ) and two additional samples were collected from the transition zone (TZ). The samples from the TZ were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen at -70°C, and transported for tissue androgen determination, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).  Results:   Pathological analysis revealed that prostate cancer (PCa) was present in 45 and absent in 48 patients. In the whole group, there were 42 men with small prostate (TPV < 30 mL) and 51 with enlarged prostate (TPV ≥ 31 mL). The overall average tT level was 0.79 ± 0.66 ng/g, while the average tDHT level was 10.27 ± 7.15 ng/g. There were no differences in tT and tDHT level in prostates with and without PCa. However, tT and tDHT levels were significantly higher in larger, than in smaller prostates (tT: 1.05 ± 0.75 and 0.46 ± 0.29 ng/g, and tDHT: 15.0 ± 6.09 and 4.51 ± 2.75 ng/g, respectively). There were strong correlations between tT and TPV (r = 0.71), and tDHT and TPV (r = 0.74).  Conclusions:   The present study confirmed that both T and DHT accumulated in the stroma of enlarged prostates; the degree of accumulation correlated with prostate volume.""","""['Tomislav Pejčić', 'Tomislav Tosti', 'Živoslav Tešić', 'Borivoj Milković', 'Dejan Dragičević', 'Milutin Kozomara', 'Milica Čekerevac', 'Zoran Džamić']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Differential effect of finasteride on the tissue androgen concentrations in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Intraprostatic testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.

The incidence of PC is increasing at an alarming rate across the globe. Progression of PC is associated with elevated levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in malignant cells. Overexpression of these players is accompanied by chronic inflammation, increased angiogenesis, proliferation, migration, and inhibition of apoptosis. Moreover, their elevated circulating levels promote the disease progression from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent state. Thus, inhibiting the expression of IL-8 and COX-2 would be a promising target in the development of PC therapeutics. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of Withania somnifera extract on highly metastatic, androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line (PC3). Additionally, we compared the real-time expression of IL-8 and COX-2 in prostate tissue samples.  Materials and methods:   The cell viability and cytotoxicity of W. somnifera extract in PC3 cells was quantified colorimetrically by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay, respectively. Hematoxylin and eosin staining for histological examination, trypan blue, and acridine orange dyes to enumerate apoptotic and live cells, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to determine the expression and flow cytometry to study the cell cycle analysis were used.  Results:   We observed a significant decrease in the cell viability with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10 μg/mL. The expression levels of IL-8 and COX-2 in prostate tissue samples and in PC3 cells were predominantly high; however, the lowest dose of W. somnifera significantly inhibited the enhanced expression of IL-8 and COX-2 in PC3 cells in 24 hours. Furthermore, W. somnifera extract (10 μg/mL) irreversibly arrested the cell cycle in G2/M phase, which was evident from the rapid accumulation of PC3 cells significantly.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that inherent metastatic and selective inhibitory potential of W. somnifera against PC. W. somnifera may be a good therapeutic agent in addition to the existing drugs for PC. Further studies with more prostate tissue samples are warranted.""","""['Anand Setty Balakrishnan', 'Abel Arul Nathan', 'Mukesh Kumar', 'Sudhakar Ramamoorthy', 'Sathish Kumar Ramia Mothilal']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate Int""","""['Viwithan, a Standardized Withania somnifera Root Extract Induces Apoptosis in Murine Melanoma Cells.', 'Anti-angiogenic, apoptotic and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory activity of Withania somnifera (ashwagandha) on lung adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Biological Effects of Hesperetin on Interleukin-6/Phosphorylated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 Pathway Signaling in Prostate Cancer PC3 Cells.', 'Withania somnifera - a magic plant targeting multiple pathways in cancer related inflammation.', 'Withania somnifera improves semen quality by combating oxidative stress and cell death and improving essential metal concentrations.', 'An updated review on phytochemistry and molecular targets of Withania somnifera (L.)

The goal of this study was to determine whether 68Ga-citrate (which avidly binds to circulating transferrin) can detect MYC-positive prostate cancer tumors, as the transferrin receptor is a direct MYC target gene. PET imaging paired with 68Ga-citrate and molecular analysis of preclinical models, human cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and clinical biopsies were conducted to determine whether 68Ga-citrate can detect MYC-positive prostate cancer. Importantly, 68Ga-citrate detected human prostate cancer models in a MYC-dependent fashion. In patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, analysis of cfDNA revealed that all patients with 68Ga-citrate avid tumors had a gain of at least one MYC copy number. Moreover, biopsy of two PET avid metastases showed molecular or histologic features characteristic of MYC hyperactivity. These data demonstrate that 68Ga-citrate targets prostate cancer tumors with MYC hyperactivity. A larger prospective study is ongoing to demonstrate the specificity of 68Ga-citrate for tumors with hyperactive MYC.Implications: Noninvasive measurement of MYC activity with quantitative imaging modalities could substantially increase our understanding of the role of MYC signaling in clinical settings for which invasive techniques are challenging to implement or do not characterize the biology of all tumors in a patient.

Consistently, pY14Cav1 enhanced CSD-dependent vinculin tension in focal adhesions, dampening force fluctuation and synchronously stabilizing cellular focal adhesions in a high-tension mode, paralleling effects of actin stabilization. This identifies pY14Cav1 as a molecular regulator of focal adhesion tension and suggests that functional interaction between Cav1 Y14 phosphorylation and the CSD promotes focal adhesion traction and, thereby, cancer cell motility.""","""['Fanrui Meng', 'Sandeep Saxena', 'Youtao Liu', 'Bharat Joshi', 'Timothy H Wong', 'Jay Shankar', 'Leonard J Foster', 'Pascal Bernatchez', 'Ivan R Nabi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Biol Cell""","""['Tyrosine phosphorylation of tumor cell caveolin-1: impact on cancer progression.', 'Concerted regulation of focal adhesion dynamics by galectin-3 and tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1.', 'Phosphorylated caveolin-1 regulates Rho/ROCK-dependent focal adhesion dynamics and tumor cell migration and invasion.', 'Contractility modulates cell adhesion strengthening through focal adhesion kinase and assembly of vinculin-containing focal adhesions.', 'Integrin-mediated cell adhesion: the cytoskeletal connection.', 'Pharmacological Activation of Potassium Channel Kv11.1 with NS1643 Attenuates Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cell Migration by Promoting the Dephosphorylation of Caveolin-1.', 'Stromal Fibroblasts Counteract the Caveolin-1-Dependent Radiation Response of LNCaP Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Glucocorticoid-mediated induction of caveolin-1 disrupts cytoskeletal organization, inhibits cell migration and re-epithelialization of non-healing wounds.', 'Single molecule network analysis identifies structural changes to caveolae and scaffolds due to mutation of the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain.', 'The Relevance of the SH2 Domain for c-Src Functionality in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

These can be used to generate maps of chromatin compartmentalization, demarcating open and closed chromatin across the genome. Additionally, large sets of genome-wide transcription factor binding profiles have been made available thanks to ChIP-seq technology.  Methods:   We have identified genomic regions with altered chromatin compartmentalization in prostate adenocarcinoma tissue relative to normal prostate tissue, using DNA methylation microarray data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. DNA binding profiles from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) ChIP-seq studies have been systematically screened to find transcription factors with inferred DNA binding sites located in discordantly open/closed chromatin in malignant tissue (compared with non-cancer control tissue). We have combined this with tests for corresponding up-/downregulation of the transcription factors' putative target genes to obtain an integrated measure of cancer-specific regulatory activity to identify likely transcriptional drivers of prostate cancer.  Results:   Generally, we find that the degree to which transcription factors preferentially bind regions of chromatin that become more accessible during prostate carcinogenesis is significantly associated to the level of systematic upregulation of their targets, at the level of gene expression. Our approach has yielded 11 transcription factors that show strong cancer-specific transcriptional activation of targets, including the novel candidates KAT2A and TRIM28, alongside established drivers of prostate cancer MYC, ETS1, GABP and YY1.  Conclusions:   This approach to integrated epigenetic and transcriptional profiling using publicly available data represents a cheap and powerful technique for identifying potential drivers of human disease.

Gankyrin is a novel oncoprotein which regulates cell cycle and protein degradation. Gankyrin overexpression correlated with the malignant phenotypes and promotes the tumorigenicity and metastasis in many cancers. However, there are not any reports on the role of Gankyrin in prostate cancer. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the expression of Gankyrin in prostate cancer and analyze its correlation with some clinicopathological characteristics.

Although the survival rate of men diagnosed with prostate cancer has increased with the improvement of treatments, drug resistance still remains a big challenge for improving overall survival. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated anion channel, has been reported to have a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various cancers, but its role in chemoresistance of prostate cancer cells is poorly understood. In our study, we found that CFTR expression was significantly increased in prostate cancer tissues associated the chemoresistance, and in the cisplatin-resistant cell line LNCaP/CP compared with their respective parental cells. Cisplatin treatment inhibited CFTR expression in a concentration-dependent manner, which was correlated with a decrease in cell viability. Moreover, inhibition of CFTR by transfection of small interfering RNA enhanced cisplatin-induced the decrease of cell viability. Autophagy was dramatically increased in LNCaP/CP cells, as evidenced by autopaphgic markers as well as fluorescence microscopy analysis of GFP-LC3, MDC and AO staining. Of note, inhibiting autophagy by 3MA induced LNCaP/CP cell apoptosis, showed by MTT assay and Hoechst 33258 staining. In addition, blockade of CFTR also inhibited LNCaP/CP cell viability and autophagy. Furthermore, the dephosphorylation of AKT and mTOR was reversed by CFTR inhibition, indicating the knockdown of CFTR might inhibit autophagy in LNCaP/CP cells via activation of AKT/mTOR signaling. Altogether, these results provide a novel understanding of the mechanism for acquired cisplatin. Inhibition of CFTR may be a useful strategy to increase the efficacy of cisplatin to treat prostate cancer by preventing the protective response of autophagy.""","""['Q Zhu', 'H Li', 'Y Liu', 'L Jiang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Neoplasma""","""['Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Downregulation of ATG14 by EGR1-MIR152 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis by inhibiting cyto-protective autophagy.', 'Expression of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins in cisplatin-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'mTOR is a fine tuning molecule in CDK inhibitors-induced distinct cell death mechanisms via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Cisplatin for cancer therapy and overcoming chemoresistance.', 'Identification of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator as a prognostic marker for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia via the whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of monozygotic twins and data mining.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Chloride Channels and Transporters: Roles beyond Classical Cellular Homeostatic pH or Ion Balance in Cancers.', 'ClC-5 Downregulation Induces Osteosarcoma Cell Apoptosis by Promoting Bax and tBid Complex Formation.', 'S-adenosylmethionine: A metabolite critical to the regulation of autophagy.']"""

Methods: Twenty-eight early onset (≤55 years) patients with PCa pathologically confirmed in the Peking University Third Hospital and Peking University Shougang Hospital from January 1st 2000 to August 31st 2016 were collected. There were 18 radical prostatectomy (RP) cases and 10 transrectal prostatic biopsy cases. Contemporaneously, 445 elderly (>55 years) patients were collected, of which 385 had detailed pathological information, were chosen as control group. The mean age of young group was 51 years (29-55 years). Follow-up data for 22 cases were available (1-110 months). The correlation of the clinicopathological features and prognosis were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Presurgical prostatic specific antigen (PSA) level was abnormal in young patients, with 18 cases (64.3%) had elevated fPSA level, 26 (92.9%) had increased tPSA level, and 26 (92.9%) had decreased fPSA/tPSA ratio. Gleason score (GS) was 8 in 10.7% (3/28) of cases, and 9 in 42.9% (12/28) of cases. Of the 18 patients with RP, 17 (94.4%) had pT stage ≥pT2c. PSA level (P=0.006) and GS (P=0.001) were positively correlated with pT stage. Family history of PCa in 1st degree relatives was found in 9.1% of the cases. During follow-up, 2 patients died of PCa, 7 patients showed progression within 24 months. There were no significant differences in PSA level and GS between young patients and elderly patients, while the former group was more likely to have incontinence (P=0.023), higher PSA levels (P=0.001), and lower overall survival (P=0.049). Only postsurgical PSA level was found to be negatively associated with overall survival (P=0.030) and cancer specific survival (P=0.021) in young patients. Conclusions: Presurgical PSA level and GS are positively correlated with pT stage of early onset PCa. Compared with elderly patients, young patients are more likely to have incontinence, higher postsurgical PSA level, and lower overall survival. Among all the parameters, only postsurgical PSA level shows an adverse impact on prognosis of early onset PCa. Young patients, especially those with family history, may benefit from studies on the susceptibility loci and phenotype of PCa.""","""['Y Wang', 'S J Du', 'J X Zhang', 'H Y He']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi""","""['External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Preoperative Prostate-specific Antigen Isoform p2PSA and Its Derivatives, %p2PSA and Prostate Health Index, Predict Pathologic Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: Results from a Multicentric European Prospective Study.', 'A solitary positive prostate cancer biopsy does not predict a unilateral lesion in radical prostatectomy specimens.', '""More men die with prostate cancer than because of it"" - an old adage that still holds true in the 21st century.', 'Expectant management of stage A-1 (T1a) prostate cancer utilizing serum PSA levels: a preliminary report.']"""

In particular, IR-A has a peculiar mitogenic potential and is activated not only by insulin but also by IGF-2. Previously, we identified discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) as a new IR-A interacting protein. DDR1, a non-integrin collagen tyrosine kinase receptor, is overexpressed in several malignancies and plays a role in cancer progression and metastasis.We now evaluated whether DDR1 is able to exert a role in breast cancer biology by functionally cross-talking with IR. In MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, IR and DDR1 co-immunoprecipitated and co-localized after insulin or IGF-2 stimulation. In a panel of breast cancer cells, DDR1 knockdown by specific siRNAs markedly inhibited IR downstream signaling as well as proliferation, migration and colony formation in response to insulin and IGF-2. These effects were accompanied by reduction of IR protein and mRNA expression, which involved both transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects. DDR1 overexpression elicited opposite effects. Bioinformatics analysis of public domain databases showed that IR and DDR1 co-expression significantly correlates with several clinically relevant histopathological and molecular features of human breast carcinomas.These findings demonstrate that, in human breast cancer cells, DDR1 regulates IR expression and ligand dependent biological actions.

We show for the first time that the natural and conserved expression of Gal-8 in tumour cells is responsible for the metastatic evolution of prostate cancer. In fact, Gal-8 controls the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and E-Cadherin expression, with a major impact on anoikis and homotypic aggregation of tumour cells, both being essential processes for the survival of circulating tumour cells during metastasis.

One confounding factor is that many prostate cancers express a TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene whose expression is increased both by androgens and by vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation. Two challenges that limit VDR agonist use clinically are hypercalcemia and the cooperation of VDR with ERG to hyper-induce the 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 metabolizing enzyme, CYP24A1, thus reducing VDR activity. Using the VCaP TMPRSS2:ERG positive cell line as a model, we found that a nonsecosteroidal CYP24A1 resistant VDR agonist, VDRM2, substantially reduces growth of xenograft tumors without inducing hypercalcemia. Utilizing next generation RNA sequencing, we found a very high overlap of 1,25D(OH)2D3 and VDRM2 regulated genes and by drawing upon previously published datasets to create an ERG signature, we found activation of VDR does not induce ERG activity above the already high basal levels present in VCaP cells. Moreover, we found VDR activation opposes 8 of the 10 most significant ERG regulated Hallmark gene set collection pathways from Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).

Materials and methods:   Patients with anaplastic prostate carcinoma (n = 101) underwent CT and bone scans before platinum-based chemotherapy. CT findings were retrospectively reviewed to identify the sites of metastases. CT findings were correlated with baseline PSA levels. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to correlate PSA levels between patients with metastases at osseous and nonosseous sites. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was also used to correlate the type of bone metastases (blastic vs lytic) and the PSA levels.  Results:   Eighty-three of 101 patients (82%) had osseous metastases. PSA levels were significantly higher in patients with bone metastases than in patients without osseous metastases. However, 23 of the 83 patients (28%) with bone metastases had PSA levels in the normal range (i.e., < 4 ng/mL). The type of bone metastases (blastic vs lytic) did not show any statistically significant correlation to the PSA levels. Overall, 63 of 101 patients (62%) had nonosseous distant metastases at one or more sites, including the liver (n = 34), lung (n = 24), mediastinum (n = 31), pleura (n = 7), brain (n = 9), adrenal glands (n = 6), peritoneum (n = 4), and spleen (n = 1).

Conclusion:   Patients with the anaplastic clinical variant of prostate cancer have a high frequency of typical and atypical sites of metastases. Common sites of nonosseous distant metastases include the liver, lung, mediastinum, pleura, brain, and adrenal glands. PSA levels are unreliable and may be disproportionately low, despite the presence of multifocal large-volume metastases.

The separation is based on the size difference of the cancer cells and white blood cells, and is conducted in a custom-made biocompatible ferrofluid that retains not only excellent short-term viabilities but also normal proliferations of 7 commonly used cancer cell lines. A microfluidic device is designed and optimized specifically to shorten the time of live cells' exposure to ferrofluids from hours to seconds, by eliminating time-consuming off-chip sample preparation and extraction steps and integrating them on-chip to achieve a one-step process. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a ferrofluid with 0.26% volume fraction was used in this microfluidic device to separate spiked cancer cells from cell lines at a concentration of ∼100 cells per mL from white blood cells with a throughput of 1.2 mL h-1. The separation efficiencies were 80 ± 3%, 81 ± 5%, 82 ± 5%, 82 ± 4%, and 86 ± 6% for A549 lung cancer, H1299 lung cancer, MCF-7 breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines, respectively. The separated cancer cells' purity was between 25.3% and 28.8%. In addition, the separated cancer cells from this strategy showed an average short-term viability of 94.4 ± 1.3%, and these separated cells were cultured and demonstrated normal proliferation to confluence even after the separation process. Owing to its excellent biocompatibility and label-free operation and its ability to recover low concentrations of cancer cells from white blood cells, this method could lead to a promising tool for rare cell separation.""","""['Wujun Zhao', 'Rui Cheng', 'So Hyun Lim', 'Joshua R Miller', 'Weizhong Zhang', 'Wei Tang', 'Jin Xie', 'Leidong Mao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Lab Chip""","""['Label-free ferrohydrodynamic cell separation of circulating tumor cells.', 'Label-free Separation of Circulating Tumor Cells Using a Self-Amplified Inertial Focusing (SAIF) Microfluidic Chip.', 'Investigation of a Novel Microfluidic Device for Label-Free Ferrohydrodynamic Cell Separation on a Rotating Disk.', 'Large-Volume Microfluidic Cell Sorting for Biomedical Applications.', 'Advances of lab-on-a-chip in isolation, detection and post-processing of circulating tumour cells.', 'Measuring cell deformation by microfluidics.', 'Recent Advances in Microfluidic Platform for Physical and Immunological Detection and Capture of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'High-Resolution Separation of Nanoparticles Using a Negative Magnetophoretic Microfluidic System.', 'Fundamentals of integrated ferrohydrodynamic cell separation in circulating tumor cell isolation.', 'Opto-magnetic Selection and Isolation of Single Cells.']"""

Data were retrieved from the North Region Cancer Registry of Portugal database. The top 20 cancer sites in adults were considered: oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, liver, larynx, lung, skin melanoma, breast, cervix, corpus uteri, ovary, prostate, kidney, bladder, brain and central nervous system, thyroid, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Net survival was estimated using the Pohar-Perme estimator. The effect of diagnosis period was evaluated using flexible parametric models adjusted for age and sex where appropriate. Thyroid and prostate cancers presented the best 5-year survival (>90%), whereas oesophagus, pancreas, liver and lung cancers the worst 5-year survival (<20%). The largest increase in survival was observed for the larynx. A significant decrease in age-adjusted and sex-adjusted excess mortality was observed for stomach, colon, pancreas, larynx, melanoma, breast, brain and central nervous system, thyroid, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma. For the other cancer sites, no significant trends were observed. For some of these sites, the downward trend in excess mortality was only observed in the short term. An important picture of population-based cancer survival outcomes for the first decade of the millennium in the north region of Portugal was presented in this study.

We also extend the standard model to include quadratic terms for age, period, and cohort, along with the corresponding random effects, which quantify possible stratum-specific departures from global curvature.

However, assessment of local recurrence (LR) may be limited by intense physiologic tracer accumulation in the urinary bladder on whole-body scans, normally conducted 60 min post-tracer injection (p.i.). It could be shown on early dynamic imaging studies that 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in PC lesions occurs earlier than tracer accumulation in the urinary bladder. This study aims to investigate whether early static PET acquisition increases detection rate of local recurrence on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in comparison to PET imaging 60 min p.i..  Methods:   203 consecutive PC patients with biochemical failure referred to 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were analysed retrospectively (median prostate specific antigen (PSA) value: 1.44 ng/ml). In addition to whole-body PET/CT scans 60 min p.i., early static imaging of the pelvis was performed, starting at a median time of 283 s p.i. (range: 243-491 s). Assessment was based on visual analysis and calculation of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of pathologic lesions present in the pelvic area found on early PET imaging and on 60 min-PET scans.  Results:   26 patients (12.8%) were judged positive for LR on PET scans 60 min p.i. (median SUVmax: 10.8; range: 4.7-40.9), whereas 50 patients (24.6%) revealed a lesion suggestive of LR on early PET imaging (median SUVmax: 5.9; range: 2.9-17.6), resulting in a significant rise in detection rate (p < 0.001). Equivocal findings on PET scans 60 min p.i. decreased significantly with the help of early imaging (15.8% vs. 4.5% of patients; p < 0.001). Tracer activity in the urinary bladder with a median SUVmax of 8.2 was present in 63 patients on early PET scans (31.0%). However, acquisition starting time of early PET scans differed significantly in the patient groups with and without urinary bladder activity (median starting time of 321 vs. 275 s p.i.; range: 281-491 vs. 243-311 s p.i.; p < 0.001). Median SUVmax value of lesions suggestive of LR on early images was significantly higher in comparison to gluteal muscle, inguinal vessels and seminal vesicle/anastomosis (median SUVmax: 5.9 vs. 1.9, 4.0 and 2.4, respectively).  Conclusions:   Performance of early imaging in 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in addition to whole-body scans 60 min p.i. increases the detection rate of local recurrence in PC patients with biochemical recurrence. Acquisition of early PET images should be started as early as 5 min p.i. in order to avoid disturbing tracer activity in the urinary bladder occuring at a later time point.""","""['Christian Uprimny', 'Alexander Stephan Kroiss', 'Josef Fritz', 'Clemens Decristoforo', 'Dorota Kendler', 'Elisabeth von Guggenberg', 'Bernhard Nilica', 'Johanna Maffey-Steffan', 'Gianpaolo di Santo', 'Jasmin Bektic', 'Wolfgang Horninger', 'Irene Johanna Virgolini']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Early dynamic imaging in 68Ga- PSMA-11 PET/CT allows discrimination of urinary bladder activity and prostate cancer lesions.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '(68)Ga-PSMA-11 dynamic PET/CT imaging in biochemical relapse of prostate cancer.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'The Diagnostic Performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Early Recurrence after Definitive Therapy with a PSA <10 ng/ml.', 'Is there more than meets the eye in PSMA imaging in prostate cancer with PET/MRI?

Induction of autophagy is a prerequisite for cadmium-induced transformation and metastasis. The ability of Psoralidin (Pso), a non-toxic, orally bioavailable compound to inhibit cadmium-induced autophagy to prevent prostate cancer was investigated.  Methods:   Psoralidin was studied using cadmium-transformed prostate epithelial cells (CTPE), which exhibit high proliferative, invasive and colony forming abilities. Gene and protein expression were evaluated by qPCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Xenograft models were used to study the chemopreventive effects in vivo.  Results:   Cadmium-transformed prostate epithelial cells were treated with Pso resulting in growth inhibition, without causing toxicity to normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1). Psoralidin-treatment of CTPE cells inhibited the expression of Placenta Specific 8, a lysosomal protein essential for autophagosome and autolysosome fusion, which resulted in growth inhibition. Additionally, Pso treatment caused decreased expression of pro-survival signalling proteins, NFκB and Bcl2, and increased expression of apoptotic genes. In vivo, Pso effectively suppressed CTPE xenografts growth, without any observable toxicity. Tumours from Pso-treated animals showed decreased autophagic morphology, mesenchymal markers expression and increased epithelial protein expression.

We have previously reported that factors released from cancer cells mounting a UPR induce a de novo UPR in bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells that facilitates protumorigenic characteristics in culture and tumor growth in vivo. We investigated whether this intercellular signaling, which we have termed transmissible ER stress (TERS), also operates between cancer cells and what its functional consequences were within the tumor. We found that TERS signaling induced a UPR in recipient human prostate cancer cells that included the cell surface expression of the chaperone GRP78. TERS also activated Wnt signaling in recipient cancer cells and enhanced resistance to nutrient starvation and common chemotherapies such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel. TERS-induced activation of Wnt signaling required the UPR kinase and endonuclease IRE1. However, TERS-induced enhancement of cell survival was predominantly mediated by the UPR kinase PERK and a reduction in the abundance of the transcription factor ATF4, which prevented the activation of the transcription factor CHOP and, consequently, the induction of apoptosis.

Near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) is a highly selective tumor treatment that employs an antibody-photoabsorber conjugate (APC). Here, we describe the efficacy of NIR-PIT, using a fully human IgG1 anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody (mAb), conjugated to the photoabsorber, IR700DX, in a PSMA-expressing PC3 prostate cancer cell line. Anti-PSMA-IR700 showed specific binding and cell-specific killing was observed after exposure of the cells to NIR light in vitro In the in vivo study, anti-PSMA-IR700 showed high tumor accumulation and high tumor-background ratio. Tumor-bearing mice were separated into 4 groups: (i) no treatment; (ii) 100 μg of anti-PSMA-IR700 i.v.; (iii) NIR light exposure; (iv) 100 μg of anti-PSMA-IR700 i.v., NIR light exposure was administered. These were performed every week for up to 3 weeks. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited by NIR-PIT treatment compared with the other control groups (P < 0.001), and significantly prolonged survival was achieved (P < 0.0001 vs. other control groups). More than two thirds of tumors were cured with NIR-PIT. In conclusion, the anti-PSMA antibody is suitable as an APC for NIR-PIT. Furthermore, NIR-PIT with the anti-PSMA-IR700 antibody is a promising candidate of the treatment of PSMA-expressing tumors and could be readily translated to humans.Implications: NIR-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) using a fully human anti-PSMA-IR700 conjugate showed potential therapeutic effects against a PSMA-expressing prostate cancer that is readily translated to humans.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the frequency of a PSA bounce following high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer is associated with individual treatment fraction size.  Methods and materials:   Between 1999 and 2014, 554 patients underwent treatment of low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer with definitive HDR brachytherapy as monotherapy and had ≥3 subsequent PSA measurements. Four different fraction sizes were used: 950 cGy × 4 fractions, 1200 cGy × 2 fractions, 1350 cGy × 2 fractions, 1900 cGy × 1 fraction. Four definitions of PSA bounce were applied: ≥0.2, ≥0.5, ≥1.0, and ≥2.0 ng/mL above the prior nadir with a subsequent return to the nadir.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 3.7 years. The actuarial 3-year rate of PSA bounce for the entire cohort was 41.3%, 28.4%, 17.4%, and 6.8% for nadir +0.2, +0.5, +1.0, and +2.0 ng/mL, respectively. The 3-year rate of PSA bounce >0.2 ng/mL was 42.2%, 32.1%, 41.0%, and 59.1% for the 950-, 1200-, 1350-, and 1900-cGy/fraction levels, respectively (P=.002). The hazard ratio for bounce >0.2 ng/mL for patients receiving a single fraction of 1900 cGy compared with those receiving treatment in multiple fractions was 1.786 (P=.024). For patients treated with a single 1900-cGy fraction, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year rates of PSA bounce exceeding the Phoenix biochemical failure definition (nadir +2 ng/mL) were 4.5%, 18.7%, and 18.7%, respectively, higher than the rates for all other administered dose levels (P=.025).  Conclusions:   The incidence of PSA bounce increases with single-fraction HDR treatment.

However, pre-processing of methylation microarray data is challenging because of confounding factors that include background fluorescence, dye bias and the impact of germline polymorphisms. Therefore, we present valuable insights and a framework for those seeking the most optimal pre-processing method through a data-driven approach.  Results:   Here, we show that Dasen is the optimal pre-processing methodology for the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array in prostate cancer, a frequently employed platform for tumour methylome profiling in both the TCGA and ICGC consortia. We evaluated the impact of 11 pre-processing methods on batch effects, replicate variabilities, sensitivities and sample-to-sample correlations across 809 independent prostate cancer samples, including 150 reported for the first time in this study. Overall, Dasen is the most effective for removing artefacts and detecting biological differences associated with tumour aggressivity. Relative to the raw dataset, it shows a reduction in replicate variances of 67% and 76% for β- and M-values, respectively.

The impact of immigration on cancer-related outcomes is less clear.  Methods:   Administrative databases were linked to create a cohort of incident cancer cases (colorectal, lung, prostate, head and neck, breast, and hematologic malignancies) from 2000 to 2012 in Ontario, Canada. Cancer patients who immigrated to Canada (from 1985 onward) were compared with those who were Canadian born (or immigrated before 1985). Patients were followed from diagnosis until death (cancer-specific or all-cause). Cox proportional hazards models were estimated to determine the impact of immigration on mortality after adjusting for explanatory variables. Additional adjusted models studied the relationship of time since immigration and cancer-specific and overall mortality.  Results:   From 2000 to 2012, 11,485 cancer cases were diagnosed in recent immigrants (0 to 10 years in Canada), 17,844 cases in nonrecent immigrants (11 to 25 years), and 416,118 cases in nonimmigrants. After adjustment, the hazard of mortality was lower for recent immigrants (hazard ratio [HR], 0.843; 95% CI, 0.814 to 0.873) and nonrecent immigrants (HR, 0.902; 95% CI, 0.876 to 0.928) compared with nonimmigrants. Cancer-specific mortality was also lower for recent immigrants (HR, 0.857; 95% CI, 0.823 to 0.893) and nonrecent immigrants (HR, 0.907; 95% CI, 0.875 to 0.94). Among immigrants, each year from the original landing was associated with increased mortality (HR, 1.004; 95% CI, 1.000 to 1.009) and a trend to increased cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.005; 95% CI, 0.999 to 1.010).

Many studies have demonstrated that neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) could act as independent prognostic indicators for several solid tumors. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical implications of pretreatment inflammatory biomarkers, including NLR, PLR, and RDW as independent prognostic indicators in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   A total of 226 PCa patients who were diagnosed at our institution from 2011 to 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. We compared the clinicopathological features, survival curves, and prognosis of the PCa patients between the high and low groups according to the cutoffs of NLR, PLR, and RDW.  Results:   The pretreatment NLR, PLR, and RDW values were significantly higher in the patients with PCa than those in the controls (P<.05). Increased NLR and PLR values were significantly associated with high risk of progression, including higher Gleason scores, cell proliferation antigen 67 (Ki-67) indexes, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (P<.05), whereas an elevated RDW was only associated with an older age. An increased NLR was correlated with both overall survival (OS) (P=.025) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P=.017). In addition, a higher PLR only showed a significantly worse DFS (P=.040). Pretreatment NLR was an independent prognostic indicator of DFS.  Conclusions:   The pretreatment NLR and PLR might be beneficial to predict the progression and prognosis of PCa.

Activated α6-integrins promoted metastatic capacity and anoikis resistance, and led to perturbed growth of MDCK cysts.

The complex nature of cancer metastasis is recently investigated using several 3D scaffold models. Herein, we report a polymer-nanoclay-based in vitro tumour model that recapitulates early stage of prostate cancer (PCa) colonization during skeletal metastasis on bone mimetic scaffolds. A unique cell culture system termed as ""sequential culture (SC)"" has been applied to create a bone-mimetic niche for colonization of PCa cells. Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were seeded on the bone-mimetic scaffolds, where they differentiated into bone cells and then formed mineralized bone matrix without osteogenic supplements. Further, PCa was seeded on MSCs-seeded scaffolds. Sequentially cultured PCa cells with MSCs formed self-organized multicellular tumoroids with distinct tight cellular junctions and hypoxic core regions. Extensive quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments were performed to evaluate the expressions of genes related to osteotropic bone metastasis of PCa. On the nanoclay scaffolds, the MSCs differentiated to mature osteoblasts and epithelial to mesenchymal transition was inhibited whereas mesenchymal to epithelial transition was enhanced, as also the hypoxia increased angiogenesis, and finally, PCa cells initiated osteoblastic lesion. Further, the SC technique has significant effects on expression of key metastasis-related genes. Therefore, the SC-based tumour model can be applied to recapitulate more consistent osteotropic cancer cell behavior in understanding tumour biology. This model also can be implemented for drug screening to target colonization stage of PCa cells in the bone microenvironment.""","""['Md Shahjahan Molla', 'Dinesh R Katti', 'Kalpana S Katti']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Tissue Eng Regen Med""","""['Sequential culture on biomimetic nanoclay scaffolds forms three-dimensional tumoroids.', '3D porous chitosan-alginate scaffold stiffness promotes differential responses in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Calcium phosphate scaffolds with defined interconnecting channel structure provide a mimetic 3D niche for bone marrow metastasized tumor cell growth.', '3D Bone Biomimetic Scaffolds for Basic and Translational Studies with Mesenchymal Stem Cells.', 'The multifaceted role of mesenchymal stem cells in cancer.', 'Interstitial fluid flow contributes to prostate cancer invasion and migration to bone; study conducted using a novel horizontal flow bioreactor.', 'Nano-Hydroxyapatite/PLGA Mixed Scaffolds as a Tool for Drug Development and to Study Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the Bone.', 'The Influence of Fluid Shear Stress on Bone and Cancer Cells Proliferation and Distribution.', 'Label-free discrimination of tumorigenesis stages using in vitro prostate cancer bone metastasis model by Raman imaging.', 'Nanostructured Biomaterials for In Vitro Models of Bone Metastasis Cancer.']"""

Here we investigated VSIG1 expression in 11 cancers and assessed the prognostic roles of VSIG1 in patients with gastric cancer (GC) (n = 362) and non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 650). V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 1 was downregulated in 60.5% of GC specimens, and high VSIG1 expression was identified as an independent favorable prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.96). Among lung adenocarcinomas (n = 428), VSIG1 was significantly and inversely associated with thyroid transcription factor 1 expression and was frequently expressed in the invasive mucinous subtype (17 of 19, 89.5%). In addition, VSIG1 was expressed in a subset of pancreatic, ovarian, and prostate cancers. The variant 2 VSIG1 transcript was the dominant form in these tissues and cancer cells. Introduction of VSIG1 significantly reduced the proliferative ability of MKN1 and MKN28 GC cells and H1299 lung cancer cells and downregulated cell migration of these cells, as well as of KYSE150, an esophageal cancer cell line. Cell invasion of MKN1, MKN28, and KYSE150 cells was also reduced by VSIG1 introduction. In vitro characterization revealed that VSIG1 forms homodimers through homophilic cis-interactions but not through homophilic trans-interactions.

However, the precise role of Akt1 in advanced cancers is conflicting. Using a neuroendocrine TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model, we first show that the genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of Akt1 in mice blunts oncogenic transformation and prostate cancer (PCa) growth. Intriguingly, triciribine (TCBN)-mediated Akt inhibition in 25-week old, tumor-bearing TRAMP mice and Akt1 gene silencing in aggressive PCa cells enhanced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promoted metastasis to the lungs. Mechanistically, Akt1 suppression leads to increased expression of EMT markers such as Snail1 and N-cadherin and decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in TRAMP prostate, and in PC3 and DU145 cells. Next, we identified that Akt1 knockdown in PCa cells results in increased production of TGFβ1 and its receptor TGFβ RII, associated with a decreased expression of β-catenin. Furthermore, treatment of PCa cells with ICG001 that blocks nuclear translocation of β-catenin promoted EMT and N-cadherin expression.

Herein, we reported that among the FZD family, FZD8 was robustly upregulated in bone-metastastic PCa cell lines and tissues. High levels of FZD8 expression were significantly positively associated with clinical tumor progression and bone metastasis. Furthermore, we found that overexpressing FZD8 promoted, whereas silencing FZD8 suppressed, PCa cell migration, invasion and stem cell-like phenotypes in vitro, through the activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Importantly, downregulation of FZD8 greatly suppressed the incidence of PCa bone metastasis in vivo.

Analysts were blinded to group assignment. Semi-structured phone interviews with patients were conducted 1-week post consultation. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. Qualitative analytic techniques were used to extract salient themes and conduct a comparative analysis of the two groups.  Results:   Four salient themes emerged-1) knowledge acquisition, 2) decision-making style, 3) decision-making about timing of HT, and 4) anxiety-coping mechanisms. A comparative analysis showed that patients receiving the DA intervention had a better comprehension of Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an improved understanding of HT treatment implications, an external locus-of-control, participation in shared decision-making and, support-seeking for anxiety reduction. In contrast, SoC patients displayed worse comprehension of PSA testing and HT treatment implications, internal locus-of-control, unilateral involvement in knowledge-seeking and decision-making, and no support-seeking for anxiety-coping.  Conclusions:   The DA was more effective than the SoC group in helping PCa patients understand the full implications of PSA testing and treatment; motivating shared decision-making, and support-seeking for anxiety relief.

Anti-SOX2 antibody was used as a biorecognition molecule and was covalently immobilized onto the ITO thin film modified with CTES. Immobilization steps were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The optimum immobilization conditions such as antibody concentration, antibody and antigen incubation times were examined for the best sensitivity of the immunosensor.

The intrinsic radiation sensitivity of cancer cells could be enhanced by modulating multiple factors including the capacity to repair DNA damage, especially double-strand breaks (DSBs). We aimed to examine the effect of zerumbone on radiation sensitivity and its protective effects against ionizing radiation-induced DSB in human prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   The human prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cell lines were used. A colony formation assay was performed to analyze the radiation survival of cells. DNA histogram and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were examined using flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of regulatory molecules related to DNA damage repair.  Results:   Pretreatment with zerumbone enhanced the radiation effect on prostate cancer cells. Zerumbone delayed the abrogation of radiation-induced expression of γ-H2AX, an indicator of DNA DSB. Zerumbone pretreatment markedly reduced ionizing radiation-induced upregulated expression of phosphorylated ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated), which was partially reversed by the ATM agonist methyl methanesulfonate.

Abnormal regulation of YAP was reported in human cancers including liver, lung, breast, skin, colon, and ovarian cancer. However, the function of YAP is not known in prostate adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of YAP in tumorigenesis, differentiation, and prognosis of prostate adenocarcinoma.  Methods:   The nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of YAP was examined in 188 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma using immunohistochemistry. YAP expression levels were evaluated in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the prostate adenocarcinoma and the adjacent normal prostate tissue. The presence of immunopositive tumor cells was evaluated and interpreted in comparison with the patients' clinicopathologic data.  Results:   YAP expression levels were not significantly different between normal epithelial cells and prostate adenocarcinoma. However, YAP expression level was significantly higher in carcinomas with a high Gleason grades (8-10) than in carcinomas with a low Gleason grades (6-7) (p < .01). There was no statistical correlation between YAP expression and stage, age, prostate-specific antigen level, and tumor volume. Biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival was significantly lower in patients with high YAP expressing cancers (p = .02). However high YAP expression was not an independent prognostic factor for BCR in the Cox proportional hazards model.  Conclusions:   The results suggested that YAP is not associated with prostate adenocarcinoma development, but it may be associated with the differentiation of the adenocarcinoma.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included 49 prostate cancer patients, with prostate size >47 cm3, who underwent an endorectal MRI followed by RARP. Five BPH patterns were identified according to Wasserman, and additional prostate measurements were recorded. LUTS were assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score and the PR25-LUTS-Questionnaire score. Continence was assessed using the International Consultation of Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form.  Results:   BPH pattern 3 (44.9%) was identified most common, followed by pattern 5 (26.6%), 1 (24.5%), and 2 and 4 (both 2%). BPH patterns were significant predictors of preoperative LUTS, with pedunculated with bilateral transition zone (TZ) and retrourethral enlargement (pattern 5) causing more severe symptoms compared with bilateral TZ and retrourethral enlargement (pattern 3) and bilateral TZ enlargement (pattern 1), whereas pattern 3 was additionally associated with more voiding symptoms compared with pattern 1. None of the BPH patterns was predictive of postoperative LUTS and continence. Independent predictors of continence at 12 months were lower preoperative PR25-LUTS score (P = .022) and longer membranous urethral length (P = .025).  Conclusion:   MRI is useful for classifying patients in BPH patterns which are strongly associated with preoperative LUTS.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 2 attenuated regimens more widely used in an Asian setting to minimise toxicity - 60 mg/m2 Q3W and weekly docetaxel (20 mg/m2 to 35 mg/m2).  Materials and methods:   Medical records of 89 CRPC patients between December 2003 and April 2013 were reviewed. Pairwise statistical analysis was performed, comparing efficacy and safety outcomes of 75 mg/m2 Q3W and weekly docetaxel with 60 mg/m2 Q3W. Treatment endpoints used were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (decrease of ≥50% from baseline), pain improvement after cycle 2, overall survival, time to disease progression and radiological response.  Results:   Patients who received docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 Q3W were younger than those who received 60 mg/m2 Q3W (62 years and 66 years, respectively; P = 0.0489). Both groups had similar response rates. Compared with patients on 60 mg/m2 Q3W, more patients on weekly regimens were symptomatic at baseline (63.2% and 87.5%, respectively; P = 0.0173). Longer overall survival was observed in the 60 mg/m2 Q3W arm than the weekly docetaxel arm (16.9 months and 10.6 months, respectively; P = 0.0131), though other measures of response did not differ significantly.  Conclusion:   Our data supports the use of 60 mg/m2 Q3W docetaxel which has similar efficacy and an acceptable toxicity profile compared to the standard 75 mg/m2 Q3W regimen.

Multidisciplinary staff approved the treatment, and recurrence was biopsy-proven when feasible. A dose of 36 Gy was prescribed in six fractions. Treatment was delivered every other day.  Results:   Between August 2011 and February 2014, 23 patients were treated with SBRT for intra-prostate cancer recurrence with a median follow up of 22 months (6 to 40). Twenty patients had biopsy-proven recurrence. For 19 patients, EBRT was the initial treatment and in four patients, brachytherapy was the initial treatment; the median relapse-time from initial treatment was 65 months (28 to 150).

Both canine and human androgen receptor (AR) signalling are inhibited by overexpression of the dimerized co-chaperone small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein α (SGTA), which is considered to cause the development of androgen-independency. Reduced expression in immortalised cells (REIC/Dkk-3) interferes with SGTA dimerization and rescues AR signalling. This study aimed to assess the effects of REIC/Dkk-3 and SGTA interactions on AR signalling in the canine androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line CHP-1.  Results:   Mammalian two-hybrid and Halo-tagged pull-down assays showed that canine REIC/Dkk-3 interacted with SGTA and interfered with SGTA dimerization. Additionally, reporter assays revealed that canine REIC/Dkk-3 restored AR signalling in both human and canine androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. Therefore, we confirmed the interaction between canine SGTA and REIC/Dkk-3, as well as their role in AR signalling.

The results of the present study revealed that the treatment of morusin induced cell death in various human breast cancer cell lines, but exhibited little effect on normal human breast epithelial cells. In Annexin V-propidium iodide double staining assays, morusin significantly increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in human breast cancer cells. The apoptosis marker proteins cleaved caspase 3 and 9 were consistently upregulated following treatment of cells with morusin in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, morusin was demonstrated to modulate the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Survivin and pro-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2-associated-x protein (Bax) in human breast cancer cells.

The present study was designed to assess the antiproliferative, antiangiogenic and antioxidant effects of MEXA on prostate cancer (PCa) cells (PC-3 and LNCaP).  Methods:   PC-3 and LNCaP cells were cultured and treated with MEXA (10, 50 and 100 μg/mL). The sodium 3'-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were used to evaluate cell viability and cytotoxicity, respectively. DNA fragmentation was determined by cell death detection ELISA plus, and angiogenesis was assessed by chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The antioxidant activities of MEXA were determined by DPPH and hydroxyl (OH) radicals' scavenging methods as well as through the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO) in rats' liver homogenate.  Results:   MEXA at 100, 250 and 500 μg/mL scavenged DPPH by 48%, 62%, 70% and OH radical by 39%, 58%, 67%, respectively. MEXA significantly (p<0.05) inhibited LPO in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, MEXA had antiproliferative effects on PC-3 and LNCaP with IC50 of 62.1 and 73.6 μg/mL, respectively, at 96 h. The LDH assay showed that MEXA had low toxicity in vitro at its IC50 values. The extent of DNA fragmentation by MEXA showed higher values in PC-3 and LNCaP, suggesting the possible induction of apoptosis. In contrast, MEXA did not affect the network of vessels in CAM, thus lacking anti-angiogenic property.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that MEXA induces antiproliferative activity in PCa cells through a mechanism that involves apoptosis.

Increasing evidence suggests that circulating miRNAs in serum and urine may be potential non-invasive biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa). In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether hydrostatic filtration dialysis (HFD) is suitable for urinary EVs (UEVs) isolation and whether such reported PCa-related miRNAs can be detected in UEVs as PCa biomarkers.  Methods:   To analyze EVs miRNAs, we searched for an easy and economic method to enrich EVs from urine samples. We compared the efficiency of HFD method and conventional ultracentrifugation (UC) in isolating UEVs. Subsequently, UEVs were isolated from patients with PCa, patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and healthy individuals. Differential expression of four PCa-related miRNAs (miR-572, miR-1290, miR-141, and miR-145) were measured in UEVs and paired serum EVs using SYBR Green-based quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).  Results:   The overall performance of HFD was similar to UC. In miRNA yield, both HFD and UC can meet the needs of further analysis. The level of miR-145 in UEVs was significantly increased in patients with PCa compared with the patients with BPH (P = 0.018). In addition, significant increase was observed in miR-145 levels when patients with Gleason score ≥8 tumors compared with Gleason score ≤7 (P = 0.020). Receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) revealed that miR-145 in UEVs combined with serum PSA could differentiate PCa from BPH better than PSA alone (AUC 0.863 and AUC 0.805, respectively). In serum EVs, four miRNAs were significantly higher in patients with PCa than with BPH.  Conclusion:   HFD is appropriate for UEVs isolation and miRNA analysis when compared with conventional UC. miR-145 in UEVs is upregulated from PCa patients compared BPH patients and healthy controls.

Furthermore, the association of cancer-specific PYLL with cancer-specific mortality and mean age at diagnosis is explored and the impact of the follow-up window length is examined. The framework of the actuarial relative survival and the Ederer II method is applied to estimate the population background mortality contribution, PYLL*. The fraction (PYLL-PYLL*)/PYLL is then attributed to the cancer. The method is applied to cancer incidence in Belgium 2004-2014, about 631 300 cancer patients. The cancer-specific PYLL divided by the number of cancer patients, mean PYLL, in the Belgian cancer population ranges from 0.4 years for prostate cancer to 15 years for tumours of the central nervous system. The cancer-specific mean PYLL increases with both increasing cancer-specific mortality and decreasing age at diagnosis. Longer follow-up periods yield larger cancer-specific mean PYLL until statistical cure of cancer is achieved.

This study aims to investigate the role of miR-124 in regulating STAT3 expression and proliferation, cycle, apoptosis and invasion of prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   Dual luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated targeted correlation between miR-124 and STAT3. Expression of miR-124, STAT3, p-STAT3, Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 was compared between normal human prostate epithelial cell RWPE-1 and prostate cancer cell DU145. In vitro cultured DU145 cells were treated with miR-124 mimic and/or si-STAT3, to compare expression of STAT3, phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Cyclin D1.

Here we investigated the influence of this pathway on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and tumour vascularisation in hormone resistant prostate and breast cancer models. Immunofluorescent staining of tumour sections from human oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer patients showed a strong correlation between phosphorylated P70S6 kinase (mTOR downstream target), VEGF and SK1 protein expression. In hormone-insensitive prostate (PC3) and breast (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549) cancer cell lines the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) has significantly inhibited SK1 and VEGF expression, while low dose (5 nM) docetaxel had no significant effect.

Herein, we report therapeutic effects of ormeloxifene on prostate cancer and elucidate a novel molecular mechanism of its anticancer activity. Ormeloxifene treatment inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process as evident by repression of N-cadherin, Slug, Snail, vimentin, MMPs (MMP2 and MMP3), β-catenin/TCF-4 transcriptional activity, and induced the expression of pGSK3β. In molecular docking analysis, ormeloxifene showed proficient docking with β-catenin and GSK3β. In addition, ormeloxifene induced apoptosis, inhibited growth and metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells and arrested cell cycle in G0-G1 phase via modulation of cell-cycle regulatory proteins (inhibition of Mcl-1, cyclin D1, and CDK4 and induction of p21 and p27). In functional assays, ormeloxifene remarkably reduced tumorigenic, migratory, and invasive potential of prostate cancer cells. In addition, ormeloxifene treatment significantly (P < 0.01) regressed the prostate tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model while administered through intraperitoneal route (250 μg/mouse, three times a week). These molecular effects of ormeloxifene were also observed in excised tumor tissues as shown by immunohistochemistry analysis. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate repurposing potential of ormeloxifene as an anticancer drug for the treatment of advanced stage metastatic prostate cancer through a novel molecular mechanism involving β-catenin and EMT pathway.

Innovative strategies are required to overcome chemoresistance for improved patient survival. Here, NanoOrl, a new experimental nanoparticle formulation of the FDA-approved drug, orlistat, was investigated for its cytotoxicity in taxane-resistant prostate cancer utilizing two established taxane-resistant (TxR) cell lines. Orlistat is a weight loss drug that inhibits gastric lipases, but is also a potent inhibitor of fatty acid synthase (FASN), which is overexpressed in many types of cancer. NanoOrl was also investigated for its potential to synergize with taxanes in TxR cell lines. Both orlistat and NanoOrl synergistically inhibited cell viability when combined with paclitaxel, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel in PC3-TxR and DU145-TxR cells, yet these combinations were also additive in parental lines. We observed synergistic levels of apoptosis in TxR cells treated with NanoOrl and docetaxel in combination. Mechanistically, the synergy between orlistat and taxanes was independent of effects on the P-glycoprotein multidrug resistance protein, as determined by an efflux activity assay. On the other hand, immunoblot and immunofluorescence staining with an anti-detyrosinated tubulin antibody demonstrated that enhanced microtubule stability was induced by combined NanoOrl and docetaxel treatment in TxR cells. Furthermore, TxR cells exhibited higher lipid synthesis, as demonstrated by 14C-choline incorporation that was abrogated by NanoOrl. These results provide a strong rationale to assess the translational potential of NanoOrl to overcome taxane resistance.

Subgroups of CTCs in 81 patients with prostate cancer (43 castration resistant and 38 untreated localized) were correlated to disease aggressiveness parameters. AUC analysis was applied to compare the performance for metastasis prediction between serum PSA level alone and a combined risk score using both PSA and EMTing CTC count. Circulating megakaryocytes and cancer patient survival association was performed using Cox model.Results: The majority of vimentin (VIM)+/CD45- cells were malignant, with genomic alterations in several genomic regions. The number of cytokeratin (CK)-/VIM+/CD45- CTCs correlated with disease burden, tumor aggressiveness, and poorer survival. Meanwhile, CK+/VIM+/CD45- CTCs were associated with metastases better than other subtypes of CTCs in these limited samples. Combination of PSA level and the number of CK+/VIM+/CD45- CTCs enhanced the prediction of cancer metastases [AUC, 0.921; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.858-0.985]. The number of circulating megakaryocytes was potentially associated with good patient survival in advanced prostate cancer (HR, 0.849; 95% CI, 0.628-1.146, per cell increase), and the difference between the number of mesenchymal CTCs and megakaryocytes strongly correlated to poor survival (HR, 10.17; 95% CI, 2.164-47.789, if score ≥2.0).Conclusions: This CTC analysis approach and the potential association of megakaryocytes with cancer prognosis may greatly enhance our ability to investigate the cancer metastasis process and to predict/monitor cancer progression.

Methods:   Two hundred ninety-five patients with localized prostate cancer were either treated with low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy with I-125 seeds as monotherapy (n = 94; 145Gy), high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy with Ir-192 as a boost to external beam RT (n = 66; 50.4Gy in 1.8Gy fractions EBRT + 18Gy in 9Gy fractions HDR) or EBRT alone (70.2Gy in 1.8Gy fractions; n = 135). ""PSA bounce"" was defined as an increase of at least 0.2 ng/ml followed by spontaneous return to pre-bounce level or lower, biochemical failure was defined according to the Phoenix definition.  Results:   Median follow-up after the end of radiotherapy was 108 months. A PSA bounce showed to be a significant factor for biochemical control (BC) and overall survival (OS) after ten years (BC10 of 83% with bounce vs. 34% without, p < 0.01; OS10 of 82% with bounce vs. 59% without bounce, p < 0.01). The occurrence of a bounce, a high nadir and the therapy modality (LDR-BT vs. EBRT and HDR-BT + EBRT vs. EBRT) proved to be independent factors for PSA recurrence in multivariate Cox regression analysis. A bounce was detected significantly earlier than a PSA recurrence (median 20 months vs. 32 months after RT; p < 0.01; median PSA doubling time 5.5 vs. 5.0 months, not significant). PSA doubling time was prognostically significant in case of PSA recurrence (OS10 of 72% vs. 36% with PSA doubling time ˃ 5 months vs. ≤ 5 months; p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   Rising PSA levels within the first two years can usually be classified as a benign PSA bounce, with favourable recurrence-free and overall survival rates.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying its effect remains unknown. This work found that decreasing TRPM4 levels leads to the reduced proliferation of PC3 cells. This effect was associated with a decrease in total β-catenin protein levels and its nuclear localization, and a significant reduction in Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity. Moreover, TRPM4 silencing increases the Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 β-catenin phosphorylated population and reduces the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9, suggesting an increase in β-catenin degradation as the underlying mechanism. Conversely, TRPM4 overexpression in LNCaP cells increases the Ser9 inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β and the total levels of β-catenin and its nonphosphorylated form. Finally, PC3 cells with reduced levels of TRPM4 showed a decrease in basal and stimulated phosphoactivation of Akt1, which is likely responsible for the decrease in GSK-3β activity in these cells. Our results also suggest that the effect of TRPM4 on Akt1 is probably mediated by an alteration in the calcium/calmodulin-EGFR axis, linking TRPM4 activity with the observed effects in β-catenin-related signaling pathways.

However, persistent Ca2+ release results in mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and consequent apoptosis. Among the three mammalian IP3Rs, IP3R3 appears to be the major player in Ca2+-dependent apoptosis. Here we show that the F-box protein FBXL2 (the receptor subunit of one of 69 human SCF (SKP1, CUL1, F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes) binds IP3R3 and targets it for ubiquitin-, p97- and proteasome-mediated degradation to limit Ca2+ influx into mitochondria. FBXL2-knockdown cells and FBXL2-insensitive IP3R3 mutant knock-in clones display increased cytosolic Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and sensitization to Ca2+-dependent apoptotic stimuli. The phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene is frequently mutated or lost in human tumours and syndromes that predispose individuals to cancer. We found that PTEN competes with FBXL2 for IP3R3 binding, and the FBXL2-dependent degradation of IP3R3 is accelerated in Pten-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts and PTEN-null cancer cells. Reconstitution of PTEN-null cells with either wild-type PTEN or a catalytically dead mutant stabilizes IP3R3 and induces persistent Ca2+ mobilization and apoptosis. IP3R3 and PTEN protein levels directly correlate in human prostate cancer. Both in cell culture and xenograft models, a non-degradable IP3R3 mutant sensitizes tumour cells with low or no PTEN expression to photodynamic therapy, which is based on the ability of photosensitizer drugs to cause Ca2+-dependent cytotoxicity after irradiation with visible light. Similarly, disruption of FBXL2 localization with GGTi-2418, a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, sensitizes xenotransplanted tumours to photodynamic therapy. In summary, we identify a novel molecular mechanism that limits mitochondrial Ca2+ overload to prevent cell death. Notably, we provide proof-of-principle that inhibiting IP3R3 degradation in PTEN-deregulated cancers represents a valid therapeutic strategy.""","""['Shafi Kuchay', 'Carlotta Giorgi', 'Daniele Simoneschi', 'Julia Pagan', 'Sonia Missiroli', 'Anita Saraf', 'Laurence Florens', 'Michael P Washburn', 'Ana Collazo-Lorduy', 'Mireia Castillo-Martin', 'Carlos Cordon-Cardo', 'Said M Sebti', 'Paolo Pinton', 'Michele Pagano']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Tumor suppressive Ca2+ signaling is driven by IP3 receptor fitness.']"""

Recent genomic landscape studies of such cancers have reported recurrent point mutations and focal deletions of another ETS member, the ETS2 repressor factor ERF. Here we show these ERF mutations cause decreased protein stability and mostly occur in tumours without ERG upregulation. ERF loss recapitulates the morphological and phenotypic features of ERG gain in normal mouse prostate cells, including expansion of the androgen receptor transcriptional repertoire, and ERF has tumour suppressor activity in the same genetic background of Pten loss that yields oncogenic activity by ERG. In the more common scenario of ERG upregulation, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing indicates that ERG inhibits the ability of ERF to bind DNA at consensus ETS sites both in normal and in cancerous prostate cells. Consistent with a competition model, ERF overexpression blocks ERG-dependent tumour growth, and ERF loss rescues TMPRSS2-ERG-positive prostate cancer cells from ERG dependency.

Development of hormone-refractory disease is a crucial step for prostate cancer progression for which an effective treatment option is currently unavailable. Therefore, there is a need for new agents that can efficiently target cancer cells, decrease tumor growth, and thereby extend the survival of patients in late-stage castration-resistant prostate cancer. In the current study, a novel heterodinuclear copper(II)Mn(II) Schiff base complex combined with P85 was used to evaluate anticancer activity against prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were evaluated by cell viability, gene, and protein expression assays in vitro. Results showed that the heterodinuclear copper(II)Mn(II) complex-P85 combination decreased cell proliferation by upregulating the apoptotic gene expressions and blocking the cell proliferation-related pathways. Tramp-C1-injected C57/B16 mice were used to mimic a prostate cancer model. Treatment combination of Schiff base complex and P85 significantly enhanced the cellular uptake of chemicals (by blocking the drug transporters and increased life time), suppressed tumor growth, and decreased tumor volume steadily over the course of the experiments. Overall, heterodinuclear copper(II)Mn(II) complex-P85 showed remarkable anticancer activity against prostate cancer in in vitro and in vivo.""","""['Selami Demirci', 'Ayşegül Doğan', 'Neşe Başak Türkmen', 'Dilek Telci', 'Ahmet B Çağlayan', 'Mustafa Ç Beker', 'Ertuğrul Kiliç', 'Ferda Özkan', 'Bülent Dede', 'Fikrettin Şahin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Anticancer activity of Schiff base-Poloxamer P85 combination against kidney cancer.', 'Schiff Base-Poloxamer P85 Combination Prevents Prostate Cancer Progression in C57/Bl6 Mice.', 'Schiff base-Poloxamer P85 combination demonstrates chemotherapeutic effect on prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Induction of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis through oxidative stress in drug-resistant cancer by a newly synthesized Schiff base copper chelate.', 'In vitro anticancer activities of Schiff base and its lanthanum complex.', 'Anticancer activity of Schiff base-Poloxamer P85 combination against kidney cancer.']"""

We compare in a prospective study of Chilean men with suspicion of prostate cancer due to an elevated total serum PSA and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, the use of two on-line nomograms with the detection of primary malignant circulating prostate cells (CPCs) to predict a positive PB for high risk prostate cancer.  Methods:   Consecutive men with suspicion of prostate cancer underwent 12 core TRUS prostate biopsy. Age, total serum PSA and percent free PSA, family history, ethnic origin and prostate ultrasound results were registered. Risk assessment was performed using the online nomograms. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer derived Prostate Risk Indicator (SWOP-PRI) and the North American Prostate Cancer Prevention Trail derived Prostate Risk Indicator (PCPT-CRC) were used to calculate risk of prostate cancer. Immediately before PB an 8 ml blood sample was taken to detect CPCs. Mononuclear cells were obtained by differential gel centrifugation and identified using double immunomarcation with anti-PSA and anti- P504S. Biopsies were classified as cancer/no-cancer, CPC detection test as negative/positive and the total number of cells/8ml registered. Areas under the curve (AUC) for total serum PSA, free percent, PSA, SWOP-PRI, PCPT-CRC and CPCs were calculated and compared. Diagnostic yields were calculated, including the number of possible biopsies that could be avoided and the number of clinically significant cancers that would be missed.  Results:   1,223 men aged 〉 55 years were analyzed, 467 (38.2%) had a biopsy positive for cancer of which 114/467 (24.45) complied with the criteria for active observation; 177/467 (36.8%) were Gleason 7 or higher. Discriminative power of detecting prostate cancer, showed areas under the curve of total PSA 0.559, SWOP nomogram 0.687, PCPTRC nomogram 0.716, free percent PSA 0.765 and CPC detection 0.844. CPC detection was superior to the other models (p〈0.0001). Using the recommended cutoff values, free percent PSA avoided 81% of biopsies missing 58% of significant cancers; for the other models the values were SWOP 75% and 56%; PCPTRC 61% and 62%, CPC detection 57% and 4% respectively.  Conclusions:   CPC detection was superior to the other models in predicting the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer at initial biopsy; potentially reduces the number of unnecessary biopsy while missing few significant cancers. Being a positive/negative test it avoids defining a cutoff value which may differ between populations.

Methods:   Forty-eight patients with a PSA recurrence after RP who underwent multimodality imaging were evaluated. Demographic data, postoperative PSA levels, and imaging studies performed at those levels were evaluated.  Results:   Eight (21%) MRIs, 6 (33%) CTs, and 4 (9%) bone scans had PCa-specific findings.

Patients were randomized and allocated to two groups, including 60 to the combination group (tamsulosin 0.2 mg/day and trospium chloride 20 mg twice daily) and 64 to the monotherapy group (tamsulosin 0.2 mg/day). Treatment began 1 day after brachytherapy and continued for 6 months.

A log-linear relationship was demonstrated (r2 = 0.77) between baseline measurements of 18F-fluoride uptake prior to 223Ra-dichloride therapy and changes in uptake 12 weeks after the first cycle of therapy. Correlations were also observed between both 223Ra and 18F-fluoride uptake in lesions (r = 0.75) as well as between 223Ra absorbed dose and 18F-fluoride uptake (r = 0.96).  Conclusions:   There is both inter-patient and intra-patient heterogeneity of absorbed dose estimates to metastatic lesions. A relationship between 223Ra lesion absorbed dose and subsequent lesion response was observed. Analysis of this small group of patients suggests that baseline uptake of 18F-fluoride in bone metastases is significantly correlated with corresponding uptake of 223Ra, the associated 223Ra absorbed dose and subsequent lesion response to treatment.""","""['Iain Murray', 'Sarah J Chittenden', 'Ana M Denis-Bacelar', 'Cecilia Hindorf', 'Christopher C Parker', 'Sue Chua', 'Glenn D Flux']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['On the 18F-fluoride PET imaging quantification to predict 223Ra-dichloride treatment response.', 'Uptake of Radium-223 Dichloride and Early 18FNaF PET Response Are Driven by Baseline 18FNaF Parameters: a Pilot Study in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Dosimetry of bone metastases in targeted radionuclide therapy with alpha-emitting (223)Ra-dichloride.', 'A Phase 1, Open-Label Study of the Biodistribution, Pharmacokinetics, and Dosimetry of 223Ra-Dichloride in Patients with Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer and Skeletal Metastases.', 'Evaluating radium-223 response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with imaging.', 'Radium-223 dichloride: a novel treatment option for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'A Projection-Domain Low-Count Quantitative SPECT Method for α-Particle-Emitting Radiopharmaceutical Therapy.', 'Real-world effectiveness, long-term safety and treatment pathway integration of radium-223 therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A Primer on Radiopharmaceutical Therapy.', 'Plasma Circulating Tumor Epstein-Barr Virus for the Surveillance of Cancer Progression in Bone-Only Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.', 'Joint EANM, SNMMI and IAEA enabling guide: how to set up a theranostics centre.']"""

The GR and the AR are central regulators of various metabolic, homeostatic and differentiation processes and hence important therapeutic targets, especially in inflammation and prostate cancer, respectively. Hormone binding to these steroid receptors (SRs) leads to DNA binding and activation or repression of their target genes with the aid of interacting proteins, coregulators. However, protein interactomes of these important drug targets have remained poorly defined. We used proximity-dependent biotin identification to map the protein interaction landscapes of GR and AR in the presence and absence of their cognate agonist (dexamethasone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone) and antagonist (RU486, enzalutamide) in intact human cells. We reproducibly identified more than 30 proteins that interacted with the GR in an agonist-specific manner and whose interactions were significantly influenced by the DNA-binding function of the receptor. Interestingly, the agonist-dependent interactome of the GR overlapped considerably with that of the AR. In addition to known coactivators, corepressors and components of BAF (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complex, we identified a number of proteins, including lysine methyltransferases and demethylases that have not been previously linked to glucocorticoid or androgen signaling. A substantial number of these novel agonist-dependent GR/AR-interacting proteins, e.g. BCOR, IRF2BP2, RCOR1, and TLE3, have previously been implicated in transcription repression. This together with our data on the effect of BCOR, IRF2BP2, and RCOR1 on GR target gene expression suggests multifaceted functions and roles for SR coregulators.

Subjects and methods:   The study group included 151 men (mean age, 68.1 ± 7.4 [SD] years; range, 50-83 years) undergoing active surveillance with 3D whole prostate, zonal, and tumor volumetric findings documented at endorectal MRI examinations performed at two time points (median interval, 1.9 years). Tumor (location confirmed at transrectal ultrasound or template biopsy) ADC was measured on the slice with the largest lesion. Twenty randomly selected patients had the measurements repeated by the same observer after a greater than 4-month interval, and the limits of agreement of measurements were calculated. Tumor volume increases greater than the upper limit of agreement were designated measurable growth, and their baseline ADCs and change in ADC were compared with those of tumors without measurable growth (independent-samples t test).  Results:   Fifty-two (34.4%) tumors increased measurably in volume. Baseline ADC and tumor volume were negatively correlated (r = -0.42, p = 0.001). Baseline ADC values did not differ between those with and those without measurable growth (p = 0.06), but change in ADC was significantly different (-6.8% ± 12.3% for those with measurable growth vs 0.23% ± 10.1% for those without, p = 0.0005). Percentage change in tumor volume and percentage change in ADC were negatively correlated (r = -0.31, p = 0.0001). A 5.8% reduction in ADC indicated a measurable increase in tumor volume with 54.9% sensitivity and 77.0% specificity (AUC, 0.67).  Conclusion:   Tumor volume increased measurably in 34.4% of men after 2 years of active surveillance.

Clinical studies of PD-1 blockade are only now being initiated in pediatric patients, and little is known regarding programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in common childhood cancers. The authors characterized PD-L1 expression and tumor-associated immune cells (TAICs) (lymphocytes and macrophages) in common pediatric cancers.  Methods:   Whole slide sections and tissue microarrays were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 expression and for the presence of TAICs. TAICs were also screened for PD-L1 expression.  Results:   Thirty-nine of 451 evaluable tumors (9%) expressed PD-L1 in at least 1% of tumor cells. The highest frequency histotypes comprised Burkitt lymphoma (80%; 8 of 10 tumors), glioblastoma multiforme (36%; 5 of 14 tumors), and neuroblastoma (14%; 17 of 118 tumors). PD-L1 staining was associated with inferior survival among patients with neuroblastoma (P = .004). Seventy-four percent of tumors contained lymphocytes and/or macrophages.

Conclusions:   A subset of diagnostic pediatric cancers exhibit PD-L1 expression, whereas a much larger fraction demonstrates infiltration with tumor-associated lymphocytes. PD-L1 expression may be a biomarker for poor outcome in neuroblastoma.

It is unknown whether BRCA2-associated prostate cancer responds favorably to such treatment.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of a single-institution cohort of men with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer was performed to determine the association between carrier status of pathogenic BRCA2 germline variants and prostate-specific antigen response to carboplatin-based chemotherapy. From 2001 through 2015, 8081 adult men with prostate cancer who had a consultation and/or underwent treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute provided blood samples and consented to analyses of biologic material and clinical records. A subgroup of 141 men received at least 2 doses of carboplatin and docetaxel for castration-resistant disease (94% were also taxane refractory). These patients were categorized according to the absence or presence of pathogenic germline mutations in BRCA2 based on DNA sequencing from whole blood. The primary outcome was the response rate to carboplatin/docetaxel chemotherapy, defined according to a decline in prostate-specific antigen that exceeded 50% within 12 weeks of initiating this regimen. Associations between BRCA2 mutation status and response to carboplatin-based chemotherapy were tested using the Fisher exact test, with a 2-sided P value < .05 as the threshold for significance.  Results:   Pathogenic germline BRCA2 variants were observed in 8 of 141 men (5.7%; 95% confidence interval, 2.5%-10.9%). Six of 8 BRCA2 carriers (75%) experienced prostate-specific antigen declines >50% within 12 weeks, compared with 23 of 133 noncarriers (17%; absolute difference, 58%; 95% confidence interval, 27%-88%; P < .001). Prostate cancer cell lines functionally corroborated these clinical findings.

In practice, the discreteness of the data obtained under such circumstances is plainly ignored both in data analysis and in sample size planning of survival time studies. As a framework for analyzing the impact of making no difference between continuous and discrete recording of failure times, we use a scenario in which the partially observed times are assigned to the points of the grid of inspection times in the natural way. Evaluating the treatment effect in a two-arm trial fitting into this framework by means of ordinary methods based on Cox's relative risk model is shown to produce biased estimates and/or confidence bounds whose actual coverage exhibits marked discrepancies from the nominal confidence level. Not surprisingly, the amount of these distorting effects turns out to be the larger the coarser the grid of inspection times has been chosen. As a promising approach to correctly analyzing and planning studies generating discretely recorded failure times, we use large-sample likelihood theory for parametric models accommodating the key features of the scenario under consideration.

Methods:   Retrospective analysis was performed for 30 men who underwent simultaneous PSMA PET-MR imaging for staging of prostate cancer. Thirty texture features were derived from each manually contoured T2-weighted, transaxial, prostatic TZ using texture analysis software that applies a spatial band-pass filter and quantifies texture through histogram analysis. Texture features of the TZ were compared to PSMA expression on the corresponding PET images. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction controlled the false discovery rate at <5%.  Results:   Eighty-eight T2-weighted images in 18 patients demonstrated abnormal PSMA expression within the TZ on PET-MR. 123 images were PSMA negative. Based on the corrected p-value of 0.005, significant differences between PSMA positive and negative slices were found for 16 texture parameters: Standard deviation and mean of positive pixels for all spatial filters (p = <0.0001 for both at all spatial scaling factor (SSF) values) and mean intensity following filtration for SSF 3-6 mm (p = 0.0002-0.0018).  Conclusion:   Abnormal expression of PSMA within the TZ is associated with altered texture on T2-weighted MR, providing validation of MRTA for the detection of TZ prostate cancer.  Key points:   • Prostate transition zone (TZ) MR texture analysis may assist in prostate cancer detection. • Abnormal transition zone PSMA expression correlates with altered texture on T2-weighted MR. • TZ with abnormal PSMA expression demonstrates significantly reduced MI, SD and MPP.""","""['Anthony Bates', 'Kenneth Miles']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Comparison between 18 F-DCFPyL PET and MRI for the detection of transition zone prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative characterisation of clinically significant intra-prostatic cancer by prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression and cell density on PSMA-11.', 'Comparison between pelvic PSMA-PET/MR and whole-body PSMA-PET/CT for the initial evaluation of prostate cancer: a proof of concept study.', 'Integration of PSMA-targeted PET imaging into the armamentarium for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Current use of PSMA-PET in prostate cancer management.', 'Quantifying Tumor Heterogeneity from Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Prostate Using Texture Analysis.', 'Decision-support for treatment with 177Lu-PSMA: machine learning predicts response with high accuracy based on PSMA-PET/CT and clinical parameters.', 'PET/MRI in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Machine Learning Facilitates Hotspot Classification in PSMA-PET/CT with Nuclear Medicine Specialist Accuracy.', 'Intraindividual comparison between 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and mpMRI for intraprostatic tumor delineation in patients with primary prostate cancer: a retrospective analysis in 101 patients.']"""

Methods:   The present study includes all men (n=518) who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for clinically localised PCa, 29 of whom had N1 disease. Soluble uPAR forms were measured using three time-resolved fluorescence immunoassays. The prognostic value of the different uPAR forms together with clinicopathological parameters for N1 disease were analysed using logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) regression analysis and quantified using the areas under the ROC curve (AUC).  Results:   All soluble uPAR levels were significantly (p=0.03) higher in patients with N1 disease compared with patients with N0/x disease.

Because of its high incidence and oncogenic role, ERG and components of ERG network have emerged as potential drug targets for prostate cancer. Utilizing gene expression datasets, from matched normal and prostate tumor epithelial cells, an association of NOTCH transcription factors with ERG expression status was identified, confirming that NOTCH factors are direct transcriptional targets of ERG. Inhibition of ERG in TMPRSS2-ERG-positive VCaP cells led to decreased levels of NOTCH1 and 2 proteins and downstream transcriptional targets and partially recapitulated the phenotypes associated with ERG inhibition. Regulation of NOTCH1 and 2 genes by ERG were also noted with ectopic ERG expression in LNCaP (ERG-negative prostate cancer) and RWPE-1 (benign prostate-derived immortalized) cells. Furthermore, inhibition of NOTCH by the small-molecule γ-secretase inhibitor 1, GSI-1, conferred an increased sensitivity to androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors (bicalutamide and enzalutamide) or the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor (abiraterone) in VCaP cells. Combined treatment with bicalutamide and GSI-1 showed strongest inhibition of AR, ERG, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and PSA protein levels along with decreased cell growth, cell survival, and enhanced apoptosis. Intriguingly, this effect was not observed in ERG-negative prostate cancer cells or immortalized benign/normal prostate epithelial cells. These data underscore the synergy of AR and NOTCH inhibitors in reducing the growth of ERG-positive prostate cancer cells.Implications: Combinational targeting of NOTCH and AR signaling has therapeutic potential in advanced ERG-driven prostate cancers.

We evaluated the effect of low-dose steroids on NLR in men suffering from castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Patients and methods:   The NLR was evaluated in a prospective randomized phase II trial that compared prednisolone 5 mg twice daily and dexamethasone 0.5 mg daily administered to 75 chemotherapy and abiraterone/enzalutamide-naive CRPC patients. NLR was examined at baseline (BL), after 6 and 12 weeks of corticosteroid treatment; associations with >50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, duration of response (PSA progression-free interval), and overall survival (OS) were tested using logistic regression and Cox regression analysis.  Results:   The median NLR for all evaluable patients was 2.6 at BL; 2.9 at 6 weeks; and 4.0 at 12 weeks. After low-dose corticosteroid initiation, 46 patients had a decline in PSA with 24 confirmed responders. BL NLR (log10) associated with a PSA response (odds ratio, .029, 95% confidence interval [CI], .002-.493; P = .014), and with the extent of the PSA decline (P = .009). A favorable BL NLR (less than median) associated with a 5.5-fold higher odds of a PSA >50% response (95% CI, 1.3-23.9; P = .02). Higher BL NLR (log10) associated with a shorter time to PSA progression (hazard ratio [HR], 9.5; 95% CI, 2.3-39.9; P = .002). In multivariate analysis BL NLR as a discrete variable was independently associated with PSA progression (HR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-8.1; P = .003). NLR at 6 weeks was also associated with duration of benefit; in the favorable NLR category time to PSA progression was 10.8 months, for those who converted to an unfavorable (greater than median) category 4.5 months, and for those remaining in a unfavorable category only 1.5 months (95% CI, 0.5-2.5; P = .003). OS was 33.1 months (95% CI, 24.2-42.0) and 21.9 months (95% CI, 19.3-24.4) for those with an favorable and unfavorable BL NLR, respectively.

Objective:   We hypothesized that subjects with PIDD would have an increased incidence of cancer due to impaired immune function.  Methods:   Overall and site-specific cancer incidence rates were evaluated in subjects with PIDD (n = 3658) enrolled in the USIDNET registry from 2003 to 2015 and compared with age-adjusted incidence rates in the SEER database.  Results:   We observed a 1.42-fold excess relative risk of cancer in subjects with PIDD compared with the age-adjusted SEER population (P < .001).

Methods: From February 2012 to September 2014, 120 PCa patients confirmed by biopsy at the Department of Urology Surgery, Beijing Shijitan Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University, were included. They were divided into high-, moderate- and low-risk groups according to EAU Guidelines in 2015. All patients received intermittent endocrine therapy. When the serum level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) dropped to 0.2 μg/L, the medication was not discontinued until 3 months later for the observation group; however, the medication was immediately discontinued after reaching the above-mentioned threshold for the control group. When the PSA level during the period of medication discontinuance increased to 4 μg/L, another course of intermittent endocrine therapy was administered until the occurrence of the failure event. The Cox proportional regression model was used to compare the difference between the two groups in the androgen-independent signs, progression of PCa and severe adverse events. Result: After correction for multiple confounding factors, including severity grading before treatment, average duration of medication, average duration of medication discontinuance and the number of courses of therapy, it was found that the medication scheme adopted in the observation group was a protective factor against androgen-independent signs in the high-risk PCa patients (HR: 0.535, 95% CI: 0.458-0.612; P<0.001); it was also a protective factor against disease progression for the high- and moderate-risk patients (high-risk group, HR: 0.387, 95% CI: 0.297-0.477; P<0.001; moderate-risk group, HR: 0.697, 95% CI: 0.581-0.813; P<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of severe adverse events among PCa patients treated by different medication schemes (HR: 1.003, 95% CI: 0.906-1.100; P=0.798). The medication scheme adopted in the observation group was an independent risk factor for severe adverse events in the low-risk PCa patients (HR: 1.489, 95% CI: 1.305-1.673; P<0.001). Conclusion: As compared with the scheme of immediately discontinuing the medication after reaching the indicator threshold, maintenance medication for another 3 months was beneficial for the high- and moderate-risk PCa cases. The maintenance medication could reduce the androgen-independent signs and disease progression, without increasing the risk of severe adverse events. However, for the low-risk patients, there was no major difference between the two medication schemes, immediate discontinuance and maintenance medication for another 3 months. Instead, further medication may bring about a higher risk of severe adverse events.""","""['D Chen', 'M Xia']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi""","""['Intermittent hormonal therapy in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer: a randomized trial.', 'Clinical study on intermittent hormonal therapy for patients with prostate cancer.', 'Hormonal therapy for prostate cancer: methods and prognosis.', 'Intermittent vs Continuous Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Initial hormonal management of androgen-sensitive metastatic, recurrent, or progressive prostate cancer: 2006 update of an American Society of Clinical Oncology practice guideline.']"""

CYT997 is a novel microtubule-disrupting agent with anticancer activity in multiple cancer types including prostate cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of action of CYT997 in prostate cancer have not been well characterized.  Methods:   Src knockdown cells were achieved by lentiviral-mediated interference. The drug effects on cell proliferation were measured by MTS. The drug effects on cell viability and death were determined by Cell Titer-Glo® Luminescent cell viability kit and flow cytometry with Zombie Aqua™ staining. The drug effects on apoptosis were assessed by Cell Death Detection Elisa kit and Western blot with a cleaved PARP antibody. The drug effects on cell invasion were examined by Matrigel-coated Boyden chambers. Oxidative stress was detected by DCFH-DA staining and electrochemical biosensor. Mouse models generated by subcutaneous or intracardiac injection were used to investigate the in vivo drug efficacy in tumor growth and metastasis.  Results:   CYT997 effectively inhibited proliferation, survival, and invasion of prostate cancer cells via blocking multiple oncogenic signaling cascades but not the Src pathway. Inhibition of Src expression by small hairpin RNA or inactivation of Src by dasatinib increased the CYT997-induced cytotoxicity of in vitro. Moreover, the combination of dasatinib and CYT997 exhibited a superior inhibitory effect on tumor growth and metastasis compared with either of the drugs alone.  Conclusion:   Our findings demonstrate that blockage of Src augments the anticancer effect of CYT997 on prostate cancer and suggest that co-treatment of dasatinib and CYT997 may represent an effective therapeutic regimen for limiting prostate cancer.""","""['Yong Teng', 'Yafei Cai', 'Wenhu Pi', 'Lixia Gao', 'Chloe Shay']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Hematol Oncol""","""['Combined targeting of Arf1 and Ras potentiates anticancer activity for prostate cancer therapeutics.', 'Impact of the SRC inhibitor dasatinib on the metastatic phenotype of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Abrogation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 reactivation after Src kinase inhibition results in synergistic antitumor effects.', 'Inhibition of SRC family kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases by dasatinib: possible combinations in solid tumors.', 'The role of Src in prostate cancer.', 'FGF19/FGFR4 signaling axis confines and switches the role of melatonin in head and neck cancer metastasis.', 'Targeting the Extra-Cellular Matrix-Tumor Cell Crosstalk for Anti-Cancer Therapy: Emerging Alternatives to Integrin Inhibitors.', 'Mitochondrial ROS accumulation inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 pathway is a critical modulator of CYT997-induced autophagy and apoptosis in gastric cancer.', 'Src Family Kinases as Therapeutic Targets in Advanced Solid Tumors: What We Have Learned so Far.', 'Lipoxin A4 Ameliorates Acute Pancreatitis-Associated Acute Lung Injury through the Antioxidative and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of the Nrf2 Pathway.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and to identify parameters predicting outcome in mCRPC patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617.  Methods:   Between December 2014 and January 2017, 59 consecutive patients (median age 72 years; interquartile range, (IQR, 66-76 years) with mCRPC, who had been treated with at least one next-generation antihormonal drug as well as chemotherapy, were included in this study. Biochemical response was evaluated using Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression proportional hazards model. Toxicity was assessed using Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The study was approved by the local ethics committee.  Results:   The 59 patients were treated with a total of 159 cycles (median 3 cycles, range 1-7) of 177Lu-PSMA-617 (median dose 6.11 GBq, IQR 5.9-6.3 GBq). The median follow-up was 24 weeks (IQR 15-36 weeks). Follow-up data for at least 12 weeks (PCWG3) were available in 76% (45) of the patients. For outcome results data from all patients treated with at least one cycle were analysed. A decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of ≥50% occurred in 53%, and a decline in PSA of any amount in 91% of patients. The estimated median OS was 32 weeks. An initial alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level <220 U/L and a PSA decline after the first cycle were associated with a longer OS (56 vs. 28 weeks, p < 0.01, and 56 vs. 29 weeks, p = 0.04, respectively). The median estimated PSA progression-free survival (PPFS) was 18 weeks. Only ALP level <220 U/L was significantly associated with a longer PPFS (41 vs. 18 weeks, p < 0.01).

The functions of miR-511-3p upregulation in regulating in vitro cancer proliferation, migration and in vivo cancer growth were assessed by MTT, transwell and transplantation assays, respectively. Downstream target gene of miR-511-3p, AKT3, was verified by dual-luciferase activity and qPCR assays.

Results:   MiR-511-3p is significantly downregulated in CaP cell lines, and human CaP tumors. MiR-511-3p was further downregulated in T3/T4-staged CaP tumors and closely correlated with shorter overall survival among CaP patients.

Methods:   Prostate-specific membrane antigen-HBED PET/CT scans of 100 consecutive patients were analysed. Coeliac and stellate ganglia were identified by their anatomical location. PSMA-HBED uptake in these ganglia was recorded as either present or absent. If present, the SUVmax value for each ganglion was measured and compared to SUVmax of mediastinal blood pool.  Results:   Of the 100 patients, 45 had PSMA-HBED uptake in the right coeliac ganglion and 81 had PSMA-HBED uptake in the left coeliac ganglion. The mean SUVmax for the right coeliac ganglion was 2.6 (range 1.2-4.0) and for the left, 2.7 (range 1.2-6.5). An SUVmax 1.5 times greater than that of mediastinal blood pool activity was found in 25 of right and 47 of left coeliac ganglia. Stellate ganglion uptake of PSMA-HBED was identified in 54 of right and 74 of left stellate ganglia. The mean SUVmax for the right and left stellate ganglia were 2.2 (range 1.6-3.6) and 2.4 (range 1.4-4.2) respectively. An SUVmax 1.5 times greater than that of mediastinal blood pool activity was found in 12 of right and 32 of left coeliac ganglia.

Renal excretion of 68 Ga-PSMA can lead to difficulties in scan interpretation, particularly in the pelvis. We evaluated if intravenous Frusemide at the time of 68 Ga-PSMA injection reduces excreted activity artefact and improves diagnostic certainty.  Methods:   Sixty-two men with prostate cancer undergoing clinically indicated 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT were prospectively included, 30 men receiving Frusemide at the time of radiotracer injection. Clinical information and reasons for the scan were documented. Intensity of excreted activity was assessed semi quantitatively for each patient (SUV max). PET/CT images were interpreted by two experienced readers for image quality, and presence/absence of PSMA-positive disease.  Results:   Twenty-nine percent (18/62) were staging scans, and 71% (44/62) re-staging. PSMA-positive findings were identified in 95% (59/62). Staging scans had PSMA-positive findings within the prostate in 100% (18/18) and re-staging scans, 50% (22/44) in the prostate fossa, 64% (28/44) in lymph nodes and 21% (9/44) in viscera and bone. Administration of Frusemide had a significant impact on intensity of excreted activity in the ureters and bladder. Impaired image quality was noted in 33% (10/30) of men not given Frusemide, compared to only 3% (1/32) in men given Frusemide (P = 0.002). Reporter confidence on the presence/absence of PSMA avid disease in the prostate fossa improved from 63% (19/30) without Frusemide, to 91% (29/32) with Frusemide (P < 0.015).  Conclusion:   Intravenous Frusemide given with 68 Ga-PSMA reduces excretion artefact, and improves diagnostic certainty.

Methods:   Prospectively collected toxicity data were retrospectively reviewed for 293 men who underwent 64-66 Gy IG-IMRT to the prostate bed between 2007 and 2015.  Results:   Median follow-up after PPRT was 39 months. Baseline grade ≥2 genitourinary (GU), gastrointestinal (GI) and sexual toxicities were 20.5%, 2.7% and 43.7%, respectively, reflecting ongoing toxicity after radical prostatectomy. Incidence of new (compared to baseline) acute grade ≥2 GU and GI toxicity was 5.8% and 10.6%, respectively. New late grade ≥2 GU, GI and sexual toxicity occurred in 19.1%, 4.7% and 20.2%, respectively. However, many patients also experienced improvements in toxicities. For this reason, prevalence of grade ≥2 GU, GI and sexual toxicities 4 years after PPRT was similar to or lower than baseline (21.7%, 2.6% and 17.4%, respectively). There were no grade ≥4 toxicities.  Conclusions:   Post-prostatectomy IG-IMRT using Australian contouring guidelines appears to have tolerable acute and late toxicity. The 4-year prevalence of grade ≥2 GU and GI toxicity was virtually unchanged compared to baseline, and sexual toxicity improved over baseline. This should reassure radiation oncologists following these guidelines. Late toxicity rates of surgery and PPRT are higher than following definitive IG-IMRT, and this should be taken into account if patients are considering surgery and likely to require PPRT.""","""['Stephen Chin', 'Noel J Aherne', 'Andrew Last', 'Hassan Assareh', 'Thomas P Shakespeare']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Late Side Effects After Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Compared to 3D-Conformal Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Results From 2 Prospective Cohorts.', 'Improved toxicity profile following high-dose postprostatectomy salvage radiation therapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy to the Prostate Bed With Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT): A Phase 2 Trial.', 'Hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer in the postoperative setting: What is the evidence so far?', 'Whole pelvic intensity-modulated radiotherapy for gynecological malignancies: A review of the literature.', 'Bone health assessment with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in men with high-risk prostate carcinoma commencing adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

The Cu(II) complexes were tested for their aqueous stability, and for their interaction with biological molecules, namely DNA and HSA (human serum albumin), through fluorescence quenching experiments (and electrophoresis for DNA). With the exception of C3, all the synthesized complexes were able to interact with DNA and HSA. Their cytotoxic activity against two cancer cell lines (MCF7 - breast and PC3 - prostate) was also evaluated. Complexes C5 and C6, with larger aromatic systems, showed much higher cytotoxicity (in the low μM range), than C1-C4, as well as IC50 values much lower than cisplatin. For C6 the results suggest that the mechanisms of cell death do not seem to be mediated by apoptosis, through caspases 3/7 activation, but by involving membrane potential and imbalance in physiological elements such as P, K and Ca.""","""['Nádia Ribeiro', 'Somnath Roy', 'Nataliya Butenko', 'Isabel Cavaco', 'Teresa Pinheiro', 'Irina Alho', 'Fernanda Marques', 'Fernando Avecilla', 'João Costa Pessoa', 'Isabel Correia']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Inorg Biochem""","""['Copper complexes based on chiral Schiff-base ligands: DNA/BSA binding ability, DNA cleavage activity, cytotoxicity and mechanism of apoptosis.', 'Cu(II), Ni(II) complexes derived from chiral Schiff-base ligands: Synthesis, characterization, cytotoxicity, protein and DNA-binding properties.', 'Mixed-ligand copper(ii) Schiff base complexes: the role of the co-ligand in DNA binding, DNA cleavage, protein binding and cytotoxicity.', 'Transition Metal Complexes with Tridentate Schiff Bases (O\u2009N\u2009O and O\u2009N\u2009N) Derived from Salicylaldehyde: An Analysis of Their Potential Anticancer Activity.', 'Schiff bases: a short survey on an evergreen chemistry tool.', 'Research Progress on the Biological Activities of Metal Complexes Bearing Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrazones.', 'Tuning the Biological Activity of Camphorimine Complexes through Metal Selection.', 'Copper(ii) complexes with terpene derivatives of ethylenediamine: synthesis, and antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant activity.', 'Aminothiazole-Linked Metal Chelates: Synthesis, Density Functional Theory, and Antimicrobial Studies with Antioxidant Correlations.', 'Synthesis, DFT Calculations, Antiproliferative, Bactericidal Activity and Molecular Docking of Novel Mixed-Ligand Salen/8-Hydroxyquinoline Metal Complexes.']"""

Methods:   In 2005, we defined an institutional AS protocol (Sorveglianza Attiva Istituto Nazionale Tumori [SAINT]), and we joined the Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) study in 2007. Eligibility criteria included clinical stage ≤T2a, initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng/mL, and Gleason Pattern Score (GPS) ≤3 + 3 (both protocols); ≤25% positive cores with a maximum core length containing cancer ≤50% (SAINT); and ≤2 positive cores and PSA density <0.2 ng/mL/cm3 (PRIAS). Switching to active treatment was advised for a worsening of GPS, increased positive cores, or PSA doubling time <3 years. Active treatment-free survival (ATFS) was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors associated with ATFS were evaluated with a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   A total of 818 patients were included: 200 in SAINT, 530 in PRIAS, and 88 in personalized AS monitoring. Active treatment-free survival was 50% after a median follow-up of 60 months. A total of 404/818 patients (49.4%) discontinued AS: 274 for biopsy-related reclassification, 121/404 (30%) for off-protocol reasons, 9/404 (2.2%) because of anxiety. Biopsy reclassification was associated with PSA density (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8), maximum percentage of core involvement (HR 1.5), positive cores at diagnostic biopsy (HR 1.6), older age (HR 1.5), and prostate volume (HR 0.6) (all p<0.01). Patients from SAINT were significantly more likely to discontinue AS than were the patients from PRIAS (HR 1.65, p<0.0001).  Conclusions:   Five years after diagnosis, 50% of patients with early PCa were spared from active treatment. Wide inclusion criteria are associated with lower ATFS.

The aim of this study was to perform a cultural adaptation for the tool to be used in a population of Italian men on active surveillance (AS).  Methods:   A total of 222 patients with localized PCa who were recruited for the Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) protocol completed the MAX-PC. Psychometric analysis was performed to assess reliability indexes. A Spearman rank correlation was used to test the association between MAX-PC scales and other questionnaires and was used for longitudinal analysis.  Results:   Cronbach coefficients and item to total correlation demonstrated good internal consistency. Some items related to the repetition of the PSA test showed a large floor effect and thus were poorly effective in measuring anxiety for PSA testing in patients on AS. Confirmatory factor analysis partly failed to reproduce the structure of the original version. A modified version of MAX-PC, excluding the items with a large floor effect, was thus considered for AS patients. Factor analysis on this version demonstrated considerable consistency with the presence of 3 subscales: anxiety related to PCa, anxiety related to PSA testing, and anxiety related to the fear of tumor progression. Longitudinal analysis showed an acceptable validity over time. The MAX-PC was correlated with the anxious preoccupation subscale of the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale.

Although the prevalence of germline mutations in DNA-repair genes among men with localized prostate cancer who are unselected for family predisposition is insufficient to warrant routine testing, the frequency of such mutations in patients with metastatic prostate cancer has not been established.  Methods:   We recruited 692 men with documented metastatic prostate cancer who were unselected for family history of cancer or age at diagnosis. We isolated germline DNA and used multiplex sequencing assays to assess mutations in 20 DNA-repair genes associated with autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition syndromes.  Results:   A total of 84 germline DNA-repair gene mutations that were presumed to be deleterious were identified in 82 men (11.8%); mutations were found in 16 genes, including BRCA2 (37 men [5.3%]), ATM (11 [1.6%]), CHEK2 (10 [1.9% of 534 men with data]), BRCA1 (6 [0.9%]), RAD51D (3 [0.4%]), and PALB2 (3 [0.4%]). Mutation frequencies did not differ according to whether a family history of prostate cancer was present or according to age at diagnosis. Overall, the frequency of germline mutations in DNA-repair genes among men with metastatic prostate cancer significantly exceeded the prevalence of 4.6% among 499 men with localized prostate cancer (P<0.001), including men with high-risk disease, and the prevalence of 2.7% in the Exome Aggregation Consortium, which includes 53,105 persons without a known cancer diagnosis (P<0.001).  Conclusions:   In our multicenter study, the incidence of germline mutations in genes mediating DNA-repair processes among men with metastatic prostate cancer was 11.8%, which was significantly higher than the incidence among men with localized prostate cancer.

Objective:   To develop a model to predict cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and to test the impact of radiotherapy (RT) on survival in this setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified 496 patients treated with RP and lymph node dissection at two referral centers between 1994 and 2014 who had PSA persistence, defined as a PSA level between 0.1 and 2 ng/ml at 6-8 wk after RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   A multivariable model predicting CSM was developed. We assessed whether the impact of postoperative PSA levels on survival differed according to baseline CSM risk. The nonparametric curve fitting method was then used to explore the relationship between baseline CSM risk and 10-yr CSM rates according to postoperative RT.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up for survivors was 110 mo. Overall, 49 patients experienced CSM. The 10-yr CSM-free survival was 88%. Pathologic grade group and pathologic stage were independent predictors of CSM (all p=0.01). The association between CSM-free survival and PSA at 6-8 wk differed by the baseline CSM risk, whereby the effect of increasing PSA was evident only in patients with a CSM risk of ≥10%. Postoperative RT was beneficial when the predicted risk of CSM was ≥30% (p=0.001 by an interaction test). Our study is limited by its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   Increasing PSA levels should be considered as predictors of mortality exclusively in men with worse pathologic characteristics. Postoperative RT in this setting was associated with a survival benefit in patients with a CSM risk of ≥30%. Conversely, individuals with a CSM risk of <30% should be initially managed expectantly.  Patient summary:   Not all patients with prostate-specific antigen persistence have a poor prognosis. Pathologic characteristics should be used to estimate the risk of cancer-specific mortality in these individuals and to identify patients who could benefit from postoperative radiotherapy.""","""['Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'William P Parker', 'Emanuele Zaffuto', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Marco Bandini', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Balancing Risks in Prostate-specific Antigen Recurrence: The Fox Versus the Hedgehog.', 'Re: Giorgio Gandaglia, Stephen A.

An understanding of the tight interaction between immunity and progression of cancer can provide novel treatment options for different malignancies including prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we have shown that AATF genome encoded miR-2909, known to play role both in immunity and cancer upregulates various interferon stimulating genes (ISGs) including ISGylation system through STAT1. Our results revealed that miR-2909 up-regulates STAT1 through negative regulation of SOCS3 and not through up-regulation of Type 1 interferon (IFN) production. It was observed that inhibition of ISGylation reduced the proliferation potential of PCa cells. Furthermore, androgens were found to negatively regulate ISGylation in LNCaP cells through androgen receptor signalling independently of miR-2909. TGF-β mediated SMAD3 signalling was also seen to be suppressed by miR-2909 through induction of SMAD7 via enhanced STAT1 expression.

Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is traditionally diagnosed based on histologic features because expression of current immunohistochemical markers is inconsistent. This is a challenging diagnosis even for expert pathologists and particularly so for pathologists who do not specialize in prostate cancer. New biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are therefore urgently needed. We discovered that FOXA2, a pioneer transcription factor, is frequently and specifically expressed in small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma compared with prostate adenocarcinoma from published mRNA-sequencing data of a wide range of human prostate cancers. We verified the expression of FOXA2 in human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts, patient biopsy specimens, tissue microarrays of prostate cancers with lymph node metastasis, primary small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and metastatic treatment-related small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and cases from a rapid autopsy program. FOXA2 expression was present in NCI-H660 and PC3 neuroendocrine cell lines, but not in LNCAP and CWR22 adenocarcinoma cell lines. Of the human prostate cancer specimens, 20 of 235 specimens (8.5%) showed diagnostic histologic features of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma as judged histologically. Fifteen of 20 small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma tissues (75%) showed strong expression of FOXA2 (staining intensity 2 or 3). FOXA2 expression was also detected in 9 of 215 prostate cancer tissues (4.2%) that were histologically defined as adenocarcinoma. Our findings demonstrate that FOXA2 is a sensitive and specific molecular marker that may be extremely valuable in the pathologic diagnosis of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.""","""['Jung Wook Park', 'John K Lee', 'Owen N Witte', 'Jiaoti Huang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Histone demethylase PHF8 drives neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression by epigenetically upregulating FOXA2.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in the 12T-10 transgenic prostate mouse model mimics endocrine differentiation of pancreatic beta cells.', 'Insulinoma-associated protein 1 is a novel sensitive and specific marker for small cell carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Models of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate: are heterotransplants a better experimental model?', 'The Identification of CELSR3 and Other Potential Cell Surface Targets in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'Salvage focal brachytherapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation after radiation therapy.', 'Single-cell transcriptional regulation and genetic evolution of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.']"""

However, sipuleucel-T demonstrated only modest efficacy in mCPRC patients. Researchers are now investigating the potential of p53 protein as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) loaded in DC-based cancer vaccine. Approximately half of all tumors overexpress p53, and up to 20% of prostate cancer cells overexpresses p53. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of combining p53-DC vaccine and rAd-p53 gene therapy, using the p53-overexpressing and non-expressing prostate cancer cells in vitro. We successfully generated the p53-DC vaccine by culturing autologous DCs infected with rAd-p53. This p53-DC vaccine can differentiate CTLs specifically cytotoxic to p53-overexpressing prostate cancer cells. In addition, rAd-p53 infection can induce overexpression of p53 and thus the cytotoxicity of CTLs differentiated by the p53-DC vaccine in p53 non-expressing prostate cancer cells.

Of these patients, 761 were treated with an empty rectum and comfortably full bladder (RBP) preparation protocol, while for 319 patients no rectal/bladder preparation (NRBP) protocol was adopted.  Results:   Compared with NRBP patients, patients with RBP had significantly higher BDFS (64% vs 48% at 10 years, respectively), CDFS (81% vs 70.5% at 10 years, respectively) and PCSS (95% vs 88% at 10 years, respectively) (log-rank test p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis (MVA) indicated for all treated patients and intermediate high-risk patients that the Gleason score (GS) and the rectal and bladder preparation were the most important prognostic factors for PCSS, CDFS and BDFS. With regard to high- and very high-risk patients, GS, RBP, prostate cancer staging and RT dose were predictors of PCSS, CDFS and BDFS in univariate analysis (UVA).  Conclusion:   We found strong evidence that rectal and bladder preparation significantly decreases biochemical and clinical failures and the probability of death from PCa in patients treated without daily image-guided prostate localization, presumably since patients with RBP are able to maintain a reproducibly empty rectum and comfortably full bladder across the whole treatment compared with NRPB patients.""","""['A Maggio', 'D Gabriele', 'E Garibaldi', 'S Bresciani', 'E Delmastro', 'A Di Dia', 'A Miranti', 'M Poli', 'T Varetto', 'M Stasi', 'P Gabriele']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Prognostic factors in prostate cancer patients treated by radical external beam radiotherapy.', 'Improved clinical outcomes with high-dose image guided radiotherapy compared with non-IGRT for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Treatment-related morbidity in prostate cancer: a\xa0comparison of 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy with and without image guidance using implanted fiducial markers.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'Curative radiotherapy of localized prostate cancer.

This study reports a secondary analysis of baseline data from a lifestyle behavior intervention trial and examines the hypothesis that older cancer survivors who engage in more light-intensity physical activity, independent of moderate-to-vigorous activity, will report better mental quality of life.  Methods:   Older (≥65 years), overweight or obese breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer survivors (n = 641, 54% female) self-reported their physical activity and mental quality of life (i.e., mental health, emotional role functioning, vitality, and social role functioning from the Short-Form 36 Health Status Survey) as a part of the RENEW trial baseline assessment. Analysis of covariance was used to test hypotheses.  Results:   For older women (but not men), light physical activity was positively associated with mental quality of life after adjusting for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Light physical activity that involved social participation appeared to be responsible for this association. For older men (but not women), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was positively associated with mental quality of life.

The combined effects of HIV and cancer on mortality are incompletely understood.Methods: We examined whether individuals with both HIV and cancer have excess mortality using data from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study and the National Center for Health Statistics (1996-2010). We compared age, sex, and race-stratified mortality between people with and without HIV or one of the following cancers: lung, breast, prostate, colorectum, anus, Hodgkin lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We utilized additive Poisson regression models that included terms for HIV, cancer, and an interaction for their combined effect on mortality. We report the number of excess deaths per 1,000 person-years for models with a significant interaction (P < 0.05).Results: For all cancers examined except prostate cancer, at least one demographic subgroup of HIV-infected cancer patients experienced significant excess mortality. Excess mortality was most pronounced at younger ages (30-49 years), with large excesses for males with lung cancer (white race: 573 per 1,000 person-years; non-white: 503) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (white: 236; non-white: 261), and for females with Hodgkin lymphoma (white: 216; non-white: 136) and breast cancer (non-white: 107).Conclusions: In the era of effective HIV treatment, overall mortality in patients with both HIV and cancer was significantly higher than expected on the basis of mortality rates for each disease separately.Impact: These results suggest that HIV may contribute to cancer progression and highlight the importance of improved cancer prevention and care for the U.S. HIV population.

The aim of this study was to examine the experiences of men with sexual dysfunction and their partners following prostate cancer treatment.  Methods:   Men with sexual dysfunction from either surgical removal or radiation therapy 1-5 years after treatment were interviewed, as well as their partners. A mixed method design was used to determine the lived experience of men with sexual dysfunction. Open-ended questions guided the interviews.  Results:   Twenty seven men completed the study with a mean age of 61 years (SD = 8.0; range = 44-77 years). Nine partners also participated. The majority of men (92.6%) had surgery. The average time from treatment to the interview was 23.5 months (SD = 11.7). Themes were frustration with sexual dysfunction, importance of support and understanding from others, depression and anxiety related to sexual dysfunction, importance of intimacy with partner, factors that impact treatment satisfaction, and education and comprehensive information about sex.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer survivors and partners need accurate information about sexual side effects before during and after treatment. Men and partners required individualized help and guidance to manage sexual dysfunction. Support and understanding from partners, family, and others was also identified as an important aspect of healing and adjustment after prostate cancer treatment. Prostate cancer education/support groups played a key role in helping men and partners gain advocacy, education, and support. Psychological problems such as depression and anxiety need to be identified and addressed in men after prostate cancer treatment. Men and partners need assistance in understanding and navigating their way through intimacy to move forward with connectedness in their relationship. Satisfaction with treatment and with providers is dependent on patient education and understanding of all aspects of prostate cancer treatment including sexual side effects and incontinence.""","""['Jeffrey A Albaugh', 'Nat Sufrin', 'Brittany R Lapin', 'Jacqueline Petkewicz', 'Sandi Tenfelde']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""[""Exploring the role of the partner in couples' sexual recovery after surgery for prostate cancer."", 'Prostate cancer patients and their partners: differences in satisfaction indices and psychological variables.', 'Health-Related Quality of Life, Psychological Distress, and Sexual Changes Following Prostate Cancer: A Comparison of Gay and Bisexual Men with Heterosexual Men.', 'Predictors of Patient and Partner Satisfaction Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The psychosocial aspects of sexual recovery after prostate cancer treatment.', 'Sexual characteristics of patients with prostate cancer seen for radiation treatment.', 'Patient-Reported Outcomes After Chemoradiation in Patients With Anal Cancer: A Qualitative Analysis.', 'A modified Delphi study to identify screening items to assess neglected sexual side-effects following prostate cancer treatment.', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'Mapping the prevalence and use of questionnaires to detect the neglected sexual side effects after prostate cancer treatment: a scoping review.']"""

Metabolic stability represents a crucial factor for the success of this approach by ensuring sufficient delivery of circulating radioligand to tumor sites. The amide-to-triazole switch on the backbone of DOTA-PEG4-[Nle14]BBN(7-14) (1) was reported to improve the in vitro stability of resulting 177Lu-radioligands. On the other hand, in-situ inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) by coinjection of phosphoramidon (PA) was shown to significantly improve the in vivo stability and tumor uptake of biodegradable radiopeptides. We herein compare the impact of the two methods on the bioavailability and localization of 177Lu-DOTA-PEG4-[Nle14]BBN(7-14) analogs in GRPR-positive tumors in mice.  Methods:   The 1,4-disubstituted [1-3]-triazole was used to replace one (2: Gly11-His12; 3: Ala9-Val10) or two (4: Ala9-Val10 and Gly11-His12) peptide bonds in 1 (reference) and all compounds were labeled with 177Lu. Each of [177Lu]1-[177Lu]4 was injected without (control) or with PA in healthy mice. Blood samples collected 5min post-injection (pi) were analyzed by HPLC. Biodistribution of [177Lu]1-[177Lu]4 was conducted in SCID mice bearing human prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 xenografts at 4h pi. Groups of 4 animals were injected with radioligand, alone (controls), or with coinjection of PA, or of a mixture of PA and excess and [Tyr4]BBN to determine GRPR-specificity of uptake (Block).  Results:   The in vivo stability of the radioligands was: [177Lu]1 (25% intact), [177Lu]2 (45% intact), [177Lu]3 (30% intact) and [177Lu]4 (40% intact). By PA-coinjection these values notably increased to 90%-93%. Moreover, treatment with PA induced an impressive and GRPR-specific uptake of all radioligands in the PC-3 xenografts at 4h pi: [177Lu]1: 4.7±0.4 to 24.8±4.9%ID/g; [177Lu]2: 8.3±1.2 to 26.0±1.1%ID/g; [177Lu]3: 6.6±0.4 to 21.3±4.4%ID/g; and [177Lu]4: 4.8±1.6 to 13.7±3.8%ID/g.  Conclusions:   This study has shown that amide-to-triazole substitutions in 177Lu-DOTA-PEG4-[Nle14]BBN(7-14) induced minor effects on bioavailability and tumor uptake in mice models, whereas in-situ NEP-inhibition(s) by PA impressively improved in vivo profiles.""","""['Theodosia Maina', 'Aikaterini Kaloudi', 'Ibai E Valverde', 'Thomas L Mindt', 'Berthold A Nock']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['""To serve and protect"": enzyme inhibitors as radiopeptide escorts promote tumor targeting.', 'In vivo inhibition of neutral endopeptidase enhances the diagnostic potential of truncated gastrin (111)In-radioligands.', '(99m)Tc-labeled gastrins of varying peptide chain length: Distinct impact of NEP/ACE-inhibition on stability and tumor uptake in mice.', 'Radiolabeled gastrin/CCK analogs in tumor diagnosis: towards higher stability and improved tumor targeting.', '111In-DOTA-Gly-benzoyl-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2.', 'Optimization of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of 99mTcTc-N4-Bombesin Derivatives by Modification of the Pharmacophoric Gln-Trp Sequence.', 'Radiolabeled Bombesin Analogs.', 'New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging Using Peptide-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer.', 'Cholecystokinin-2 Receptor Targeting with Radiolabeled Peptides: Current Status and Future Directions.', 'Localization of 99mTc-GRP Analogs in GRPR-Expressing Tumors: Effects of Peptide Length and Neprilysin Inhibition on Biological Responses.']"""

Materials and methods:   The study evaluated 205 men who had undergone RP without any adjuvant treatment. All of the patients had positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension and/or seminal vesicle invasion. The patients underwent multiple ultrasensitive PSA measurements on days 14, 30, 60 and 90 after RP, and subsequently at 3 month intervals. The ability of particular PSA measurements to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). A sequential mathematical decision procedure was constructed to create a stratification model.  Results:   During the median follow-up of 45.9 months, 106 patients (51%) experienced BCR. Prediction of BCR in terms of the AUC for PSA measurements on days 14, 30, 60 and 90 after the surgery was 0.61, 0.70, 0.80 and 0.82, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, only PSA after RP remained as a predictor of progression-free survival (p < 0.001). The stratification model based on calculated cut-off values for PSA on day 30 (0.068 ng/ml) and PSA on day 60 (0.015 ng/ml) reduced the potential overtreatment rate by 37%.  Conclusions:   The results imply that ultrasensitive PSA values obtained very early after RP correlate with the presence of recurrent disease in high-risk patients.

An additional aim was to compare the biopsy results to MRI evaluation using a Likert scale.  Materials and methods:   Patients with newly diagnosed localized PCa (n = 53) by clinical routine SB were prospectively included. The majority of the patients were scheduled for curative therapy before enrollment. The patients underwent multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) at 3 T using an endorectal coil followed by two MRI-TBs, using ultrasound with cognitive fusion. All included patients underwent MRI-TB, even those who had low to very low suspicion of significant PCa on mpMRI. The detection rate of significant cancer on SB versus SB + MRI-TB was compared in the 53 included patients and with whole-mounted histopathology as reference in 34 cases. Comparison of the biopsy results to MRI evaluation and interreader agreement calculation of five-point Likert score evaluation were performed.  Results:   In total, 32 significant (Gleason ≥7) PCa were detected by SB, while SB + MRI-TB detected an additional five significant PCa. MRI-TB alone detected 20 and missed 17 significant PCa. Ten of the significant PCa cases missed by MRI-TB had a Likert score of 3 or lower. Interreader agreement using the Likert scale was high, with a kappa value of 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.63-0.92, p < 0.0001).  Conclusion:   Detection of significant PCa increased by adding MRI-TB to SB.

However, recent findings indicate that it may be reversible after all. Vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis (VUAS) as fibrous narrowing is a frequent complication after radical prostatectomy with high recurrence rates and requires invasive treatment. The pathophysiology is poorly understood. Therefore, a combined mRNA and miRNA transcription profiling in tissue from VUAS was performed using nCounter technology.  Methods:   To assess tissue morphology and fiber composition, histochemical staining was performed. RNA expression of healthy and fibrotic tissue of twelve patients was analyzed using the human miRNA panel v3 and mRNA PanCancer pathway panel on the nCounter gene1 system and qRT-PCR. Differential expression data analysis was performed using the nSolver software implementing the R-based advanced pathway analysis tool. miRWalk2.0 was used for miRNA target prediction.  Results:   More linearized tissue architecture, increased collagens, and decreased elastic fibers were observed in VUAS samples. 23 miRNAs and 118 protein coding genes were differentially expressed (p < 0.01) in fibrotic tissue. miRNA target prediction and overlap analysis indicated an interaction of the strongest deregulated miRNAs with 29 deregulated mRNAs. Pathway analysis revealed alterations in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and TGF-beta signaling. qRT-PCR confirmed differential expression of top deregulated miRNAs and mRNAs.  Conclusions:   In VUAS tissue, severe alterations on mRNA and miRNA level are found. These consistent changes give insights into the pathogenesis of VUAS after radical prostatectomy and point to future options for transcriptomics-based risk stratification and targeted therapies.""","""['T S Worst', 'K Daskalova', 'A Steidler', 'K Berner-Leischner', 'R Röth', 'B Niesler', 'C-A Weis', 'M C Kriegmair', 'P Erben', 'D Pfalzgraf']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Treatment of recurrent vesicourethral anastomotic stricture after radical prostatectomy using plasma-button vaporization.', 'Vesico-urethral anastomotic stenosis following radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional outcome analysis with a focus on endoscopic approach, surgical sequence, and the impact of radiation therapy.', 'Impact of Altered WNT2B Expression on Bladder Wall Fibroblasts: Implications for Apoptosis Regulation in the Stroma of the Lower Urinary Tract.', 'Anastomosis stenosis after radical prostatectomy and bladder neck stenosis after benign prostate hyperplasia treatment: reconstructive options.', 'Management of vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis after radical prostatectomy.', 'Contemporary Outcomes after Transurethral Procedures for Bladder Neck Contracture Following Endoscopic Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Posterior urethral stenosis after prostate cancer treatment: contemporary options for definitive management.']"""

However, the apoptotic signaling pathways remain unclear because ZIP9 activates an inhibitory G protein in human cancer cells, whereas recombinant croaker ZIP9 activates a stimulatory G protein (Gs) in transfected cancer cells. We investigated androgen-dependent apoptotic pathways to identify the signaling pathways regulated through wild-type croaker ZIP9 in ovarian follicle cells. We show that the ZIP9-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway in croaker G/T cells shares several proapoptotic members with those in human cancer cells, but is activated through a Gsα subunit-dependent pathway. Testosterone treatment of croaker G/T cells increased intracellular zinc levels, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity, caspase 3 activity, messenger RNA levels of proapoptotic members Bax, p53, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and the incidence of apoptosis, similar to findings in mammalian cancer cells, but also increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentrations. Transfection with small interfering RNA targeting croaker ZIP9 blocked testosterone-induced increase in bax, p53, and jnk expression. Testosterone-induced apoptosis and caspase 3 activation depended on the presence of extracellular zinc and were effectively blocked with cotreatment of inhibitors of the Gsα subunit, adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A, and MAP kinase (Erk1/2) activation. These results indicate that ZIP9-mediated testosterone signaling in croaker G/T cells involves multiple pathways, some of which differ from those activated through ZIP9 in human cancer cells even though a similar apoptotic response is observed.""","""['Aubrey Converse', 'Chenan Zhang', 'Peter Thomas']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Identification and characterization of membrane androgen receptors in the ZIP9 zinc transporter subfamily: I.

We evaluated if a semi-LASER pulse sequence with gradient offset independent adiabaticity refocusing pulses (GOIA-sLASER) for volume selection can meet these requirements.  Materials and methods:   Thirteen patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and 1 patient known to have prostate cancer were examined at 3 T with a multichannel body-receive coil. A 3D-H-MRSI sequence with GOIA-sLASER volume selection (echo time, 88 milliseconds) was added to a routine clinical multiparametric MRI examination of these patients. Repetition times from 630 to 1000 milliseconds and effective voxel sizes of approximately 0.9 and 0.6 cm were tested. Spectral components were quantified by LCModel software for quality assessment and to construct choline and citrate maps.  Results:   Three-dimensional MRSI of the prostate was successfully performed in all patients in measurement times of 5 to 10 minutes. Analysis of the multiparametric MRI examination or of biopsies did not reveal malignant tissue in the prostate of the 13 patients. In 1404 evaluated voxels acquired from 13 patients, the citrate resonance could be fitted with a high reliability (Cramér-Rao lower bound <30%), 100% for 7 × 7 × 7-mm voxels and 96 ± 7 in 6 × 6 × 6-mm voxels. The percentage of 7 × 7 × 7-mm voxels in which the choline signal was fitted with Cramér-Rao lower bound of less than 30% was approximately 50% at a TR of 630 milliseconds and increased to more than 80% for TRs of 800 milliseconds and above. In the patient with prostate cancer, choline was detectable throughout the prostate in spectra recorded at a TR of 700 milliseconds. The homogeneous B1 field over the prostate of the receive coil enabled the generation of whole organ metabolite maps, revealing choline and citrate variations between areas with normal prostate tissue, seminal vesicles, proliferative benign prostatic hyperplasia, and tumor.  Conclusions:   The good signal-to-noise ratio and low chemical shift artifacts of GOIA-sLASER at an echo time of 88 milliseconds enable acquisition of high-quality 3D-H-MRSI of the prostate without endorectal coil in less than 10 minutes.

Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to docetaxel or cabazitaxel. Men who did not achieve ≥ 30% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline by cycle 4 (C4) switched taxane. The primary clinical endpoint was confirmed ≥ 50% PSA decline versus historical control (TAX327). The primary biomarker endpoint was analysis of post-treatment CTCs to confirm the hypothesis that clinical response was associated with taxane drug-target engagement, evidenced by decreased percent androgen receptor nuclear localization (%ARNL) and increased microtubule bundling. Results Sixty-three patients were randomly assigned to docetaxel (n = 41) or cabazitaxel (n = 22); 44.4% received prior potent androgen receptor-targeted therapy. Overall, 35 patients (55.6%) had confirmed ≥ 50% PSA responses, exceeding the historical control rate of 45.4% (TAX327). Of 61 treated patients, 33 (54.1%) had ≥ 30% PSA declines by C4 and did not switch taxane, 15 patients (24.6%) who did not achieve ≥ 30% PSA declines by C4 switched taxane, and 13 patients (21.3%) discontinued therapy before or at C4. Of patients switching taxane, 46.7% subsequently achieved ≥ 50% PSA decrease. In 26 CTC-evaluable patients, taxane-induced decrease in %ARNL (cycle 1 day 1 v cycle 1 day 8) was associated with a higher rate of ≥ 50% PSA decrease at C4 ( P = .009). Median composite progression-free survival was 9.1 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 11.7 months); median overall survival was not reached at 14 months. Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events included fatigue (13.1%) and febrile neutropenia (11.5%). Conclusion The early taxane switch strategy was associated with improved PSA response rates versus TAX327.

Setting:   Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. .  Sample:   130 caregivers aged 60 years or older caring for individuals with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer. .  Methods:   Self-report survey including validated questionnaires on physical and mental health and physical activity levels. Convenience sampling was used. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlations, and multiple regression. .  Main research variables:   The physical component score of the SF-36v2® was the main research variable. Other variables included the mental component score of the SF-36v2, sleep quality, depression, social support, physical activity levels, and anxiety. .  Findings:   The mean age of caregivers was 70 years. Physical health and physical activity levels were higher than population norms. A significant difference in physical health (p = 0.015) existed between men and women but not in physical activity levels (p = 0.079). Predictors of physical activity levels were age (β = -0.291), physical health (β = 0.307), and caregiving hours per week (β = -0.221). .  Conclusions:   The findings suggest that gender had a minimal effect on physical health and no effect on physical activity levels in older caregivers. Depression and poor sleep quality were high in some caregivers but did not predict physical activity levels. .  Implications for nursing:   The negative effects of caregiving on physical health and physical activity levels in older caregivers are not universal.

It is demonstrated to be involved in a number of disorders, including cancer, gastrointestinal diseases, and autoimmune diseases. In addition, TSLP is also found to be able to induce itch sensation by directly activating the itch sensory neurons. The expression of human TSLP is detected in various tissues such as heart, liver, testis, and prostate. In this study, we report that TSLP was expressed in the human corneal stromal cells, the highly specialized cells that are critical for the function of the cornea. Furthermore, we found that activation of the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) induced secretion of TSLP by the corneal stromal cells. Beside the canonical activator thrombin, PAR1 can also be activated by a few matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) such as MMP1 and MMP13. Since MMPs including MMP1 and MMP13 are upregulated in many corneal diseases as well as the corneal wound healing process, we proposed that TSLP might function as the link between increased protease activity and inflammatory responses or itch sensation in the corneas. © 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(8):606-610, 2017.""","""['Hongbo Yin', 'Yan Tian', 'Rongying Luo', 'Yingping Deng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""IUBMB Life""","""['Human corneal epithelium-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin links the innate and adaptive immune responses via TLRs and Th2 cytokines.', 'Interleukin-32 induced thymic stromal lymphopoietin plays a critical role in the inflammatory response in human corneal epithelium.', 'Thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor blockade reduces allergic inflammation in a cynomolgus monkey model of asthma.', 'Thymic stromal lymphopoietin and OX40 ligand pathway in the initiation of dendritic cell-mediated allergic inflammation.', 'Expression and Regulation of Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin and Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin Receptor Heterocomplex in the Innate-Adaptive Immunity of Pediatric Asthma.']"""

Contemporary patterns of care are unknown. We hypothesize the use of surgery has steadily increased in more recent years.  Methods:   Using the National Cancer Data Base for 2004-2013, all men diagnosed with high-risk localized PCa were identified using National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. Temporal trends in initial management were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Results:   In total, 127 391 men were identified. Use of RP increased from 26% in 2004 to 42% in 2013 (adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1.51, 95% CI 1.42-1.60, P<0.001), while external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) decreased from 49% to 42% (P<0.001). African American men had lower odds of undergoing RP (unadjusted rate of 28%, adjusted RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.66-0.72, <0.001) compared to White men (37%). Age was inversely associated with likelihood of receiving RP. Having private insurance was significantly associated with the increased use of RP (vs Medicare, adjusted odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, P=0.015). Biopsy Gleason scores 8-10 with and without any primary Gleason 5 pattern were associated with decreased odds of RP (vs Gleason score ⩽6, both P<0.001). Academic and comprehensive cancer centers were more likely to perform RP compared to community hospitals (both P<0.001).  Conclusion:   The likelihood of receiving RP for high-risk PCa dramatically increased from 2004 to 2013. By 2013, the use of RP and EBRT were similar.

It is highly upregulated in hypoxic regions and mediates pH regulation critical for tumor cell survival as well as extracellular acidification of the tumor microenvironment, which promotes tumor aggressiveness via various mechanisms, such as augmenting metastatic potential. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the complex interdependency between CA IX and the tumor microenvironment in prostate tumor cells with regard to potential therapeutic implications. CA IX was upregulated by hypoxia as well as acidosis in prostate cancer cells. This induction did not modulate intracellular pH but led to extracellular acidification. Pharmacological inhibition of CA IX activity by U104 (SLC-0111) resulted in a reduction in tumor cell growth and an increase in apoptotic cell death. Intracellular pH was reduced under normoxic and even more so under hypoxic conditions when CA IX level was high. However, although intracellular pH regulation was disturbed, targeting CA IX in combination with daunorubicin or cisplatin did not intensify apoptotic tumor cell death. Hence, targeting CA IX in prostate cancer cells can lead to intracellular pH dysregulation and, consequently, can reduce cellular growth and elevate apoptotic cell death. Attenuation of extracellular acidification by blocking CA IX might additionally impede tumor progression and metastasis.

M2 Macrophages, one type of tumor-associated macrophages, are involved in prostate cancer growth and progression. Protein kinase C zeta has been shown to suppress prostate cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis as a tumor suppressor; however, its role in chemotaxis and activation of tumor-associated macrophages remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of protein kinase C zeta of prostate cancer cells in regulation of macrophage chemotaxis and M2 phenotype activation. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the expression of protein kinase C zeta and the number of CD206+ M2 macrophages in human prostate tissue. Macrophage chemotaxis and polarization were examined using Transwell migration assays and a co-culture system. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect M2 markers, protein kinase C zeta, interleukin-4, and interleukin-10 expression. We found the expression of protein kinase C zeta increased in prostate cancer tissues, especially in the early stage, and was negatively associated with tumor grade and the number of CD206+ macrophages. Inhibition of protein kinase C zeta expression in prostate cancer cells promoted chemotaxis of peripheral macrophages and acquisition of M2 phenotypic features. These results were further supported by the finding that silencing of endogenous protein kinase C zeta promoted the expression of prostate cancer cell-derived interleukin-4 and interleukin-10. These results suggest that protein kinase C zeta plays an important role in reducing infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages and activation of a pro-tumor M2 phenotype, which may constitute an important mechanism by which protein kinase C zeta represses cancer progression.""","""['Hui-Hui Fan', 'Ling Li', 'Yu-Ming Zhang', 'Jie Yang', 'Mao-Cheng Li', 'Fang-Yin Zeng', 'Fan Deng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Blocking Interleukin (IL)4- and IL13-Mediated Phosphorylation of STAT6 (Tyr641) Decreases M2 Polarization of Macrophages and Protects Against Macrophage-Mediated Radioresistance of Inflammatory Breast Cancer.', 'Endogenous IFN-β maintains M1 polarization status and inhibits proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Alternatively Activated (M2) Macrophage Phenotype Is Inducible by Endothelin-1 in Cultured Human Macrophages.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Tumor-derived exosomal microRNAs and proteins as modulators of macrophage function.', 'The Roles of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.', 'Hypermethylation of PRKCZ Regulated by E6 Inhibits Invasion and EMT via Cdc42 in HPV-Related Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'The PTEN Conundrum: How to Target PTEN-Deficient Prostate Cancer.', 'Activity to Breast Cancer Cell Lines of Different Malignancy and Predicted Interaction with Protein Kinase C Isoforms of Royleanones.', 'Trabectedin Reduces Skeletal Prostate Cancer Tumor Size in Association with Effects on M2 Macrophages and Efferocytosis.']"""

To improve TGX221's aqueous solubility, in this study, we characterized four recently synthesized TGX221 analogs.  Methods:   TGX221 analog efficacy were examined in multiple prostate cancer cell lines with the SRB cell growth assay, Western blot assay for AKT phosphorylation and cell cycle protein levels. Target engagement with PI3K isoforms was evaluated with cellular thermal shift assay. PI3K activity was determined with the Kinase-Glo Plus luminescent kinase assay. Cell cycle distribution was evaluated with flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining.  Results:   As expected, replacing either one of two major functional groups in TGX221 by more hydrophilic groups dramatically improved the aqueous solubility (about 40-fold) compared to TGX221. In the CETSA assay, all the analogs dramatically shifted the melting curve of p110β protein while none of them largely affected the melting curves of p110α, p110γ, or Akt proteins, indicating target-specific engagement of these analogs with p110β protein. However, functional evaluation showed that only one of the analogs BL140 ubiquitously inhibited AKT phosphorylation in all CRPC cell lines tested with diverse genetic abnormalities including AR, PTEN, and p53 status. BL140 was superior than GSK2636771 (IC50 5.74 vs 20.49 nM), the only p110β-selective inhibitor currently in clinical trials, as revealed in an in vitro Kinase-Glo assay. Furthermore, BL140 exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect than GSK2636771 on multiple CRPC cell lines including a MDV3100-resistant C4-2B cell subline, indicating BL140 elimination of MDV3100 resistance. Mechanistic studies revealed that BL140 blocked G1 phase cell cycle entry by reducing cyclin D1 but increasing p27kip1 protein levels.  Conclusion:   These studies suggested that BL140 is a promising p110β-specific inhibitor with multiple superb properties than GSK2636771 worthy for further clinical development.""","""['Chenchen He', 'Shaofeng Duan', 'Liang Dong', 'Yifen Wang', 'Qingting Hu', 'Chunjing Liu', 'Marcus L Forrest', 'Jeffrey M Holzbeierlein', 'Suxia Han', 'Benyi Li']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Nanomicellar TGX221 blocks xenograft tumor growth of prostate cancer in nude mice.', 'P110β Inhibition Reduces Histone H3K4 Di-Methylation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Inhibition of the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway Overcomes Resistance to Enzalutamide in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'PI3K/p110β-specific inhibitors in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: targeting the mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide.', 'Viscosalactone B, a natural LSD1 inhibitor, inhibits proliferation in vitro and in vivo against prostate cancer cells.', 'Overcoming the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to new generation hormonal therapies in advanced prostate cancer: focus on androgen receptor independent pathways.', 'Hsa_circ_0030586 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer via PI3K-AKT signaling.', 'Overexpression of CXCR7 is a Novel Indicator for Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'PI3K inhibitors are finally coming of age.']"""

Methods:   MiR-500 expression was assessed by qRT-PCR in prostate cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Cancer patients' clinicopathological factors and overall survival were analyzed according to endogenous miR-500 level. MiR-500 was downregulated in DU145 and VCaP cells. Its effect on prostate cancer proliferation, invasion in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo, were probed. Possible downstream target of miR-500, TFPI was assessed by luciferase assay and qRT-PCR in prostate cancer cells. In miR-500-downregulated DU145 and VCaP cells, TFPI was silenced to see whether it was directly involved in the regulation of miR-500 in prostate cancer. TFPI alone was either upregulated or downregulated in DU145 and VCaP cells. Their effect on prostate cancer development was further evaluated.  Results:   MiR-500 is upregulated in both prostate cancer cells and primary tumors. In prostate cancer patients, high miR-500 expression is associated with poor prognosis and overall survival. In DU145 and VCaP cells, miR-500 downregulation inhibited cancer proliferation, invasion in vitro, and explant growth in vivo. TFPI was verified to be associated with miR-500 in prostate cancer. Downregulation of TFPI reversed anti-cancer effects of miR-500 downregulation in prostate cancer cells. However, neither TFPI upregulation nor downregulation alone had any functional impact on prostate cancer development.  Conclusion:   MiR-500 may be a potential biomarker and molecular target in prostate cancer. TFPI may conditionally regulate prostate cancer in miR-500-downregualted prostate cancer cells.""","""['Bing Cai', 'Wei Chen', 'Yue Pan', 'Hongde Chen', 'Yirong Zhang', 'Zhiliang Weng', 'Yeping Li']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['MicroRNA-384 is lowly expressed in human prostate cancer cells and has anti-tumor functions by acting on HOXB7.', 'MicroRNA-494-3p targets CXCR4 to suppress the proliferation, invasion, and migration of prostate cancer.', 'Significantly altered expression of miR-511-3p and its target AKT3 has negative prognostic value in human prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-138 is a potential biomarker and tumor suppressor in human cervical carcinoma by reversely correlated with TCF3 gene.', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.', 'Activation of miR-500a-3p/CDK6 axis suppresses aerobic glycolysis and colorectal cancer progression.', 'Integrated bioinformatics analysis and screening of hub genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'Telomerase reverse transcriptase activates transcription of miR500A to inhibit Hedgehog signalling and promote cell invasiveness.', 'Plasma extracellular vesicle microRNAs for pulmonary ground-glass nodules.', 'High expression of microRNA-500 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.']"""

Radium-223 provides a new treatment option for this setting, but also necessitates a new treatment management approach. We provide straightforward and practical recommendations for European nuclear medicine centres to optimize radium-223 service provision.  Methods:   An independent research consultancy agency observed radium-223 procedures and conducted interviews with all key staff members involved in radium-223 treatment delivery in 11 nuclear medicine centres across six countries (Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the UK) experienced in administering radium-223. The findings were collated and discussed at a meeting of experts from these centres, during which key consensus recommendations were defined.  Results:   The recommendations cover centre organization and preparation; patient referral; radium-223 ordering, preparation and disposal; radium-223 treatment delivery/administration; and patient experience. Guidance includes structured coordination and communication within centres and multidisciplinary teams, focusing on sharing best practice to provide high-quality, patient-centred care throughout the treatment pathway.

The exposure-activity relationship was investigated in mouse xenograft models of human prostate cancer, breast cancer, and gastric cancer by comparing antitumor activity after single and fractionated dosing with tumor-targeting ADCs conjugated to SG3249, a potent PBD dimer. The exposure-tolerability relationship was similarly investigated in rat and monkey toxicology studies by comparing tolerability, as assessed by survival, body weight, and organ-specific toxicities, after single and fractionated dosing with ADCs conjugated to SG3249 (rats) or SG3400, a structurally related PBD (monkeys).Results: Observations of similar antitumor activity in mice treated with single or fractionated dosing suggests that antitumor activity of PBD ADCs is more closely related to total exposure (AUC) than peak drug concentrations (Cmax). In contrast, improved survival and reduced toxicity in rats and monkeys treated with a fractionated dosing schedule suggests that tolerability of PBD ADCs is more closely associated with Cmax than AUC.Conclusions: We provide the first evidence that fractionated dosing can improve preclinical tolerability of at least some PBD ADCs without compromising efficacy. These findings suggest that preclinical exploration of dosing schedule could be an important clinical strategy to improve the therapeutic window of highly potent ADCs and should be investigated further.

Objectives:   To compare diagnostic yield of image fusion guided prostate biopsy using image fusion of multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) with 3D-TRUS.  Materials and methods:   Between January 2010 and April 2013, 179 consecutive patients underwent outpatient TRUS biopsy using the real-time 3D TRUS tracking system (Urostation™). These patients underwent MRI-TRUS fusion targeted biopsies (TB) with 3D volume data of the MRI elastically fused with 3D TRUS at the time of biopsy.  Results:   A hundred and seventy-three patients had TBs with fusion. Mean biopsy core per patient were 11.1 (6-14) for SB and 2.4 (1-6) for TB. SBs were positive in 11% compared to 56% for TB (P<0.001). TB outperformed systematic biopsy(SB) in overall any cancer detection rate, detection of clinically significant cancer (58% vs. 36%), cancer core length (6.8mm vs. 2.8mm), and cancer rate per core (P<0.001). In multivariable logistic regression, with TB we have more chance to find a clinically significant cancer (OR:3.72 [2-6.95]). When both TRUS and MRI are positive, there is 2.73 more chance to find a clinically significant cancer.  Conclusion:   MR/TRUS elastic fusion-guided biopsies outperform systematic random biopsies in diagnosing clinically significant cancer. Ability of interpretation of real-time TRUS is essential to perform the higher level of MR/US fusion and should be use for active surveillance.

Although current guidelines recommend HRQOL assessment in clinical urology, specific guidance on how to assess HRQOL is frequently absent. We evaluated whether and how urologists assess HRQOL and how they determine its practicality.  Methods:   A random sample of 4500 (from 5200 identified German urologists) was drawn and invited to participate in a postal survey (an initial letter followed by one reminder after six weeks). The questionnaire included questions on whether and how HRQOL is assessed, general attitudes towards the concept of HRQOL, and socio-demographics. Due to the exploratory character of the study we produced mainly descriptive statistics. Chi2-tests and logistic regression were used for subgroup-analysis.  Results:   1557 urologists (85% male, with a mean age of 49 yrs.) participated. Most of them (87%) considered HRQOL assessment as 'important' in daily work, while only 7% reported not assessing HRQOL. Patients with prostate carcinoma, incontinence, pain, and benign prostate hyperplasia were the main target groups for HRQOL assessment. The primary aim of HRQOL assessment was to support treatment decisions, monitor patients, and produce a 'baseline measurement'. Two-thirds of urologists used questionnaires and interviews to evaluate HRQOL and one-quarter assessed HRQOL by asking: 'How are you?'. The main barriers to HRQOL assessment were anticipated questionnaire costs (77%), extensive questionnaire length (52%), and complex analysis (51%).  Conclusions:   The majority of German urologists assess HRQOL as part of their clinical routine. However, knowledge of HRQOL assessment, analysis, and interpretation seems to be limited in this group. Therefore, urologists may benefit from a targeted education program.

Breviscapine (BVP) is a mixture of flavonoid glycosides, derived from the Chinese herbs. Previous researches have indicated that BVP has comprehensive pharmacological functions. However, little is known about whether BVP has preventive effects on human prostate cancer. Here, we attempted to explore if BVP inhibits human prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo in a comprehensive manner. We found that BVP triggered cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cell lines dose-dependently. BVP-induced DNA damage caused the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and further induced cell death. High expression of MCM-7 was reduced in BVP-treated cancer cells and tumor tissues, and also the DNA damage response marker of γH2AX is down-regulated by BVP, associated with MCM-7 expression through regulating retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and checkpoint control proteins expression. Additionally, BVP induced apoptotic response in prostate cancer cells and tumors via activating Caspase-3 and PARP. In vivo studies indicated that BVP impeded tumor growth in xenograft animal models.

Accumulative data indicate that curcumin may induce cancer cell death. However, the detailed mechanism underlying its pro-apoptotic and anti-cancer effects remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we examined the signaling pathways triggered by curcumin, specifically, the exact molecular mechanisms of curcumin-induced apoptosis in highly metastatic human prostate cancer cells. The effect of curcumin was evaluated using for the first time in prostate cancer, a gel-free shotgun quantitative proteomic analysis coupled with Tandem Mass Tag isobaric labeling-based-signaling networks. Results were confirmed at the gene expression level by qRT-PCR and at the protein expression level by western blot and flow cytometry. Our findings revealed that curcumin induced an Endoplasmic Reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in PC3. The mechanisms by which curcumin promoted cell death in these cells were associated with cell cycle arrest, increased reactive oxygen species, autophagy and the Unfolded Protein Response. Furthermore, the upregulation of ER stress was measured using key indicators of ER stress: Glucose-Regulated Protein 78, Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 alpha, Protein Disulfide isomerase and Calreticulin. Chronic ER stress induction was concomitant with the upregulation of pro-apoptotic markers (caspases 3,9,12) and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. The downregulated proteins include anti-apoptotic and anti-tumor markers, supporting their curcumin-induced pro-apoptotic role in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, these data suggest that curcumin may serve as a promising anticancer agent by inducing a chronic ER stress mediated cell death and activation of cell cycle arrest, UPR, autophagy and oxidative stress responses.""","""['Mariela Rivera', 'Yanilda Ramos', 'Madeline Rodríguez-Valentín', 'Sheila López-Acevedo', 'Luis A Cubano', 'Jin Zou', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Guangdi Wang', 'Nawal M Boukli']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Muscadine Grape Skin Extract Induces an Unfolded Protein Response-Mediated Autophagy in Prostate Cancer Cells: A TMT-Based Quantitative Proteomic Analysis.', 'Curcumin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated apoptosis in human papillary thyroid carcinoma BCPAP cells via disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis.', 'Nonautophagic cytoplasmic vacuolation death induction in human PC-3M prostate cancer by curcumin through reactive oxygen species -mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress.', 'Potential anticancer properties and mechanisms of action of curcumin.', 'Curcumin combined with photodynamic therapy, promising therapies for the treatment of cancer.', 'Oncogenic Proteomics Approaches for Translational Research and HIV-Associated Malignancy Mechanisms.', 'The Antiviral Compound PSP Inhibits HIV-1 Entry via PKR-Dependent Activation in Monocytic Cells.', 'Dasatinib enhances curcumin-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis and protective autophagy in human schwannoma cells HEI-193: The role of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signalling pathway.', 'New Visions on Natural Products and Cancer Therapy: Autophagy and Related Regulatory Pathways.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.']"""

However, tumor heterogeneity may influence miRNA expression. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of tumor heterogeneity, as demonstrated by a panel of selected miRNAs in PCa, and to correlate miRNA expression with risk profile and patient outcome.  Material and methods:   Prostatectomy specimens and matched, preoperative needle biopsies from a retrospective cohort of 49 patients, who underwent curatively intended surgery for localized PCa, were investigated with a panel of 6 miRNAs (miRNA-21, miRNA-34a, miRNA-125b, miRNA-126, miRNA-143, and miRNA-145) using tissue micro-array (TMA) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Inter- and intra-patient variation was assessed using intra-class correlation (ICC).  Results:   Four miRNAs (miRNA-21, miRNA-34a, miRNA-125, and miRNA-126) were significantly upregulated in PCa compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and except for miRNA-21 these miRNAs documented a positive correlation between the expression level in PCa cores and their matched BPH cores, (r > 0.72). The ICC varied from 0.451 to 0.764, with miRNA-34a showing an intra-tumoral heterogeneity accounting for less than 50% of the total variation. Regarding clinicopathological outcomes, only miRNA-143 showed potential as a prognostic marker with a higher expression correlating with longer relapse-free survival (p = 0.016).  Conclusion:   The present study documents significant upregulation of the expression of miRNA-21, miRNA-34a, miRNA-125, and miRNA-126 in PCa compared to BPH and suggests a possible prognostic value associated with the expression of miRNA-143.

Most men with mCRPC are > 65 years of age and thus eligible for Medicare Part D. We conducted a study to better understand the early dissemination of these drugs across the United States using national Medicare Part D data.  Methods:   We evaluated the number of prescriptions for abiraterone and enzalutamide by provider specialty and hospital referral region (HRR) using Medicare Part D and Dartmouth Atlas data. We categorized HRRs by abiraterone and enzalutamide prescriptions, adjusted for prostate cancer incidence, and examined factors associated with regional variation using multilevel regression models.  Results:   Among providers who wrote the majority of prescriptions for abiraterone or enzalutamide in 2013 (n = 2,121), 87.5% were medical oncologists, 3.3% were urologists, and 9.2% were other provider specialties. Among prescribers, approximately 30% were responsible for three quarters of the claims for abiraterone and 20% were responsible for more than half the claims for enzalutamide. Some HRRs demonstrated low-prescribing rates despite average medical oncology and urology physician workforce density. Our multilevel model demonstrated that regional factors potentially influenced variation in care.  Conclusion:   The majority of prescriptions written for abiraterone and enzalutamide through Medicare Part D in 2013 were written by a minority of providers, with marked regional variation across the United States.

Unfortunately, once cancer spreads outside of prostate, it becomes incurable. Androgen deprivation can provide some relief, but resistance will develop eventually, and at that time no effective treatment options are left to the patient. Therefore, the search of alternative treatment modalities is paramount. In this article we evaluated the role of epigenetic modifier 5-azacitidine (5-AzaC) and immunomodulator - Lenalidomide and their possible impact on the immune response in the murine prostate cancer model. We studied their impact on murine prostate cancer cells and on dendritic cells (DC), the most potent antigen-presenting cells known. RM-1 is a murine prostate cancer cell line, resembling hormone-independent model, which is a lethal variant of this disease in humans. Dendritic cells were obtained from murine bone marrow. Cell proliferation assays were performed to evaluate the effect of 5-AzaC and lenalidomide on prostate cancer and DC. Flow cytometry, ELISA and real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the effect of these compounds on DC and prostate cancer cells. 5-AzaC treatment of RM-1 prostate cancer cells and DC resulted in the decreased proliferation for both, while lenalidomide had no effect. DC were treated with lenalidomide and the expression of surface markers MHC Class I, MHC Class II, CD80, CD86, CD 205, and CD40 was increased. Secretion of IL-12 and IL-15 by DC increased significantly with addition of 5-AzaC. There was also the change in the expression of endothelin receptors on DC, which can affect their function. 5-AzaC also resulted in the increased expression of cancer-testis antigen, P1A, by prostate cancer cells. Combination of epigenetic modifications and immunomodulation by 5-AzaC and lenalidomide should increase tumor immunogenicity and it enhanced DC function. Therefore, these compounds might have a role in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['N Mitskevich', 'T Tsertsvadze', 'K Mchedlishvili', 'K Matchavariani', 'G Guruli']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Georgian Med News""","""['Role of Epigenetic Modification and Immunomodulation in a Murine Prostate Cancer Model.', 'Tumor cyclooxygenase 2-dependent suppression of dendritic cell function.', 'Combination therapy with dendritic cells and lenalidomide is an effective approach to enhance antitumor immunity in a mouse colon cancer model.', 'Route of administration influences the antitumor effects of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells engineered to produce interleukin-12 in a metastatic mouse prostate cancer model.', 'Targeted Toxins for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Therefore, the research of Fuc glycoproteins has attracted increasing attention recently in the analytical field. Herein, a strategy based on lectin affinity enrichments of intact glycopeptides followed by mass spectrometry has been established to evaluate the specificities of various Fuc-binding lectins for glycosite-specific Fuc analysis of nonaggressive (NAG) and aggressive (AG) Pca cell lines. The enrichment specificities of Fuc glycopeptides using lectins (LCA, PSA, AAL, LTL, UEA I, and AOL) and MAX extraction cartridges alone, or in tandem, were evaluated. Our results showed that the use of lectin enrichment significantly increased the ratio of fucosylated glycopeptides to total glycopeptides compared to MAX enrichment. Furthermore, tandem use of lectin followed by MAX increased the number of identifications of Fuc glycopeptides compared to using lectin enrichment alone. LCA, PSA, and AOL showed stronger binding capacity than AAL, LTL, and UEA I. Also, LCA and PSA bound specifically to core Fuc, whereas AOL, AAL, and UEA I showed binding to both core Fuc and branch Fuc. The optimized enrichment method with tandem enrichment of LCA followed by MAX (LCA-MAX) was then applied to examine the Fuc glycoproteomes in two NAG and two AG Pca cell lines. In total, 973 intact Fuc glycopeptides were identified and quantified from 252 Fuc proteins by using the tandem-mass-tags (TMT) labeling and nanoliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis. Further data analysis revealed that 51 Fuc glycopeptides were overexpressed more than 2-fold in AG cell lines compared to NAG cells.

A bioluminescence tomography (BLT) system which can directly reconstruct the internal luminescent tumors, was developed and integrated with CT system to accurately guide radiation dose delivery.  Methods:   The BLT system, employing a lens-coupled CCD camera, was physically registered with an onboard cone beam CT system in an image-guided small animal arc radiation treatment system (iSMAART). The onboard CT provides animal anatomy and accurate surface contour used to construct the three-dimensional mesh for the BLT reconstruction. Bioluminescence projections were captured from multiple angles, once every 90° rotation. The BLT reconstruction was performed on an orthotopic prostate tumor model to evaluate its robustness and accuracy in locating and delineating bioluminescent tumors. The location and volume of the tumor identified from iodinated contrast CT was used to validate the BLT performance. Phantom experiment was also conducted to confirm the precision of BLT-guided radiation.  Results:   The BLT was able to accurately locate the bioluminescent tumors with < 0.5 mm error. The tumor volume in BLT was significantly correlated with that in the iodinated contrast CT (R2 = 0.81, P < 0.001). Phantom experiments further validated that BLT can be used to guide radiation with submillimeter accuracy.  Conclusion:   Together with CT, BLT can provide precision radiation guidance and robust tumor volume assessment in small animal cancer research.""","""['Junwei Shi', 'Thirupandiyur S Udayakumar', 'Zhiqun Wang', 'Nesrin Dogan', 'Alan Pollack', 'Yidong Yang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Optical molecular imaging-guided radiation therapy part 2: Integrated x-ray and fluorescence molecular tomography.', 'A Multimodality Image Guided Precision Radiation Research Platform: Integrating X-ray, Bioluminescence, and Fluorescence Tomography With Radiation Therapy.', 'Systematic calibration of an integrated x-ray and optical tomography system for preclinical radiation research.', 'Image guidance in radiation therapy for better cure of cancer.', 'AI-Augmented Images for X-Ray Guiding Radiation Therapy Delivery.', 'Longitudinal Tracing of Lyssavirus Infection in Mice via In Vivo Bioluminescence Imaging.', 'Quantitative Bioluminescence Tomography-Guided Conformal Irradiation for Preclinical Radiation Research.', 'Noninvasive assessment of radiation-induced renal injury in mice.', 'In vivo bioluminescence tomography-guided radiation research platform for pancreatic cancer: an initial study using subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic tumor models.', 'Quantitative X-ray fluorescence imaging of gold nanoparticles using joint L1 and total variation regularized reconstruction.']"""

Interestingly, treatment of therapy-sensitive tumors in heterogeneous tumor microenvironments results in apoptosis of therapy-resistant tumors. In this study, we identify a prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) amino-terminal fragment (PAF) that is released by diverse therapy-sensitive cancer cells following therapy-induced caspase cleavage of the tumor suppressor Par-4 protein. PAF caused apoptosis in cancer cells resistant to therapy and inhibited tumor growth. A VASA segment of Par-4 mediated its binding and degradation by the ubiquitin ligase Fbxo45, resulting in loss of Par-4 proapoptotic function. Conversely, PAF, which contains this VASA segment, competitively bound to Fbxo45 and rescued Par-4-mediated induction of cancer cell-specific apoptosis. Collectively, our findings identify a molecular decoy naturally generated during apoptosis that inhibits a ubiquitin ligase to overcome therapy resistance in tumors.

With recent focus on patient-provider communication (PC) and the guidelines recommending against PSA tests for prostate cancer (PCa), PC regarding the PSA test might affect PSA screening rates.  Materials and methods:   We used the fourth edition of the Health Information National Trends Survey, a nationally-representative US survey on the use of cancer-related information. The survey was conducted in 3 cycles: October 2011 to January 2012 (cycle 1); October 2012 to January 2013 (cycle 2); September 2013 to October 2013 (cycle 3). Logistic regression was used to study the effect of PC on respondents' uptake of the PSA test.  Results:   Most of the respondents were 51 to 65 years old, white, with college or higher education, were married, and had health insurance. PC regarding the PSA test greatly increased the chances of screening for PCa using the PSA test in all 3 cycles (odds ratio [OR], 2.51 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.03-3.10] in cycle 1; OR, 3.50 [95% CI, 2.51-4.88] in cycle 2; OR, 2.69 [95% CI, 2.02-3.58] in cycle 3).  Conclusion:   Our study showed that PC increased the likelihood of patients undergoing PSA screening. In light of the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommending against screening for PCa, PC seemed to have an opposite effect. Although updated PC that educates patients on the risks and benefits of PSA screening is needed, patients classically overemphasize benefits and underemphasize risks-which might increase rather than decrease PSA screening rates.""","""['Mohammad Rifat Haider', 'Zaina P Qureshi', 'Ronnie Horner', 'Daniela B Friedman', 'Charles Bennett']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'Testing and referral patterns in the years surrounding the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation against prostate-specific antigen screening.', 'Impact of Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Screening Trials and Revised PSA Screening Guidelines on Rates of Prostate Biopsy and Postbiopsy Complications.', 'The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the USA.', ""Impact of the United States Preventive Services Task Force 'D' recommendation on prostate cancer screening and staging."", 'Predictors of annual prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening among black men: results from an urban community-based prostate cancer screening program.', 'Future Perspectives and Challenges of Prostate MR Imaging.']"""

Method:   A total of 333 patients were treated with EBRT. Of these, 285 underwent radical therapy and 48 underwent postoperative therapy (39 cases of rescue and 9 of adjuvant therapy). We collected clinical, tumour and dosimetric variable to correlate with toxicity parameters. We developed decision trees based on the degree of statistical significance.  Results:   The rate of severe acute toxicity, both urinary and rectal, was 5.4% and 1.5%, respectively. The rate of chronic toxicity was 4.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Twenty-seven patients presented haematuria, and 9 presented haemorrhagic rectitis. Twenty-five patients (7.5%) presented permanent limiting sequela. The patients with lower urinary tract symptoms prior to the radiation therapy presented poorer tolerance, with greater acute bladder toxicity (P=0.041). In terms of acute rectal toxicity, 63% of the patients with mean rectal doses >45Gy and anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy developed mild toxicity compared with 37% of the patients with mean rectal doses <45 Gy and without anticoagulant therapy. We were unable to establish predictors of chronic toxicity in the multivariate analysis. The long-term sequelae were greater in the patients who underwent urological operations prior to the radiation therapy and who were undergoing anticoagulant therapy.  Conclusions:   The tolerance to EBRT was good, and severe toxicity was uncommon. Baseline urinary symptoms constitute the predictor that most influenced the acute urinary toxicity.

Currently, the impact of DIR-algorithm-associated uncertainties in proton therapy is unclear. Here, we quantify the effect of DIR uncertainties on prostate passive-scattering proton therapy (PSPT) dose accumulation. Ten patients with an intermediate risk for prostate cancer formerly treated by PSPT (PTV D95=78GyE) were studied. Dose distributions from all verification CT images (five images per patient) were warped and accumulated in the planning CT geometries with DIR. The dose-volume histogram parameters (Dmean, V40, and V70) for rectum and bladder were calculated. Two commercially available DIR software packages were employed: Velocity AI (Varian Medical Systems) and RayStation (RaySearch Laboratories). The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and surface distance, which were calculated between planning CT contours and deformed contours, were used for DIR validation, with the relationship between the dose parameter and DIR uncertainty ultimately investigated. On average, when using RayStation, the DSC increased by 0.14 and surface distance decreased by 6.4mm, as compared to Velocity. For Dmean, V40, and V70 to the rectum, the average differences between the RayStation and Velocity were 3.9GyE, 5.5%, and 3.2%, respectively. For the bladder, the differences were 5.2GyE, 5.8%, and 5.4%, respectively. The maximum differences in V40 between RayStation and Velocity were 14.4% and 22.8% for the rectum and bladder, respectively, when the average DSC and surface distance differences were more than 0.14 and 6.4mm, respectively.

Inter- and intra-fraction catheter displacements have been reported. Unrecognized displacement can have a significant impact on dosimetry. Knowledge of the implant geometry at the time of treatment is important for ensuring safe and effective treatment. In this work we demonstrate a method to reconstruct the catheter positions pre-treatment, using a 'shift' imaging technique, and perform registration with the treatment plan for verification relative to the prostate.  Methods:   Two oblique 'shift' images were acquired of a phantom containing brachytherapy catheters, representing the patient immediately pre-treatment. Using a back projection approach, the catheter paths were reconstructed in 3D and registered with the planned catheter paths. The robustness of the reconstruction and registration process was investigated as a function of phantom rotation. Catheter displacement detection was performed and compared to known applied displacements.  Results:   Reconstruction of the implant geometry in 3D immediately prior to treatment was achieved. A mean reconstruction uncertainty of 0.8mm was determined for all catheters with a mean registration uncertainty of 0.5mm. A catheter displacement detection threshold of 2.2mm was demonstrated. Catheter displacements were all detected to within 0.5mm of the applied displacements.  Conclusion:   This technique is robust and sensitive to assess catheter displacements throughout the implant volume.

Introduction of rGO as electron mediator greatly facilitated the electron transfer from FeOOH to electrode under visible light, which inhibited the electron-hole recombination to enhance the photo-activity of FeOOH-rGO. Additionally, the bioresponsive release system was controlled via the reaction of target PSA with the aptamer capped glucose-loading mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) to release numerous glucose molecules (as the electron donors) for the amplification of the photocurrent generated from FeOOH-rGO. Thus, more glucose molecules could be released and enhanced photocurrents could be obtained with the increasing PSA concentrations. Experimental results showed that the photocurrents of the PEC sensing platform were linearly dependent on the logarithm of PSA concentrations from 1.0pg/mL to 100ng/mL. Moreover, the PEC sensing system afforded good stability and specificity, and its accuracy matched well with the commercial PSA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The excellent performance of the PEC sensing platform indicated its promising prospect as a useful tool for PSA detection in practical application.""","""['Qian Zhou', 'Youxiu Lin', 'Jian Shu', 'Kangyao Zhang', 'Zhenzhong Yu', 'Dianping Tang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Reduced graphene oxide/BiFeO3 nanohybrids-based signal-on photoelectrochemical sensing system for prostate-specific antigen detection coupling with magnetic microfluidic device.', 'Using reduced graphene oxide-Ca:CdSe nanocomposite to enhance photoelectrochemical activity of gold nanoparticles functionalized tungsten oxide for highly sensitive prostate specific antigen detection.', 'Photoelectrochemical bioanalysis of antibiotics on rGO-Bi2WO6-Au based on branched hybridization chain reaction.', 'Nanomaterial based aptasensing of prostate specific antigen (PSA): Recent progress and challenges in efficient diagnosis of prostate cancer using biomedicine.', 'A review on peptide functionalized graphene derivatives as nanotools for biosensing.', 'A photoelectrochemical sensor for Hg2+ detection with enhanced cathodic photocurrent via BiOI/Bi2S3 photoanode of self-sacrifice.', 'Using Nanomaterials as Excellent Immobilisation Layer for Biosensor Design.', 'Photoelectrochemical sandwich immunoassay of brain glycogen phosphorylase based on methyl orange-sensitized TiO2 nanorods.', 'Advances in Optical Aptasensors for Early Detection and Diagnosis of Various Cancer Types.', 'Au-PDA@SiO2 core-shell nanospheres decorated rGO modified electrode for electrochemical sensing of cefotaxime.']"""

Materials and methods:   Patients eligible for an 18-F choline positron-emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Eligible patients had asymptomatic biochemical recurrence after primary PCa treatment and testosterone levels >50 ng/mL. The number of lesions was counted per scan. Patients with isolated local recurrence (LR) or with ≤3 metastases (with or without LR) were considered to have low-volume disease and patients with >3 metastases to have high-volume disease. Descriptive statistics were used to report recurrences. Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the influence of prognostic variables on the time to developing castration-resistant PCa (CRPC).  Results:   In 208 patients, 625 sites of recurrence were detected in the lymph nodes (N1/M1a: 30%), the bone (18%), the prostate (bed; 11%), viscera (4%), or a combination of any of the previous (37%). In total, 153 patients (74%) had low-volume recurrence and 55 patients (26%) had high-volume recurrence. The 3-year CRPC-free survival rate for the whole cohort was 79% (95% confidence interval 43-55), 88% for low-volume recurrences and 50% for high-volume recurrences (P < 0.001). Longer PSA doubling time at time of recurrence and low-volume disease were associated with a longer time to CRPC.  Conclusions:   Three out of four patients with PCa with a 18-F choline PET-CT-detected recurrence have low-volume disease, potentially amenable to local therapy.

Objective:   In this study we evaluated the patterns of recurrence after RPE in patients with PC, putting a highlight on the differentiation between sites that would have been covered by a standard radiation therapy (RT) field in consensus after the RTOG consensus and others that would have not.  Methods and materials:   Thirty-one out of 83 patients (37%) with high-risk PC were the subject of our study. Information from 68Ga-PSMA-PET imaging was used to individualize treatment plans to include suspicious lesions as well as possibly boost sites with tracer uptake in LN or the prostate bed. For evaluation, 68Ga-PSMA-PET-positive LN were contoured in a patient dataset with a standard lymph drainage (RTOG consensus on CTV definition of pelvic lymph nodes) radiation field depicting color-coded nodes that would have been infield or outfield of that standard lymph drainage field and thereby visualizing typical patterns of failure of a ""blind"" radiation therapy after RPE and LAE.  Results:   Compared to negative conventional imaging (CT/MRI), lesions suspicious for PC were detected in 27/31 cases (87.1%) by 68Ga-PSMA-PET imaging, which resulted in changes to the radiation concept. There were 16/31 patients (51.6%) that received a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to a subarea of the prostate bed (in only three cases this dose escalation would have been planned without the additional knowledge of 68Ga-PSMA-PET imaging) and 18/31 (58.1%) to uncommon (namely presacral, paravesical, pararectal, preacetabular and obturatoric) LN sites. Furthermore, 14 patients (45.2%) had a changed TNM staging result by means of 68Ga-PSMA-PET imaging.

This prospective Australian multicenter study assessed whether 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging affects management intent in patients with primary or recurrent prostate cancer. Methods: Before undertaking 68Ga-PSMA PET imaging, referring medical specialists completed a questionnaire detailing relevant demographic and clinical data as well as their proposed management plan. A separate follow-up questionnaire was completed after the 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan results were available to determine whether the management plan would change. Results: A total of 431 patients with prostate cancer from 4 Australian centers had pre- and post-68Ga-PSMA management plans completed. Scans were obtained for primary staging of intermediate- and high-risk disease in 25% of patients and for restaging/biochemical recurrence in 75% of patients. Overall, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scanning led to a change in planned management in 51% of patients. The impact was greater in the group of patients with biochemical failure after definitive surgery or radiation treatment (62% change in management intent) than in patients undergoing primary staging (21% change).

Selective targeting of p110β could result in successful pathway inhibition while avoiding the on- and off-target effects of pan-PI3K inhibitors. GSK2636771 is a potent, orally bioavailable, adenosine triphosphate-competitive, selective inhibitor of PI3Kβ.Methods: We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antitumor activity of GSK2636771 to define the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). During the dose-selection and dose-escalation stages (parts 1 and 2), patients with PTEN-deficient advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of GSK2636771 (25-500 mg once daily) using a modified 3+3 design to determine the RP2D; tumor type-specific expansion cohorts (part 3) were implemented to further assess tumor responses at the RP2D.Results: A total of 65 patients were enrolled; dose-limiting toxicities were hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia. Adverse events included diarrhea (48%), nausea (40%), and vomiting (31%). Single- and repeat-dose exposure increased generally dose proportionally. GSK2636771 400 mg once daily was the RP2D. Phospho/total AKT ratio decreased with GSK2636771 in tumor and surrogate tissue. A castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patient harboring PIK3CB amplification had a partial response for over a year; an additional 10 patients derived durable (≥24 weeks) clinical benefit, including two other patients with CRPC with PIK3CB alterations (≥34 weeks). GSK2636771 400 mg once daily orally induced sufficient exposure and target inhibition with a manageable safety profile.Conclusions: Genomic aberrations of PIK3CB may be associated with clinical benefit from GSK2636771.

Therefore, we examined the association between extent of coronary atherosclerosis determined by coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and risk of cancer. We conducted a historical population-based cohort study of 28,549 cancer-free patients identified in the Western Denmark Heart Registry. All patients underwent cardiac computed tomography for measurement of CACS for suspected coronary artery disease. The outcome was an incident cancer diagnosis: total, tobacco-related, lung, prostate, breast, and colorectal. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analyses stratified by gender to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for relations between CACS and cancer with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). During follow-up, 455 men and 527 women had a cancer diagnosis. In a multivariable model (reference group: CACS 0), adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for total cancer were as follows: CACS 1 to 99: 1.07 (0.83 to 1.39), CACS 100 to 399: 1.24 (0.94 to 1.63), CACS 400 to 999: 0.88 (0.62 to 1.25), CACS ≥1,000: 0.96 (0.66 to 1.41) in men; and CACS 1 to 99: 0.96 (0.77 to 1.19), CACS 100 to 399: 0.99 (0.75 to 1.31), CACS 400 to 999: 1.11 (0.76 to 1.62), and CACS ≥1,000: 1.16 (0.73 to 1.83) in women. We found no significant association between CACS and the specified outcomes for men or women, except for an increased risk of lung cancer among women with a high CACS. In conclusion, extent of coronary atherosclerosis determined by CACS was not associated with development of total, tobacco-related, lung, prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer.

This study is aimed to study the role of PHF21B in the progression of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blotting analysis were used to determine PHF21B expression in prostate cancer cell lines and clinical specimens. The role of PHF21B in maintaining prostate cancer stem cell-like phenotype was examined by tumor-sphere formation assay and expression levels of stem cell markers. Luciferase reporter assay, western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and ChIP assay were used to determine whether PHF21B activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling by transcriptionally downregulating SFRP1 and SFRP2.  Results:   Our results revealed that PHF21B was markedly upregulated in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. High PHF21B levels predicted poorer recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that overexpression of PHF21B enhanced, while downregulation suppressed, the cancer stem cell-like phenotype in prostate cancer cells. Xenograft tumor model showed that silencing PHF21B decreased the ability of tumorigenicity in vivo. Notably, Wnt/β-catenin signaling was hyperactivated in prostate cancer cells overexpressing PHF21B, and mediated PHF21B-induced cancer stem cell-like phenotype. Furthermore, PHF21B suppressed repressors of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade, including SFRP1 and SFRP2. These results demonstrated that PHF21B constitutively activated wnt/β-catenin signaling by transcriptionally downregulating SFRP1 and SFRP2, which promotes prostate cancer stem cell-like phenotype.  Conclusions:   Our results revealed that PHF21B functions as an oncogene in prostate cancer, and may represent a promising prognostic biomarker and an attractive candidate for target therapy of prostate cancer.""","""['Qiji Li', 'Liping Ye', 'Wei Guo', 'Min Wang', 'Shuai Huang', 'Xinsheng Peng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Upregulation of miR-501-5p activates the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and enhances stem cell-like phenotype in gastric cancer.', 'MiR-1207 overexpression promotes cancer stem cell-like traits in ovarian cancer by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'MiR-744 increases tumorigenicity of pancreatic cancer by activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Roles and regulation of Wnt signaling and beta-catenin in prostate cancer.', 'Revisiting the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in prostate cancer.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'SFRP1 induces a stem cell phenotype in prostate cancer cells.', 'Interaction between prostate cancer stem cells and bone microenvironment regulates prostate cancer bone metastasis and treatment resistance.', 'Deletion of Wild-type p53 Facilitates Bone Metastatic Function by Blocking the AIP4 Mediated Ligand-Induced Degradation of CXCR4.', 'hsa_circ_0003222 accelerates stemness and progression of non-small cell lung cancer by sponging miR-527.']"""

Methods:   Patients received oral enzalutamide 160 mg/day (n = 872) or placebo (n = 845). EQ-5D index and EQ-5D visual analogue scale (EQ-5D VAS) scores were evaluated at baseline, week 13, and every 12 weeks until week 61 due to sample size reduction thereafter.

Results:   With enzalutamide, EQ-5D index and EQ-5D VAS scores declined more slowly versus placebo and time to diverge from full health was prolonged. Average decline in EQ-5D index (-0.042 vs. -0.070; P < .0001) and EQ-5D VAS (-1.3 vs. -4.4; P < .0001) was significantly smaller with enzalutamide. There were significant (P < .05) between-group differences favoring enzalutamide in Pain/Discomfort to week 37, Anxiety/Depression at week 13, and Usual Activities at week 25, but no significant differences for Mobility and Self-care.

As approximately 8% of the world's population is living with T2D, even a slight increase in cancer risk could result in an enormous impact on the number of persons developing cancer. In addition, several glucose lowering drug classes for treating patients with T2D have been associated with a difference in risk of cancer overall, and especially for obesity related cancers. In what way and to what degree cancer risk is modified by the use of different sulfonylureas (SU) is unclear. The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate within-class SU differences in obesity related cancer risk. Secondary aims will be to investigate within-class SU differences in risk for all cancers combined and site-specific cancers separately (i.e. breast, colorectal, prostate, bladder and lung cancer) and to account for duration-response relationships between individual SU use and cancer risk.  Methods:   Patients will be selected from a Dutch primary care cohort of patients with T2D linked with the Dutch Cancer Registration (ZODIAC-NCR). Within this cohort study annually collected clinical data (e.g. blood pressure, weight, HbA1c) and nationwide data on cancer incidence are available. Time-dependent cox proportional hazard analyses will be performed to evaluate SU cancer risk, adjusted for potential confounders.  Discussion:   This study will be the first prospective cohort study investigating within-class SU differences in cancer risk and could contribute to improved decision making regarding the individual drugs within the class of SUs, and possibly improve quality of life and result in an increased cost-effectiveness of healthcare in patients with T2D.

The growth of androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells in mice is inhibited by 3 mg/kg/week melatonin (0.09 mg/mouse/week) delivered by i.p. injections, which is equivalent to a dose of 210 mg/week in humans. The aim of this study is to test an alternative noninvasive delivery route based on transdermal administration of melatonin onto the tumor area followed by cryopass-laser treatment. Two groups of immunodepressed mice were studied, one (n = 10) subjected to 18 cryopass-laser therapy sessions and one (n = 10) subjected to the same treatment without melatonin. These groups were compared with mice treated with i.p.-administered melatonin or vehicle with the same time schedule. We found that cryopass-laser treatment is as efficient as i.p. injections in reducing the growth of LNCaP tumor cells, affecting plasma melatonin and redox balance. Furthermore, both delivery routes share the same effects on the involved biochemical pathway driven by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α. However, cryopass-laser, as used in the present experimental setup, is less efficient than i.p delivery route in increasing the melatonin content and Nrf2 expression in the tumor mass.

The data are usually generated from the same source material (i.e., tumor sample) representing one level of regulation. However, integrating different regulatory levels (i.e., blood) with those from tumor may also reveal important knowledge about the human genetic architecture. To model this multilevel structure, an integrative-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis applying two-stage regression (2SR) was proposed. This approach first regressed tumor gene expression levels with tumor markers and the adjusted residuals from the previous model were then regressed with the germline genotypes measured in blood. Previously, we demonstrated that penalized regression methods in combination with a permutation-based MaxT method (Global-LASSO) is a promising tool to fix some of the challenges that high-throughput omics data analysis imposes. Here, we assessed whether Global-LASSO can also be applied when tumor and blood omics data are integrated. We further compared our strategy with two 2SR-approaches, one using multiple linear regression (2SR-MLR) and other using LASSO (2SR-LASSO). We applied the three models to integrate genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from tumor tissue with blood germline genotypes from 181 individuals with bladder cancer included in the TCGA Consortium. Global-LASSO provided a larger list of eQTLs than the 2SR methods, identified a previously reported eQTLs in prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), and provided further clues on the complexity of APBEC3B loci, with a minimal false-positive rate not achieved by 2SR-MLR.

Survey results identified differences in PCPs belief in the benefit of screening for recommended and non-recommended routine cancer screening, PCPs adherence to screening guidelines for some cancers and physician comfort and patient testing requests related to physician gender for gender sensitive tests. Further, across cancers, screening barriers included patients with multiple health concerns (41%), limited time to discuss screening (36%), and lack of physician financial compensation to discuss screening (23%). The study highlighted the need for more physician education on screening programs, referral criteria, follow-up processes, and screening guidelines. Conferences (73%), self-directed (46%), small group workshops (42%), hospital rounds (41%), and online CME/CPD (39%) were highly preferred (4+5) for learning about cancer screening.

The aim of our study was to translate the English version of MAX-PC into Chinese and evaluate the psychometric properties of it.  Methods:   The study cohort comprised 254 participants. Internal consistency including the Cronbach's alpha coefficient and item-total correlations were used to measure the reliability of the scale. Factor structure was analyzed by exploratory factor analysis and concurrent validity by comparing MAX-PC scores with anxiety subscale scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Divergent validity was assessed by correlating MAX-PC with HADS depression subscale, while discriminant ability by comparing differences in MAX-PC scores between different patient groups.  Results:   The Chinese version of MAX-PC demonstrated good reliability; the Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the total and three subscales (prostate cancer anxiety, PSA anxiety, and fear of recurrence) being 0.94, 0.93, 0.82, and 0.85, respectively. Exploratory factor analysis supported the three-factor structure of the scale established in the original version. Despite the somewhat underperformed divergent validity, the scale demonstrated good concurrent validity with a strong correlation with the HADS anxiety subscale (r = 0.71, p < 0.01). Moreover, discriminant ability was demonstrated by ability to differentiate between disease stages.

Despite significant improvements in the last decade, the treatment of prostate cancer remains unsatisfactory, because a significant fraction of prostate cancers develop resistance to multiple treatments and become incurable. This prompts an urgent need to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of therapy-induced resistance of prostate cancer either in the form of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or transdifferentiated neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). By analyzing micro-RNA expression profiles in a set of patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft tumor lines, we identified miR-100-5p as one of the key molecular components in the initiation and evolution of androgen ablation therapy resistance in prostate cancer. In vitro results showed that miR-100-5p is required for hormone-independent survival and proliferation of prostate cancer cells post androgen ablation.

Among the target compounds, five β-aminomalonates (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3b), one α-aminophosphonate (2c), and one nitroalkyl derivative (2h) exhibited half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in the range of 0.6-8.2 μM. Derivatives 1b, 2b and 2h showed the lowest IC50 values, with 2b being the most potent with values comparable to those of the positive control doxorubicin. On the basis of their IC50 values, derivatives 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 2h, and 3b were selected to evaluate the apoptotic PC-3 cell death at 10 μM by flow cytometry using propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V dual staining. The results indicated that the cytotoxic activity of the tested compounds in PC-3 cells is due to the induction of apoptosis, with 1a and 2h being the most active (55% of early apoptosis induction). Our preliminary SAR study showed that the incorporation of specific malonic esters, dialkyl phosphites and nitro alkanes on scaffolds 1-3 significantly enhanced their cytotoxic properties. Moreover, it appears that the electron donating 7,8-methylenedioxy group allowed derivatives of 2 to exhibit higher cytotoxicity than derivatives of 1 and 3. The present results suggest that derivatives 2b and 2h may be considered as potential lead compounds for the development of new anticancer agents.""","""['Adriana Romo-Pérez', 'Luis Demetrio Miranda', 'Alma D Chávez-Blanco', 'Alfonso Dueñas-González', 'María Del Rayo Camacho-Corona', 'Alejandrina Acosta-Huerta', 'Abraham García']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Pseudocyanides of sanguinarine and chelerythrine and their series of structurally simple analogues as new anticancer lead compounds: Cytotoxic activity, structure-activity relationship and apoptosis induction.', 'Cytotoxic activity, apoptosis induction and structure-activity relationship of 8-OR-2-aryl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2-ium salts as promising anticancer agents.', 'Synthesis, in vitro cytotoxicity and apoptosis inducing study of 2-aryl-3-nitro-2H-chromene derivatives as potent anti-breast cancer agents.', 'Anticancer potential of sanguinarine for various human malignancies.', 'Molecular symmetry: a structural property frequently present in new cytotoxic and proapoptotic drugs.', 'Synthesis and Antileukemia Activity Evaluation of Benzophenanthridine Alkaloid Derivatives.', 'Alkaloids of Dicranostigma franchetianum (Papaveraceae) and Berberine Derivatives as a New Class of Antimycobacterial Agents.', 'Synthesis, Bacteriostatic and Anticancer Activity of Novel Phenanthridines Structurally Similar to Benzocphenanthridine Alkaloids.']"""

This study was aimed at identifying the most reliable and reproducible method of obtaining sufficient high-quality nucleic acids from FFPE tissues. We compared the yield and quality of nucleic acids from 0.6-mm FFPE prostate tissue cores across 16 DNA and RNA extraction protocols, using 14 commercially available kits. Nucleic acid yield was determined by fluorometry, and quality was determined by spectrophotometry. All protocols yielded nucleic acids in quantities that are compatible with downstream molecular applications. However, the protocols varied widely in the quality of the extracted RNA and DNA. Four RNA and five DNA extraction protocols, including protocols from two kits for dual-extraction of RNA and DNA from the same tissue source, were prioritized for further quality assessment based on the yield and purity of their products. Specifically, their compatibility with downstream reactions was assessed using both NanoString nCounter gene expression assays and reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR for RNA, and methylation-specific PCR assays for DNA.

Methods:   In total, 972 patients underwent RT for localized prostate cancer, to a total dose of 70 Gy or 80 Gy, using two different fractionations (2 Gy or 2.5 Gy/day), by means of several RT techniques (3D conformal RT [3DCRT], intensity-modulated RT [IMRT], or image-guided RT [IGRT]). Multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of acute and late rectal toxicity. A nomogram was generated based on the logistic regression model used to predict the 3-year rectal toxicity risk, with its accuracy assessed by dividing the cohort into training and validation subgroups.  Results:   Mean follow-up for the entire cohort was 62 months, ranging from 6 to 235. The rate of acute Grade ≥2 rectal toxicity was 22.2%, decreasing when combining IMRT and IGRT, compared to 3DCRT (RR = 0.4, 95%CI: 0.3-0.6, p<0.01). The 5-year Grade ≥2 risks for rectal bleeding, urgency/tenesmus, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence were 9.9%, 4.5%, 2.8%, and 0.4%, respectively. The 3-year Grade ≥2 risk for overall rectal toxicity increased with total dose (p<0.01, RR = 1.1, 95%CI: 1.0-1.1) and dose per fraction (2Gy vs. 2.5Gy) (p = 0.03, RR = 3.3, 95%CI: 1.1-10.0), and decreased when combining IMRT and IGRT (RR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8, p<0.01). Based on these three parameters, a nomogram was generated.  Conclusions:   Dose escalation and moderate hypofractionation increase late rectal toxicity. IMRT combined with IGRT markedly decreases acute and late rectal toxicity. Performing combined IMRT and IGRT can thus be envisaged for dose escalation and moderate hypofractionation.

More recently, reimbursement for IMRT in the office setting (generally representing freestanding facilities owned by physicians) has been declining. The aim of the study was to examine trends in IMRT use and related payments in the office versus hospital outpatient setting over time.In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 66,967 men aged 66 years or older, with newly diagnosed prostate cancer from 2007 through 2012 were identified in a 20% national sample of Medicare claims. IMRT use in the office versus hospital outpatient setting was examined over time, adjusted for patient characteristics using multivariable logistic regression models. Mean reimbursement for IMRT treatments and total IMRT-related payments were plotted by year.IMRT use increased from 28.6% to 38.0% of newly diagnosed men with prostate cancer over the study period, exclusively related to growth in the office setting. In particular, use in the office setting increased from 13.2% in 2007 to 22.1%, whereas use in the hospital outpatient setting remained essentially steady throughout the period around 15%. During the same period mean reimbursement for IMRT in the office setting declined from $504 per individual radiation treatment to $381, whereas it increased from $283 to $380 in the hospital outpatient setting. However, total IMRT-related payments in the office setting increased through 2011 due to increased utilization, falling only in 2012 (to $35.7 million from $48.3 million in 2011) related both to continued declines in reimbursement and a large reduction in new cases of prostate cancer.In conclusion, use of IMRT in the physician office setting in men diagnosed with prostate cancer has continued to increase in the face of declining reimbursement.

AZD1152-HQPA, as an inhibitor of Aurora-B, has recently emerged as a promising agent for cancer treatment. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of AZD1152-HQPA on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial function in PCa. We used AZD1152-HQPA (Barasertib), a highly potent and selective inhibitor of Aurora-B kinase. The effects of AZD1152-HQPA on cell viability, DNA content, cell morphology, and ROS production were studied in the androgen-independent PC-3 PCa cell line. Moreover, the mitochondrial copy number and the expression of genes involved in cell survival and cancer stem cell maintenance were investigated. We found that AZD1152-HQPA treatment induced defective cell survival, polyploidy, micronuclei formation, cell enlargement, and cell death by significant overexpression of p73, p21 and downregulation of cell cycle-regulatory genes in a drug concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, AZD1152 treatment led to an excessive ROS generation and an increase in the mitochondrial copy number not only in PC-3 but also in several other malignant cells. AZD1152 treatment also led to downregulation of genes involved in the maintenance of cancer stem cells. Our results showed a functional relationship between the aurora kinase inhibition, an increase in mitochondrial copy number, and ROS generation in therapeutic modalities of cancer.

Cancer related fatigue can be reduced by exercise interventions that may concurrently increase muscle mass. We hypothesized that low muscle mass is directly related to higher CRF.  Methods:   A total of 233 patients with advanced cancer starting palliative chemotherapy for lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer were studied. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as the patient's muscle mass on level L3 or T4 of a computed tomography scan, adjusted for height. Fatigue was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-fatigue questionnaire (cut-off for fatigue <34). Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to study the association between SMI and CRF adjusting for relevant confounders.  Results:   In this group of patients with advanced cancer, the median fatigue score was 36 (interquartile range 26-44). A higher SMI on level L3 was significantly associated with less CRF for men (B 0.447, P 0.004) but not for women (B - 0.401, P 0.090). No association between SMI on level T4 and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-fatigue score was found (n = 82).  Conclusions:   The association between SMI and CRF may lead to the suggestion that male patients may be able to reduce fatigue by exercise interventions aiming at an increased muscle mass. In women with advanced cancer, CRF is more influenced by other causes, because it is not significantly related to muscle mass.

The aim of this study was to analyze how 20-HETE impacts cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Incubation of the human androgen-sensitive cells (LNCaP) with 1-10 μM HET0016 (a selective inhibitor of 20-HETE synthesis) reduced cell viability by 49*-64%* (*p < 0.05 vs. control). This was explained by a reduction in cell proliferation (vehicle, 46 ± 3%; 1 μM, 23 ± 3%*; 10 μM, 28 ± 3%*) and by an increase in apoptosis (vehicle, 2.1 ± 0%; 1 μM, 16 ± 4%*; 10 μM, 31 ± 3%*). Furthermore, the increase in LNCaP cell viability induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 0.1 nM) was abrogated by 30*-42%* by 1-10 μM HET0016. Incubation with 20-HETE (5-1000 nM) increased LNCaP cell viability up to 50%*, together with a 70%* reduction in apoptosis. PC-3 (androgen-insensitive) cell viability was not affected by either HET0016 or 20-HETE. In LNCaP cells, HET0016 (10 μM) diminished the expression of androgen receptors (AR): messenger RNA (mRNA) (40%*) and protein (50%*). DHT (10 nM) augmented CYP4F2 protein expression (1.9-fold*) and 20-HETE levels (50%*). Oppositely, enzalutamide (AR antagonist) reduced CYP4F2 mRNA and protein expressions by 30 and 25%, respectively. Thus, intracellular availability of 20-HETE is necessary to sustain LNCaP cell viability. 20-HETE may act as a signaling molecule in the pathways involved in LNCaP cell viability upon stimulation of the AR. This effect may be partially attributed to its role on securing normal AR expression levels that in turn contribute to maintain intracellular levels of 20-HETE.""","""['Cecilia Colombero', 'Daniela Papademetrio', 'Paula Sacca', 'Eduardo Mormandi', 'Elida Alvarez', 'Susana Nowicki']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['20-HETE/GPR75 pairing modulates the expression and transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'Kaempferol Promotes Apoptosis While Inhibiting Cell Proliferation via Androgen-Dependent Pathway and Suppressing Vasculogenic Mimicry and Invasion in Prostate Cancer.', 'CA916798 affects growth and metastasis of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells.', '6-(3,4-Dihydro-1H-isoquinoline-2-yl)-N-(6-methoxypyridine-2-yl) nicotinamide-26 (DIMN-26) decreases cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis and downregulation of androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of 20-HETE in androgen-mediated hypertension.', 'CYP1B1 inhibits ferroptosis and induces anti-PD-1 resistance by degrading ACSL4 in colorectal cancer.', 'Genetic polymorphisms in CYP4F2 may be associated with lung cancer risk among females and no-smoking Chinese population.', 'New inhibitor targeting Acyl-CoA synthetase 4 reduces breast and prostate tumor growth, therapeutic resistance and steroidogenesis.', 'CYP4F2 and CYP3A5 gene polymorphisms and lung cancer in Chinese Han population.', 'GPR75 receptor mediates 20-HETE-signaling and metastatic features of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells.']"""

One of the challenges for small-molecule PSMA inhibitors with respect to delivering therapeutic payloads is their rapid renal clearance. In order to overcome this pharmacokinetic challenge, we outfitted a 177Lu-labeled phosphoramidate-based PSMA inhibitor (CTT1298) with an albumin-binding motif (CTT1403) and compared its in vivo performance with that of an analogous compound lacking the albumin-binding motif (CTT1401). The radiolabeling of CTT1401 and CTT1403 was achieved using click chemistry to connect 177Lu-DOTA-N3 to the dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-bearing CTT1298 inhibitor cores. A direct comparison in vitro and in vivo performance was made for CTT1401 and CTT1403; the specificity and efficacy by means of cellular uptake and internalization, biodistribution, and therapeutic efficacy were determined for both compounds. While both compounds displayed excellent uptake and rapid internalization in PSMA+ PC3-PIP cells, the albumin binding moiety in CTT1403 conferred clear advantages to the PSMA-inhibitor scaffold including increased circulating half-life and prostate tumor uptake that continued to increase up to 168 h post-injection.

Unfortunately, AR dysfunction means that resistance to enzalutamide will eventually develop. Thus, novel agents are urgently needed to treat this devastating disease. Triptolide (TPL), a key active compound extracted from the Chinese herb Thunder God Vine (Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F.), possesses anti-cancer activity in human prostate cancer cells. However, the effects of TPL against CRPC cells and the underlying mechanism of any such effect are unknown. In this study, we found that TPL at low dose inhibits the transactivation activity of both full-length and truncated AR without changing their protein levels. Interestingly, TPL inhibits phosphorylation of AR and its CRPC-associated variant AR-V7 at Ser515 through XPB/CDK7. As a result, TPL suppresses the binding of AR to promoter regions in AR target genes along with reduced TFIIH and RNA Pol II recruitment. Moreover, TPL at low dose reduces the viability of prostate cancer cells expressing AR or AR-Vs. Low-dose TPL also shows a synergistic effect with enzalutamide to inhibit CRPC cell survival in vitro, and enhances the anti-cancer effect of enzalutamide on CRPC xenografts with minimal side effects. Taken together, our data demonstrate that TPL targets the transactivation activity of both full-length and truncated ARs. Our results also suggest that TPL is a potential drug for CRPC, and can be used in combination with enzalutamide to treat CRPC.""","""['Yangyang Han', 'Weiwei Huang', 'Jiakuan Liu', 'Dandan Liu', 'Yangyan Cui', 'Ruimin Huang', 'Jun Yan', 'Ming Lei']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The CDK7 inhibitor CT7001 (Samuraciclib) targets proliferation pathways to inhibit advanced prostate cancer.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Utilizing mixture design response surface methodology to determine effective combinations of plant derived compounds as prostate cancer treatments.', 'Synergistic effects of natural products in combination with anticancer agents in prostate cancer: A scoping review.', 'MicroRNA-375 is a therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer through the PTPN4/STAT3 axis.']"""

Results: Comparable levels of radiosensitisation were observed in both phantoms and cells at kilovoltage ranges of x-ray energies (slightly higher in vitro). Significant radiosensitisation (~67 %) of control was also noted in cells at megavoltage energies (commonly used in radiotherapy), compared to negligible levels detected by phantoms. This difference is attributed to biochemical effects, specifically the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which are only manifested in aqueous environments of cells and are non-existent in case of phantoms.

In this retrospective investigation, the dimensions, volume, localization, and SUVmax of nodes identified by 68Ga-PSMA were correlated to their Gleason score (GS) at diagnosis. Methods: All PET/CT images were acquired 60 ± 10 min after intravenous injection of 68Ga-PSMA (mean dose, 176 MBq). In 147 prostate cancer patients (mean age, 68 y; range, 44-87 y) with prostate-specific antigen relapse (mean prostate-specific antigen level, 5 ng/mL; range, 0.25-294 ng/mL), 362 68Ga-PSMA PET-positive lymph nodes (LNs) were identified. These patients were classified on the basis of their histopathology at primary diagnosis into either low- (GS ≤ 6, well differentiated), intermediate- (GS = 7, moderately differentiated), or high-GS cohorts (GS ≥ 8, poorly differentiated prostate cancer). Using semiautomated LN segmentation software (Fraunhofer MEVIS), we measured node volume and short-axis dimensions (SADs) and long-axis dimensions based on CT and compared with the SUVmax Nodes demonstrating uptake of 68Ga-PSMA with an SUVmax of 2.0 or more were considered PSMA-positive, and nodes with an SAD of 8 mm or more were considered positive by morphologic criteria. Results: Mean SUVmax was 13.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.9-16.1), 12.4 (95% CI, 9.9-14.9), and 17.8 (95% CI, 15.4-20.3) within the low-, intermediate-, and high-GS groups, respectively. The morphologic assessment of the 68Ga-PSMA-positive LN demonstrated that the low-GS cohort presented with smaller 68Ga-PSMA-positive LNs (mean SAD, 7.7 mm; n = 113), followed by intermediate- (mean SAD, 9.4 mm; n = 122) and high-GS cohorts (mean SAD, 9.5 mm; n = 127). On the basis of the CT morphology criteria, only 34% of low-GS patients, 56% of intermediate-GS patients, and 53% of high-GS patients were considered CT positive. Overall, 68Ga-PSMA imaging led to a reclassification of stage in 90 patients (61%) from cN0 to cN1 over CT. Conclusion:68Ga-PSMA PET is a promising modality in biochemical recurrent prostate cancer patients for N staging.

However, little is known about the overall shared heritability across cancers. Quantifying the extent to which two distinct cancers share genetic origin will give insights to shared biological mechanisms underlying cancer and inform design for future genetic association studies.Methods: In this study, we estimated the pair-wise genetic correlation between six cancer types (breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate) using cancer-specific GWAS summary statistics data based on 66,958 case and 70,665 control subjects of European ancestry. We also estimated genetic correlations between cancers and 14 noncancer diseases and traits.Results: After adjusting for 15 pair-wise genetic correlation tests between cancers, we found significant (P < 0.003) genetic correlations between pancreatic and colorectal cancer (rg = 0.55, P = 0.003), lung and colorectal cancer (rg = 0.31, P = 0.001). We also found suggestive genetic correlations between lung and breast cancer (rg = 0.27, P = 0.009), and colorectal and breast cancer (rg = 0.22, P = 0.01). In contrast, we found no evidence that prostate cancer shared an appreciable proportion of heritability with other cancers. After adjusting for 84 tests studying genetic correlations between cancer types and other traits (Bonferroni-corrected P value: 0.0006), only the genetic correlation between lung cancer and smoking remained significant (rg = 0.41, P = 1.03 × 10-6). We also observed nominally significant genetic correlations between body mass index and all cancers except ovarian cancer.Conclusions: Our results highlight novel genetic correlations and lend support to previous observational studies that have observed links between cancers and risk factors.Impact: This study demonstrates modest genetic correlations between cancers; in particular, breast, colorectal, and lung cancer share some degree of genetic basis.

Materials and methods:   Patients with prior negative biopsies underwent prostatic multiparametric-MRI that was scored using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) classification. All underwent both repeated TRUS-bx and mp-MRI-bx using image fusion of any PI-RADS ≥3 lesion. Biopsy results from TRUS-bx, mp-MRI-bx, and the combination were compared.  Results:   PCa was detected in 89 out of 206 (43%) patients. Of these, 64 (31%) and 74 (36%) patients were detected using mp-MRI-bx and TRUS-bx, respectively. Overall, mp-MRI-bx detected fewer patients with low-grade (Gleason score [GS] 3 + 3) cancers (14/64 vs. 41/74) and more patients with intermediate/high-grade cancers (GS ≥3 + 4) (50/64 vs. 33/74) using fewer biopsy cores compared with TRUS-bx (p < 0.001). Using an ""MRI-targeted-only"" approach in men with PI-RADS ≥3 lesions reduced the number of men requiring repeated biopsies by 50%, decreased low-grade cancer diagnoses by 66%, and increased intermediate/high-grade cancer diagnoses by 52%.

We propose a label- and reagent-free electrochemical method based on chronopotentiometric stripping (CPS) analysis and a hanging mercury drop electrode for the detection of interaction of sialylated protein biomarker a prostate specific antigen (PSA) with two important lectins: Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA). Incubation of PSA-modified electrode with specific SNA lectin resulted in an increase of CPS peak H of the complex as compared to this peak of individual PSA. By adjusting polarization current and temperature, PSA-MAA interaction can be either eliminated or distinguished from the more abundant PSA-SNA complex.

After radical prostatectomy (RP), nearly 30% of men develop clinical recurrence with high serum prostate-specific antigen levels. An important challenge in PCa research is to identify effective predictors of tumor recurrence. The molecular alterations in microRNAs are associated with PCa initiation and progression. Several miRNA microarray studies have been conducted in recurrence PCa, but the results vary among different studies.  Methods:   We conducted a meta-analysis of 6 available miRNA expression datasets to identify a panel of co-deregulated miRNA genes and overlapping biological processes. The meta-analysis was performed using the 'MetaDE' package, based on combined P-value approaches (adaptive weight and Fisher's methods), in R version 3.3.1.  Results:   Meta-analysis of six miRNA datasets revealed miR-125A, miR-199A-3P, miR-28-5P, miR-301B, miR-324-5P, miR-361-5P, miR-363*, miR-449A, miR-484, miR-498, miR-579, miR-637, miR-720, miR-874 and miR-98 are commonly upregulated miRNA genes, while miR-1, miR-133A, miR-133B, miR-137, miR-221, miR-340, miR-370, miR-449B, miR-489, miR-492, miR-496, miR-541, miR-572, miR-583, miR-606, miR-624, miR-636, miR-639, miR-661, miR-760, miR-890, and miR-939 are commonly downregulated miRNA genes in recurrent PCa samples in comparison to non-recurrent PCa samples. The network-based analysis showed that some of these miRNAs have an established prognostic significance in other cancers and can be actively involved in tumor growth. Gene ontology enrichment revealed many target genes of co-deregulated miRNAs are involved in ""regulation of epithelial cell proliferation"" and ""tissue morphogenesis"". Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that these miRNAs regulate cancer pathways. The PPI hub proteins analysis identified CTNNB1 as the most highly ranked hub protein. Besides, common pathway analysis showed that TCF3, MAX, MYC, CYP26A1, and SREBF1 significantly interact with those DE miRNA genes. The identified genes have been known as tumor suppressors and biomarkers which are closely related to several cancer types, such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer, PCa, gastric, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Additionally, it was shown that the combination of DE miRNAs can assist in the more specific detection of the PCa and prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR).

CHDs govern the cellular machinery's access to DNA, thereby playing critical roles in various cellular processes including transcription, proliferation, and DNA damage repair. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that mutation and dysregulation of CHDs are implicated in the pathogenesis of developmental disorders and cancer. However, we know little about genomic and transcriptomic alterations and the clinical significance of most CHDs in human cancer. We used TCGA and METABRIC datasets to perform integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses of nine CHD genes in more than 10 000 primary cancer specimens from 32 tumor types, focusing on breast cancers. We identified associations among recurrent copy number alteration, gene expression, clinicopathological features, and patient survival. We found that CHD7 was the most commonly gained/amplified and mutated, whereas CHD3 was the most deleted across the majority of tumor types, including breast cancer. Overexpression of CHD7 was more prevalent in aggressive subtypes of breast cancer and was significantly correlated with high tumor grade and poor prognosis. CHD7 is required to maintain open, accessible chromatin, thus providing fine-tuning of transcriptional regulation of certain classes of genes. We found that CHD7 expression was positively correlated with a small subset of classical oncogenes, notably NRAS, in breast cancer. Knockdown of CHD7 inhibits cell proliferation and decreases gene expression of several CHD7 targets, including NRAS, in breast cancer cell lines. Thus, our results demonstrate the oncogenic potential of CHD7 and its association with poor prognostic parameters in human cancer.""","""['Xiaofang Chu', 'Xuhui Guo', 'Yuanyuan Jiang', 'Huimei Yu', 'Lanxin Liu', 'Wenqi Shan', 'Zeng-Quan Yang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['The Chromodomain Helicase DNA-Binding Chromatin Remodelers: Family Traits that Protect from and Promote Cancer.', 'Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis for pinpointing recurrent alterations of plant homeodomain genes and their clinical significance in breast cancer.', 'An integrated genomic analysis of Tudor domain-containing proteins identifies PHD finger protein 20-like 1 (PHF20L1) as a candidate oncogene in breast cancer.', 'Integrated analysis of genes encoding ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers identifies CHD7 as a potential target for colorectal cancer therapy.', 'Mutation update on the CHD7 gene involved in CHARGE syndrome.', 'Targeting Chromatin-Remodeling Factors in Cancer Cells: Promising Molecules in Cancer Therapy.', 'The CHARGE syndrome ortholog CHD-7 regulates TGF-β pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans.', 'Global Histone H3 Lysine 4 Trimethylation (H3K4me3) Landscape Changes in Response to TGFβ.', 'Semaphorin Regulation by the Chromatin Remodeler CHD7: An Emerging Genetic Interaction Shaping Neural Cells and Neural Crest in Development and Cancer.', 'BRG1 knockdown inhibits proliferation through multiple cellular pathways in prostate cancer.']"""

However, the low yield of the Ge-68/Ga-68 from which Gallium-68 is obtained and fewer installed PET/CT systems compared to the SPECT imaging systems may limit its availability. We, therefore, evaluated in a head-to-head comparison, the diagnostic sensitivity of Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT and Tc-99m PSMA SPECT/CT in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 14 patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer were prospectively recruited to undergo Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT and Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT. The mean age of patients was 67.21 ± 8.15 years and the median PSA level was 45.18 ng/mL (range = 1.51-687 ng/mL). SUVmax of all lesions and the size of lymph nodes with PSMA avidity on Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT were determined. Proportions of these lesions detected on Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT read independent of PET/CT findings were determined.  Results:   A total of 46 lesions were seen on Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT localized to the prostate (n = 10), lymph nodes (n = 24), and bones (n = 12). Of these, Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT detected 36 lesions: Prostate = 10/10 (100%), lymph nodes = 15/24 (62.5%), and bones = 11/12 (91.7%) with an overall sensitivity of 78.3%. Lesions detected on Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT were bigger in size (P < 0.001) and had higher SUVmax (P < 0.001) as measured on Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT compared to those lesions that were not detected. All lymph nodes greater than 10 mm in size were detected while only 28% of nodes less than 10 mm were detected by Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT. In a univariate analysis, Lymph node size (P = 0.033) and the SUVmax of all lesions (P = 0.007) were significant predictors of lesion detection on Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT.  Conclusion:   Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA may be a useful in imaging of prostate cancer although with a lower sensitivity for lesion detection compared to Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT. Its use is recommended when Ga-68 PSMA is not readily available, in planning radio-guided surgery or the patient is being considered for radio-ligand therapy with Lu-177 PSMA.

Fifteen prostate cancer patients (67.6 Gy/26 Fr), four head and neck cancer patient (66 Gy/33 Fr), and four esophagus cancer patients (60 Gy/30 Fr) treated with VMAT were studied. First, ArcCHECK measurement was performed on all plans; simultaneously, the Varian dynalog data sets that contained the actual delivered parameters (leaf positions, gantry angles, and cumulative MUs) were acquired from the Linac control system. Thereafter, the delivered 3D patient dose was reconstructed by 3DVH software (two different calculating modes were used: High Sensitivity (3DVH-HS) and Normal Sensitivity (3DVH-NS)) and in-house DBDR system. We evaluated the differences between the TPS-calculated dose and the reconstructed dose using 3D gamma passing rates and DVH dose index analysis. The average 3D gamma passing rates (3%/3 mm) between the TPS-calculated dose and the reconstructed dose were 99.1 ± 0.6%, 99.7 ± 0.3%, and 100.0 ± 0.1% for 3DVH-HS, 3DVH-NS, and DBDR, respectively.

For the head and neck and esophagus cases, the dose difference to the TPS-calculated dose caused by an effect of heterogeneity was more apparent under the 3DVH dose reconstruction than the DBDR.

Screening services were available in the 14 countries for cervical, in 12 countries for breast and in 11 for colorectal cancer. However, only four countries had screening policies. In addition, screening guidelines were available for cervical cancer in nine countries, in one country for breast and in none for colorectal cancer. Selected tobacco control policies were present in the 14 countries and immunization policies for human papillomavirus (HPV) in 13. Treatment services included chemotherapy in 10 countries and radiotherapy in six. Nine countries had palliative care services for patients with advanced disease.

Materials and methods:   Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 141 patients who underwent bilateral, nerve-sparing, robot-assisted RP for clinically localized prostate cancer (clinically T2N0M0 on magnetic resonance imaging) and were evaluated at least 12 months after surgery.

Results:   Of 141 patients, 36 patients (25.5%) had no preoperative potency (group 1), 66 patients (46.8%) recovered potency (group 2), and 39 patients (27.7%) did not recover potency (group 3). Although the mean age of the entire cohort was 65.4 years, the mean age of group 1 was greater than groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.001). The NVB area of group 2 was larger than those of groups 1 and 3 (P = 0.001). Potency evaluations involved 105 patients (74.5%; groups 2 and 3), and patients with pre-existing erectile dysfunction were excluded. The median time to potency recovery was 3.0 months after surgery. The multivariable analysis revealed that the NVB area was the only significant factor predictive of potency recovery.

The A/B steroid ring (Δ5,3β-hydroxyl) structure of galeterone is identical to that of cholesterol, which makes endogenous steroids with the same structure (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnenolone) substrates for the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD). We found that galeterone is metabolized by 3βHSD to Δ4-galeterone (D4G), which is further converted by steroid-5α-reductase (SRD5A) to 3-keto-5α-galeterone (5αG), 3α-OH-5α-galeterone, and 3β-OH-5α-galeterone; in vivo it is also converted to the three corresponding 5β-reduced metabolites. D4G inhibits steroidogenesis and suppresses AR protein stability, AR target gene expression, and xenograft growth comparably with galeterone, and further conversion by SRD5A leads to loss of several activities that inhibit the androgen axis that may compromise clinical efficacy.

Here we report the results of a pilot study comparing a combined ultrasound and fluoroscopy-based seed localization method (iRUF) to standard ultrasound-based dosimetry (USD).  Material and methods:   Eighty patients undergoing permanent Pd-103 seed implantation for prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled. Seed implantation was performed using standard USD for intraoperative dose tracking. Upon implant completion, six X-ray images were intraoperatively acquired using a mobile C-arm and transverse ultrasound images of the implanted prostate were also acquired. Three-dimensional seed locations were reconstructed from X-ray images and registered to the ultrasound for iRUF dosimetry. Day 1 CT/MRI scans were performed for post-implant dosimetry. Prostate and urethral dosimetric parameters were separately calculated for analysis on iRUF, USD, and CT/MRI data sets. Differences and similarities between dosimetric values measured by iRUF, USD, and CT/MRI were assessed based on root mean squared differences, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Results:   Data from 66 eligible patients were analyzed. Compared to CT/MRI, iRUF dosimetry showed higher correlation with overall ICC of 0.42 (0.01 for USD) and significantly smaller root mean squared differences (overall 16.5 vs 21.5 for iRUF and USD) than USD for all prostate and urethral dosimetric parameters examined. USD demonstrated a tendency to overestimate dose to the prostate when compared to iRUF.  Conclusions:   iRUF approximated post-implant CT/MRI prostate and urethral dosimetry to a greater degree than USD.

We then examined which groups were most suited for either prostate seed brachytherapy (PB) or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).  Materials and methods:   We selected patients with D'Amico intermediate-risk prostate cancer who were treated exclusively with either PB or EBRT. Patients were excluded if they had received androgen deprivation therapy in combination with EBRT or a follow up of < 30 months without recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare groups.  Results:   Our sample consisted of 475 patients treated from July 2002-September 2013. Median follow up for patients without biochemical failure (BF) was 56 months (interquartile range 44-78); 222 patients (47%) were treated with PB exclusively (D90 interquartile range 145-176 Gy) and 253 (53%) with EBRT exclusively (dose interquartile range 76-80 Gy). The rate of BF was significantly lower in patients treated with PB (5.4%) than in patients treated with EBRT (14.2%) (p = 0.036, log-rank test). Upon univariate analysis, significant predictors of BF included the number of unfavorable intermediate-risk factors (0, 1, 2, 3) (p = 0.024) as well as the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score (p = 0.002).

Current technological solutions fail to close this safety gap. In response, we aim to demonstrate a novel method to identify common vulnerabilities across clinics and generate attributes for context-flexible population-level monitoring solutions for widespread implementation to improve quality.  Methods:   Based on interviews with staff in otolaryngology, pulmonary, urology, breast, and gastroenterology clinics at a large urban publicly funded health system, we applied journey mapping to co-develop a visual representation of how patients are monitored for high-risk conditions. Using a National Academies framework and context-sensitivity theory, we identified common systems vulnerabilities and developed preliminary concepts for improving the robustness for monitoring patients with high-risk conditions (""design seeds"" for potential solutions). Finally, we conducted a face validity and prioritization assessment of the design seeds with the original interviewees.  Results:   We identified five high-risk situations for potentially consequential diagnostic delays arising from suboptimal patient monitoring. All situations related to detection of cancer (head and neck, lung, prostate, breast, and colorectal). With clinic participants we created 5 journey maps, each representing specialty clinic workflow directed at evidence-based monitoring. System vulnerabilities common to the different clinics included challenges with: data systems, communications handoffs, population-level tracking, and patient activities. Clinic staff ranked 13 design seeds (e.g., keep patient list up to date, use triggered notifications) addressing these vulnerabilities. Each design seed has unique evaluation criteria for the usefulness of potential solutions developed from the seed.  Conclusions:   We identified and ranked 13 design seeds that characterize situations that clinicians described 'wake them up at night', and thus could reduce their anxiety, save time, and improve monitoring of high-risk patients. We anticipate that the design seed approach promotes robust and context-sensitive solutions to safety and quality problems because it provides a human-centered link between the experienced problem and various solutions that can be tested for viability. The study also demonstrates a novel integration of industrial and human factors methods (journey mapping, process tracing and design seeds) linked to implementation theory for use in designing interventions that anticipate and reduce implementation challenges.""","""['Kathryn M McDonald', 'George Su', 'Sarah Lisker', 'Emily S Patterson', 'Urmimala Sarkar']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Implement Sci""","""['Clinician-identified problems and solutions for delayed diagnosis in primary care: a PRIORITIZE study.', 'Assessment of Health Information Technology-Related Outpatient Diagnostic Delays in the US Veterans Affairs Health Care System: A Qualitative Study of Aggregated Root Cause Analysis Data.', 'The Effectiveness of Integrated Care Pathways for Adults and Children in Health Care Settings: A Systematic Review.', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis with Hologic 3D Mammography Selenia Dimensions System for Use in Breast Cancer Screening: A Single Technology Assessment Internet.', 'Avoiding and identifying errors in health technology assessment models: qualitative study and methodological review.', 'Training the next generation of learning health system scientists.', 'Customized registry tool for tracking adherence to clinical guidelines for head and neck cancers: protocol for a pilot study.', 'Reducing delays to diagnosis in ambulatory care settings: A macrocognition perspective.', 'An electronic registry to improve adherence to active surveillance monitoring among men with prostate cancer at a safety-net hospital: protocol for a pilot study.', ""Accurate Measurement In California's Safety-Net Health Systems Has Gaps And Barriers.""]"""

The complexes were screened for their anticancer potential in vitro on ten human cancer cell lines, concretely breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), osteosarcoma (HOS), lung carcinoma (A549), cervix epithelioid carcinoma (HeLa), malignant melanoma (G-361), prostate carcinoma (22Rv1, PC-3), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), ovarian carcinoma (A2780) and cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma (A2780R). The complexes exhibited significant wide-spectrum anticancer activity in vitro against all the employed cell lines, with IC50≈0.5-24.0μM. Very good correlation between the lipophilicity parameter log P and IC50 values of anticancer activity in vitro were obtained by simple QSAR analysis.

Tumour-associated genomic mutations of the LRP1 gene are described, but nothing is known about cancer-associated expression of LRP1 splice variants Therefore, the focus of this study was on an annotated truncated LRP1 splice variant (BC072015.1; NCBI GenBank), referred to as smLRP1, which was initially identified in prostate and lung carcinoma.  Methods:   Using PCR and quantitative PCR, the expression of LRP1 and smLRP1 in different human tissues and tumour cell lines was screened and compared on tumour biopsies of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Using a recently developed anti-smLRP1 antibody, the expression of the putative LRP1 protein isoform in tumour cell lines in Western blot and immunofluorescence staining was further investigated.  Results:   The alternative transcript smLRP1 is ubiquitously expressed in 12 human cell lines of different origin and 22 tissues which is similar to LRP1. A shift in expression of smLRP1 relative to LRP1 towards smLRP1 was observed in most tumour cell lines compared to healthy tissue. The expression of LRP1 as well as smLRP1 is decreased in HNSCC cell lines in comparison to healthy mucosa. In vitro results were checked using primary HNSCC. Furthermore, the expression of the protein isoform smLRP1 (32 kDa) was confirmed in human tumour cell lines.  Conclusions:   Similar to LRP1, the truncated splice variant smLRP1 is ubiquitously expressed in healthy human tissues, but altered in tumours pointing to a potential role of smLRP1 in cancer. Comparative results suggest a shift in expression in favour of smLRP1 in tumour cells that warrant further evaluation.

TRAIL resistance in cancers is associated with aberrant expression of the key components of the apoptotic program. However, how these components are regulated at the epigenetic level is not understood. In this study, we investigated novel epigenetic mechanisms regulating TRAIL response in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells by a short-hairpin RNA loss-of-function screen. We interrogated 48 genes in DNA and histone modification pathways and identified KDM2B, an H3K36-specific demethylase, as a novel regulator of TRAIL response. Accordingly, silencing of KDM2B significantly enhanced TRAIL sensitivity, the activation of caspase-8, -3 and -7 and PARP cleavage. KDM2B knockdown also accelerated the apoptosis, as revealed by live-cell imaging experiments. To decipher the downstream molecular pathways regulated by KDM2B, levels of apoptosis-related genes were examined by RNA-sequencing upon KDM2B loss, which revealed derepression of proapoptotic genes Harakiri (HRK), caspase-7 and death receptor 4 (DR4) and repression of antiapoptotic genes. The apoptosis phenotype was partly dependent on HRK upregulation, as HRK knockdown significantly abrogated the sensitization. KDM2B-silenced tumors exhibited slower growth in vivo.

To the best of our knowledge a systematic assessment of bone and mineral abnormalities has not been performed in prostatic cancer patients consecutively enrolled.  Methods:   This study was therefore carried out to investigate changes of skeletal and mineral metabolism in patients with prostate cancer (n = 69). A population of patients with cancer of various origin was also investigated as a control group (n = 53), since a comparison with non-prostate cancer patients has not been previously reported.  Results:   In the prostatic cancer group, one patient had extremely high values of C-terminal Fibroblast Growth Factor 23, low values of tubular reabsorption of phosphate and very high values of bone alkaline phosphatase, suggesting the diagnosis of oncogenic osteomalacia. We found nine patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in the group of prostate cancer vs. only one in cancer patients group (p < 0.026). We stratified the population on the basis of Gleason score, prostate specific antigen and hormonal therapy. Using a generalized linear model with a logit link to predict the probability of developing primary hyperparathyroidism, only Gleason score, C-terminal fibroblast growth factor 23 and hormonal therapy had a significant effect (p < 0.05). Controlling for other covariates, a rise in fibroblast growth factor 23 increases the odds of developing primary hyperparathyroidism by 2% (p = 0.017), while patients with higher values of Gleason score have a much greater probability of developing primary hyperparathyroidism (log-odds = 3.6, p < 0.01).

Exploring the role of dietary biomarkers with metabolomics can potentially facilitate objective dietary characterization, mitigate errors related to self-reported diet, agnostically test metabolic pathways, and identify mechanistic mediators.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate associations of diet-related metabolites with the risk of breast cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.Design: We examined prediagnostic serum concentrations of diet-related metabolites in a nested case-control study in 621 postmenopausal invasive breast cancer cases and 621 matched controls in the multicenter PLCO cohort. We calculated partial Pearson correlations between 617 metabolites and 55 foods, food groups, and vitamin supplements on the basis of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and derived from a 137-item self-administered food-frequency questionnaire. Diet-related metabolites (P-correlation < 1.47 × 10-6) were evaluated in breast cancer analyses. ORs for the 90th compared with the 10th percentile were calculated by using conditional logistic regression, with body mass index, physical inactivity, other breast cancer risk factors, and caloric intake controlled for (false discovery rate <0.2).Results: Of 113 diet-related metabolites, 3 were associated with overall breast cancer risk (621 cases): caprate (10:0), a saturated fatty acid (OR: 1.77; 95% CI = 1.28, 2.43); γ-carboxyethyl hydrochroman (γ-CEHC), a vitamin E (γ-tocopherol) derivative (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.28); and 4-androsten-3β,17β-diol-monosulfate (1), an androgen (OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.16). Nineteen metabolites were significantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (ER+) breast cancer (418 cases): 12 alcohol-associated metabolites, including 7 androgens and α-hydroxyisovalerate (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.50, 3.32); 3 vitamin E (tocopherol) derivatives (e.g., γ-CEHC; OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.70); butter-associated caprate (10:0) (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.23, 2.67); and fried food-associated 2-hydroxyoctanoate (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.07). No metabolites were significantly associated with ER-negative breast cancer (144 cases).Conclusions: Prediagnostic serum concentrations of metabolites related to alcohol, vitamin E, and animal fats were moderately strongly associated with ER+ breast cancer risk.

By using integrative metabolomics in a mouse model and human biopsies of prostate cancer, we identify alterations in tumours affecting the production of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM) and polyamine synthesis. Mechanistically, this metabolic rewiring stems from mTORC1-dependent regulation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) stability. This novel molecular regulation is validated in mouse and human cancer specimens. AMD1 is upregulated in human prostate cancer with activated mTORC1. Conversely, samples from a clinical trial with the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus exhibit a predominant decrease in AMD1 immunoreactivity that is associated with a decrease in proliferation, in line with the requirement of dcSAM production for oncogenicity.

The aim of the current study was to describe the prevalence of pathogenic germline variants in cancer-predisposing genes in men with prostate cancer and at least 1 additional primary cancer.  Methods:   Using a multigene panel, the authors sequenced germline DNA from 102 men with prostate cancer and at least 1 additional primary cancer who also met ≥1 of the following criteria: 1) age ≤55 years at the time of diagnosis of the first malignancy; 2) rare tumor type or atypical presentation of a common tumor; and/or 3) ≥3 primary malignancies. Cancer family history and clinicopathologic data were independently reviewed by a clinical genetic counselor to determine whether the patient met established criteria for testing for a hereditary cancer syndrome.  Results:   Sequencing identified approximately 3500 variants. Nine protein-truncating deleterious mutations were found across 6 genes, including BRCA2, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Likely pathogenic missense variants were identified in checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) and homeobox protein Hox-B13 (HOXB13). In total, 11 of 102 patients (10.8%) were found to have pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in cancer-predisposing genes. The majority of these men (64%) did not meet current clinical criteria for germline testing.  Conclusions:   Men with prostate cancer and at least 1 additional primary cancer are enriched for harboring a germline deleterious mutation in a cancer-predisposing gene that may impact cancer prognosis and treatment, but the majority do not meet current criteria for clinical genetic testing.

MiR-34a expression is often downregulated in cancer cells and its restoration has been shown to exert a tumor-suppressive effect. However, effective and safe delivery of synthetic miRNA analogs into cancer cells remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to evaluate cell-penetrating peptide PepFect (PF)14 as a carrier for delivery of miR-34a-5p into human primary prostate carcinoma-1 (PPC-1) cells. Using microarray expression analysis, we identified a total of 3,283 (1,744 upregulated and 1,539 downregulated) differentially expressed genes in PF14:miR-34a-5p-transfected cells. In comparison, miR-34a-5p delivery with the commercially available lipid-based reagent siPORT-NeoFX (siPORT) had less robust effects on differential expression and affected fewer genes significantly (90 upregulated and 91 downregulated genes). Functional annotation revealed significant enrichment for downregulated genes in processes and pathways associated with the cell cycle and proliferation regulation in PF14:miR-34a-5p-transfected cells. Five genes (ARHGAP1, AXL, CDC25A, FOSL1, and PDGFRA) were identified and validated as relevant quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-based markers of miR-34a-5p transfection efficiency.

Little is known about their etiologies except that studies have suggested a substantial heritable component. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive, genome-wide evaluation of inherited risks and possible mechanisms of etiology in BPH.  Methods:   We performed a three-stage, genome-wide association study (GWAS) of men from three independent populations, the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, the CLUE II cohort, and a Finnish hospital-based population. DNA samples were genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip in REDUCE and CLUE II, and using the Sequenom iPLEX system for the confirmation stage in the Finnish population. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between each SNP and BPH/LUTS.  Results:   Fourteen SNPs reached P < 5.0 × 10-4 in the meta-analysis of the two GWASs (CLUE II and REDUCE). A total of 773 SNPs were chosen for the confirmation step in the Finish cohort. Only one SNP (rs17144046) located ∼489 kb downstream of GATA3 remained significant after correction for multiple testing (P < 6.5 × 10-5 ). This SNP marginally reached the GWAS significance level after performing a meta-analysis of the three stages (P-meta = 8.89 × 10-7 ). Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses showed that the risk allele (G) of rs17144046 was significantly associated with increased expression of GATA3 (P = 0.017). Reported studies indicated a close correlation between GATA3 and BPH pathogenesis and progression.  Conclusions:   Rs17144046 located near GATA3 was significantly associated with BPH/LUTS in three independent populations, but did not reach a stringent GWAS significance level. Genetic variants of GATA3 may play a role in the inherited susceptibility and etiology of BPH/LUTS.

Of these, 235 patients underwent RARP, with bilateral placement of dHACM graft around the NVBs. They were matched in a 1:3 proportion with a similar group of patients (n = 705) who did not receive the allograft (control group or group 2). Minimum follow-up was 12 months. Postoperative outcomes were analyzed between propensity-matched dHACM graft (group 1) and non-graft groups (group 2). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared across techniques using the log-rank test. There were no significant demographic differences between the two groups. Potency was defined as the ability to achieve and maintain satisfactory erections firm enough for sexual intercourse, with or without the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. The mean time to potency was significantly lower in group 1 (2.37 months) versus group 2 (3.94 months) (p < 0.0001). The potency recovery rates were superior for group 1 at all early time points measured except at 12 months. The time to potency was significantly shorter in the dHACM group with full NS, 2.19 ± 1.84 versus 2.78 ± 2.70 mo. in the non-dHACM with full NS (p = 0.029). In the dHACM group with partial NS, the mean time to potency was 3.05 ± 2.32 versus 3.92 ± 3.42 mo. in the non-dHACM with partial NS (p = 0.021). Patients who received the dHACM wrap around the NVB after RARP accelerates the return to potency when compared to a similar control group without the use of the allograft. We also demonstrated that this faster return to potency occurs regardless of the degree of the NS preservation. Younger patients (<55 years of age) had the highest overall advantage if they received the graft. Our results indicate that dHACM placement at the site of the prostatic NVB does not increase the risk of BCR after RARP, neither in the presence of PSM, extra-prostatic disease (≥pT3) nor high Gleason score (Gleason ≥8).""","""['Gabriel Ogaya-Pinies', 'Hariharan Palayapalam-Ganapathi', 'Travis Rogers', 'Eduardo Hernandez-Cardona', 'Bernardo Rocco', 'R F Coelho', 'Cathy Jenson', 'Vipul R Patel']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['Re: Can Dehydrated Human Amnion/Chorion Membrane Accelerate the Return to Potency after a Nerve-Sparing Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy?

Methods:   Our study included 165 PCS residing in Edmonton, Alberta, from the PROMOTE trial. The PROMOTE trial was a randomized controlled trial of a behaviour change intervention to increase PA and quality of life in PCS. In the PROMOTE trial, 423 PCS were randomly assigned to a standard physical activity recommendation, self-administered implementation intention, or telephone-assisted implementation intention group. PA and quality of life outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1, and 3 months. To explore the role of the built environment, this study examined walkability and count of sport complexes.  Results:   Linear regression analyses revealed that the self-administered intervention group had an increase in self-reported PA minutes/week (β = 133.4, 95% CI = -18.9 to 285.6); however, none of the built environment variables were found to be significantly associated with PA.

Due to limited data from prospective studies, we hypothesized an important variability in the SRT management of these patients. Our aim was to investigate current practice patterns of SRT for local macroscopic recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  Material and methods:   A total of 14 Swiss radiation oncology centers were asked to complete a survey on treatment specifications for macroscopic locally recurrent disease including information on pretherapeutic diagnostic procedures, dose prescription, radiation delivery techniques and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Treatment recommendations on ADT were analyzed using the objective consensus methodology.  Results:   The majority of centers recommended pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and choline positron emission tomography (PET). The median prescribed dose to the prostate bed was 66 Gy (range 65-72 Gy) with a boost to the macroscopic lesion used by 79% of the centers with a median total dose of 72 Gy (range 70-80 Gy). Intensity-modulated rotational techniques were used by all centers and daily cone beam computed tomography (CT) was recommended by 43%. The use of concomitant ADT for any macroscopic recurrence was recommended by 43% of the centers while the remaining centers recommended it only for high-risk disease, which was not consistently defined.  Conclusion:   We observed a high variability of treatment paradigms when SRT is indicated for macroscopic local recurrences after prostatectomy. These data reflect the need for more standardized approaches and ultimately further research in this field.""","""['Alan Dal Pra', 'Cedric Panje', 'Thomas Zilli', 'Winfried Arnold', 'Kathrin Brouwer', 'Helena Garcia', 'Markus Glatzer', 'Silvia Gomez', 'Fernanda Herrera', 'Khanfir Kaouthar', 'Alexandros Papachristofilou', 'Gianfranco Pesce', 'Christiane Reuter', 'Hansjörg Vees', 'Daniel Rudolf Zwahlen', 'Daniel Engeler', 'Paul Martin Putora']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Lack of consensus for treatment concepts for macroscopic recurrences after radical prostatectomy.', 'Macroscopic locoregional relapse from prostate cancer: which role for salvage radiotherapy?', 'Radical salvage prostatectomy : Treatment of local recurrence of prostate cancer after radiotherapy.', 'Outcomes of salvage radiotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Locally recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy: radical salvage prostatectomy.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Dose-Escalated Salvage Radiotherapy for Macroscopic Local Recurrence of Prostate Cancer in the Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography Era.', 'Clinical Outcome of Salvage Radiotherapy for Locoregional Clinical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'PET/CT-Based Salvage Radiotherapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: Impact on Treatment Management and Future Directions.', 'Radiotherapy for pelvic nodal recurrences after radical prostatectomy: patient selection in clinical practice.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-guided salvage radiotherapy in prostate cancer.']"""

Studies have shown that nucleolar stress is positively correlated with apoptosis in breast, prostate and lung cancer cells. However, the role and function of nucleolar stress in ovarian cancer has not been reported. In this study, we found that the nucleolar stress inducer BMH-21 inhibited viability of SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, BMH-21 induced the expression of nucleolar stress marker proteins (nucleolin, nucleophosmin and fibrillarin) and promoted the nuclear export of these proteins. BMH-21 also decreased MDM2 proto-oncogene expression and increased protein levels of the tumor suppressor p53 and p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 (p‑p53‑Ser15), which contributed to increased expression of the downstream apoptosis-related protein BCL2 associated X (BAX) and activation of caspase-3. Taken together, these data provide the first reported evidence that induction of p53-dependent nucleolar stress by BMH-21 induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer.

A key step in androgen action, which is amplified in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), is AR nuclear translocation. Small molecules capable of inhibiting AR nuclear localization could be developed as novel therapeutics for CRPC. We developed a high-throughput screen and identified two structurally-related pyrroloimidazoles that could block AR nuclear localization in CRPC cells. We show that these two small molecules, 3-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole (EPPI) and 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]imidazole (CPPI) can inhibit the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of AR and reduce the proliferation of AR-positive but not AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines. EPPI and CPPI did not inhibit nuclear localization of the glucocorticoid receptor or the estrogen receptor, suggesting they selectively target AR. In LNCaP tumor xenografts, CPPI inhibited the proliferation of relapsed LNCaP tumors.

Materials and methods:   Consecutive eligible patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy between July 19 and December 28, 2016 were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study. The primary outcome was patient reported urinary incontinence on the EPIC (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) scale 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively. The relationship between the EPIC score of urinary incontinence and bladder neck size was evaluated by multiple regression. Predicted EPIC scores for incontinence were displayed graphically after using restricted cubic splines to model bladder neck size.  Results:   A total of 107 patients were enrolled. The response rate was 98% and 87% at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. Bladder neck size was not significantly associated with incontinence scores at 6 and 12 weeks. Comparing the 90th percentile for bladder neck size (18 mm) with the 10th percentile (7 mm) revealed no significant difference in adjusted EPIC scores for incontinence at 6 weeks (β coefficient 0.88, 95% CI -10.92-12.68, p = 0.88) or at 12 weeks (β coefficient 5.80, 95% CI -7.36-18.97, p = 0.39).

Resistance to therapy remains incompletely understood. In this open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase II study we investigated the clinical benefit of increasing the dose of AA at the time of resistance to standard-dose therapy.  Patients and methods:   Eligible patients had progressive mCRPC and started AA 1000 mg daily and P 5 mg twice daily. Patients who achieved any prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline after 12 weeks of therapy continued AA with P until PSA or radiographic progression. At progression, AA was increased to 1000 mg twice daily with unchanged P dosing. Patients were monitored for response to therapy for a minimum of 12 weeks or until PSA or radiographic progression. The primary end point was PSA decline of at least 30% after 12 weeks of therapy at the increased dose of AA.  Results:   Forty-one patients were enrolled from March 2013 through March 2014. Thirteen men experienced disease progression during standard-dose therapy and were subsequently treated with AA 1000 mg twice per day. Therapy was well tolerated. No PSA declines ≥ 30% nor radiographic responses were observed after 12 weeks of dose-escalated therapy. Higher baseline dehydroepiandrosterone levels, lower circulating tumor cell burden, and higher pharmacokinetic levels of abiraterone and abiraterone metabolites were associated with response to standard-dose therapy.

However, the validity of multiple imputation has not yet been assessed using real data. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of using multiple imputation for ""unknown"" prostate cancer stage recorded in the New South Wales Cancer Registry (NSWCR) in real-world conditions.  Methods:   Data from the population-based cohort study NSW Prostate Cancer Care and Outcomes Study (PCOS) were linked to 2000-2002 NSWCR data. For cases with ""unknown"" NSWCR stage, PCOS-stage was extracted from clinical notes. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the missing at random assumption adjusted for variables from two imputation models: a basic model including NSWCR variables only and an enhanced model including the same NSWCR variables together with PCOS primary treatment. Cox regression was used to evaluate the performance of MI.  Results:   Of the 1864 prostate cancer cases 32.7% were recorded as having ""unknown"" NSWCR stage. The missing at random assumption was satisfied when the logistic regression included the variables included in the enhanced model, but not those in the basic model only. The Cox models using data with imputed stage from either imputation model provided generally similar estimated hazard ratios but with wider confidence intervals compared with those derived from analysis of the data with PCOS-stage. However, the complete-case analysis of the data provided a considerably higher estimated hazard ratio for the low socio-economic status group and rural areas in comparison with those obtained from all other datasets.

This study assesses changes in early NaF PET/CT response measures in metastatic prostate cancer for correlation to clinical outcomes. Patients and Methods Fifty-six patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with osseous metastases had NaF PET/CT scans performed at baseline and after three cycles of chemotherapy (n = 16) or androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (n = 40). A novel technology, Quantitative Total Bone Imaging, was used for analysis. Global imaging metrics, including maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and total functional burden (SUVtotal), were extracted from composite lesion-level statistics for each patient and tracked throughout treatment. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated as a composite end point of progressive events using conventional imaging and/or physician discretion of clinical benefit; NaF imaging was not used for clinical evaluation. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted between imaging metrics and PFS. Results Functional burden (SUVtotal) assessed midtreatment was the strongest univariable PFS predictor (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.44 to 2.71; P < .001). Classification of patients based on changes in functional burden showed stronger correlation to PFS than did the change in number of lesions. Various global imaging metrics outperformed baseline clinical markers in predicting outcome, including SUVtotal and SUVmean. No differences in imaging response or PFS correlates were found for different treatment cohorts. Conclusion Quantitative total bone imaging enables comprehensive disease quantification on NaF PET/CT imaging, showing strong correlation to clinical outcomes. Total functional burden assessed after three cycles of hormonal therapy or chemotherapy was predictive of PFS for men with mCRPC.

Previously, the authors reported that black men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) in equal-access hospitals had an increased risk of biochemical disease recurrence (BCR), but recurrences were equally aggressive as those occurring in white men. The authors examined the association between race and long-term outcomes after RP.  Methods:   Data regarding 1665 black men (37%) and 2791 white men (63%) undergoing RP were analyzed. Using Cox models, the authors tested the association between race and BCR, BCR with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time <9 months (aggressive disease recurrence), metastases, PC-specific death, and overall death.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 102 months, 1566 men (35%) developed BCR, 217 men (5%) experienced aggressive disease recurrence, 193 men (4%) developed metastases, and 1207 men (27%) had died, 107 of whom (2%) died of PC. White men were older and had a lower preoperative PSA level, a lower biopsy and pathological grade group, and more capsular penetration but less seminal vesicle invasion and positive surgical margins versus black men (all P<.05). Black men were found to have a more recent surgery year (P<.001). On univariable analysis, black race was associated with increased BCR (P = .003) and reduced overall death (P = .017). On multivariable analysis, black race was not found to be associated with BCR (hazard ratio [HR], 1.07; P = .26), aggressive recurrence (HR, 1.14; P = .42), metastasis (HR, 1.24; P = .21), PC-specific death (HR, 1.03; P = .91), or overall death (HR, 1.03; P = .67).  Conclusions:   Among men undergoing RP at equal-access centers, although black men were found to have an increased risk of BCR, they had similar risks of aggressive disease recurrence, metastasis, and PC-specific death compared with white men, and the risk of BCR was found to be similar after controlling for risk parameters.

WDFY2, which is found to be a cancer-specific fusion gene with CDKN2D in ovarian cancer, is a new gene with unknown function in carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the role of WDFY2 in prostate cancer development. We examined WDFY2 expression in human prostate tissue specimens and prostate cancer cell lines BPH-1, LNCaP, PC3, and DU-145. Overexpression of WDFY2 was performed to evaluate the role of WDFY2 in cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation of prostate cancer cells. We analyzed the clinical impact and prognosis of WDFY2 expression on the progress of prostate cancer through data from online datasets. Our results showed that WDFY2 had lower expression level in prostate tumors than in normal tissues. Overexpression of WDFY2 in prostate cancer cells DU145 and PC-3 led to the suppression of cancer cell migration and colony formation. Furthermore, we found that WDFY2 exerted its role by suppressing the activity of Akt pathway other than the epithelial-mesenchymal transition progression. In conclusion, we have uncovered WDFY2 as a tumor suppressor gene and a new potential biomarker for cancer progression. Our results showed that WDFY2 inhibited cancer cell colony formation and migration via suppressing Akt pathway, making it a potential new therapeutic target in prostate cancer.""","""['Jianqing Wang', 'Xu Chen', 'Shijun Tong', 'Huihui Zhou', 'Jianliang Sun', 'Yuancheng Gou', 'Fei Wu', 'Jimeng Hu', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Guanxiong Ding']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['CORRIGENDUM to ""Overexpression of WDFY2 inhibits prostate cancer cell growth and migration via inactivation of Akt pathway"".', 'CDKN2D-WDFY2 is a cancer-specific fusion gene recurrent in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.', 'Upregulation of long non-coding RNA PlncRNA-1 promotes proliferation and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'S100A16 promotes cell proliferation and metastasis via AKT and ERK cell signaling pathways in human prostate cancer.', 'TIPE2 Overexpression Suppresses the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion in Prostate Cancer Cells by Inhibiting PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.', 'P63 modulates the expression of the WDFY2 gene which is implicated in cancer regulation and limb development.', 'The Insulin Receptor: An Important Target for the Development of Novel Medicines and Pesticides.', 'Downregulation of PGM5 expression correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis in human prostate cancer.', 'ZBTB38 suppresses prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration via directly promoting DKK1 expression.', 'Fusion genes in gynecologic tumors: the occurrence, molecular mechanism and prospect for therapy.', 'HNF1B inhibits cell proliferation via repression of SMAD6 expression in prostate cancer.']"""

However, its expression has recently been reported to be highly elevated in a series of tumors, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, indicating that sirtuin 6 plays dual roles in tumorigenicity in a cell/tumor type-specific manner. To our knowledge, the biological roles of sirtuin 6 in esophageal cancer cells have still been underestimated. In the study, data from quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based assays and immunohistochemical assays revealed that sirtuin 6 was remarkably overexpressed in esophageal squamous tumor tissues. Moreover, its upregulation was closely related with clinical features, such as gender, pathology, tumor-node-metastasis, and cell differentiation. Subsequently, the biological tests showed that it promoted cell proliferation and induced the expression of Bcl2, a key anti-apoptotic factor, in esophageal carcinoma cells. Moreover, using the ratio of LC3II/I, a widely recognized autophagy biomarker, we showed that it apparently induced cell autophagy, which was further confirmed by the autophagy flux assays. In addition, results from western blotting assays and immunoprecipitation assays displayed that sirtuin 6 specifically interacted with ULK1 and positively regulated its activity by inhibiting its upstream factor mammalian target of rapamycin activity. In summary, our studies shed insights into the crucial functions of sirtuin 6 in esophageal carcinoma cells and provide evidence supporting sirtuin 6-based personalized therapies in esophageal carcinoma cell patients.""","""['Nan Huang', 'Zhiwei Liu', 'Jiabei Zhu', 'Zhongqi Cui', 'Yuguang Li', 'Yongchun Yu', 'Fenyong Sun', 'Qiuhui Pan', 'Qingyuan Yang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['MACC1 induces autophagy to regulate proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of squamous cell carcinoma.', 'CLDN1 induces autophagy to promote proliferation and metastasis of esophageal squamous carcinoma through AMPK/STAT1/ULK1 signaling.', 'SBI0206965, a novel inhibitor of Ulk1, suppresses non-small cell lung cancer cell growth by modulating both autophagy and apoptosis pathways.', 'Mechanisms and disease implications of sirtuin-mediated autophagic regulation.', 'Impact of Sirtuin Enzymes on the Altered Metabolic Phenotype of Malignantly Transformed Cells.', 'Inhibition of cell invasion and migration by targeting matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression via sirtuin 6 silencing in human breast cancer cells.', 'SIRT6 promotes mitochondrial fission and subsequent cellular invasion in ovarian cancer.', 'Role of sirtuins in esophageal cancer: Current status and future prospects.', 'Sirtuin Modulators in Cellular and Animal Models of Human Diseases.', 'The regulatory effect of acetylation of HMGN2 and H3K27 on pyocyanin-induced autophagy in macrophages by affecting Ulk1 transcription.']"""

Whether inflammation occurs in periprostatic white adipose tissue (WAT), and contributes to the negative impact of obesity on PC aggressiveness, is unknown.  Methods:   In a single-center, cross-sectional design, men with newly diagnosed PC undergoing radical prostatectomy were eligible for study participation. The primary objective was to examine the prevalence of periprostatic WAT inflammation defined by the presence of crown-like structures (CLS-P) as detected by CD68 immunohistochemistry. Secondary objectives were to explore the clinical and systemic correlates of periprostatic WAT inflammation. Tumor characteristics and host factors including BMI, adipocyte diameter, and circulating levels of lipids, adipokines, and other metabolic factors were measured. Wilcoxon rank-sum, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests, and generalized linear regression were used to examine the association between WAT inflammation and tumor and host characteristics.  Results:   Periprostatic fat was collected from 169 men (median age 62 years; median BMI 28.3). Periprostatic WAT inflammation was identified in 49.7% of patients and associated with higher BMI (P=0.02), larger adipocyte size (P=0.004) and Gleason grade groups IV/V tumors (P=0.02). The relationship between WAT inflammation and high Gleason grade remained significant after adjusting for BMI (P=0.04). WAT inflammation correlated with higher circulating levels of insulin, triglycerides, and leptin/adiponectin ratio, and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared to those without WAT inflammation (P's <0.05).

Methods:   Participants in the present study were 555 patients with cancer, 18 years and older recruited from six centers in Germany, Iceland, and Norway. All had received strong opioids for at least 72 h. Data was collected with the Barriers Questionnaire-II, the Brief Pain Inventory, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30.  Results:   The mean (SD) age of patients was 61.68 (12.35) years and 53% were men. Most common diagnoses were gastrointestinal, lung, prostate, and breast cancer. The mean (SD) time from diagnosis was 32.24 (44.55) and 4.97 (9.64) months from start of opioid therapy. Mean (SD) pain severity was 3.19 (1.93) on a 0 to 10 scale, and 46.5% reported worst pain of 7 or higher.

State-of-the-art methods for detection of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion genes include reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with a detection limit of 1 fmol at urinary condition. RT-PCR is time consuming, costly, and inapplicable for multiplexing. Ability to identify multiple fusion genes in a single sample has become important for diagnostic and clinical purposes. There is a need for a sensitive diagnostic test to detect multiple TMPRSS2-ERG fusion genes for an early diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer. Here, we propose to develop an assay for prostate cancer diagnosis using oligonucleotide-functionalized quantum dot and magnetic microparticle for optical detection of rearranged TMPRSS2-ERG fusion genes at a low concentration in urine.

Materials and methods:   A total of 100 men with clinically localized recurrent prostate cancer at least 2 years after external beam radiation therapy underwent whole gland high intensity focused ultrasound in an open label trial from 2009 to 2012. Treatments were performed at 16 sites, including 14 in the United States and 2 in Canada. The primary end point was the combination of a prostate specific antigen nadir of 0.5 ng/ml or less and negative biopsy at 12 months. Validated questionnaires were administered to monitor changes in urinary and sexual function.  Results:   Of the 100 treated men, in whom mean age was 70 years (range 53 to 83), 78 completed the 12-month biopsy, which was negative in 63 (81%). Mean prostate specific antigen was 4.9 ng/ml (range 0.4 to 14) and the median Gleason score was 7. The 1-year end point of a prostate specific antigen nadir of 0.5 ng/ml or less plus negative biopsy was achieved in 50 men. During post-trial followup mean prostate specific antigen at 2 years was 1.1 ng/ml (range 0.1 to 17) in 33 patients. Adverse events developed in 91 men through 12 months, which were CTCAE grade 1 in 67, grade 2 in 80 and grade 3 in 20. Treatment related grade 3 adverse events included rectal fistulas in 5 men, which required surgery in 3, osteitis pubis in 3 and hematuria requiring intervention in 3. Treatment related grade 3 adverse events developed early in the trial and appeared related to operator experience. There were no life threatening adverse events or treatment related deaths.

In the low-risk group, specific survivals are up to 95% after 10years. The aim of the study is to describe the practices in brachytherapy in France.  Materials and methods:   A survey made by AFU (French Urologic Association) and SFRO (French Society Of Oncological Radiotherapy) assessing the practices in brachytherapy in France was sent to all the urologists and radiotherapists even if they did not practice it.  Results:   In total, 1417 surveys were sent, 285 were received coming from 211 urologists (74%) and 74 radiotherapists (26%). Sixty (21%) practiced brachytherapy (31 urologists, 29 radiotherapists). Low dose rate with permanent implants was used in 83,3%. Brachytherapy was advised for low-risk group by 90% who responded the survey, 73% used it in intermediate risk and only 13% in high risk.  Conclusion:   Brachytherapy is hardly used in low risk prostate cancer. It probably needs a reconsideration of recommendations due to the good results in association with a good picking.

The malignant metabolic shift converts prostate cells from ""citrate-producing"" to ""citrate-oxidizing"" cells, thereby enhancing glucose metabolism, a phenotype that contrasts classical tumoral Warburg metabolism. An on-line biosensor chip system (BIONAS 2500) was used to monitor metabolic changes (glycolysis and respiration) in response to the putative anti-cancer nutraceutical 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], in different prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines (LNCaP, VCaP, DU145 and PC3). LNCaP cells exhibited profound metabolic responsiveness to the treatment and thus extensive analysis of metabolism-modulating effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 were performed, including mRNA expression analysis of key metabolic genes (e.g. GLUT1 and PDHK1), analysis of TCA cycle metabolites, glucose uptake/consumption measurements, ATP production, and mitochondrial biogenesis/activity. Altogether, data demonstrate a vivid disruption of glucose metabolism by 1,25(OH)2D3, illustrated by a decreased glucose uptake and an accumulation of citrate/isocitrate due to TCA cycle truncation. Depletion of glycolytic intermediates led to a consistent decrease in TXNIP expression in response to 1,25(OH)2D3, an effect that coincided with the activation of AMPK signaling and a reduction in c-MYC expression. Reduction in TXNIP levels in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 was rescued by an AMPK signaling inhibitor and mimicked by a MYC inhibitor highlighting the possible involvement of both pathways in mediating 1,25(OH)2D3's metabolic effects in PCa cells. Furthermore, pharmacological and genetic modulation of the androgen receptor showed similar and disparate effects on metabolic parameters compared to 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, highlighting the AR-independent nature of 1,25(OH)2D3's metabolism-modulating effects.""","""['Mohamed A Abu El Maaty', 'Hamed Alborzinia', 'Shehryar J Khan', 'Michael Büttner', 'Stefan Wölfl']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res""","""['Activation of pro-survival metabolic networks by 1,25(OH)2D3 does not hamper the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutics.', 'Induction of androgen receptor by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 9-cis retinoic acid in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta: a molecular target of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in androgen-responsive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'The role of vitamin D in prostate cancer.', 'Vitamin D, intermediary metabolism and prostate cancer tumor progression.', ""Immunomodulatory Role of Thioredoxin Interacting Protein in Cancer's Impediments: Current Understanding and Therapeutic Implications."", 'Recapitulating Tumor Microenvironment Using AXTEX-4DTM for Accelerating Cancer Research and Drug Screening.', 'Calcitriol Suppresses Warburg Effect and Cell Growth in Human Colorectal Cancer Cells.', 'Dysregulated paired related homeobox\xa01 impacts on hepatocellular carcinoma phenotypes.', 'Vitamin D regulation of energy metabolism in cancer.']"""

Physical activity (PA) can positively affect the negative effects of cancer and cancer treatment and thereby increase quality of life in CPS. Nevertheless, only a minority of CPS meet PA guidelines. We developed the OncoActive (OncoActief in Dutch) intervention: a computer-tailored PA program to stimulate PA in prostate and colorectal CPS, because to our knowledge there are only a few PA interventions for these specific cancer types in the Netherlands METHODS: The OncoActive intervention was developed through systematic adaptation of a proven effective, evidence-based, computer-tailored PA intervention for adults over fifty, called Active Plus. The Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol was used to guide the systematic adaptation. A literature study and interviews with prostate and colorectal CPS and health care professionals revealed that both general and cancer-specific PA determinants are important and should be addressed. Change objectives, theoretical methods and applications and the actual program content were adapted to address the specific needs, beliefs and cancer-related issues of prostate and colorectal CPS. Intervention participants received tailored PA advice three times, on internet and with printed materials, and a pedometer to set goals to improve PA. Pre- and pilot tests showed that the intervention was highly appreciated (target group) and regarded safe and feasible (healthcare professionals). The effectiveness of the intervention is being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (n = 428), consisting of an intervention group and a usual care waiting-list control group, with follow-up measurements at three, six and twelve months. Participants are recruited from seventeen hospitals and with posters, flyers and calls in several media.  Discussion:   Using the Intervention Mapping protocol resulted in a systematically adapted, theory and evidence-based intervention providing tailored PA advice to prostate and colorectal CPS. If the intervention turns out to be effective in increasing PA, as evaluated in a RCT, possibilities for nationwide implementation and extension to other cancer types will be explored.

In this study, we used the recalibrated model to assess the effects of familial risk, quality of life (QoL) preferences, age, and active surveillance.  Methods:   Men with average and elevated familial PCa risk were simulated in separate models, differing in familial risk parameters. Familial risk was assumed to affect PCa onset and progression simultaneously in the base-case, and separately in scenario analyses. Evaluated screening strategies included one-time screening at different ages, and screening at different intervals and age ranges. Optimal screening strategies were identified depending on age and individual QoL preferences. Strategies were additionally evaluated with active surveillance by biennial re-biopsy delaying treatment of localized cancer until grade progression to Gleason score ≥ 7.  Results:   Screening men with average PCa risk reduced quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) even under favorable assumptions. Men with elevated familial risk, depending on age and disutilities, gained QALE. While for men with familial risk aged 55 and 60 years annual screening to age 69 was the optimal strategy over most disutility ranges, no screening was the preferred option for 65 year-old men with average and above disutilities. Active surveillance greatly reduced overtreatment, but QALE gains by averted adverse events were opposed by losses due to delayed treatment and additional biopsies. The effect of active surveillance on the benefit-harm balance of screening differed between populations, as net losses and gains in QALE predicted for screening without active surveillance in men with average and familial PCa risk, respectively, were both reduced.  Conclusions:   Assumptions about PCa risk and screen-detectable prevalence significantly affect the benefit-harm balance of screening. Based on the assumptions of our model, PCa screening should focus on candidates with familial predisposition with consideration of individual QoL preferences and age. Active surveillance may require treatment initiation before Gleason score progression to 7. Alternative active surveillance strategies should be evaluated in further modeling studies.""","""['Nikolai Mühlberger', 'Kristijan Boskovic', 'Murray D Krahn', 'Karen E Bremner', 'Willi Oberaigner', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Wolfgang Horninger', 'Gaby Sroczynski', 'Uwe Siebert']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Public Health""","""['The ONCOTYROL Prostate Cancer Outcome and Policy Model: Effect of Prevalence Assumptions on the Benefit-Harm Balance of Screening.', 'Long-term Results of Active Surveillance in the Göteborg Randomized, Population-based Prostate Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk prostate cancer: a decision analysis.', 'Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a systematic review of decision-analytical models.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'American Indian/Alaska Native men are less likely to receive prostate-specific antigen testing and digital rectal exams from primary care providers than White men: a secondary analysis of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2012-2018.', 'Health Burdens and SES in Alabama: Using Geographic Information System to Examine Prostate Cancer Health Disparity.', 'Assessment of harms, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: A micro-simulation study of 230 scenarios.', 'Epidemiological Determinants of Advanced Prostate Cancer in Elderly Men in the United States.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis on incidence of prostate cancer in Iran.']"""

EMT is integral in early stages of development and wound healing. Studies have shown that EMT could be a critical early event in tumor metastasis that is involved in acquisition of migratory and invasive properties in multiple carcinomas.  Methods:   In this study, we used 15 published gene expression microarray datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) that represent 12 cell lines from 6 cancer types across 95 observations (45 unique samples and 50 replicates) with different modes of induction of EMT or the reverse transition, mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). We integrated multiple gene expression datasets while considering study differences, batch effects, and noise in gene expression measurements. A universal differential EMT gene list was obtained by normalizing and correcting the data using four approaches, computing differential expression from each, and identifying a consensus ranking. We confirmed our discovery of novel EMT genes at mRNA and protein levels in an in vitro EMT model of prostate cancer - PC3 epi, EMT and Taxol resistant cell lines. We validate our discovery of C1orf116 as a novel EMT regulator by siRNA knockdown of C1orf116 in PC3 epithelial cells.  Results:   Among differentially expressed genes, we found known epithelial and mesenchymal marker genes such as CDH1 and ZEB1. Additionally, we discovered genes known in a subset of carcinomas that were unknown in prostate cancer. This included epithelial specific LSR and S100A14 and mesenchymal specific DPYSL3. Furthermore, we also discovered novel EMT genes including a poorly-characterized gene C1orf116. We show that decreased expression of C1orf116 is associated with poor prognosis in lung and prostate cancer patients. We demonstrate that knockdown of C1orf116 expression induced expression of mesenchymal genes in epithelial prostate cancer cell line PC3-epi cells, suggesting it as a candidate driver of the epithelial phenotype.  Conclusions:   This comprehensive approach of statistical analysis and functional validation identified global expression patterns in EMT and candidate regulatory genes, thereby both extending current knowledge and identifying novel drivers of EMT.""","""['Princy Parsana', 'Sarah R Amend', 'James Hernandez', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Alexis Battle']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Molecular Pathways Mediating Metastases to the Brain via Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition: Genes, Proteins, and Functional Analysis.', 'Comparative gene co-expression network analysis of epithelial to mesenchymal transition reveals lung cancer progression stages.', 'High-throughput mRNA and miRNA profiling of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in MDCK cells.', 'Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition and Circulating Tumor Cells in Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Extended Exposure Topotecan Significantly Improves Long-Term Drug Sensitivity by Decreasing Malignant Cell Heterogeneity and by Preventing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Reliable epithelial-mesenchymal transition biomarkers for colorectal cancer detection.', 'Inflammatory Breast Cancer: The Secretome of HCMV+ Tumor-Associated Macrophages Enhances Proliferation, Invasion, Colony Formation, and Expression of Cancer Stem Cell Markers.', 'The Specifically Androgen-Regulated Gene (SARG) Promotes Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC) Lymphatic Metastasis Through Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C (VEGF-C) and VEGF Receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) Axis.', 'Genetic Clonality as the Hallmark Driving Evolution of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

Then, associations of transcription factor 12 expression with various clinicopathological characteristics and patients' prognosis of prostate cancer were evaluated. Its involvements in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth were determined by in vitro and in vivo experiments. As a result, the positive immunostaining of transcription factor 12 protein was localized in cytoplasm and/or nucleus of prostate cancer cells. Its expression levels were decreased with prostate cancer Gleason score increased. Statistically, the decreased expression of transcription factor 12 protein more frequently occurred in prostate cancer patients with high Gleason score, positive metastasis, prostate-specific antigen failure, and short biochemical recurrence-free survival (all p < 0.05). Importantly, multivariate analysis showed that the status of transcription factor 12 expression was an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer. Functionally, enforced expression of transcription factor 12 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo.
