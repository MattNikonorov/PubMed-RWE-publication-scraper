Src is known to regulate several biological functions of tumor cells, including proliferation. There are several Src inhibitors under evaluation for clinical effectiveness but have shown little activity in monotherapy trials of solid tumors. Combination studies are being explored by in vitro analysis and in clinical trials. Here we investigate the effect of simultaneous inhibition of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and Src on androgen receptor (AR) signaling in prostate cancer cells. AhR has also been reported to interact with the Src signaling pathway during prostate development. c-Src protein kinase is associated with the AhR complex in the cytosol and upon ligand binding to AhR, c-Src is activated and released from the complex. AhR has also been shown to regulate AR signaling which remains functionally important in the development and progression of prostate cancer. We provide evidence that co-inhibition of AhR and Src abolish AR activity. Evaluation of total protein and cellular fractions revealed decreased pAR expression and AR nuclear localization. Assays utilizing an androgen responsive element (ARE) and qRT-PCR analysis of AR genes revealed decreased AR promoter activity and transcriptional activity in the presence of both AhR and Src inhibitors. Furthermore, co-inhibition of AhR and Src reduced the growth of prostate cancer cells compared to individual treatments. Several studies have revealed that AhR and Src individually inhibit cellular proliferation. However, this study is the first to suggest simultaneous inhibition of AhR and Src to inhibit AR signaling and prostate cancer cell growth.""","""['Maryam Ghotbaddini', 'Keyana Cisse', 'Alexis Carey', 'Joann B Powell']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Four and a half LIM domain 2 alters the impact of aryl hydrocarbon receptor on androgen receptor transcriptional activity.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'The aryl hydrocarbon receptor is constitutively active in advanced prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulatory processes affecting androgen receptor expression, stability, and function: potential targets to treat hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'A dynamic role for the Ah receptor in cell signaling?

Although an interplay between the genetic, epigenetic and metabolic rewiring in cancer is beginning to emerge, it remains unclear how this metabolic plasticity occurs. Here, we report that in prostate cancer cells (PCCs) microRNAs (miRNAs) greatly contribute to deregulation of mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) oxidation via carnitine system modulation. We provide evidence that the downregulation of hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-129-5p and hsa-miR-378 induced an increase in both expression and activity of CPT1A, CACT and CrAT in malignant prostate cells. Moreover, the analysis of human prostate cancer and prostate control specimens confirmed the aberrant expression of miR-124-3p, miR-129-5p and miR-378 in primary tumors. Forced expression of the miRNAs mentioned above affected tumorigenic properties, such as proliferation, migration and invasion, in PC3 and LNCaP cells regardless of their hormone sensitivity. CPT1A, CACT and CrAT overexpression allow PCCs to be more prone on FA utilization than normal prostate cells, also in the presence of high pyruvate concentration. Finally, the simultaneous increase of CPT1A, CACT and CrAT is fundamental for PCCs to sustain FA oxidation in the presence of heavy lipid load on prostate cancer mitochondria. Indeed, the downregulation of only one of these proteins reduces PCCs metabolic flexibility with the accumulation of FA-intermediate metabolites in the mitochondria. Together, our data implicate carnitine cycle as a primary regulator of adaptive metabolic reprogramming in PCCs and suggest new potential druggable pathways for prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['A Valentino', 'A Calarco', 'A Di Salle', 'M Finicelli', 'S Crispi', 'R A Calogero', 'F Riccardo', 'A Sciarra', 'A Gentilucci', 'U Galderisi', 'S Margarucci', 'G Peluso']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['MicroRNA-27a-5p regulation by promoter methylation and MYC signaling in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'The carnitine system and cancer metabolic plasticity.', 'Activin A regulates microRNAs and gene expression in LNCaP cells.', 'Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A functions to repress FoxO transcription factors to allow cell cycle progression in ovarian cancer.', 'Fatty acid oxidation and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I: emerging therapeutic targets in cancer.', 'Mitochondrial CPT1A: Insights into structure, function, and basis for drug development.', ""Role of Lipids and Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression and the Tumor's Immune Environment."", 'Targeting Energy Metabolism in Cancer Treatment.', 'Comparative transcriptomes of three different skin sites for the Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans).', 'circRNA-0002109 promotes glioma malignant progression via modulating the miR-129-5P/EMP2 axis.']"""

Methods:   Phantom experiments were performed at five systems to estimate the bias, short-term repeatability, and reproducibility across all systems expressed with the within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV). Monthly measurements were performed on two systems for long-term repeatability estimation. To evaluate clinical repeatability, two T2 maps (voxel size 0.8 × 0.8 × 3 mm3 ; 5 min) were acquired at separate visits on one system for 13 prostate cancer patients. Repeatability was assessed per patient in relation to spatial resolution. T2 values were compared for tumor, peripheral zone, and transition zone.  Results:   Phantom measurements showed a small bias (median = -0.9 ms) and good short-term repeatability (median wCV = 0.5%). Long-term repeatability was 0.9 and 1.1% and reproducibility between systems was 1.7%. The median bias observed in patients was -1.1 ms. At voxel level, the median wCV was 15%, dropping to 4% for structures of 0.5 cm3 . The median tumor T2 values (79 ms) were significantly lower (P < 0.001) than in the peripheral zone (149 ms), but overlapped with the transition zone (91 ms).  Conclusions:   Reproducible T2 mapping of the prostate is feasible with good spatial resolution in a clinically reasonable scan time, allowing reliable measurement of T2 in structures as small as 0.5 cm3 .

Here, we investigated the mechanism(s) underlying the anticancer potential of GTIN. In this study, investigations were showed that GTIN preferentially induces programed cell death of prostate cancer (PCa) cells in vitro and in vivo. MTT data showed that GTIN exhibited the anti-proliferation effect on human PCa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Among two kinds of PCa cells, androgen-dependent LNCaP cells were the most susceptible to GTIN. GTIN was evaluated for apoptotic and autophagic activities in LNCaP cells, but not in androgen-independent DU145 cells with mutant Atg5 and resistant to autophagy. Molecular data showed the apoptotic effect of GTIN at a high dose in PCa cells might be mediated via mitochondrial pathway. The lower dose of GTIN-induced autophagy enhances LNCaP cell death, and is dependent on class III PI3K and Atg5 pathway. Finally, GTIN was evidenced by its inhibition on the growth of LNCaP cells in xenograft tumor studies. As a result, our data presented the first evidence of GTIN as an inducer of apoptotic and autophagic cell death in LNCaP cells, and provide a new mechanism for its anticancer activity.""","""['Ming-Shih Lee', 'Chia-Wen Tsai', 'Chi-Ping Wang', 'Jing-Hsien Chen', 'Hui-Hsuan Lin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['KML001 Induces Apoptosis and Autophagic Cell Death in Prostate Cancer Cells via Oxidative Stress Pathway.', 'Atg5 regulates phenethyl isothiocyanate-induced autophagic and apoptotic cell death in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Monascuspiloin induces apoptosis and autophagic cell death in human prostate cancer cells via the Akt and AMPK signaling pathways.', 'A review on the chemotherapeutic potential of fisetin: In vitro evidences.', 'Autophagy as a Molecular Target of Flavonoids Underlying their Protective Effects in Human Disease.', 'MT-12 inhibits the proliferation of bladder cells in vitro and in vivo by enhancing autophagy through mitochondrial dysfunction.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Anti-Atherosclerotic Effect of Gossypetin on Abnormal Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation and Migration.', ""Non-'classical' MEKs: A review of MEK3-7 inhibitors."", 'Lotus Seedpod Extracts Reduced Lipid Accumulation and Lipotoxicity in Hepatocytes.']"""

Our objective is to assess the degree and impact of risk reclassification with the increasing number of SNPs.  Methods:   A total of 3239 patients from the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial were included. Four genetic risk scores (GRSs) were calculated based on sets of sequentially discovered prostate cancer (PCa) risk-associated SNPs (17, 34, 51, and 68 SNPs).  Results:   Pair-wise correlation coefficients between sets of GRSs increased as more SNPs were included in the GRS: 0.80, 0.86, and 0.95 for 17 versus 34 SNPs, 34 versus 51 SNPs, and 51 versus 68 SNPs, respectively. Using a GRS of 1.5 as a cutoff for higher versus lower risk, reclassification rates of PCa risk decreased: 14.11%, 12.04%, and 8.15% for 17 versus 34 SNPs, 34 versus 51 SNPs, and 51 versus 68 SNPs, respectively. Evolving GRSs, nevertheless, provide a tool for further refining risk assessment. When all four sequential GRSs were considered, the detection rates of PCa for men whose GRSs were consistently <1.5, reclassified, and consistently ≥1.5 were 20.8%, 29.67%, and 39.26%, respectively (Ptrend = 1.12 × 10-8 ). In comparison, the detection rates of PCa in men with negative or positive family history were 23.75% and 31.78%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Risk assessment using currently available SNPs is justified. Multiple GRS values from evolving sets of SNPs provide a valuable tool for better refining risk.""","""['Haitao Chen', 'Rong Na', 'Vignesh T Packiam', 'Carly A Conran', 'Deke Jiang', 'Sha Tao', 'Hongjie Yu', 'Xiaoling Lin', 'Wei Meng', 'S Lilly Zheng', 'Charles B Brendler', 'Brian T Helfand', 'Jianfeng Xu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism-Based Genetic Risk Score and Patient Age at Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Population-standardized genetic risk score: the SNP-based method of choice for inherited risk assessment of prostate cancer.', 'Dutasteride for the prevention of prostate cancer in men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia: results of a phase III randomized open-label 3-year trial.', 'Clinical validity and utility of genetic risk scores in prostate cancer.', '5-α-Reductase inhibitors for prostate cancer chemoprevention: an updated Cochrane systematic review.', 'Inherited risk assessment and its clinical utility for predicting prostate cancer from diagnostic prostate biopsies.', 'Association of prostate cancer polygenic risk score with number and laterality of tumor cores in active surveillance patients.', 'Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism-Based Genetic Risk Score and Patient Age at Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Association Between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in the Vitamin D Receptor and Incidence of Dry Eye Disease in Chinese Han Population.', 'Current progress and questions in germline genetics of prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   Of 3262 patients treated with LDR brachytherapy at our centre up to June 2016, we retrospectively identified 597 patients aged ≤60 years at treatment with ≥3-years post-implantation follow-up and four prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements, of which one was at baseline. Overall survival (OS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) and relapse free survival (RFS) were analysed together with prospectively collected physician-reported adverse events and patient-reported symptom scores.  Results:   The median (range) age was 57 (44-60) years, follow-up was 8.9 (1.5-17.2) years, and PSA follow-up 5.9 (0.8-15) years. Low-, intermediate- and high-risk disease represented 53%, 37% and 10% of the patients, respectively. At 10 years after implantation OS and PCSS were 98% and 99% for low-risk, 99% and 100% for intermediate-risk, and 93% and 95% for high-risk disease, respectively. At 10 years after implantation RFS, using the PSA level nadir plus 2 ng/mL definition, was 95%, 90% and 87% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease, respectively. Urinary stricture was the most common genitourinary adverse event occurring in 19 patients (3.2%).

Moreover, knockdown of Cyclin K causes mitotic catastrophe displayed by multinucleation and spindle multipolarity. Furthermore, we demonstrate a Cyclin K dependent regulation of the mitotic kinase Aurora B and provide evidence for an Aurora B dependent induction of mitotic catastrophe. In addition, we show that Cyclin K expression is associated with poor biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients with prostate cancer treated with an adjuvant therapy.

Reduced exposure of surface epithelia to oxidative stress may prevent the onset or reduce the growth of ovarian cancer. Lycopene is well-known for its excellent antioxidant properties. In this study, the potential of lycopene in the prevention and treatment of ovarian cancer was investigated using an intraperitoneal animal model. Lycopene prevention significantly reduced the metastatic load of ovarian cancer-bearing mice, whereas treatment of already established ovarian tumors with lycopene significantly diminished the tumor burden. Lycopene treatment synergistically enhanced anti-tumorigenic effects of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Immunostaining of tumor and metastatic tissues for Ki67 revealed that lycopene reduced the number of proliferating cancer cells. Lycopene decreased the expression of the ovarian cancer biomarker, CA125. The anti-metastatic and anti-proliferative effects were accompanied by down-regulated expression of ITGA5, ITGB1, MMP9, FAK, ILK and EMT markers, decreased protein expression of integrin α5 and reduced activation of MAPK. These findings indicate that lycopene interferes with mechanisms involved in the development and progression of ovarian cancer and that its preventive and therapeutic use, combined with chemotherapeutics, reduces the tumor and metastatic burden of ovarian cancer in vivo.""","""['Nina Pauline Holzapfel', 'Ali Shokoohmand', 'Ferdinand Wagner', 'Marietta Landgraf', 'Simon Champ', 'Boris Michael Holzapfel', 'Judith Ann Clements', 'Dietmar Werner Hutmacher', 'Daniela Loessner']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Am J Cancer Res""","""['Twist induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell motility in breast cancer via ITGB1-FAK/ILK signaling axis and its associated downstream network.', 'Lycopene Protects Against Spontaneous Ovarian Cancer Formation in Laying Hens.', 'miR-17 inhibits ovarian cancer cell peritoneal metastasis by targeting ITGA5 and ITGB1.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in ovarian cancer progression: a crucial role for the endothelin axis.', 'Management of epithelial ovarian cancer.

However, findings from previous studies are not entirely consistent, and only one has investigated the possible relation between T. vaginalis seropositivity and PCa in African-American men who are at highest risk of both infection and PCa. Therefore, we examined this possible relation in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, including separate analyses for aggressive PCa and African-American men.  Methods:   We included a sample of participants from a previous nested case-control study of PCa, as well as all additional Caucasian, aggressive, and African-American cases diagnosed since the previous study (total n = 438 Gleason 7 Caucasian cases, 487 more advanced Caucasian cases (≥Gleason 8 or stage III/IV), 201 African-American cases, and 1216 controls).

Recently, loss of bone quality has received attention as a factor that causes loss of bone strength independent of bone mineral density (BMD). Pentosidine has been identified as a surrogate marker of bone quality. Therefore, bone quality markers were evaluated retrospectively in PCa patients receiving ADT with or without denosumab.  Patients and methods:   This study included 46 PCa patients. Twenty patients received denosumab. We measured pentosidine as bone quality marker and TRACP-5b as bone turnover marker.

Here, in combination with enzalutamide-mediated AR blockade, we investigated the effect of PCA3 targeting on the viability of PCa cells.  Materials and methods:   In hormone-sensitive LNCaP cells, AR-overexpressing LNCaP-AR+ cells and VCaP cells (representing CRPC), PCA3 was silenced using siRNA oligonucleotides. Gene expression and cell viability was assessed in PCA3-silenced and/or AR-blocked cells.  Results:   PCA3 targeting reduced the expression of AR-related genes (i.e. prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate-specific transcript 1 (non-protein coding) (PCGEM1)) and potentiated the effect of enzalutamide. Proliferation of PCa cells was suppressed upon PCA3 silencing with a greater effect in LNCaP-AR+ cells. Furthermore, PCA3 silencing sensitized PCa cells to enzalutamide-induced loss of cell growth.

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at -251 upstream of the transcriptional start site of the IL-8 gene has been shown to influence its production. The effects of IL-8 are mediated by two highly related chemokine receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. The present study investigated the influence of the IL-8 and CXCR2 gene variation on susceptibility and clinicopathological characteristics of PC in a group of Brazilian subjects.  Methods:   Two hundred and one patients and 185 healthy controls were enrolled in a case-control study. Blood was collected for DNA extraction; typing of IL-8 -251 T/A and CXCR2 +1208 C/T genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP), followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Risk association between the genotypes, PC susceptibility and tumor characteristics was estimated by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age at diagnosis.  Results:   A significant association was found between the heterozygous CXCR2 +1208 CT genotype and stage of PC. The CXCR2 +1208 CT genotype was significantly less frequent in patients with clinical stage T3-T4 compared to T1-T2 (56.7 versus 80.5%). Our findings suggest that carriers of the CXCR2 +1208 CT genotype had a protective effect for advanced PC (CT versus CC: adjusted OR=0.25; P=0.02). No association was observed between the SNP for IL-8 -251 T/A and clinicopathological parameters of PC.

Materials and methods:   176 lesions in 79 consecutive patients are analyzed, lesions are histopathologically verified by MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy. All lesions are rated according to the PI-RADSv2 lexicon, descriptors for T2w and DWI sequences and resulting assessment categories are assigned by two independent blinded radiologists. We perform receiver-operating-characteristic analysis using the assessment categories. To analyze inter-observer agreement, we calculate weighted kappa values for assessment category assignment and unweighted kappa values for descriptor assignment.  Results:   PI-RADSv2 assessment categories yield an area under the curve of 0.76/0.74 (radiologist 1/radiologist 2), P >0.05. Weighted kappa for agreement is 0.601 in the peripheral zone and 0.580 in the transition zone. We detect a difference in the cancer rate for PI-RADSv2 category 3 between peripheral zone (32%) and transition zone (12%), P <0.05. We obtain moderate agreement at most for descriptor assignment with kappa values ranging from 0.082 (T2w shape in the transition zone) to 0.407 (T2w signal intensity in the peripheral zone) and 0.493 (ADC pattern in the peripheral zone). Our analysis corroborates typical descriptors for benign/malignant lesions, but also reveals insights into potential pitfalls - T2w wedge shaped lesions in the peripheral zone have a considerable cancer rate, despite being labelled category 2 in the lexicon.  Conclusion:   Agreement for descriptor assignment in the PI-RADSv2 lexicon is at most moderate in our study. Typical descriptors for benign and malignant lesions are validated, whereas the discriminatory power of some descriptors is challenged. The difference in the cancer rate for PI-RADSv2 category 3 between peripheral zone and transition zone should be considered when management recommendations are linked to assessment categories in the future.""","""['Matthias Benndorf', 'Felix Hahn', 'Malte Krönig', 'Cordula Annette Jilg', 'Tobias Krauss', 'Mathias Langer', 'Philippe Dovi-Akué']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Peripheral zone lesions of intermediary risk in multiparametric prostate MRI: Frequency and validation of the PI-RADSv2 risk stratification algorithm based on focal contrast enhancement.', 'Intra- and interreader reproducibility of PI-RADSv2: A multireader study.', 'Can Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Values Assist PI-RADS Version 2 DWI Scoring?

The primary end point was clinical benefit defined as nonprogression at 12 weeks with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) or other toxicities requiring termination of treatment. Secondary end points included response rate, pain response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were captured and tested for LHRH receptors, as well as for internalization of AEZS-108 using autofluorescence.  Results:   Twenty-five patients were enrolled; 20 patients had at least 1 measurable lesion at baseline. Patients received a median of 5 cycles (range, 1-9) and 44% of patients received at least 6 cycles with 2 patients who completed ≥ 8 cycles. Considering clinical benefits, 13 patients (52%) remained progression-free at 12 weeks with no DLT or other toxicities requiring termination of treatment. For clinical response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 criteria, 1 patient (4%) experienced a confirmed partial response (PR) within 12 weeks, 14 patients (56%) had stable disease (SD), and 8 patients (32%) had disease progression. For maximal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, 1 patient (4%) experienced a confirmed PR within 12 weeks, 21 patients (84%) had SD, and 3 patients (12%) had disease progression as denoted by their best PSA response. Pain improved in 13 (59%) patients. The median PFS was 3.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-4.4), and median OS was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2-10.1) with a median follow-up of 16.1 months (range, 3.2-36.1). Baseline CTC enumeration was an independent predictor of OS but not PFS.  Conclusion:   AEZS-108 showed activity in patients who were pretreated, a subset typically very difficult to treat, and maintained an acceptable safety profile.""","""['Steven S Yu', 'Kanthi Athreya', 'Stephen V Liu', 'Andrew V Schally', 'Denice Tsao-Wei', 'Susan Groshen', 'David I Quinn', 'Tanya B Dorff', 'Shigang Xiong', 'Jurgen Engel', 'Jacek Pinski']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Phase I, dose-escalation study of the targeted cytotoxic LHRH analog AEZS-108 in patients with castration- and taxane-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy and safety of AEZS-108 (INN: zoptarelin doxorubicin acetate) an LHRH agonist linked to doxorubicin in women with platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer expressing LHRH receptors: a multicenter phase II trial of the ago-study group (AGO GYN 5).', 'AEZS-108 : a targeted cytotoxic analog of LHRH for the treatment of cancers positive for LHRH receptors.', 'Efficacy and safety of AEZS-108 (LHRH agonist linked to doxorubicin) in women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer expressing LHRH receptors: a multicenter phase 2 trial (AGO-GYN5).', 'Targeting of Peptide Cytotoxins to LHRH Receptors For Treatment of Cancer.', 'Conventional and new proposals of GnRH therapy for ovarian, breast, and prostatic cancers.', 'A stochastically curtailed single-arm phase II trial design for binary outcomes.', 'Antitumor Activity and Mechanism of Action of Hormonotoxin, an LHRH Analog Conjugated to Dermaseptin-B2, a Multifunctional Antimicrobial Peptide.', 'Targeted paclitaxel-octreotide conjugates inhibited the growth of paclitaxel-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells in vitro.', 'Dissecting the Hormonal Signaling Landscape in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a randomized walking group intervention to improve quality of life, circulating biomarkers, and morbidity among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.  Methods:   Men were recruited at Örebro University Hospital, Sweden, and randomized to an 11-week walking group intervention (n = 21) or usual care (n = 20). The intervention included weekly 1-hour walking group sessions and maintenance of 10,000 steps/day. Outcomes were changes in body composition, clinical factors, biomarkers of cardiovascular health, and quality of life between baseline and end of study. Analysis of covariance was used to compare outcomes in each group adjusted for baseline values.  Results:   All 41 men randomized completed the 11-week trial. Men assigned to the intervention walked on average 10,644 steps/day, and 92% reported missing 2 or fewer sessions. Both groups experienced similar weight loss at 11 weeks. Men in the intervention had a significant adjusted mean change in high-density lipoprotein of 0.14 mmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.27; P = .04), and suggestive adjusted mean changes in low-density lipoprotein of -0.22 mmol/L (95% CI, -0.47 to 0.03; P = .08) and in systolic blood pressure of -8.5 mm Hg (95% CI, -21.2 to 4.2; P = .18), compared with the usual care group.  Conclusions:   A walking group intervention among men with recent diagnosis of prostate cancer is feasible and potentially effective in improving cardiovascular health.

Currently, the effect of TRAF2 on growth of androgen-refractory prostate cancer in response to TRAIL and the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we aim to investigate the effect of TRAF2 on in vitro growth of human androgen-insensitive prostate cancer DU-145 cells in the presence of TRAIL. Bioinformatics analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data was performed to examine TRAF2 expression and the prognostic value in prostate cancer. Microarray data of GSE21032 dataset were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to explore TRAF2 expression in metastatic prostate cancer. Bioinformatics analysis was further conducted to investigate the association of TRAF2 expression with recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients. Colony formation, cell viability, and Annexin V/PI apoptosis assays were performed to investigate the effect of TRAF2 on in vitro growth and apoptosis in TRAIL-treated DU-145 cells. The expression levels of mRNA and protein were detected by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting assays. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that TRAF2 expression is significantly upregulated in prostate cancer patients with high Gleason scores (GS>7) compared with those with low Gleason scores (GS≤7). Upregulation of TRAF2 expression is significantly associated with recurrence-free survival in patients. In addition, TRAF2 knockdown can enhance apoptosis and downregulate SIRT1 expression in TRAIL-treated DU-145 cells. In vitro experiments further showed that SIRT1 knockdown can inhibit growth, and promote apoptosis in TRAIL-treated DU-145 cells. Overall, TRAF2 can influence in vitro growth of TRAIL-treated DU-145 cells at least partially via regulating SIRT1 expression, and may be a potentially valuable biomarker predicting recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients.""","""['Bingbing Wei', 'Jun Ruan', 'Yuanyuan Mi', 'Jimeng Hu', 'Jian Zhang', 'Zhirong Wang', 'Qiang Hu', 'Haowen Jiang', 'Qiang Ding']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['TRAF2 is a Valuable Prognostic Biomarker in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'CPNE1 Is a Useful Prognostic Marker and Is Associated with TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2 (TRAF2) Expression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Low-dose 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate enhances tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Pretreatment of docetaxel enhances TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', ""NutriTRAILomics in prostate cancer: time to have two strings to one's bow."", 'The roles of E3 ubiquitin ligases in cancer progression and targeted therapy.', 'Suppression of CDCA3 inhibits prostate cancer progression via NF‑κB/cyclin D1 signaling inactivation and p21 accumulation.', 'Roles of TRAFs in Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.', 'Transcriptome-wide miRNA identification of Bacopa monnieri: a cross-kingdom approach.', 'Identification of a key candidate gene‑phenotype network mediated by glycyrrhizic acid using pharmacogenomic analysis.']"""

An Exploratory Analysis of Medical Records""","""The FMR1 gene has been studied extensively with regard to expansions and premutations, but much less research has focused on potential effects of low CGG repeat length. Previous studies have demonstrated that BRCA1/2 positive women are more likely to have an FMR1 genotype with one low CGG allele, and that women with both FMR1 alleles in the low CGG repeat range are more likely to have had breast cancer compared to women with normal numbers of CGG repeats. However, there has been no research as to whether low CGG repeat length impacts cancer risks in men. Therefore, this study aimed to examine cancer incidence and related risk factors in men with low CGG repeat length in the FMR1 gene. We utilized subject data from the Marshfield Personalized Medicine Research Project to compare cancer-related diagnoses between 878 males with low CGG repeat length (< 24 repeats) and 368 male controls with CGG repeats in the normal range (24 to 40 repeats). We utilized ICD-9 codes to examine various cancer diagnoses, family histories of cancer, other non-malignant neoplasms, cancer surveillance, and genetic susceptibility. Men with low CGG repeats were identified to have significantly higher rates of family history of any cancer type (p = 0.011), family history of any BRCA-associated cancer (p = 0.002), and specifically, family history of prostate cancer (p = 0.007). The mean number of BRCA-associated cancer diagnoses (breast, prostate, pancreatic, and melanoma) per individual in the low CGG group was slightly higher than that of the control group, with this difference trending toward significance (p = 0.091). Additionally, men with low CGG repeats had significantly higher rates of connective/soft tissue neoplasms (p = 0.026). Additional research is needed to replicate the observations reported in this preliminary exploratory study, particularly including verification of ICD-9 codes and family history by a genetic counselor.""","""['Hallee C Adamsheck', 'Elizabeth M Petty', 'Jinkuk Hong', 'Mei W Baker', 'Murray H Brilliant', 'Marsha R Mailick']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Genet Couns""","""['Diminished ovarian reserve is not observed in infertility patients with high normal CGG repeats on the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene.', 'The significance of fragile X mental retardation gene 1 CGG repeat sizes in the normal and intermediate range in women with primary ovarian insufficiency.', 'FMR1 CGG allele length in Israeli BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers and the general population display distinct distribution patterns.', 'Absence of BRCA/FMR1 correlations in women with ovarian cancers.', 'Pathological Effects of the FMR1 CGG-Repeat Polymorphism (5-55 Repeat Numbers): Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Unveiling the m6A Methylation Regulator Links between Prostate Cancer and Periodontitis by Transcriptomic Analysis.', 'Low normal FMR1 genotype in older adult women: Psychological well-being and motor function.', 'The Phenotypic Profile Associated With the FMR1 Premutation in Women: An Investigation of Clinical-Behavioral, Social-Cognitive, and Executive Abilities.', 'The emerging role of RNA N6-methyladenosine methylation in breast cancer.', 'Curvilinear Association Between Language Disfluency and FMR1 CGG Repeat Size Across the Normal, Intermediate, and Premutation Range.']"""

The primary aim was to comparatively assess 2- and 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS). A secondary aim was to identify predictors of survival.  Patients and methods:   Data were acquired from the RECAP database, a population-based prostate cancer registry in Spain. Inclusion criteria included RP (with or without lymphadenectomy) followed by ART or SRT. A total of 702 patients were analyzed. Pre-RT PSA values (>0.5 vs. ≤0.5 ng/ml), pathological stage (T1-2 vs. T3-4), post-surgical Gleason score (≤7 vs. 8-10), margin status (positive vs. negative), hormonal treatment (yes vs. no), and RT dose (≤66 Gy vs. >66 Gy) were evaluated to assess their impact on BRFS.  Results:   The mean patient age in the ART and SRT groups, respectively, was 64 years (range 42-82) and 64.8 years (range 42-82). Median follow-up after RT in the whole sample was 34 months (range 3-141). A total of 702 patients were included: 223 (31.8%) received ART and 479 (68.2%) SRT. BRFS rates (95% CI) in the ART and SRT groups at months 24 and 60 were, respectively: 98.1% (95.9-100.0%) vs. 91.2% (88.2-94.2%) and 84.5% (76.4-92.6%) vs. 74.0% (67.4-80.7%) (p = 0.004). No significant differences in OS were observed (p = 0.053). The following variables were significant predictors of biochemical recurrence in the SRT group: (1) positive surgical margin status (p = 0.049); (2) no hormonotherapy (p = 0.03); (3) total prostate dose ≤66 Gy (p = 0.004); and pre-RT PSA ≥0.5 ng/ml (p = 0.013).  Conclusions:   This is the first nationwide study in Spain to evaluate a large cohort of PCa patients treated with RP followed by postoperative RT. ART yielded better 2- and 5-year BRFS rates, although OS was equivalent. These findings are consistent with most other published studies and support ART in patients with adverse prognostic characteristics after radical prostatectomy.

One promising approach is the antibody-based targeting of prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), which is frequently overexpressed in PCa. Here, we show the construction of a molecular imaging probe comprising a humanized scFv fragment recognizing PSCA genetically fused to an engineered version of the human DNA repair enzyme O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), the SNAP-tag, enabling specific covalent coupling to various fluorophores for diagnosis of PCa. Furthermore, the recombinant immunotoxin (IT) PSCA(scFv)-ETA' comprising the PSCA(scFv) and a truncated version of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE, ETA') was generated.  Methods:   We analyzed the specific binding and internalization behavior of the molecular imaging probe PSCA(scFv)-SNAP in vitro by flow cytometry and live cell imaging, compared to the corresponding IT PSCA(scFv)-ETA'. The cytotoxic activity of PSCA(scFv)-ETA' was tested using cell viability assays. Specific binding was confirmed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimen of early and advanced PCa.  Results:   Alexa Fluor® 647 labeling of PSCA(scFv)-SNAP confirmed selective binding to PSCA, leading to rapid internalization into the target cells. The recombinant IT PSCA(scFv)-ETA' showed selective binding leading to internalization and efficient elimination of target cells.  Conclusions:   Our data demonstrate, for the first time, the specific binding, internalization, and cytotoxicity of a scFv-based fusion protein targeting PSCA.

Current techniques in clinical routine, such as sandwich ELISA, provide sensitive protein detection because of a dependence on target recognition by pairs of antibodies, but detection of still lower protein concentrations is often called for. Proximity ligation assay with rolling circle amplification (PLARCA) is a modified proximity ligation assay (PLA) for analytically specific and sensitive protein detection via binding of target proteins by 3 antibodies, and signal amplification via rolling circle amplification (RCA) in microtiter wells, easily adapted to instrumentation in use in hospitals.  Methods:   Proteins captured by immobilized antibodies were detected using a pair of oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies. Upon target recognition these PLA probes guided oligonucleotide ligation, followed by amplification via RCA of circular DNA strands that formed in the reaction. The RCA products were detected by horseradish peroxidase-labeled oligonucleotides to generate colorimetric reaction products with readout in an absorbance microplate reader.  Results:   We compared detection of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-8, p53, and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) by PLARCA and conventional sandwich ELISA or immuno-RCA. PLARCA detected lower concentrations of proteins and exhibited a broader dynamic range compared to ELISA and iRCA using the same antibodies. IL-4 and IL-6 were detected in clinical samples at femtomolar concentrations, considerably lower than for ELISA.  Conclusions:   PLARCA offers detection of lower protein levels and increased dynamic ranges compared to ELISA.

Mutant p53 protein(s) (mutp53) can acquire oncogenic properties that increase metastasis, proliferation, and cell survival. We report that breast and prostate cancer cells with mutant p53 respond to insulin stimulation by increasing cell proliferation and invasivity, and that such a response depends on the presence of mutp53.

We also analyzed the Ki67 labeling index of Gleason pattern 3 adenocarcinoma associated with and without cribriform adenocarcinoma. Among Gleason pattern 4 morphologies, cribriform adenocarcinoma exhibited a higher mean proliferation index at 5.3% compared to fused gland adenocarcinoma at 3.9% (P = .03) and poorly formed glands at 3.6% (P < .01). The mean Ki67 labeling index for Gleason pattern 3 associated with cribriform adenocarcinoma was higher at 4.1% compared to pure Gleason pattern 3 at 2.2% (P < .01) and Gleason pattern 3 associated with non-cribriform pattern 4 adenocarcinoma at 2.9% (P = .02). This higher proliferation index of Gleason pattern 3 adenocarcinoma associated with cribriform pattern 4 adenocarcinoma indicates that not all Gleason pattern 3 cells are identical and that cribriform adenocarcinoma may influence or be related to associated Gleason pattern 3. Gleason pattern 4 adenocarcinoma of the prostate with cribriform growth has a higher proliferation index than other grade 4 histomorphologies, consistent with the more clinically aggressive nature of cribriform adenocarcinoma of the prostate.""","""['Liying Fu', 'Michael Hwang', 'Adebowale J Adeniran', 'Peter A Humphrey']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Architectural heterogeneity and cribriform pattern predict adverse clinical outcome for Gleason grade 4 prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Usual and unusual histologic patterns of high Gleason score 8 to 10 adenocarcinoma of the prostate in needle biopsy tissue.', 'High-grade foamy gland prostatic adenocarcinoma on biopsy or transurethral resection: a morphologic study of 55 cases.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Prostate cancer with cribriform morphology: diagnosis, aggressiveness, molecular pathology and possible relationships with intraductal carcinoma.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'Cribriform Prostate Cancer: Clinical Pathologic and Molecular Considerations.', 'Syntaphilin Is a Novel Biphasic Biomarker of Aggressive Prostate Cancer and a Metastasis Predictor.']"""

Conformal RT (CRT) is potentially more complex and expensive than NCRT, but may reduce normal tissue dose and subsequently toxicity. In this retrospective analysis, we compared CRT with NCRT to investigate the association between conformality and toxicity.  Methods and materials:   A retrospective analysis of patients receiving palliative RT for axial skeletal bone metastases from 2012 to 2014 was conducted. Patient and treatment characteristics were obtained including dosimetric variables, acute toxicity, and subjective pain during treatment and in the acute posttreatment period (≤60 days after completion). Statistical analyses included t tests, χ2 tests, and multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   A total of 179 patients and 254 bone metastases were identified (142 CRT, 112 NCRT). The CRT and NCRT groups were well matched for baseline characteristics (number of fractions, field size, treatment sites, and concurrent chemotherapy). In multivariate logistic regression models, technique (CRT vs NCRT) was not associated with development of acute toxicity. Regarding toxicity, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and total dose were significantly associated with a higher rate of acute toxicity during RT (odds ratios, 0.649 and 1.129 and P = .027 and .044, respectively), and only a higher number of vertebral bodies in the treatment field was significantly associated with acute toxicity post-treatment (odds ratios, 1.219, P = .028). CRT was associated with improvement in bone pain during and posttreatment (P = .049 and .045, respectively).  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate no difference in acute toxicity following palliative RT with CRT compared with NCRT for painful bone metastases; however, treatment volume did predict for increased toxicity. Larger studies may further elucidate the value of CRT including the impact of dose escalation for bone metastases and differences in patient reported outcomes between RT techniques.""","""['Kara D Romano', 'Daniel M Trifiletti', 'Kristine Bauer-Nilsen', 'Nolan A Wages', 'William T Watkins', 'Paul W Read', 'Timothy N Showalter']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Digestive toxicities after palliative three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) for cervico-thoracic spinal metastases.', 'Preliminary toxicity analysis of 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy versus intensity modulated radiation therapy on the high-dose arm of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0126 prostate cancer trial.', 'A randomized study of intensity-modulated radiation therapy versus three dimensional conformal radiation therapy for pelvic radiation in patients of post-operative treatment with gynecologic malignant tumor.', 'Interventions to reduce acute and late adverse gastrointestinal effects of pelvic radiotherapy for primary pelvic cancers.', 'A shift from simple to sophisticated: using intensity-modulated radiation therapy in conventional nonstereotactic palliative radiotherapy.', 'The Palliative Care in the Metastatic Spinal Tumors.

The antiproliferative effect of these acetanilides was evaluated against human breast (MCF-7) and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cell lines as well as normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). In particular, acetoacetanilides with methylcyclohexyl and/or 2,4-dimethylbenzyl groups linked to amide group and/or to sulfur atom had interesting cytotoxicities against human breast cancer cells. Moreover, these groups caused an increase in the antiproliferative effect against both cancer cells. Docking studies revealed the possibility of these acetoacetanilides to be potential ligands of the androgen receptor, though hormone-independent mechanisms may be involved in antiproliferative effects shown by these acetoacetanilides.

During the screening of natural products to identify STAT3 inhibitors, we identified geranylnaringenin (CG902), which decreased luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. CG902 specifically inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr-705 in DU145 prostate cancer cells and decreased the expression levels of STAT3 target genes, such as cyclin D1, cyclin A, and survivin. Notably, the knockdown of the SHP-2 gene by small interfering RNA suppressed the ability of CG902 to inhibit STAT3 activation and CG902 activated the phosphatase activity of SHP-2 through direct interaction with SHP-2 and induced the phosphorylation of SHP-2. The interactions between CG902 and SHP-2 were confirmed by pull-down assay using biotinylated CG902. The interactions were also further validated by the drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). The inhibitory effect of CG902 on cell growth was confirmed using the DU145 mouse xenograft model. We propose that CG902 inhibits STAT3 activity through a mechanism that involves the interactions between CG902 and SHP-2, and the phosphorylation of SHP-2, which leads to SHP-2 activation in DU145 cells. CG902 is the first compound to regulate STAT3 activity via the modulation of SHP-2 activity, and our results suggest that CG902 is a novel inhibitor of the STAT3 pathway and an activator of SHP-2, and may be a useful lead molecule for the development of a therapeutic STAT3 inhibitor.""","""['Yena Jin', 'Yae Jin Yoon', 'Yoon Jung Jeon', 'Jiyeon Choi', 'Yu-Jin Lee', 'Joonku Lee', 'Sangho Choi', 'Oyekanmi Nash', 'Dong Cho Han', 'Byoung-Mog Kwon']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Acacetin Inhibits the Growth of STAT3-Activated DU145 Prostate Cancer Cells by Directly Binding to Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3).', 'Sugiol inhibits STAT3 activity via regulation of transketolase and ROS-mediated ERK activation in DU145 prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Ethacrynic acid inhibits STAT3 activity through the modulation of SHP2 and PTP1B tyrosine phosphatases in DU145 prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Alteration of SHP-1/p-STAT3 Signaling: A Potential Target for Anticancer Therapy.', 'STAT3 targeting by polyphenols: Novel therapeutic strategy for melanoma.', 'New opportunities and challenges of natural products research: When target identification meets single-cell multiomics.', 'Targeting protein phosphatases for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases: From signaling to therapy.', 'An update of label-free protein target identification methods for natural active products.', 'Osteosarcoma cell proliferation suppression via SHP-2-mediated inactivation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway by tubocapsenolide A.', 'Acacetin Inhibits the Growth of STAT3-Activated DU145 Prostate Cancer Cells by Directly Binding to Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3).']"""

However, many cancer patients still turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment. This study explored the prevalence, patterns, and perceived value of CAM among cancer patients.  Methods:   This quantitative descriptive study was conducted between March 1, 2015, and July 31, 2015, among a cross-sectional, convenience sample of patients from the Oncology Department of San Fernando General Hospital in Trinidad and Tobago. Face-to-face interviews were conducted at the oncology clinic and treatment suite after obtaining informed consent. Data analysis included descriptive analysis, chi-square tests, and binary logistic regression analysis.  Results:   The prevalence of CAM use among a sample of 350 cancer patients was 39.1% (39.6% for breast cancer, 44.4% for prostate cancer, 37% for ovarian cancer, and 38.7% for colon cancer patients). Herbs were the most common type of CAM used (93.4%), followed by spiritual therapy (73.7%). CAM use was more prevalent among females (68.6%), Indo-Trinidadians (63.5%), and patients aged 41-50 years (37.2%). The majority (70%-80%) rated CAM efficacy on perceived value. CAM was used mainly because of a desire to try anything that might help (67.6%), followed by it being congruent with the patients' beliefs (59.1%). Patients knew about CAM mainly through friends (69.3%) and family (69.3%). Most patients were generally satisfied (93.6%) and considered CAM helpful (89.8%), but the majority never informed their health care provider of CAM use (78.8%). Patients reported the simultaneous use of more than one type of CAM, without considering or knowing of possible side-effects. The perceived value of CAM included empowerment, control, cure, and improved quality of life. CAM use was associated with age, but no predictors of CAM use could be identified.  Conclusion:   Medicinal herbs and spiritual therapy are commonly used among cancer patients because of perceived benefits and satisfaction. CAM use is more prevalent among females, Indo-Trinidadians, and patients aged 41-50 years old. There are no useful predictors of CAM use.

Given the high dimensionality that typically characterises these data, relevant knowledge is often hidden and hard to identify. Machine learning methods, and particularly feature selection algorithms, have proven very effective over the years at identifying small but relevant subsets of variables from a variety of application domains, including -omics data. Many methods exist with varying trade-off between the size of the identified variable subsets and the predictive power of such subsets. In this paper we focus on an heuristic for the identification of biomarkers called RGIFE: Rank Guided Iterative Feature Elimination. RGIFE is guided in its biomarker identification process by the information extracted from machine learning models and incorporates several mechanisms to ensure that it creates minimal and highly predictive features sets.  Results:   We compare RGIFE against five well-known feature selection algorithms using both synthetic and real (cancer-related transcriptomics) datasets. First, we assess the ability of the methods to identify relevant and highly predictive features. Then, using a prostate cancer dataset as a case study, we look at the biological relevance of the identified biomarkers.  Conclusions:   We propose RGIFE, a heuristic for the inference of reduced panels of biomarkers that obtains similar predictive performance to widely adopted feature selection methods while selecting significantly fewer feature. Furthermore, focusing on the case study, we show the higher biological relevance of the biomarkers selected by our approach.

Unfortunately, patient motion causes targeting errors when using an MR-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion approach to augment the conventional biopsy procedure. This study aims to develop an automatic motion correction algorithm approaching the frame rate of an ultrasound system to be used in fusion-based prostate biopsy systems. Two modes of operation have been investigated for the clinical implementation of the algorithm: motion compensation using a single user initiated correction performed prior to biopsy, and real-time continuous motion compensation performed automatically as a background process.  Methods:   Retrospective 2D and 3D TRUS patient images acquired prior to biopsy gun firing were registered using an intensity-based algorithm utilizing normalized cross-correlation and Powell's method for optimization. 2D and 3D images were downsampled and cropped to estimate the optimal amount of image information that would perform registrations quickly and accurately. The optimal search order during optimization was also analyzed to avoid local optima in the search space. Error in the algorithm was computed using target registration errors (TREs) from manually identified homologous fiducials in a clinical patient dataset. The algorithm was evaluated for real-time performance using the two different modes of clinical implementations by way of user initiated and continuous motion compensation methods on a tissue mimicking prostate phantom.  Results:   After implementation in a TRUS-guided system with an image downsampling factor of 4, the proposed approach resulted in a mean ± std TRE and computation time of 1.6 ± 0.6 mm and 57 ± 20 ms respectively. The user initiated mode performed registrations with in-plane, out-of-plane, and roll motions computation times of 108 ± 38 ms, 60 ± 23 ms, and 89 ± 27 ms, respectively, and corresponding registration errors of 0.4 ± 0.3 mm, 0.2 ± 0.4 mm, and 0.8 ± 0.5°. The continuous method performed registration significantly faster (P < 0.05) than the user initiated method, with observed computation times of 35 ± 8 ms, 43 ± 16 ms, and 27 ± 5 ms for in-plane, out-of-plane, and roll motions, respectively, and corresponding registration errors of 0.2 ± 0.3 mm, 0.7 ± 0.4 mm, and 0.8 ± 1.0°.  Conclusions:   The presented method encourages real-time implementation of motion compensation algorithms in prostate biopsy with clinically acceptable registration errors. Continuous motion compensation demonstrated registration accuracy with submillimeter and subdegree error, while performing < 50 ms computation times. Image registration technique approaching the frame rate of an ultrasound system offers a key advantage to be smoothly integrated to the clinical workflow.

An important decrease of sphincteric capability was evident after prostate removal and the following urethrovesical anastomosis, while proper sling tensioning allowed for restoration of sphincteric apparatus capability to its presurgical status (mean RLPPs 40.84 cmH2O vs RLPPp 40.39 cmH2O, p = 0.942). EUC recovery within 10 days after catheter removal was achieved in 59 (77%) patients and progressively improved over time.  Conclusions:   RPS, intraoperatively performed during RALP, allows for precise evaluation of the impact of the surgical procedure on sphincteric apparatus competence. Moreover, the use of the 6-branch suburethral sling, in association with RPS, allows for restoration of the proper supporting system to the urethral sphincter, similar to the preoperative condition, offering the basis for EUC recovery after radical prostate surgery.""","""['Andrea Cestari', 'Davide Soranna', 'Giuseppe Zanni', 'Antonella Zambon', 'Matteo Zanoni', 'Mattia Sangalli', 'Massimo Ghezzi', 'Fabio Fabbri', 'Francesco Sozzi', ""Vincenzo Dell'Acqua"", 'Patrizio Rigatti']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Editorial Comment on: Intraoperative Retrograde Perfusion Sphincterometry to Evaluate Efficacy of Autologous Vas Deferens 6-Branch Suburethral Sling to Properly Restore Sphincteric Apparatus During Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy by Cestari et al.', 'Proper 6-branch suburethral autologous sling tensioning during robotic assisted radical prostatectomy with the intraopeartive use of retrograde perfusion sphincterometry: the technique.', 'Retropubic Intracorporeal Placement of a Suburethral Autologous Sling During Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy to Improve Early Urinary Continence Recovery: Preliminary Data.', 'Editorial Comment on: Intraoperative Retrograde Perfusion Sphincterometry to Evaluate Efficacy of Autologous Vas Deferens 6-Branch Suburethral Sling to Properly Restore Sphincteric Apparatus During Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy by Cestari et al.', 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'Posterior musculofascial reconstruction in robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localised prostate cancer: a Cochrane Review.', 'Robotic Surgery Techniques to Improve Traditional Laparoscopy.', ""Preservation of continence in radical prostatectomy patients: a laparoscopic surgeon's perspective.""]"""

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed at 9.4 T with three radical prostatectomy specimens, with diffusion times in the range 10-120 ms and b-values 0-3000 s/mm2 . ADC and FA were calculated from DTI measurements at b-values of 800 and 1600 s/mm2 . Independently, a two-component model (restricted isotropic plus Gaussian anisotropic) was used to synthesize DTI data, from which ADC and FA were predicted and compared with the measured values. Measured ADC and FA exhibited a diffusion time dependence, which was closely predicted by the two-component model. ADC decreased by about 0.10-0.15 μm2 /ms as diffusion time increased from 10 to 120 ms. FA increased with diffusion time at b-values of 800 and 1600 s/mm2 but was predicted to be independent of diffusion time at b = 3000 s/mm2 . Both ADC and FA exhibited diffusion time dependence that could be modeled as two unmixed water pools - one having isotropic restricted dynamics, and the other unrestricted anisotropic dynamics. These results highlight the importance of considering and reporting diffusion times in conventional ADC and FA calculations and protocol recommendations, and inform the development of improved diffusion methods for prostate cancer imaging.""","""['Roger Bourne', 'Sisi Liang', 'Eleftheria Panagiotaki', 'Andre Bongers', 'Paul Sved', 'Geoffrey Watson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['Comparison of the diagnostic performances of diffusion parameters in diffusion weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging of breast lesions.', 'Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging of the normal breast: reproducibility of DTI-derived fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient at 3.0 T.', 'Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging of the normal breast.', 'The role of diffusion tensor imaging in the evaluation of ischemic brain injury - a review.', 'The role of diffusion tensor imaging and fractional anisotropy in the evaluation of patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a literature review.', 'Acquisition Parameters Influence Diffusion Metrics Effectiveness in Probing Prostate Tumor and Age-Related Microstructure.', 'Combined diffusion-relaxometry microstructure imaging: Current status and future prospects.', 'Non-Gaussian models of diffusion weighted imaging for detection and characterization of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'In Vivo 3D MRI Measurement of Tumour Volume in an Orthotopic Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'Accelerated Segmented Diffusion-Weighted Prostate Imaging for Higher Resolution, Higher Geometric Fidelity, and Multi-b Perfusion Estimation.']"""

However, the performance of phi remains unknown in patients with PSA >10 ng/mL, the vast majority in Chinese biopsy patients. We aimed to assess the ability of phi to predict prostate cancer (PCa) and high-grade disease (Gleason Score ≥7) on biopsy in a Chinese population.  Methods:   This is a prospective, observational, multi-center study of consecutive patients who underwent a transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy at four hospitals in Shanghai, China from August 2013 to December 2014.  Results:   In the cohort of 1538 patients, the detection rate of PCa was 40.2%. phi had a significantly better predictive performance for PCa than total PSA (tPSA). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were 0.90 and 0.79 for phi and tPSA, respectively, P < 0.0001. A considerable proportion of patients in the cohort had PSAs >10 ng/mL (N = 838, 54.5%). The detection rates of PCa were 35.9% and 57.7% in patients with tPSA 10.1-20 and 20.1-50 ng/mL, respectively. The AUCs of phi (0.79 and 0.89, for these two groups, respectively) were also significantly higher than tPSA (0.57 and 0.63, respectively), both P < 0.0001. If a phi ≤35 was used as the cutoff, 599/1538 (39%) biopsies could have been avoided at a cost of missing small numbers of PCa patients: 49 (7.93%) PCa patients, including 18 (3.69%) high-grade tumors.

The locus shows allele-specific activity that is concomitantly modulated by androgen receptor and by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) beta (CEBPB). Deletion of this locus via CRISPR-Cas9 leads to deregulation of the genes predicted to interact with the 7p14.3 locus by Hi-C chromosome conformation capture data.

One proposed mechanism is incomplete androgen ablation. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficiency of serum hydroxy-androgen suppression in patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer under NADT (leuprolide acetate plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone) and interrogate the primary sources of circulating hydroxy-androgens using our recently described stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography mass spectrometric method. For the first time, three androgen diols including 5-androstene-3β,17β-diol (5-adiol), 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-adiol), 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol (3β-adiol), the glucuronide or sulfate conjugate of 5-adiol and 3α-adiol were measured and observed to be dramatically reduced after NADT. By comparing patients that took leuprolide acetate alone vs leuprolide acetate plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone, we were able to distinguish the primary sources of these androgens and their conjugates as being of either testicular or adrenal in origin. We find that testosterone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 3α-adiol and 3β-adiol were predominately of testicular origin. By contrast, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), epi-androsterone (epi-AST) and their conjugates, 5-adiol sulfate and glucuronide were predominately of adrenal origin.

In PREVAIL, an international, phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, enzalutamide significantly reduced the risk of radiographic progression by 81% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.19; P < .0001) and reduced the risk of death by 29% (HR, 0.71; P < .0001) compared with placebo in chemotherapy-naïve men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   To evaluate treatment effects, safety, and pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in East Asian patients from the PREVAIL trial, we performed a post hoc analysis of the Japanese, Korean, and Singaporean patients. PREVAIL enrolled patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had progressed on androgen deprivation therapy. During the study, patients received enzalutamide (160 mg/d) or placebo (1:1) until death or discontinuation because of radiographic progression or skeletal-related event and initiation of subsequent therapy. Centrally assessed radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) were coprimary endpoints.

Self-determination theory, a framework of self-initiated extrinsic behaviors, was applied to test mediation models of PCC and EHR use, respectively, through patient activation. The results demonstrated that PCC and EHR use predicted cancer screening (mediated through patient activation), but only for women recommended for biannual mammograms. The aforementioned relationship was not found for men who are recommended for prostate cancer screening. PCC and EHRs do appear to facilitate a patient's ability to take care of their own health, but only under certain circumstances. It was additionally found that men were more likely to report higher degrees of physician PCC when their physicians maintained an EHR, whereas women reported no difference.

The relationships between Tim-3 expression and clinicopathological features were analyzed. Immunohistochemical expression of Tim-3 was examined in our large numbers of paraffin-fixed prostate tissues. Flow cytometry revealed that expression of Tim-3 was significantly increased on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in prostate cancer patients than that in benign prostate hyperplasia patients. Also, the level of Tim-3 on CD4+ T cells was positively correlated with CD8+ T cells in patients. Further analyses revealed that the levels of Tim-3 on CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells exhibited different expression patterns in terms of localization depending on pathological category of prostate cancer and metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that positive staining of Tim-3 in prostate cancer but little or no staining of Tim-3 was observed in benign prostate hyperplasia epithelium.

To identify MGL from different sources with high catalytic activity and efficient anticancer action, we have expressed and characterized MGL from Clostridium novyi and compared its catalytic efficiency with the previously studied MGL from Citrobacter freundii. The purified recombinant MGL exhibits kcat and kcat /Km for methionine γ-elimination reaction that are 2.4- and 1.36-fold higher than C. freundii enzyme, respectively, whereas absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectra are very similar, as expected on the basis of 87% sequence identity and high conservation of active site residues. The reactivity of cysteine residues with DTNB and iodoacetamide was investigated as well as the impact of their chemical modification on catalytic activity. This information is relevant because for increasing bioavailability and reducing immunogenity, MGL should be decorated with polyethylene glycol (PEG). It was found that Cys118 is a faster reacting residue, which results in a significant decrease in the γ-elimination activity. Thus, the protection of Cys118 before conjugation with cysteine-reacting PEG represents a valuable strategy to preserve MGL activity. The anticancer action of C. novyi MGL, evaluated in vitro against prostate (PC-3), chronic myelogenous leucemia (K562), and breast (MDA-MB-231 and MCF7) cancer cells, exhibits IC50 of 1.3 U mL-1 , 4.4 U mL-1 , 1.2 U mL-1 , and 3.4 U mL-1 , respectively.

Hazard regression and competing risk analyses were used to determine the association of the etiology of incontinence with device outcomes.  Results:   The distribution of the 4 etiologies of incontinence included: 598 patients (64.6%) treated with prostatectomy alone, 206 (22.2%) with prostatectomy and pelvic radiation therapy, 104 (11.2%) with benign prostate resection, and 17 (1.8%) with prior cryotherapy.

Little is known about socioeconomic disparities at the end of life and how they affect health care costs. This study examines disparities in end-of-life treatment costs for cancer patients in England. Analyzing data on over 250,000 colorectal, breast, prostate, and lung cancer patients from multiple national databases, we found evidence illustrating that disparities are driven largely by the greater use of emergency inpatient care among patients of lower socioeconomic status. Even within a system with free health care, differences in the use of care create disparities in cancer costs.

Nkx3.1 is ubiquitously expressed in luminal cells of hormonally intact prostate but, upon androgen deprivation, exclusively labels a type of luminal stem cells named castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells (CARNs). During prostate cancer initiation, Nkx3.1 expression is frequently lost in both humans and mouse models. Therefore, investigating how Nkx3.1 expression is regulated in vivo is important for understanding the mechanisms of prostate stem cell specification and cancer initiation. Here, using a transgenic mouse line with destabilized GFP, we identified an 11-kb genomic region 3' of the Nkx3.1 transcription start site to be responsible for alterations in Nkx3.1 expression patterns under various physiological conditions. We found that androgen cell-autonomously activates Nkx3.1 expression through androgen receptor (AR) binding to the 11-kb region in both normal luminal cells and CARNs and discovered new androgen response elements in the Nkx3.1 3' UTR.

Methods:   In total, 598 consecutive patients underwent transperineal prostate biopsy. The medication group comprised patients who took anti-thromboembolic agents, and the control group comprised those who did not take these agents. No anti-thromboembolic agent was stopped before, during, or after prostate biopsy in the medication group. Complications developing in both groups were compared and classified using the modified Clavien classification system. Subgroup analyses to compare complications in patients taking single antiplatelet, single anticoagulant, and dual antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents, and multivariate analyses to predict bleeding risk were also performed.  Results:   Of the 598 eligible patients, 149 comprised the medication group and 449 comprised the control group. Hematuria (Grade I) developed in 88 (59.1%) and 236 (52.5%) patients in the medication and control group, respectively (p = 0.18). Clot retention (Grade I) was more frequently observed in the medication group than the controls (2.0% versus 0.2%, respectively, p < 0.05). Hospitalization was more frequently prolonged in the medication than the control group (4.0% versus 0.4% of patients, respectively). No complication of Grade III or higher developed in either group. Hematuria was more frequent in patients taking a single anticoagulant (p = 0.007) or two anti-thromboembolic agents (p = 0.04) compared with those taking a single antiplatelet agent. Other complications were generally similar among the groups. In the multivariate analysis, taking more than two anti-thromboembolic agents was the only significant risk factor for bleeding events.  Conclusion:   No severe complication developed after the transperineal biopsies in either group, although minor bleeding was somewhat more frequent in the medication group.

Methods:   A total of 101 consecutive patients suspicious of prostate cancer (PCa) at the mpMRI scan and with prior negative biopsy and elevated PSA values were prospectively recruited at two urological centers. Suspicious areas on mpMRI were defined and graded using PI-RADS score. Targeted biopsies (TB) were performed for each suspicious lesion and followed a 12-core systematic biopsy (SB). Results of biopsy pathology and whole-gland pathology at prostatectomy were analyzed and compared between TB and SB. The risk for biopsy positivity was assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Results:   Fusion biopsy revealed PCa in 41 of 101 men (40.6%) and 25 (24.8%) were clinically significant. There was exact agreement between TB and SB in 74 (73.3%) men.

Purpose To compare mpMRI score subgroups to systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies (TRUSbx) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based findings for detection of csPCa in men undergoing repeat biopsies. Material and Methods MpMRI was performed prior to re-biopsy in 289 prospectively enrolled patients. All underwent repeat TRUSbx followed by targeted biopsies (MRITB) of any mpMRI-identified lesion. MpMRI suspicion grade, PSA level, and density (PSAd) were compared with biopsy results and further matched to the radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen if available. Results PCa was detected in 128/289 (44%) patients with median age, PSA, and prior negative TRUSbx of 64 (interquartile range [IQR] = 59-67), 12.0 ng/mL (IQR = 8.3-19.1), and 2 (IQR = 1-3), respectively. TRUSbx detected PCa in 108/289 (37%) patients, of which 49 (45%) had insignificant cancer. MRITB was performed in 271/289 (94%) patients and detected PCa in 96 (35%) with 78 (81%) having csPCa. MpMRI scores showed a high association between suspicion level and biopsy results on both lesion and patient level ( P < 0.001). MpMRI was better than PSA and PSAd ( P < 0.001) to identify patients with missed csPCa. In total, 64/128 (50%) patients underwent RP; 60/64 had csPCa.

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of TRUSBx in a small cohort of patients with CD.  Methods:   We queried our institutional database clinical data of patients with a diagnosis of CD undergoing TRUSBx, and a retrospective prospective study of 5 patients was planned. All patients enrolled were in the remission phase of CD and asymptomatic. They received the same antibiotic prophylaxis and a povidone-iodine aqueous solution enema before the procedure. A standardized reproducible technique was used with using a ultrasound machine equipped with a 5-9 MHz multifrequency convex probe ""end-fire"". The patients were treated under local anaesthesia, and a 14-core biopsy scheme was performed in each patient as first intention. After the procedure each patient was given a verbal numeric pain scale to evaluate tolerability of TRUSBx.  Results:   TRUSBx was successfully completed in all patients. The number of biopsy cores was 14 (12-16). Of the 5 biopsy procedures performed 40% revealed prostatic carcinoma (PCa) with a Gleason score 6 (3+3). No patients required catheterization or admission to the hospital for adverse events after the procedure. The most frequent adverse event was hematospermia (60%), while hematuria was present in 20% of patients and a minimal rectal bleeding in 20% of the patients. No patients reported severe or unbearable pain (score ≥ 8).

Retinoic Acid Receptor Responder (RARRES1)/ Tazarotene-induced gene-1 (TIG-1) is a putative tumor suppressor gene that exerts its tumor suppressor function via unknown mechanisms. Epigenetic silencing of RARRES1 leads to its loss in several types of cancer, including PCa. Determining the molecular mechanisms that mediate the tumor suppressor role of RARRES1 in PCa is the focus of our study.  Findings:   Our data indicates that RARRES1 over expression in PCa cell lines represses mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. RARRES1 expression induces the levels of autophagy-related genes, beclin, ATG3 and increases LC3B-II conversion. A significant induction of SIRT1 along with mTOR inhibition is noted on RARRES1 expression. Furthermore, RARRES1 over expression elevates the levels of the antioxidant enzyme, catalase. Our results also indicate that RARRES1 expression inhibits angiogenesis in endothelial cells.  Conclusions:   In summary, the data presented here indicate that forced expression of RARRES1 in PCa cells (a) induces ER stress and autophagic response; (b) increases SIRT1 levels; and (c) higher levels of anti-oxidant enzymes. Our study also implicates the role of RARRES1 as a novel anti-angiogenic molecule. Overall this study reports the molecular players that RARRES1 modulates to serve as a tumor suppressor molecule. Future studies will help determine the in vivo mechanisms by which RARRES1 may serve as a target for therapeutic intervention both in cancer and in angiogenesis-related disorders.""","""['Arpita Roy', 'Malathi Ramalinga', 'Okjin J Kim', 'Juliet Chijioke', 'Solomon Lynch', 'Stephen Byers', 'Deepak Kumar']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Lutein Induces Autophagy via Beclin-1 Upregulation in IEC-6 Rat Intestinal Epithelial Cells.', 'Hypermethylation and loss of retinoic acid receptor responder 1 expression in human choriocarcinoma.', 'Tazarotene-Induced Gene 1 Enhanced Cervical Cell Autophagy through Transmembrane Protein 192.', ""Impaired autophagy and APP processing in Alzheimer's disease: The potential role of Beclin 1 interactome."", 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Loss of RARRES1 function Promotes Follicular Lymphomagenesis and Inhibits B cell Differentiation in Mice.', 'Bioinformatics analysis reveals the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) coexpression network in the tumor microenvironment and prognostic biomarkers in soft tissue sarcomas.', 'Identification of a novel six autophagy-related genes signature for the prognostic and a miRNA-related autophagy predictor for anti-PD-1 therapy responses in prostate cancer.', 'sFRP2 Supersedes VEGF as an Age-related Driver of Angiogenesis in Melanoma, Affecting Response to Anti-VEGF Therapy in Older Patients.', 'Expression of Retinoid Acid Receptor-Responsive Genes in Rodent Models of Placental Pathology.']"""

A high-mesenchymal cell state observed in human tumours and cancer cell lines has been associated with resistance to multiple treatment modalities across diverse cancer lineages, but the mechanistic underpinning for this state has remained incompletely understood. Here we molecularly characterize this therapy-resistant high-mesenchymal cell state in human cancer cell lines and organoids and show that it depends on a druggable lipid-peroxidase pathway that protects against ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death induced by the build-up of toxic lipid peroxides. We show that this cell state is characterized by activity of enzymes that promote the synthesis of polyunsaturated lipids. These lipids are the substrates for lipid peroxidation by lipoxygenase enzymes. This lipid metabolism creates a dependency on pathways converging on the phospholipid glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), a selenocysteine-containing enzyme that dissipates lipid peroxides and thereby prevents the iron-mediated reactions of peroxides that induce ferroptotic cell death. Dependency on GPX4 was found to exist across diverse therapy-resistant states characterized by high expression of ZEB1, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition in epithelial-derived carcinomas, TGFβ-mediated therapy-resistance in melanoma, treatment-induced neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in prostate cancer, and sarcomas, which are fixed in a mesenchymal state owing to their cells of origin.

Decisional regret after treatment is a concern, especially when poor oncologic outcomes or declines in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) occur. This study assessed determinants of longitudinal decisional regret in prostate cancer patients attending a multidisciplinary clinic and treated with radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT), or active surveillance (AS).  Methods:   Patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who attended a multidisciplinary clinic were enrolled into a prospective study from 2006 to 2014. The Decision Regret Scale was administered at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months posttreatment. HRQoL was also assessed at regular intervals using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and 36-item RAND Medical Outcomes Study Short Form questionnaires. Adjusted probabilities of reporting regret were estimated via multivariable logistic regression fitted with generalized estimating equations.  Results:   A total of 652 patients met the inclusion criteria (395 RP, 141 EBRT, 41 BT, 75 AS). Decisional regret was consistently low after all of these treatments. In multivariable models, only African American race (odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.47) was associated with greater regret across time. Age and control preference were marginally associated with regret. Regret scores were similar between RP patients who did and did not experience biochemical recurrence. Declines in HRQoL were weakly correlated with greater decisional regret.  Conclusion:   In the context of a multidisciplinary clinic, decisional regret did not differ significantly between treatment groups but was greater in African Americans and those reporting poorer HRQoL.

The study aimed to evaluate the effects of lncRNA625/miR-432 on the prostate cancer cells and the underlying molecular mechanism.  Patients and methods:   The cell proliferation was detected using the MTT and colony formation, and cells apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed with the ﬂow cytometry. Luciferase reporter assay was carried out to detect the correlation between miR-432 and TRIM29 and PYGO2. Besides, reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot were performed to detect the mRNA and protein levels in prostate tissues and PC3 cells.  Results:   lncRNA625 and miR-432 levels were consistently reduced in the PCa tissues compared with the healthy control and lncRNA625 levels significantly affect the miR-432 expression in PC3 cells, indicating that miR-432 is a direct target of lncRNA625. Besides, lncRNA625 overexpression could inhibit the cancer cells growth, arresting cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase, and significantly induce apoptosis of PC3 cells, but reversed by the miR-432 inhibitor. Most importantly, we further found that miR-432 could deactivate Wnt/β-catenin pathway via suppressing TRIM29 and PYGO2 directly.  Conclusions:   lncRNA625 could functionally inhibit PC3 cells proliferation and promote cells apoptosis through regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by targeting miR-432.""","""['J-B Li', 'F Liu', 'B-P Zhang', 'W-K Bai', 'W Cheng', 'Y-H Zhang', 'L-J Yu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['CircLMTK2 acts as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer via regulating the expression of microRNA-183.', 'MiR-182 promotes prostate cancer progression through activating Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway.', 'miR-15a-3p Suppresses Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation and Invasion by Targeting SLC39A7 Via Downregulating Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.', 'MicroRNA-744 promotes prostate cancer progression through aberrantly activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'TERF1 downregulation promotes the migration and invasion of the PC3 prostate cancer cell line as a target of miR‑155.', 'Long non-coding RNA SNHG3 promotes prostate cancer progression by sponging microRNA-1827.', 'Comparative Pathobiology of Canine and Human Prostate Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions.', 'Crosstalk between Long Non Coding RNAs, microRNAs and DNA Damage Repair in Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities?', 'Circ_0132817 facilitates cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis by regulating the miR-432-5p/NOL4L axis in neuroblastoma.', 'Long Intergenic Non-Coding RNA LINC00885 Promotes Tumorigenesis of Cervical Cancer by Upregulating MACC1 Expression Through Serving as a Competitive Endogenous RNA for microRNA-432-5p.']"""

This work reports the encapsulation of the lead metallodrug of ibuprofen (HIbp), [Ru2(Ibp)4Cl] or RuIbp, and also of the new analogue of naproxen (HNpx), [Ru2(Npx)4Cl] or RuNpx, in novel intravenously (i.v.) injectable solid polymer-lipid nanoparticles (SPLNs). A rationally selected composition of lipids/polymers rendered nearly spherical Ru2(NSAID)-SPLNs with a mean size of 120 nm and zeta potential of about -20 mV. The Ru2(NSAID)-SPLNs are characterized by spectroscopic techniques and the composition in terms of ruthenium-drug species is analyzed by mass spectrometry. The metallodrug-loaded nanoparticles showed high drug loading (17-18%) with ∼100% drug loading efficiency, and good colloidal stability in serum at body temperature. Fluorescence-labeled SPLNs were taken up by the cancer cells in a time- and energy-dependent manner as analyzed by confocal microscopy and fluorescence spectrometry. The Ru2(NSAID)-SPLNs showed enhanced cytotoxicity (IC50 at 60-100 μmol L-1 ) in relation to the corresponding Ru2(NSAID) metallodrugs in breast (EMT6 and MDA-MB-231) and prostate (DU145) cancer cells in vitro. The cell viability of both metallodrug nanoformulations is also compared with those of the parent NSAIDs, HIbp and HNpx, and their corresponding NSAID-SPLNs. In vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging revealed good biodistribution and high tumor accumulation of fluorescence-labeled SPLNs following i.v. injection in an orthotopic breast tumor model. The enhanced anticancer activity of the metallodrug-loaded SPLNs in these cell lines can be associated with the advantages of the nanoformulations, assigned mainly to the stability of the colloidal nanoparticles suitable for i.v. injection and enhanced cellular uptake. The findings of this work encourage future in vivo efficacy studies to further exploit the potential of the novel Ru2(NSAID)-SPLN nanoformulations for clinical application.""","""['Samara R Alves Rico', 'Azhar Z Abbasi', 'Geise Ribeiro', 'Taksim Ahmed', 'Xiao Yu Wu', 'Denise de Oliveira Silva']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Synthesis of terpolymer-lipid encapsulated diruthenium(II,III)-anti-inflammatory metallodrug nanoparticles to enhance activity against glioblastoma cancer cells.', 'A novel μ-oxo-diruthenium(III,III)-ibuprofen-(4-aminopyridine) chloride derived from the diruthenium(II,III)-ibuprofen paddlewheel metallodrug shows anticancer properties.', 'Axially-modified paddlewheel diruthenium(II,III)-ibuprofenato metallodrugs and the influence of the structural modification on U87MG and A172 human glioma cell proliferation, apoptosis, mitosis and migration.', 'Breast Cancer Chemotherapeutic Options: A General Overview on the Preclinical Validation of a Multi-Target Ruthenium(III) Complex Lodged in Nucleolipid Nanosystems.', 'Ferritin-based anticancer metallodrug delivery: Crystallographic, analytical and cytotoxicity studies.', 'Triphenyltin(IV) Carboxylates with Exceptionally High Cytotoxicity against Different Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Target-Based Anticancer Indole Derivatives for the Development of Anti-Glioblastoma Agents.', 'An esterase-responsive ibuprofen nano-micelle pre-modified embryo derived nucleus pulposus progenitor cells promote the regeneration of intervertebral disc degeneration.', 'Nanomedicine and versatile therapies for cancer treatment.', 'Polymeric Nanosystems Applied for Metal-Based Drugs and Photosensitizers Delivery: The State of the Art and Recent Advancements.']"""

The distribution of the passively targeted MSNs was related to the degree of vascularization of the tumors and did not follow the trends observed in vitro. Correlative analyses of organ-to-blood ratios revealed that little or no accumulation of the particles is observed in the lungs, heart, and brain, and that the particles detected were present in the blood pool. On the other hand, clear accumulation was observed in the liver and spleen, in addition to the uptake in the tumors.

The objective of this study was to analyze the factors contributing to uncertainty in SPR estimation using the DECT-based approach and to derive a comprehensive estimate of the range uncertainty associated with SPR estimation in treatment planning. Two state-of-the-art DECT-based methods were selected and implemented on a Siemens SOMATOM Force DECT scanner. The uncertainties were first divided into five independent categories. The uncertainty associated with each category was estimated for lung, soft and bone tissues separately. A single composite uncertainty estimate was eventually determined for three tumor sites (lung, prostate and head-and-neck) by weighting the relative proportion of each tissue group for that specific site. The uncertainties associated with the two selected DECT methods were found to be similar, therefore the following results applied to both methods. The overall uncertainty (1σ) in SPR estimation with the DECT-based approach was estimated to be 3.8%, 1.2% and 2.0% for lung, soft and bone tissues, respectively. The dominant factor contributing to uncertainty in the DECT approach was the imaging uncertainties, followed by the DECT modeling uncertainties.

However, the functional role and underlying mechanisms of miR‑30c in PCa remain to be fully elucidated. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis were used to detect the expression levels of alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2 (ASF/SF2) in PCa tissues. A luciferase reporter assay was used to investigate whether ASF/SF2 may be a direct target gene of miR‑30c. In addition, the effects of miR‑30c on the proliferation and apoptosis of PCa cell lines were examined, following transfection with miR‑30c mimics. Furthermore, correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between the expression of miR‑30c and ASF/SF2 and various clinicopathological parameters of patients with PCa. The present results demonstrated that PCa tissues exhibited higher levels of alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2 (ASF/SF2), compared with normal tissues. In addition, miR‑30c was revealed to targete the 3'‑untranslated region of the ASF/SF2 gene, causing a decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of ASF/SF2. Furthermore, miR‑30c was reported to decrease cell proliferation, increase the percentage of cells in the G1 cell cycle phase, and promote apoptosis through the inhibition of ASF/SF2. Following correlation analysis using patient samples, the expression of ASF/SF2 was revealed to be tightly correlated with the pathological stage of PCa and biochemical recurrence (BCR). In addition, patients with PCa exhibiting low expression levels of miR‑30c and high expression of ASF/SF2 had significantly lower rates of BCR‑free survival. In conclusion, the present study suggested that the tumor suppressor miR‑30c may be involved in PCa tumorigenesis, possibly via targeting ASF/SF2. The combined analysis of the expression of ASF/SF2 and miR‑30c may be a valuable tool for early prediction of BCR in patients with PCa following radical prostatectomy.""","""['Ya-Qiang Huang', 'Xiao-Hui Ling', 'Run-Qiang Yuan', 'Zhi-Yun Chen', 'Sheng-Bang Yang', 'Hong-Xing Huang', 'Wei-De Zhong', 'Shao-Peng Qiu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['E2F7, regulated by miR‑30c, inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell cycle of prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of ASF/SF2 as a critical, allele-specific effector of the cyclin D1b oncogene.', 'MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated interaction between leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF) and alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2 (ASF/SF2) affects mouse embryonic fibroblast senescence and apoptosis.', 'The gene encoding the splicing factor SF2/ASF is a proto-oncogene.', ""MicroRNA as new tools for prostate cancer risk assessment and therapeutic intervention: results from clinical data set and patients' samples."", 'The interplay between non-coding RNAs and alternative splicing: from regulatory mechanism to therapeutic implications in cancer.', 'SRSF1 acts as an IFN-I-regulated cellular dependency factor decisively affecting HIV-1 post-integration steps.', 'Lidocaine represses proliferation and cisplatin resistance in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma via miR-30c/SIRT1 regulation.', 'Alternative Splicing, Epigenetic Modifications and Cancer: A Dangerous Triangle, or a Hopeful One?', 'Identification of microRNA hsa-miR-30c-5p as an inhibitory factor in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and investigation of its regulatory network via comprehensive analysis.']"""

In this study we determined the radiation response following depletion or inhibition of TOPK, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase family Ser/Thr protein kinase that is upregulated in many cancers.  Methods:   Radiation response was studied in a wide range of cancer cell lines and normal cells using colony formation assays. The effect on cell cycle progression was assessed and the relationship between TOPK expression and therapeutic efficacy was studied in a cohort of 128 prostate cancer patients treated with radical radiotherapy.  Results:   TOPK knockdown did not alter radiation response in normal tissues, but significantly enhanced radiosensitivity in cancer cells. This result was recapitulated in TOPK knockout cells and with the TOPK inhibitor, OTS964. TOPK depletion altered the G1/S transition and G2/M arrest in response to radiation. Furthermore, TOPK depletion increased chromosomal aberrations, multinucleation and apoptotic cell death after irradiation. These results suggest a possible role for TOPK in the radiation-induced DNA damage checkpoints. These findings have clinical relevance, as elevated TOPK protein expression was associated with poorer clinical outcomes in prostate cancer patients treated with radical radiotherapy.

Additionally, cytotoxicity of soft coral crude extracts was assessed against androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines (PC3) and androgen-independent colon cancer cell lines (HT-29), with IC50 values ranging from 10-60 µg/mL. No obvious correlation between the extracts' IC50 values and their diterpene levels was found using either Spearman or Pearson correlations.

Such statistical practices may lead to incorrect conclusions about treatment effects or clinical trial designs that are impractical or that do not accurately reflect the investigator's goals. Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models and methods are a very flexible new class of statistical tools that can overcome such limitations. This is because BNP models can accurately approximate any distribution or function and can accommodate a broad range of statistical problems, including density estimation, regression, survival analysis, graphical modeling, neural networks, classification, clustering, population models, forecasting and prediction, spatiotemporal models, and causal inference. This paper describes 3 illustrative applications of BNP methods, including a randomized clinical trial to compare treatments for intraoperative air leaks after pulmonary resection, estimating survival time with different multi-stage chemotherapy regimes for acute leukemia, and evaluating joint effects of targeted treatment and an intermediate biological outcome on progression-free survival time in prostate cancer.""","""['Peter F Thall', 'Peter Mueller', 'Yanxun Xu', 'Michele Guindani']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pharm Stat""","""['Bayesian monitoring of clinical trials with failure-time endpoints.', 'A nonparametric Bayesian basket trial design.', 'Biomarker-based Bayesian randomized phase II clinical trial design to identify a sensitive patient subpopulation.', 'A Bayesian nonparametric meta-analysis model.', 'Therapeutic studies.', 'Utility-based Bayesian personalized treatment selection for advanced breast cancer.', 'A Causal Framework for Making Individualized Treatment Decisions in Oncology.', 'Hydra: A mixture modeling framework for subtyping pediatric cancer cohorts using multimodal gene expression signatures.']"""

Methods:   We prospectively collected results of the self-administered International Index Erectile Function Questionnaire 1-5 and 15 (IIEF 1-5 and 15) of 532 consecutive patients who underwent RALP for prostate cancer in our institution between October 2007 and December 2015. Patients were divided into two groups according to Floseal® application after prostatectomy. They were enrolled according to the following criteria: (a) bilateral nerve-sparing procedure; (b) preoperative IIEF ≥ 17; adherence to our erectile rehabilitation protocol; (c) 1-year follow-up. Outcomes were measured as mean IIEF score, EFR (IIEF < 17 or ≥17), grade of ED: severe (IIEF < 17), moderate (17-21), mild (22-25) and no ED (>25).  Results:   A total of 120 patients were enrolled. Group A included 40 consecutive patients who received traditional hemostasis, and Group B included 80 consecutive patients in which Floseal® was additionally used.

As with all imaging modalities, MRI reveals incidental findings (IFs) which carry the risk of increased cost, patient anxiety, and iatrogenic morbidity due to workup of IFs. Herein, we report the IFs from 684 MRIs for evaluation of PCa and consider their characteristics and clinical significance.  Methods:   Patients underwent mp-MRI prostate protocol incorporating triplanar T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced pelvic MRI as well as a post-contrast abdominopelvic MRI with the primary indication of detection or evaluation of PCa. A total of 684 consecutive prostate MRI reports performed in a series of 580 patients were reviewed. All extraprostatic findings reported were logged and then categorized by organ system and potential clinical significance.  Results:   There were 349 true IFs found in 233 (40%) of the 580 patients. One hundred nineteen additional extraprostatic findings were unsuspected but directly related to PCa staging, while the 349 IFs were unrelated and thus truly incidental beyond study indication. While the majority of true IFs were non-urologic, only 6.6% of IFs were considered clinically significant, non-urologic findings, and more than a third of MRI reports had urologic IFs not related to PCa.  Conclusions:   Rates of incidental findings on prostate indication MRI are similar to other abdominopelvic imaging studies. However, only 6.6% of the IFs were considered to be clinically significant non-urologic findings. Further investigations are needed to assess downstream workup of these IFs and resulting costs.""","""['Rachael L Sherrer', 'Win Shun Lai', 'John V Thomas', 'Jeffrey W Nix', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Prevalence and clinical significance of incidental findings on multiparametric prostate MRI.', 'The Relationship between PI-RADS Categories and Incidental Findings in Multiparametric Prostate MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of biparametric MRI to full multiparametric MRI for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric prostate MRI: focus on T2-weighted imaging and role in staging of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of the frequency of incidental findings and their clinical significance in multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging examination.', 'Incidental findings in and around the prostate on prostate MRI: a pictorial review.', 'Prevalence and clinical significance of incidental findings on multiparametric prostate MRI.', 'Increasing Utilization of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance.', 'Incidental bladder cancers found on multiparametric MRI of the prostate gland: a single center experience.']"""

We found that cytotoxicity of salinomycin to PC-3 cells was stronger than to nonmalignant prostate cell RWPE-1, and exposure to salinomycin induced G2/M phage arrest and apoptosis of PC-3 cells. A mechanistic study found salinomycin suppressed Wnt/β-catenin pathway to induce apoptosis of PC-3 cells. An in vivo experiment confirmed that salinomycin suppressed tumorigenesis in a NOD/SCID mice xenograft model generated from implanted PC-3 cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, since the total β-catenin protein level was reduced and the downstream target c-Myc level was significantly downregulated. We also showed that salinomycin, but not paclitaxel, triggered more apoptosis in aldehyde dehydrogenase- (ALDH-) positive PC-3 cells, which were considered as the prostate cancer stem cells, suggesting that salinomycin may be a promising chemotherapeutic to target CSCs.

Recently, neuropeptides have been recognized for their ability to act as potent cellular growth factors on many cell types, including cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism for how this occurs is unknown. To clarify the relationship between neuropeptides and cancer, we manually curated a total of 127 human neuropeptide genes by integrating information from the literature, homologous sequences, and database searches. Using human ligand-receptor interaction data, we first identified an interactome of 226 interaction pairs between 93 neuropeptides and 133 G-protein coupled receptors. We further identified four neuropeptide-receptor functional modules with ten or more genes, all of which were highly mutated in multiple cancers. We have identified a number of neuropeptide signaling systems with both oncogenic and tumour-suppressing roles for cancer progression, such as the insulin-like growth factors. By focusing on the neuroendocrine prostate cancer mutational data, we found prevalent amplification of neuropeptide and receptors in about 72% of samples. In summary, we report the first observation of abundant copy number variations on neuropeptides and receptors, which will be valuable for the design of peptide-based cancer prognosis, diagnosis and treatment.""","""['Min Zhao', 'Tianfang Wang', 'Qi Liu', 'Scott Cummins']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Repertoires of G protein-coupled receptors for Ciona-specific neuropeptides.', 'Neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors: drug targets, and peptide and non-peptide ligands: a tribute to Prof. Dieter Seebach.', 'Mini-review: the evolution of neuropeptide signaling.', 'Neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors in the Drosophila melanogaster genome.', 'Evolution of the AKH/corazonin/ACP/GnRH receptor superfamily and their ligands in the Protostomia.', 'Neurokinin-1 receptor drives PKCɑ-AURKA/N-Myc signaling to facilitate the neuroendocrine progression of prostate cancer.', 'Peptidergic Systems and Cancer: Focus on Tachykinin and Calcitonin/Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Families.', 'The Galaninergic System: A Target for Cancer Treatment.', 'Current Insights Into the Role of Neuropeptide Y in Skin Physiology and Pathology.', 'Decode the Stable Cell Communications Based on Neuropeptide-Receptors Network in 36746 Tumor Cells.']"""

Fifty-three men treated with docetaxel for mCRPC were tested for somatic BRCA1/2 mutations of the primary tumor. In a subgroup of patients, BRCA1/2 protein expression was tested as a potential surrogate marker for BRCA1/2 inactivation. Eight of 53 patients (15.1%) harbored a deleterious BRCA2 mutation. No BRCA1 mutation was found. Patients with a BRCA2 mutation showed a response rate of 25% to docetaxel in comparison to 71.1% in men with wildtype BRCA2 (p = 0.019). While the time to develop castration resistance was similar in both subgroups, the overall survival was significantly shorter in patients harboring a BRCA2 mutation. No correlation between the BRCA1/2 protein expression and the response to docetaxel was found. While the presence of a BRCA2 mutation does not preclude a response to docetaxel, there is overall a significant correlation between BRCA2 inactivation and a poor response rate.

The multifunctional cellular responses evoked by TGF-β are mediated by the canonical SMAD pathway and by noncanonical pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. We found that TGF-β activated PI3K in a manner dependent on the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 polyubiquitylated the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α and promoted the formation of a complex between the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and p85α, which led to the activation of PI3K and AKT. Lys63-linked polyubiquitylation of p85α on Lys513 and Lys519 in the iSH2 (inter-Src homology 2) domain was required for TGF-β-induced activation of PI3K-AKT signaling and cell motility in prostate cancer cells and activated macrophages. Unlike the activation of SMAD pathways, the TRAF6-mediated activation of PI3K and AKT was not dependent on the kinase activity of TβRI. In situ proximity ligation assays revealed that polyubiquitylation of p85α was evident in aggressive prostate cancer tissues.

We aimed to investigate the prospective association between plasma metabolite concentrations and risk of prostate cancer overall, and by time to diagnosis and tumour characteristics, and risk of death from prostate cancer.  Methods:   In a case-control study nested in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, pre-diagnostic plasma concentrations of 122 metabolites (including acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, hexose and sphingolipids) were measured using targeted mass spectrometry (AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit) and compared between 1077 prostate cancer cases and 1077 matched controls. Risk of prostate cancer associated with metabolite concentrations was estimated by multi-variable conditional logistic regression, and multiple testing was accounted for by using a false discovery rate controlling procedure.  Results:   Seven metabolite concentrations, i.e. acylcarnitine C18:1, amino acids citrulline and trans-4-hydroxyproline, glycerophospholipids PC aa C28:1, PC ae C30:0 and PC ae C30:2, and sphingolipid SM (OH) C14:1, were associated with prostate cancer (p < 0.05), but none of the associations were statistically significant after controlling for multiple testing. Citrulline was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio (OR1SD) = 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.86; p trend = 0.0002) in the first 5 years of follow-up after taking multiple testing into account, but not after longer follow-up; results for other metabolites did not vary by time to diagnosis. After controlling for multiple testing, 12 glycerophospholipids were inversely associated with advanced stage disease, with risk reduction up to 46% per standard deviation increase in concentration (OR1SD = 0.54; 95% CI 0.40-0.72; p trend = 0.00004 for PC aa C40:3). Death from prostate cancer was associated with higher concentrations of acylcarnitine C3, amino acids methionine and trans-4-hydroxyproline, biogenic amine ADMA, hexose and sphingolipid SM (OH) C14:1 and lower concentration of glycerophospholipid PC aa C42:4.  Conclusions:   Several metabolites, i.e. C18:1, citrulline, trans-4-hydroxyproline, three glycerophospholipids and SM (OH) C14:1, might be related to prostate cancer. Analyses by time to diagnosis indicated that citrulline may be a marker of subclinical prostate cancer, while other metabolites might be related to aetiology.

Here we show that osteoblasts release exosomes, we termed osteosomes, which may be a novel mechanism by which osteoblasts communicate with cells in their environment. We have isolated exosomes from undifferentiated/proliferating (D0 osteosomes) and differentiated/mineralizing (D24 osteosomes) primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts. The D0 and D24 osteosomes were found to be vesicles of 130-140 nm by dynamic light scattering analysis. Proteomics profiling using tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identified 206 proteins in D0 osteosomes and 336 in D24 osteosomes. The proteins in osteosomes are mainly derived from the cytoplasm (∼47%) and plasma membrane (∼31%). About 69% of proteins in osteosomes are also found in Vesiclepedia, and these canonical exosomal proteins include tetraspanins and Rab family proteins. We found that there are differences in both protein content and levels in exosomes isolated from undifferentiated and differentiated osteoblasts. Among the proteins that are unique to osteosomes, 169 proteins are present in both D0 and D24 osteosomes, 37 are unique to D0, and 167 are unique to D24. Among those 169 proteins present in both D0 and D24 osteosomes, 10 proteins are likely present at higher levels in D24 than D0 osteosomes based on emPAI ratios of >5. These results suggest that osteosomes released from different cellular state of osteoblasts may mediate distinct functions. Using live-cell imaging, we measured the uptake of PKH26-labeled osteosomes into C4-2B4 and PC3-mm2 prostate cancer cells. In addition, we showed that cadherin-11, a cell adhesion molecule, plays a role in the uptake of osteosomes into PC3-mm2 cells as osteosome uptake was delayed by neutralizing antibody against cadherin-11. Together, our studies suggest that osteosomes could have a unique role in the bone microenvironment under both physiological and pathological conditions.""","""['Mehmet Asim Bilen', 'Tianhong Pan', 'Yu-Chen Lee', 'Song-Chang Lin', 'Guoyu Yu', 'Jing Pan', 'David Hawke', 'Bih-Fang Pan', 'Jody Vykoukal', 'Kavanya Gray', 'Robert L Satcher', 'Gary E Gallick', 'Li-Yuan Yu-Lee', 'Sue-Hwa Lin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Proteome Res""","""['Proteomic signatures of extracellular vesicles secreted by nonmineralizing and mineralizing human osteoblasts and stimulation of tumor cell growth.', 'Osteoblast-Secreted Factors Mediate Dormancy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the Bone via Activation of the TGFβRIII-p38MAPK-pS249/T252RB Pathway.', 'Exosomal particles secreted by prostate cancer cells are potent mRNA and protein vehicles for the interference of tumor and tumor environment.', 'Contribution of proteomics to understanding the role of tumor-derived exosomes in cancer progression: state of the art and new perspectives.', 'Exosomes in Severe Asthma: Update in Their Roles and Potential in Therapy.', 'Extracellular vesicles: From bone development to regenerative orthopedics.', 'Deciphering core proteins of osteoporosis with iron accumulation by proteomics in human bone.', 'Long-term osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells in simulated microgravity: novel proteins sighted.', 'Identification of proteins in housefly (Musca domestica) larvae powder by LC-MS/MS and their potential medical relevance.', 'Bone Cell Exosomes and Emerging Strategies in Bone Engineering.']"""

Consequently, patients with severe Hymenoptera venom allergy and cancer require specific care. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy and cancer undergoing venom immunotherapy (VIT).  Methods:   The study population comprised all patients referred for evaluation of Hymenoptera venom allergy or for a routine check-up during VIT from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008.  Results:   Of the patients assessed, 2% (51 of 2594) had a documented Hymenoptera venom allergy and cancer (25 female, 26 male; mean age 58 years). Of these, 42 patients received VIT (82%): 25 patients had a previously diagnosed malignancy, 16 were diagnosed with malignancy during VIT, and 1 patient was diagnosed with cancer after completion of VIT. The most frequent type of tumor was breast cancer in female patients (60%) and prostate cancer in male patients (39%). Systemic allergic reactions during VIT were recorded in 7% of patients. A total of 19 patients experienced a field sting or underwent a sting challenge test during VIT: 95% tolerated the sting well. VIT was halted definitively in 9 patients (new diagnosis of cancer in 7 patients, reactivation of cancer in 1, and progressive polyneuropathy in 1).  Conclusions:   The effectiveness and adverse effects of VIT in patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy and cancer in remission are comparable to those of patients without malignancy.

Here we performed a SNP and gene-based association analysis of the RTK/ERK pathway with aggressive prostate cancer in a cohort comprising 956 aggressive and 347 non-aggressive cases. We identified several loci including rs3217869/CCND2 within the pathway shown to be significantly associated with aggressive prostate cancer. Our functional analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship between rs3217869 risk genotype and decreased CCND2 expression levels in a collection of 119 prostate cancer patient samples. Reduced expression of CCND2 promoted cell proliferation and its overexpression inhibited cell growth of prostate cancer. Strikingly, CCND2 downregulation was consistently observed in the advanced prostate cancer in 18 available clinical data sets with a total amount of 1,095 prostate samples. Furthermore, the lower expression levels of CCND2 markedly correlated with prostate tumor progression to high Gleason score and elevated PSA levels, and served as an independent predictor of biochemical relapse and overall survival in a large cohort of prostate cancer patients.

Elevated toxicity associated with combination immunotherapy, however, prevents translation of the most efficacious regimens. We evaluated T-cell checkpoint-modulating antibodies targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, and 4-1BB together with myeloid agonists targeting either STING or Flt3 in the TRAMP-C2 model of prostate cancer to determine whether low-dose intratumoral delivery of these agents could elicit systemic control of multifocal disease. Intratumoral administration of the STING agonist cyclic di-GMP (CDG) or Flt3 Ligand (Flt3L) augmented the therapeutic effect of systemic triple checkpoint modulation and promoted the cure of 75% of mice with bilateral TRAMP-C2; however, when all agents were administered locally, only CDG mobilized abscopal immunity. Combination efficacy correlated with globally enhanced ratios of CD8+ T cells to regulatory T cells (Treg), macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and downregulation of the M2 marker CD206 on tumor-associated macrophages. Flt3L improved CD8+ T-cell and dendritic cell infiltration of tumors, but was diminished in efficacy by concomitant Treg expansion. Although intratumoral CDG/checkpoint therapy invokes substantial ulceration at the injection site, reduced CDG dosing can preserve tissue integrity without sacrificing therapeutic benefit. For high-order combinations of T-cell checkpoint antibodies and local myeloid agonists, systemic antibody administration provides the greatest efficacy; however, local administration of CDG and antibody provides substantial systemic benefit while minimizing the potential for immune-related adverse events.

We sought to evaluate national trends and identify factors associated with HFxn utilization using the US National Cancer Database.  Methods and materials:   We queried the National Cancer Database for men diagnosed with localized (N0,M0) PCa from 2004 through 2013 treated with external beam radiation therapy. Patients were grouped by dose per fraction (DpF) in Gray: CFxn was defined as DpF ≤2.0, moderate HFxn as DpF >2.0 but <5.0, and extreme HFxn as DpF ≥5.0. Men receiving DpF <1.5 or >15.0 were excluded, as were those receiving <25 or >90 Gy total dose. Multiple logistic regression was performed to identify demographic, clinical, and treatment factor associations.  Results:   A total of 132,403 men were identified, with 120,055 receiving CFxn, 7264 moderate HFxn, and 5084 extreme HFxn. Although CFxn was by far the most common approach over the analysis period, HFxn use increased from 6.2% in 2004 to 14.2% in 2013 (P < .01). Extreme HFxn use increased the most (from 0.3% to 8.5%), whereas moderate HFxn utilization was unchanged (from 5.9% to 5.7%). HFxn use was independently associated with younger age, later year of diagnosis, non-black race, non-Medicaid insurance, non-Western residence, higher income, academic treatment facility, greater distance from treatment facility, low-risk disease group (by National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria), and nonreceipt of hormone therapy.  Conclusions:   Although CFxn remains the most common radiation therapy schedule for localized PCa, use of HFxn appears to be increasing in the United States as a result of increased extreme HFxn use. Financial and logistical factors may accelerate adoption of shorter schedules. Considering the multiple demographic and prognostic differences identified between these groups, randomized outcome data comparing extreme HFxn to alternatives are desirable.""","""['William A Stokes', 'Brian D Kavanagh', 'David Raben', 'Thomas J Pugh']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Peering over the chasm: Diffusion of prostate radiation therapy hypofractionation.', 'Patterns of Fractionation and Boost Usage in Adjuvant External Beam Radiotherapy for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ in the United States.', 'Patterns of Care for Patients With Early-Stage Glottic Cancer Undergoing Definitive Radiation Therapy: A National Cancer Database Analysis.', 'Patient characterization and usage trends of proton beam therapy for localized prostate cancer in the United States: A study of the National Cancer Database.', 'Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Challenging Accelerated Hypofractionated Radiotherapy.', 'Systematic review of hypofractionated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Patterns of utilization and clinical adoption of 0.35 Tesla MR-guided radiation therapy in the United States - Understanding the transition to adaptive, ultra-hypofractionated treatments.', 'Impact of Race on Outcomes of High-Risk Patients With Prostate Cancer Treated With Moderately Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in an Equal Access Setting.', 'Clinical adoption patterns of 0.35 Tesla MR-guided radiation therapy in Europe and Asia.', 'Bowel and Bladder Reproducibility in Image Guided Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Results of a Patterns of Practice Survey.', 'Evaluation of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Use and Patient-Reported Outcomes in Men With Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer in Australia and New Zealand.']"""

In this paper, we assess the differences in results produced by two permutations of cause-specific and relative survival applied to estimating cancer survival and disparities in cancer survival, using data from First Nations and non-Aboriginal populations in Canada.  Methods:   Subjects were members of the 1991 Canadian Census Mortality Cohort, a population-based cohort of adult respondents to the 1991 Long Form Census who have been followed up for incident cancers and death through linkage to administrative databases. We compared four methods: relative survival analyses with ethnicity-specific life tables (RS-ELT); relative survival with general population life tables (RS-GLT); cause-specific survival with a broad definition of cancer death (CS-Broad); and cause-specific survival with a narrow definition of cause of death (CS-Narrow) and applied these to the nine most common cancers among First Nations.  Results:   Apart from breast and prostate cancers, RS-ELT, RS-GLT, and CS-Broad tended to produce similar estimates of age-standardized five-year survival, whereas CS-Narrow yielded higher estimates of survival. CS-Narrow estimates were particularly unlike those based on the other methods for cancers of the digestive and respiratory tracts. Estimates of disparities in survival were generally comparable across the four methods except for breast and prostate cancers.  Conclusions:   Cancer surveillance efforts in sub-populations defined by race, ethnicity, geography, socioeconomic status, or similar factors are necessary for identifying disparities and monitoring progress toward reducing them.

Distinguishing between aggressive and indolent cancer is an important clinical challenge. The current approaches for assessing tumor aggressiveness are recognized as insufficient. A validated protein-based assay has been shown to predict tumor aggressiveness from prostate biopsy. The main objective of this study was to measure the clinical utility of this new assay in the management of early-stage prostate cancer.  Methods:   One hundred twenty nine board-certified urologists were asked to participate in a randomized, two-arm experiment. We collected data over 2 rounds using simulated clinical cases administered via an online platform. The cases were all newly diagnosed Gleason 3 + 3 or 3 + 4 prostate camcer patients. Urologists in the intervention arm received a 15-min webinar on this protein-based assay and given assay test results for their simulated patients in round 2. Each case had a preferred recommendation of either active surveillance or active treatment. The measured outcome was rate of preferred recommendation, defined as urologists who recommended the proper treatment course. Analyses were done using difference-in-difference estimations.  Results:   Using multinomial logistical regression, urologists who were given the assay results were significantly more likely to choose the preferred recommendation (active surveillance or active treatment) compared to controls (p = 0.004). These urologists were also significantly more likely to involve their patients in the treatment decision compared to controls (p = 0.001).

Differences in the effects on organs and tissues are sometimes small and sometimes opposed, sometimes the isomers work synergistically. Diverse influence has been shown mainly in neoplastic processes and lipid metabolism. For example, differences in inhibition of proliferation of prostate cancer cells are explained by different pathways: t10,c12 CLA acts on apoptosis and cell cycle control genes, while c9,t11 CLA regulates genes involved in metabolism of arachidonic acid with subsequent impairment of eicosanoids synthesis.

The MNP chains are assembled in a rotating magnetic field and stabilized by multivalent target molecules. The number of chains remaining in zero field is proportional to the target concentration, and can be quantified by optomagnetic measurements. The shape anisotropy of the MNP chains enhances the biosensor system in terms of providing efficient mixing, reduction of depletion effects (via magnetic shape anisotropy), and directly increasing the optomagnetic signal (via optical shape anisotropy). We achieve a limit of detection (LOD) of 5.5pM (0.82ng/mL) for the detection of a model multivalent molecule, biotinylated anti-streptavidin, in PBS. For the measurements of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in 50% serum using the proposed method, we achieve an LOD of 21.6pM (0.65ng/mL) and a dynamic detection range up to 66.7nM (2µg/mL) with a sample-to-result time of approximately 20min. The performance for PSA detection therefore well meets the clinical requirements in terms of LOD (the threshold PSA level in blood is 4ng/mL) and detection range (PSA levels span from < 0.1-104ng/mL in blood), thus showing great promise for routine PSA diagnostics and for other in-situ applications.""","""['Bo Tian', 'Erik Wetterskog', 'Zhen Qiu', 'Teresa Zardán Gómez de la Torre', 'Marco Donolato', 'Mikkel Fougt Hansen', 'Peter Svedlindh', 'Mattias Strömberg']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['A novel SERS-based magnetic aptasensor for prostate specific antigen assay with high sensitivity.', 'Comparison of optomagnetic and AC susceptibility readouts in a magnetic nanoparticle agglutination assay for detection of C-reactive protein.', 'Blu-ray based optomagnetic aptasensor for detection of small molecules.', 'Optomagnetic biosensors: Volumetric sensing based on magnetic actuation-induced optical modulations.', 'Current advances and future visions on bioelectronic immunosensing for prostate-specific antigen.', 'Designable Poly(methacrylic Acid)/Silver Cluster Ring Arrays as Reflectance Spectroscopy-Based Biosensors for Label-Free Plague Diagnosis.', 'Active Opto-Magnetic Biosensing with Silicon Microring Resonators.', 'Nanotechnology-Based Strategies for Effective and Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2.']"""

Case report:   A 67-year-old man was referred because of progressive and painless decrease vision in the left eye. He had been treated with 7 cycles of zoledronic acid infusions because of metastatic prostate cancer. On examination, VA was 20/20 in the right eye (OD) and 20/50 in the left eye (OS). The optic nerve was unremarkable OU. Pattern visual evoked potentials (pVEP) and electroretinography were performed with the result of VEP responses abolished in OS, and the VEP waveform within the normal range amplitude and delayed peak latencies in OD. Due to the high suspicion of bilateral RON secondary to zoledronic acid, we decided to discontinue the treatment. Two months later, VA was 20/20 OD and hand motions OS, with relative afferent pupillary defect and a pallor of the optic disc in OS. The diagnosis of bilateral RON secondary to zoledronic acid infusions was confirmed, and it was only partially reversible.  Discussion:   Zoledronic acid is a potent new generation bisphosphonate increasingly used in oncologic patients and it is usually well tolerated. Optic nerve toxicity is not a side effect recognised by either the Food and Drug Administration or the drug manufacturers, and to our knowledge, this is the first case of zoledronic acid-related bilateral RON with late onset.

Objective:   To compare overall survival (OS) for men with unfavorable PCa between LDR-B and DE-EBRT groups.  Design, setting, and participants:   Using the National Cancer Data Base, we identified men with unfavorable PCa treated between 2004 and 2012 with androgen suppression (AS) and either EBRT followed by LDR-B or DE-EBRT (75.6-86.4Gy).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Treatment selection was evaluated using logistic regression and annual percentage proportions. OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards, and propensity score matching.  Results and limitation:   We identified 25038 men between 2004 and 2012, during which LDR-B boost utilization decreased from 29% to 14%. LDR-B was associated with better OS on univariate (7-yr OS: 82% vs 73%; p<0.001) and multivariate analyses (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.77). Propensity score matching verified an OS benefit associated with LDR-B boost (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66-0.89). The OS benefit of LDR-B boost persisted when limited to men aged <60 yr with no comorbidities. On subset analysis, there was no interaction between treatment and age, risk group, or radiation dose. Limitations include the retrospective design, nonrandomized selection bias, and the absence of treatment toxicity, hormone duration, and cancer-specific outcomes.  Conclusions:   Between 2004 and 2012, LDR-B boost utilization declined and was associated with better OS compared to DE-EBRT alone. LDR-B boost is probably the ideal treatment option for men with unfavorable PCa, pending long-term results of randomized trials.  Patient summary:   We compared radiotherapy utilization and survival for prostate cancer (PCa) patients using a national database. We found that low-dose rate brachytherapy (LDR-B) boost, a method being used less frequently, was associated with better overall survival when compared to dose-escalated external-beam radiotherapy alone for men with unfavorable PCa. Randomized trials are needed to confirm that LDR-B boost is the ideal treatment.""","""['Skyler B Johnson', 'Nataniel H Lester-Coll', 'Jacqueline R Kelly', 'Benjamin H Kann', 'James B Yu', 'Sameer K Nath']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Optimal Radiotherapy for Unfavorable-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Suppression Combined with Elective Nodal and Dose Escalated Radiation Therapy (the ASCENDE-RT Trial): An Analysis of Survival Endpoints for a Randomized Trial Comparing a\xa0Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Boost to a\xa0Dose-Escalated External Beam Boost for High- and Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'A comparative analysis of overall survival between high-dose-rate and low-dose-rate brachytherapy boosts for unfavorable-risk prostate cancer.', 'Brachytherapy improves biochemical failure-free survival in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer compared with conventionally fractionated external beam radiation therapy: a propensity score matched analysis.', 'Permanent interstitial low-dose-rate brachytherapy for patients with localised prostate cancer: a systematic review of randomised and nonrandomised controlled clinical trials.', 'A Brief Review of Low-Dose Rate (LDR) and High-Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy Boost for High-Risk Prostate.', 'Comparison of outcomes in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with low-/high-dose-rate brachytherapy plus external beam radiotherapy.', 'Real-world utilisation of brachytherapy boost and patient-reported functional outcomes in men who had external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer in Australia.', 'Patient reported outcomes for quality of life (QOL) by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) on average 15 years post treatment.', 'Assessing the impact of brachytherapy boost and androgen deprivation therapy on survival outcomes for patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy.', 'Radioactive Iodine-125 in Tumor Therapy: Advances and Future Directions.']"""

Methods:   MC models of the Autoscan US probe were developed using the BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc code based on kV and MV CT images. CT datasets were converted to voxelized mass density phantoms using a CT number-to-mass density calibration. The dosimetric effect of the probe, in the contact region (an 8 mm × 12 mm single layer of voxels), was investigated using a phantom set-up mimicking two scenarios (a) a transperineal imaging configuration (radiation beam perpendicular to the central US axial direction), and (b) a transabdominal imaging configuration (radiation beam parallel to the central US axial direction). For scenario (a), the dosimetric effect was evaluated as a function of the probe to inferior radiation field edge distance. Clinically applicable distances from 5 mm separation to 2 mm overlap were determined from the radiotherapy plans of 27 patients receiving Clarity imaging. Overlaps of 3 to 14 (1 to 3 SD) mm were also considered to include the effect of interfraction motion correction. The influence of voxel size on surface dose estimation was investigated. Approved clinical plans from two prostate patients were used to simulate worst-case dosimetric impact of the probe when large couch translations were applied to correct for interfraction prostate motion.  Results:   The dosimetric impact of both the MV and kV probe models agreed within ±2% for both beam configurations. For scenario (a) and 1 mm voxel model, the probe gave mean dose increases of 1.2% to 4.6% (of the dose at isocenter) for 5 mm separation to 0 mm overlap in the probe-phantom contact region, respectively. This increased to 27.5% for the largest interfraction motion correction considered (14 mm overlap). For separations of ≥ 2 mm dose differences were < 2%. Simulated dose perturbations were found to be superficial; for the 14 mm overlap the dose increase reduced to < 3% at 5.0 mm within the phantom. For scenario (b), dose increases due to the probe were < 5% in all cases. The dose increase was underestimated by up to ~13% when the voxel size was increased from 1 mm to 3 mm. MC simulated dose to the PTV and OARs for the two clinical plans considered showed good agreement with commercial treatment planning system results (within 2%). Mean dose increases due to the presence of the probe, after the maximum interfraction motion correction, were ~16.3% and ~8.0%, in the contact region, for plan 1 and plan 2, respectively.  Conclusions:   The presence of the probe results in superficial dose perturbations for patients with an overlap between the probe and the radiation field present in either the original treatment plan or due to translation of the radiation field to simulate correction of interfraction internal prostate motion.""","""['Michael Martyn', ""Tuathan P O'Shea"", 'Emma Harris', 'Jeffrey Bamber', 'Stephen Gilroy', 'Mark J Foley']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Assessment of Monte Carlo algorithm for compliance with RTOG 0915 dosimetric criteria in peripheral lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Impact of intrafraction and residual interfraction effect on prostate proton pencil beam scanning.', 'Experimental measurements and Monte Carlo simulations for dosimetric evaluations of intrafraction motion for gated and ungated intensity modulated arc therapy deliveries.', 'Organ motion and its management.', 'Review of ultrasound image guidance in external beam radiotherapy: I.

Initial PSA, prostate weight, and body mass index (BMI) were 4.4 ng/ml, 45 g, and 25, respectively. Instruments and camera cross within the Single-Site port; the da Vinci System software detects and reassigns the user's hands with the instruments position. The single-site port is inserted through a 2-cm intraumbilical incision. The robotic 8.5 mm scope and two surgical curved instruments (fenestrated bipolar forceps and cautery hook) are introduced through the ports and used for most of the procedure, whereas a wristed needle driver on the right hand is used for the reconstructive steps. An additional 12 mm port (Air Seal, SurgiQuest) is placed in a midline between the umbilicus and the right iliac spine in order to facilitate table assistance during surgery and to place a drain at the end of the procedure.Operative time and blood loss were 300 min and 400 mL, respectively.

Materials and methods:   Three-Tesla MR images of 50 patients with 55 cancer-suspicious lesions were prospectively evaluated. Findings were correlated with histopathology after MRI-guided biopsy. T2 RevPROP, T2 TSE, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast enhancement, and MR-spectroscopy were acquired. RevPROP was compared to TSE concerning PI-RADS scores, lesion size, lesion signal-intensity, lesion contrast, artefacts, and image quality.  Results:   There were 41 carcinomas in 55 cancer-suspicious lesions. RevPROP detected 41 of 41 carcinomas (100%) and 54 of 55 lesions (98.2%). TSE detected 39 of 41 carcinomas (95.1%) and 51 of 55 lesions (92.7%). RevPROP showed fewer artefacts and higher image quality (each p < 0.001). No differences were observed between single and overall PI-RADS scores based on RevPROP or TSE (p = 0.106 and p = 0.107). Lesion size was not different (p = 0.105).

Methods:   One hundred and three consecutive patients (65 ± 10 years) were included in this trial, powered to demonstrate an improvement of image quality after HBB administration, assessed on a 5-point scale by two blinded readers. All patients received high-spatial resolution axial T2-weighted TSE sequences at 3.0 T without spasmolytic agent, repeated after application of 40 mg HBB and followed by routine mp-MRI. Secondary endpoints were (1) susceptibility to side effects, (2) dependence of spasmolytic effect on patients´ weight, and (3) prostate volume.  Results:   In 68% of patients, HBB significantly improved the anatomic score (mean 3.4 ± 0.9 before and 4.4 ± 0.7 after HBB for both readers, p = <0.001). In 67%, HBB significantly enhanced the artefact score (mean 3.2 ± 1 before and 4.2 ± 0.8 after HBB for reader 1, p = <0.001; 3.2 ± 1 and 4.1 ± 0.8 for reader 2, p = <0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between patients with different bodyweight or prostate volume. Inter-reader agreement was excellent (k = 0.95-0.98).  Conclusions:   Hyoscine butylbromide significantly improves image quality and reduces motion-related artefacts in mp-MRI of the prostate independent of bodyweight or prostate volume. No side effects were reported.  Key points:   • Hyoscine butylbromide (HBB) improved image quality in over 2/3 of patients. • Severe artefacts were reduced after HBB in more than 20%. • The number of non-diagnostic MRI was reduced to <1% after HBB. • HBB effect was independent of bodyweight and prostate volume. • No side effects of HBB were reported in this study population.""","""['T Ullrich', 'M Quentin', 'A K Schmaltz', 'C Arsov', 'C Rubbert', 'D Blondin', 'R Rabenalt', 'P Albers', 'G Antoch', 'L Schimmöller']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Effect of hyoscine butylbromide on prostate multiparametric MRI anatomical and functional image quality.', 'The value of hyoscine butylbromide in pelvic MRI.', 'The value of hyoscine butylbromide in abdominal MR imaging with and without oral magnetic particles.', 'Hyoscine butylbromide - a review on its parenteral use in acute abdominal spasm and as an aid in abdominal diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.', ""Do antispasmodics or rectal enemas improve image quality on multiparametric prostate MRI?

Methods and materials:   In 1997, the BC Cancer Agency adopted as standard a policy of prolonged ADT (>18months) with EBRT for locally advanced PCa. Two cohorts of cT3-T4 PCa treated with EBRT were selected: 1993-1995 (early: N=725) and 1999-2001 (late: N=584). Duration of ADT and baseline prognostic factors (age, clinical stage, grade, presenting PSA, and Charlson index (CCI)) were abstracted from charts. Estimates of 10-year (E10) survival using an age-adjusted CCI were calculated and patients were grouped into low (<60%), medium (60-90%) and high (>90%) E10. In each E10 group, actual overall survivals were compared by era using log rank test.  Results:   There were 318 low, 544 medium, and 447 high E10 patients with median follow-up of 11.1years. Gleason grade and T stage were not statistically different between E10 groups. As expected, median age and baseline CCI were higher in lower E10 groups (p<0.0001). Overall survival was higher in the late era, but varied with E10 group: low (43% vs. 49%, p=0.54), medium (55% vs. 64%, p=0.02) and high (66% vs. 77%, p=0.01).  Conclusion:   The policy of prolonged ADT with EBRT provides a survival benefit that varies with baseline risk of death from other causes.

The aims were to analyse the dose plans in terms of dosimetric quality and deliverability, and to validate whether in-house pre-treatment verification results agreed with those of an external audit.  Materials and methods:   The nine participating centres encompassed different machines, equipment, and methodologies. Two mock cases (prostate and head and neck) were planned using one and two arcs. A plan quality index was defined to compare the plans and different complexity indices were calculated to check their deliverability. We compared gamma index pass rates using the centre's equipment and methodology to those of an external audit (global 3D gamma, absolute dose differences, 10% of maximum dose threshold). Log-file analysis was performed to look for delivery errors.  Results:   All centres fulfilled the dosimetric goals but plan quality and delivery complexity were heterogeneous and uncorrelated, depending on the manufacturer and the planner's methodology. Pre-treatment verifications results were within tolerance in all cases for gamma 3%-3mm evaluation. Nevertheless, differences between the external audit and in-house measurements arose due to different equipment or methodology, especially for 2%-2mm criteria with differences up to 20%. No correlation was found between complexity indices and verification results amongst centres.  Conclusions:   All plans fulfilled dosimetric constraints, but plan quality and complexity did not correlate and were strongly dependent on the planner and the vendor.

Methods:   The present study included a total of 302 consecutive Japanese patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. In this study, postoperative urinary continence was defined as no leak or the use of a security pad. The continence status was assessed by interviews before and 1 and 3 months after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

Despite the operative time being longer in patients with metabolic syndrome, no significant differences were observed in the remaining preoperative, intraoperative or postoperative variables between patients with or without metabolic syndrome. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, metabolic syndrome and the duration of hospitalization were significantly correlated with the 1-month continence status. Similarly, metabolic syndrome and estimated blood loss during surgery were independent predictors of continence rates at 3 months after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of stigmatization on depressive symptomatology and whether body image mediates this relationship.  Methods:   This bicentric study assessed patients of 4 major tumor entities. We measured stigmatization (SIS-D), depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9), and body image (FKB-20). Applying multiple mediator analyses, we calculated the total effect of stigmatization on depressive symptomatology and the indirect effects exerted via the 2 body image scales rejecting body evaluation and vital body dynamics.  Results:   Among the 858 cancer patients recruited (breast: n = 297; prostate: n = 268; colorectal: n = 168; lung: n = 125), stigmatization showed total effects on depressive symptomatology across all stigma dimensions (all ptotal sample < .001). Except for lung cancer patients, this result was replicated for each cancer group. Body image as a whole was shown to mediate the effect across all samples (γtotal sample = .04, 95%-CI: 0.03-0.06). Among the total sample and prostate cancer patients, the mediating effect of rejecting body evaluation was significantly larger than the effect of vital body dynamics (dtotal sample = .02, 95%-CI: 0.01-0.04).  Conclusions:   Perceived stigmatization is an important and generalizable risk factor for depressive symptomatology among cancer patients.

However few studies have examined associations of thyroid hormones with cancer risk.  Objectives:   To explore associations of thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb) with the incidence of all (non-skin) cancers and specific common cancers.  Design and setting:   A prospective cohort study of a community-dwelling population aged 25-84 years in Western Australia.  Main outcome measures:   Archived sera from 3649 participants in the 1994/1995 Busselton Health Survey were assayed for TSH, FT4 and TPOAb. Cancer outcomes until 30 June 2014 were ascertained using data linkage. Longitudinal analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   During 20-year follow-up, 600 participants were diagnosed with non-skin cancer, including 126, 100, 103 and 41 prostate, breast, colorectal and lung cancers respectively. Higher TSH was associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer after adjusting for potential confounders, with a 30% lower risk for every 1 IU/L increase in TSH (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55-0.90, P = 0.005). Similarly, higher FT4 was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (adjusted HR: 1.11 per 1 pmol/L increase, 95% CI: 1.03-1.19, P = 0.009). There were no associations of TSH, FT4 or TPOAb with all non-skin cancer events combined, or with breast, colorectal or lung cancer.  Conclusion:   In a community-dwelling population, lower TSH and higher FT4 were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.

However, the mechanism by which CD147 modulates cell proliferation is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of CD147 in cell proliferation associated with the TGF-β/Smad4 signaling pathway. Here, we used cell viability and clone formation assays in LNCaP prostate cancer cells to demonstrate that CD147 promotes cell proliferation. The luciferase assay and western blotting show that silencing CD147 using shRNA enhances transcription and expression of p21WAF1. Using immunofluorescence and nuclear-cytoplasmic separation, we show that this is primarily attributed to transport of Smad4 from the cytoplasm to nucleus. Other assays (GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence) demonstrate that Smad4 is a new interaction partner of CD147, with the Smad4 MH2 domain and CD147 intracellular domain (CD147-ICD) being involved in the interaction. Furthermore, we report that a phosphoserine (pSer) in CD147 (pSer252) is responsible for this interaction and inhibition of the Smad4/p21WAF1 signal that promotes cell proliferation.

Current therapeutic practice considers Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) as first line treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer at high-risk, either locally advanced or metastatic. ADT can be achieved through orchiectomy (surgical castration), luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, or through complete androgen blockade (LHRH agonist combined with an anti-androgen). Docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone is indicated for the treatment of patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer. The CHAARTED and STAMPEDE clinical trials studied the effect of bringing forward the use of docetaxel added on to ADT in the context of hormone-sensitive patients. The CHAARTED clinical trial showed a significant increase in a variable with maximum relevance such as Overall Survival (OS), with a difference of 13.6 months between medians. There was also clinical benefit in the secondary variables: median time until castration-resistant disease or until clinical progression. In the STAMPEDE clinical trial, which included 39% of non-metastatic patients, a 10-month difference between medians was demonstrated in OS, and 17 months in the primary co-variable of Progression Free Survival. The most frequent adverse events were: neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leucopenia, and general disorders such as asthenia, lethargy or fever. According to data from the CHAARTED and STAMPEDE studies, and the incremental cost of € 3 196.98 for adding on docetaxel to standard treatment, the estimated additional cost for each year of life gained is compatible with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between € 2 267.36 and € 3 851.78.

In this paper, we present DoriTool, a comprehensive, easy, and friendly pipeline integrating biological data from different functional tools. The tool was designed with the aim to maximize reproducibility and reduce the working time of the researchers, especially of those with limited bioinformatics skills, and to help them with the interpretation of the results. DoriTool is based upon an integrative strategy implemented following a modular design pattern. Using scripts written in Bash, Perl and R, it performs a functional in silico analysis annotation at mutation/variant level, gene level, pathway level and network level by combining up-to-date functional and genomic data and integrating also third-party bioinformatics tools in a pipeline. DoriTool uses GRCh37 human assembly and online mode. DoriTool provides nice visual reports including variant annotation, linkage disequilibrium proxies, gene annotation, gene ontology analysis, expression quantitative trait loci results from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and coloured pathways. Here, we also show DoriTool functionalities by applying it to a dataset of 13 variants associated with prostate cancer. Project development, released code libraries, GitHub repository (https://github.com/doritool) and documentation are hosted at https://doritool.github.io/.

Uncertainty persists regarding nonfatal health outcomes and long-term mortality.  Methods:   From November 1994 through January 2002, we randomly assigned 731 men with localized prostate cancer to radical prostatectomy or observation. We extended follow-up through August 2014 for our primary outcome, all-cause mortality, and the main secondary outcome, prostate-cancer mortality. We describe disease progression, treatments received, and patient-reported outcomes through January 2010 (original follow-up).  Results:   During 19.5 years of follow-up (median, 12.7 years), death occurred in 223 of 364 men (61.3%) assigned to surgery and in 245 of 367 (66.8%) assigned to observation (absolute difference in risk, 5.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.5 to 12.4; hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.01; P=0.06). Death attributed to prostate cancer or treatment occurred in 27 men (7.4%) assigned to surgery and in 42 men (11.4%) assigned to observation (absolute difference in risk, 4.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.2 to 8.3; hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.02; P=0.06). Surgery may have been associated with lower all-cause mortality than observation among men with intermediate-risk disease (absolute difference, 14.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 25.6) but not among those with low-risk disease (absolute difference, 0.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -10.5 to 11.8) or high-risk disease (absolute difference, 2.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -11.5 to 16.1) (P=0.08 for interaction). Treatment for disease progression was less frequent with surgery than with observation (absolute difference, 26.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 19.0 to 32.9); treatment was primarily for asymptomatic, local, or biochemical (prostate-specific antigen) progression. Urinary incontinence and erectile and sexual dysfunction were each greater with surgery than with observation through 10 years. Disease-related or treatment-related limitations in activities of daily living were greater with surgery than with observation through 2 years.  Conclusions:   After nearly 20 years of follow-up among men with localized prostate cancer, surgery was not associated with significantly lower all-cause or prostate-cancer mortality than observation. Surgery was associated with a higher frequency of adverse events than observation but a lower frequency of treatment for disease progression, mostly for asymptomatic, local, or biochemical progression.

This study examined gene expression profiles of prostate tissue to identify biological processes differentially expressed by obesity status and lethal prostate cancer.  Methods:   Gene expression profiling was performed on tumor (n = 402) and adjacent normal (n = 200) prostate tissue from participants in 2 prospective cohorts who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1982 to 2005. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from the questionnaire immediately preceding cancer diagnosis. Men were followed for metastases or prostate cancer-specific death (lethal disease) through 2011. Gene Ontology biological processes differentially expressed by BMI were identified using gene set enrichment analysis. Pathway scores were computed by averaging the signal intensities of member genes. Odds ratios (ORs) for lethal prostate cancer were estimated with logistic regression.  Results:   Among 402 men, 48% were healthy weight, 31% were overweight, and 21% were very overweight/obese. Fifteen gene sets were enriched in tumor tissue, but not normal tissue, of very overweight/obese men versus healthy-weight men; 5 of these were related to chromatin modification and remodeling (false-discovery rate < 0.25). Patients with high tumor expression of chromatin-related genes had worse clinical characteristics (Gleason grade > 7, 41% vs 17%; P = 2 × 10-4 ) and an increased risk of lethal disease that was independent of grade and stage (OR, 5.26; 95% confidence interval, 2.37-12.25).

Agreement between systems for lateral, vertical, and longitudinal translations was excellent, with ρc values of greater than 0.98 between all three systems in all axes. There was excellent agreement between the systems for rotations around the lateral axis (pitch) (ρc > 0.99), and around the vertical axis (yaw) (ρc > 0.97). However, somewhat poorer agreement for rotations around the longitudinal axis (roll) was observed, with the lowest correlation observed between Calypso and kV orthogonal imaging (ρc = 0.895).

Methods:   Samples and data were retrospectively collected from seven institutions and centrally reviewed. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays to assess the expression of candidate proteins, based on the molecular classification of PCa, including ERG, PTEN, and SPINK1. SPOP mutations were investigated from tumor DNA by Sanger sequencing. Relationships with outcome were analyzed using log-rank analysis and multivariable Cox regression.  Results:   Among 56 reviewed prostatectomy specimens, 45 cases of DAC were finally confirmed. The pathological stage was pT3 in more than 66% of cases. ERG was expressed in 42% of DAC, SPINK1 in 9% (all ERG-negative), and two cases (ERG-negative) harbored a SPOP mutation. Compared to high grade conventional PCa matched for the pathological stage, cell proliferation was higher (P = 0.04) in DAC, and complete PTEN loss more frequent (P = 0.023). In multivariate analysis, SPINK1 overexpression (P = 0.017) and loss of PSA immunostaining (P = 0.02) were significantly associated with biochemical recurrence.

The hypothesis that faster age-related reduction in testosterone is linked with increased PCa risk remains untested. We conducted our study at a tertiary-level hospital in southeast of the USA, and derived data from the Medical Registry Database of individuals that were diagnosed of any prostate-related disease from 2001 to 2015. Cases were those diagnosed of PCa and had one or more measurements of testosterone prior to PCa diagnosis. Controls were those without PCa and had one or more testosterone measurements. Multivariable logistic regression models for PCa risk of absolute levels (one-time measure and 5-year average) and annual change in testosterone were respectively constructed. Among a total of 1,559 patients, 217 were PCa cases, and neither one-time measure nor 5-year average of testosterone was found to be significantly associated with PCa risk. Among the 379 patients with two or more testosterone measurements, 27 were PCa cases. For every 10 ng/dL increment in annual reduction of testosterone, the risk of PCa would increase by 14% [adjusted odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.25]. Compared to patients with a relatively stable testosterone, patients with an annual testosterone reduction of more than 30 ng/dL had 5.03 [95% CI: 1.53, 16.55] fold increase in PCa risk. This implies a faster age-related reduction in, but not absolute level of serum total testosterone as a risk factor for PCa.

Genetic variation in circadian rhythm genes provides a tool to investigate such associations. We examined associations of genetic variation in nine core circadian rhythm genes and six melatonin pathway genes with risk of colorectal, lung, ovarian and prostate cancers using data from the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON) network. The major results for prostate cancer were replicated in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial, and for colorectal cancer in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO). The total number of cancer cases and controls was 15,838/18,159 for colorectal, 14,818/14,227 for prostate, 12,537/17,285 for lung and 4,369/9,123 for ovary. For each cancer site, we conducted gene-based and pathway-based analyses by applying the summary-based Adaptive Rank Truncated Product method (sARTP) on the summary association statistics for each SNP within the candidate gene regions. Aggregate genetic variation in circadian rhythm and melatonin pathways were significantly associated with the risk of prostate cancer in data combining GAME-ON and PLCO, after Bonferroni correction (ppathway < 0.00625). The two most significant genes were NPAS2 (pgene = 0.0062) and AANAT (pgene = 0.00078); the latter being significant after Bonferroni correction. For colorectal cancer, we observed a suggestive association with the circadian rhythm pathway in GAME-ON (ppathway = 0.021); this association was not confirmed in GECCO (ppathway = 0.76) or the combined data (ppathway = 0.17). No significant association was observed for ovarian and lung cancer. These findings support a potential role for circadian rhythm and melatonin pathways in prostate carcinogenesis.

The return-to-work (RTW) process after disability can be conceptualized as a multi-phase construct. This study investigated RTW outcomes throughout the RTW process among survivors of prostate cancer (PC) attending a cancer rehabilitation measure.  Methods:   The study was based on a sample of 837 employed PC survivors enrolled in a longitudinal multicenter study. Data was collected at the beginning of the rehabilitation measure, at the end and at 12-month follow-up by means of self-report questionnaires. We compared outcomes with regard to age (<60 and ≥60 years) and socio-economic status (SES; lower, middle, higher) using t tests or univariate ANOVA for metrical and chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.  Results:   In the off-work phase, most survivors reported positive expectations regarding future work, including responsiveness of their work environment. Nevertheless, one fourth intended to apply for a disability pension. At 12-month follow-up, the RTW rate was 87% and 62% when applying more conservative criteria of RTW. Among survivors who had returned to work, most reported stability of the work situation. Survivors with lower SES showed least favorable outcomes throughout the RTW process, while older age was less consistently of negative impact.  Conclusions:   Survivors reported many favorable RTW outcomes, but low SES might be a barrier at various stages of the RTW process. Thus, special attention must be paid to the role of social inequalities during rehabilitation and work reintegration to help survivors managing the RTW process.""","""['Anneke Ullrich', 'Hilke M Rath', 'Ullrich Otto', 'Christa Kerschgens', 'Martin Raida', 'Christa Hagen-Aukamp', 'Corinna Bergelt']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Return to work in prostate cancer survivors - findings from a prospective study on occupational reintegration following a cancer rehabilitation program.', 'Return to work after breast cancer: The role of treatment-related side effects and potential impact on quality of life.', 'Sociodemographic and disease-related determinants of return to work among women with breast cancer: a German longitudinal cohort study.', 'Return to Work Among Stroke Survivors.', 'Return to work after a cancer diagnosis: a meta-review of reviews and a meta-synthesis of recent qualitative studies.', 'Development of an intervention for the social reintegration of adolescents and young adults affected by cancer.', 'Factors associated with returning to work and work ability of colorectal cancer survivors.', 'Long-term outcomes among localized prostate cancer survivors: prospective predictors for return-to-work three years after cancer rehabilitation.', 'Prostate Cancer Treatment and Work: A Scoping Review.', 'Insights into the Sustainable Return to Work of Aging Workers with a Work Disability: An Interpretative Description Study.']"""

Current understanding of metastatic disease is limited due to difficulty of sampling as prostate cancer mainly metastasizes to bone. By analysing prostate cancer bone metastases using high density microarrays, we found a common genomic copy number loss at 6q16.1-16.2, containing the FBXL4 gene, which was confirmed in larger series of bone metastases by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Loss of FBXL4 was also detected in primary tumours and it was highly associated with prognostic factors including high Gleason score, clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and extent of disease, as well as poor patient survival, suggesting that FBXL4 loss contributes to prostate cancer progression. We also demonstrated that FBXL4 deletion is detectable in circulating tumour cells (CTCs), making it a potential prognostic biomarker by 'liquid biopsy'. In vitro analysis showed that FBXL4 plays a role in regulating the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells. FBXL4 potentially controls cancer metastasis through regulation of ERLEC1 levels.

Unpaired Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test were used for comparisons between treatment groups, and logistic regression to asses how well our set of predictor variables predicts occurence of carcinoma. P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The mean age of 234 included patients was 66.8±11.5 years, and DM2 duration was 7± 6.49 years. Mean glucose value was 8.51±4.17mmol/L, and HbA1c 7.74±1.53. Metformin therapy was prescribed in 190 (81%) patients. Cancer was diagnosed in 16 (6.8%) patients: prostate cancer in eight (3.4%), breast cancer in four (1.7%), rectal cancer in two (0.9%) and cancer of the uterus and cervix in one patient. Age, duration of DM2 and BMI did not contribute significantly to the model, while metformin use was shown to be a significant independent predictor (OR=0.049; 95% CI=0.013-0.181; p=0.001). Conclusion Our findings support the hypothesis that the use of metformin compared to the use of other oral antidiabetic drugs is associated with a lower risk of cancer in patients with DM2.""","""['Jasna Kusturica', 'Aida Kulo Ćesić', 'Edis Gušić', 'Sanita Maleškić', 'Maida Rakanović-Todić', 'Damir Šečić']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Glas (Zenica)""","""['Association between metformin use and below-the-knee arterial calcification score in type 2 diabetic patients.', 'Association between hepatocellular carcinoma and type 2 diabetes mellitus in Italy: potential role of insulin.', 'Metformin and insulin impact on clinical outcome in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma receiving sorafenib: Validation study and biological rationale.', 'Pharmacogenetics of oral antidiabetic therapy.', 'Metformin and cancer risk in diabetic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Effect of Metformin Therapy on Biological Properties and Prognosis of Breast Cancer Patients Complicated with Type-2 Diabetes.', 'A national observation study of cancer incidence and mortality risks in type 2 diabetes compared to the background population over time.', 'Diabetes and its Potential Impact on Head and Neck Oncogenesis.', 'Effects of metformin on prostatic tissue of rats with metabolic syndrome and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Melatonin: A Molecule for Reducing Breast Cancer Risk.']"""

We investigated the associations of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) with circulating 25-OHD levels in cancer survivors, and determined whether associations differ by indoor and outdoor activity.  Design:   Cross-sectional study.  Setting:   The US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).  Participants:   Cancer survivors with available data on demographic information, measures of adiposity, smoking history, self-reported LTPA and circulating 25-OHD levels in five waves of NHANES (2001-2010).  Main outcomes measures:   Circulating 25-OHD levels.  Results:   Multivariable linear regression and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations of self-reported LTPA with 25-OHD, adjusting for potential confounders. Due to the differences in LTPA measure, the analyses were conducted separately for 2001-2006 and 2007-2010 data. We further estimated associations by indoor and outdoor activity in the 2001-2006 data. There were 1530 cancer survivors (mean age=60.5 years, mean body mass index=28.6 kg/m2). The prevalent cancer sites were breast (19.3%), prostate (18.8%), cervix (10.4%) and colon (8.6%). Compared with inactive cancer survivors, being physically active was associated with higher circulating 25-OHD levels (8.07 nmol/L, 95% CI 4.63 to 11.52) for 2001-2006 data. In the mutually adjusted model, higher outdoor activity (5.83 nmol/L, 95% CI 1.64 to 10.01), but not indoor activity (2.93 nmol/L, 95% CI -1.80 to 7.66), was associated with statistically significantly higher 25-OHD levels. The interaction between indoor and outdoor activities was, however, not significant (p=0.29). The only statistically significant association seen in the 2007-2010 data was among obese cancer survivors.  Conclusion:   Physical activity, particularly outdoor activity, is associated with higher 25-OHD levels in cancer survivors. In view of the possible beneficial effects of vitamin D on cancer prognosis, engaging in outdoor physical activity could provide clinically meaningful increases in 25-OHD levels among cancer survivors.""","""['Lin Yang', 'Adetunji T Toriola']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Inflammation Modifies the Association of Obesity with Circulating 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels in Cancer Survivors.', 'Association between leisure-time aerobic physical activity and vitamin D concentrations among US older adults: the NHANES 2007-2012.', 'Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status of adolescents and adults in two seasonal subpopulations from NHANES III.', 'Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and prognosis among cancer patients: a systematic review.', 'Vitamin D baseline levels at diagnosis of breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Lean Yet Unhealthy: Asian American Adults Had Higher Risks for Metabolic Syndrome than Non-Hispanic White Adults with the Same Body Mass Index: Evidence from NHANES 2011-2016.', 'Serum Vitamin D Concentration ≥75 nmol/L Is Related to Decreased Cardiometabolic and Inflammatory Biomarkers, Metabolic Syndrome, and Diabetes; and Increased Cardiorespiratory Fitness in US Adults.', 'Physical health composite and risk of cancer mortality in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke Study.', 'Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database (DSID) and the Application of Analytically Based Estimates of Ingredient Amount to Intake Calculations.', 'Passive Commuting and Higher Sedentary Time Is Associated with Vitamin D Deficiency in Adult and Older Women: Results from Chilean National Health Survey 2016⁻2017.']"""

However, CRPC remains an incurable disease due to the development of therapeutic resistance and the existence of cross-resistance between available therapies. Understanding the interplay between different treatments will lead to improved sequencing and the creation of combinations that overcome resistance and prolong survival. Whether there exists cross-resistance between docetaxel and the next-generation taxane cabazitaxel is poorly understood. In this study, we use C4-2B and DU145 derived docetaxel-resistant cell lines to test response to cabazitaxel. Our results demonstrate that docetaxel resistance confers cross-resistance to cabazitaxel. We show that increased ABCB1 expression is responsible for cross-resistance to cabazitaxel and that inhibition of ABCB1 function through the small-molecule inhibitor elacridar resensitizes taxane-resistant cells to treatment. In addition, the antiandrogens bicalutamide and enzalutamide, previously demonstrated to be able to resensitize taxane-resistant cells to docetaxel through inhibition of ABCB1 ATPase activity, are also able to resensitize resistant cells to cabazitaxel treatment. Finally, we show that resensitization using an antiandrogen is far more effective in combination with cabazitaxel than docetaxel. Collectively, these results address key concerns in the field, including that of cross-resistance between taxanes and highlighting a mechanism of cabazitaxel resistance involving ABCB1. Furthermore, these preclinical studies suggest the potential in using combinations of antiandrogens with cabazitaxel for increased effect in treating advanced CRPC.

It was proposed to mediate proteolytic processing of the transcription factor CCAAT-displacement protein/cut homeobox transcription factor (Cux1) from the full-length p200 isoform to generate the p110 and p90 isoforms, of which the p110 isoform was shown to act as a cell cycle regulator to accelerate entry into the S phase. The p110 isoform has also been shown to bind to the promoter regions of Snail and E-cadherin to activate Snail and inactivate E-cadherin transcription, thus promoting epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistic studies on what drives Cat L nuclear localization have not been reported. Our hypothesis is that Snail shuttles into the nucleus with Cat L through binding to importin-β. Snail knockdown with siRNA in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells led to nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling of Cat L and decreased levels of Cux1, while overexpression of Snail in MCF-7 breast cancer cells or HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells led to increased nuclear expression of both Cat L and Cux1. Additionally, transient transfection of Snail NLS mutants not only abrogated Snail nuclear localization but also nuclear localization of Cat L and Cux1. Interestingly, importin β1 knockdown with siRNA decreased Snail and Cux1 levels, as well as nuclear localization of Cat L. Therefore, we show for the first time that the nuclear localization of Cat L and its substrate Cux1can be positively regulated by Snail NLS and importin β1, suggesting that Snail, Cat L and Cux1 all utilize importin β1 for nuclear import.""","""['Liza J Burton', 'Veronica Henderson', 'Latiffa Liburd', 'Valerie A Odero-Marah']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Targeting the Nuclear Cathepsin L CCAAT Displacement Protein/Cut Homeobox Transcription Factor-Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition Pathway in Prostate and Breast Cancer Cells with the Z-FY-CHO Inhibitor.', 'CCAAT-displacement protein/cut homeobox transcription factor (CUX1) represses estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) in triple-negative breast cancer cells and can be antagonized by muscadine grape skin extract (MSKE).', 'Identification of a nuclear localization signal and importin beta members mediating NUAK1 nuclear import inhibited by oxidative stress.', 'The multiple roles of CUX1: insights from mouse models and cell-based assays.', 'Snail nuclear transport: the gateways regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition?', 'Cystatin B deficiency results in sustained histone H3 tail cleavage in postnatal mouse brain mediated by increased chromatin-associated cathepsin L activity.', 'SERPINB3 (SCCA1) inhibits cathepsin L and lysoptosis, protecting cervical cancer cells from chemoradiation.', 'Subcellular Localization of Epstein-Barr Virus BLLF2 and Its Underlying Mechanisms.', 'Role of lysosomes in physiological activities, diseases, and therapy.', 'Oncogenes in high grade serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary.']"""

Moreover, we examined AKAP12 and Semaphorin 3F mRNA expression in 42 prostate cancer and 30 benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue samples, and found that the expression of AKAP12 and Semaphorin 3F mRNA was inversely associated with the degree of aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells and tissues. An ordinal logistic regression analysis indicates that there is a positive association between the expression of AKAP12 and Semaphorin 3F in prostate cancer, suggesting that the activation of Semaphorin 3F by SSeCKS/AKAP12 may be involved in prostate cancer progression and metastasis.""","""['Wen Xie', 'Wei Su', 'Lijuan Zhang', 'Qingkun Shang', 'Bing Su']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Loss of the SSeCKS/Gravin/AKAP12 gene results in prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The Src-suppressed C kinase substrate, SSeCKS, is a potential metastasis inhibitor in prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative assessment of AKAP12 promoter methylation in human prostate cancer using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting: correlation with Gleason score.', 'Suppression of tumor and metastasis progression through the scaffolding functions of SSeCKS/Gravin/AKAP12.', 'The Mechanism and Influence of AKAP12 in Different Cancers.']"""

Channel activity promoted BCa invasion of Matrigel®in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Consequently, expression of nNav1.5 has been proposed as a functional biomarker of BCa cells with metastatic potential. Here, we have determined immunohistochemically both nNav1.5 and total VGSC (tVGSC) protein expression in a range of adult human tissues. Some VGSC protein was expressed in normal colon, small intestine, stomach, prostate, bladder and breast. As expected, high levels of VGSC protein were expressed in brain, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. On the other hand, nNav1.5 protein was not expressed in any of the normal tissues tested except breast where a low-level of protein was present. In comparison to normal breast, nNav1.5 protein expression in BCa was consistently widespread and occurred at a significantly higher level. We also questioned whether there was any relationship between the nNav1.5 protein expression and the estrogen receptor (ERα) status of BCa and obtained the following results. First, all cases lacking nNav1.5 were positive for ERα. Second, in all ERα-negative tissues, nNav1.5 protein was expressed in plasma membrane. Third, however, in ERα-positive cases, nNav1.5 protein expression was observed in both plasma membrane and cytoplasm. In conclusion, nNav1.5 protein has a restricted expression pattern among human tissues. High level expression occurs in BCa and associates with ERα status.

The beneficial effects of ALA on chronic diseases are still in dispute, unlike those of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).  Methods:   The primary objective of this investigation was to evaluate the efficiency of ALA uptake from a vegetable oil source and its subsequent conversion to n-3 long-chain PUFAs (LCPUFAs) in the tissues of growing mice, and to investigate its protective role in a prostate cancer animal model. We carried out the investigation in prostate-specific Pten-knockout mice with specified low-ALA (L-ALA, 2.5%) and high-ALA (H-ALA, 7.5%) diets. Total fatty acids in blood, liver, epididymal fat pad, prostate were detected and prostate weight were adjusted for body weight (mg/25 g).  Results:   We found that dietary ALA triggered significant increases in ALA, EPA, docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and DHA levels and a significant decrease in arachidonic acid levels during the mice's growth stage. A dose-dependent effect was observed for ALA, EPA and DPA, but not DHA. Furthermore, the average prostate weights in the L-ALA and H-ALA groups were lower than those in the control and n-6 groups, and similar to those in the EPA and n-3 groups.

Methods:   PICK1 expression is evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 198 PCa patients. Statistical analysis is performed to explore correlation between PICK1 expression and clinicopathological features in PCa patients. The biological role of PICK1 is examined in PC-3 and C4-2B cells in vitro and a mouse intracardial model in vivo.  Results:   PICK1 expression is decreased in PCa tissues with bone metastasis and bone-derived cells and downregulation of PICK1 positively correlates with serum PSA level, Gleason grade and bone metastasis status in PCa patients. Overexpression of PICK1 suppresses PCa cell invasion and migration in vitro and bone metastasis in vivo.

We sought to examine the impact of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on receipt of PSA testing among low-income men.  Methods:   Black (n=22 167) and White (n=9588) men aged ⩾40 years completed a baseline questionnaire from 2002 to 2009 as part of the Southern Community Cohort Study. Men reported whether they had ever received PSA testing and had testing within the prior 12 months. To evaluate the associations between SES, race and receipt of PSA testing, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from the multivariable logistic models where age, household income, insurance status, marital status, body mass index and educational level were adjusted.  Results:   Black men were younger, had a lower income, less attained education and were more likely to be unmarried and uninsured (all P<0.001). Percentages of men having ever received PSA testing rose from <40% under the age of 45 years to ~90% above the age of 65 years, with Whites >50 more likely than Blacks to have received testing. Lower SES was significantly associated with less receipt of PSA testing in both groups. After adjustment for SES, White men had significantly lower odds of PSA testing (OR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.76-0.87).  Conclusions:   Greater PSA testing among White than Black men over the age of 50 years in this low-income population appears to be mainly a consequence of SES.

Androgens have long been considered to be the potential risk factors for PCa. However, the role of testosterone is controversial. The present study aims to analyze the relationship between serum testosterone (TS) levels and the diagnosis of PCa after a first prostate biopsy in patients affected by ASAP. This retrospective study included 143 patients diagnosed with ASAP in an initial transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy for suspicious PCa according to the European Association of Urology guidelines. Their TS levels, age, PSA, prostate volume, digital rectal examination, and prostate biopsy Gleason score (GS) were collected retrospectively for statistical analysis. All patients included in the study had a second biopsy and were suitable for further analysis. Re-biopsy was carried out 3-6 months after the first diagnosis of ASAP. Low and normal TS groups were composed of 29 (20.3%) and 114 (79.7%) patients, respectively. The diagnosis of the second biopsy was ASAP in 25.2% and PCa in 36.4% of patients. The comparison between patients with PCa and those with negative or an ASAP result in the second biopsy reported that men with cancer had significantly higher levels of TS (P < 0.001). However, there was no statistically significant association between GS postbiopsy and TS (P = 0.324).

However, an incomplete understanding of the factors that influence binding of αvβ3 integrin-specific radiotracers currently limits their use for assessing response to therapy in cancer patients. This study identifies two fundamental factors that modulate uptake of these radiotracers. Procedures Experiments were performed in prostate cancer (PC3) and glioblastoma (U87MG) cells, which differentially express αvβ3 integrin. αvβ3 integrin-specific radiotracers were used to investigate the effect of manipulating αvβ3 integrin expression or activation in cellular binding assays. β3 integrin and αvβ3 integrin expression were measured by western blotting and flow cytometry, respectively. The effect of select pharmacological inhibitors on αvβ3 integrin activation and expression was also determined.  Results:   Radiotracer binding was proportional to αvβ3 integrin expression when it was decreased (β3 knock-down cells) or increased, either using pharmacological inhibitors of cell signalling or by culturing cells for different times. Studies with both small molecule and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-based radiotracers revealed increased radiotracer binding after activation of αvβ3 integrin with Mn2+ or talin head domain. Moreover, inhibition of fundamental signalling pathways (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), Src and VEGFR2) decreased radiotracer binding, reflecting reduced αvβ3 integrin activity.  Conclusion:   Binding of small molecule ligands and radiolabelled RGD peptides is modulated by expression and activation status of αvβ3 integrin. αvβ3 integrin-specific radiotracers can provide otherwise inaccessible information of the effect of signalling pathways on αvβ3 integrin.

Patients and methods:   We included 203 patients on a 5-ARI from our institutional database comprising over 2500 patients who had been treated with either external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer. Patients received a 5-ARI for urinary symptoms or active surveillance. Cancer progressions at the time of definitive treatment were analyzed according to the following criteria: (a) progression of Gleason score or increase in cancer volume on biopsy, (b) first biopsy positive for cancer after being treated for urinary symptoms with a 5-ARI, and (c) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression with or without a previous cancer diagnosis. Biochemical failure (BF) was defined by the Phoenix definition. Log-rank test was used for survival analysis.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 38.2 months (standard deviation 22.2 months), 10 (4.9%) patients experienced BF. Concerning prostate cancer progression criteria, 52% of men demonstrated none, 37% showed only one criterion, and 11% showed two. Using univariate analysis, PSA progression (p = 0.004) and appearance of a positive biopsy (p < 0.001) were significant predictive factors for BF, while Gleason progression (p = 0.3) was not. In multivariate analysis adjusted for cancer aggressiveness, rising PSA (hazard ratio, HR, 5.7; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.1-28.8; p = 0.04) and the number of cancer progression factors (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.2-7.0, p = 0.02) remained adverse risk factors.

One prostate cancer (PC-3) and two osteosarcoma (MG63 and HOS) cell lines were modified with luciferase reporter genes. To create engineered tumors, these cell lines were seeded either onto basement membrane extract (BME) or gelfoam scaffolds, and subsequently grafted in vivo onto the CAM. BLI enabled non-invasive, specific detection of the engineered tumors on the CAM in the living chicken embryo. Further, BLI permitted daily, quantitative monitoring of the engineered tumors over the course of up to 7 days. Data showed that an extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of BME supported growth of reporter gene marked PC-3 tumors but did not support MG63 or HOS tumor growth. However, MG63 tumors engineered on the collagen-based gelfoam ECM showed a temporal proliferation burst in MG63 tumors.

While neoplastic lesions of the prostate may cause aberrant levels of PSA in the blood, the quantitation of free or complexed PSA poorly discriminates cancer patients from those developing benign lesions, often leading to invasive and unnecessary surgical procedures. Microenvironmental acidity increases exosome release by cancer cells. In this study we evaluated whether acidity, a critical phenotype of malignancy, could influence exosome release and increase the PSA expression in nanovesicles released by PCa cells. To this aim, we exploited Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), an immunocapture-based ELISA, and nanoscale flow-cytometry. The results show that microenvironmental acidity induces an increased release of nanovesicles expressing both PSA and the exosome marker CD81. In order to verify whether the changes induced by the local selective pressure of extracellular acidity may correspond to a clinical pathway we used the same approach to evaluate the levels of PSA-expressing exosomes in the plasma of PCa patients and controls, including subjects with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). The results show that only PCa patients have high levels of nanovesicles expressing both CD81 and PSA. This study shows that tumor acidity exerts a selective pressure leading to the release of extracellular vesicles that express both PSA and exosome markers. A comparable scenario was shown in the plasma of prostate cancer patients as compared to both BPH and healthy controls. These results suggest that microenvironmental acidity may represent a key factor which determines qualitatively and quantitatively the release of extracellular vesicles by malignant tumors, including prostate cancer. This condition leads to the spill-over of nanovesicles into the peripheral blood of prostate cancer patients, where the levels of tumor biomarkers expressed by exosomes, such as PSA-exosomes, may represent a novel, non-invasive clinical tool for the screening and early diagnosis of prostate cancer.""","""['Mariantonia Logozzi', 'Daniela F Angelini', 'Elisabetta Iessi', 'Davide Mizzoni', 'Rossella Di Raimo', 'Cristina Federici', 'Luana Lugini', 'Giovanna Borsellino', 'Alessandro Gentilucci', 'Federico Pierella', 'Vittorio Marzio', 'Alessandro Sciarra', 'Luca Battistini', 'Stefano Fais']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Increased Plasmatic Levels of PSA-Expressing Exosomes Distinguish Prostate Cancer Patients from Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: A Prospective Study.', 'A Prospective Adaptive Utility Trial to Validate Performance of a Novel Urine Exosome Gene Expression Assay to Predict High-grade Prostate Cancer in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen 2-10ng/ml at Initial Biopsy.', 'Nanoscale flow cytometry to distinguish subpopulations of prostate extracellular vesicles in patient plasma.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

We investigated whether the frameshift nature of indel mutations, which create novel open reading frames and a large quantity of mutagenic peptides highly distinct from self, might contribute to the immunogenic phenotype.  Methods:   We analysed whole-exome sequencing data from 5777 solid tumours, spanning 19 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We compared the proportion and number of indels across the cohort, with a subset of results replicated in two independent datasets. We assessed in-silico tumour-specific neoantigen predictions by mutation type with pan-cancer analysis, together with RNAseq profiling in renal clear cell carcinoma cases (n=392), to compare immune gene expression across patient subgroups. Associations between indel burden and treatment response were assessed across four checkpoint inhibitor datasets.  Findings:   We observed renal cell carcinomas to have the highest proportion (0·12) and number of indel mutations across the pan-cancer cohort (p<2·2 × 10-16), more than double the median proportion of indel mutations in all other cancer types examined. Analysis of tumour-specific neoantigens showed that enrichment of indel mutations for high-affinity binders was three times that of non-synonymous SNV mutations. Furthermore, neoantigens derived from indel mutations were nine times enriched for mutant specific binding, as compared with non-synonymous SNV derived neoantigens. Immune gene expression analysis in the renal clear cell carcinoma cohort showed that the presence of mutant-specific neoantigens was associated with upregulation of antigen presentation genes, which correlated (r=0·78) with T-cell activation as measured by CD8-positive expression. Finally, analysis of checkpoint inhibitor response data revealed frameshift indel count to be significantly associated with checkpoint inhibitor response across three separate melanoma cohorts (p=4·7 × 10-4).  Interpretation:   Renal cell carcinomas have the highest pan-cancer proportion and number of indel mutations. Evidence suggests indels are a highly immunogenic mutational class, which can trigger an increased abundance of neoantigens and greater mutant-binding specificity.

Methods:   This study used a descriptive, correlational design to assess a sample of 133 individuals with PC. The participants were face-to-face interviewed to collect demographic data and disease characteristics, assess self-control schedule, and survey health status. Correlation analysis, Student's t-test, ANOVA, and regression analysis were applied.  Results:   Over half the patients had depressive symptoms, and 96.1% had erectile dysfunction. Lack of resourcefulness was found to decrease PC-specific quality of life (PCQOL) and physical quality of life (PQOL). The participants who were more resourceful showed a better mental quality of life (MQOL) and PQOL (r=0.53**; r=0.41**) and fewer DSs (r=-0.52**). Most participants were stage II and IV, and there were significantly different effects on PQOL and MQOL related to cancer stage. Regarding the different outcomes of various therapies, the findings suggested that survivors of PC who underwent radical prostatectomy were more likely to have a better MQOL than those who underwent other treatments. In addition, resourcefulness had mediating effects on pain, PQOL/MQOL, and DSs in the patients with PC.

However, the clinical significance and biological roles of miR-210-3p in PCa bone metastasis remain obscure.  Methods:   miR-210-3p expression was evaluated by real-time PCR in 68 bone metastatic and 81 non-bone metastatic PCa tissues. The biological roles of miR-210-3p in the bone metastasis of PCa were investigated both in vitro by EMT and Transwell assays, and in vivo using a mouse model of left cardiac ventricle inoculation. Bioinformatics analysis, real-time PCR, western blot and luciferase reporter analysis were applied to discern and examine the relationship between miR-210-3p and its potential targets. RT-PCR was performed to identify the underlying mechanism of miR-210-3p overexpression in bone metastasis of PCa. Clinical correlation of miR-210-3p with its targets was examined in human PCa and metastatic bone tissues.  Results:   miR-210-3p expression is elevated in bone metastatic PCa tissues compared with non-bone metastatic PCa tissues. Overexpression of miR-210-3p positively correlates with serum PSA levels, Gleason grade and bone metastasis status in PCa patients. Upregulating miR-210-3p enhances, while silencing miR-210-3p represses the EMT, invasion and migration of PCa cells in vitro. Importantly, silencing miR-210-3p significantly inhibits bone metastasis of PC-3 cells in vivo. Our results further demonstrate that miR-210-3p maintains the sustained activation of NF-κB signaling via targeting negative regulators of NF-κB signaling (TNF-α Induced Protein 3 Interacting Protein 1) TNIP1 and (Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling 1) SOCS1, resulting in EMT, invasion, migration and bone metastasis of PCa cells. Moreover, our results further indicate that recurrent gains (amplification) contribute to miR-210-3p overexpression in a small number of PCa patients. The clinical correlation of miR-210-3p with SOCS1, TNIP1 and NF-κB signaling activity is verified in PCa tissues.

Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis was performed to search for candidate CNVs associated with NMIBC susceptibility. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was carried out to evaluate CNVs associated with patient outcome in 189 NMIBC cases. In total, 11 CNVs were associated with NMIBC risk in array CGH analysis. Out of the 189 CNVs examined, family with sequence similarity 81 member A (FAM81A) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 6 (PCSK6) CNVs exhibited a significant association with recurrence and disease progression in NMIBC. PCSK6 has been reported to regulate proliferation and tumor progression in breast and prostate malignancies. Notably, patients with pT1 stage had significantly lower PCSK6 relative copy number than those with pTa (P=0.0196). In multivariate analyses, PCSK6 copy number was an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (P=0.0456; risk ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-4.82).

Here we report that p53 is translocated to the cytoplasm by androgen-mediated induction of G3BP2, a newly described direct target gene of AR. G3BP2 induces both cell cycle progression and blocks apoptosis. Translocation of p53 is regulated by androgen-dependent sumoylation mediated by the G3BP2-interacting SUMO-E3 ligase, RanBP2. G3BP2 knockdown results in reduced tumor growth and increased nuclear p53 accumulation in mouse xenograft models of prostate cancer with or without long-term androgen deprivation. Moreover, strong cytoplasmic p53 localization is correlated clinically with elevated G3BP2 expression and predicts poor prognosis and disease progression to the hormone-refractory state.

The objective of this study was to assess the clinical usefulness of MLCs in prostate SBRT by comparing the effectiveness of treatment plans using fixed collimators, variable collimators, and MLCs and by ensuring delivery quality assurance (DQA) for each. For each patient who underwent conventional radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer, mock SBRT plans were created using a fixed collimator, a variable collimator, and an MLC. The total MUs, treatment times, and dose-volume histograms of the planning target volumes and organs at risk for each treatment plan were compared. For DQA, a phantom with a radiochromic film or an ionization chamber was irradiated in each plan. We performed gamma-index analysis to evaluate the consistency between the measured and calculated doses. The MLC-based plans had an ~27% lower average total MU than the plans involving other collimators. Moreover, the average estimated treatment time for the MLC plan was 31% and 20% shorter than that for the fixed and variable collimator plans respectively. The gamma-index passing rate in the DQA using film measurements was slightly lower for the MLC than for the other collimators. The DQA results acquired using the ionization chamber showed that the discrepancies between the measured and calculated doses were within 3% in all cases. The results reinforce the usefulness of MLCs in robotic radiosurgery for prostrate SBRT treatment planning; most notably, the total MU and treatment time were both reduced compared to the cases using other types of collimators. Moreover, although the DQA results based on film dosimetry yielded a slightly lower gamma-index passing rate for the MLC than for the other collimators, the MLC accuracy was determined to be sufficient for clinical use.""","""['Masashi Tomida', 'Takeshi Kamomae', 'Junji Suzuki', 'Yoichi Ohashi', 'Yoshiyuki Itoh', 'Hiroshi Oguchi', 'Takahito Okuda']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Investigating the clinical advantages of a robotic linac equipped with a multileaf collimator in the treatment of brain and prostate cancer patients.', 'Impact of collimator leaf width on stereotactic radiosurgery and 3D conformal radiotherapy treatment plans.', 'The impact of a high-definition multileaf collimator for spine SBRT.', ""Do all the linear accelerators comply with the ICRU 91's constraints for stereotactic body radiation therapy treatments?"", 'A review and analysis of stereotactic body radiotherapy and radiosurgery of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices.', 'Development of a high-resolution two-dimensional detector-based dose verification system for tumor-tracking irradiation in the CyberKnife system.', 'Development of raster scanning IMRT using a robotic radiosurgery system.', 'Clinical impact of the VOLO optimizer on treatment plan quality and clinical treatment efficiency for CyberKnife.', 'Steeper dose gradients resulting from reduced source to target distance-a planning system independent study.']"""

Androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7), one of the causes of CRPC, is correlated with resistance to a new-generation AR antagonist (enzalutamide) and poor prognosis. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) inhibitor is known to decrease the levels of full-length AR (AR-FL), but little is known about its effects against CRPC cells expressing AR-V7. In this study, we investigated the effect of the Hsp70 inhibitors quercetin and VER155008 in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP95 that expresses AR-V7, and explored the mechanism by which Hsp70 regulates AR-FL and AR-V7 expression. Quercetin and VER155008 decreased cell proliferation, increased the proportion of apoptotic cells, and decreased the protein levels of AR-FL and AR-V7. Furthermore, VER155008 decreased AR-FL and AR-V7 mRNA levels. Immunoprecipitation with Hsp70 antibody and mass spectrometry identified Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) as one of the molecules regulating AR-FL and AR-V7 at the transcription level through interaction with Hsp70. VER155008 decreased the phosphorylation of YB-1 and its localization in the nucleus, indicating that the involvement of Hsp70 in AR regulation might be mediated through the activation and nuclear translocation of YB-1.

Western blots were used to test the molecular linkages among extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and downstream signal molecules. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were used to detect cell death. Cell proliferation assay showed that SFN-Cys inhibited cell viability following a dose-dependent manner. Abnormal cell morphology was viewed after the cells were exposed to SFN-Cys. Flow cytometry showed that SFN-Cys induced cell apoptosis via a dose-dependent manner. Further, SFN-Cys triggered the activation of ERK1/2, which resulted in the upregulation of maspin, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and downregulation of pro-caspase-3, Bcl-2, α-tubulin. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that recombinant caspase-3 cleaved α-tubulin in the lysate of cells, which were treated by SFN-Cys. These data indicated that SFN-Cys activated the ERK1/2-mediated mitochondria signaling pathway with maspin upregulation and α-tubulin downregulation leading to apoptosis.

Arginase showed optimum activity at pH 8 and temperature 35 °C. Mn2+ and Mg2+ ions enhanced arginase activity while, Li+, Cu2+, and Al3+ ions reduced arginase activity. In-vitro serum half-life of arginase was 36 h and proteolytic half-life against trypsin and proteinase-K was 25 and 29 min, respectively. Anticancer activity of arginase was evaluated against colon, breast, leukemia, and prostate cancer cell lines and lowest IC50 (0.8 IU ml-1) was found against leukemia cell line HL-60. Microscopic studies and flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V/PI staining of HL-60 cells revealed that arginase induced apoptosis in dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis suggested that arginase induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. The increasing level of MMP loss, ROS generation and decreasing level of SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH suggested that arginase treatment triggered dysfunctioning of mitochondria. The cleavage of caspase-3, PARP-1, activations of caspase-8, 9 and high expression of proapoptotic protein Bax, low expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 indicated that arginase treatment activates mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.

Worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence has been on the rise. It is currently the third most common cancer in men (746,000 cases, 10.0% of the total) and the second in women (614,000 cases, 9.2% of the total).1 Arecent meta-analysis reported a 61% risk reduction in CRC incidence with colonoscopy.2 Unlike screening programs for breast and prostate cancers, not only has CRC screening reduced mortality from colon cancer and detected early CRC, it has also decreased the incidence of CRC through detection and removal of pre-cancerous lesions. Studies have shown that screening for colorectal cancer provided 152 to 313 life-years-gained (LYG) per 1000 forty-year-old individuals.3 Anumber of modalities exist for CRC screening, which can broadly be categorized into stool-based tests and direct visualization tests. Stool-based tests include fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) and stool DNAtesting. Direct visualization tests include endoscopic procedures such as colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy; and radiographic tests such as CT colonography, which has largely replaced air contrast barium enemas.4 The only reported population-based data for CRC in Pakistan comes from Bhurgri et al. in 2011.5It described Pakistan as a low risk region with an age standardized incidence rate (ASR) world per 100,000 of 7.1 in males and 5.2 in females, but with a much younger age and advanced stage at diagnosis. The ratio for individuals diagnosed with CRC under the age of 40, as oppose to over 40 years, was 3:1, which is much higher than the international average. Noteworthy as well, is an increase in incidence especially among men, noted between the study periods of 1995-1997 and 1997-2002. It ranks 7th in incidence among males, and 8th among females, with tobacco related malignancies topping the list.6 There has since been additional cross-sectional data from Pakistan echoing these findings of a younger age and advanced disease at presentation.7 Speaking from a public health perspective, Pakistan, while still battling communicable diseases, is now seeing an increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases population-based screening programs for CRC were not justified in most developing countries, citing low reported incidence and low resource health authorities; but that in limited regions with an ageing population and a shift to Western lifestyle, organized screening strategies needed to be developed. This can well be extrapolated to large urban centers in Pakistan. In a resource poor, conservative country like Pakistan, with poor health literacy, there exist many barriers to CRC screening which were summed up very articulately by Ahmed F in 2013. Quite appropriately, areas identified for further pursuit included, among others, the training of gastroenterologists, especially female ones, less expensive and more culturally acceptable screening options, and cost-effectiveness analyses. The recipe for any cancer screening program to be successful, begins with epidemiological data to document disease burden. There has not been any population-based cancer registry to report incidence data for the past few years. There is also no centralized cancer registry to effectively unify and coordinate data from across the country. Furthermore, even with a cancer registry there is no mandated reporting of malignancies from a health policy standpoint, as exists in the more developed world. The last population-based data we have for CRC was for cases reported until 2002, and there was already an increase in incidence noted in less than a decade, starting in 1995.5 Health awareness is another important factor. There is no data from Pakistan regarding patient or physician awareness regarding colon cancer. If one is to extrapolate, a cross-sectional study on breast cancer awareness, for which Pakistan demonstrates one of the highest incidences worldwide,6 reported that a mammogram had been performed in only 4.9 % of women in the cohort, while 61.5 % of the remainder had never even heard about it.7 It is also unclear if we have the infrastructure including endoscopy centers and adequate numbers of gastroenterologists to service the population at large. FOBTis available and cheap, but there is no data regarding the availability of FITor stool DNAtesting. In the absence of health insurance, it will certainly be a challenge to make CRC screening widely accessible. At what point does a disease warrant attention? While we may not have the luxury or the immediate necessity to introduce mass population-based CRC screening, we can certainly start with individual screening in populations who are at high risk of colorectal cancer due to family history and have adequate access to healthcare. There should be a concerted drive to revitalize cancer registration in order to guide health policy and to have an effective national cancer control program. Awareness programs are also needed to be established for the public and, specifically, for physicians as well.""","""['Hadi Bhurgri', 'Sami Samiullah']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Coll Physicians Surg Pak""","""['Screening for Colorectal Cancer: An Updated Systematic Review Internet.', 'Screening for Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Fecal occult blood test for colorectal cancer screening: an evidence-based analysis.', 'Screening for Colorectal Cancer: An Evidence Update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Longitudinal Rates of Colon Cancer Screening Use in Winnipeg, Canada: The Experience of a Universal Health-Care System with an Organized Colon Screening Program.', 'Comprehensive genomic profiling of colorectal cancer patients reveals differences in mutational landscapes among clinical and pathological subgroups.', 'Colibactin possessing E. coli isolates in association with colorectal cancer and their genetic diversity among Pakistani population.', 'Association between ERCC1 Gene Polymorphism (rs11615) and Colorectal Cancer Susceptibility: A Meta-Analysis of Medical Image Fusion and Safety Applications.', 'The implementation of colorectal cancer screening interventions in low-and middle-income countries: a scoping review.', 'Effect of HtrA1 Polymorphism on Sensitivity to Chemotherapy in Patients with Colon Cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   We analysed archived plasma samples prospectively collected from patients with early prostate cancer in a single-institution AS study. Of 825 patients enrolled, 542 had ≥1 year of follow-up. Baseline and longitudinal plasma Cav-1 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tumour volume or Gleason grade increases were criteria for DR. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations between clinicopathological characteristics and reclassification risk.  Results:   In 542 patients, 480 (88.6%) had stage cT1c disease, 542 (100.0%) had a median prostate-specific antigen level of 4.1 ng/mL, and 531 (98.0%) had a median Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score of 1.

Patients and methods:   Between 2008 and 2013, 373 consecutive men with localized prostate cancer were treated with SBRT at a single academic institution as part of a prospective clinical trial or prospective registry. Prospective longitudinal patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data was collected using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26 instrument. Functional erections were strictly defined as 'firm enough for intercourse' according to EPIC-26. Detailed comorbidity data were also collected. Logistic regression models were used to predict 24- and 60-month functional erection rates. Observed erection rates after SBRT were compared with those after other radiation therapies (external beam radiation therapy [EBRT] and brachytherapy) using prospectively validated models.  Results:   The median (interquartile range) follow-up was 56 (37-73) months and the response rate at 2 years was 84%. For those with functional erections at baseline, 57% and 45% retained function at 24 and 60 months, respectively. On multivariable analysis for 24-month erectile function, significant variables included higher baseline sexual HRQoL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.55 per 10 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-1.74; P < 0.001) and older age (aOR 0.66 per 10 years, 95% CI 0.43-1.00; P = 0.05). At 60 months, baseline HRQoL and age remained associated with erectile function, along with body mass index (aOR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.78; P < 0.001). The 24- and 60-month models had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.81 and 0.84, respectively). Erection rates after SBRT were not statistically different from model-predicted rates after EBRT or brachytherapy for the whole cohort and the cohort with baseline erectile function.  Conclusions:   Intermediate- to long-term post-SBRT erectile function results are promising and not significantly different from other radiotherapy techniques.

The secondary aim of the study was to report preliminary data and in particular potency recovery data.  Patients and methods:   This was a single-centre, single-arm prospective study, enrolling all patients with localised prostate cancer scheduled for RARP with five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function scores of >17, from July 2015 to September 2016. All patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. The demographics, perioperative, postoperative and complications data were evaluated. Potency recovery data were evaluated in particular and any sign/symptom of local allergy/intolerance to the ChiMe was recorded and evaluated.  Results:   In all, 140 patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. Applying the ChiMe was easy in almost all the cases, and did not compromise the safety of the procedure. None of the patients reported signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging.  Conclusion:   In our experience, ChiMe applied on the NVBs after NS-RARP was feasible and safe, without compromising the duration, difficulty or complication rate of the 'standard' procedure.

Post-treatment incontinence has been reported to occur 6-69%, yet no truly patient-centered report has been compiled. We evaluated patient-reported incontinence rates and bother scores after treatment for prostate cancer.  Methods:   The NHANES database was queried for all men who reported a diagnosis and treatment of PCa from 2001 to 2010. A control arm of men without a diagnosis of PCa age 60-80 years was constructed for baseline incontinence rates. Incontinence was patient-reported and obtained through questionnaires. Three additional cohorts were created for patients treated with RP, XRT or combination RP and XRT.  Results:   We identified 316 men treated for prostate cancer, of which 136 reported RP and 125 reported XRT, who were compared to 3534 controls. Men that underwent RP experience significant incontinence rates of 23% compared to 12% of those patients treated with XRT, whereas those patients with combined therapy had incontinence rates of 52% (p < 0.0001). Bother scores did not significantly vary, but were increased compared to baseline. Urge incontinence did not differ between treatment groups, but stress incontinence was significantly higher in surgical patients.  Conclusion:   These data from a nationwide sample of patient-reported urinary outcomes have limited interviewer bias and report significantly higher incontinence rates, which may impact prostate cancer discussions.

Recent data show that Yo antibodies also target the CDR2-like protein (CDR2L). We, therefore, examined the expression of CDR2 and CDR2L in ovarian cancer tissue from patients with and without Yo antibodies and from various other cancerous and normal human tissues.  Methods:   Ovarian cancer tissue and serum samples from 16 patients were included in the study (four with anti-Yo and PCD, two with anti-Yo without PCD, five with only CDR2L antibodies, and five without onconeural antibodies). Clinical data were available for all patients. The human tissues were examined by western blot and immunohistochemistry using rabbit CDR2 and CDR2L antibodies.  Results:   Ovarian cancers from all 16 patients expressed CDR2 and CDR2L proteins. Both proteins were also present in normal and cancer tissue from mammary tissue, kidney, ovary, prostate, and testis.

Furthermore, both molecules are also present in the membrane of cells derived from other reproductive tissues such as the breast, endometrium, ovary, and prostate, as well as in tumors derived from these tissues. The functions of GnRH receptor and its hormone in malignant cells have been related with the decrease of proliferation and the invasiveness of those tumors however, little is known about the molecules associated with the signaling pathways regulated by both molecules in malignant cells. To further analyze the potential mechanisms employed by the GnRHR/GnRH system to reduce the tumorigenesis of the highly invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, we performed microarrays experiments to evaluated changes in genes expression and validate these modifications by functional assays. We show that activation of human GnRHR is able to diminish the expression and therefore functions of the Rho GTPase-Activating Protein 18 (ARHGAP18). Decrease of this GAP following GnRHR activation, correlates to the higher of cell adhesion and also with reduction of tumor cell invasion, supporting the notion that GnRHR triggers intracellular signaling pathways that acts through ARHGAP18.

Punicalagin (PN), polyphenol from pomegranate fruit, is known to exhibit potent anticancer activity in lung, breast and cervical cells. However, there is paucity of information on its effect in PCa. This study evaluated anti-proliferative effects of PN and its effects on extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in PCa cells, and angiogenesis in chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Antioxidant activities of PN were determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO) methods. PCa (PC-3 and LNCaP) and normal prostate (BPH-1) cells were cultured and treated with PN (10, 50 and 100 μM). Cytotoxicity and viability effects of PN were determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and XTT assays, respectively. Antiangiogenic effects were measured using CAM assay, while apoptosis was assessed by DNA fragmentation, enrichment factor by Cell Death Detection ELISA kit and expressions of caspases-3 and -8. Results showed that PN (10-200 μM) significantly scavenged DPPH and inhibited LPO in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, PN (10-100 μM) concentration-dependently inhibited viability in PC-3 and LNCaP, while viability in BPH-1 was insignificantly affected. PN had low toxicity on cells in vitro at concentrations tested. Also, PN (100 μM) increased enrichment factor in PC-3 (2.34 ± 0.05) and LNCaP (2.31 ± 0.26) relative to control (1.00 ± 0.00). In addition, PN (50 μM) decreased the network of vessels in CAM, suggesting its anti-angiogenic effect. Moreso, PN increased the expressions of caspases-3 and -8 in PC-3.

However, to our knowledge it is unknown whether dynamic contrast enhanced imaging separates lesions into clinically meaningful pathological groups. We examined whether dynamic contrast enhanced imaging would improve the detection of clinically significant cancer.  Materials and methods:   We identified patients without a prior diagnosis of prostate cancer who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy of peripheral zone lesions with a diffusion-weighted imaging score of 3 or 4. Each lesion was grouped into 1 of 3 classifications, including group 1-diffusion-weighted imaging score 3/nonenhancing/PI-RADS score 3, group 2-diffusion-weighted imaging score 3/enhancing/PI-RADS score 4 or group 3-diffusion-weighted imaging score 4/PI-RADS score 4. We measured the rate of grade group 2 or greater pathology detected for each lesion group with subgroup analyses in patients with vs without prior negative systematic biopsy.  Results:   We identified a total of 389 peripheral zone diffusion-weighted imaging score 3 or 4 lesions in 290 patients. The rate of grade group 2 or greater cancer on biopsy for group 1, 2 and 3 lesions was 8.9%, 21% and 36.5%, respectively (p <0.03). The rate of grade group 2 or greater pathology was higher in group 2 than group 1 lesions in patients with prior negative systematic prostate biopsy (28% vs 5.0%, p <0.001) but not in those without such a biopsy (16% vs 12%, p = 0.5). Group 3 lesions had a higher rate of grade group 2 or greater cancer than group 2 lesions in the biopsy naïve subgroup (46% vs 16%, p = 0.001). However, the rates were similar in patients with prior negative systematic prostate biopsy (27% vs 28%, p = 0.9).  Conclusions:   Diffusion-weighted imaging score 3 peripheral zone lesions were more likely to be clinically significant cancer (grade group 2 or greater) if they were dynamic contrast enhanced T1-weighted imaging positive.

Materials and methods:   Men with biopsy Gleason sum 8-10 prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy were evaluated. The cohort was divided into men with Gleason 4 + 4 vs those with any pattern 5 (ie Gleason 3 + 5, 5 + 3, 4 + 5, 5 + 4 or 5 + 5).

We found that two recurrent Treg cell clones, one prevalent in prostate tumors and the other associated with prostatic autoimmune lesions, recognized distinct non-overlapping MHC-class-II-restricted peptides derived from the same prostate-specific protein. Notably, this protein is frequently targeted by autoantibodies in experimental models of prostatic autoimmunity.

Our aim was to compare cancer incidence in the cohort (overall, by sex, and by work on farm, occupational status and pesticide use) within the general population.  Methods:   More than 180,000 participants in the AGRICAN cohort were matched to cancer registries to identify cancer cases diagnosed from enrolment (2005-2007) to 31st December 2011. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs).  Results:   Over the period, 11,067 incident cancer cases were identified (7304 men and 3763 women). Overall cancer incidence did not differ between the cohort and the general population. Moreover, SIRs were significantly higher for prostate cancer (SIR=1.07, 95%CI 1.03-1.11) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR=1.09, 95%CI 1.01-1.18) among men, skin melanoma among women (SIR=1.23, 95%CI 1.05-1.43) and multiple myeloma (men: SIR=1.38, 95%CI 1.18-1.62; women: SIR=1.26, 95%CI 1.02-1.54). In contrast, SIRs were lower for upper aerodigestive tract and respiratory cancers. Increase in risk was greater in male farm workers for prostate and lip cancer, in female farm workers for skin melanoma, and in male farm owners for multiple myeloma. Moreover, incidence of multiple myeloma and skin melanoma was higher among male and female pesticide users respectively.

We investigated whether the antimalarial drug artemisinin, which is a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the sweet wormwood plant Artemisia annua, could alter AR expression and responsiveness in cultured human prostate cancer cell lines. Artemisinin treatment induced the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of the receptor protein, without altering AR transcript levels, in androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cells or PC-3 prostate cancer cells expressing exogenous wild-type AR. Furthermore, artemisinin stimulated AR ubiquitination and AR receptor interactions with the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 in LNCaP cells. The artemisinin-induced loss of AR protein prevented androgen-responsive cell proliferation and ablated total AR transcriptional activity. The serine/threonine protein kinase AKT-1 was shown to be highly associated with artemisinin-induced proteasome-mediated degradation of AR protein. Artemisinin treatment activated AKT-1 enzymatic activity, enhanced receptor association with AKT-1, and induced AR serine phosphorylation. Treatment of LNCaP cells with the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, which inhibits the PI3-kinase-dependent activation of AKT-1, prevented the artemisinin-induced AR degradation. Furthermore, in transfected receptor-negative PC-3 cells, artemisinin failed to stimulate the degradation of an altered receptor protein (S215A/S792A) with mutations in its two consensus AKT-1 serine phosphorylation sites. Taken together, our results indicate that artemisinin induces the degradation of AR protein and disrupts androgen responsiveness of human prostate cancer cells, suggesting that this natural compound represents a new potential therapeutic molecule that selectively targets AR levels.""","""['Andrea M Steely', 'Jamin A Willoughby Sr', 'Shyam N Sundar', 'Vasiliki I Aivaliotis', 'Gary L Firestone']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Isosilybin B causes androgen receptor degradation in human prostate carcinoma cells via PI3K-Akt-Mdm2-mediated pathway.', 'Interleukin-4 enhances prostate-specific antigen expression by activation of the androgen receptor and Akt pathway.', 'Complex impacts of PI3K/AKT inhibitors to androgen receptor gene expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Artemisia Extracts and Artemisinin-Based Antimalarials for COVID-19 Management: Could These Be Effective Antivirals for COVID-19 Treatment?', 'The Antimalaria Drug Artesunate Inhibits Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Replication by Activating AMPK and Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathways.', 'Bruceantin targets HSP90 to overcome resistance to hormone therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Development of Potential Antitumor Agents from the Scaffolds of Plant-Derived Terpenoid Lactones.', 'Potential applications of artemisinins in ocular diseases.']"""

The survey was digitally submitted to the 991 members between the end of January and the beginning of April 2016.  Methods:   A 19-item questionnaire was designed focusing on advantages and disadvantages of hadrontherapy, current status and possible future improvements, and need and opportunities for future investments in Italy and abroad. Information about professional qualifications, main fields of clinical involvement and specific competencies of the respondents was also collected.  Results:   The survey was completed by 121 AIFM members (response rate 12.2%). In the answers collected, it was shown that medical physicists expressed interest in hadrontherapy mainly for reasons of personal interest rather than for professional needs (90% ± 2.5% vs. 52% ± 4.3% of the respondents, respectively), with a good knowledge of the related basic aspects as well as of the pros and cons of its application. However, poor knowledge of the current status of hadrontherapy was observed among the medical physicists not directly involved at a professional level, who were less than 3% of the physicists working in radiotherapy.  Conclusions:   In light of these results, the implementation of new training and education initiatives should be devised to promote a deeper and global knowledge of hadrontherapy-related issues, not only from a theoretical point of view but also in practical terms.

However, the mechanisms through which UPEC promotes PCa development and progression are unclear. Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) is one of the most important UPEC toxins and its role in PCa progression has never been studied. We found that UPEC-secreted CNF1 promoted the migration and invasion of PCa cells and PCa metastasis. In vitro studies showed that CNF1 promotes pro-migratory and pro-invasive activity through entering PCa cells and activating Cdc42, which subsequently induced PAK1 phosphorylation and up-regulation of MMP-9 expression. CNF1 also promoted pulmonary metastasis in a xenograft mouse model through these mechanisms. PAK1 phosphorylation correlated with advanced grades of PCa in human clinical PCa tissues. These results suggest that CNF1 derived from UPEC plays an important role in PCa progression through activating a Cdc42-PAK1 signal axis and up-regulating the expression of MMP-9. Therefore, surveillance for and treatment of cnf1-carrying UPEC strains may diminish PCa progression and thus have an important clinical therapeutic impact.

In this study, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate pieces from patients with localized PCa, which included tumoral and nontumoral adjacent regions (n = 45), fresh biopsies from patients with high-risk PCa (n = 52), and healthy fresh prostates from cystoprostatectomies (n = 14) were examined. In addition, PCa cell lines and xenograft models were used to determine the presence and functional role of sst5TMD4. Results demonstrated that sst5TMD4 is overexpressed (mRNA/protein) in PCa samples, and this is especially drastic in metastatic and/or high Gleason score tumor samples. Remarkably, sst5TMD4 expression was associated with an altered frequency of 2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms: rs197055 and rs12599155. In addition, PCa cell lines and xenograft models were used to demonstrate that sst5TMD4 overexpression increases cell proliferation and migration in PCa cells and induces larger tumors in nude mice, whereas its silencing decreased proliferation and migration.

In the present study, a differential cytotoxicity screen of hormone-resistant prostate cancer LNCaP-hr cells and the parental LNCaP-FGC cells against normal MRC5 fibroblast cells, identified a small molecule compound, Aristeromycin (a derivative of 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNeP)). The molecular target was shown to be S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY), which catalyzes reversible hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) to adenosine and L-homocysteine. DZNeP and Aristeromycin showed high inhibitory activity against AHCY. Treatment of the prostate cancer cells with DZNeP led to SAH accumulation and decreased levels of homocysteine and histone H3K27 methylation. SAH accumulation and cell growth inhibition were confirmed after siRNA-mediated AHCY knockdown. To further understand why AHCY inhibitors decreased prostate cancer cell growth, we performed microRNA expression profiling with LNCaP-hr cells. Mir-26a, which is involved in regulation of EZH2 expression, was upregulated in Aristeromycin-treated LNCaP-hr cells. A reporter assay established with the EZH2 3'-UTR confirmed that transfection of microRNA precursor molecules for miR-26a decreased the EZH2 3'-UTR luciferase activity. Meanwhile, an antisense microRNA inhibitor for miR-26a recovered the luciferase activity. The present findings suggest, at least in part, that miR-26a induced by an AHCY inhibitor can regulate oncogenic EZH2 expression, and could thus be an important mechanism of action for AHCY inhibitors in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Noriko Uchiyama', 'Yukiya Tanaka', 'Tomohiro Kawamoto']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['Acquired resistance to DZNep-mediated apoptosis is associated with copy number gains of AHCY in a B-cell lymphoma model.', 'MiR-26a and miR-138 block the G1/S transition by targeting the cell cycle regulating network in prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-101 negatively regulates Ezh2 and its expression is modulated by androgen receptor and HIF-1alpha/HIF-1beta.', 'MicroRNA-26a and Tumor.', 'Functional and Pathological Roles of AHCY.', 'Wumei Pill Ameliorates AOM/DSS-Induced Colitis-Associated Colon Cancer through Inhibition of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress by Regulating S-Adenosylhomocysteine Hydrolase- (AHCY-) Mediated Hedgehog Signaling in Mice.', 'The long and short non-coding RNAs modulating EZH2 signaling in cancer.', 'Decoding the heterogeneous landscape in the development prostate cancer.', 'Genetic or pharmacologic blockade of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 inhibits the progression of peritoneal fibrosis.', 'A new metabolic gene signature in prostate cancer regulated by JMJD3 and EZH2.']"""

Previously, TB has been found to increase the yield of clinically significant PCa and is more likely to sample the index tumor compared with traditional 12-core extended sextant biopsies. Currently, the prognostic significance of perineural invasion (PNI) when identified on TB (PNI-TB) is unknown. We identified 95 men at 2 tertiary referral centers who underwent TB followed by radical prostatectomy between January 2014 and January 2017. Clinical, radiological, and pathological variables were retrospectively reviewed. PNI was identified on TB in 27 of 95 (28.4%) patients. On multivariable logistic regression, independent predictors of extraprostatic extension were prostate-specific antigen, TB maximum % core involvement, and PNI-TB (all P<.05). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that PNI-TB was associated with early biochemical recurrence events within 12 months after prostatectomy (log-rank P=.049).

Little is known about the physical after-effects of prostate biopsy outside randomised control trials. We investigate reports on the physical effect of prostate biopsy undertaken in men in routine practice.  Methods:   A self-completed questionnaire was given to men living in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) or Northern Ireland 4 to 6 weeks after prostate biopsy. Men were asked about whether they experienced specific physical after-effects postbiopsy (raised temperature/pain/bleeding/erectile dysfunction/urinary retention) and, if so, their severity and duration, and any associated health care uses. Binomial and ordinal logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with postbiopsy after-effects (presence/absence) and number of after-effects reported, respectively.  Results:   Postbiopsy after-effects were common with 88.1% of 335 respondents reporting at least 1 after-effect; 21% reported at least 3. The odds of increasing number of after-effects was over 2-fold in men with both intermediate (odds ratio [OR] = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.52-4.42) and high (OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.28-4.94) levels of health anxiety and for men who had had multiple previous biopsies (adjusted OR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.20-3.41). A total of 21.3% of men who experienced after-effects reported that they were worse than expected, 11.5% with after-effects reported contacting their doctor or local pharmacy, 14.6% contacted hospital services, and 3.1% of men with after-effects were admitted to hospital with an average stay of 5.4 nights (standard deviation = 6.3).

Pseudohyperplastic adenocarcinoma can be confused with benign lesions because of its well-differentiated appearance and has not been studied when the biopsy shows few malignant glands (limited carcinoma).  Methods:   We reviewed 94 pseudohyperplastic adenocarcinomas diagnosed in prostatic biopsies for a period of 12 years and selected those measuring less than 1 mm or involving less than 5% of the biopsied tissue. We also reviewed 200 consecutive consultations.  Results:   Four (4.2%) of the 94 cases were limited pseudohyperplastic adenocarcinomas, and 3 were from consultations. Three of them were mistaken for hyperplastic nodules, prostatic adenosis, or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm. The number of glands varied between 6 and 50 (average 23). Three nodular histological patterns were identified-nodular, adenosis-like, and pseudohyperplastic carcinoma resembling prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was not related to the number of neoplastic glands. Histological criteria that were useful included: crowded medium to large glands, papillary infoldings, branching glands, straight luminal borders, hyperchromatic nuclei, nucleomegaly, and apparent nucleoli. Areas of transition to conventional acinar adenocarcinoma were useful in recognizing four of these neoplasms, but were barely apparent in 2 of them. Hyperchromatic nuclei were found in all cases, whereas apparent nucleoli and nucleomegaly were only present in 4.  Conclusions:   The architectural and cytological criteria for limited acinar adenocarcinoma are only partially useful in interpreting minimum pseudohyperplastic adenocarcinomas.

Recent findings established that this steroidal drug exhibits potent apoptotic responses in prostate tumors in vitro and in vivo, by affecting key signaling orchestrating proliferation and apoptosis, such as c-Myc and caspase 3, Rho GTPases and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. In the present study we examined whether istaroxime is affecting cell motility and analyzed the underlying mechanism in prostate tumor cells.  Methods:   Migration was assessed by transwell and wound healing assays, Orai1 and Stim1 abundance by RT-PCR and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, Fura-2 fluorescence was utilized to determine intracellular Ca2+ and Western blotting for FAK/pFAK measurements.  Results:   We observed strong inhibition of cell migration in istaroxime treated DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Istaroxime further decreased Orai1 and Stim1 transcript levels and downregulated Orai1 protein expression. Moreover, SOCE was significantly decreased upon istaroxime treatment. Furthermore, istaroxime strikingly diminished phosphorylated FAK levels. Interestingly, the efficacy of istaroxime on the inhibition of DU-145 cell migration was further enhanced by blocking Orai1 with 2-APB and FAK with the specific inhibitor PF-00562271. These results provide strong evidence that istaroxime prevents cell migration and motility of DU-145 prostate tumor cells, an effect at least partially attributed to Orai1 downregulation and FAK de-activation.

It is therefore of increasing importance for imaging specialists to recognize potential pitfalls of this novel imaging technique. In this report, we describe a series of benign elastofibroma dorsi with uptake of the PSMA-targeted PET radiotracer F-DCFPyL.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the imaging data of 75 men with PCa who were consecutively imaged with F-DCFPyL PET/CT. Acquired images were reviewed for the presence of radiotracer uptake in the region of the scapular tip adjacent to the chest wall. Only those lesions with discrete radiotracer uptake corresponding to an area on CT with the characteristic appearance of an elastofibroma were considered positive.  Results:   In total, 18/75 (24.0%) patients had evidence of at least one elastofibroma dorsi on F-DCFPyL PET/CT. Eight (44.4%) of these patients had unilateral lesions, all of which were right sided. Detected lesions had a median maximal diameter of 2.3 cm (range: 1.3-8.4 cm) and a median perpendicular thickness to the chest wall of 0.9 cm (range: 0.6-2.5 cm). The median maximum standardized uptake value of detected lesions was 1.4 (range: 1.1-2.4) and the median maximum standardized uptake value corrected to lean body mass was 1.1 (range: 0.8-1.7).

Difficulties presented by untreated urine include varying salt concentrations, and pH levels that may be different even though they are from the same patient. Untreated urine also presents interference from other biomolecules and possesses a fewer number of cancer biomarkers than can be found in serum. As a result, urine preconditioning processes and digital rectal examination (DRE) to increase biomarker secretion are mandatory in current urine assays. To address these challenges, an ion-responsive urine sensor (IRUS) that measures differential electrical signals is proposed as a self-normalized detection method. The proposed IRUS is based on a FET biosensor with a disposable sensing gate and has the capability to detect the prostate cancer antigen ANXA3 in untreated patient urine.

Using additional filters, we selected 12 and 1 miRNA more released by all 22Rv1/DCTR and DU-145/DCTR clones, respectively. Moreover, we showed that 6 of them were more represented in the growth medium of the DCTR cells than the ones of DCT-treated cells.

This study used population attributable fractions (PAFs) to estimate the cancer burden attributable to excess body weight in Canadian adults (aged 25+ years) in 2010.  Methods:   We estimated PAFs using relative risk (RR) estimates from the World Cancer Research Fund International Continuous Update Project, BMI-based estimates of overweight (25.00 kg/m2-29.99 kg/m2) and obesity (30.00+ kg/m2) from the 2000-2001 Canadian Community Health Survey, and cancer case counts from the Canadian Cancer Registry. PAFs were based on BMI corrected for the bias in self-reported height and weight.  Results:   In Canada in 2010, an estimated 9645 cancer cases were attributable to excess body weight, representing 5.7% of all cancer cases (males 4.9%, females 6.5%). When limiting the analysis to types of cancer associated with high BMI, the PAF increased to 14.9% (males 17.5%, females 13.3%). Types of cancer with the highest PAFs were esophageal adenocarcinoma (42.2%), kidney (25.4%), gastric cardia (20.7%), liver (20.5%), colon (20.5%) and gallbladder (20.2%) for males, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (36.1%), uterus (35.2%), gallbladder (23.7%) and kidney (23.0%) for females. Types of cancer with the greatest number of attributable cases were colon (1445), kidney (780) and advanced prostate (515) for males, and uterus (1825), postmenopausal breast (1765) and colon (675) for females. Irrespective of sex or type of cancer, PAFs were highest in the Prairies (except Alberta) and the Atlantic region and lowest in British Columbia and Quebec.

First, 3D DNA walking machine with higher efficiency of payload releasing and superior signal amplification than those of the traditional DNA walking machine was initially introduced in the ECL system for converting target microRNA to intermediate DNA and achieving significant signal amplification. Second, the distance between CdS:Mn quantum dots and Au nanoparticles was increased with the hybridization of intermediate DNA and Au nanoparticles modified S2, which weakened the energy transfer for ECL signal recovering and excited the surface plasma resonance for further enhancing the signal to construct the on-off-super on biosensor. Such an on-off-super on strategy not only reduced the ECL background signal but also increased the detection sensitivity. Impressively, the elaborately designed biosensor could be regenerated by Lambda exonuclease hydrolyzing the intermediate DNA to make Au nanoparticles modified S2 recover to their original hairpin structure. With the amazing signal amplification of 3D DNA walking machine and sensitive distance control of the on-off-super on strategy, the biosensor showed excellent performance for microRNA-141 detection with a low detection limit of 3.3 fM and could be applied to human prostate cancer cells analysis. Furthermore, this work established a foundation to apply 3D walker in ECL methodology and provided an effective way for analysis of other microRNA or cancer cells.""","""['Ziqi Xu', 'Linli Liao', 'Yaqin Chai', 'Haijun Wang', 'Ruo Yuan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Bi-directional DNA Walking Machine and Its Application in an Enzyme-Free Electrochemiluminescence Biosensor for Sensitive Detection of MicroRNAs.', 'Construction of a Cytosine-Adjusted Electrochemiluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer System for MicroRNA Detection.', 'Target-Induced 3D DNA Network Structure as a Novel Signal Amplifier for Ultrasensitive Electrochemiluminescence Detection of MicroRNAs.', 'Recent advances of ratiometric electrochemiluminescence biosensors.', 'Strategies for Enhancing the Sensitivity of Electrochemiluminescence Biosensors.', 'Electrochemiluminescence of Semiconductor Quantum Dots and Its Biosensing Applications: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Nucleic acid nanoassembly-enhanced RNA therapeutics and diagnosis.', 'Dual-mode sensor based on the synergy of magnetic separation and functionalized probes for the ultrasensitive detection of Clostridium perfringens.', 'A smart fluorescent biosensor for the highly sensitive detection of BRCA1 based on a 3D DNA walker and ESDR cascade amplification.', 'Novel Ti3C2Tx MXene nanozyme with manageable catalytic activity and application to electrochemical biosensor.']"""

Methods:   Online daily replanning for a 35-fraction treatment for five prostate cases is simulated while accounting for anatomical transformations derived from fiducial marker data available in our clinic. Two online replanning strategies were simulated, compensating for: (a) rotation-only in combination with a couch shift and (b) both translation and rotation without a couch shift. They were compared against our current clinical protocol consisting of a single offline plan used over all fractions with daily couch repositioning (translations only). For every patient, the above methods were generated for several planning margins (0-8 mm with 2 mm increments) in order to assess the performance of online replanning in terms of target coverage and investigate the possible dosimetric benefit for the organs at risk. The daily DVHs for each treatment strategy were used for evaluation and the non tumor integral dose (NTID) for the different margins was calculated in order to quantify the overall reduction of the delivered energy to the patient.  Results:   Our system is able to generate a daily automated prostate plan in less than 2 min. For every patient, the daily treatment plans produce similar dose distributions to the original approved plan (average CTV D99 relative difference: 0.2%). The inclusion of both shifts and rotations can be effectively compensated via replanning among all planning margins (average CTV D99 difference: 0.01 Gy between the two replanning regimes). Online replanning is able to maintain target coverage among all margins, while - as expected - the conventional treatment plan is increasingly affected by the interfraction rotations as the margins shrink (average CTV D99 decrease: 0.2 Gy at 8 mm to 2.9 Gy at 0 mm margin). The possible gain in total delivered energy to the patient was quantified by the decreased NTID ranging from 12.6% at 6 mm to 32.9% at 0 mm.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate that fast daily replanning can be utilized to account for daily rotations and translations based on the daily positioning protocol. A daily plan can be generated from scratch in less than 2 min making it suitable for online application. Given the large magnitude of prostate rotation around the LR axis, online correction for daily rotations can be beneficial even for the clinical 8 mm margin and could be utilized for treatments with small margin reduction mainly limited then by anatomical deformations and intrafraction motion. Our online replanning pipeline can be used in future treatments with online MR guidance that can lead to further safe reduction of the planning margins.""","""['Charis Kontaxis', 'Gijsbert H Bol', 'Linda G W Kerkmeijer', 'Jan J W Lagendijk', 'Bas W Raaymakers']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A hybrid strategy of offline adaptive planning and online image guidance for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Role of image-guided patient repositioning and online planning in localized prostate cancer IMRT.', 'Comparison of online IGRT techniques for prostate IMRT treatment: adaptive vs repositioning correction.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Target margins in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Optimizing 3DCT image registration for interfractional changes in carbon-ion prostate radiotherapy.', 'Daily online contouring and re-planning versus translation-only correction in neurovascular-sparing magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Clinical utility of a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging-guided linear accelerator during conventionally fractionated and hypofractionated prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Implementation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Radiation Therapy in Routine Care: Opportunities and Challenges in the United States.', 'Clinical implementation and feasibility of long-course fractionated MR-guided chemoradiotherapy for patients with esophageal cancer: An R-IDEAL stage 1b/2a evaluation of technical innovation.']"""

Methods:   We measured hsCRP before and during infection for 299 chlamydia, 112 gonorrhea, and 59 non-chlamydial, non-gonococcal urethritis (NCNGU) cases; before and after infection for 55 infectious mononucleosis (IM) and 90 other systemic/non-genitourinary cases; and for 220-256 controls.  Results:   Only gonorrhea cases were significantly more likely to have a large hsCRP rise (≥1.40 mg/L or ≥239%) during infection than controls (P < 0.01). However, gonorrhea, IM, and other systemic/non-genitourinary cases were more likely to have a rise of any magnitude up to one year post-diagnosis than controls (p = 0.038-0.077).  Conclusions:   These findings, which differ from those for PSA, suggest distinct mechanisms of elevation for hsCRP and PSA, and support both direct (eg, prostate infection) and indirect (eg, systemic inflammation-mediated prostate cell damage) mechanisms for PSA elevation.

This decision was made partly with model-based analyses from cancer intervention and surveillance modeling network (CISNET), which assumed perfect compliance to screening.  Methods:   As part of CISNET, we developed a microsimulation model for lung cancer (LC) screening and calibrated and validated it using data from NLST and the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial (PLCO), respectively. We evaluated population-level outcomes of the lifetime screening program recommended by the USPSTF by varying screening compliance levels.  Results:   Validation using PLCO shows that our model reproduces observed PLCO outcomes, predicting 884 LC cases [Expected(E)/Observed(O) = 0.99; CI 0.92-1.06] and 563 LC deaths (E/O = 0.94 CI 0.87-1.03) in the screening arm that has an average compliance rate of 87.9% over four annual screening rounds. We predict that perfect compliance to the USPSTF recommendation saves 501 LC deaths per 100,000 persons in the 1950 U.S. birth cohort; however, assuming that compliance behaviors extrapolated and varied from PLCO reduces the number of LC deaths avoided to 258, 230, and 175 as the average compliance rate over 26 annual screening rounds changes from 100 to 46, 39, and 29%, respectively.  Conclusion:   The implementation of the USPSTF recommendation is expected to contribute to a reduction in LC deaths, but the magnitude of the reduction will likely be heavily influenced by screening compliance.""","""['Summer S Han', 'S Ayca Erdogan', 'Iakovos Toumazis', 'Ann Leung', 'Sylvia K Plevritis']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Lung Cancer Screening in the United States: A Comparative Modeling Study.', 'Development and Validation of Risk Models to Select Ever-Smokers for CT Lung Cancer Screening.', 'Evaluation of the Benefits and Harms of Lung Cancer Screening With Low-Dose Computed Tomography: Modeling Study for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Evaluation of the Benefits and Harms of Lung Cancer Screening With Low-Dose Computed Tomography: A Collaborative Modeling Study for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for lung cancer screening.', 'A predictive model for lung cancer screening nonadherence in a community setting health-care network.', 'Receipt of Recommended Follow-up Care After a Positive Lung Cancer Screening Examination.', 'Uptake of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography in China: A multi-centre population-based study.', 'Effect of Refined Perioperative Nursing on the Efficacy of Noninvasive Ventilation in Elderly Patients with Lung Cancer and Respiratory Failure.', 'A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Lung Cancer Screening With Low-Dose Computed Tomography and a Diagnostic Biomarker.']"""

We previously identified the cancer-associated cell migration protein Tetraspanin 1 (TSPAN1) as a clinically relevant androgen regulated target in prostate cancer. Here we find that TSPAN1 is acutely induced by androgens, and is significantly upregulated in prostate cancer relative to both normal prostate tissue and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). We also show for the first time, that TSPAN1 expression in prostate cancer cells controls the expression of key proteins involved in cell migration.

We reviewed the progressive status and survival of 382 prostate cancer patients who had received hormone therapy at our institutions. Survival of clinicopathological variables analyzed as categorical variables were determined by the log-rank test. According to Cox's proportional hazards analysis, R2D:4D, L2D:4D, PSA at 6 month,bone metastasis were significant independent factors for prostate cancer. The risk of any progression of prostate cancer similarly depressed with increasing 2D:4D, for any progression (R2D:4D HR = 0.71, p = 0.003; L2D:4D HR = 0.67, p = 0.001), for cancer-specific death (R2D:4D HR = 0.67, p = 0.025; L2D:4D HR = 0.74, p = 0.036).

Recently, several studies found unexpected PSMA radiotracer uptake by thyroid tumors, including radioiodine-refractory (RAIR) cancers. PSMA expression was reported in tumor-associated endothelium of various malignancies, however it has not been systematically addressed in thyroid tumors. We found that PSMA was frequently expressed in microvessels of thyroid tumors (120/267), but not in benign thyroid tissue. PSMA expression in neovasculature was highly irregular ranging from 19% in benign tumors to over 50% in thyroid cancer. Such heterogeneity was not directly attributed to endothelial cell proliferation as confirmed by immunostaining with proliferation-associated endothelial marker CD105. PSMA expression was associated with tumor size (p = 0.02) and vascular invasion in follicular carcinoma (p = 0.03), but not with other baseline histological, and clinical parameters. Significant translational implication is that RAIR tumors and high-grade cancers maintain high level of PSMA expression, and can be targeted by PSMA ligand radiopharmaceuticals.

Quantitative studies on the stigmatization of cancer patients are scarce. The present study assessed the stigma of cancer patients in relation to their status of employment, and analyzes sociodemographic, disease and occupational predictors. Methods In a bicentric study, 858 patients with breast, bowel, lung or prostate cancer were included. Of these, n=305 were employed and entered into the analyses (age average 55 years, 43% female, 47% breast cancer). As a comparison group, a matched sample of non-employed persons (n=213) is used from our data set. In addition to questions on work and health aspects, stigmatization was measured using the SIS-D (Social Impact Scale). The data are evaluated uni- and multivariable. Results Employed persons with prostate or breast cancer are less stigmatized (p<0.01) than non-employed persons, with effects between d=0.35-0.97. The strongest influence on perceived stigma is the lack of support from the employer, further predictors are poor health, low mental workability and diagnosis of breast cancer (R2 of the final model=0.35). Conclusion The employment of cancer patients is associated with lesser perceived stigmatization.

Materials and methods:   Fifty-six consecutive patients fulfilling the following criteria were included in this IRB-approved prospective study: elevated PSA levels or suspicious findings at digital rectal examination or TRUS; and histopathological verification. All patients underwent MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI of the prostate performed on separate scanners with PET/CT using [11C]Acetate and 3T MP MR imaging. Appropriate statistical tests were used to determine diagnostic accuracy, local and distant staging.  Results:   MP imaging with two MRI parameters (T2w and DWI) achieved the highest sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 95%, 68.8%, and 88%, with an AUC of 0.82 for primary PCa detection. Neither assessments with a single parameter (AUC, 0.54-0.79), nor different combinations with up to five parameters (AUC, 0.67-0.79) achieved equally good results. MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI improved local staging with a sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 100%, 96%, and 97% compared to MRI alone with 72.2%, 100%, and 95.5%. MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI correctly detected osseous and liver metastases in five patients.  Conclusions:   MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI merges morphologic with functional information, and allows insights into tumor biology. MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI with two MRI-derived parameters (T2 and DWI) yields the highest diagnostic accuracy. The addition of more parameters does not improve diagnostic accuracy of primary PCa detection. MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI facilitates improved local and distant staging, providing ""one-stop"" staging in patients with primary PCa, and therefore has the potential to improve therapy.  Patient summary:   In this report we investigated MP [11C]Acetate PET-MRI for detection, local and distant staging of prostate cancer.

The study included 72 cases of incident primary prostate cancer patients and 302 controls of urology clinic patients who had prostate conditions other than prostate cancer. The DII was computed based on intake of 18 nutrients assessed using a 67-item food frequency questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs).  Results:   Men with higher DII scores were at increased risk of prostate cancer using DII score fit both as a continuous [OR = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-2.38] and categorical variable [compared to men in the lowest DII quartile, men in the highest quartile were at elevated risk (OR = 3.50, 95% CI 1.25-9.80; ptrend = 0.02)]. There was no significant heterogeneity by weight status, but stronger association was observed in men with body mass index >25 kg/m2 versus <25 kg/m2.

This study was designed to evaluate the anticancer activity of HT against prostate cancer cells, and the mechanism thereof.  Methods and results:   Treatment of LNCaP and C4-2 prostate cancer cells with HT resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation. This was in contrast to HT's ineffectiveness against normal prostate epithelial cells RWPE1 and PWLE2, suggesting cancer-cell-specific effect. HT induced G1/S cell cycle arrest, with inhibition of cyclins D1/E and cdk2/4 and induction of inhibitory p21/p27. HT also induced apoptosis, as confirmed by flow cytometry, caspase activation, PARP cleavage, and BAX/Bcl-2 ratio. It inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt/STAT3, and induced cytoplasmic retention of NF-κB, which may explain its observed effects. Finally, HT inhibited androgen receptor (AR) expression and the secretion of AR-responsive prostate-specific antigen.  Conclusion:   Castration-resistant prostate cancers retain AR signaling and are often marked by activated Akt, NF-κB, and STAT3 signaling. Our results establish a pleiotropic activity of HT against these oncogenic signaling pathways.

Methods:   Diffusion-weighted images with 15 b-factors ranging from b = 0 to 3500 s/mm2 were obtained in 62 prostate cancer patients. Pixel-wise signal decay fits for each model were evaluated with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Parameter values for each model were determined within normal prostate and the index lesion. Their potential to differentiate normal from cancerous tissue was investigated through receiver operating characteristic analysis and comparison with Gleason score.  Results:   The biexponential slow diffusion fraction fslow , the apparent kurtosis diffusion coefficient ADCK , and the excess kurtosis factor K differ significantly among normal peripheral zone (PZ), normal transition zone (TZ), tumor PZ, and tumor TZ. Biexponential and gamma distribution models result in the lowest AIC, indicating a superior fit. Maximum areas under the curve (AUCs) of all models ranged from 0.93 to 0.96 for the PZ and from 0.95 to 0.97 for the TZ. Similar AUCs also result from the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of a monoexponential fit to a b-factor sub-range up to 1250 s/mm2 . For kurtosis and stretched exponential models, single parameters yield the highest AUCs, whereas for the biexponential and gamma distribution models, linear combinations of parameters produce the highest AUCs. Parameters with high AUC show a trend in differentiating low from high Gleason score, whereas parameters with low AUC show no such ability.

This study included a total of 63 consecutive Japanese mCRPC patients treated with cabazitaxel following the failure of docetaxel, and assessed the prognostic significance of cabazitaxel therapy in these patients focusing on the association of efficacies between two taxane agents. After treatment with cabazitaxel (median 5 cycles), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline was observed in 39 patients (61.9%), including 13 (27.0%) achieving the response defined by PSA decline ≥50%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) periods after the introduction of cabazitaxel were 4.1 and 14.8 months, respectively. The response rate to cabazitaxel was not significantly different between responders and non-responders to prior docetaxel, and there was no significant correlation between the PFSs with docetaxel and cabazitaxel. Furthermore, univariate analyses of several parameters identified the performance status (PS) and clinical symptoms, but not the cycles of docetaxel therapy, total amount of administered docetaxel or objective response to docetaxel therapy, as significant predictors of OS on cabazitaxel therapy, of which only PS was independently associated with OS on multivariate analysis. These findings suggest that oncological outcomes in Japanese mCRPC patients receiving cabazitaxel are generally satisfactory, irrespective of the profiles related to prior treatment with docetaxel, and that it might be preferable to introduce cabazitaxel to mCRPC patients with a good PS to maximize the prognostic benefit of this agent.""","""['Hideaki Miyake', 'Takayuki Sugiyama', 'Ryota Aki', 'Yuto Matsushita', 'Keita Tamura', 'Daisuke Motoyama', 'Toshiki Ito', 'Atsushi Otsuka']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Oncol""","""['No significant impact of patient age and prior treatment profile with docetaxel on the efficacy of cabazitaxel in patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Significance of De Ritis (Aspartate Transaminase/Alanine Transaminase) Ratio as a Significant Prognostic But Not Predictive Biomarker in Japanese Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Cabazitaxel.', 'Oncological outcome of docetaxel-based chemotherapy for Japanese men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: changing landscape with cabazitaxel.', 'Oncologic Response and Hospitalization Rate of Patients Receiving Cabazitaxel in the Fourth-Line and Beyond in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Analysis of a Retrospective Cohort and a Structured Literature Review.', 'Efficacy and safety of apalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (GENESIS): protocol for a multicentre, open-label, single-arm clinical trial.', 'Cabazitaxel versus abiraterone or enzalutamide in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: post hoc analysis of the CARD study excluding chemohormonal therapy for castrate-naive disease.', 'Prognostic value of ECOG performance status and Gleason score in the survival of castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Safety and efficacy of cabazitaxel in Japanese patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel for castration-resistant prostate cancer in patients with >\u200910 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy: a multi-institutional study.']"""

Results from nine population-based cancer registries""","""Introduction:   With the aim of providing cancer control indicators, this work presents cancer survival in adult (≥15 years) patients in Spain diagnosed during the period 2000-2007 from Spanish cancer registries participating in the EUROCARE project.  Methods:   Cancer cases from nine Spanish population-based cancer registries were included and analysed as a whole. All primary malignant neoplasms diagnosed in adult patients were eligible for the analysis. Cancer patients were followed until 31 December 2008. For each type of cancer, 1-, 3- and 5-year observed and relative survival were estimated by sex, age and years from diagnosis. Furthermore, age-standardized 5-year relative survival for the period 2000-2007 has been compared with that of the period 1995-1999.  Results:   Skin melanoma (84.6 95% CI 83.0-86.2), prostate (84.6% 95% CI 83.6-85.6) and thyroid (84.2% CI 95% 82.0-86.6) cancers showed the highest 5-year relative survival, whereas the worst prognosis was observed in pancreatic (6% 95% CI 5.1-7.0) and oesophageal (9.4% 95% CI 7.9-11.1) cancers. Overall, survival is higher in women (58.0%) than in men (48.9%). The absolute difference in relative survival between 2000-2007 and 1995-1999 was positive for all cancers as a whole (+4.8% in men, +1.6% in women) and for most types of tumours. Survival increased significantly for chronic myeloid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and rectum cancer in both sexes, and for acute lymphoid leukaemia, prostate, liver and colon cancers in men and Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast cancer in women. Survival patterns by age were similar in Europe and Spain. A decline in survival by age was observed in all tumours, being more pronounced for ovarian, corpus uteri, prostate and urinary bladder and less for head and neck and rectum cancers.  Conclusion:   High variability and differences have been observed in survival among adults in Spain according to the type of cancer diagnosed, from above 84% to below 10%, reflecting high heterogeneity. The differences in prognosis by age, sex and period of diagnosis reveal opportunities for improving cancer care in Spain.""","""['M D Chirlaque', 'D Salmerón', 'J Galceran', 'A Ameijide', 'A Mateos', 'A Torrella', 'R Jiménez', 'N Larrañaga', 'R Marcos-Gragera', 'E Ardanaz', 'M Sant', 'P Minicozzi', 'C Navarro', 'M J Sánchez;REDECAN Working Group']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Cancer survival in Spain: estimate for nine major cancers.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Epidemiology of cancer among Hispanics in the United States.', 'Population-based cancer registries in Spain and their role in cancer control.', 'Colorectal cancer: a qualitative study of coping strategies used by survivors, with associated social determinants.', 'Survival nomogram for osteosarcoma patients: SEER data retrospective analysis with external validation.', 'Impact of the ""Looking after my health after cancer"" peer-led active patient education program on cancer survivors and their caregivers: A qualitative study.', 'Sex differences in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of cancer: the rationale for an individualised approach.', 'Preoperative Omega-6/Omega-3 Fatty Acid Ratio Could Predict Postoperative Outcomes in Patients with Surgically Resected Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

However, these ratios have not been analyzed in patients treated with abiraterone acetate. We explored the relationship between different values of PLR and NLR and survival in mCPRCP treated with abiraterone and their possible relation with a prostate specific antigen (PSA) response.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 101 patients with mCRPC treated with abiraterone from January of 2012 to November of 2015 in two different hospitals. A cut-off value of 5 for NLR and 150 for PLR were used to compare survival by Kaplan-Meier method. Moreover, an association between these cut-off values and the PSA response was analyzed by a χ 2 test.  Results:   In the case of NLR, the median DFS were 12, 1 months for NLR <5 and 7 months for NLR ≥5, p = 0.061. The median OS were 23.9 months for NLR <5 and 16.3 months for NLR ≥5, p = 0.046. In the case of PLR, the median DFS were 11.8 months for PLR <150 and 10.6 months for PLR ≥150, p = 0.549. The median OS were 27.4 months for PLR <150 and 15.9 months for PLR ≥150, p = 0.005. It was not observed a correlation between the different cut-off values of PLR or NLR and a PSA response ≥25% (p = 0.31).

Performance specifications for the motion platform were derived from literature regarding the motion characteristics of prostate and lung tumor targets required for real time motion management. The performance of the programmable motion platform was evaluated against (1) maximum range, velocity and acceleration (5 DoF), (2) static position accuracy (5 DoF) and (3) dynamic position accuracy using patient-derived prostate and lung tumor motion traces (3 DoF). Translational motion accuracy was compared against electromagnetic transponder measurements. Rotation was benchmarked with a digital inclinometer. The static accuracy and reproducibility for translation and rotation was <0.1 mm or <0.1°, respectively. The accuracy of reproducing dynamic patient motion was <0.3 mm. The motion platform's range met the need to reproduce clinically relevant translation and rotation ranges and its accuracy met the TG 142 requirements for SABR.

CRPC cells still retain the functioning AR which can be targeted by other therapies. A recent promising development is the use of inhibitors (Epi-1) of protein-protein interaction to inhibit AR-activated signalling. Translating novel therapies into the clinic requires sensitive early response indicators. Here potential response markers are explored. Growth inhibition of prostate cancer cells with flutamide, paclitaxel, and Epi-1 was measured using the MTT assay. To simulate choline-PET scans, pulse-chase experiments were carried out with [3H-methyl]choline and proportion of phosphorylated activity was determined after treatment with growth inhibitory concentrations of each drug. Extracts from treated cells were also subject to 31P-NMR spectroscopy. Cells treated with flutamide demonstrated decreased [3H-methyl]choline phosphorylation, whilst the proportion of phosphorylated [3H-methyl]choline that was present in the lipid fraction was increased in Epi-1-treated cells. Phospholipid breakdown products, glycerophosphorylcholine and glycerophosphoethanolamine levels, were shown by 31P-NMR spectroscopy to be decreased to undetectable levels in cells treated with Epi-1.

We examined the effects of overexpression of MUC1 in colon cancer cells, finding that it induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), including enhanced migration and invasion, and increased Akt phosphorylation. When the clones were treated with the aspirin metabolite salicylate, Akt phosphorylation was decreased and EMT inhibited. As the salicylate motif is necessary for the activity of the lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) inhibitor anacardic acid, we hypothesized these effects were associated with the inhibition of KAT activity. This was supported by anacardic acid treatment producing the same effect on EMT. In vitro KAT assays confirmed that salicylate directly inhibited PCAF/Kat2b, Tip60/Kat5 and hMOF/Kat8, and this inhibition was likely involved in the reversal of EMT in the metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Salicylate treatment also inhibited EMT induced by cytokines, illustrating the general effect it had on this process.

Beneficiaries may receive primary care at military run facilities via the direct care system or with private physicians via the purchased care system. We compared rates of prostate specific antigen screening between propensity score weighted cohorts of 219,290 men who received primary care in the direct care system and 177,748 who received it in the purchased care system.  Results:   The screening rate was 35% in the direct care system vs 26% in the purchased care system. After propensity score weighting the former men were significantly more likely to undergo prostate specific antigen screening than men who received primary care in the purchased care system (adjusted OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.729-1.781). Age older than 52 years, rank and black race were associated with increased odds of prostate specific antigen screening in each cohort.

Here we report a new phenomenon whereby a fusion transcript functions as a long non-coding chimeric RNA (lnccRNA). This fusion RNA, SLC45A3-ELK4, generated by cis-splicing between neighboring genes, was found in prostate cancer. The fusion RNA encodes the same protein as ELK4. Intriguingly, we found that the fusion RNA level is less than 1% of wild type ELK4, unlikely to perturb the general pool of ELK4 protein. Nonetheless, when the fusion RNA, but not ELK4 is silenced, cell proliferation is inhibited in both androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. This growth arrest can be rescued by exogenous expression of the fusion and a mutant designed to prevent translation of the ELK4 protein. In the same setting, the mutant could also suppress CDKN1A and several other targets of SLC45A3-ELK4. In addition, similar to many long non-coding RNAs, the fusion RNA is enriched in the nuclear fraction.

This enzyme has been validated as a target for anticancer agent screening. It can be poisoned by common chemotherapeutics, such as etoposide and doxorubicin, which leads to the accumulation of cytotoxic enzyme-linked DNA double-stranded breaks. However, recent studies have suggested that the topoisomerase 2a isozyme is predominantly responsible for the carcinogenic side effects associated with etoposide and doxorubicin chemotherapy. Thus, we need to find a promising topoisomerase 2-targeting anticancer agent that avoids these carcinogenic side effects. Recent studies have found that cryptotanshinone has obvious anticancer activities against diverse cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that cryptotanshinone markedly decreases the steady-state mRNA level of topoisomerase 2a, thereby decreasing the protein and activity levels of this enzyme.

The primary function of M2 macrophages is to facilitate wound healing. As such, they are capable of providing metabolic support to a growing tumor, neovascularization, as well as protection from cytotoxic T cells. The tumor microenvironment contains a milieu of secreted factors and vesicles, which in certain circumstances can gain access to lymphatic vessels that drain to local lymph nodes.  Case presentation:   We report a 59-year-old male with recurrent T4 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx with synchronous prostate adenocarcinoma confined to the prostate and regional pelvic lymph nodes, without metastatic disease. The patient underwent salvage total laryngectomy and bilateral neck dissection with final pathology revealing a recurrent moderately differentiated SCC involving the larynx as well as prostate cancer in draining level 4 cervical lymph nodes bilaterally. CD163 staining was performed on the primary tumor, a negative draining lymph node, and a level four lymph node with a focus of metastatic prostate cancer and compared to benign controls. The negative draining lymph node demonstrated a large CD163 population of cells as did the interface of the focus of prostate cancer and surrounding lymph node. CD163 levels were markedly increased in this patient compared to benign lymph node controls. The macrophage differentiation at the primary tumor in the larynx was strongly CD163 positive supporting an immune permissive environment for tumor growth and metastasis.  Conclusion:   We describe a unique case of solitary metastatic prostate cancer to cervical lymph nodes in the setting of a laryngeal cancer. These observations suggest that SCC-derived factors drive a tumor-supportive environment in draining lymph nodes dominated by an overwhelming number of CD163+, M2 macrophages. Lymph nodes that are 'primed' by SCC differentiation to M2 phenotype may be at higher risk of harboring metastases.""","""['Michael C Topf', 'Madalina Tuluc', 'Larry A Harshyne', 'Adam Luginbuhl']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Level IIb lymph node metastasis in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'The clinical analysis of cervical lymph node metastases from squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and hypopharynx treated with total laryngectomy.', 'Frequency of metastases at the area of the supraretrospinal (level IIB) lymph node in laryngeal cancer.', 'Incidental metastases of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma in lymph nodes of patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer: eight cases with a review of the literature.', 'Primary combined small cell carcinoma of larynx with lateralized histologic components and corresponding side-specific neck nodal metastasis: report of a unique case and review of literature.', 'Multi-lectin Affinity Chromatography and Quantitative Proteomic Analysis Reveal Differential Glycoform Levels between Prostate Cancer and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Sera.']"""

Hence many efforts are underway to identify treatment predictive biomarkers. We have reported the results of two phase I trials using a DNA vaccine encoding prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. In both trials, persistent PAP-specific Th1 immunity developed in some patients, and this was associated with favorable changes in serum PSA kinetics. In the current study, we sought to determine if measures of antigen-specific or antigen non-specific immunity were present prior to treatment, and associated with subsequent immune response, to identify possible predictive immune biomarkers.  Methods:   Patients who developed persistent PAP-specific, IFNγ-secreting immune responses were defined as immune ""responders."" The frequency of peripheral T cell and B cell lymphocytes, natural killer cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells, and regulatory T cells were assessed by flow cytometry and clinical laboratory values. PAP-specific immune responses were evaluated by cytokine secretion in vitro, and by antigen-specific suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity to a recall antigen in an in vivo SCID mouse model.  Results:   The frequency of peripheral blood cell types did not differ between the immune responder and non-responder groups. Non-responder patients tended to have higher PAP-specific IL-10 production pre-vaccination (p = 0.09). Responder patients had greater preexisting PAP-specific bystander regulatory responses that suppressed DTH to a recall antigen (p = 0.016).  Conclusions:   While our study population was small (n = 38), these results suggest that different measures of antigen-specific tolerance or regulation might help predict immunological outcome from DNA vaccination.

However the difficulty to perform inference in nonlinear models and to calculate the distribution of individual parameters has long limited this approach to linear mixed-effect models for the longitudinal part. Here we use a Bayesian algorithm and a nonlinear joint model to calculate individual dynamic predictions. We apply this approach to predict the risk of death in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with frequent Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) measurements.  Methods:   A joint model is built using a large population of 400 mCRPC patients where PSA kinetics is described by a biexponential function and the hazard function is a PSA-dependent function. Using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm implemented in Stan software and the estimated population parameters in this population as priors, the a posteriori distribution of the hazard function is computed for a new patient knowing his PSA measurements until a given landmark time. Time-dependent area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Brier score are derived to assess discrimination and calibration of the model predictions, first on 200 simulated patients and then on 196 real patients that are not included to build the model.  Results:   Satisfying coverage probabilities of Monte Carlo prediction intervals are obtained for longitudinal and hazard functions. Individual dynamic predictions provide good predictive performances for landmark times larger than 12 months and horizon time of up to 18 months for both simulated and real data.

Despite controversy, recent clinical guidelines state surveillance may be considered for men with low-volume intermediate-risk (LVIR) disease.  Objective:   To compare rates of adverse pathologic findings among VLR, LR, and LVIR men electing immediate radical prostatectomy and evaluate criteria to define if a favorable intermediate-risk group minimizing risk exists.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a cohort study of men (2005-July 2016) with clinically localized VLR (1264 patients), LR (4849 patients), and LVIR (608 patients) (1-2 cores, Gleason 3 + 4 = 7, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level <20 ng/mL) prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy evaluated retrospectively at Johns Hopkins Hospital.  Interventions:   Radical prostatectomy.  Main outcomes and measures:   The proportions of men found to have at least Gleason 4 + 3 = 7 disease and other adverse pathologic features were compared by risk group. Log-binomial regression calculated relative risk (RR) of adverse pathologic findings in the LVIR cohort compared with VLR and LR cohorts. Analyses were repeated in subgroups of the LVIR population who otherwise met criteria for VLR (T1c, PSA density [PSAD] <0.15 ng/mL/cm3, ≤50% cancer in any core) and LR (≤T2a, PSA level <10 ng/mL) disease. Rates of adverse pathologic findings within the LVIR group were calculated based on various clinical thresholds, and univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of adverse pathologic findings.  Results:   The rate of adverse pathologic findings was significantly higher for LVIR disease (150 of 608 patients [24.7%]; RR, 4.50; 95% CI, 3.73-5.43; P < .001) compared with LR disease (280 of 4849 [5.8%]), and LVIR disease (RR, 5.14; 95% CI, 3.84-6.89; P < .001) compared with men with VLR disease (60 of 1264 [4.7%]). Restriction of LVIR men to additional criteria did not significantly affect results. There were no preoperative clinical or pathologic criteria that could identify a subgroup of the LVIR population with rates of adverse pathologic findings comparable with those of the VLR and LR cohorts. PSAD was a significant predictor of adverse pathologic findings, but Gleason score had the largest effect (odds ratio, 4.30 (95% CI, 3.40-5.44; P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   Nearly 25% of men (150 of 608) electing immediate radical prostatectomy with low-volume, Gleason 3 + 4 prostate cancer on biopsy are found to harbor adverse surgical pathologic findings. These data do not support the presence of a ""favorable"" subgroup among included patients and could have important implications for active surveillance in similar patients with Gleason 3 + 4 = 7 prostate cancer.""","""['Hiten D Patel', 'Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Re: Adverse Pathologic Findings for Men Electing Immediate Radical Prostatectomy: Defining a Favorable Intermediate-Risk Group.', 'Stratifying Risk for Men With Low-Volume Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Stratifying Risk for Men With Low-Volume Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer-Reply.', 'Pathologic Outcomes in Favorable-risk Prostate Cancer: Comparative Analysis of Men Electing Active Surveillance and Immediate Surgery.', 'Pathological outcomes in men with low risk and very low risk prostate cancer: implications on the practice of active surveillance.', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network® Favorable Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer-Is Active Surveillance Appropriate?', 'Risk of adverse pathology at prostatectomy in the era of MRI and targeted biopsies; rethinking active surveillance for intermediate risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Radical prostatectomy for impalpable prostate cancer: the Johns Hopkins experience with tumors found on transurethral resection (stages T1A and T1B) and on needle biopsy (stage T1C).', 'A modeling study to estimate prostate cancer-specific mortality on active surveillance for men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer: Results from the SEARCH cohort.', 'The highest percentage of Gleason Pattern 4 is a predictor in intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'High-throughput precision MRI assessment with integrated stack-ensemble deep learning can enhance the preoperative prediction of prostate cancer Gleason grade.', 'Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Current Data.', 'The Impact of the Ongoing COVID-19 Epidemic on the Increasing Risk of Adverse Pathology in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Addressing cells in different tumor compartments requires drug carriers, which are not only able to accumulate via the EPR effect but also to extravasate, target specific cell populations, and get internalized by cells. Reasoning that antibodies are among the most efficient targeting systems developed by nature, we consider their size (∼10-15 nm) to be ideal for balancing passive and active tumor targeting. Therefore, small, short-circulating (10 kDa, ∼7 nm, t1/2 ∼ 1 h) and larger, longer-circulating (40 kDa, ∼13 nm, t1/2 ∼ 13 h) riboflavin-targeted branched PEG polymers were synthesized, and their biodistribution and target site accumulation were evaluated in mice bearing angiogenic squamous cell carcinoma (A431) and desmoplastic prostate cancer (PC3) xenografts. The tumor accumulation of the 10 kDa PEG was characterized by rapid intercompartmental exchange and significantly improved upon active targeting with riboflavin (RF). The 40 kDa PEG accumulated in tumors four times more efficiently than the small polymer, but its accumulation did not profit from active RF-targeting. However, RF-targeting enhanced the cellular internalization in both tumor models and for both polymer sizes. Interestingly, the nanocarriers' cell-uptake in tumors was not directly correlated with the extent of accumulation. For example, in both tumor models the small RF-PEG accumulated much less strongly than the large passively targeted PEG but showed significantly higher intracellular amounts 24 h after iv administration. Additionally, the size of the polymer determined its preferential uptake by different tumor cell compartments: the 10 kDa RF-PEGs most efficiently targeted cancer cells, whereas the highest uptake of the 40 kDa RF-PEGs was observed in tumor-associated macrophages. These findings imply that drug carriers with sizes in the range of therapeutic antibodies show balanced properties with respect to passive accumulation, tissue penetration, and active targeting. Besides highlighting the potential of RF-mediated (cancer) cell targeting, we show that strong tumor accumulation does not automatically mean high cellular uptake and that the nanocarriers' size plays a critical role in cell- and compartment-specific drug targeting.""","""['Yoanna Tsvetkova', 'Nataliia Beztsinna', 'Maike Baues', 'Dionne Klein', 'Anne Rix', 'Susanne K Golombek', ""Wa'el Al Rawashdeh"", 'Felix Gremse', 'Matthias Barz', 'Kaloian Koynov', 'Srinivas Banala', 'Wiltrud Lederle', 'Twan Lammers', 'Fabian Kiessling']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nano Lett""","""['Amphiphilic Phospholipid-Based Riboflavin Derivatives for Tumor Targeting Nanomedicines.', 'Influence of Riboflavin Targeting on Tumor Accumulation and Internalization of Peptostar Based Drug Delivery Systems.', 'Photoacoustic imaging of tumor targeting with riboflavin-functionalized theranostic nanocarriers.', 'Riboflavin-Targeted Drug Delivery.', 'Effect of Physico-Chemical Properties of Nanoparticles on Their Intracellular Uptake.', 'Design, Synthesis, Characterization, and Evaluation of the Anti-HT-29 Colorectal Cell Line Activity of Novel 8-Oxyquinolinate-Platinum(II)-Loaded Nanostructured Lipid Carriers Targeted with Riboflavin.', 'Novel Tumor-Targeted Self-Nanostructured and Compartmentalized Water-in-Oil-in-Water Polyurethane-Polyurea Nanocapsules for Cancer Theragnosis.', 'Intracellular Pathways and Mechanisms of Colored Secondary Metabolites in Cancer Therapy.', 'Profiling target engagement and cellular uptake of cRGD-decorated clinical-stage core-crosslinked polymeric micelles.', 'Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy Monitors the Fate of Degradable Nanocarriers in the Blood Stream.']"""

Methods:   In 99 male patients with increased PSA plasma levels and previous negative standard biopsy procedures, mpMRI was carried out followed by US fusion guided perineal biopsy. PI-RADS-Data (PS) of mpMRI and histopathological Gleason score (GS) were categorized and statistically compared.  Results:   Lesions in 72/99 (73 %) of patients were determined to be suspect of malignancy, based on a PS 4 or 5. In 33/99 (33 %) of patients, malignancy could not be confirmed by histopathology. With regard to the remaining 66 patients with previous negative biopsy results, 42 (64 %) were diagnosed with a low-grade carcinoma (GS 6, 7a) and 24 (36 %) with a high-grade carcinoma (GS ≥ 7b). The proportion of corresponding results in mpMRI (PS 4-5) when a high-grade carcinoma had been detected, was 21/24 (88 %), which related to a sensitivity of 88 % and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 85 % (p = 0,002). In addition, 35 of 42 patients (83%), graded PS 4-5 in mpMRI, were diagnosed with low-grade carcinoma-positive (p < 0,001). Sensitivity to differentiation between low- and high-grade carcinomas (GS ≤ 7a vs. ≥ 7b) by means of PS was 88 % with a NPV of 70 % (p = 0,74).  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that mpMRI combined with US-fusion guided biopsy is able to detect considerably higher rates of clinically relevant prostate malignancies compared to conventional diagnostic procedures. However, no statistical significance could be shown regarding the differentiation between high- and low-grade carcinomas.

At this stage, the disease is deemed incurable. To date, the mechanisms of breast cancer-related metastasis to bone are poorly understood. This may be attributed to the lack of appropriate animal models to investigate the complex cancer cell-bone interactions. In this study, two established tissue-engineered bone constructs (TEBCs) were applied to a breast cancer-related metastasis model. A cylindrical medical-grade polycaprolactone-tricalcium phosphate scaffold produced by fused deposition modelling (scaffold 1) was compared with a tubular calcium phosphate-coated polycaprolactone scaffold fabricated by solution electrospinning (scaffold 2) for their potential to generate ectopic humanised bone in NOD/SCID mice. While scaffold 1 was found not suitable to generate a sufficient amount of ectopic bone tissue due to poor ectopic integration, scaffold 2 showed excellent integration into the host tissue, leading to bone formation. To mimic breast cancer cell colonisation to the bone, MDA-MB-231, SUM1315, and MDA-MB-231BO breast cancer cells were cultured in polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels and implanted adjacent to the TEBCs.

Recent evidence suggests that downregulation of gene of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 plays an important role in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in various types of cancers, including lung cancer. It was reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated gene (NEDD4) (also known as NEDD4-1) negatively regulated phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 protein levels through poly-ubiquitination and proteolysis in carcinomas of the prostate, lung, and bladder. Whether this process plays a role in epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors resistance in non-small-cell lung cancer has not been studied extensively. In view of this, we investigated the involvement of NEDD4 and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 in acquired erlotinib resistance with tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitive (HCC827) or tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant (Erlotinib-resistant HCC827/ER cells which harbored exon 19 deletion. Overexpression of NEDD4 in HCC827/ER cells was detected, and the reverse correlation between NEDD4 and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 expression in these cells was also revealed. In HCC827/ER cells with knockdown of NEDD4, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 and p-Akt expressions were decreased; the sensitivity of HCC827/ER cells to erlotinib was partially restored. Similar results were also observed in vivo. In H1650/ER cells harboring both exon 19 and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 deletion, expression of p-Akt and sensitivity to erlotinib were not affected by simple knockdown of NEDD4 but affected after transfection of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 into H1650/ER cells. Our results demonstrate that NEDD4 may promote the acquired resistance of non-small-cell lung cancer cells to erlotinib by decreasing phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 protein expression. Targeted decrease in NEDD4 expression may be a potential therapeutic strategy for tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer.""","""['Huake Sun', 'Huiwen Ma', 'Jianmin Wang', 'Liqin Xia', 'Guangkuo Zhu', 'Zhoufei Wang', 'Jianguo Sun', 'Zhengtang Chen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Tumour Biol""","""['Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid overcomes erlotinib-acquired resistance via phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10-mediated apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Knockdown of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene to investigate its therapeutic potential for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancers.', 'Upregulation of Neural Precursor Cell Expressed Developmentally Downregulated 4-1 is Associated with Poor Prognosis and Chemoresistance in Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Acquired resistance of non-small cell lung cancer to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.', 'RAKing in AKT: a tumor suppressor function for the intracellular tyrosine kinase FRK.', 'Lycorine suppresses cell growth and invasion via down-regulation of NEDD4 ligase in bladder cancer.', 'Unraveling the Potential Role of NEDD4-like E3 Ligases in Cancer.', 'The emerging roles of E3 ubiquitin ligases in ovarian cancer chemoresistance.', 'Oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 binds to KLF8 and regulates the microRNA-132/NRF2 axis in bladder cancer.', 'The biochemical and clinical implications of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten in different cancers.']"""

In this study, we investigate the role of miR‑212 on EN-2 expression and explored the mechanism of prostate cancer survival and metastasis. The relative expression levels of miR‑212 and EN-2 in PCa samples and adjacent normal tissues as well as in PCa cell lines were detected by using quantitative real-time PCR. CCK-8, TUNEL and Transwell assays were used to analyze cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion, respectively. EN-2 was identified as a direct target of miR‑212 via luciferase reporter and western blot assays. Results showed that the expression level of miR‑212 was downregulated in both PCa samples and PCa cell lines when compared with prostate epithelial cells and the adjacent no tumor tissues. Moreover, we found that overexpression of miR‑212 suppressed PCa cell proliferation and invasion, promoted PCa cell apoptosis. EN-2 was identified as a direct target gene of miR‑212 by using luciferase reporter and western blot assays. Also, the expression of EN-2 and miR‑212 in the PCa cells had an opposite correlation.

Among these five compounds, arenobufagin exhibited the most potent activity. We found that the mRNA and protein expression of β-catenin and β-catenin/TCF4 target genes, which are related to tumor invasion and metastasis, were down-regulated after arenobufagin treatment. Overexpression of β-catenin in PC3 cells antagonized the EMT inhibition effect of arenobufagin, while silencing β-catenin with siRNA enhanced the inhibitory effect of arenobufagin on EMT. In addition, arenobufagin restrained xenograft tumor EMT, as demonstrated by decreased mesenchymal marker expression and increased epithelial marker expression, and reduced the tumor metastatic foci in lung.

We also aimed to characterise testosterone recovery in this population.  Materials and methods:   This was a pre-specified secondary analysis of the ASCENDE-RT clinical trial. Three hundred and ninety-eight men were randomised. All received 12 months of ADT. The presence and frequency of flashes were patient reported. Cessation of flashes was defined as the first date a patient reported resolution of this symptom. Testosterone recovery was defined as any single serum testosterone above the threshold of 5, 7.5 or 10 nmol/l.  Results:   The median age and follow-up were 68 years and 6.1 years. Flashes were reported in 93% of men. Flashes began and reached peak frequency at a median time of 4.0 months from the first luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone injection when testosterone levels had fallen to castrate. The median time to cessation of flashes was 7.6 months after the cessation of ADT (last injection + 3 months), when the median testosterone had risen to 5.7 nmol/l. A resolution of flashes was reported in 99% of patients. Baseline testosterone was available in 338 patients (85%). The median baseline testosterone was 13.2 nmol/l. The median (95% confidence interval) time of testosterone recovery to thresholds of 5 nmol/l, 7.5 nmol/l and 10 nmol/l were 9 (9-10) months, 13 (10-15) months and 18 (17-19) months from the cessation of ADT. At the time of censor, 96, 94 and 91% of patients had recovered testosterone to thresholds of 5, 7.5 and 10 nmol/l.  Conclusion:   Flashes occur at castrate levels of testosterone, with cessation of hot flashes antedating full recovery of testosterone in most patients.

Another aim was to estimate the risks for developing secondary malignancies in bladder and rectum due to radiotherapy from the corresponding modalities. The treatment plans of ten prostate cancer patients were developed using IMRT and CRT. For the IMRT plans, two beam energies and two treatment protocols were used (the RTOG 0415 and a most restrictive one proposed by Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC)). For the evaluation of these plans, the complication-free tumor control probability, the total probability of injury, the total probability of control/benefit, and the biologically effective uniform dose were employed. Furthermore, based on the dosimetric data of IMRT and CRT, the risk for secondary malignancies was calculated for bladder and rectum. The average risk for secondary malignancy was lower for the bladder (0.37%) compared to the rectum (0.81%) based on all the treatment plans of the ten prostate cancer patients. The highest average risk for secondary malignancy for bladder and rectum was for the CRT-6X modality (0.46% and 1.12%, respectively) and the lowest was for the IMRT RTOG-18X modality (0.33% and 0.56%, respectively). The ≥ Grade 2 LENT/SOMA response probability was lower for the bladder than for the rectum in all the plans. For the bladder the highest average value was for the IMRT RTOG-18X (0.9%) and the lowest was for the CRT-18X modality (0.1%). For the rectum, the highest average value was for the IMRT RTOG-6X (11.9%) and the lowest was for the IMRT FCCC-18X modality (2.2%).

When combined with a testosterone level of >10.3 nmol/L, a WBC count of ≥6.2 was associated with increased mortality (HR 2.96; 95% CI 1.45-6.06) when compared with a WBC count of <6.2 (p-interaction = 0.01). The HR for biochemical recurrence for patients with a testosterone level >10.3 nmol/L combined with a lymphocyte level above or equal to the median was nearly identical to the HR of a testosterone level >10.3 nmol/L with a WBC above or equal to the median. There was no association between testosterone level and the NLR.  Conclusions:   A high WBC and lymphocyte count combined with normal testosterone levels increases the overall mortality of patients treated with radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer within the first 6-7 years post-treatment.

Recognizing the high prevalence of medicinal plant usage among Jamaicans at large, we investigated the engagement of such remedies by cancer patients, with the aim of uncovering self-medicating habits, perceptions and details of utilized plants.  Methods:   A structured, interviewer-based questionnaire was administered to 100 patients attending the oncology and urology clinics at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica. A method of convenience sampling was employed and the data were analyzed using summary statistics and statistical significance tests.  Results:   A large proportion (n = 80, 80%) of interviewed patients, engaged medicinal plants in their treatment regimes. Such habits were independent of person's education, economic status and were higher among the 55-74 age groups (p < 0.05) compared with younger patients. The use of herbs was hinged on the patient's strong sense of tradition and positive perspective of herbal efficacy (88%), fueled by anecdotal accounts from fellow patients. Majority of such users (74.7%) were under concomitant treatment with a prescription medicine, and worryingly, only 15% of patients made their oncologists aware. Annona muricata L. and Petiveria alliacea L. were the most commonly used plants for treating breast and prostate cancers, respectively.  Conclusion:   A large proportion of Jamaican cancer patients use medicinal plants in self-medicating practices and their perceptions and habits need to be considered by physicians, in the design of safe and effective care regimes.""","""['Kimberley Foster', 'Novie Younger', 'William Aiken', 'Doreen Brady-West', 'Rupika Delgoda']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['TRAMIL ethnomedicinal survey in Jamaica.', 'The prevalence of herbal medicine home use and concomitant use with pharmaceutical medicines in Jamaica.', 'The prevalence of herbs use in conjunction with conventional medicines in Jamaica.', 'A review of medicinal plant research at the University of the West Indies, Jamaica, 1948-2001.', 'Historical versus contemporary medicinal plant uses in the US Virgin Islands.', 'Cytotoxicity of Extracts from Petiveria alliacea Leaves on Yeast.', 'A Review on Annona muricata and Its Anticancer Activity.', 'In Silico Design and SAR Study of Dibenzyl Trisulfide Analogues for Improved CYP1A1 Inhibition.', 'Dibenzyl trisulfide induces caspase-independent death and lysosomal membrane permeabilization of triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Influence of Jamaican Cultural and Religious Beliefs on Adherence to Pharmacotherapy for Non-Communicable Diseases: A Pharmacovigilance Perspective.']"""

In these medical procedures, the needles are inserted inside the tissue to guide the positioning of the radioactive sources. The low-dose-rate radioactive sources are placed inside the tissue permanently, whereas a radioactive source in the high-dose-rate brachytherapy is temporarily placed in the desired positions so that the delivery of the prescription dose to the clinical targets can be achieved. Consequently, the precise needle placement directly influences the radiation dose delivery and the treatment outcomes of patients. Any deviation from the desired position of the radioactive sources can cause a suboptimal dose distribution and inadequate tumor coverage. Therefore, it is of significant importance to develop a robust and sophisticated tool that can perform the automatic needle placement with a high level of accuracy for different medical procedures and conditions. In this study, we propose a novel concept for the automatic needle insertion using a new miniature automated robotic system. The mathematical model of this system was presented in detail, allowing the implementation of the model predictive control that can be used to govern the mechanism. The purpose of this approach was to minimize the lateral components of the generalized reactive force which is responsible for the tissue displacement and, consequently, for the needle deflection. The proposed approach was designed to predict and to compensate for the unmeasured disturbances, such as needle deflection or tissue resistance and reactive force, and it was capable of correcting them without waiting until the effect appears at the output of the system causing the needle deviation from the desired positions. The extensive simulation of the system was presented to evaluate the feasibility of the method and the parameters of interest including displacements, system errors and system responses to the change in the environmental conditions.""","""['Ivan M Buzurovic', 'Slavisa Salinic', 'Peter F Orio', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Robert A Cormack']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Biol Eng Comput""","""['Effects of insertion speed and trocar stiffness on the accuracy of needle position for brachytherapy.', 'Needle deflection estimation: prostate brachytherapy phantom experiments.', 'A novel adaptive needle insertion sequencing for robotic, single needle MR-guided high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'AAPM and GEC-ESTRO guidelines for image-guided robotic brachytherapy: report of Task Group 192.', 'Brachytherapy--an example of a urological minimally invasive robotic procedure.']"""

Polyethylene glycol hyperbranched polymers were synthesised via RAFT polymerisation to feature glutamate urea targeting ligands for PSMA on the periphery. The chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin, was attached to the hyperbranched polymers through hydrazone formation, which allowed controlled release of the drug from the polymers in vitro endosomal conditions, with 90% release of the drug over 36 h. The polymers were able to target to PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells in vitro, and demonstrated comparable cytotoxicity to free doxorubicin. The ability of the hyperbranched polymers to specifically facilitate transport of loaded doxorubicin into the cells was confirmed using live cell confocal imaging, which demonstrated that the drug was able to travel with the polymer into cells by receptor mediated internalisation, and subsequently be released into the nucleus following hydrazone degradation. Finally, the ability of the complex to induce a therapeutic effect on prostate cancer cells was investigated through a long term tumour regression study, which confirmed that the DOX-loaded polymers were able to significantly reduce the volume of subcutaneous prostate tumours in vivo in comparison to free doxorubicin and a polymer control, with no adverse toxicity to the animals.

Objective:   To investigate the association of type of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with risk of CVD while minimising selection bias.  Design, setting, and participants:   Semi-ecologic study of 6556 men who received GnRH agonists and 3330 men who underwent orchiectomy as primary treatment during 1992-1999 in the Prostate Cancer Database Sweden 3.0.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We measured the proportion of men who received GnRH agonists as primary treatment in 580 experimental units defined by healthcare provider, diagnostic time period, and age at diagnosis. Incident or fatal CVD events in units with high and units with low use of GnRH agonists were compared. Net and crude probabilities were also analysed.  Results and limitations:   The risk of CVD was similar between units with the highest and units with the lowest proportion of GnRH agonist use (relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-1.11). Accordingly, there was no difference in the net probability of CVD after GnRH agonist compared to orchiectomy (hazard ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.96-1.09).

The main limitation was the nonrandom allocation to treatment, with younger men with lower comorbidity and less advanced cancer more likely to receive GnRH agonists.

Objective:   To investigate the associations of recreational PA, reported before and after diagnosis, with PCSM, overall and by tumor risk category.  Design, setting, and participants:   In a prospective cohort study conducted in the USA, men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 1992/1993 and June 2011 were followed for mortality until 2012. Patients were included in pre- (n=7328) and/or postdiagnosis (n=5319) analyses.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess PCSM with recreational PA.  Results and limitations:   A total of 454 and 261 prostate cancer deaths occurred during pre- and postdiagnosis follow-up, respectively. Prior to diagnosis, engaging in ≥17.5 metabolic equivalent hours per week (MET-h/wk) of recreational PA, compared with 3.5-<8.75 MET-h/wk, was associated with a significant 37% lower risk of PCSM (hazard ratio: 0.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.91, p trend=0.03) only among men with lower-risk tumors (Gleason score 2-7 and T1-T2; p interaction=0.02). A similar result was seen for walking but not for other recreational PA. After diagnosis, the same comparison (≥17.5 vs 3.5-<8.75 MET-h/wk) was associated with a significant 31% lower risk of overall PCSM (hazard ratio: 0.69, 95% confidence interval: 0.49-0.95, p trend=0.006), which did not differ by tumor risk category. Postdiagnosis walking had a suggestive inverse association with PCSM (p trend=0.07). These results were observational and may not be generalized to patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Residual confounding due to a higher screening rate among men with lower-risk tumors cannot be ruled out.  Conclusions:   The findings provide additional evidence for prostate cancer survivors to adhere to PA recommendations, and support clinical trials of exercise among prostate cancer survivors with progression or mortality as outcomes.

Materials and methods:   The study included 1477 consecutive patients treated with RARP by four surgeons between 2006 and 2014. UC recovery was defined as being completely dry over a 24-hour period at follow-up. Surgeon experience was coded as the total number of RARP performed by the surgeon before the patient's operation. Multivariable analysis tested the association between surgeon experience and UC recovery. Covariates consisted of patient age, Charlson comorbidity index, preoperative International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function domain (IIEF-EF), nerve-sparing surgery (none vs unilateral vs bilateral), and preoperative risk groups (low- vs intermediate- vs high risk).  Results:   The number of cases performed by each surgeon was 541, 413, 411, and 112, respectively. Median follow-up was 24 months (inter-quartile range: 18, 40). The UC recovery rate at 1 year after surgery was 82%. At multivariable analyses, surgeon experience represented an independent predictor of UC recovery (hazard ratio: 1.02, p < 0.001). The surgical learning curve was similar among surgeons, moving linearly from ∼60% of UC rate at the initial cases to almost 90% after more than 400 procedures.  Conclusions:   In patients undergoing RARP, surgeon experience is a significant predictor of UC recovery. The surgical learning curve of UC recovery does not reach a plateau even after more than 100 cases, suggesting a continuous improvement of the surgical technique.

Studies, which typically rely on geographic information system (GIS) calculated travel times, have found some evidence of racial disparities in spatial access to care. However, the validity of these studies depends on the accuracy of travel times by patient race.  Objectives:   To determine if there are racial differences when comparing patient-reported and GIS-calculated travel times.  Research design:   Data came from the Philadelphia Area Prostate Cancer Access Study (P Access), a cohort study of men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer. We conducted cross-sectional analysis of 2136 men using multivariable linear mixed-effects models to examine the effect of race on differences in patient-reported and GIS-calculated travel times to urology and radiation oncology cancer providers.  Results:   Patient-reported travel times were, on an average, longer than GIS-calculated times. For urology practices, median patient-reported travel times were 12.7 minutes longer than GIS-calculated travel times for blacks versus 7.2 minutes longer for whites. After adjusting for potential confounders, including socioeconomic status and car access, the difference was significantly greater for black patients than white patients (2.0 min; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-3.44).  Conclusions:   GIS-calculated travel time may underestimate access to care, especially for black patients.

Objective:   The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a 6-month home-based exercise intervention in PCSs.  Methods:   In this pilot, randomized controlled trial, 51 men (mean age, 70.8 years) were randomized to a 6-month home-based exercise intervention for preventing osteoporosis group (n = 26) or an exercise placebo intervention of stretching exercise group (n = 25). Primary outcomes were bone mineral density and bone turnover markers. Secondary outcomes were physical performance (level of physical activity, muscle strength, and balance) and health-related quality of life.  Results:   The patient retention rate for 6 months was 80.4%. The mean adherence rate was 84.7% for weight-bearing exercise and 64.8% for resistance exercise. No adverse events during the study period were reported. Although primary outcomes did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, the home-based exercise intervention for preventing osteoporosis group demonstrated significantly greater increased muscle strength than the stretching exercise group.  Conclusions:   A home-based exercise program is relatively feasible and safe and may improve muscle strength but not bone outcomes.  Implications for practice:   Given the importance of preventing cancer treatment-induced bone loss among PCSs receiving ADT, a home-based exercise intervention can be considered, but further trials with a larger sample are required to determine its effect for bone outcomes.""","""['Soo Hyun Kim', 'Do Hwan Seong', 'Sang Min Yoon', 'Young Deuk Choi', 'Eunju Choi', 'Youngkyu Song', 'Hosook Song']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""['Impact of resistance training on body composition and metabolic syndrome variables during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a pilot randomized controlled trial.', 'Efficacy of a multi-component exercise programme and nutritional supplementation on musculoskeletal health in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer (IMPACT): study protocol of a randomised controlled trial.', 'Efficacy of recreational football on bone health, body composition, and physical functioning in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy: 32-week follow-up of the FC prostate randomised controlled trial.', 'Effects of exercise on treatment-related adverse effects for patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: a systematic review.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy: evidence-based management of side effects.', 'Exercise Training in Elderly Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review.', 'Home-based physical activity after treatment for esophageal cancer-A randomized controlled trial.', 'Exercise and Bone Health in Cancer: Enemy or Ally?', 'Evolution of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) and Its New Emerging Modalities in Prostate Cancer: An Update for Practicing Urologists, Clinicians and Medical Providers.', 'The effects of exercise on body composition of prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy: An update systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

The amino acid sequence of SHP was identified as Leu‑Lys‑Glu‑Glu‑Asn‑Arg‑Arg‑Arg‑Arg‑Asp with a molecular mass of 1371.53 Da. The results of the proliferation assay revealed that SHP significantly inhibited the proliferation of PC‑3 cells in a time‑ and dose‑dependent manner. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining indicated significant SHP‑induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Annexin V/PI double‑staining assays revealed that the percentage of early‑ stage apoptotic cells increased from 8.85 to 29% following PC‑3 exposure to 5, 10 and 15 mg/ml SHP for 24 h. SHP‑induced apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of cellular tumor antigen p53 and caspase‑3, the upregulation of apoptosis regulator BAX, and the downregulation of apoptosis regulator Bcl‑2.

Thus, we suggest the need for identification of a new biomarker to discriminate PCa cases from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and normal controls (N).  Methods:   Urine or tissue samples of PCa patients, BPH patients, and normal controls were systematically collected. The expression of ferritin light chain (FTL) and ferritin heavy chain (FTH) was verified by immunohistochemistry in the tissue. The concentration of urinary ferritin was measured by Access Immunoassay. The level of creatinine in the urine was detected on a HITACHI 7080 system to calculate the ferritin-creatinine ratio (FCR). The data were statistically analyzed using the rank sum test.  Results:   Immunohistochemical characterization of tissues in patients with PCa and BPH was conducted. We found representative immunohistochemical expression of FTL and FTH, with strong staining intensity in PCa and weak staining intensity in BPH. Furthermore, there were differences in urinary FCR among the three groups, with significant differences in the PCa group (134.46±47.01) compared to both the BPH (24.18±3.17, p = 0.009) and control (6.42±0.82, p = 0.003) groups.

However, little is known about the association of rare variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] <1%) in the genome with prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   A two-stage study was used to test the association of rare, deleterious coding variants, annotated using predictive algorithms, with prostate cancer risk in Chinese men. Predicted rare, deleterious coding variants in the Illumina HumanExome-12 v1.1 beadchip were first evaluated in 1343 prostate cancer patients and 1008 controls. Significant variants were then validated in an additional 1816 prostate cancer patients and 1549 controls.  Results:   In the discovery stage, 14 predicted rare, deleterious coding variants were significantly associated with prostate cancer risk (P < 0.01). In the confirmation stage, Q1631H in TEX15 (rs142485241), a DNA repair gene, was significantly associated with prostate cancer risk (P = 0.0069).

In clinical practice, many centers use altitude correction factors that are not seed-model-specific. The purpose of this work is to present altitude correction factors for several seed models without documented factors in the literature.  Methods:   An in-house constructed pressure vessel was used with a well-type ionization chamber to measure the air-kerma strength of the IsoAid Advantage (Pd-103), Theragenics AgX100 (I-125), and Nucletron selectSeed (I-125) at a pressure range representative of those encountered worldwide. The TheraSeed 200 (Pd-103) was also measured for comparison to the originally published correction factor for validation of the experimental process. When correction factors derived in this work were within experimental uncertainties of those published, no new correction factors were proposed.  Results:   The three seed models measured herein all demonstrated a similar response to change in pressure as previously documented in the literature with the HDR 1000 Plus well-type ionization chamber. Correction factors of the functional form PA=k1(P[torr])k2, consistent with those previously published, were found to be appropriate for these seed models. A new correction factor is proposed for the Theragenics AgX100 and Nucletron selectSeed (k1 = 0.0417, k2 = 0.479). The IsoAid Advantage, however, agreed to within uncertainty with the published altitude correction factor for the TheraSeed 200; thus the application of the same correction factor is appropriate (k1 = 0.0241, k2 = 0.562).  Conclusions:   This work presents altitude correction factors for three permanent implant brachytherapy seed models in clinical use.

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate event-free probabilities.  Results:   The 56 patients were a median age of 67 years (range 51-84 years). After sipuleucel-T treatment, 25 patients developed bone progression after a median of 22 months of follow-up (54% of patients were event free at 2 years) and 10% (6/56 patients) developed rapid progression. Eleven deaths were observed after a median of 28 months of follow-up. Forty-eight patients were included in the multivariate analysis for overall survival. The analysis showed that age >70 years (p = 0.012), number of bone metastases >20 (p = 0.018), prior systemic treatment (p = 0.018), and ALP level >90 IU/L (p = 0.010) significantly predicted worse overall survival. Two-year overall survival was 36% among the 16 patients with two or more of these factors and was 93% among the 32 patients with one or none of these factors (p = 0.0004).  Conclusions:   CRPCa patients with age (>70 years), increased tumor burden in bone (>20 metastases and/or elevated ALP level), and/or prior systemic treatment are more likely to experience rapid deterioration after sipuleucel-T. These results need to be prospectively validated.""","""['Mehmet Asim Bilen', 'Kenneth R Hess', 'Sumit K Subudhi', 'Ana Aparicio', 'Jeri Kim', 'Amado J Zurita-Saavedra', 'John C Araujo', 'Paul G Corn', 'Jessica Stover', 'Sue-Hwa Lin', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Shi-Ming Tu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Survival Outcomes of Sipuleucel-T Phase III Studies: Impact of Control-Arm Cross-Over to Salvage Immunotherapy.', 'Clinical Variables Associated With Overall Survival in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Sipuleucel-T Immunotherapy.', 'Real-world outcomes of sipuleucel-T treatment in PROCEED, a prospective registry of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Sipuleucel-T for the Treatment of Metastatic Hormone-Relapsed Prostate Cancer: A NICE Single Technology Appraisal; An Evidence Review Group Perspective.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Prognostic value of serum alkaline phosphatase in the survival of prostate cancer: evidence from a meta-analysis.', 'Therapeutic Vaccines for Genitourinary Malignancies.']"""

Aberrant androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer is mediated by mechanisms such as alterations in the androgen receptor and activation of interacting signaling pathways. Clinical evidence confirms that resistance to the next-generation antiandrogen, enzalutamide, may be mediated to a large extent by alternative splicing of the androgen receptor to generate constitutively active splice variants such as AR-V7. The splice variants AR-V7 and ARv567es have been implicated in the resistance to not only enzalutamide, but also to abiraterone and other conventional therapeutics such as taxanes. Numerous studies, including ours, suggest that splicing factors such as hnRNPA1 promote the generation of AR-V7, thus contributing to enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we discovered that quercetin, a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound, reduces the expression of hnRNPA1, and consequently, that of AR-V7. The suppression of AR-V7 by quercetin resensitizes enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells to treatment with enzalutamide. Our results indicate that quercetin downregulates hnRNPA1 expression, downregulates the expression of AR-V7, antagonizes androgen receptor signaling, and resensitizes enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide treatment in vivo in mouse xenografts. These findings demonstrate that suppressing the alternative splicing of the androgen receptor may have important implications in overcoming the resistance to next-generation antiandrogen therapy.

In a comprehensive analysis we compared traditional and contemporary prostate biopsy techniques to detect prostate cancer with cribriform morphology with radical prostatectomy serving as the reference standard.  Materials and methods:   We queried a retrospectively maintained, single institution, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging database of 1,001 patients to identify 240 who underwent magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy and concurrent systematic biopsy from December 2014 to December 2016. Of the 3,978 biopsy cores obtained 694 positive cores were rereviewed by a genitourinary pathologist for pattern 4 subtype (cribriform, fused and poorly formed glands). Using paired analysis pathological results among 3 biopsy methods (systematic biopsy, targeted biopsy and systematic plus targeted biopsy) were compared. Prostatectomy specimens were also pathologically reviewed.  Results:   Systematic plus targeted biopsy was superior to systematic biopsy alone or targeted biopsy alone to detect cribriform morphology (all p <0.0001). On final histopathology cribriform tumor foci were associated with an increased percent of pattern 4 involvement and extraprostatic extension (p <0.0001 and 0.003, respectively). Only 17.4% of cribriform tumors in pure form were visible on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Based on final histopathology the sensitivity of systematic biopsy, targeted biopsy and systematic plus targeted biopsy for cribriform morphology was 20.7%, 28.6% and 37.1%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Although systematic plus targeted biopsy was the most accurate biopsy method to detect cribriform morphology, biopsy sensitivity and specificity remained poor.""","""['Matthew Truong', 'Changyong Feng', 'Gary Hollenberg', 'Eric Weinberg', 'Edward M Messing', 'Hiroshi Miyamoto', 'Thomas P Frye']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Erratum.', 'Conspicuity of cribriform prostate cancer on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging: the jury is still out.', 'Impact of Gleason Subtype on Prostate Cancer Detection Using Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Correlation with Final Histopathology.', 'Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Detection of Prostate Cancer Harboring Adverse Pathological Features of Intraductal Carcinoma and Invasive Cribriform Carcinoma.', 'Cribriform pattern and perineural invasion on MR/US fusion biopsy predict failure of selection criteria for prostatic hemigland ablation.', 'The cribriform morphology impairs Gleason 7 prostate cancer lesion detection on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Landmarks in the evolution of prostate biopsy.', 'Assessing the Role of High-resolution Microultrasound Among Naïve Patients with Negative Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and a Persistently High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer.', 'Oncological outcomes of cribriform histology pattern in prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Percentage Gleason pattern 4 and PI-RADS score predict upgrading in biopsy Grade Group 2 prostate cancer patients without cribriform pattern.', 'Integration of magnetic resonance imaging into prostate cancer nomograms.']"""

Materials and methods:   From 2009 to 2017 in 352 men prostate cancer was Gleason 3 + 3 in 268 and Gleason 3 + 4 in 84 at initial magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion biopsy. These men subsequently underwent a second fusion biopsy. At the first biopsy session all men underwent 12-core systematic biopsies and, when magnetic resonance imaging visible lesions were present, targeted biopsies. All cancerous sites were recorded electronically. During active surveillance at a second fusion biopsy session 6 to 18 months later tracking and systematic nontracking samples were obtained. The primary outcome measure was an increase in Gleason score (upgrading) at followup sampling, which was stratified by biopsy method.  Results:   Overall 91 of the 352 men (25.9%) experienced upgrading at the second biopsy during a median 11-month interval. The upgrade rate in the Gleason 3 + 3 and 3 + 4 groups was 26.9% and 22.6%, respectively. The mean number of cores taken at second biopsy was 12.2 ± 3.3 in men with upgrading and 12.4 ± 4.1 in those who remained stable (p not significant). Men with grade 0 to 4 magnetic resonance imaging targets were all upgraded at approximately the same rate of 20% to 30% (p not significant). However, 58.8% of the men with grade 5 magnetic resonance imaging targets were upgraded. Of the 91 upgrades 48 (53%) were detected only by tracking.

Urinary and sexual outcomes were assessed by EPIC-50 (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-50) before, 5 weeks and 12 months after radical prostatectomy. Spearman rank correlation coefficients and agreement/disagreement categories were used to describe the relation between function and bother.  Results:   Despite moderate to good agreement between function and bother (urinary r = 0.51-0.69 and sexual r = 0.65-0.80) discordant groups were observed. In the urinary domain these groups were men disproportionately bothered by function at baseline (16.9%) and 12 months after radical prostatectomy (6.1%) and men less bothered by function 5 weeks (26.8%) and 12 months (9.9%) after radical prostatectomy.

Splitting the urinary bother scale into 2 subscales, including one for incontinence related bother to complement the urinary function scale which measures only incontinence, and one for voiding dysfunction related bother yielded considerably better agreement (urinary function and incontinence related bother r = 0.78-0.83). Factors contributing to the group less bothered by sexual function were unclear.

Extending previous studies that the N-terminal activation domain (AD) of ETV5 interacts with Mediator subunit 25 (MED25), we establish that similar, aromatic-rich motifs located both in the AD and in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the related ETS factor ETV4 interact with MED25. These ETV4 regions bind MED25 independently, display distinct kinetics, and combine to contribute to a high-affinity interaction of full-length ETV4 with MED25. High-affinity interactions with MED25 are specific for the ETV1/4/5 subfamily as other ETS factors display weaker binding. The AD binds to a single site on MED25 and the DBD interacts with three MED25 sites, allowing for simultaneous binding of both domains in full-length ETV4. MED25 also stimulates the in vitro DNA binding activity of ETV4 by relieving autoinhibition. ETV1/4/5 factors are often overexpressed in prostate cancer and genome-wide studies in a prostate cancer cell line indicate that ETV4 and MED25 occupy enhancers that are enriched for ETS-binding sequences and are both functionally important for the transcription of genes regulated by these enhancers. AP1-motifs, which bind JUN and FOS transcription factor families, were observed in MED25-occupied regions and JUN/FOS also contact MED25; FOS strongly binds to the same MED25 site as ETV4 AD and JUN interacts with the other two MED25 sites. In summary, we describe features of the multivalent ETV4- and AP1-MED25 interactions, thereby implicating these factors in the recruitment of MED25 to transcriptional control elements.""","""['Simon L Currie', 'Jedediah J Doane', 'Kathryn S Evans', 'Niraja Bhachech', 'Bethany J Madison', 'Desmond K W Lau', 'Lawrence P McIntosh', 'Jack J Skalicky', 'Kathleen A Clark', 'Barbara J Graves']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Mol Biol""","""['Transcription Factor-Mediator Interfaces: Multiple and Multi-Valent.', 'Structured and disordered regions cooperatively mediate DNA-binding autoinhibition of ETS factors ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5.', 'Electrostatic repulsion causes anticooperative DNA binding between tumor suppressor ETS transcription factors and JUN-FOS at composite DNA sites.', 'Structures of the Ets Protein DNA-binding Domains of Transcription Factors Etv1, Etv4, Etv5, and Fev: DETERMINANTS OF DNA BINDING AND REDOX REGULATION BY DISULFIDE BOND FORMATION.', 'ETV1, 4 and 5: an oncogenic subfamily of ETS transcription factors.', 'Function and regulation of the PEA3 subfamily of ETS transcription factors in cancer.', 'Regulation of the RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex by its associated coactivators.', 'Identification and characterization of novel ETV4 splice variants in prostate cancer.', 'Transcription factors perform a 2-step search of the nucleus.', 'A Novel Mechanism of Coactivator Recruitment by the Nurr1 Nuclear Receptor.', 'The Mediator complex as a master regulator of transcription by RNA polymerase II.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate NCS that is more often associated with metastatic cancers than with benign diseases.  Methods:   Sixteen patients with NCS were diagnosed and treated. The oral and radiographic manifestations were assessed.  Results:   Four (25%) of 16 patients with NCS were affected by nonmalignant diseases (19% by medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw and 6% by osteopetrosis); yet 12 (75%) patient conditions were caused by malignant metastasis, either in the mandible (62%) or intracranial invasion (13%). NCS was unilateral in 13 cases and bilateral in three cases. Mandibular pain and masticatory weakness often dominate the clinical features in NCS associated with cancer metastasis. In two patients, NCS preceded the discovery of unknown malignancy (breast cancer and leukemia). In nine others, NCS heralded malignancy relapse and progression. Metastatic breast cancer in four (36%) cases accounted for the most common malignancy. Other metastatic diseases included two multiple myelomas, and one each of leukemia, prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, maxillary sinus adenoid cystic carcinoma and adrenal gland neuroblastoma. Radiographic examinations showed obvious mandibular metastasis with compression of the inferior alveolar nerve or mental nerve in nine patients, and leptomeningeal seeding or intracranial metastasis to the trigeminal nerve root at the skull base in two patients.

T2-weighted imaging performed better but did not clearly outperform DW imaging in the TZ (OR, 4.79 vs 3.77; P = .494). Lesions classified as PI-RADS category 3 at DW MR imaging and as positive at DCE imaging in the PZ showed a higher probability of cancer detection than did DCE-negative PI-RADS category 3 lesions (67.8% vs 40.0%, P = .02). The addition of DCE imaging to DW imaging in the PZ was beneficial (OR, 2.0; P = .027), with an increase in the probability of cancer detection of 15.7%, 16.0%, and 9.2% for PI-RADS category 2, 3, and 4 lesions, respectively. Conclusion DW imaging outperforms T2-weighted imaging in the PZ; T2-weighted imaging did not show a significant difference when compared with DW imaging in the TZ by PI-RADS version 2 criteria. The addition of DCE imaging to DW imaging scores in the PZ yields meaningful improvements in probability of cancer detection. © RSNA, 2017 An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.

With such a design, the single target miRNA input could be converted to large numbers of single-stranded DNA (S1-Trp and S2-Trp) output, which could be trapped by cucurbit[8]uril methyl viologen (CB-8-MV2+) based on the host-guest recognition, significantly enhancing the sensitivity for miRNA detection. Moreover, the nucleic acids products obtained from the process of cycling amplification could be utilized sufficiently, avoiding the waste and saving the experiment cost. Impressively, by resetting a settled voltage, the proposed biosensor could release S1-Trp and S2-Trp from the electrode surface, attributing that the guest ion methyl viologen (MV2+) was reduced to MV+· under this settled voltage and formed a more-stable CB-8-MV+·-MV+· complex. Once O2 was introduced in this system, MV+· could be oxidized to MV2+, generating the complex of CB-8-MV2+ for capturing S1-Trp and S2-Trp again in only 5 min. As a result, the simple and fast regeneration of biosensor for target detection was realized on the base of electrochemical redox-driven assembly and release, overcoming the challenges of time-consuming, burdensome operations and expensive experimental cost in traditional reusable biosensors and updating the construction method for a reusable bisensor. Furthermore, the biosensor could be reused for more than 10 times with a regeneration rate of 93.20%-102.24%. After all, the conception of this work provides a novel thought for the construction of effective reusable biosensor to detect miRNA and other biomarkers and has great potential application in the area requiring the release of nucleic acids or proteins.""","""['Yuanyuan Chang', 'Ying Zhuo', 'Yaqin Chai', 'Ruo Yuan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['A ratiometric electrochemical biosensor for the exosomal microRNAs detection based on bipedal DNA walkers propelled by locked nucleic acid modified toehold mediate strand displacement reaction.', 'Novel 2D-DNA-Nanoprobe-Mediated Enzyme-Free-Target-Recycling Amplification for the Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Detection of MicroRNA.', 'An isothermal electrochemical biosensor for the sensitive detection of microRNA based on a catalytic hairpin assembly and supersandwich amplification.', 'Biosensor-based microRNA detection: techniques, design, performance, and challenges.', 'Isothermal exponential amplification techniques: From basic principles to applications in electrochemical biosensors.', 'T7 Endonuclease I-mediated voltammetric detection of KRAS mutation coupled with horseradish peroxidase for signal amplification.']"""

Results:   The procedure is performed under general anesthesia, with the patient in lithotomy position. Briefly, the equipament utilized includes the cryotherapy console coupled with an ultrasound system, argon and helium gas bottles, cryoprobes, temperature probes and an urethral warming catheter. The procedure starts with a real-time trans-rectal prostate ultrasound, which is used to outline the prostate, the urethra and the rectal wall. The cryoprobes are pretested and placed in to the prostate through the perineum, following a grid template, along with the temperature sensors under ultrasound guidance. A cystoscopy confirms the right positioning of the needles and the urethral warming catheter is installed. Thereafter, the freeze sequence with argon gas is started, achieving extremely low temperatures (-40ºC) to induce tumor cell lysis. Sequentially, the thawing cycle is performed using helium gas. This process is repeated one time. Results among several series showed a biochemical disease-free survival between 71-93% at 9-70 month- follow-up, incontinence rates between 0-3.6% and erectile dysfunction between 0-42% (1-5).

Material and methods:   Expression levels of miR-483-5p were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The effect of miR-483-5p on proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, cell invasion was evaluated by trans-well invasion assays, and target protein expression was determined by western blotting in LNCaP, DU-145, and PC-3 cells. Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed to confirm the action of miR-483-5p on downstream target gene RBM5 in HEK-293T cells.  Results:   we observed that miR-483-5p was upregulated in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. A miR-483-5p inhibitor inhibited prostate cancer cell growth and invasion in DU-145 and PC-3 cells. miR-483-5p directly bound to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of RBM5 in HEK-293T cells.

In the current study, the authors sought to determine whether access to care, measured across multiple dimensions, contributed to racial differences in prostate cancer.  Methods:   The Philadelphia Area Prostate Cancer Access Study (P2 Access) included 2374 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2012 and 2014. Men were surveyed to assess their experiences accessing care (response rate of 51.1%). The authors determined appointment availability at 151 urology practices using simulated patient telephone calls and calculated travel distances using geospatial techniques. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association between 5 different domains of access (availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability, and acceptability) and receipt of treatment, perceived quality of care, and physician-patient communication.  Results:   There were 1907 non-Hispanic white and 394 black men in the study cohort. Overall, approximately 85% of the men received definitive treatment with no differences noted by race. Black men were less likely to report a high quality of care (69% vs 81%; P<.001) and good physician-patient communication (60% vs 71%; P<.001) compared with white men. In adjusted models, none of the 5 domains of access were found to be associated with definitive treatment overall or with radical prostatectomy. All access domains were associated with perceived quality of care and communication, although these domains did not mediate racial disparities.  Conclusions:   To the authors' knowledge, the current study presents the first comprehensive assessment of prostate cancer care access, treatment, and patient experience, demonstrating that although access was related to overall perceived quality of care and better physician-patient communication, it did not appear to explain observed racial differences.

The technique approximates the exact BAO formulation with efficiently computable convex surrogates, leading to plans that are inferior to those attainable with recently proposed gradient-based greedy schemes. In this paper, we alleviate/reduce the nontrivial inconsistencies between the [Formula: see text]-based formulations and the exact BAO model by proposing a new sparse optimization framework based on the most recent developments in group variable selection. We propose the incorporation of the group-folded concave penalty (gFCP) as a substitution to the [Formula: see text]-minimization framework. The new formulation is then solved by a variation of an existing gradient method. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by both plan quality and the computational efficiency using three IMRT cases: a coplanar prostate case, a coplanar head-and-neck case, and a noncoplanar liver case. Involved in the evaluation are two alternative schemes: the [Formula: see text]-minimization approach and the gradient norm method (GNM). The gFCP-based scheme outperforms both counterpart approaches. In particular, gFCP generates better plans than those obtained using the [Formula: see text]-minimization for all three cases with a comparable computation time. As compared to the GNM, the gFCP improves both the plan quality and computational efficiency.

The aim of the present study was to prospectively assess the effect of surgical removal of the prostate on levels of Apo10 and TKTL1 in blood macrophages using Epitope Detection In Monocytes (EDIM).  Methods:   We prospectively enrolled 174 patients with clinically localized PC undergoing radical prostatectomy. Peripheral blood was collected preoperatively in all patients and postoperatively in a subgroup of 72 patients. We separately assessed the proportion of CD14/CD16-positive monocytes expressing Apo10 and TKTL1 using flow cytometry. The proportion of positive cells was multiplied by ten to generate a score for Apo10 and TKTL1, separately. Pre- and postoperative scores of Apo10 and TKTL1 were compared. Moreover, results were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters.  Results:   In the total cohort, Median preoperative Apo10 and TKTL1 scores were 136 (Range 101-254) and 139 (102-216). In patients who underwent blood collection and testing either pre- and postoperatively (n = 72), median pre- versus postoperative scores were 132 (101-215) versus 103 (70-156) for Apo10 (P < 0.0001) and 140 (102-212) versus 115 (84-187) (P < 0.0001) for TKTL1. Following radical prostatectomy, 56 (77.7%) and 59 (81.9%) patients in the cohort of patients with blood collection before and after prostatectomy showed a decrease of Apo10 and TKTL1 expressing monocytes. TKTL1 and Apo10 did not show any correlation with known histopathologic and clinical risk parameters.  Conclusions:   The present study demonstrates that surgical removal of the primary tumor leads to a significant decrease of Apo10 and TKTL1 expressing macrophages. This observation further encourages studies assessing the optimal clinical utility of EDIM-based detection of Apo10 and TKTL1 in patients with PC.""","""['Tilman Todenhöfer', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Gabriel Keller', 'Tim Neumann', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Jens Bedke']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Biomarkers Apo10 and TKTL1: Epitope-detection in monocytes (EDIM) as a new diagnostic approach for cholangiocellular, pancreatic and colorectal carcinoma.', 'Evaluation of a biomarker based blood test for monitoring surgical resection of oral squamous cell carcinomas.', 'A biomarker based detection and characterization of carcinomas exploiting two fundamental biophysical mechanisms in mammalian cells.', 'EDIM-TKTL1/Apo10 Blood Test: An Innate Immune System Based Liquid Biopsy for the Early Detection, Characterization and Targeted Treatment of Cancer.', 'Consensus Statement on Circulating Biomarkers for Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Epitope Detection in Monocytes (EDIM) As a New Method of Liquid Biopsy in Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Epitope detection in monocytes (EDIM) for liquid biopsy including identification of GD2 in childhood neuroblastoma-a pilot study.', 'Research landscape of liquid biopsies in prostate cancer.']"""

Alterations in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis and PTEN expression have been implicated in the development and progression of several human tumors including PCa. We examined the expression of the insulin receptor (INSR), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), PTEN, and AKT in radical prostatectomy tissue of patients who developed BCR post-surgery.  Methods:   Tissue microarrays (TMA) of 130 patients post-radical prostatectomy (65 = BCR, 65 = non-BCR) were stained by immunohistochemistry for INSR, IGF-1R, PTEN, and AKT using optimized antibody protocols. INSR, IGF1-R, PTEN, and AKT expression between benign and cancerous tissue, and different Gleason grades was assessed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to examine the relationship between proteins expression and BCR.  Results:   INSR (P < 0.001), IGF-1R (P < 0.001), and AKT (P < 0.05) expression was significantly increased and PTEN (P < 0.001) was significantly decreased in cancerous versus benign tissue. There was no significant difference in INSR, IGF-1R, or AKT expression in the cancerous tissue of non-BCR versus BCR patients (P = 0.149, P = 0.990, P = 0.399, respectively). There was a significant decrease in PTEN expression in the malignant tissue of BCR versus non-BCR patients (P = 0.011). Combinational analysis of the tissue proteins identified a combination of decreased PTEN and increased AKT or increased INSR was associated with worst outcome. We found that in each case, our hypothesized worst group was most likely to experience BCR and this was significant for combinations of PTEN+INSR and PTEN+AKT but not PTEN+IGF-1R (P = 0.023, P = 0.028, P = 0.078, respectively).

Methods:   The study was population-based with a cross-sectional design and was conducted at two acute care hospitals. We performed 142 one-day inventories (n = 2972) in 2007 and 139 in 2012 (n = 2843) to register symptoms, care needs, and diagnosis based on a questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression models were used in the analysis.  Results:   During 2007 and 2012 combined, 10% (n = 589) of hospitalized patients were assessed as having cancer in a palliative phase. Prostate (12%) and colorectal (12%) cancers were most common. Pain (42%) and deterioration (42%) were the most prevalent symptoms and were associated with pancreas cancer in our regression models (p = 0.003 and p = 0.019, respectively). Other cancers had different associations: hematologic malignancies were associated with infections and blood transfusions (p < 0.001), breast cancer with pleurocentesis (p = 0.002), and stomach/esophagus cancer with nausea (p < 0.001). Nausea was more common in women than in men (p < 0.01). The mean number of symptoms/care needs was 2.9; patients with stomach/esophagus cancer had the highest number of symptoms/care needs (3.5).

However, pelvic PTVs, when coadministered in a single plan (registered to gold markers [GM]), require reassessment of the margin concept since prostate movement is independent from the pelvic bony anatomy to which the lymphatics are usually referenced to.  Methods:   We have therefore revisited prostate translational movement relative to the bony anatomy to obtain adequate margins for the pelvic PTVs compensating mismatch resulting from referencing pelvic target volumes to GMs in the prostate. Prostate movement was analyzed in a set of 28 patients (25 fractions each, totaling in 684 fractions) and the required margins calculated for the pelvic PTVs according to Van Herk's margin formula [Formula: see text].  Results:   The overall mean prostate movement relative to bony anatomy was 0.9 ± 3.1, 0.6 ± 3.4, and 0.0 ± 0.7 mm in anterior/posterior (A/P), inferior/superior (I/S) and left/right (L/R) direction, respectively. Calculated margins to compensate for the resulting mismatch to bony anatomy were 9/9/2 mm in A/P, I/S, and L/R direction and 10/11/6 mm if an additional residual error of 2 mm was assumed.  Conclusion:   GM-based IGRT for pelvic PTVs is feasible if margins are adapted accordingly.

Another key regulator of cellular metabolism is mTOR, a kinase found in diverse protein complexes and cellular localizations, including the nucleus. However, whether nuclear mTOR plays a role in PCa progression and participates in direct transcriptional cross-talk with the AR is unknown. Here, via the intersection of gene expression, genomic, and metabolic studies, we reveal the existence of a nuclear mTOR-AR transcriptional axis integral to the metabolic rewiring of PCa cells. Androgens reprogram mTOR-chromatin associations in an AR-dependent manner in which activation of mTOR-dependent metabolic gene networks is essential for androgen-induced aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. In models of castration-resistant PCa cells, mTOR was capable of transcriptionally regulating metabolic gene programs in the absence of androgens, highlighting a potential novel castration resistance mechanism to sustain cell metabolism even without a functional AR. Remarkably, we demonstrate that increased mTOR nuclear localization is indicative of poor prognosis in patients, with the highest levels detected in castration-resistant PCa tumors and metastases. Identification of a functional mTOR targeted multigene signature robustly discriminates between normal prostate tissues, primary tumors, and hormone refractory metastatic samples but is also predictive of cancer recurrence.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of pomegranate peel extract (PoPx) on the apoptosis and metastasis of prostate cancer cells and the related mechanism. We found that PoPx showed growth inhibition on prostate cancer cells. Nuclei morphological and flow cytometer (FCM) analysis indicated that PoPx could induce prostate cancer apoptosis. Further investigation indicated that mitochondrial mediated intrinsic pathway is involved in the apoptosis. Exposure to PoPx led to loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δym), accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Western blot analysis showed that PoPx could increase the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl2 and activation of apoptosis executor caspase 3. Wound healing assay and transwell migration and invasion assay implied that PoPx has the potential to inhibit migration and invasion, two critical steps in prostate cancer metastasis.

The objective of this work is to study the local agreement pattern between two continuous measurements subject to censoring. In this article, we propose a new agreement measure based on bivariate hazard functions to characterize the local agreement pattern between two correlated survival outcomes. The proposed measure naturally accommodates censored observations, fully captures the dependence structure between bivariate survival times and provides detailed information on how the strength of agreement evolves over time. We develop a nonparametric estimation method for the proposed local agreement pattern measure and study theoretical properties including strong consistency and asymptotical normality.

The CALIPER project has recruited a large healthy cohort and completed a series of a priori studies to address gaps in pediatric RIs. As immunoassays from different manufacturers for endocrine and special chemistry markers are not standardized and show marked intermethod differences, direct RI studies are needed for each major analytical platform. Here, we report age- and sex-specific pediatric RIs for 29 immunoassays on the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (Ortho) VITROS® 5600 analyzer.  Methods:   Health information and blood samples were collected from healthy pediatric subjects. Using the Ortho VITROS 5600 Integrated System MicroWell Technology, 29 biomarkers were measured. Analyte concentrations were partitioned by age and sex according to the Harris and Boyd method. After removing outliers, age- and sex-specific RIs and corresponding 90% confidence intervals were calculated according to CLSI guidelines.  Results:   All analytes required age partitioning except β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3), rubella immunoglobulin G (rubella IgG), and vitamin D. Several analytes including estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), total triiodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), thyroid uptake, ferritin, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), free prostate-specific antigen (fPSA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), and myoglobin showed sex differences, observed mostly with the onset of puberty.  Conclusions:   Complex reference value trends were observed across the pediatric age range for several biomarkers examined on Ortho VITROS immunoassays. The availability of VITROS immunoassay RIs will enable accurate laboratory test interpretation and diagnosis for the pediatric population. As recommended by the CLSI EP28-A3c guidelines, implementation of these RIs should be validated for each laboratory's local pediatric population.""","""['Victoria Higgins', 'Angela W S Fung', 'Man Khun Chan', 'Joseph Macri', 'Khosrow Adeli']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Chem Lab Med""","""['Corrigendum to: Pediatric reference intervals for 29 Ortho VITROS 5600 immunoassays using the CALIPER cohort of healthy children and adolescents.', 'Paediatric reference intervals for 17 Roche cobas 8000 e602 immunoassays in the CALIPER cohort of healthy children and adolescents.', 'Pediatric reference value distributions and covariate-stratified reference intervals for 29 endocrine and special chemistry biomarkers on the Beckman Coulter Immunoassay Systems: a CALIPER study of healthy community children.', 'CLSI-based transference and verification of CALIPER pediatric reference intervals for 29 Ortho VITROS 5600 chemistry assays.', 'The Canadian laboratory initiative on pediatric reference intervals: A CALIPER white paper.', 'Paediatric reference intervals are heterogeneous and differ considerably in the classification of healthy paediatric blood samples.', 'Pediatric reference interval verification for 17 specialized immunoassays and cancer markers on the Abbott Alinity i system in the CALIPER cohort of healthy children and adolescents.', 'Current State of Pediatric Reference Intervals and the Importance of Correctly Describing the Biochemistry of Child Development: A Review.', 'Age- and sex-specific reference intervals for thyroid hormones in a Chinese pediatrics: a prospective observational study of 1,279 healthy children.', 'Time Points for Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Stimulation Test Results in Korean Children.']"""

Currently available prediction tools and biomarkers do not always allow for early recognition of PPCa aggressive phenotype, sometimes making it impossible to distinguish among men harbouring indolent tumours or life-threatening disease.  Objective:   To establish a novel ex vivo/in vitro model suitable to estimate the invasive phenotype of PPCa cells (PPCaC).  Design, setting, and participants:   The ability of PPCaC to infiltrate the prostate extracellular matrix (ECM) was used as an index of invasion. ECM was obtained by decellularising 24 NT-prostate specimens from radical prostatectomy. PPCaC were obtained from six tumours with different Gleason patterns and pathological stages. Invasion ability was estimated in direct-cocolture experiments.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The extent of ECM invasion by PPCaC was quantified by counting the number of infiltrated cells. Mann-Whitney test was utilised for statistical comparisons.  Results and limitations:   Samples of ECM resulted to be free of cells and DNA and with a preserved three-dimensional structure and stromal protein content. The system resulted to be reliable since well characterised normal-, benign-, and malignant-prostate cell lines either re-epitheliased or invaded the matrices, according to their specific nature. Similarly, PPCaC invaded the ECMs consistently with their stage and biochemical recurrence. Of notice, this model was able to identify a different invasive phenotype even among tumours with equal Gleason patterns and pathological stages. The small sample size represents a limitation.  Conclusions:   We developed an ex vivo/in vitro model able to reproduce the original PPCa-microenvironment and suitable to recognise the inherent invasive behaviour of PPCaC.  Patient summary:   We developed a novel ex vivo/in vitro system which enables us to uncover which prostate tumours host potentially aggressive cancer cells. The identification of cancer cells with different invasive abilities will likely lead to the identification of new biomarkers to safely predict disease progression.""","""['Walter Cazzaniga', 'Manuela Nebuloni', 'Erika Longhi', 'Irene Locatelli', 'Raffaele Allevi', 'Roberta Lucianò', 'Gelsomina Senatore', 'Eugenio Ventimiglia', 'Vito Cucchiara', 'Luca Genovese', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Massimo Alfano', 'Andrea Salonia', 'Ilaria Cavarretta']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Multiple Tissue Biomarkers Independently and Additively Predict Prostate Cancer Pathology Outcomes.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '3D extracellular matrix interactions modulate tumour cell growth, invasion and angiogenesis in engineered tumour microenvironments.', 'Should the Gleason grading system for prostate cancer be modified to account for high-grade tertiary components?

It facilitates the progression of gliomas and prostate cancer, but its expression and functional relevance have not been studied in lymphoma. Here, we evaluated MAOA in 427 cases of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and in a spectrum of reactive lymphoid tissues by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. MAOA was expressed by Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in the majority of classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHLs) (181/241; 75%), with 34.8% showing strong expression. Weak MAOA was also noted in a minority of primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphomas (8/47; 17%) and in a mediastinal gray-zone lymphoma. In contrast, no MAOA was found in non-neoplastic lymphoid tissues, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL; 0/8) or any other non-Hodgkin lymphomas studied (0/123). MAOA was more common in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative compared to EBV-positive cHL (p < 0.0001) and was especially prevalent in the EBV-negative nodular sclerosing subtype. Similar to primary human lymphoma specimens, most cHL-derived cell lines displayed MAOA activity, whereas non-Hodgkin-lymphoma-derived cell lines did not. The MAOA inhibitor clorgyline reduced the growth of L1236 cells and U-HO1 cells, and shRNA knockdown of MAOA reduced the growth of L1236 cells. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of MAOA increased the growth of MAOA-negative HDLM2 cells. Combined treatment with clorgyline and ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) was more effective in reducing cell growth than either regimen alone. In summary, MAOA is highly expressed in cHL and may reflect the distinct biology of this lymphoma.

Methods and materials:   Patients treated more than 4 years ago with 131Cs (n=290) were asked to fill out an Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) QOL questionnaire and American Urological Association Symptom Score (AUASS) survey, before treatment and at each follow-up appointment. We compared patients' EPIC and AUA scores at baseline with scores at a last follow-up of at least 4 years after treatment using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.  Results:   At a median last follow-up of 5.5 years after treatment with 131Cs prostate brachytherapy there were no clinically significant changes in the EPIC or AUA scores from baseline. There was statistical worsening in the EPIC urinary incontinence subscore. Subset analyses revealed improved QOL outcomes in patients who received external beam radiation therapy or α-blocker therapy, whereas androgen deprivation therapy was not associated with differences in QOL change.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate minimal long-term changes in urinary or bowel patient-reported QOL with 131Cs prostate brachytherapy.

This affords the statistical power to compare PCSM outcomes among different treatment modalities even when restricting the analysis to patients treated in the modern era. The purpose of the present study was to compare the survival outcomes among patients with GP 5 PCa on needle core biopsy or transurethral resection of the prostate who underwent extremely dose-escalated radiation therapy (RT; exemplified by external beam RT with a brachytherapy boost [EBRT + BT]) versus radical prostatectomy (RP) in the modern era.  Methods and materials:   A total of 7669 men with a diagnosis of GP 5 PCa from 2004 to 2013 who had undergone EBRT + BT or RP were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. After propensity score matching to balance the patient characteristics, PCSM was compared between modalities using a multivariate Fine and Gray competing risk model that accounted for other-cause mortality, with adjustment for age, race, GP, and clinical T stage.  Results:   Patients treated with RP were younger and had a lower burden of GP 5, lower T stage, and lower other-cause mortality than patients who underwent EBRT + BT. After propensity score matching, no difference was found in PCSM between the RP and EBRT + BT groups (adjusted hazard ratio 1.018; P=.910). The cumulative 5-year PCSM incidence rates were 5.6% and 6.1% for patients undergoing RP and EBRT + BT, respectively. Patients with primary GP 5 experienced significantly greater PCSM than those with secondary GP 5, regardless of the treatment modality.  Conclusions:   For patients with GP 5 PCa found on needle core biopsy or transurethral resection of the prostate, RP and EBRT + BT offer equivalent PCSM in a competing risk model after propensity score matching to balance the differences in patient characteristics.""","""['Chenyang Wang', 'Amar U Kishan', 'Mitchell Kamrava', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Christopher R King']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Radical Prostatectomy, External Beam Radiotherapy, or External Beam Radiotherapy With Brachytherapy Boost and Disease Progression and Mortality in Patients With Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'Ten-year survival after High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy combined with External Beam Radiation Therapy in high-risk prostate cancer: A comparison with the Norwegian SPCG-7 cohort.', 'Significant association of brachytherapy boost with reduced prostate cancer-specific mortality in contemporary patients with localized, unfavorable-risk prostate cancer.', 'Low-dose rate brachytherapy for men with localized prostate cancer.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Biochemical failure and toxicity in treatment with brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy compared with radical prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Models for Patients With Gleason Score 9 Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Study.', 'Polish Brachytherapy Society - Presidential opening: Chasing Brachytherapy.', 'Treatment outcomes of prostate cancer patients with Gleason score\xa08-10 treated with definitive radiotherapy : TROD 09-001 multi-institutional study.']"""

Methods and materials:   The participants were randomized to yoga and no-yoga cohorts (1:1). Twice-weekly yoga interventions were offered throughout the 6- to 9-week courses of RT. Comparisons of standardized assessments were performed between the 2 cohorts for the primary endpoint of fatigue and the secondary endpoints of erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and QOL before, during, and after RT.  Results:   From October 2014 to January 2016, 68 eligible PCa patients underwent informed consent and agreed to participate in the study. Of the 68 patients, 18 withdrew early, mostly because of treatment schedule-related time constraints, resulting in 22 and 28 patients in the yoga and no-yoga groups, respectively. Throughout treatment, those in the yoga arm reported less fatigue than those in the control arm, with global fatigue, effect of fatigue, and severity of fatigue subscales showing statistically significant interactions (P<.0001). The sexual health scores (International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire) also displayed a statistically significant interaction (P=.0333). The International Prostate Symptom Score revealed a statistically significant effect of time (P<.0001) but no significant effect of treatment (P=.1022). The QOL measures had mixed results, with yoga having a significant time by treatment effect on the emotional, physical, and social scores but not on functional scores.

Methods:   This retrospective, HIPAA-compliant, IRB-approved study included 140 patients with PCa who underwent 3 T mpMRI with endorectal coil and transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS-G) biopsy before RP. MpMRI was used to classify lesions using a two-tier (low-grade/PGG 1 vs. high-grade/PGG 2-5) or a three-tier system (low-grade/PGG 1 vs. intermediate-grade/PGG 2 vs. high-grade/PGG 3-5). Accuracy of mpMRI was compared against RP for each system.  Results:   The predictive accuracy of mpMRI using the two-tier system is higher than when using three-tier system (0.77 and 0.45, respectively). There were similar rates of undergrading between mpMRI and TRUS-G biopsy compared to RP (16% & 21%; respectively); rate of overgrading was higher for mpMRI vs. TRUS-G biopsy compared to RP (42% & 17%, respectively). When mpMRI and TRUS-G biopsy are combined, rate of undergrading is 1.4% and overgrading is 11%.  Conclusions:   MpMRI predictive accuracy is higher when using a two-tier vs. a three-tier system, suggesting that advanced metrics may be necessary to delineate intermediate- from high-grade disease. Rates of under- and overgrading decreased when mpMRI and TRUS-G biopsy are combined, suggesting that these techniques may be complementary in predicting tumor grade.""","""['Jamie N Holtz', 'Rachel Kloss Silverman', 'Kae Jack Tay', 'Jill T Browning', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Rajan T Gupta']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Index Tumor Detection: Correlation with Radical Prostatectomy Specimen.', 'Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Risk-based Patient Selection for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsy after Negative Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Random Biopsy Avoids Unnecessary Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'In vitro anti-hepatocellular carcinogenesis of 1,2,3,4,6-Penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose.', 'Oncological and Functional Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Individualized Partial Gland Cryoablation of the Prostate: A Single-Institution Experience.', 'Extracapsular extension on MRI indicates a more aggressive cell cycle progression genotype of prostate cancer.', 'Assessment of prostate cancer prognostic Gleason grade group using zonal-specific features extracted from biparametric MRI using a KNN classifier.']"""

Objective:   We assessed how well the 4Kscore predicts pathology at radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   Among 1312 men who prospectively underwent a 4Kscore and biopsy of the prostate at 26 sites throughout the United States from October 2013 to April 2014, we selected men who were diagnosed with cancer and underwent RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was the presence of high-grade PCa or extracapsular extension. We assessed the association between the 4Kscore and the grade and extent of PCa at RP using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. We used logistic regression to investigate the added value of the 4Kscore in predicting a high-grade or non-organ-confined tumor when added to available postbiopsy clinical predictive tools.  Results and limitations:   A total of 144 men were diagnosed with PCa and underwent RP. Higher 4Kscores were associated with higher grade at RP. For men with Gleason scores ≥6, 7, and 8 cancers in the surgical specimen, the median 4Kscores were 7% (interquartile range [IQR]: 4-2), 25% (IQR: 12-38), and 47% (IQR: 24-66) (p<0.0001), respectively. The median 4Kscore among men with non-organ-confined cancer was significantly higher then men with organ-confined cancers (36% [IQR: 19-58] vs 19% [IQR: 9-35]; p=0.002). The 4Kscore did not significantly add to available clinical prediction tools for determining the likelihood of a high grade or non-organ-confined cancer; however, we were limited by a small sample size for this analysis.  Conclusions:   In a subset of men who underwent RP, the 4Kscore was significantly associated with pathologic grade and extracapsular extension in the surgical specimen, with higher scores associated with higher grade and more aggressive histology. The 4Kscore test may be helpful in selecting men who are likely to have adverse pathologic features at RP that may preclude them from being safely observed.

Cisplatin, which is one of the chemotherapeutic agents used for its treatment, is associated with a very high rate of resistance. Par-4 (prostate apoptosis response 4) is a tumor suppressor, which is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether combined treatment with Par-4 and cisplatin is effective for inhibiting growth of Wilms' tumor. Wilms' tumor and control cell samples were collected and analyzed by immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry. Total proteins extracted from cultured cells were analyzed using western blotting and flow cytometry. In addition, a mouse xenograft model was established. We discovered significantly low expression of Par-4 in the tumor tissue, which was positively correlated with high expression of GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78). In addition, we found that ectopic Par-4 co-localized with cell surface GRP78 and induced high expression of the endoplasmic reticulum proteins ATF4 and BAX, which activated the endoplasmic reticulum apoptosis pathway.

In conclusion, our results showed that Par-4 overexpression and cisplatin had a synergistic effect on SK-NEP-1 cells, as a result of which cell growth was inhibited and cellular apoptosis was induced.

However, it is surprising how rare the scientific evidence about RJ antineoplastic capacity are. That being said, we investigated, for the first time, the in vitro bioactivity of six different RJs on the growth of three different mammalian cell lines: immortalized murine myoblasts (C2C12), human prostate cancer (PC3) and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y). These studies were performed treating the cells with the only lipophilic, or hydrophilic, fraction of the RJs, a scientific approach never performed before. Moreover, chemical and protein profiles of all RJs were finely characterized, in qualitative and quantitative terms, by GC-MS and 1D-SDS-PAGE, respectively, in order to give a complete framework to the research. Despite the deep differences we found in the composition of each sample, unexpectedly, RJs showed comparable or very similar biological effects. In particular, our attention was captured by the extraordinary antiproliferative activity of the lipophilic extract of all RJs against SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting a potential medical application of this bee product to prevent the onset and slow down the growth of human neuroblastoma.""","""['Angelo Gismondi', 'Eleonora Trionfera', 'Lorena Canuti', 'Gabriele Di Marco', 'Antonella Canini']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Acetazolamide potentiates the anti-tumor potential of HDACi, MS-275, in neuroblastoma.', 'Vincristine induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells.', 'Effects of bergamot essential oil and its extractive fractions on SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell growth.', 'New Findings on Biological Actions and Clinical Applications of Royal Jelly: A Review.', ""SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line: in vitro cell model of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease."", 'Royal Jelly: Beneficial Properties and Synergistic Effects with Chemotherapeutic Drugs with Particular Emphasis in Anticancer Strategies.', 'Structural characterization and antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles synthesized using a low-molecular-weight Royal Jelly extract.', 'Attenuated glutamate induced ROS production by antioxidative compounds in neural cell lines.', 'Ginkgo biloba extract protects human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells against oxidative glutamate toxicity by activating redoxosome-p66Shc.', 'Thymoquinone anticancer activity is enhanced when combined with royal jelly in human breast cancer.']"""

Scutellarin, an active major flavone glycoside isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Scutellaria altissima L., has been shown to offer various beneficial biochemical effects on cerebrovascular diseases and inflammation. However, the antiproliferative effects of Scutellarin in prostate cancer and the underlying mechanism are not fully elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to ascertain whether Scutellarin inhibits cancer cell growth and to further explore the molecular mechanism. Scutellarin enhanced the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to cisplatin. MTT assays revealed that cell viability was significantly decreased in the prostate cancer cells treated with Scutellarin. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that Scutellarin suppressed cell proliferation by promoting G2/M arrest and inducing apoptosis. We employed western blotting to delineate the underlying mechanisms involved in the G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Comet assay and γH2AX immunocytochemistry were used to detect levels of DNA damage in PC3 cells exposed to Scutellarin and/or cisplatin. Our data revealed that Scutellarin significantly induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis by activating the caspase cascade. An increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase were accompanied by the apoptosis induction. Additionally, Scutellarin altered the protein expression of cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory genes by downregulating Cdc2, cyclin B1 and Bcl-2 and upregulating caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bax in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, Scutellarin sensitized PC3 cells to cisplastin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our data confirmed the cytotoxicity of Scutellarin against prostate cancer PC3 cells and provide new findings in regards to Scutellarin sensitizing prostate cancer cells to chemotherapy. Our findings suggest that Scutellarin has potential to be used as a novel antineoplastic therapeutic candidate for prostate cancer patients.""","""['Chen Gao', 'Yinglu Zhou', 'Zhongling Jiang', 'Yuan Zhao', 'Dongjun Zhang', 'Xia Cong', 'Rongfeng Cao', 'Huatao Li', 'Wenru Tian']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Scutellarin suppresses growth and causes apoptosis of human colorectal cancer cells by regulating the p53 pathway.', 'Induction of G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by ginsenoside Rf in human osteosarcoma MG‑63 cells through the mitochondrial pathway.', 'Urtica dioica dichloromethane extract induce apoptosis from intrinsic pathway on human prostate cancer cells (PC3).', 'Clinical benefits and pharmacology of scutellarin: A comprehensive review.', 'From traditional medicine to modern oncology: Scutellarin, a promising natural compound in cancer treatment.', 'Induction of RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis by Erigeron breviscapus injection exhibits potent antitumor effect.', 'Autophagy Induction by Scutellaria Flavones in Cancer: Recent Advances.', 'Polyphenols of Chinese skullcap roots: from chemical profiles to anticancer effects.', 'β-Caryophyllene from Chilli Pepper Inhibits the Proliferation of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells by Affecting miR-659-3p-Targeted Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SphK1).', 'Combined Scutellarin and C18H17NO6 Imperils the Survival of Glioma: Partly Associated With the Repression of PSEN1/PI3K-AKT Signaling Axis.']"""

Oxygen deprivation prompted a number of changes in intracellular composition and metabolic activity, mainly reflecting upregulated glycolysis, amino acid catabolism and other compensatory mechanisms used by hypoxic cells to deal with oxidative imbalance and energy deficit. Cell treatment with a non-cytotoxic concentration of DES, under hypoxia, triggered significant changes in 17 metabolites. Among these, lactate, phosphocreatine and reduced glutathione, whose levels showed opposite variations in hypoxic and drug-treated cells, emerged as possible markers of DES-induced HIF-1α inhibition. Furthermore, the free drug had a much higher impact on the cellular metabolome than tert-DES, particularly concerning polyamine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways, known to be tightly involved in cell proliferation and growth.

We analyzed outcomes in men with low prostate specific antigen and a high disease burden who received the oral androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide in the PREVAIL (Safety and Efficacy Study of Oral MDV3100 in Chemotherapy-Naive Patients with Progressive Metastatic Prostate Cancer) study.  Materials and methods:   In this exploratory analysis low baseline prostate specific antigen was defined as less than 10 ng/ml. Post hoc analyses included radiographic progression-free and overall survival in the once daily enzalutamide and placebo arms. Patients were stratified post hoc by high volume disease, defined as more than 4 bone metastases and/or visceral disease, and low volume disease, defined as 4 or fewer bone metastases with no visceral disease.  Results:   Of 1,717 patients enrolled in PREVAIL 242 (14.1%) had low baseline prostate specific antigen, including 110 with high volume disease. Enzalutamide decreased the risk of radiographic progression relative to placebo in patients with low baseline prostate specific antigen (HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.10-0.42). This decrease was irrespective of tumor burden (high volume disease HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.06-0.51 and low volume disease HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.70). Median overall survival was not reached in patients with low baseline prostate specific antigen in either treatment arm.

Materials and methods:   Men with clinically localized high or very high risk prostate cancer were imaged with 18F-DCFPyL positron emission tomography/computerized tomography before undergoing radical prostatectomy with standardized pelvic lymph node dissection. The scans were interpreted by 2 blinded nuclear medicine readers and assessed for interreader variability as well as diagnostic accuracy for pelvic lymph node staging. Surgical pathology served as the reference standard to which 18F-DCFPyL scan findings were compared.  Results:   A total of 25 men contributed analyzable data to this study. Seven of these patients (28%) were found to have 1 or more positive lymph nodes on surgical pathology. Sites of radiotracer uptake were identified in the prostate of all imaged patients. The 2 readers identified the same number of prostatic lesions in 22 patients (88%), of whom all had at least 1 intraprostatic lesion in common between the 2 reads. Additionally, the readers assigned the same N stage to 46 of 50 individual lymph node packets (92%). Following reconciliation of the relatively few discordant imaging reads, 7 patients (28%) were found to have 1 or more sites of radiotracer uptake in the pelvis consistent with N1 disease, resulting in 71.4% sensitivity (95% CI 29.0-96.3) and 88.9% specificity (95% CI 65.3-98.6).

We sought to determine the change in prostate cancer presentation coinciding with the release of the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommendations against screening in a high-volume community-based urology practice.  Methods:   Characteristics of men presenting for an elevated PSA at a community urology practice from August 2011 to August 2015 were queried from a prospectively collected database. A retrospective analysis of presenting PSA, Gleason grade at biopsy, and prostatectomy as well as clinical and pathologic stage was performed. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum and chi-square tests were used for analysis.  Results:   Referrals for elevated PSA decreased from 933 in year 1 to 816 by year 4 (12.5% decrease) with a concomitant reduction in biopsies performed in newly referred men from 461 to 356 (22.8% decrease, P = 0.02). The proportion of men presenting with PSAs>10 increased from 28.1% to 36.8% (P = 0.009).

It commonly develops in older males, but the number of younger men diagnosed with the disease has increased in recent years. Hormone therapies, such as chemical and surgical methods that inhibit androgen synthesis or androgen receptor (AR) activation, have been used for advanced disease. However, castration-resistant PC (CRPC), which exhibits androgen-independent mechanisms for activating AR, develops after a few years of such treatment and no therapy is available. In this study, we examined differences in the proteomes associated with the androgen-dependent (DHT treatment) and -independent (FSK, forskolin treatment) AR signaling conditions in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we used EPI-001, which inhibits AR-mediated transcriptional activity, to examine whether the observed differences in protein expression were directly affected by AR-mediated mechanisms. A total of 213 protein spots were matched in our 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) analysis and 8 proteins with significant expression changes in our 5 different treatment groups were identified by mass spectrometry. Among these proteins, expression levels of PEPCK-M, catalase, tubulin alpha chain, alpha-enolase, and endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 29 were significantly altered by DHT and the levels of HSP 90 and EF-Tu were changed by FSK. These changes were blocked by EPI-001 in DHT-regulated proteins, PEPCK-M, catalase, and tubulin alpha chain and FSK-regulated EF-Tu protein. The results from our immunohistochemical analysis using in vivo xenograft models were consistent with the 2DE data. We therefore report the first identification of differences in proteins that are significantly regulated under androgen-dependent and -independent AR signaling conditions. Our findings could suggest a possible molecular mechanism through which AR is activated in the absence and/or presence of androgen, and might help explain the inhibitory action of EPI-001 on CRPC.""","""['Seho Cha', 'Dong Hoon Shin', 'Jun Ryeong Seok', 'Jae Kyung Myung']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Targeting Androgen Receptor Activation Function-1 with EPI to Overcome Resistance Mechanisms in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'TGF-beta signaling and androgen receptor status determine apoptotic cross-talk in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Castration-recurrent prostate cancer is not androgen-independent.', 'Lncap-AI prostate cancer cell line establishment by Flutamide and androgen-free environment to promote cell adherent.', 'Characterization of Proteins Regulated by Androgen and Protein Kinase a Signaling in VCaP Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'SWATH-MS Based Proteomic Profiling of Prostate Cancer Cells Reveals Adaptive Molecular Mechanisms in Response to Anti-Androgen Therapy.', 'Reduced pim-1 expression increases chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by inducing apoptosis.', 'The Role of ZNF143 in Breast Cancer Cell Survival Through the NAD(P)H Quinone Dehydrogenase 1⁻p53⁻Beclin1 Axis Under Metabolic Stress.']"""

Three patients who underwent PAI just before prostate biopsy and subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy were included. The PAI appearance was retrospectively reviewed, and in each patient, 4 representative areas were selected: 1 with high PAI signal intensity, 1 with low PAI signal intensity, 1 peripheral to the index tumor, and 1 inside the index tumor. The correlation of PAI intensity with 3 microvascular parameters-microvascular density, total vascular area (TVA), and total vascular length (TVL)-assessed by CD34-immunostaining in resected specimens was analyzed.  Results:   In all 3 patients the PAI intensity, TVA, and TVL in areas with high-intensity PAI signals were significantly higher than those in areas with low-intensity PAI signals, suggesting that PAI appearance describes the distribution of microvasculature in prostatic tissue correctly. All index tumors showed a ring-like PAI appearance consisting of a peripheral area of high signal intensity completely or partially surrounding an area with low signal intensity. The PAI intensity, TVA, and TVL in the periphery of the index tumors were significantly higher than those inside of the index tumors.

Uni- and multivariable analyses of PSA nadir and TTN with time from nadir to BCR were performed with Cox models (adjusted for demographics, tumor features, and preoperative PSA).  Results:   Among men with an undetectable PSA nadir, the TTN was unrelated to BCR (1.0-2.9 vs 3-6 months: hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, P = .46). Regardless of TTN, men with detectable nadir had an increased risk of BCR (TTN of 3-6 months: HR 1.81, P = .024; TTN of 1.0-2.99 months: HR 3.75, P <.001 vs undetectable nadir and TTN of 3-6 months).

In prostate cancer, HIF1α interplays with androgen receptor (AR) to contribute to the progression of this disease to its lethal form-castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Hypoxia upregulates several epigenetic factors including histone demethylase KDM3A which is a critical co-factor of HIF1α. However, how histone demethylases regulate hypoxia signaling is not fully understood. Here, we report that histone demethylase PHF8 plays an essential role in hypoxia signaling. Knockdown or knockout of PHF8 by RNAi or CRISPR-Cas9 system reduced the activation of HIF1α and the induction of HIF1α target genes including KDM3A. Mechanistically, PHF8 regulates hypoxia inducible genes mainly through sustaining the level of trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), an active mark in transcriptional regulation. The positive role of PHF8 in hypoxia signaling extended to hypoxia-induced neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), wherein PHF8 cooperates with KDM3A to regulate the expression of NED genes. Moreover, we discovered that the role of PHF8 in hypoxia signaling is associated with the presence of full-length AR in CRPC cells. Collectively, our study identified PHF8 as a novel epigenetic factor in hypoxia signaling, and the underlying regulatory mechanisms likely apply to general cancer development involving HIF1α. Therefore, targeting PHF8 can potentially be a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer therapy.""","""['Peterson Kariuki Maina', 'Peng Shao', 'Xiongfei Jia', 'Qi Liu', 'Shaikamjad Umesalma', 'Maximo Marin', 'Donald Long Jr', 'Samantha Concepción-Román', 'Hank Heng Qi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Gene Regul Mech""","""['c-MYC drives histone demethylase PHF8 during neuroendocrine differentiation and in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The histone demethylase KDM3A regulates the transcriptional program of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Systematic knockdown of epigenetic enzymes identifies a novel histone demethylase PHF8 overexpressed in prostate cancer with an impact on cell proliferation, migration and invasion.', 'Insights into The Function and Regulation of Jumonji C Lysine Demethylases as Hypoxic Responsive Enzymes.', 'Structural insights into histone lysine demethylation.', 'Role of primary aging hallmarks in Alzheimer´s disease.', 'Potential epigenetic molecular regulatory networks in ocular neovascularization.', 'Aggressive variants of prostate cancer: underlying mechanisms of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation.', 'Applications and developments of gene therapy drug delivery systems for genetic diseases.', 'Contribution of synergism between PHF8 and HER2 signalling to breast cancer development and drug resistance.']"""

In this study, we characterize the effects of upregulated miRNA 574-3p on gene expression in the tumor microenvironment through different bioinformatic tools such as Diana-Tools, the KEGG Pathway Database, and the Reactome Database. We have identified nine regulatory genes that are targeted by miRNA 574-3p and downregulated in prostate cells. Pathway analysis of these genes shows that they are involved in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, apoptosis, DNA damage response, G1 to S cell-cycle control, inflammatory response pathway, angiogenesis, translation factors, and the expression of oncogenes. Our results show the oncogenic potential of miRNA 574-3p in PCa progression and metastasis. Moreover, this study highlights the complex molecular mechanisms and pathways affected by the upregulation of miRNA 574-3p in prostate cells. In future studies, the presented data may aid in designing new therapies for PCa with improved efficacy.""","""['Naeem M Ashraf', 'Komal Imran', 'David W Kastner', 'Khadija Ikram', 'Ayesha Mushtaq', 'Aadil Hussain', 'Nadia Zeeshan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Cell Probes""","""['Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Androgen receptor-regulated miRNA-193a-3p targets AJUBA to promote prostate cancer cell migration.', 'miR-199a-3p inhibits aurora kinase A and attenuates prostate cancer growth: new avenue for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Recent scenario of microRNA as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'MiRNA targets of prostate cancer.', 'Urinary MicroRNAs as Biomarkers of Urological Cancers: A Systematic Review.', 'A comprehensive review on RNA interference-mediated targeting of interleukins and its potential therapeutic implications in colon cancer.', 'Isolation and Characterization of Urinary Extracellular Vesicles from Healthy Donors and Patients with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'In silico functional and tumor suppressor role of hypothetical protein PCNXL2 with regulation of the Notch signaling pathway.', 'Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells promote prostate cancer cell stemness via cell-cell contact to activate the Jagged1/Notch1 pathway.']"""

The aim of surgical treatment for metastatic spine disease is generally palliative to address pain and/or neurologic compromise, significantly improving patients' quality of life. Patients with metastatic spine disease, however, represent a vulnerable cohort and may have comorbidities or previous treatments that impair the structural integrity of spinal hardware. As such, identifying factors that may contribute to hardware failure is an essential component in treating individuals with metastatic spine disease.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to identify pre-operative risk factors associated with hardware failure in patients undergoing surgical treatment for metastatic spine disease.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted to include patients surgically treated for metastatic spine tumors between 2003 and 2013, at a single institution. A univariate analysis was initially performed to identify associated factors. Any associated factor with a p-value <0.20 was included in the multivariate analysis.  Results:   3 patients (1.9%), of the 159 patients included in the study, had failure of the spine instrumentation. 1 patient had metastatic prostate cancer, and 2 had metastatic breast cancer. Patient demographics, co-morbidities, tumor location, and primary tumor etiology were not found to be statistically significant, with respect to hardware failure. Predictive factors included in the multivariate model were other bone metastasis, visceral metastasis, brain metastasis, Modified Rankin scale, previous systemic chemotherapy, previous radiation to the spine, and mean survival. Previous radiation to the spine was the only factor to be significantly associated (p=0.029), present in all three patients with hardware failure. Of note, there was a trend indicating that patients with longer life expectancies were more likely to experience hardware failure (mean survival of 16.7months in non-failure cohort vs. 33months in failure cohort), though this did not achieve statistical significance due to the limited sample size of patients with hardware failure.  Conclusion:   Hardware failure is a risk for all patients who undergo instrumentation following resection for metastatic spine tumors. This study identified that pre-operative radiation may increase the risk for hardware failure in this population.""","""['Rachel Pedreira', 'Nancy Abu-Bonsrah', 'A Karim Ahmed', 'Rafael De la Garza-Ramos', 'C Rory Goodwin', 'Ziya L Gokaslan', 'Justin Sacks', 'Daniel M Sciubba']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Neurosci""","""['Incidence and Predictors of Hardware Failure After Instrumentation for Spine Metastasis: A Single-Institutional Series.', 'The incidence and patterns of hardware failure after separation surgery in patients with spinal metastatic tumors.', 'Risk factors for wound-related reoperations in patients with metastatic spine tumor.', 'Surgical management of metastatic spinal tumors.', 'Contemporary spinal oncology treatment paradigms and outcomes for metastatic tumors to the spine: A systematic review of breast, prostate, renal, and lung metastases.', 'Systemic considerations for the surgical treatment of spinal metastatic disease: a scoping literature review.', 'Feasibility of postoperative spine stereotactic body radiation therapy in proximity of carbon and titanium hybrid implants using a robotic radiotherapy device.', 'A Novel Approach to Ray Resection of the Hand.', 'Hardware Failure in Spinal Tumor Surgery: A Hallmark of Longer Survival?', 'Complication Avoidance in Surgical Management of Vertebral Column Tumors.']"""

Methods and materials:   Rectal toxicity results and dose-volume histogram (DVH) information from patients treated on FASTR and SATURN were combined. Patients in both trials received long-term androgen deprivation and H-SIB with prescription dose 40 Gy to the prostate and proximal seminal vesicles and 25 Gy to the lymph nodes delivered over 5 weekly fractions using image guidance with cone beam computed tomography. Mean rectal DVH values at 5-Gy intervals and mean DVH curves were compared between patients with rectal bleeding (B) versus no bleeding (NB).  Results:   There were 12 B and 33 NB patients in the pooled group. Rectal bleeding was more frequent and of higher grade among FASTR patients (8/15, 5 grade 2 or higher) than among SATURN patients (4/30, all grade 1). For any bleeding (grade ≥1), individual dose-volume points in the 20 to 40 Gy range were significantly different (2-sided P < .05) between the B and NB groups, with the 40 Gy point being the most significant (B: V40 = 1.53%, standard deviation (SD), 1.32; NB: V40 = 0.69%, SD, 1.46; P = .006). For grade ≥2 bleeding, the V20 Gy was most significant (B: 68.4%, SD, 4.76; NB: 40.45%, SD, 13.9; P < .001).  Conclusions:   The higher relative dose volumes to the rectum (V20-V40) were most strongly associated with clinically significant bleeding in this analysis and are consistent with findings of series that used H-SIB to treat prostate only. Differences in the prostate target volumes and planning margins likely account for the differences in the rates and grades of rectal bleeding observed between trials.""","""['Glenn Bauman', 'Jeff Chen', 'George Rodrigues', 'Melanie Davidson', 'Andrew Warner', 'Andrew Loblaw']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Late rectal bleeding after conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Between December 2014 and March 2016, a total of 114 LESS RPs and RCs were performed, comprising 68 LESS RPs, 38 LESS RCs with cutaneous ureterostomy (CU) and eight LESS RCs with orthotopic ileal neobladder (OIN). Access was achieved via a single-port, with four channels placed through a transumblical incision. After the apex of prostate was separated from the urethra, a self-developed port ('Zhu's port') was inserted through the urethra to facilitate resection of prostate and urethrovesical anastomosis. The peri-operative and postoperative data were collected and analysed retrospectively. Patients were followed up postoperatively for evidence of long-term side effects.  Results:   All the procedures were completed successfully. No conversion to conventional laparoscopic surgery was necessary. For LESS RP, the average operating time was 152 min. Estimated blood loss was 117 mL. The mean hospital stay was 16.4 days after surgery. For LESS RC with CU and LESS RC with OIN, the mean operating times were 215 and 328 min, mean estimated blood loss was 175 and 252 mL, and mean hospital stay was 9.4 and 18.2 days, respectively. Six patients required blood transfusion (5.26%). Intra-operative complications occurred in two patients (1.75%), and postoperative complications in nine (7.89%). Fourteen out of 68 (20.6%) patients who underwent LESS RP had positive surgical margins. Follow-up ranged from 10 to 30.6 months. In the prostate cancer cases, good urinary control was observed in 35.3%, 97.1% and 100% of patients at 1, 6 and 12 months after the operation, respectively, while biochemical recurrence was observed in 11.8% patients. In the bladder cancer cases, two patients had local recurrence and two patients had distant metastasis.

We have previously shown that adrenal-derived androstenedione (AD) is the preferred substrate over testosterone (T) for 5α-reductase expressed in metastatic CRPC, bypassing T as an obligate precursor to DHT. However, the metabolic pathway of adrenal-derived DHT biosynthesis has not been rigorously investigated in the setting of primary disease in the prostate.Experimental Design: Seventeen patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were consented for fresh tissues after radical prostatectomy. Prostate tissues were cultured ex vivo in media spiked with an equimolar mixture of AD and T, and stable isotopic tracing was employed to simultaneously follow the enzymatic conversion of both precursor steroids into nascent metabolites, detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. CRPC cell line models and xenograft tissues were similarly assayed for comparative analysis. A tritium-labeled steroid radiotracing approach was used to validate our findings.Results: Prostatectomy tissues readily 5α-reduced both T and AD. Furthermore, 5α-reduction of AD was the major directionality of metabolic flux to DHT. However, AD and T were comparably metabolized by 5α-reductase in primary prostate tissues, contrasting the preference exhibited by CRPC in which AD was favored over T. 5α-reductase inhibitors effectively blocked the conversion of AD to DHT.Conclusions: Both AD and T are substrates of 5α-reductase in prostatectomy tissues, resulting in two distinctly nonredundant metabolic pathways to DHT. Furthermore, the transition to CRPC may coincide with a metabolic switch toward AD as the favored substrate.

Patients and methods:   Register-based cohort study of 4309 consecutive patients who underwent prostatectomy from 2006 to 2013 (2241 RALP, 1818 OP and 250 LP). Patients were followed from 12 months before to 12 months after prostatectomy with respect to service use in primary care (general practitioners, therapists, specialists etc) and hospitals (inpatient and outpatient activity related to prostatectomy and comorbidity). Tariffs of the activity-based remuneration system for primary care and the Diagnosis-Related Grouping case-mix system for hospital-based care were used to value service use. Costs attributable to RALP were estimated using a difference-in-difference analytical approach and adjusted for patient-level and hospital-level risk selection using multilevel regression.  Results:   No significant effect of RALP on resource-use was observed except for a marginally lower use of primary care and fewer bed days as compared with OP (not LP). The overall cost consequence of RALP was estimated at an additional €2459 (95% CI 1377 to 3540, p=0.003) as compared with OP and an additional €3860 (95% CI 559 to 7160, p=0.031) as compared with LP, mainly due to higher cost intensity during the index admissions.  Conclusions:   In this study from the Danish context, the use of RALP generates a factor 1.3 additional cost when compared with OP and a factor 1.6 additional cost when compared with LP, on average, based on 12 months follow-up.

Methods:   Three male subjects, before undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, were cooled via an ECB, rendered MRI compatible for patient safety before ECB hypothermia. MRI studies were performed using a 3T scanner and included T2-weighted anatomic scan for the pelvic structures, followed by a temperature mapping scan. The sequence was performed repeatedly during the cooling experiment, whereas the phase data were collected using an integrated MR-high-intensity focused ultrasound workstation in real time. Pelvic cooling was instituted with a cooling console located outside the MRI magnet room.  Results:   The feasibility of pelvic cooling measured a temperature drop of the ECB of 20-25 degrees in real time was achieved after an initial time delay of 10-15 seconds for the ECB to cool. The thermal MRI anatomic images of the prostate and neurovascular bundle demonstrate cooling at this interface to be 10-15 degrees, and also that cooling extends into the prostate itself ~5 degrees, and disperses into the pelvic region as well.  Conclusion:   An MRI-compatible ECB coupled with thermal MRI is a feasible method to assess effective hypothermic diffusion and saturation to pelvic structures.

In addition to its anti-diabetic effect, metformin has also been associated with a reduced risk of cancer incidence of a number of solid tumours, including prostate cancer (PCa). However, the underlying biological mechanisms for these observations have not been fully characterised in PCa. One hypothesis is that the indirect insulin lowering effect may have an anti-neoplastic action as elevated insulin and insulin like growth factor - 1 (IGF-1) levels play a role in PCa development and progression. In addition, metformin is a potent activator of activated protein kinase (AMPK) which in turn inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and other signal transduction mechanisms. These direct effects can lead to reduced cell proliferation. Given its wide availability and tolerable side effect profile, metformin represents an attractive potential therapeutic option for men with PCa. Hence, the need for a clinical trial investigating its biological mechanisms in PCa.  Methods:   METAL is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, window of opportunity study investigating the biological mechanism of metformin in PCa. 100 patients with newly-diagnosed, localised PCa scheduled for radical prostatectomy will be randomised 1:1 to receive metformin (1 g b.d.) or placebo for four weeks (+/- 1 week) prior to prostatectomy. Tissue will be collected from both diagnostic biopsy and prostatectomy specimens. The primary endpoint is the difference in expression levels of markers of the Fatty acid synthase (FASN)/AMPK pathway pre and post treatment between the placebo and metformin arms. Secondary endpoints include the difference in expression levels of indicators of proliferation (ki67 and TUNEL) pre and post treatment between the placebo and metformin arms. METAL is currently open to recruitment at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London.  Discussion:   This randomised placebo-controlled double blinded trial of metformin vs. placebo in men with localised PCa due to undergo radical prostatectomy, aims to elucidate the mechanism of action of metformin in PCa cells, which should then enable further larger stratification trials to take place.

The molecular pathways in this response remain unelucidated, however, previous data has supported a role for cell membrane-metabolism related pathways including an up regulation of UDP glycosyltransferase 8 (UGT8), which catalyzes the transfer of galactose to ceramide, a lipid that is associated with the induction of apoptotic signalling. In this study, the role of UGT8 in responses of prostate tumours to ultrasound-stimulated microbubble radiation enhancement therapy is investigated. Experiments were carried out with cells in vitro and tumours in vivo in which UGT8 levels had been up regulated or down regulated. Genetically modified PC3 cells were treated with XRT, US+MB, or a combination of XRT+US+MB. An increase in the immunolabelling of ceramide was observed in cells where UGT8 was down-regulated as opposed to cells where UGT8 was either not regulated or was up-regulated. Clonogenic assays have revealed a decreased level of cellular survival with the down-regulation of UGT8. Xenograft tumours generated from stably transfected PC3 cells were also treated with US+MB, XRT or US+MB+XRT. Histology demonstrated more cellular damage in tumours with down-regulated UGT8 in comparison with control tumours. In contrast, tumours with up-regulated UGT8 had less damage than control tumours. Power Doppler imaging indicated a reduction in the vascular index with UGT8 down-regulation and photoacoustic imaging revealed a reduction in oxygen saturation. This was contrary to when UGT8 was up regulated. The down regulation of UGT8 led to the accumulation of ceramide resulting in more cell death signalling and therefore, a greater enhancement of radiation effect when vascular disruption takes place through the use of ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles.""","""['Azza Al-Mahrouki', 'Anoja Giles', 'Amr Hashim', 'Hyunjung Christina Kim', 'Ahmad El-Falou', 'Dean Rowe-Magnus', 'Golnaz Farhat', 'Gregory J Czarnota']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cellular characterization of ultrasound-stimulated microbubble radiation enhancement in a prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Non-invasive monitoring of ultrasound-stimulated microbubble radiation enhancement using photoacoustic imaging.', 'Ultrasound-activated microbubble cancer therapy: ceramide production leading to enhanced radiation effect in vitro.', 'Biomechanical effects of microbubbles: from radiosensitization to cell death.', 'Ultrasound-stimulated microbubble enhancement of radiation response.', 'Ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles enhancement of fractionated radiation for tumor treatment.', 'Radioenhancement with the Combination of Docetaxel and Ultrasound Microbubbles: In Vivo Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluating the effects of radiation and acoustically-stimulated microbubble therapy in an in vivo breast cancer model.', 'MR-guided ultrasound-stimulated microbubble therapy enhances radiation-induced tumor response.', 'Focused Ultrasound Stimulation of Microbubbles in Combination With Radiotherapy for Acute Damage of Breast Cancer Xenograft Model.']"""

SLE was prepared using 100% ethanol and added to LNCaP cells for 24 hours. Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and cell apoptosis was evaluated by Tali assay. The expression of apoptosis-related mRNA and proteins was analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and western blotting. SLE treatment decreased the viability of LNCaP cells and increased Bax expression while suppressing the expression of pro-caspases-8/9/3, PARP, Bid, and Bcl-2, thereby inducing apoptosis in LNCaP cells. Cell proliferation related proteins, including p-Akt, androgen receptor, and prostate-specific antigen, were suppressed by SLE treatment. SLE also induced autophagy in LNCaP cells, and inhibition of autophagy enhanced the apoptosis induced by SLE treatment. These results suggest that SLE exerts anticancer effects through the induction of both cellular apoptosis and autophagy, and apoptotic cell death can be facilitated by blocking autophagy in SLE-treated LNCaP cells.

Methods:   Forty-two men aged 66 (7) years (incontinent [N = 19] and continent [N = 23]) who had undergone prostatectomy participated. Transperineal ultrasound imaging was used to record sagittal images of pelvic structures during involuntary coughing and sustained maximal voluntary contractions. Imaging data were analyzed to calculate displacements of pelvic floor landmarks associated with activation of the puborectalis, striated urethral sphincter, and bulbocavernosus muscles. Anatomical features of functional urethral length and the resting position of the ano-rectal and urethra-vesical junctions were calculated. A principal component analysis and multiple logistic regression were used to consider which combinations of variables best distinguish between men with and without incontinence.  Results:   Five principal components were identified that together explained 72.0% of the data. Two principal components that represented (i) striated urethral sphincter activation and (ii) bulbocavernosus and puborectalis muscle activation were significantly different between participants with and without incontinence. Together these components correctly identified 88.1% of incontinent men, with a specificity and sensitivity of 91.3% and 84.2%, respectively. Poor function of the bulbocavernosus and puborectalis muscles could be compensated by good striated urethral sphincter function, but the bulbocavernosus and puborectalis muscles had less potential to compensate for poor striated urethral sphincter function.

We previously showed that resistance to bicalutamide results from activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Interestingly, clinical trials testing combinations of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 with bicalutamide were effective in bicalutamide-naïve CRPC patients, but not in bicalutamide-pretreated ones. Here we investigate causes for their difference in response. Evaluation of CRPC cell lines identified resistant vs sensitive in vitro models, and revealed that increased eIF4E(S209) phosphorylation is associated with resistance to the combination. We confirmed using a human-derived tumor xenograft mouse model that bicalutamide pre-treatment is associated with an increase in eIF4E(S209) phosphorylation. Thus, AR suppressed eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) phosphorylation, while the use of antiandrogens relieved this suppression, thereby triggering its increase. Additional investigation in human prostatectomy samples showed that increased eIF4E phosphorylation strongly correlated with the cell proliferation marker Ki67. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown (k/d) of eIF4E-sensitized CRPC cells to RAD001+bicalutamide, whereas eIF4E overexpression induced resistance. Inhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation by treatment with CGP57380 (an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting serine-threonine kinases MAP kinase-interacting kinase 1 (Mnk1/2), the eIF4E upstream kinase) or inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), the upstream kinase-regulating Mnk1/2, also sensitized CRPC cells to RAD001+bicalutamide. Examination of downstream targets of eIF4E-mediated translation, including survivin, demonstrated that eIF4E(S209) phosphorylation increased cap-independent translation, whereas its inhibition restored cap-dependent translation, which could be inhibited by mTOR inhibitors. Thus, our results demonstrate that while combinations of AR and mTOR inhibitors were effective in suppressing tumor growth by inhibiting both AR-induced transcription and mTOR-induced cap-dependent translation, pre-treatment with AR antagonists including bicalutamide increased eIF4E phosphorylation that induced resistance to combinations of AR and mTOR inhibitors by inducing cap-independent translation.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) with serial tumor-propagating capacity are considered to be the driving force for PCa progression and recurrence. In this study, we report that the miR-302/367 cluster, a previously identified potent pluripotency regulator, is upregulated in prostate tumors. Specifically, the forced expression of the miR-302/367 cluster accelerates the in vitro and in vivo growth of PCa cells and their resistance to androgen ablation, whereas the knockdown of the miR-302/367 cluster using anti-sense RNA suppresses the incidence of formation, growth rate and endpoint weight of PCa cell tumors. Mechanistically, we find that LATS2, a key component of the tumor-suppressive Hippo signaling pathway, acts as a direct target of the miR-302/367 cluster in PCa cells. The downregulation of LATS2 by the miR-302/367 cluster reduces the phosphorylation and enhances the nuclear translocation of the YAP oncoprotein. Conversely, the restoration of LATS2 expression abrogates the tumor-promoting effects of forced miR-302/367 cluster expression.

Anethole, a major constituent of Foeniculum vulgare (fennel) essential oil, is widely used in folk medicine; it possesses anti-oxidant, antiinflammatory, anti-proliferative and tumoricidal potentialities.  Objective:   The current research was conducted to assess the impact of anethole on prostate cancer cell line, PC- 3, and to delineate the molecular mechanism of action.  Methods:   To achieve this aim, the growth-inhibitory effect of anethole was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptotic death and cell cycle analyses were assessed by flow cytometry and alterations in gene expression were investigated by qPCR and Western blot analyses.  Results:   The observations indicated that anethole inhibited proliferation, clonal growth and migration of PC-3 cells. It also suppressed growth of PC-3 derived cancer stem cells (tumorspheres). Pro-apoptotic potential of anethole was accompanied by generation of ROS, permeabilization of the mitochondrial and lysosomal membranes, activation of caspase-3 and -9, DNA damage, PARP cleavage and induction of Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio.

Syndecan-1, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, has been previously identified as a potential prognostic biomarker by multiple studies at the tissue and serum level. However, other studies have questioned its utility.  Methods:   Anti-Syndecan-1 immunohistochemistry was carried out on 157 prostate tissue samples (including cancerous, adjacent normal tissue, and non-diseased prostate) from three independent cohorts of patients. A population of Syndecan-1 positive stromal cells was identified and the number and morphological parameters of these cells quantified. The identity of the Syndecan-1-positive stromal cells was assessed by multiplex immunofluorescence using a range of common cell lineage markers. Finally, the burden of Syndecan-1 positive stromal cells was tested for association with clinical parameters.  Results:   We identified a previously unreported cell type which is marked by Syndecan-1 expression and is found in the stroma of prostate tumors and adjacent normal tissue but not in non-diseased prostate. We call these cells Prostate Cancer Syndecan-1 Positive (PCSP) cells. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the PCSP cell population did not co-stain with markers of common prostate epithelial, stromal, or immune cell populations. However, morphological analysis revealed that PCSP cells are often elongated and displayed prominent lamellipodia, suggesting they are an unidentified migratory cell population. Analysis of clinical parameters showed that PCSP cells were found with a frequency of 20-35% of all tumors evaluated, but were not present in non-diseased normal tissue. Interestingly, a subset of primary Gleason 5 prostate tumors had a high burden of PCSP cells.  Conclusions:   The current study identifies PCSP cells as a novel, potentially migratory cell type, which is marked by Syndecan-1 expression and is found in the stroma of prostate carcinomas, adjacent normal tissue, but not in non-diseased prostate. A subset of poor prognosis high Gleason grade 5 tumors had a particularly high PCSP cell burden, suggesting an association between this unidentified cell type and tumor aggressiveness.""","""['Benjamin Sharpe', 'Dhafer A Alghezi', 'Claire Cattermole', 'Mark Beresford', 'Rebecca Bowen', 'John Mitchard', 'Andrew D Chalmers']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Asporin is a stromally expressed marker associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Soluble syndecan-1 (SDC1) serum level as an independent pre-operative predictor of cancer-specific survival in prostate cancer.', 'Stromal PDGFRbeta expression in prostate tumors and non-malignant prostate tissue predicts prostate cancer survival.', 'Molecular and clinical profiles of syndecan-1 in solid and hematological cancer for prognosis and precision medicine.', 'Syndecan-1 in Cancer: Implications for Cell Signaling, Differentiation, and Prognostication.', 'Glycosylation Changes in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Syndecan Family Gene and Protein Expression and Their Prognostic Values for Prostate Cancer.', 'Syndecan-1 (CD138), Carcinomas and EMT.', 'Increased Cytoplasmic CD138 Expression Is Associated with Aggressive Characteristics in Prostate Cancer and Is an Independent Predictor for Biochemical Recurrence.', 'ADAMTS-15 Has a Tumor Suppressor Role in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The therapeutic peptide (CT20p) targets and inhibits the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) protein-folding complex, is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells, and is non-toxic to normal tissue. With the delivery of CT20p to prostate cancer cells via PSMA, a dual level of cancer specificity is achieved: (1) selective targeting to PSMA-expressing prostate tumors, and (2) specific cytotoxicity to cancer cells with minimal toxicity to normal cells. The PSMA-targeting theranostic nanocarrier can image PSMA-expressing cells and tumors when a near infrared dye is used as cargo. Meanwhile, it can be used to treat PSMA-expressing tumors when a therapeutic, such as the CT20p peptide, is encapsulated within the nanocarrier. Even when these PSMA-targeting nanocarriers are taken up by macrophages, minimal cell death is observed in these cells, in contrast with doxorubicin-based therapeutics that result in significant macrophage death. Incubation of PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells with the Folate-HBPE(CT20p) nanocarriers induces considerable changes in cell morphology, reduction in the levels of integrin β1, and lower cell adhesion, eventually resulting in cell death. These results are relevant as integrin β1 plays a key role in prostate cancer invasion and metastatic potential. In addition, the use of the developed PSMA-targeting nanocarrier facilitates the selective in vivo delivery of CT20p to PSMA-positive tumor, inducing significant reduction in tumor size.""","""['Orielyz Flores', 'Santimukul Santra', 'Charalambos Kaittanis', 'Rania Bassiouni', 'Amr S Khaled', 'Annette R Khaled', 'Jan Grimm', 'J Manuel Perez']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Development and characterization of a theranostic multimodal anti-PSMA targeting agent for imaging, surgical guidance, and targeted photodynamic therapy of PSMA-expressing tumors.', 'Discovery of PSMA-specific peptide ligands for targeted drug delivery.', '111In- and IRDye800CW-Labeled PLA-PEG Nanoparticle for Imaging Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Expressing Tissues.', 'Radiolabeled enzyme inhibitors and binding agents targeting PSMA: Effective theranostic tools for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Design of Chitosan-Coated, Quercetin-Loaded PLGA Nanoparticles for Enhanced PSMA-Specific Activity on LnCap Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'D2B-Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles: Promising Vehicles for Targeted Drug Delivery to Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Deep Tumor Penetration of Polymer Nanocarriers.', 'Chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT/TRiC) is a novel therapeutic and diagnostic target for neuroblastoma.', 'Chaperonin containing TCP1 as a marker for identification of circulating tumor cells in blood.']"""

Methods & materials:   Setup images of prostate cancer patients were acquired with two oblique X-ray fluoroscopic units. Two types of residual network were designed: a convolutional autoencoder (rCAE) and a convolutional neural network (rCNN). We changed the convolutional kernel size and number of convolutional layers for both networks, and the number of pooling and upsampling layers for rCAE. The ground-truth image was applied to the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) method of image processing. Network models were trained to keep the quality of the output image close to that of the ground-truth image from the input image without image processing. For image denoising evaluation, noisy input images were used for the training.  Results:   More than 6 convolutional layers with convolutional kernels >5×5 improved image quality. However, this did not allow real-time imaging. After applying a pair of pooling and upsampling layers to both networks, rCAEs with >3 convolutions each and rCNNs with >12 convolutions with a pair of pooling and upsampling layers achieved real-time processing at 30 frames per second (fps) with acceptable image quality.

However, the evaluation of post-implant CT dosimetry is not straightforward due to the edema that can modify the dose to the prostate and to the organs at risk. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the timing of the post-implant CT-scan on the dosimetric results and to verify if the Day 0 scan findings can predict Day 50 scanning.  Methods:   136 consecutive patients who received monotherapy with I-125 implants were selected for this study. Two sets of 8 dosimetric quality parameters corresponding to 2 different CT-scans (Day 0 and Day 50) were calculated and compared. The dosimetric parameters included are the percentage volume of the post-implant prostate receiving 80%, 100% and 150% of the prescribed dose, the doses covering 80% and 90% of the prostate volume and the Dose Homogeneity Index. The values of the dose covering 1cm3 of the rectum and urethra were assessed.  Results:   All the dosimetric parameters of the Day 50 were higher than those of the Day 0 scan. Linear functions were obtained that calculate D90 and V100 values at Day 50 based on the Day 0 findings. Rectal and urethral parameters tended to be underestimated on Day 0 CT-scan relative to Day 50 based dosimetry.

Materials and methods:   The cohort consisted of 1,379 consecutive male patients who were treated for androgenetic alopecia with finasteride 1.25 mg daily or dutasteride 0.5 mg every 3 days in 2002 to 2012 and who underwent prostate specific antigen measurements at baseline and at least once thereafter. Patients in whom baseline or followup prostate specific antigen after prescription exceeded 2.5 ng/ml were excluded from study to rule out men with a higher likelihood of prostate cancer. Patients were stratified according to age, baseline prostate specific antigen, medication type and treatment duration.  Results:   Overall low dose 5α-reductase inhibitor treatment reduced prostate specific antigen by 27.8% relative to baseline. Of the patients 1,094 (79.3%) showed prostate specific antigen decreases (average 40.8%). In the remaining 285 patients (20.7%) prostate specific antigen was stable or increased (average 24.2% increase). Closer analysis largely showed that only men with baseline prostate specific antigen 0.5 ng/ml or greater had a treatment related prostate specific antigen reduction. On multivariate logistic analysis low baseline prostate specific antigen was significantly associated with stable/increased prostate specific antigen. Low dose dutasteride and finasteride reduced prostate specific antigen to similar degrees (31.1% and 25.1%, respectively). A marked prostate specific antigen decrease of 26.0% was observed even after short-term treatment (3 to 6 months).  Conclusions:   Dutasteride and finasteride reduced prostate specific antigen to similar degrees. This effect was observed soon after commencing treatment. In patients with low baseline prostate specific antigen the levels could remain stable or even increase.

However, it remains unclear whether similar trends can also be observed in solely robotic practices, including nonreferral centers. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and pathological trends in robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) enrollment in Belgium over a period of 6 years through an analysis of a prospective registry.  Methods:   A prospective, multicenter database was constructed: consecutive patients undergoing RALP in Belgium from 2010 to 2015 were enrolled, and 7366 men were analyzed. Variations in clinical and pathological variables were explored as a function of the enrollment year with proportional odds for categorical variables and with linear regressions for continuous variables.  Results:   Net increases were observed in the prostate-specific antigen levels, cT stage, and biopsy Gleason scores across the study years (P < .001). The rate of low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) decreased from 36% in 2010 to 21% in 2015, whereas the rate of intermediate-risk PCa rose from 47% to 58%, and the rate of high-risk PCa rose from 17% to 21%. In parallel, the pT2 stage rate decreased from 76% to 64%, and the rate of Gleason 6 (3 + 3) cases was reduced from 45% to 23% (P < .001). Conversely, the pT3a stage rate rose from 16% to 24%, the pT3b stage rate rose from 7% to 11%, and the rate of Gleason 7 (4 + 3) cases rose from 7% to 21% (P < .0001). Finally, more patients underwent node dissection, and positive lymph nodes were increasingly diagnosed (from 3% in 2010 to 7% in 2015).  Conclusions:   During the last 6 years of RALP implementation in Belgium, there was a significant increase in the enrollment of intermediate- and high-risk PCa patients. This yielded a significant increase in adverse pathological characteristics. These results suggest a paradigm shift in PCa treatment, with radical robotic surgery increasing for intermediate- and high-risk patients.

In current clinical practice, uncertainties are accounted for implicitly with an expansion of the target volume according to generic margin recipes. Alternatively, it is possible to account for uncertainties by explicit minimization of objectives that describe worst-case treatment scenarios, the expectation value of the treatment or the coverage probability of the target volumes during treatment planning. In this note we show that approaches relying on objectives to induce a specific coverage of the clinical target volumes are inevitably sensitive to variation of the relative weighting of the objectives. To address this issue, we introduce coverage-based constraints for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning. Our implementation follows the concept of coverage-optimized planning that considers explicit error scenarios to calculate and optimize patient-specific probabilities [Formula: see text] of covering a specific target volume fraction [Formula: see text] with a certain dose [Formula: see text]. Using a constraint-based reformulation of coverage-based objectives we eliminate the trade-off between coverage and competing objectives during treatment planning. In-depth convergence tests including 324 treatment plan optimizations demonstrate the reliability of coverage-based constraints for varying levels of probability, dose and volume. General clinical applicability of coverage-based constraints is demonstrated for two cases. A sensitivity analysis regarding penalty variations within this planing study based on IMRT treatment planning using (1) coverage-based constraints, (2) coverage-based objectives, (3) probabilistic optimization, (4) robust optimization and (5) conventional margins illustrates the potential benefit of coverage-based constraints that do not require tedious adjustment of target volume objectives.""","""['H Mescher', 'S Ulrich', 'M Bangert']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Coverage optimized planning: probabilistic treatment planning based on dose coverage histogram criteria.', 'Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', ""Clinician's guide to prostate IMRT plan assessment and optimisation."", 'Probabilistic optimization of dose coverage in radiotherapy.', 'Novel adaptive beam-dependent margins for additional OAR sparing.']"""

In this study, we aim to determine if there is a difference in SL formation and characteristics between the two approaches.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who underwent eRARP or tRARP and BPLND by a single surgeon at a tertiary care academic center from July 1, 2003, to May 31, 2016. Patients with a history of prior pelvic radiotherapy, concomitant inguinal hernia repair, RARP without BPLND, or nonadenocarcinoma of the prostate were excluded. The resulting eRARP and tRARP groups were propensity matched for age, body mass index (BMI), American Association of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, D'Amico risk classification, and pathological lymph node (LN) count.  Results:   A total of 3183 RARPs were performed during this time period. After applying exclusion criteria and propensity score matching, 671 patients remained in each group. No statistically significant differences were noted between the groups with regard to age, BMI, ASA, pre-RARP prostate-specific antigen, D'Amico risk classification, biopsy and pathological Gleason sum score, pathological T stage, or margin status. The tRARP group had a higher clinical T stage (p = 0.0015), length of stay (LOS; p = 0.005), pathological N stage (4.92% vs 1.36%, p = 0.0002), and high total LN count (7.22 ± 5.54 vs 5.78 ± 4.18 LNs, p < 0.0001). The eRARP group had higher operating room times (197.4 ± 48.96 minutes vs 192.2 ± 44.12 minutes, p = 0.04) and estimated blood loss (218.4 ± 152.0 mL vs 179.9 ± 119.4 mL, p < 0.0001). No differences were noted in the frequency of SL formation [eRARP: 19/671 (2.83%) vs tRARP: 10/671 (1.49%), p = 0.09] or any clinical characteristics of the SL. Logistic regression analysis showed no effect of LN count (p = 0.071), pathological N stage (p = 0.111), or both combined (p = 0.085) on SL formation.  Conclusions:   In this cohort, the rate and clinical characteristics of SL were similar among patients treated with eRARP or tRARP and BPLND. The low event rate of SL in each group and trends favoring higher SL with LN yield and pN1 disease in the tRAPR group may deem the study underpowered to make definitive conclusions.""","""['David Horovitz', 'Xiang Lu', 'Changyong Feng', 'Edward M Messing', 'Jean V Joseph']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Extraperitoneal vs Transperitoneal Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy in the Setting of Prior Abdominal or Pelvic Surgery.', 'Extraperitoneal vs. transperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in patients with a history of prior inguinal hernia repair with mesh.', 'Surgeon-led prostate cancer lymph node staging: pathological outcomes stratified by robot-assisted dissection templates and patient selection.', 'Extraperitoneal Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Indications, Technique and Outcomes.', 'The role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection in the management of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Complications of extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in high-risk prostate cancer: A single high-volume center experience.', 'Risk factors for lymphorrhea and lymphocele after radical prostatectomy: a retrospective case-control study.', 'Occurrence of symptomatic lymphocele after open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'High BMI, Aggressive Tumours and Long Console Time Are Independent Predictive Factors for Symptomatic Lymphocele Formation after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy and Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection.', 'Rapid recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma at a lymphocele after nephroureterectomy: A rare case report.']"""

Our previous findings suggested a post-transcriptional regulation by the tumor-suppressive microRNA miR-138 in PCa. Thus, the aim of this study was to demonstrate the direct interaction of miR-138 with the 3'-UTR of AMACR. Furthermore, the influence of miR-138 on the expression of AMACR and selected AMACR regulators was investigated in PCa cells.  Methods:   Using DU-145, PC-3, and LNCaP PCa cells, the effect of exogenous miR-138 on AMACR and selected AMACR regulators was determined by quantitative PCR and Western blot. Luciferase reporter assays were used to verify target and promoter interaction.  Results:   Using a luciferase reporter assay a direct interaction of miR-138 with the AMACR-3'-UTR was confirmed. Surprisingly, AMACR expression was up-regulated by up to 125% by exogenous miR-138 in PCa cells. The lack of any miR-138 binding sites within the AMACR promoter suggested an indirect mechanism of up-regulation. Therefore, the effect of miR-138 on selected AMACR regulators including CTNNB1/β-catenin, RELA, SMAD4, SP1, and TCF4 was evaluated. MiR-138 solely evoked an up-regulation of CTNNB1 mRNA expression and β-catenin protein levels by up to 75%. Further in silico analysis revealed a binding site for miR-138 within the CTNNB1 promoter. MiR-138 could enhance the activity of the CTNNB1 promoter, which in turn could contribute to the observed AMACR up-regulation.  Conclusions:   The present findings suggest that miR-138 can indirectly up-regulate AMACR via transcriptional induction of CTNNB1, at least in vitro in PCa cells.""","""['Kati Erdmann', 'Knut Kaulke', 'Christiane Rieger', 'Manfred P Wirth', 'Susanne Fuessel']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['A nonclassic CCAAT enhancer element binding protein binding site contributes to alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase expression in prostate cancer.', 'alpha-Methylacyl-CoA racemase: expression levels of this novel cancer biomarker depend on tumor differentiation.', 'Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase as an androgen-independent growth modifier in prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic utility of alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S) on prostate needle biopsy.', 'Integrative analysis of aberrant Wnt signaling in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The role of miR-370 and miR-138 in the regulation of BMP2 suppressor gene expression in colorectal cancer: preliminary studies.', 'Pivotal role of microRNA-138 in human cancers.', 'Nuclear functions of mammalian MicroRNAs in gene regulation, immunity and cancer.']"""

In this work, an AIE-silica nanosphere (SiO2 NP)-based label-free fluorescent aptasensor for the sensitive ""turn-on"" detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is reported for the first time. The positively charged amino-functionalized SiO2 NPs were used as efficient nanocapturer to electrostatically adsorb single-stranded PSA aptamer (PA) to form SiO2 NP-PA nanocomposite as well as adsorb negatively charged tetraphenylethylene derivative 3 (TPE3) to form AIE-SiO2 NP nanocomposite. The binding of the aptamer to the target PSA could induce a rigid aptamer conformation, resulting in the release of the PA away from the surface of SiO2 NPs. This made the AIE molecules TPE3 aggregate on the SiO2 NP surface and emit high fluorescence. With the advantages of simple design and rapid responses, the proposed aptasensor showed high sensitivity and selectivity for PSA with a detection limit of 0.5 ng/mL. The aptasensor was further applied in human serum samples with satisfactory results. Given its versatility, high selectivity, and sensitivity, the proposed method could be extended to other targets by varying the recognition probes.

Although immunotherapies are approved for MIBC, the majority of patients fail to respond, suggesting existence of complementary immune evasion mechanisms. Here, we report that the PPARγ/RXRα pathway constitutes a tumor-intrinsic mechanism underlying immune evasion in MIBC. Recurrent mutations in RXRα at serine 427 (S427F/Y), through conformational activation of the PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer, and focal amplification/overexpression of PPARγ converge to modulate PPARγ/RXRα-dependent transcription programs. Immune cell-infiltration is controlled by activated PPARγ/RXRα that inhibits expression/secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Clinical data sets and an in vivo tumor model indicate that PPARγHigh/RXRαS427F/Y impairs CD8+ T-cell infiltration and confers partial resistance to immunotherapies. Knockdown of PPARγ or RXRα and pharmacological inhibition of PPARγ significantly increase cytokine expression suggesting therapeutic approaches to reviving immunosurveillance and sensitivity to immunotherapies.

There are two main types of primary lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 85-90% of all lung cancer cases, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which accounts for the other 10-15% of lung cancers. MiRNAs are small molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate many genes and contribute to many disease aetiologies, including tumours. In lung cancer, the down-regulation of miR-140-5p leads to disease progression.  Materials and methods:   In this study a miR-140-5p-only treatment and miR-140-5p combined with other chemotherapeutics have been studied in vitro.  Results:   When transfected into NSCLC, the overexpression of miR-140-5p reduced the migration and invasion properties of malignant cells and, also improved their adhesion onto the artificial extracellular matrix. When miRNA-140-5p replacement treatment was combined with other drugs commonly used in clinical practice, such as gefinitib, DMH1 and cisplatin, it enhanced their efficacy by reducing the migration and invasion ability of cancer cells, thus suggesting that it acts synergistically with known compounds for the treatment of NSCLC. Additionally, some endothelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers appeared to be regulated by miR-140-5p.  Conclusion:   Novel direct targets of miR-140-5p have not been investigated in this study, but our results indicate the involvement of miR-140-5p in lung cancer invasion.

Materials and methods:   We cultured and immortalized CAFs and NPFs, then compared their effect on epithelial malignant transformation by using in vitro co-culture, soft agar assay, and a mouse renal capsule xenograft model. We also compared their roles in PCa progression by using in vitro co-culture, cell viability assays, invasion assays, and a mouse xenograft model. For the mechanistic study, we screened a series of growth factors by using real-time polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   The CAFs and NPFs were successfully cultured, immortalized, and characterized. The CAFs were able to transform prostate epithelial cells into malignant cells, but NPFs were not. The CAFs were more active in promoting proliferation of and invasion by PCa cells, and in secreting higher levels of a series of growth factors.  Conclusion:   The immortalized CAFs were more supportive of PCa carcinogenesis and progression. Targeting CAFs might be a potential option for PCa therapy. Immortalized CAFs and NPFs will also be valuable resources for future experimental exploration.""","""['Shengqiang Yu', 'Yingjuan Jiang', 'Fengchun Wan', 'Jitao Wu', 'Zhenli Gao', 'Dongfu Liu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Androgen receptor in human prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts promotes prostate cancer epithelial cell growth and invasion.', 'A bioengineered microenvironment to quantitatively measure the tumorigenic properties of cancer-associated fibroblasts in human prostate cancer.', 'Differential influence of normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts on the growth of human epithelial cells in an in vitro cocultivation model of prostate cancer.', 'Role of miRNAs in cell signaling of cancer associated fibroblasts.', 'The roles of tumor- and metastasis-promoting carcinoma-associated fibroblasts in human carcinomas.', 'Cancer associated fibroblasts secreted exosomal miR-1290 contributes to prostate cancer cell growth and metastasis via targeting GSK3β.', 'The Role of Androgen Receptor in Cross Talk Between Stromal Cells and Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.', 'TRAIL-coated leukocytes to kill circulating tumor cells in the flowing blood from prostate cancer patients.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts stimulate primary tumor growth and metastatic spread in an orthotopic prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Nanoparticle Interactions with the Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Materials and methods:   PCA3 was overexpressed in a PC3 cell line (PC3PCA+) and cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were compared to those of control cells (PC3NC). Differentially expressed proteins were identified by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and mass spectrometry.  Results:   Overexpression of PCA3 significantly increased cell proliferation rate, migration and invasion, while inhibited apoptosis in PC3 cells. Three proteins were found down-regulated and 7 proteins up-regulated in PC3PCA+ cells compared to PC3NC cells, including GRP78. Higher GRP78 was also found in PCa clinical specimens.

They are characterised by a unique prevalence of osteoblastic phenotype and a poor prognosis. Paxillin is a 68-kDa signal transduction adaptor and scaffold protein that contains motifs involved in the mediation of protein-protein interactions. The state of paxillin phosphorylation is central to determining a cell's ability to adhere, detach and migrate and hence has been linked to processes such as wound repair and tumour metastasis. The current study explored the impact of paxillin suppression on prostate and breast cancer cell function and their responsiveness to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and bone matrix extract (BME) in order to assess its potential to influence bone colonization and homing.  Materials and methods:   Hammerhead ribozyme transgenes were used to knockdown the expression of paxillin in breast and prostate cancer cell lines. The impact on the cell growth, migration, adhesion and invasion was assessed using in vitro functional assays. In order to explore potential mechanisms, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor was also used.  Results:   Knockdown of paxillin expression was observed in all tested cell lines following transfection with the ribozyme transgene. The knockdown of paxillin increased proliferation and invasiveness of LNCaP cells, with no effect on their attachment abilities. The opposite, however, is true for PC-3 cells where, following knockdown, cellular attachment was significantly reduced, while no significant changes in growth and invasiveness were detected. In the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer knockdown model, cells had little difference in proliferative rates and generally increased attachment and reduced invasive abilities. Treatments with HGF and BME had differential effects on targeted cells when compared to controls.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that paxillin appears to influence major cell functions in a diverse range of prostate and breast cancer models. The responsiveness of cells to environmental factors such as HGF or BME may be influenced by paxillin status, although this seems to be dependent on cell type.""","""['Anna D Sobkowicz', 'Andrew J Sanders', 'Malcolm D Mason', 'Wen G Jiang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Metastasis to Bone in Human Cancer Is Associated with Loss of Occludin Expression.', 'Growth and differentiation factor-9 promotes adhesive and motile capacity of prostate cancer cells by up-regulating FAK and Paxillin via Smad dependent pathway.', 'The HGF/SF-induced phosphorylation of paxillin, matrix adhesion, and invasion of prostate cancer cells were suppressed by NK4, an HGF/SF variant.', 'Bone Metastasis: Molecular Mechanisms Implicated in Tumour Cell Dormancy in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Metastatic bone disease: role of transcription factors and future targets.', 'The Role of Paxillin Aberrant Expression in Cancer and Its Potential as a Target for Cancer Therapy.', 'Lack of Paxillin phosphorylation promotes single-cell migration in vivo.', 'Proteomic analysis of brain metastatic lung adenocarcinoma reveals intertumoral heterogeneity and specific alterations associated with the timing of brain metastases.', 'Chemoresistant ovarian cancer enhances its migration abilities by increasing store-operated Ca2+ entry-mediated turnover of focal adhesions.']"""

Material and methods:   Between October 2014 and April 2016, 60 men with a mean age of 64.1±6.7 (SD) years (range: 53-82 years) were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent a prostate MRI study, evaluated by two radiologists, before undergoing the biopsy. A transperineal 12-core SB was carried out before TB, without the information from the MRI. The detection rate for all tumors and for clinically significant tumors (CS) was recorded. Sampling variables such as the proportion of cores positive for CS cancer (PCP-CS) and the maximum cancer core length (MCCL) were also calculated. The ability of MRI to predict the presence of a CS tumor at biopsy was studied using a sector analysis. Patients with negative biopsies were followed during a minimum of 12 months.  Results:   The detection rate for SB and TB was 53.3% (32/60) and 46.7% (28/60) respectively for all tumors (P=0.289) and 45% (27/60) in both techniques for CS tumors. TB obtained a larger PCP-CS (P<0.001) and MCCL (P=0.018). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and cancer prevalence was 83.3%, 92.9%, 83.3%, 92.9% and 30% for peripheral zone sectors and 43.8%, 97.1%, 70.0%, 91.8% and 13,3% for transitional zone sectors. The proportion of patients that showed an increase of PSA faster than 0.75ng/mL/year after a negative biopsy was 26.1%.  Conclusion:   Detection rate of prostate cancer did not show significant differences between a TB and a SB technique in biopsy-naïve patients.

The aim of the current study was to assess bowel dose-volume relationships for acute patient-reported intestinal symptoms of patients treated with WPRT for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Complete data of 206 patients were available; the median dose to pelvic nodes was 51.8Gy (range 50.4-54.4, 1.7-2Gy/fr). Intestinal symptoms were assessed as changes in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire scores relative to the Bowel Domain (IBDQ-B) between baseline and radiotherapy mid-point/end. The 25th percentiles of the most severe worsening from baseline (ΔIBDQ-B) were set as end-points. The impact of bowel loops and sigmoid colon dose-volume/surface parameters as well as selected clinical parameters were investigated using multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   Analyses were focused on the four questions showing a median ΔIBDQ-B>0. No dose volume/surface parameters were predictive, other than ΔIBDQ5≥3 (loose stools): when grouping patients according to bowel DVHs (high risk: V20>470cc, V30>245cc, V42>110cc; low risk: all the remaining patients), a two-variable model including high-risk DVH-shape (OR: 9.3) and age (protective, OR: 0.94) was assessed. The model showed good calibration (slope: 1.003, R2=0.92) and was found to be robust after bootstrap-based internal validation.

Preliminary results of our centre""","""Introduction and objective:   There is growing interest in the use of more aggressive therapeutic modalities for treating metastatic prostate cancer. In this study, we examine the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for patients with oligorecurrent prostate cancer. We analysed the biochemical response and toxicity of patients who underwent this therapy at our centre.  Material and method:   We selected patients who experienced oligorecurrence between January 2015 to December 2016 and were administered SBRT. The association of androgen deprivation (AD) was left in each case to the decision of the tumour committee. We describe the clinical situation at diagnosis of oligorecurrence, the treatment administered and the biochemical response. We considered a biochemical response to be a 50% reduction in the absolute prostate-specific antigen (PSA) readings.  Results:   SBRT was administered to 11 patients with bone (82%) and/or lymph node oligometastasis (18%). The treatment regimen for bone oligometastasis was 27Gy divided into 3 sessions, while the treatment for lymph node oligometastasis reached 70Gy. Seven patients had no treatment at the time of diagnosis, 2 were in the castration-resistant phase, 1 patient was in the off phase of intermittent AD, and 1 patient had adjuvant AD for pN1. Seven patients presented a biochemical response with a PSA reduction of 75-100%. The response was not assessable in 4 patients due to the continuing adjuvant AD. With a mean follow-up of 10.5 months, only 2 patients had progressed. Grade 1 gastrointestinal toxicity was detected in only 1 patient.  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that the use of SBRT in carefully selected patients with metastatic oligorecurrence of prostate cancer can achieve biochemical response and potentially delay progression and the use of systemic treatments.""","""['C González Ruiz de León', 'M Ramírez Backhaus', 'M Sobrón Bustamante', 'J Casaña', 'L Arribas', 'J Rubio-Briones']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp""","""['Stereotactic body radiation therapy in patients with metachronous oligorecurrent prostate cancer: A single-center experience.', 'Prognostic factors, efficacy, and toxicity of involved-node stereotactic body radiation therapy for lymph node oligorecurrent prostate cancer : An investigation of 117 pelvic lymph nodes.', 'Salvage Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Isolated Lymph Node Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Single Institution Series of 94 Consecutive Patients and 124 Lymph Nodes.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Oligorecurrent prostate cancer: current management and perspectives.']"""

Cells were subjected to the treatment with different doses of 6 MeV electron radiation (0 2, 4 and 6 Gy), hyperthermia (at 43° C in 0, 30, 60 and 90 min) and radiation + hyperthermia (at 43 °C in 30 min with 2, 4 and 6 Gy dose), respectively. Twenty run-length matrix (RLM) features were extracted as descriptors for each selected region of interest for texture analysis. Linear discriminant analysis was employed to transform raw data to lower-dimensional spaces and increase discriminative power.

A distinct form of carcinoma showing synchronous dual exocrine and NE differentiation, termed amphicrine carcinoma, has been described at various other sites, primarily within the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological features of a series of metastatic prostate carcinoma (PCa) cases with amphicrine features.  Methods and results:   Five cases of high-grade PCa showing an amphicrine immunohistochemical phenotype were prospectively collected. The serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at diagnosis ranged from 38 ng/ml to 992 ng/ml (median 200 ng/ml). All five patients had metastatic disease, four at initial presentation. Microscopically, the tumours showed a solid/nested growth pattern composed of cells with amphophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, and macronucleoli. Morphological features of small-cell or large-cell NE carcinoma were absent. As compared with conventional high-grade PCa, the tumour cells showed a higher level of nuclear pleomorphism, brisk mitotic activity, and a high Ki67 proliferation index (median 50%). All cases showed immunohistochemical positivity for PSA, androgen receptor, and prostate-specific acid phosphatase, combined with diffuse or confluent/non-focal positivity for chromogranin-A and synaptophysin. Two hormone-naive cases showed a clinical response to androgen deprivation therapy.

Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) allows tumor visualization and corrects the errors caused by daily internal movement of the prostate. The current study retrospectively compared the acute toxicities and biochemical tumor control outcomes of prostate IMRT achieved using two IGRT techniques: bony structure-based IGRT (B-IGRT) and prostate-based IGRT (P-IGRT).  Methods:   Between February 2011 and July 2014, 96 patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer were treated using P-IGRT based on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT; 76 Gy) without fiducial markers. This group of patients was compared with a similar cohort of 96 patients who were treated with B-IGRT (74 Gy) between July 2007 and September 2011. The planning target volume (PTV) margins were 1-3 mm smaller in the P-IGRT group than in the B-IGRT group.  Results:   The median follow-up periods for all patients, the P-IGRT group, and the B-IGRT group were 42, 32, and 64 months, respectively. A significantly lower incidence of acute grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal toxicities was observed in the P-IGRT group compared with the B-IGRT group (3 vs. 11%; p = 0.049). The prostate-specific antigen failure-free survival rates at 3 years were 95.5 and 92.7% for the P-IGRT and B-IGRT groups, respectively (p = 0.534).  Conclusions:   IMRT with P-IGRT allows PTV margin reduction without sacrificing tumor control, which successfully reduces acute rectal toxicity compared with IMRT with B-IGRT.""","""['Kiyonao Nakamura', 'Takashi Mizowaki', 'Haruo Inokuchi', 'Itaru Ikeda', 'Takahiro Inoue', 'Tomomi Kamba', 'Osamu Ogawa', 'Masahiro Hiraoka']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Improved clinical outcomes with high-dose image guided radiotherapy compared with non-IGRT for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Long-term Outcomes of a Dose-reduction Trial to Decrease Late Gastrointestinal Toxicity in Patients with Prostate Cancer Receiving Soft Tissue-matched Image-guided Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy.', 'A Dosimetric Comparison between Conventional Fractionated and Hypofractionated Image-guided Radiation Therapies for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Exposure Risks Among Children Undergoing Radiation Therapy: Considerations in the Era of Image Guided Radiation Therapy.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiotherapy for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer: Trade-off between planning target volume margin and online plan adaption.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT): a review of clinical outcomes-what is the clinical evidence for the most effective implementation?', 'Analysis of the Influence of Peripheral Anatomical Changes for CBCT-Guided Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Semi-automated prediction approach of target shifts using machine learning with anatomical features between planning and pretreatment CT images in prostate radiotherapy.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

We tested the hypothesis that ADT will lead to changes in skeletal muscle gene expression, which may explain the adverse muscle phenotype seen clinically. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 9 men with localised prostate cancer who underwent a vastus lateralis biopsy before and after 4 weeks of ADT. Next-generation RNA sequencing was performed and genes differentially expressed following ADT underwent gene ontology mining using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Differential expression of genes of interest was confirmed by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) on gastrocnemius muscle of orchidectomised mice and sham controls (n=11/group). We found that in men, circulating total testosterone decreased from 16.5±4.3nmol/L at baseline to 0.4±0.15nmol/L post-ADT (p<0.001). RNA sequencing identified 19 differentially expressed genes post-ADT (all p<0.05 after adjusting for multiple testing). Gene ontology mining identified 8 genes to be of particular interest due to known roles in androgen-mediated signalling; ABCG1, ACTC1, ANKRD1, DMPK, THY1, DCLK1, CST3 were upregulated and SLC38A3 was downregulated post-ADT. Q-PCR in mouse gastrocnemius muscle confirmed that only one gene, Actc1 was concordantly upregulated (p<0.01) in orchidectomised mice compared with controls. In conclusion, given that ACTC1 upregulation is associated with improved muscle function in certain myopathies, we hypothesise that upregulation of ACTC1 may represent a compensatory response to ADT-induced muscle loss.

DLasiL showed highly potent (low nanomolar) antiproliferative activity against several human carcinoma cell lines including A2780 (ovarian), A549 (lung), MCF-7 (breast) and PC3 (prostate), and was as, or more, potent than the lectins ConBr (Canavalia brasiliensis), ConM (Canavalia maritima) and DSclerL (Dioclea sclerocarpa) against A2780 and PC3 cells. Interestingly, DLasiL lectin caused a G2/M arrest in A2780 cells after 24h exposure, activating caspase 9 and delaying the on-set of apoptosis. Confocal microscopy showed that fluorescently-labelled DLasiL localized around the nuclei of A2780 cells at lectin doses of 0.5-2× IC50 and gave rise to enlarged nuclei and spreading of the cells at high doses.

However, data for urological oncology procedures are limited. We examined PI rates after radical cystectomy (RC) according to the length of stay prior to RC (LOSPRC).  Materials and methods:   A total of 24,242 patients with bladder cancer treated with RC between 1998 and 2013 were abstracted from the National Inpatients Sample database. We evaluated changes over time in LOSPRC (0 vs. 1 vs. 2 days or more) and tested its effect on PI rates. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were adjusted for the year of surgery, sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, hospital location, teaching status, hospital surgical volume, and number of hospital beds.  Results:   Overall, 19,401 (80.0%), 3,990 (16.5%), and 851 (3.5%) individuals with LOSPRC of 0, 1. and 2 or more were identified. The proportion of LOSPRC 0 patients increased from 61.4% in 1998 to 91.0% in 2013 (P<0.001), whereas the opposite trend was observed for LOSPRC 1 and 2 or more. In multivariable logistic regression analyses predicting PIs, LOSPRC of 1 (odds ratio: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.25-1.53; P<0.001) and LOSPRC of 2 or more (odds ratio: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.81-2.55; P<0.001) achieved independent predictor status.

Their in vitro activities were evaluated against T. cruzi and a set of cells lines representative of human cancer conditions, namely ovarian, breast and prostate cancer. In T. cruzi, most of the complexes depicted IC50 values in the low μM range, induced changes of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. In cancer cells, complexes showed good to moderate activity and in metastatic cells (prostate PC3), some complexes inhibited the migratory ability, this suggesting that they display antimetastatic potential. Interestingly, complex 5 seemed to have a dual effect being the most cytotoxic complex on all cancer cells and also the most active anti-T-cruzi compound of the series.

Gains/amplifications of 8q24 are found associated with IMPC. Although the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) gene is located at chromosome 8q24, and found over-expressed in prior studies, its prognostic values and biological significance in IMPC have not been well studied.  Methods:   Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to assess the frequencies of PSCA copy number gains in IMPC, invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC-NST), and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) samples. The protein expression levels of PSCA were examined in 56 IMPC, 72 IDC-NST, and 56 ILC samples using immunohistochemical analysis.  Results:   PSCA gene amplification was detected in 45.2% (14/31) of the IMPC, 28.1% (9/32) of the IDC-NST, and none (0/25) of the ILC. PSCA protein expression was observed in 58.9% (33/56), 40.3% (29/72), and 3.6% (2/56) of IMPC, IDC-NST, and ILC samples, respectively. The concordant rate of the immunohistochemistry and FISH data was 85.2%. PSCA gene amplification highly correlated with its protein overexpression (rs = 0.687, P < 0.001), suggesting that gene amplification is an important mechanism involved in PSCA overexpression. Our univariate analysis showed that the patients with PSCA-positive IMPC had a decreased disease-free survival (DFS) compared to PSCA-negative IMPC patients (P = 0.003). Our multivariate analysis confirmed the worse DFS in PSCA-positive IMPC patients (P = 0.022).  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that PSCA may be an attractive target in the 8q24 amplicon and that it may serve as a molecular marker of metastasis and recurrence in IMPC. The differential expression of PSCA may be associated with cell adhesion. Detection of PSCA protein and gene amplification may help manage and predict the prognosis of IMPC patients.""","""['Fanfan Meng', 'Bingbing Liu', 'Gan Xie', 'Yawen Song', 'Xia Zheng', 'Xiaolong Qian', 'Shuai Li', 'Hongqin Jia', 'Xinmin Zhang', 'Lanjing Zhang', 'Yi-Ling Yang', 'Li Fu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['PSCA expression in invasive micropapillary carcinoma of breast.', 'Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast overexpresses MUC4 and is associated with poor outcome to adjuvant trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer.', 'Coamplification of prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) and MYC in locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Invasive Micropapillary Carcinoma of the Breast: An Update.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen: a Jekyll and Hyde molecule?', 'A rare case of invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast.', 'Cancer-Testis Antigens in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Role and Potential Utility in Clinical Practice.', 'Co-amplification of genes in chromosome 8q24: a robust prognostic marker in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'CD1d- and PJA2-related immune microenvironment differs between invasive breast carcinomas with and without a micropapillary feature.', 'Effect of exosome biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer patients.']"""

Cumulative incidences at 75 years (risks) for colorectal cancer were 46%, 43% and 15% in path_MLH1, path_MSH2 and path_MSH6 carriers; for endometrial cancer 43%, 57% and 46%; for ovarian cancer 10%, 17% and 13%; for upper gastrointestinal (gastric, duodenal, bile duct or pancreatic) cancers 21%, 10% and 7%; for urinary tract cancers 8%, 25% and 11%; for prostate cancer 17%, 32% and 18%; and for brain tumours 1%, 5% and 1%, respectively. Ovarian cancer occurred mainly premenopausally. By contrast, upper gastrointestinal, urinary tract and prostate cancers occurred predominantly at older ages. Overall 5-year survival for prostate cancer was 100%, urinary bladder 93%, ureter 85%, duodenum 67%, stomach 61%, bile duct 29%, brain 22% and pancreas 0%. Path_PMS2 carriers had lower risk for cancer.  Conclusion:   Carriers of different path_MMR variants exhibit distinct patterns of cancer risk and survival as they age. Risk estimates for counselling and planning of surveillance and treatment should be tailored to each patient's age, gender and path_MMR variant.

This effect is associated with weakening of the DNA damage response (DDR) normally supported by the androgen receptor. As a significant number of patients will fail combined ADT and radiotherapy, we hypothesized that DDR may be driven by androgen receptor splice variants (ARV) induced by ADT. Investigating this hypothesis, we found that ARVs increase the clonogenic survival of prostate cancer cells after irradiation in an ADT-independent manner. Notably, prostate cancer cell irradiation triggers binding of ARV to the catalytic subunit of the critical DNA repair kinase DNA-PK. Pharmacologic inhibition of DNA-PKc blocked this interaction, increased DNA damage, and elevated prostate cancer cell death after irradiation. Our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for therapeutic targeting of DNA-PK in the context of combined ADT and radiotherapy as a strategy to radiosensitize clinically localized prostate cancer.

The present study investigated the role of miR-2909 in the pathogenesis of PCa and the potential signalling pathways through which it operates. We have identified miR-2909 as a novel mediator of androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signalling that enhances the proliferation potential of PCa cells and assists in cancer survival under reduced androgen levels. Our results revealed that miR-2909 down regulates TGFBR2 by targeting its 3'-UTR sequence. We also observed that miR-2909 over-expression attenuated TGFβ-mediated SMAD3 activation, cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Moreover, miR-2909 modulated the expression of p21CIP, c-MYC and CCND1 through TGFβ signalling. Importantly, we also demonstrated that miR-2909 and AR regulates each other's expression resulting in a positive feedback loop. In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-2909 is an androgen-inducible miRNA that exerts its oncogenic effects by attenuating the tumor-suppressive effects of TGFβ signalling.""","""['Shiekh Gazalla Ayub', 'Deepak Kaul', 'Taha Ayub']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Androgen receptor and microRNA-21 axis downregulates transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGFBR2) expression in prostate cancer.', 'TGF-beta signaling and androgen receptor status determine apoptotic cross-talk in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation and methylation of tumor suppressor miR-124 by androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'The transcriptional regulation of miR-21, its multiple transcripts, and their implication in prostate cancer.', 'TGF-BETA IN THE NATURAL HISTORY OF PROSTATE CANCER.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.', 'Interaction between Non-Coding RNAs and Androgen Receptor with an Especial Focus on Prostate Cancer.', 'Pharmacoepigenomics circuits induced by a novel retinoid-polyamine conjugate in human immortalized keratinocytes.', 'MicroRNAs and Natural Compounds Mediated Regulation of TGF Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'TGF-β and microRNA Interplay in Genitourinary Cancers.']"""

Materials and methods:   A randomized (1:1), controlled, parallel group, nonblinded trial was performed in 4 regions of the United States. Eligible men had clinically localized prostate cancer and an upcoming consultation, and they spoke and read English or Spanish. Participants answered questionnaires to report decision making stage, personal characteristics, concerns and preferences plus baseline symptoms and decisional conflict. A randomization algorithm allocated participants to receive tailored education and communication coaching, generic teaching sheets and external websites plus a 1-page summary to clinicians (intervention) or the links plus materials provided in clinic (usual care). Conflict outcomes and the number of consultations were measured at 1 month. Univariate and multivariable models were used to analyze outcomes.  Results:   A total of 392 men were randomized, including 198 to intervention and 194 to usual care, of whom 152 and 153, respectively, returned 1-month outcomes. The mean ± SD 1-month decisional conflict scale (score range 0 to 100) was 10.9 ± 16.7 for intervention and 9.9 ± 18.0 for usual care. The multivariable model revealed significantly reduced conflict in the intervention group (-5.00, 95% CI -9.40--0.59). Other predictors of conflict included income, marital or partner status, decision status, number of consultations, clinical site and D'Amico risk classification.  Conclusions:   In this multicenter trial the decision aid significantly reduced decisional conflict.

For high-dose-rate (HDR)-BT, optimal fractionation remains under debate. The objective was to assess the clinical outcome of three schemes of HDR-BT boost.  Methods and materials:   Retrospective single institution data collection was performed. Patients received 46 Gy EBRT then an HDR-BT boost: 3 × 6 Gy, 2 × 9 Gy, or 1 × 14 Gy. HDR needles were placed under general anesthesia with endorectal ultrasonography guidance. CT-scan and treatment were performed postoperatively.  Results:   Between 2009 and 2012, 159 patients were included. Nine patients (5.7%) were low, 32 (20.1%) intermediate, and 118 (74.2%) high risk (D'Amico classification) without significant difference between the three BT schemes. With a median followup of 61 months, 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival, 5-year local relapse-free survival, 5-year metastases-free survival, and 5-year overall survival rates were 86.6% (SE 2.7%), 98.3% (SE 1%), 95.3% (SE 1%), and 96.5% (SE 1.5%), respectively, with no significant difference between the BT schemes. The rates of acute ≥ G2 genitourinary and ≥G2 gastrointestinal toxicities were 11.3% and 6.3%, respectively (p = NS). The rates of late genitourinary ≥ G2 and gastrointestinal ≥ G2 toxicities (at last followup) were 9.4% and 0.6% with, respectively, 0.6% and 0% of G4 (p = NS).

We used data from the 18 population- based tumor registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) 2004-2013 database to study trends in the incidence of metastatic PCa among men stratified by age and race. Joinpoint regression analyses were performed to identify time points associated with any statistically significant change in incidence. Overall, there was a significant increase in incidence between 2009 and 2013 (annual percentage change [APC] 3.10%; p<0.05). In age-stratified analyses, there was a continuous increase in the incidence of metastatic PCa from 2004 to 2013 among men aged 45-54 yr and 55-64 yr (APC 1.77% and 1.43% respectively; both p<0.05). For men aged ≥75 yr there was a significant decline in the incidence of metastatic PCa from 2004 to 2011 (APC -2.07%; p<0.05) and a nonsignificant increase from 2011 onwards (APC 6.09%). Distinct incidence trends were noted for white and black men. While it is too early to presume that the recent decline in PSA screening secondary to the USPSTF statement is causally associated with our findings, our results highlight a concerning trend of increasing metastatic disease. Our results thus warrant validation in future longer-term studies on the contemporary incidence and mortality of metastatic PCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: We noted increasing incidence of metastatic prostate cancer from 2009 onwards among US men (especially those aged 45-74 yr) in a population-based tumor registry. Pending validation in longer-term studies, our results suggest the need for close surveillance of trends for metastatic prostate cancer incidence and mortality.""","""['Deepansh Dalela', 'Maxine Sun', 'Mireya Diaz', 'Patrick Karabon', 'Thomas Seisen', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Mani Menon', 'Firas Abdollah']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Past, Current, and Future Incidence Rates and Burden of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the United States.', 'Changing Incidence of Metastatic Prostate Cancer by Race and Age, 1988-2015.', 'Rates and trends in stage-specific prostate cancer incidence by age and race/ethnicity, 2000-2017.', ""Impact of the United States Preventive Services Task Force 'D' recommendation on prostate cancer screening and staging."", 'Metastatic prostate cancer incidence in Australia after amendment to prostate-specific antigen screening guidelines.', 'Clinical Features and Body Composition in Men with Hormone-Sensitive Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Pilot Study Examining Differences by Race.', 'Association of the USPSTF Grade D Recommendation Against Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening With Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', 'Baseline basophil and basophil-to-lymphocyte status is associated with clinical outcomes in metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Outcomes and Racial Disparities in Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer in the Era of Novel Treatment Options.', 'Volume matters and intensification is needed: emerging trends in the management of advanced prostate cancer.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective study involving a cohort of 611 consecutive patients referred for transrectal prostate biopsy following suspicion of PCa. PHS-TT guided cores were obtained from up to three PHS lesions of ≥0.5cm3 per prostate and only one core per single PHS lesion. Histological outcomes from a systematic extended 12-core biopsy (Bx) scheme and additional PHS-TT guided cores were compared.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Comparison of PHS results and histopathology was performed per sextant. The χ2 and Mann-Whitney test were used to assess differences. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.  Results and limitations:   PHS showed lesions of ≥0.5cm3 in 312 out of the 611 patients recruited. In this group, Bx detected PCa in 59% (185/312) and PHS-TT in 87% (270/312; p<0.001). The detection rate was 25% (944/3744 cores) for Bx and 68% (387/573 cores) for PHS-TT (p<0.001). Preclinical assessment was significantly better when using PHS-TT: Bx found 18.6% (58/312) and 8.3% (26/312), while PHS-TT found 42.3% (132/312) and 20.8% (65/312) of Gleason 7 and 8 cases, respectively (p<0.001).

Design, setting, and participants:   Patients were identified retrospectively from a single UK centre between October 2010 and January 2015. Patients were included if they had a Likert score of 3/5 on a first MRI scan without any prior prostate biopsy. Patients were offered one of two initial management strategies. Strategy 1 was an immediate targeted biopsy of the MRI lesion. Strategy 2 was a surveillance process comprising prostate-specific antigen monitoring and/or mp-MRI at intervals of 6-12 mo, with biopsy on a for-cause basis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cancer detection and treatment outcomes were compared for the two strategies.  Results and limitations:   Of 168 patients, 73 (43%) chose strategy 1 and 95 (57%) chose strategy two. The overall proportion of men with clinically significant cancer detected was 14% (23/168). The risk profile for cancer identified in the initial surveillance group was similar to that identified in the immediate biopsy group. Limitations of the study include the short follow-up.  Conclusions:   Men with indeterminate mp-MRI were willing to forego immediate biopsy for a strategy of surveillance involving PSA measurement and/or mp-MRI repeated at intervals. The risk profile of the cancers identified by both strategies appeared similar, but many men in the surveillance group avoided the risks, complications, and costs of biopsy. Long-term results are awaited.

Objective:   To determine whether statin use affects survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with abiraterone.  Design, setting, and participants:   Medical records of patients with documented mCRPC between September 2011 and August 2016 were reviewed at multiple participating centers. This research was conducted in ten institutions, including both referral centers and local hospitals. A total of 187 patients receiving abiraterone for mCRPC between September 2011 and August 2016 were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective study.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients were assessed for overall survival (OS), statin use at the time of treatment initiation, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) variations, and other variables of interest. Univariable and multivariable analysis was used to explore the association of variables of interest with OS and PSA declines.  Results and limitations:   Statin use was a significant prognostic factor for longer OS in univariable (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.72; p<0.001) and multivariable analysis (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.27-0.59; p<0.001) and was significantly associated with PSA declines (>50% decline at 12 wk: 72.1% in statin users vs 38.5% in non-users; p<0.001).  Conclusions:   Our study suggests a prognostic impact of statin use in patients receiving abiraterone for mCRPC. The mechanism of this interaction warrants elucidation, but may include enhancement of the antitumor activity of abiraterone as well as cardioprotective effects.

Results from a Prospective Case-Control Study""","""The impact of cytoreductive radical prostatectomy (CRP) on oncological outcomes in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) and distant metastases has been demonstrated by retrospective data with their potential selection bias. Using prospective institutional data, we compared the outcomes between 43 PCa patients with low-volume bone metastases (1-3 lesions) undergoing CRP (median follow-up 32.7 mo) and 40 patients receiving best systemic therapy (BST; median follow-up 82.2 mo). The inclusion criteria for both cohorts were identical. So far, no significant difference in castration resistant-free survival (p=0.92) or overall survival (p=0.25) has been detected. Compared to recent reports, the outcomes for our control group are more favorable, indicating a potential selection bias in the previous retrospective studies. Therefore, the unclear oncological effect has to be weighed against the potential risks of CRP. However, patients benefit from a significant reduction in locoregional complications (7.0% vs 35%; p<0.01) when undergoing CRP.  Patient summary:   In this study we analyzed the impact of surgery in patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases.

TERT promoter mutations have been recently implicated in urothelial carcinogenesis.  Objective:   To investigate the degree to which TERT promoter mutations are involved in SCC of the urinary bladder, the linked tumorigenesis between urothelial carcinoma and SCC of the urinary bladder, and the molecular distinctions between SCC of the urinary bladder and of the prostate.  Design, setting, and participants:   We investigated TERT promoter mutations in 53 cases of SCC of the urinary bladder and in 26 cases of SCC of the prostate using laboratory-based studies of tissue samples and clinical data.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We measured the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in SCCs of the urinary bladder and prostate, and concordance of the mutation status between concurrent urinary bladder SCC and urothelial carcinoma.  Results and limitations:   TERT promoter mutations were detected in 29/53 (55%) cases of urinary bladder and 0/26 (0%) cases of prostate SCC. Of 25 cases with concurrent urinary bladder SCC and non-small-cell components, all cases harbored identical TERT promoter mutation status in both phenotypes.  Conclusions:   TERT promoter mutations are found in more than half of urinary bladder SCCs. Mutation status is also identical in urothelial carcinoma and SCC components of concomitant malignancies, providing evidence of a common clonality. TERT promoter mutation status can differentiate SCC of the urinary bladder from prostate SCC, suggesting potential diagnostic use.  Patient summary:   Small-cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder shares a common clonal origin with conventional urothelial carcinoma and may arise from a heterogeneous subclone.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce inflammation and also PSA elevations due to intraprostatic inflammation.  Objective:   To explore whether NSAID usage modifies the effects of PSA-based screening on prostate cancer incidence and mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cohort of 78 165 men from the FinRSPC were linked to a comprehensive national prescription database to obtain information on NSAID reimbursements prior to screening.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Prostate cancer risk and mortality were compared between the FinRSPC screening arm and the control arm among NSAID users and nonusers using an age-adjusted Cox regression model.  Results and limitations:   Screening increased the detection of Gleason 6 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.47-1.72 and HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.26-1.54) and localized prostate tumors (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.18-1.32 and HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03-1.20) more among baseline NSAID nonusers than among users, respectively (p for interaction <0.04 for both). This difference was observed in all three screening rounds. Detection of metastatic prostate cancer was similar in both NSAID users and nonusers. Screening decreased prostate cancer mortality among men using NSAIDs at FinRSPC randomization (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.90) but not among nonusers (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81-1.12); p for interaction=0.04.  Conclusions:   Screening detected fewer well-differentiated localized tumors among NSAID users than among nonusers. This suggests that PSA screening may cause less overdiagnosis within this subgroup, whereas mortality benefit may be greater among NSAID users.

Objective:   To study the role of ERG and PTEN status in the Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) trial diagnostic biopsies (DBxs) in predicting surveillance discontinuation and adverse surgical findings in subsequent radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 231 patients were recruited to the PRIAS between 2007 and 2013 in Helsinki. DBx tissue for immunohistochemistry (IHC) was available from 190 patients. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed from 57 specimens of subsequent RPs. DBxs containing grade group (GG) 1 PCa and RP TMA sections were stained with ERG and PTEN antibodies, and scored as either negative or positive.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Outcomes were followed up by biopsy GG upgrade (GG ≥ 2) and protocol-based treatment change, as well as adverse findings in RP (GG ≥ 3 or pathological stage≥3). Clinical variables and biomarker status in DBx were correlated in Cox regression analysis and cumulative survival in Kaplan-Meier analysis, and finally, Gray's competing risk analysis was performed and nonprotocol-based discontinuation was considered as a competing event.  Results and limitations:   In both uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses, only the number of positive cores in the DBx, the number of rebiopsy sessions, and PTEN status at diagnosis were significantly associated with rebiopsy GG upgrade, treatment change, and adverse histopathology in RP. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, PTEN loss was associated with a shorter time to GG upgrade and treatment change. Patients with PTEN loss had a higher probability for protocol-based discontinuation but not for competing risk factors compared with patients with intact PTEN. Biopsy ERG status was concordant with RP TMA ERG status, while PTEN was not. Limitations include a retrospective analysis of prospective cohort data.  Conclusions:   PTEN status at diagnosis is a potential biomarker for identifying patients with PCa on AS with a high risk for progression or adverse findings on subsequent RP.

Objective:   To train and validate urine-based microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers that may assist in PC diagnosis and prognosis.  Design, setting, and participants:   We profiled the expression levels of 92 miRNAs via reverse transcriptase-poymerase chain reaction in cell-free urine samples from 29 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 215 patients with clinically localized PC (cohort 1). Our findings were validated in an independent cohort of 29 BPH patients and 220 patients with clinically localized PC (cohort 2).  Results and limitations:   We identified and validated several deregulated miRNAs in urine samples from PC patients. In addition, we trained a novel diagnostic three-miRNA model (miR-222-3p*miR-24-3p/miR-30c-5p) that distinguished BPH and PC patients with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 in cohort 1, and was successfully validated in cohort 2 (AUC 0.89).

Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective cohort study of CA and AA CaP patients enrolled at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, who donated clinically annotated, whole-mounted, prostatectomy specimens between 1994 and 2014 following RP, was conducted.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimation curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine time to BCR as a function of ERG status, patient race, and obesity.  Results and limitations:   Among 930 eligible patients (36.1% AA and 63.9% CA), with 155 (16.7%) BCR events and a median follow-up time of 5.1 yr, ERG oncoprotein expression was significantly less prevalent in index tumors of AA versus CA patients (23.2% vs 49.3%; p<0.0001). KM curves showed significantly poorer BCR-free survival for CA patients with ERG-negative index tumors but not for AA patients. Race-stratified multivariable analyses revealed a significant association between ERG-negative index tumors and poorer BCR-free survival among CA patients (hazards ratio=1.67, confidence interval=1.07, 2.61; p=0.024). Less heterogeneity in ERG expression among AA patients may reduce the ability to show its association with BCR.  Conclusions:   Striking racial variation in ERG oncoprotein expression was confirmed.

We evaluated the metabolic response for each individual metastatic lesion (n=165) in 15 patients with metastatic PCa who underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography before and at least 3 mo after initiation of a systemic therapy that did not change in that period. Intermetastasis heterogeneity was defined as opposite metabolic responses for at least two metastases from the same compartment (bone or soft tissue) between the two time points. We found intrapatient intermetastasis response heterogeneity in 40% of the cases in our retrospective series. Our results suggest that systemic therapies can induce heterogeneous responses among individual metastases in patients with PCa, supporting the polyclonal evolution of PCa in advanced disease. Molecular imaging may thus be useful in identifying clinical resistance early after therapy initiation and could also allow targeted biopsy of resistant clones for molecular analysis.

Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards models were performed controlling for known predictors of CRPC. PPFV was shown to be independent of all included factors, and the most significant predictor of time to CRPC. Using our multivariate model consisting of all known factors prior to ADT, PPFV significantly improved the area under the curve of the multivariate models receiver operating characteristic analysis. The main study limitation is a relatively small cohort to account for multiple variables, necessitating a future large-scale prospective analysis of PPFV in advanced PC.

Design, setting, and participants:   In the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare-linked database, we identified 14 785 octo- and nonagenarian organ-confined PCa patients treated with PADT between 1991 and 2009.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The smoothed cumulative incidence method was used to examine 10-yr overall mortality, cancer-specific mortality (CSM), and other-cause mortality (OCM) rates. Multivariable Cox regression analyses focused on the combined effect of age and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) after adjusting for different confounders.  Results and limitations:   Of all the deaths observed during the study period, 80% were due to non-cancer causes and 20% were due to PCa. The 10-yr overall survival (OS) rate in the overall population was 15.4%. The 10-yr OS rates ranged from 19.9% in patients aged 80-84 yr to 3.1% in those aged ≥90 yr. Similarly, the 10-yr OS rates ranged from 18.7% in patients with CCI=0 to 11.5% in those with CCI≥2. The 10-yr OCM rate in the overall population was 68.2%. The 10-yr OCM rates ranged from 64.6% in patients aged 80-84 yr to 77.2% in patients aged ≥90 yr. Similarly, the 10-yr OCM rates ranged from 62.1% in patients with CCI=0 to 75.2% in those with CCI≥2. The 10-yr CSM rate in the overall population was 16.4%. The 10-yr CSM rates ranged from 15.5% in patients aged 80-84 yr to 19.7% in those aged ≥90 yr, and from 19.2% in patients with CCI=0 to 13.3% in those with CCI≥2.  Conclusions:   Of the elderly patients with organ-confined PCa exposed to PADT, only 15% survive at 10-yr follow-up. Mortality related to non-cancer causes is the leading cause of death in the same follow-up period. These figures question the rationale for PADT in elderly men with organ-confined PCa.  Patient summary:   In this study, we looked at the survival patterns of octo- and nonagenarians treated with primary androgen deprivation therapy for organ-confined prostate cancer. We found that a small proportion of patients who received primary androgen deprivation therapy remain alive at 10-yr follow-up, and the leading cause of death was not attributable to prostate cancer.""","""[""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Mohamed Bishr', 'Katharina Boehm', 'Vincent Trudeau', 'Alessandro Larcher', 'Zhe Tian', 'Josè Sosa', 'Marco Moschini', 'Fred Saad', 'Umberto Capitanio', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Markus Graefen', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Patterns of Declining Use and the Adverse Effect of Primary Androgen Deprivation on All-cause Mortality in Elderly Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy as primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: data from Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor (CaPSURE).', 'The role of primary androgen deprivation therapy in localized prostate cancer.', 'Global update on defining and treating high-risk localized prostate cancer with leuprorelin: a Japanese perspective--the effect of primary androgen deprivation therapy on stage C prostate cancer.', 'Relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of methods of androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Urological outcomes in nonagenarians with prostate cancer.']"""

Accurate prediction of individual cancer behaviour is therefore not achievable at the time of diagnosis leading to substantial overtreatment. It remains an enigma that, in contrast to breast cancer, unsupervised analyses of global expression profiles have not currently defined robust categories of prostate cancer with distinct clinical outcomes.  Objective:   To devise a novel classification framework for human prostate cancer based on unsupervised mathematical approaches.  Design, setting, and participants:   Our analyses are based on the hypothesis that previous attempts to classify prostate cancer have been unsuccessful because individual samples of prostate cancer frequently have heterogeneous compositions. To address this issue, we applied an unsupervised Bayesian procedure called Latent Process Decomposition to four independent prostate cancer transcriptome datasets obtained using samples from prostatectomy patients and containing between 78 and 182 participants.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Biochemical failure was assessed using log-rank analysis and Cox regression analysis.  Results and limitations:   Application of Latent Process Decomposition identified a common process in all four independent datasets examined. Cancers assigned to this process (designated DESNT cancers) are characterized by low expression of a core set of 45 genes, many encoding proteins involved in the cytoskeleton machinery, ion transport, and cell adhesion. For the three datasets with linked prostate-specific antigen failure data following prostatectomy, patients with DESNT cancer exhibited poor outcome relative to other patients (p=2.65×10-5, p=4.28×10-5, and p=2.98×10-8). When these three datasets were combined the independent predictive value of DESNT membership was p=1.61×10-7 compared with p=1.00×10-5 for Gleason sum. A limitation of the study is that only prediction of prostate-specific antigen failure was examined.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate the existence of a novel poor prognosis category of human prostate cancer and will assist in the targeting of therapy, helping avoid treatment-associated morbidity in men with indolent disease.  Patient summary:   Prostate cancer, unlike breast cancer, does not have a robust classification framework. We propose that this failure has occurred because prostate cancer samples selected for analysis frequently have heterozygous compositions (individual samples are made up of many different parts that each have different characteristics). Applying a mathematical approach that can overcome this problem we identify a novel poor prognosis category of human prostate cancer called DESNT.""","""['Bogdan-Alexandru Luca', 'Daniel S Brewer', 'Dylan R Edwards', 'Sandra Edwards', 'Hayley C Whitaker', 'Sue Merson', 'Nening Dennis', 'Rosalin A Cooper', 'Steven Hazell', 'Anne Y Warren;CancerMap Group;Rosalind Eeles', 'Andy G Lynch', 'Helen Ross-Adams', 'Alastair D Lamb', 'David E Neal', 'Krishna Sethia', 'Robert D Mills', 'Richard Y Ball', 'Helen Curley', 'Jeremy Clark', 'Vincent Moulton', 'Colin S Cooper']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['A novel stratification framework for predicting outcome in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Convergence of Prognostic Gene Signatures Suggests Underlying Mechanisms of Human Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'PSA doubling time as a predictor of clinical progression after biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Tumor immune contexture predicts recurrence after prostatectomy and efficacy of androgen deprivation and immunotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Combining Molecular Subtypes with Multivariable Clinical Models Has the Potential to Improve Prediction of Treatment Outcomes in Prostate Cancer at Diagnosis.', 'SR9009 inhibits lethal prostate cancer subtype 1 by regulating the LXRα/FOXM1 pathway independently of REV-ERBs.', 'Validation of diagnostic nomograms based on CE-MS urinary biomarkers to detect clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Integration of Urinary EN2 Protein & Cell-Free RNA Data in the Development of a Multivariable Risk Model for the Detection of Prostate Cancer Prior to Biopsy.']"""

Objective:   To determine the antitumour activity and safety profile of extended treatment with ODM-201 in men with mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   ARADES and ARAFOR trials with ODM-201 enrolled chemotherapy-naïve and CYP17 inhibitor (CYP17i)-naïve mCRPC patients. Both trials had extended follow-up. Here we report results for chemotherapy-naïve and CYP17i-naïve patients from both trials (data cutoff October 2014 for ARADES and April 2015 for ARAFOR) after extended follow-up.  Intervention:   A total of 41 chemotherapy-naïve and CYP17i-naïve patients received oral ODM-201 twice daily (total daily dose of 1200, 1400 or 1800mg).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Antitumour activity was assessed in terms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declines and PSA/radiographic progression. Safety was assessed until disease progression and/or drug discontinuation due to any intolerable adverse event (AE).  Results and limitations:   ODM-201 safety data after a median treatment time of 13.5 mo (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.7-15.6, interquartile range [IQR] 7.5-22.0) were similar to those reported in the main ARADES and ARAFOR trials. The overall AE incidence was 80.5% (n=33/41), with 58.5% (n=24/41) of patients experiencing only grade 1-2 AEs. The most common AEs were fatigue, back pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and pain in extremity. The median times to PSA and radiological progression were 12.4 mo (95% CI 6.3-18.2, IQR 5.5-22.0) and 15.3 mo (95% CI 9.5-not reached [NR], IQR 6.3-NR), respectively.  Conclusions:   Extended treatment with ODM-201 (1200-1800mg/d) was well tolerated, with no new safety concerns, and provided evidence of sustained antitumour activity in chemotherapy-naïve and CYP17i-naïve patients with mCRPC.

Objective:   To evaluate the safety and antitumour activity of prolonged ODM-201 treatment in patients with CRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   The ARADES trial was a multicentre phase 1 (dose escalation) and phase 2 (dose expansion) trial; 134 patients with CRPC were stratified by previous chemotherapy to receive ODM-201. This paper reports extended follow-up in CYP17 inhibitor (CYP17i)-naïve patients.  Intervention:   Patients (n=77) received oral ODM-201 twice daily at daily doses of 200-1800mg.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Safety, measured as the occurrence of adverse events (AEs), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and radiographic progression.  Results and limitations:   The safety profile of extended ODM-201 treatment (median treatment duration 8.2 mo, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6-11.0) was consistent with that reported at the time of the original data cutoff in the main ARADES trial, with no unexpected safety concerns over time. The majority of AEs (61.1%) were mild (grade 1); the most common AE was fatigue/asthenia (35.1% of patients), with no clear relationship to ODM-201. Median time to PSA progression was 25.2 mo (95% CI 11.3-25.2) for chemotherapy-naïve men and not reached (NR; 95% CI 5.5-NR) for chemotherapy-pretreated patients; a trend for improved antitumour response was observed for chemotherapy-naïve patients.

Objective:   To investigate the influence of somatic mutation count (MC) and copy number variation (CNV) on pathologic and oncologic outcomes in patients with genitourinary malignancies in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  Design, setting, and participants:   TCGA data sets for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC; KICH), clear cell RCC (KIRC), papillary RCC (KIRP), pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and testis germ cell tumor (TGCT) were accessed via cBioportal.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Median MC and CNV were compared among and within each tumor type. Patients were stratified by grade and stage, and differences in MC and CNV were compared. Correlation of MC and CNV with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was analyzed when these data were available.  Results and limitations:   Among the tumor types analyzed, BLCA had the highest MC at 167, followed by ACC (89), KIRP (71), TGCT (55), KIRC (45), PRAD (34), PCPG (14), and KICH (12). The tumor type with the highest fraction of the genome with CNV was KICH (0.94), followed by ACC (0.58), TGCT (0.41), BLCA (0.29), KIRP (0.15), PCPG (0.13), KIRC (0.12), and PRAD (0.06).

CNV was associated with higher N stage in PRAD, grade in KIRC, and Gleason grade in PRAD. In addition, higher CNV was independently associated with inferior RFS for KIRC, as well as inferior OS and RFS for KIRP.  Conclusions:   MC and CNV vary greatly among tumor types.

Objective:   We connect imaging with high-precision spatial annotation of biopsies and genomic cancer signatures to compare the genomic signals of the index lesion and biopsy cores of adjacent and far away locations.  Design, setting, and participants:   Eleven patients diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer on MRI/transrectal ultrasound-fusion biopsy (Bx) and treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). Five tissue specimens were collected from each patient.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Whole transcriptome RNA-expression was profiled for each sample. Genomic signatures were used to compare signals in MRI invisible versus visible foci using Pearson's correlation and to assess intratumoral heterogeneity using hierarchical clustering.  Results and limitations:   Ten RP and 27 Bx-samples passed quality control. Gene expression between RP and index Bx, but not adjacent benign samples, was highly correlated. Genomic Gleason grade classifier features measured across the different samples showed concordant expression across Bx and RP tumor samples, while an inverse expression pattern was observed between tumor and benign samples indicating the lack of a strong field-effect. The distribution of low and high Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) samples was 10 and 11, respectively. Genomics of all low PI-RADS samples resembled benign tissue and most high PI-RADS samples resembled cancer tissue. A strong association was observed between PI-RADS version 2 and Decipher as well as the genomic Gleason grade classifier score. Clustering analysis showed that most samples cluster tightly by patient. One patient showed unique tumor biology in index versus secondary lesion suggesting the presence of intrapatient heterogeneity and the utility in profiling multiple foci identified by MRI.  Conclusions:   MRI-targeted Bx-genomics show excellent correlation with RP-genomics and confirm the information captured by PI-RADS. Sampling of the target lesion must be precise as correlation between index and benign lesions was not seen.

There is a lack of tools to predict prostate cancer-related death (PCRD) in patients with high-risk features.  Objective:   To develop and validate a prognostic model that predicts PCRD combining pathologic features and using competing-risks analysis.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a retrospective multi-institutional observational cohort study of 5876 patients affected by high-risk prostate cancer. Patients were treated using RP and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) in a multimodal setting, with median follow-up of 49 mo.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   For PCRD prediction, a multivariate model with correction for competing risks was constructed to evaluate pathologic high-risk features (pT3b-4, Gleason score ≥8, and pN1) as predictors of mortality. All possible associations of the predictors were combined, and then subgroups with similar risk of PCRD were collapsed to obtain a simplified model encoding subgroups with significantly differing risk. Eightfold cross-validation of the model was performed.  Results and limitations:   After applying exclusion criteria, 2823 subjects were identified. pT3b-4, Gleason score ≥8, and pN1 were all independent predictors of PCRD. The simplified model included the following prognostic groups: good prognosis, pN0 with 0-1 additional predictors; intermediate prognosis, pN1 with 0-1 additional predictors; poor prognosis, any pN with two additional predictors. The cross-validation yielded excellent median model accuracy of 88%. The retrospective design and the short follow-up could limit our findings.  Conclusions:   We developed and validated a novel and easy-to-use prognostic instrument to predict PCRD after RP+PLND. This model may allow clinicians to correctly counsel patients regarding the intensity of follow-up and to tailor adjuvant treatments.

Published results from the Stockholm-3 study represent a snapshot of possible outcomes for prostate cancer detection using the S3M test. In this brief report, we show how the full range of cancer detection rates and percent saved biopsies depend on the chosen S3M cut-off for recommending prostate biopsy. Using data from the Stockholm-3 validation cohort (n=47 688), we calculated the cancer detection rates and percent saved biopsies for various S3M test cut-offs in men with PSA ≥1ng/ml. Cancer detection rates decline and fewer prostate biopsies have to be performed with increasing test cut-offs. Primarily, S3M test values between 7% and 14% can be considered for biopsy decision cut-offs (10% risk of Gleason score ≥ 7 corresponds to PSA=3 ng/ml); the exact cutoff can be chosen to fit different healthcare systems and, indeed, individual men. PATIENT SUMMARY: The Stockholm-3 Model test improves the detection of high-grade prostate cancer compared with prostate-specific antigen.

In this first stage, four doses of intracavernous autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) were tested in 12 patients. Here, we report the results of stage II, in which six additional patients received the optimal dose identified in stage I (109 BM-MNCs), and the long-term results in the 12 patients included in stage I. The objectives were to assess the safety and efficacy of this new treatment. In stage II, no patients had side effects, and the erectile function improvements were similar to those seen in stage I: after 6 months, significant improvements versus baseline were noted in International Index of Erectile Function-15 intercourse satisfaction (7.8±3.1 vs 2.2±3.4, p=0.033) and erectile function (18±8.3 vs 3.7±4.1, p=0.035) domains. In stage I patients, after a mean follow-up of 62.1±11.7 mo, there were no prostate cancer recurrences, and erectile function scores were somewhat lower compared with the 1-yr time point. These findings suggest that intracavernous BM-MNC injections are safe and improve erectile function. The decline in erectile function over time suggests a need for assessing repeated injections.  Patient summary:   We report a phase 1/2 pilot clinical trial of cell therapy consisting in intracavernous injection of bone marrow mononuclear cells to treat postradical prostatectomy erectile dysfunction.

Objective:   To establish and validate a contemporary nomogram that predicts the absolute risk of BR every year after RP in men with undetectable PSA while accounting for competing risks of death.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 3746 patients from Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen, Denmark) and Stanford Urology (Stanford, CA, USA) who underwent RP between 1995 and 2013 were included.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Time to BR was defined as the first PSA result ≥0.2 ng/ml. BR risk was computed using multiple cause-specific Cox regression including preoperative PSA, pT category, RP Gleason score (GS), and surgical margin (R) status. Death without BR was considered a competing event. The nomogram presents the future risk of BR for a man who is alive and without BR at the time of follow-up. Validation assessed the discrimination and accuracy using time-dependent area under the curve and Brier scores.  Results and limitations:   The nomogram predicts risk of BR up to 12 yr after RP at an individual level. As example, the risk of BR for a man with pT3a, R-, GS 3 + 4, and preoperative PSA ≤10 ng/ml followed for 5 yr with undetectable PSA is 18% for the next 5 yr. External validation demonstrated both high accuracy and discrimination. The CPC Risk Calculator is available as a free Android and iOS App. Declining discrimination and accuracy after 7 yr of follow-up is the main limitation.  Conclusions:   This nomogram can be used as a tool to inform men with undetectable PSA during follow-up after RP about their future risk of BR, and may aid in decisions on the necessity for further follow-up. The nomogram is the first to be available as a free app.  Patient summary:   We developed an easily interpretable nomogram to evaluate the risk of prostate-specific antigen elevation (cancer recurrence) following complete removal of the prostate (radical prostatectomy).

Objective:   To report 5-yr outcomes for our previously published prospective randomised study comparing RARP and LRP.  Design, setting, and participants:   From January 2010 to January 2011, 120 patients with organ-confined prostate cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned to RARP or LRP.  Intervention:   A single surgeon performed all interventions using the same transperitoneal anterograde technique.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Continence, potency, and serum prostate-specific antigen were assessed postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo, and then every 6 mo until 60 mo. At the end of the follow-up period, patients were administered questions 1 and 46 of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire to assess their satisfaction with the intervention and general health status. A generalised estimating equations model was used to compare time series data for functional results, and Kaplan-Meier and Cox models were used to analyse oncologic outcomes.  Results and limitations:   The probability of achieving continence (odds ratio [OR] 2.47, p<0.021) and potency (OR 2.35, p<0.028) over time was more than doubled for the RARP compared to the LRP group. There was no difference between the two approaches in terms of patient survival. Pathologic Gleason score, positive surgical margins, and pT stage were associated with significantly higher biochemical recurrence in Cox multivariate models. Patient satisfaction with the intervention and their general health status was significantly higher in the RARP group.

While approximately 30% of these patients do not experience recurrence, others experience disease recurrence despite ADT, and currently no biomarkers can accurately identify them. We analyzed tumors from 51 patients with node-positive prostate cancer using immunohistochemistry to investigate whether expression of the immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1 by tumor cells or the density of CD8+ or CD20+ cells are associated with clinical progression. Patients with at least 1% PD-L1+ tumor cells had shorter metastasis-free survival than those with PD-L1- tumors (p=0.008, log-rank test). Univariate Cox regression showed that patients with PD-L1+ tumors had almost four times the risk of experiencing distant metastases than those with PD-L1- tumors (hazard ratio 3.90). In addition, we found that PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with CD8+ T-cell density, but not with CD20+ B-cell density. While these results need to be confirmed in larger studies, they show that PD-L1 and CD8 may be used as biomarkers for node-positive patients at high risk of progression. The study also provides a rationale for selecting patients with node-positive PCa who might benefit the most from adjuvant immunotherapies. PATIENT SUMMARY: None of the available biomarkers can identify node-positive prostate cancer that will recur after surgery.

Objective:   To examine the incidence and predictors of upgrading and upstaging among patients with Gleason 3+4 FIR disease.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study involved 10 089 patients in the National Cancer Database diagnosed from 2010 to 2012 with Gleason 3+4 disease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10ng/ml, and cT1c-2a prostate cancer with <50% positive biopsy cores (PBCs) who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression was used to examine predictors of upgrading (pathologic Gleason ≥4+3 or tertiary Gleason 5 in a Gleason 7 tumor) or upstaging (pT3-4/N1).  Results and limitations:   Some 30.3% of Gleason 3+4 FIR patients were upgraded or upstaged. On multivariable analysis, predictors included higher PSA, percentage PBC, age, and cT2a versus cT1c (all p<0.001), but not black race (p=0.895). When stratified into ordinal variables, PSA 8.1-9.9 versus ≤4.0ng/ml (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.93, 38.3% vs 24.4%), PBC 37.5-49.9% versus <12.5% (AOR 1.79, 37.8% vs 25.1%); highest age quartile (≥67 yr) versus lowest (≤55 yr; AOR 1.46, 35.7% vs 24.7%); and cT2a versus cT1c (AOR 1.33, 34.3% vs 29.8%) were associated with a higher risk of upgrading or upstaging (all p<0.001). Men with PBC <12.5% and PSA ≤4.0ng/ml had a 21.7% risk of more advanced disease. This increased to 44.3% for PBC 37.5-49.9% and PSA 8.1-9.9ng/ml. A limitation of the study is its retrospective nature.  Conclusions:   Approximately one in three patients with Gleason 3+4 FIR harbored disease of higher grade or stage. Younger patients with low percentage PBC and PSA and cT1c disease have a lower risk and may be candidates for active surveillance. However, widely available clinical information is insufficient for predicting the risk of more advanced disease, and the development and incorporation of additional tools, including magnetic resonance imaging and genomic tests, are necessary.  Patient summary:   Nearly one-third of patients with Gleason 3+4 favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer harbor disease of higher grade or higher stage than their biopsy and clinical examination suggest.

Objective:   Validation of the prognostic biomarker phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7) in predicting longitudinal biological outcomes in a historical surgery cohort to improve postsurgical risk stratification.  Design, patients, and methods:   RNA was extracted from biopsy punches of resected tumors from 550 patients. PDE4D7 was quantified using one-step quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. PDE4D7 scores were calculated by normalization of PDE4D7 to reference genes. Multivariate analyses were adjusted for clinical prognostic variables. Outcomes tested were: prostate-specific antigen relapse, start of salvage treatment, progression to metastases, overall mortality, and prostate cancer-specific mortality. The PDE4D7 score was combined with the clinical risk model Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical Score (CAPRA-S) using multivariate regression modeling; the combined score was tested in post-treatment progression free survival prediction.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Correlations with outcomes were analyzed using multivariate Cox regression and logistic regression statistics.  Results and limitations:   The PDE4D7 score was significantly associated with time-to-prostate specific antigen failure after prostatectomy (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.41-0.67 for each unit increase, p<0.0001). After adjustment for postsurgical prognostic variables the HR was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.43-0.73, p<0.0001). The PDE4D7 score remained significant after adjusting the multi-variate analysis for the CAPRA-S model categories (HR=0.54, 95% CI=0.42-0.69, p<0.0001). Combination of the PDE4D7 score with the CAPRA-S demonstrated a significant incremental value of 4-6% in 2-yr (p=0.004) or 5-yr (p=0.003) prediction of progression free survival after surgery. The combined model of PDE4D7 and CAPRA-S improves patient selection with very high risk of fast disease relapse after primary intervention.  Conclusions:   The PDE4D7 score has the potential to provide independent risk information and to restratify patients with clinical intermediate- to high-risk characteristics to a very low-risk profile.  Patient summary:   In this report, we studied the potential of a novel biomarker to predict outcomes of a cohort of prostate cancer patients who underwent surgery more than 10 yr ago.

We have previously shown that the Stockholm-3 model (S3M) can reduce biopsies compared with using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥3ng/ml as an indication for biopsy. Urologists in today's current prostate cancer testing (CPT) have access to numerous variables in addition to PSA (eg, age, ethnicity, family history, free PSA, PSA velocity, digital rectal examination, and prostate volume) to support biopsy decisions. We estimated the number of prostate cancers diagnosed and prostate biopsies performed if S3M replaced CPT in Stockholm, Sweden, by comparing biopsy results in 56 282 men who underwent PSA testing according to CPT in Stockholm in 2011 with the 47 688 men enrolled in the STHLM3 validation cohort 2012-2015. With the same sensitivity as CPT to diagnose Gleason score ≥7 prostate cancer, S3M was estimated to reduce the number of men biopsied by 53% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41-65%), avoid 76% (95% CI: 67-81%) of negative biopsies, and reduce Gleason score 6 cancers by 23% (95% CI: 6-40%). S3M has the potential to improve prostate cancer diagnostics by better selecting men with high risk of GS ≥7 prostate cancer. PATIENT SUMMARY: We modeled the effect the Stockholm-3 model would have on prostate cancer diagnostics if it replaced current clinical practice. We found that Stockholm-3 model may substantially reduce the number of biopsies, while maintaining the same sensitivity to diagnose clinically significant prostate cancer.""","""['Martin Eklund', 'Tobias Nordström', 'Markus Aly', 'Jan Adolfsson', 'Peter Wiklund', 'Yvonne Brandberg', 'James Thompson', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Johan Lindberg', 'Joseph C Presti', 'Mark StLezin', 'Mark Clements', 'Lars Egevad', 'Henrik Grönberg']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['The Stockholm-3 Model for Prostate Cancer Detection: Algorithm Update, Biomarker Contribution, and Reflex Test Potential.', 'Balancing Overdiagnosis and Early Detection of Prostate Cancer using the Stockholm-3 Model.', 'Prostate cancer screening in men aged 50 to 69 years (STHLM3): A prospective population-based diagnostic study.

Objective:   To evaluate long-term oncologic outcomes following RARP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective cohort study of 885 patients who underwent RARP as monotherapy for PCa between 2002 and 2006 in a single European centre and followed up until 2016.  Intervention:   RARP as monotherapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival (BCRFS), salvage therapy (ST)-free survival (STFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and event-time distributions were compared using the log-rank test. Variables predictive of BCR and ST were identified using Cox proportional hazards models.  Results and limitations:   We identified 167 BCRs, 110 STs, 16 PCa-related deaths, and 51 deaths from other/unknown causes. BCRFS, STFS, CSS, and OS rates were 81.8%, 87.5%, 98.5%, and 93.0%, respectively, at median follow-up of 10.5 yr. On multivariable analysis, the strongest independent predictors of both BCR and ST were preoperative Gleason score, pathological T stage, positive surgical margins (PSMs), and preoperative prostate-specific antigen. PSM >3mm/multifocal but not ≤3mm independently affected the risk of both BCR and ST. Study limitations include a lack of centralised histopathologic reporting, lymph node and post-operative tumour volume data in a historical cohort, and patient-reported outcomes.  Conclusions:   RARP appears to confer effective long-term oncologic efficacy. The risk of BCR or ST is unaffected by ≤3mm PSM, but further follow-up is required to determine any impact on CSS.  Patient summary:   Robot-assisted surgery for prostate cancer is effective 10 yr after treatment. Very small (<3mm) amounts of cancer at the cut edge of the prostate do not appear to impact on recurrence risk and the need for additional treatment, but it is not yet known whether this affects the risk of death from prostate cancer.""","""['Prabhakar Rajan', 'Anna Hagman', 'Prasanna Sooriakumaran', 'Tommy Nyberg', 'Anna Wallerstedt', 'Christofer Adding', 'Olof Akre', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Abolfazl Hosseini', 'Mats Olsson', 'Lars Egevad', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Gunnar Steineck', 'N Peter Wiklund']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Oncologic outcomes at 10 years following robotic radical prostatectomy.', 'Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes in patients with clinically high-risk prostate cancer treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results from a multi-institutional study of 1100 patients.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting oncologic outcome after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Metabolic syndrome and its components predict the biochemical recurrence and adverse pathological features of patients following radical prostatectomy: a propensity score matching study.', 'Selection of patients for nerve sparing surgery in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'A multi-surgeon learning curve analysis of overall and site-specific positive surgical margins after RARP and implications for training.', 'Degree of Preservation of Neurovascular Bundles in Radical Prostatectomy and Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prediction of a positive surgical margin and biochemical recurrence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

To date, six men (of a planned accrual of 24) with clinically localized, biopsy-proven PCa have undergone preoperative [18F]-DCFPyL positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging acquired using a hybrid PET/MRI system. Lesions identified by [18F]-DCFPyL uptake on PET/MRI were characterized in terms of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and volume using a boundary threshold of 40% SUVmax. Following surgery, all prostatectomy specimens were processed using a whole-mount technique for accurate deformable co-registration and correlation with PCa foci defined on digitized pathology images. Well-defined intraprostatic dominant lesions were identified by [18F]-DCFPyL PET/MRI (mean SUVmax 11.4±8.25; mean volume 2.2±2.4cm3) in all six men. Co-registered digitized whole-mount pathology for the first case revealed that intense [18F]-DCFPyL uptake (SUVmax 27±1.1cm3) and multiparametric MRI changes (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score of 4) were highly correlated with a 0.5-cm3 dominant (largest) lesion with Gleason pattern 4 PCa in the right mid peripheral zone. A smaller focus (0.01cm3) of lower-grade PCa (Gleason pattern 3) had much lower uptake (SUV 2.7). These early prospective data show that dominant intraprostatic lesions could be identified in all six men using [18F]-DCFPyL as an imaging probe. Trial accrual will continue to quantify in terms of spatial concordance the ability of [18F]-DCFPyL to identify the location and characterize the grade of intraprostatic cancer foci in clinically localized PCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: Positron emission tomography using a novel probe called [18F]-DCFPyL directed against the prostate-specific membrane antigen protein was able to identify locations of prostate cancer in the prostate glands of men undergoing imaging before surgery. In the future, such imaging may allow better targeting of treatment to the portion of the prostate containing the most aggressive components of cancer rather than treating the whole prostate in a uniform fashion.""","""['Glenn Bauman', 'Peter Martin', 'Jonathan D Thiessen', 'Reggie Taylor', 'Madeleine Moussa', 'Mena Gaed', 'Irina Rachinsky', 'Zahra Kassam', 'Joseph Chin', 'Stephen Pautler', 'Ting Yim Lee', 'John F Valliant', 'Aaron Ward']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Comparison between 18 F-DCFPyL PET and MRI for the detection of transition zone prostate cancer.', '18F-DCFBC Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted PET/CT Imaging in Localized Prostate Cancer: Correlation With Multiparametric MRI and Histopathology.', 'Increased Prostate Cancer Glucose Metabolism Detected by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Localised Gleason 8-10 Prostate Cancers Identifies Very High-risk Patients for Early Recurrence and Resistance to Castration.', 'Integration of PSMA-targeted PET imaging into the armamentarium for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Current and Emerging Clinical Applications of PSMA PET Diagnostic Imaging for Prostate Cancer.', 'The use of Lutetium-177 PSMA radioligand therapy with high dose rate brachytherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after previous definitive radiation therapy: a randomized, single-institution, phase I/II study (ROADSTER).', 'Functional Imaging of Liver Cancer (FLIC): Study protocol of a phase 2 trial of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Imaging Biomarkers in Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy: A Review and Clinical Trial Protocol.', 'Combination of MRI prostate and 18F-DCFPyl PSMA PET/CT detects all clinically significant prostate cancers in treatment-naive patients: An international multicentre retrospective study.', 'Prospective analysis of clinically significant prostate cancer detection with 18FDCFPyL PET/MRI compared to multiparametric MRI: a comparison with the histopathology in the radical prostatectomy specimen, the ProStaPET study.']"""

However, as trial populations are selected, results may not be representative for the real-world population. The aim of this study was to assess the differences between patients treated in a clinical trial versus standard care during the course of CRPC in a real-world CRPC population.  Design, setting, and participants:   Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Registry is a population-based, observational, retrospective registry. CRPC patients from 20 hospitals in the Netherlands have been included from 2010 to 2013.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Baseline characteristics, systemic treatment, and overall survival were the main outcomes. Descriptive statistics, multivariate Cox regression, and multiple imputations with the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method were used.  Results and limitations:   In total, 1524 patients were enrolled of which 203 patients had participated in trials at any time. The median follow-up period was 23 mo. Patients in the trial group were significantly younger and had less comorbidities. Docetaxel treatment was more frequently used in trial patients (85% vs 40%). Despite an observed unadjusted median overall survival difference of 35 mo versus 24 mo between the trial and standard care group, this difference was not retained after adjustment for baseline characteristics and treatment effect.  Conclusions:   At CRPC diagnosis, the baseline characteristics of the patients who had been enrolled in trials notably differed from patients who received standard treatment options only. The survival difference between the trial and standard care group could be explained by baseline differences and treatment effects. These results indicate that trial results cannot easily be translated to real-world practice.  Patient summary:   We observed that patients treated in clinical trials differed from patients who were not. We concluded that this may lead to differential treatment and survival.

Consensus criteria based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and clinical and radiologic biomarkers are inconsistently utilized. Circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts can inform prognosis and response, but are not routinely used.  Objective:   To evaluate the use of biomarkers and trends in clinical decision-making in current mCRPC treatment.  Design, setting, and participants:   A 23-part online questionnaire was completed by physicians treating mCRPC.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   Results are presented as the proportion (%) of physicians responding to each of the options. We used χ2 and Fisher's tests to compare differences.  Results and limitations:   A total of 118 physicians (22.1%) responded. Of these, 69.4% treated ≥50 mCRPC patients/year. More physicians administered four or fewer courses of cabazitaxel (27.9%) than for docetaxel (10.4%), with no significant difference in the number of courses between bone-only disease and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST)-evaluable disease. Some 74.5% of respondents considered current biomarkers useful for monitoring disease, but only 39.6% used the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) criteria in clinical practice. PSA was considered an important biomarker by 55.7%, but only 41.4% discarded changes in PSA before 12 wk, and only 39.4% were able to identify bone-scan progression according to PCWG2. The vast majority of physicians (90.5%) considered clinical progression to be important for switching treatment. The proportion considering biomarkers important was 71.6% for RECIST, 47.4% for bone scans, 23.2% for CTCs, and 21.1% for PSA. Although 53.1% acknowledged that baseline CTC counts are prognostic, only 33.7% would use CTC changes alone to switch treatment in patients with bone-only disease. The main challenges in using CTC counts were access to CTC technology (84.7%), cost (74.5%), and uncertainty over utility as a response indicator (58.2%).  Conclusions:   A significant proportion of physicians discontinue treatment for mCRPC before 12 wk, raising concerns about inadequate response assessment. Many physicians find current biomarkers useful, but most rely on symptoms to drive treatment switch decisions, suggesting there is a need for more precise biomarkers.  Patient summary:   In this report we analyse the results of a questionnaire evaluating tools for clinical decision-making completed by 118 prostate cancer specialists.

We prospectively enrolled ten hormone therapy-naïve men undergoing salvage pelvic lymph node dissection (sPLND) and analyzed their peripheral blood (PB) and positive pelvic lymph nodes (PPLNs) with PCa metastases for tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) using flow cytometry. MDSCs were stratified into CD14+ monocytic and CD14- granulocytic types. PD-L1/2 expression was also analyzed for MDSCs. Relative to PB, tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells accumulated in PPLNs (p<0.01) yet had decreased proliferation, with low Ki67 expression (p<0.05). Both CD14+ monocytic and CD14- granulocytic MDSCs were found in PPLNs, but there was an increase in the proportion of CD8+ T cells in PPLNs compared to PB (p<0.01). The granulocytic MDSCs exhibited a high degree of immunosuppressive activity (as evidenced by high pSTAT3 levels) and high levels of B7-H1 (PD-L1) and B7-DC (PD-L2) expression. Thus, granulocytic MDSCs probably suppress tumor-reactive CD8+ T-cells in PPLNs and exhibit high expression of immune checkpoint molecules in PCa nodal metastases. The data suggest a relative immunosuppressive state in PPLNs. This provides a biologic rationale for sPLND beyond just tumor debulking, and calls for further investigation of immune checkpoint blockade.  Patient summary:   Prostate cancer metastases to lymph nodes may involve immunosuppressive cells that evade antitumor T-cells and create a relatively immunosuppressed state. This provides a rationale for treatment of such lymph nodes and/or for potential immunotherapy.""","""['Vidit Sharma', 'Haidong Dong', 'Eugene Kwon', 'R Jeffrey Karnes']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['CD4+ T effector memory cell dysfunction is associated with the accumulation of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells in glioblastoma patients.', 'PD-L1 Expression and CD8+ T-cell Infiltrate are Associated with Clinical Progression in Patients with Node-positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Human splenic myeloid derived suppressor cells: Phenotypic and clustering analysis.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'The role of pelvic lymphadenectomy in the management of prostate and bladder cancer.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.', 'Immune-Activated B Cells Are Dominant in Prostate Cancer.', 'Low Blood Levels of LRG1 Before Radical Prostatectomy Identify Patients with High Risk of Progression to Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Pivotal antitumor role of the immune checkpoint molecule B7-H1 in pancreatic cancer.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

Objective:   To determine whether men with VMs at initial mCRPC diagnosis have worse overall survival (OS) and identify predictors of VMs.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed 494 men diagnosed with castration-resistant prostate cancer post-1999 and no known metastases from five Veterans Affairs hospitals of the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database who later developed metastases. Radiology scans within 30 d of initial metastasis diagnosis were reviewed to collect information on bone, visceral, and lymph node metastases. We analyzed the 236 men who had a computed tomography scan performed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Predictors of VMs and OS were evaluated using logistic regression and Cox models, respectively.  Results and limitations:   Of the 236 mCRPC patients, 38 (16%) had VMs. Regarding VMs, 19 patients (50%), 8 patients (21%), and 16 patients (42%) had metastases in the liver, lungs, and other locations, respectively. VMs were a predictor of OS on crude analysis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-2.72; p=0.001) and after risk adjustment (HR: 1.84; 95% CI, 1.24-2.72; p=0.002). Age, year, treatment center, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and time from CRPC to metastases were significant in predicting OS (all p<0.05). None of the variables tested were associated with having VMs (all p > 0.09). Prospective studies and larger cohorts are needed to validate our findings.  Conclusions:   Demographic, tumor, and PSA kinetic characteristics were not predictive of having VMs, but VMs predicted worse OS.  Patient summary:   Because patients with VMs have worse overall survival, further research is needed to develop better biomarkers and thus diagnose those with VMs at earlier stages in their disease course.""","""['Colette A Whitney', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Edwin M Posadas', 'Christopher L Amling', 'William J Aronson', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Martha K Terris', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Is computed tomography a necessary part of a metastatic evaluation for castration-resistant prostate cancer?

Patients were included if they met ERSPC RC requirements of age (50-80 yr), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (0.4-50 ng/ml), and prostate volume (10-150ml). The probability of a positive biopsy for prostate cancer (PCa) and significant PCa (Gleason score ≥7 and/or higher than T2b) were calculated and compared with PBx pathology results.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Evaluation was performed by calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness using calibration plots, area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs), and decision curve analyses (DCAs), respectively.  Results and limitations:   A total of 2270 PBx sessions were eligible for final analysis. Discriminative ability of RC3 (AUC) was 0.78 and 0.90 for any PCa and significant PCa, respectively. For RC4 the calculated AUCs were 0.62 (any PCa) and 0.76 (significant PCa). The calibration plots of RC3 showed good results for both any PCa risk and significant PCa risk. In the repeat PBx group, RC4 tended to underestimate outcomes for PCa and showed moderate calibration for significant PCa. DCA showed an overall net benefit compared with PSA and digital rectal examination (DRE) alone. Limitations of this study are its retrospective single-institution design, retrospectively assessed DRE outcomes, no time restrictions between the first and repeat biopsy sessions, and no anterior sampling in the repeat PBx protocol.  Conclusions:   The ERSPC RCs performed well in a contemporary clinical setting. Most pronounced in the biopsy-naive group, both RCs should be favoured over a PSA plus DRE-based stratification in the decision whether or not to perform PBx.

Objective:   We evaluated the nationwide utilization rate of AS in the contemporary era.  Design, setting, and participants:   We relied on the 2010-2011 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database using all 18 SEER-based registries. We identified 9049 patients that fulfilled the University of California, San Francisco AS criteria (prostate-specific antigen level <10ng/ml, clinical T stage ≤2a, Gleason score ≤6 [no pattern 4 or 5], and percentage of positive biopsy cores <33%).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression analysis tested the relationship between receiving local treatment and all available predictors.  Results and limitations:   Only 32% of AS candidates did not receive any active local treatment. This proportion varied widely among the SEER-based registries, ranging from 13% to 49% (p<0.001). In multivariable analyses, clinical stage T2a (odds ratio [OR]: 1.23; p=0.04) and percentage of positive cores (OR: 1.10 for each 2% increase; p<0.001) were associated with a higher probability of receiving local treatment. Conversely, older age (OR: 0.89 for each 2-yr increase; p<0.001), not being married (OR: 0.64; p<0.001), and uninsured status (OR: 0.55; p=0.008) were associated with a lower probability of receiving active local treatment. The study is limited by the fact that SEER does not distinguish among patients undergoing observation, AS, watchful waiting, or initial hormonal therapy.  Conclusions:   In the United States, a considerable proportion of patients suitable for AS receive local treatment for PCa. Proportions differ significantly among SEER registries.

Objective:   To investigate (1) whether computer-extracted image features within tumor-adjacent benign regions on digital pathology images could predict recurrence in PCa patients after surgery and (2) whether a tumor plus adjacent benign signature (TABS) could better predict recurrence compared with Gleason score or features from benign or cancerous regions alone.  Design, setting, and participants:   We studied 140 tissue microarray cores (0.6mm each) from 70 PCa patients following surgery between 2000 and 2004 with up to 14 yr of follow-up. Overall, 22 patients experienced recurrence (biochemical [prostate-specific antigen], local, or distant recurrence and cancer death) and 48 did not.  Intervention:   RP was performed in all patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The top 10 features identified as most predictive of recurrence within both the benign and cancerous regions were combined into a 10-feature signature (TABS). Computer-extracted nuclear shape and architectural features from cancerous regions, adjacent benign fields, and TABS were evaluated via random forest classification accuracy and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.  Results and limitations:   Tumor-adjacent benign field features were predictive of recurrence (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.72). Tumor-field nuclear shape descriptors and benign-field local nuclear arrangement were the predominant features found for TABS (AUC: 0.77). Combining TABS with Gleason sum further improved identification of recurrence (AUC: 0.81). All experiments were performed using threefold cross-validation without independent test set validation.  Conclusions:   Computer-extracted nuclear features within cancerous and benign regions predict recurrence following RP. Furthermore, TABS was shown to provide added value to common predictors including Gleason sum and Kattan and Stephenson nomograms.

It is currently unclear how prostate cancer screening, tumor and patient characteristics, or treatment selection may affect this association.  Objective:   To evaluate the risk of prostate cancer death among statin users. To determine how disease and treatment characteristics affect the association.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a population-based cohort study consisting of a general male population of Finland participating in the Finnish Randomized Study for Prostate Cancer Screening. The cohort of consisted of 6537 prostate cancer cases diagnosed in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer population during 1996-2012. The cohort was linked to the National Prescription Database for information on the use of statins and other drugs.  Intervention:   Statin use before and after prostate cancer diagnosis compared with nonuse.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of prostate cancer death by amount, duration, and intensity of statin use. Cox proportional hazards regression with postdiagnostic statin use as a time-dependent variable.  Results:   During the median follow-up of 7.5 yr postdiagnosis 617 men died of prostate cancer. Statin use after diagnosis was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer death (HR 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.65-0.98). A decreasing risk trend was observed by increasing intensity of usage (doses/year). The risk decrease was clearest in men managed with androgen deprivation therapy. Prediagnostic statin use was not associated with risk of prostate cancer death (HR 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.75-1.12).  Conclusions:   Decreased risk of prostate cancer death by statin use after diagnosis suggests that statins may delay or prevent prostate cancer progression. The risk decrease was significant only in men managed with androgen deprivation therapy, but statistical power was limited to estimate the association in men managed with surgery or radiotherapy.

Objective:   To assess the feasibility and potential prognostic role of three different substaging systems in specimens from both primary and second transurethral resection (TUR) of the bladder in T1 high-grade bladder cancer patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 250 consecutive, confirmed pure transitional T1 high-grade bladder tumors submitted to second TUR entered the retrospective study.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Feasibility of two already clinically tested microstaging systems (anatomy-based T1a/T1b/T1c and micrometric T1m/T1e with 0.5-mm thresholds of invasion) and that of a micrometric substage designed by the authors and based on a 1-mm threshold of invasion (Rete Oncologica Lombarda [ROL] system) was assessed by five independent uropathologists on both first and second TUR specimens. Univariable Cox proportional hazards models were attempted to identify significant independent predictors of recurrence and progression after TUR. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to compare different substaging methods analyzing recurrence and progression.  Results and limitations:   The ROL system proved to be feasible in nearly all cases at both first and second TUR. Median follow-up was 60 mo. The univariate Cox regression analysis documented the ROL substage (ROL2 vs ROL1) to be the only statistically significant predictor of progression (hazard ratio: 2.01; 95% CI, 1.03-3.79; p<0.03). For the first time to our knowledge, the substage was investigated and used to assess T1 tumors found at second TUR, registering a high rate of feasibility.  Conclusions:   T1 microstaging using different procedures is feasible on both primary- and second-TUR specimens. A high rate of feasibility may be expected for T1m/T1e and ROL systems. The clinical role of microstaging on second TUR remains to be defined.  Patient summary:   The Rete Oncologica Lombarda system showed feasible results in T1 high-grade bladder tumors.

At baseline, 6.6% (n = 120) of PLCO participants self-reported a history of diabetes. Cross-sectional associations between these markers and self-reported diabetes were assessed using weighted logistic regression adjusting for sex, smoking status, blood draw age and year, body mass index, and cohort sub-study. Including chemokines [C-C motif ligand (CCL) 19, CCL20, CCL21, C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL) 6, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and soluble cytokine and chemokine receptors [soluble (s) interleukin (IL) 6 receptor (R), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR) 1, sTNFR2, and sIL-R2], ten inflammation-related markers, were nominally associated with diabetes (P<0.05). In addition to these associations, higher levels of insulin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, and pancreatic polypeptide remained significantly associated with self-reported diabetes with a false discovery rate <5%, indicating that the assay was able to detect markers associated with diabetes. In summary, self-reported diabetes was nominally associated with circulating cytokines, chemokines, and soluble cytokine and chemokine receptors in the most expansive examination of diabetes and inflammation- and immune-related markers to date.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in human cancers, including ECC, and recent studies indicated that the lncRNA prostate cancer-associated transcript 1 (non-protein coding) (PCAT1) is involved in multiple cancers. However, the role of PCAT1 in ECC is unclear. Previously, we showed that PCAT1 is up-regulated in both ECC tissue samples and cell lines. Here, we showed that downregulation of PCAT1 following transfection with silencing RNA reduced ECC cell growth and increased cell apoptosis. Additionally, PCAT1 suppression inhibited ECC cell migration and invasion as determined by transwell assay. Furthermore, we determined that PCAT1 is a competing endogenous for microRNA (miR)-122, with bioinformatics analysis and luciferase-reporter assay results demonstrating that PCAT1 regulated WNT1 expression via miR-122. Moreover, PCAT1 downregulation increased levels of glycogen synthase kinase 3β and significantly decreased β-catenin levels in whole cell lysates and nuclear fractions, indicating that PCAT1 silencing inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin-signaling pathway. We also observed that exogenous expression of WNT1 reversed PCAT1-silencing-induced inhibition of ECC cell growth inhibition. These results indicated that PCAT1 silencing inhibited ECC progression by reducing Wnt/β-catenin signaling through miR-122 repression and WNT1 expression. Our findings revealed an important role of PCAT1 in ECC and suggested that PCAT1 might be a potential ECC-related therapeutic target.""","""['Fumin Zhang', 'Ming Wan', 'Yi Xu', 'Zhenglong Li', 'Kaiming Leng', 'Pengcheng Kang', 'Yunfu Cui', 'Xingming Jiang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Long non-coding RNA CCAT1 is a prognostic biomarker for the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma via miR-181a-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'LncRNA-PCAT1 maintains characteristics of dermal papilla cells and promotes hair follicle regeneration by regulating miR-329/Wnt10b axis.', 'The Long Non-Coding RNA CASC2 Suppresses Cell Viability, Migration, and Invasion in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells by Directly Downregulating miR-183.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade: A promising target for glioma therapy.', 'The roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway related lncRNAs in cancer.', 'Activation of IGFBP4 via unconventional mechanism of miRNA attenuates metastasis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.', 'An overview of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: from here to where?', 'Inhibition of ClC-5 suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Long Non-Coding RNAs as Molecular Biomarkers in Cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Dioscin ameliorates inflammatory bowel disease by up-regulating miR-125a-5p to regulate macrophage polarization.']"""

FIRSTANA ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01308567) assessed whether cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 (C20) or 25 mg/m2 (C25) is superior to docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (D75) in terms of OS in patients with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC. Patients and Methods Patients with mCRPC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive C20, C25, or D75 intravenously every 3 weeks plus daily prednisone. The primary end point was OS. Secondary end points included safety; progression-free survival (PFS); tumor, prostate-specific antigen, and pain response; pharmacokinetics; and health-related quality of life. Results Between May 2011 and April 2013, 1,168 patients were randomly assigned. Baseline characteristics were similar across cohorts. Median OS was 24.5 months with C20, 25.2 months with C25, and 24.3 months with D75. Hazard ratio for C20 versus D75 was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.20; P = .997), and hazard ratio for C25 versus D75 was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.16; P = .757). Median PFS was 4.4 months with C20, 5.1 months with C25, and 5.3 months with D75, with no significant differences between treatment arms. Radiographic tumor responses were numerically higher for C25 (41.6%) versus D75 (30.9%; nominal P = .037, without multiplicity test adjustment).

Such microstructural changes could result in variations in mechanical properties, which can be used in diagnosing or monitoring a wide range of diseases, most notably cancer. This paves the avenue for non-invasive diagnosis by instrumented palpation although challenges remain in quantitatively assessing the amount of diseased tissue by means of mechanical characterization. This paper presents a framework for tissue diagnosis using a quantitative and efficient estimation of the fractions of cancerous and non-cancerous tissue without a priori knowledge of tissue microstructure. First, the sample is tested in a creep or stress relaxation experiment, and the behavior is characterized using a single term Prony series. A rule of mixtures, which relates tumor fraction to the apparent mechanical properties, is then obtained by minimizing the difference between strain energy of a heterogeneous system and an equivalent homogeneous one. Finally, the percentage of each tissue constituent is predicted by comparing the observed relaxation time with that calculated from the rule of mixtures. The proposed methodology is assessed using models reconstructed from histological samples and magnetic resonance imaging of prostate. Results show that estimation of cancerous tissue fraction can be obtained with a maximum error of 12% when samples of different sizes, geometries, and tumor fractions are presented. The proposed framework has the potential to be applied to a wide range of diseases such as rectal polyps, cirrhosis, or breast and prostate cancer whose current primary diagnosis remains qualitative.""","""['Javier Palacio-Torralba', 'Daniel W Good', 'Grant D Stewart', 'S Alan McNeill', 'Robert L Reuben', 'Yuhang Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Numer Method Biomed Eng""","""['A novel palpation-based method for tumor nodule quantification in soft tissue-computational framework and experimental validation.', 'Identification of tumor nodule in soft tissue: An inverse finite-element framework based on mechanical characterization.', 'Quantitative diagnostics of soft tissue through viscoelastic characterization using time-based instrumented palpation.', 'Tissue elasticity properties as biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Elasticity as a biomarker for prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'A novel palpation-based method for tumor nodule quantification in soft tissue-computational framework and experimental validation.', 'Evaluation of a Piezo-Actuated Sensor for Monitoring Elastic Variations of Its Support with Impedance-Based Measurements.']"""

Methods:   The UMSCs from human umbilical cord tissue were isolate by explant technique. After being co-cultured the UMSCs with LNCaP and PC-3 cells for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, LNCaP and PC-3 cells' proliferation were tested and the 72 h proliferation inhibitory rate (IR) was calculated. Transwell invasion assay was used to test the migration and invasion abilities of prostate cancer cells after being co-cultured with UMSCs for 48 h. The invasion IR were calculated. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 in the 72 h co-culture supernatants were tested by MILLIPLEX®MAPmethod.  Results:   The proliferation of prostate cancer cells was inhibited after being co-cultured with UMSCs. The proliferation rate of LNCaP was lower than control group at 72 h (P<0.05), and the proliferation IR was 37.21%. The proliferation rate of PC-3 was lower than control group at 48 h and 72 h (P<0.05), and the proliferation IR was 31.27% at 72 h.

Patients and methods:   One-hundred-twelve chemotherapy pretreated or chemotherapy-naive patients were scheduled for systemic treatment with AA. PNI levels were measured before and after one month of AA treatment. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictive factors of initial response to AA treatment. Univariable and Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to determine prognostic factors that were associated with PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), radiographic PFS (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). The Harrell concordance index with variables only or combined PNI data were used to evaluate the prognostic accuracy.  Results:   Eighty-one (72.3%) of 112 patients showed initial response to AA treatment, in which 15 experienced PSA flare during AA treatment. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, high baseline PNI level, PSA level decrease during the first month of AA treatment and PNI level elevation during the first month of AA treatment were significantly correlated with initial response to AA treatment. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, low PNI level remained significant predictors of OS, rPFS and PSA-PFS. The estimated c-index of the multivariate model for OS increased from 0.82 without PNI to 0.83 when PNI added.

However, the role of PNI in high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) has not been explored. The aims of the study were to investigate the impact of PNI on biochemical recurrence (BCR) and optimal timing of adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   A total of 265 prostatectomies, median follow-up 45 months, were assessed for the presence and intensity of PNI (unifocal and multifocal) in RP specimens. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate BCR probabilities. Cox proportional hazard models were used to address predictors of BCR. Harrell's C-index was conducted to further validate prognostic value of multi-PNI.  Results:   A total of 123 patients (46.4%) were PNI positive, among which, 91 (74%) and 32 (26%) had unifocal PNI (uni-PNI) and multifocal PNI (multi-PNI), respectively. The presence of multi-PNI was strongly associated with increasing incidence of BCR (HR = 3.87, 95%CI: 1.66-9.01, P = 0.002). Patients with uni-PNI had a similar BCR rate to those without PNI after adjuvant ADT. For men with multi-PNI, immediate ADT was superior to delayed ADT in decreasing biochemical failure.

The biological effects of the overexpression and knockdown of Numb in human prostate cancer cell lines were investigated in vitro and in vivo In addition, we developed a reliable approach to distinguish between prostate cancer cell populations with a high or low endogenous expression of Numb protein using a Numb promoter-based lentiviral reporter system. The difference between Numb-/low and Numbhigh prostate cancer cells in the response to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) was then tested. The likely downstream factors of Numb were analyzed using luciferase reporter assays, immunoblotting, and quantitative real-time PCR.Results: We show here that Numb was downregulated and negatively correlated with prostate cancer advancement. Functionally, Numb played an inhibitory role in xenograft prostate tumor growth and castration-resistant prostate cancer development by suppressing Notch and Hedgehog signaling. Using a Numb promoter-based lentiviral reporter system, we were able to distinguish Numb-/low prostate cancer cells from Numbhigh cells. Numb-/low prostate cancer cells were smaller and quiescent, preferentially expressed Notch and Hedgehog downstream and stem-cell-associated genes, and associated with a greater resistance to ADT.

The use of targeted panel next-generation sequencing (NGS) is inexpensive, high throughput, and easily feasible, allowing single-nucleotide variant calls, but CNA estimation from this remains challenging.Experimental Design: We evaluated CNVkit for CNA identification from amplicon-based targeted NGS in a cohort of 110 fresh castration-resistant prostate cancer biopsies and used capture-based whole-exome sequencing (WES), array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), and FISH to explore the viability of this approach.Results: We showed that this method produced highly reproducible CNA results (r = 0.92), with the use of pooled germline DNA as a coverage reference supporting precise CNA estimation. CNA estimates from targeted NGS were comparable with WES (r = 0.86) and aCGH (r = 0.7); for key selected genes (BRCA2, MYC, PIK3CA, PTEN, and RB1), CNA estimation correlated well with WES (r = 0.91) and aCGH (r = 0.84) results.

Study outcomes were the development of testosterone elevations greater than 0.7, greater than 1.1 and greater than 1.7 nmol/l, and progression to a castrate resistant state. Survival curves were constructed to determine the rate of testosterone elevations. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was done to assess whether elevations predicted progression to castrate resistance.  Results:   Median patient age was 74 years and median followup was 20.3 months.

Methods and materials:   We retrospectively examined 475 patients who received radiation for bone metastases at our institution from 2009 through 2014 and evaluated survival outcomes based on parameters of their first treatment course and patient demographics. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze factors associated with overall survival (OS). A recursive partition analysis (RPA) was used to generate a decision tree of patient characteristics resulting in significant differences in survival. A Cox model was used to verify the RPA and evaluate the significance of biologically equivalent dose (BED) along with other factors.  Results:   In our cohort, median age was 62 years and median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 70. Survival time by primary tumor type: breast (median, 35.9 months), prostate (12.8 months), other (median, 11.0 months), lung (median, 5.3 months), and gastrointestinal (median, 4.0 months) (P < .0001). Primary tumor type and KPS significantly affected survival, whereas age was also significant for survival in certain primary tumor types.

Proliferation may be restored in secondary metastases by mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). We tested whether E-cadherin maintains epithelial proliferation in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, facilitating metastatic colonization in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice.  Methods:   EMT/MET markers were assessed in xenograft tumors by immunohistochemistry. Stable E-cadherin manipulation was effected by transfection and verified by Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Effects of E-cadherin manipulation on proliferation and chemomigration were assessed in vitro by performing sulforhodamine B assays and Transwell assays, respectively. Invasion was assessed by Matrigel outgrowth; growth in vivo was assessed in SCID mice; and EMT status was assessed by qPCR. Hypoxic response of E-cadherin knockdown cell lines was assessed by qPCR after hypoxic culture. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), one- and two-way ANOVA with posttests, and paired Student's t tests were performed to determine significance (p < 0.05).  Results:   EMT occurred at the necrotic interface of MDA-MB-468 xenografts in regions of hypoxia. Extratumoral deposits (vascular and lymphatic inclusions, local and axillary nodes, and lung metastases) strongly expressed E-cadherin. MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing E-cadherin were more proliferative and less migratory in vitro, whereas E-cadherin knockdown (short hairpin CDH1 [shCDH1]) cells were more migratory and invasive, less proliferative, and took longer to form tumors. shCDH1-MDA-MB-468 xenografts did not contain the hypoxia-induced necrotic areas observed in wild-type (WT) and shSCR-MDA-MB-468 tumors, but they did not exhibit an impaired hypoxic response in vitro. Although vimentin expression was not stimulated by E-cadherin knockdown in 2D or 3D cultures, xenografts of these cells were globally vimentin-positive rather than exhibiting regional EMT, and they expressed higher SNA1 than their in vitro counterparts. E-cadherin suppression caused a trend toward reduced lung metastasis, whereas E-cadherin overexpression resulted in the reverse trend, consistent with the increased proliferation rate and predominantly epithelial phenotype of MDA-MB-468 cells outside the primary xenograft. This was also originally observed in WT xenografts. Furthermore, we found that patients with breast cancer that expressed E-cadherin were more likely to have metastases.  Conclusions:   E-cadherin expression promotes growth of primary breast tumors and conceivably the formation of metastases, supporting a role for MET in metastasis.

Aims:   The intention of this study was to verify if the intensive diagnostic procedures of haematuria patients is justified by detection of a significant proportion of genito-urinary tract cancers.  Materials and methods:   In a retrospective design 1049 consecutive patients, who presented themselves with macro- or microhaematuria in the outpatient clinic PURR in the time from 2011 to 2012, were included in the study and the diagnostic procedures including ultrasound, intravenous urography, computed tomography of the abdomen and urethrocystoscopy as well as therapeutic consequences with its results were analysed.  Results:   The study group comprised 570 women (54.3%) and 479 men (45.7%) with a median age of 58 years and macrohaematuria occurred in 89 patients.

Little is known about its prognostic value, particularly by tumour site. An optimised version has been recently developed, but no prognostic information is available. We compared the prognostic value of both instruments overall and by tumour site.  Methods:   Data were from a prospective cohort of cancer patients ≥70 years old referred to 1 of 6 French geriatric oncology clinics between 2007 and 2014 (n = 1333). Endpoints were overall 1- and 3-year survival. Cox proportional-hazards models were built to assess the predictive value of abnormal G8 and modified-G8 scores, based on published cut-offs or by classes of increasing risk. Sensitivity analyses involved adjusting for age, gender, treatment, metastasis, and tumour site (digestive, breast, urinary tract, prostate, other solid cancers, and haematological malignancies) and stratifying by tumour site and metastatic status.  Results:   Abnormal scores were independently associated with overall 1-year survival: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 4.3[G8]/4.9[modified-G8] and 3-year survival: aHR = 2.9/2.6; all p <0.0001. Associations persisted after stratifying by metastatic status and in most cancer sites (exceptions: colorectal (G8) and upper digestive cancer (both tools) [1-year analysis]; digestive cancers (both tools) [3-year analysis]). For both tools, classes of increasing risk showed a graded relationship with mortality (p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Our results identified both abnormal G8 and modified-G8 scores as strong and consistent predictors of overall survival, regardless of metastatic status or tumour site.

TH induced a strong accumulation of LNCaP cells in mitosis, severe mitotic spindle defects, and asymmetric cell divisions, ultimately leading to mitotic catastrophe accompanied by cell death through apoptosis. However, unlike microtubule-binding drugs (vinblastine and paclitaxel), TH did not directly inhibit tubulin polymerization when tested in a cell-free system, whereas it reduced cellular microtubule polymer mass in LNCaP cells. This suggests that TH indirectly targets microtubule dynamics through inhibition of a critical regulator or tubulin-associated protein. Furthermore, TH is not a major substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which is responsible for multidrug resistance in numerous cancers, providing a rationale to further study TH in cancers with Pgp-mediated treatment resistance. The identification of TH's molecular target in future studies will be of great value to the development of TH as potential treatment of multidrug-resistant tumors.""","""['Claire Levrier', 'Anja Rockstroh', 'Brian Gabrielli', 'Maria Kavallaris', 'Melanie Lehman', 'Rohan A Davis', 'Martin C Sadowski', 'Colleen C Nelson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['6α-Acetoxyanopterine: A Novel Structure Class of Mitotic Inhibitor Disrupting Microtubule Dynamics in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The primary antimitotic mechanism of action of the synthetic halichondrin E7389 is suppression of microtubule growth.', '2-Phenyl-5-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-1H-benzimidazole, a benzimidazole derivative, inhibits growth of human prostate cancer cells by affecting tubulin and c-Jun N-terminal kinase.', 'Spindle poisons and cell fate: a tale of two pathways.', 'Modulation of microtubule dynamics by drugs: a paradigm for the actions of cellular regulators.', 'Identification of Critical Molecular Factors and Side Effects Underlying the Response to Thalicthuberine in Prostate Cancer: A Systems Biology Approach.', 'CCNB1 and AURKA are critical genes for prostate cancer progression and castration-resistant prostate cancer resistant to vinblastine.', 'Anti-Tumor Efficiency of Perillylalcohol/β-Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complexes in a Sarcoma S180-Induced Mice Model.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Natural Products in Treatment of Cervical Cancer: A Review.', 'Dietary Compounds for Targeting Prostate Cancer.']"""

A technique of irradiation was developed to better preserve this function and has been evaluated.  Methods:   Eleven patients, with no erectile dysfunction (ED), were treated with daily IMRT-IGRT (total dose: 76-78 Gy). The pudendal arteries, penile bulb and cavernous body were delineated on the planning CT scan. The doses to these structures (with a 5 mm margin) were optimized to be as low as possible. The erectile function was documented using IIEF-5 scores at baseline, 6 months, 1 and 2 years. No ED was defined by an IIEF5 ≥ 20/25, a mild ED by an IIEF5 score of 17-19 and an important ED by a score <17.  Results:   The mean age was 68.4 years. At the median follow-up of 36 months, there was no biochemical relapse. Before RT, the mean IIEF5 score in all 11 patients was 23.4 (range, 20-25). At 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after RT, the mean IIEF scores were 21.2 (14-25), 21.3 (14-25), 21.8 (16-25) and 21.8 (16-25), respectively. At 2 years, 8 patients (72.7%) had no ED and 2 patients (18.2%) experienced a mild ED. The only patient with an important ED had a medical treatment and recovered a satisfactory IIEF score from 16 to 24.  Conclusion:   The results of this technique of optimisation for sexual preservation are encouraging. Despite a mean age close to 70 years at the time of treatment, 90.9% of the patients had no to mild ED at 2 years. This rate increases at 100% with medical treatment.

Robotic transducer placement may facilitate intrafractional motion compensation in radiation therapy. We consider integration with the CyberKnife and study whether the kinematic redundancy of a seven-degrees-of-freedom robot allows for acceptable plan quality for prostate treatments.  Methods:   Reference treatment plans were generated for 10 prostate cancer cases previously treated with the CyberKnife. Considering transducer and prostate motion by different safety margins, 10 different robot poses, and 3 different elbow configurations, we removed all beams colliding with robot or transducer. For each combination, plans were generated using the same strict dose constraints and the objective to maximize the target coverage. Additionally, plans for the union of all unblocked beams were generated.  Results:   In 9 cases the planning target coverage with the ultrasound robot was within 1.1 percentage points of the reference coverage. It was 1.7 percentage points for one large prostate. For one preferable robot position, kinematic redundancy decreased the average number of blocked beam directions from 23.1 to 14.5.  Conclusion:   The impact of beam blocking can largely be offset by treatment planning and using a kinematically redundant robot. Plan quality can be maintained by carefully choosing the ultrasound robot position and pose. For smaller planning target volumes the difference in coverage is negligible for safety margins of up to 35 mm.

Patients and methods:   This is a prospective cohort of men with intermediate- and high-risk PCa, captured in the population-based Prostate Cancer Outcome Registry Victoria, who were treated with definitive prostate RT between January 2010 and December 2015. The primary outcome of interest was ADT utilization. Chi-squared test for trend was used to evaluate the temporal trend in the use of ADT over the study period. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to evaluate the effects of patient-, tumour- and treatment-related factors, and treatment institutions (public/ private and metropolitan/ regional) on the likelihood of ADT utilization.  Results:   A total of 1806 men were included in the study, 199 of whom (11%) had favourable National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) intermediate-risk disease (i.e. only one intermediate-risk feature, primary Gleason grade 3, and <50% biopsy core involved), 687 (38%) had unfavourable NCCN intermediate-risk disease, and 920 (51%) had high-risk disease. Of the 1806 men, 1155 (64%) received ADT with RT. Men with NCCN high-risk PCa (84%) were more likely to have ADT than men with favourable NCCN intermediate-risk (32%) and unfavourable NCCN intermediate-risk (46%) PCa (P < 0.001). Men treated in public institutions (66%, vs 47% in private institutions; P < 0.001) and regional centres (78%, vs 59% in metropolitan institutions; P < 0.001) were more likely to receive ADT. There was a trend towards an increase in ADT utilization from 50% in 2010 to 64% in 2015 (P < 0.001). In multivariate analyses (adjusting for age, tumour-related factors, year of treatment and use of brachytherapy boost), treatment institution (public and regional) remained independently associated with increased likelihood of ADT utilization. Men with intermediate-risk PCa treated in regional and public institutions were 2.7 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-3.9; P < 0.001) and 2.8 times (95% CI 1.4-5.3; P = 0.002), more likely to receive ADT with RT, respectively, while men with high-risk PCa treated in regional and public institutions were 3.1 times (95% CI 1.7-5.7; P < 0.001) and 3.0 times (95% CI 1.7-5.4; P < 0.001), more likely to receive ADT with RT, respectively.  Conclusion:   This is the largest Australasian contemporary series reporting on the pattern of use of ADT with definitive prostate RT. While there was an increasing trend towards use of ADT over time, ADT still appeared to be underutilized in certain groups of patients who may benefit from ADT, with approximately one in five men with high-risk and one in two with unfavourable intermediate-risk PCa not receiving ADT with RT.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its role in colorectal cancer remain largely unknown. The aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between miR-133a-3p and SENP1 in colorectal cancer cells. We found that miR-133a-3p expression was downregulated in colorectal cancer tissues. In silico analyses indicated that SENP1 is one of the target genes of miR-133a-3p. Overexpression of miR-133a-3p mimics was able to inhibit cell growth with G1 arrest of colorectal cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-133a-3p antisense promoted cell growth of colorectal cancer cells. The luciferase reporter experiments showed that miR-133a-3p regulated the expression of SENP1 by combining with its 3'-UTR and resulted in downregulation of SENP1 and upregulation of CDK inhibitors such as p16, p19, p21, and p27.

One-quarter of those treated with RP experience biochemical failure and are subsequently offered salvage radiotherapy (SRT) to the prostatic bed. The aim of this study was to elucidate long-term LUTS after surgery and SRT.  Materials and methods:   Urodynamic parameters from 16 patients treated with RP and subsequent SRT in the period 2000-2010 were evaluated with uroflowmetry, filling cystometry, pressure-flow and urethral pressure profile (UPP). In conjunction with the urodynamic examination, all patients completed the Danish Prostatic Symptom Score (DAN-PSS) questionnaire, which evaluates the grade of LUTS.  Results:   Median time from SRT to urodynamic examination was 7.7 years (range 5.8-10.0 years). The following urodynamic parameters were affected: bladder volume at maximal cystometric capacity, bladder compliance, bladder function, bladder outlet obstruction and UPP. The total DAN-PSS index combining all symptoms and their corresponding impact on patients was mild in six patients (≤ 7 points), moderate in seven patients (8-19 points) and severe in three patients (≥ 20 points).  Conclusions:   This urodynamic study is one of the first to evaluate long-term urodynamic characteristics in patients treated with SRT. Several urodynamic parameters were affected. This indicates that SRT primarily affects bladder compliance, maximal cystometric capacity and bladder outlet obstruction.

The density of the microparticles is determined by using a neutrally buoyant selection process that involves centrifuging of microparticles suspended in different density solutions, CsCl for microbeads and Percoll for cells. The speed of sound at 3 MHz in the neutrally buoyant suspensions is measured as a function of the microparticle volume fraction, and from this the compressibility of the microparticles is inferred. Finally, from the obtained compressibility and density, the acoustic scattering coefficients and contrast factor of the microparticles are determined, and in a sensitivity analysis, the impact of the measurement errors on the computed acoustic properties is reported. The determination of these parameters and their uncertainties allow for accurate predictions of the acoustophoretic response of the microparticles. The method is validated by determining the density (0.1-1% relative uncertainty) and compressibility (1-3% relative uncertainty) of previously well-characterized polymer microbeads and subsequently applied to determine the density (0.1-1% relative uncertainty), compressibility (1% relative uncertainty), scattering coefficients, and acoustic contrast factors for nonfixed and fixed cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, DU-145 prostate cancer cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and LU-HNSCC-25 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells in phosphate buffered saline.

AIM1 strongly associates with the actin cytoskeleton in prostate epithelial cells in normal tissues, but not in prostate cancers.

This study examines the value of PSMA-informed SRT in improving treatment outcomes in the context of biochemical failure after RP. Methods: We analyzed men with rising PSA after RP with PSA readings between 0.05 and 1.0 ng/mL, considered eligible for SRT at the time of PSMA. For each patient, clinical and pathologic features as well as scan results, including site of PSMA-positive disease, number of lesions, and a certainty score, were documented. Subsequent management, including SRT, and most recent PSA were recorded using medical records. Treatment response was defined as both PSA ≤ 0.1 ng/mL and >50% reduction in PSA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for association of clinical variables and treatment response to SRT. Results: One hundred sixty-four men were included. PSMA was positive in 62% (n = 102/164): 38 of 102 in the prostatic fossa, 41 of 102 in pelvic nodes, and 23 of 102 distantly. Twenty-four patients received androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and were excluded for outcomes analysis. In total, 99 of 146 received SRT with a median follow-up after radiation treatment of 10.5 mo (interquartile range, 6-14 mo). Overall treatment response after SRT was 72% (n = 71/99). Forty-five percent (n = 27/60) of patients with a negative PSMA underwent SRT whereas 55% (33/60) did not. In men with a negative PSMA who received SRT, 85% (n = 23/27) demonstrated a treatment response, compared with a further PSA increase in 65% (22/34) in those not treated. In 36 of 99 patients with disease confined to the prostate fossa on PSMA, 81% (n = 29/36) responded to SRT. In total, 26 of 99 men had nodal disease on PSMA, of whom 61% (n = 16/26) had treatment response after SRT. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, PSMA and serum PSA significantly correlated with treatment response, whereas pT stage, Gleason score, and surgical margin status did not. Conclusion: PSMA PET is independently predictive of treatment response to SRT and stratifies men into a high treatment response to SRT (negative or fossa-confined PSMA) versus men with poor response to SRT (nodes or distant-disease PSMA).

The aim of our study was to evaluate biochemical recurrence (BCR) after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and ePLND in prostate cancer patients, stratified by the application of SNB. The results were compared with the predictions of the updated Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram. Methods: Between January 2006 and November 2016, 920 patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and ePLND with or without SNB (184 and 736 patients, respectively). BCR was defined as 2 consecutive prostate-specific antigen rises of at least 0.2 ng/mL. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analyses were used to identify predictors of BCR. Results: Median follow-up was 28 mo (interquartile range, 13-56.7 mo). The 5-y BCR-free survival rate was 80.5% and 69.9% in the ePLND+SNB and ePLND groups, respectively. At multivariate analysis, prostate-specific antigen level, primary Gleason grade greater than 3, seminal vesicle invasion, and higher number of removed and positive nodes were independent predictors of BCR in the ePLND group. In the ePLND+SNB group, only the number of positive nodes was an independent predictor of BCR. The overall accuracy of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram was higher in the ePLND+SNB than in the ePLND group. However, the nomogram was underestimating the probability of BCR-free status in the ePLND+SNB group, whereas the ePLND group was performing as predicted. Conclusion: Adding SNB to ePLND improves BCR-free survival, although the precise explanation of this observation remains speculative. Our results should be interpreted cautiously, given the nonrandomized nature and the selection bias of the study.""","""['Nikolaos Grivas', 'Esther M K Wit', 'Teele Kuusk', 'Gijs H KleinJan', 'Maarten L Donswijk', 'Fijs W B van Leeuwen', 'Henk G van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Validation and head-to-head comparison of three nomograms predicting probability of lymph node invasion of prostate cancer in patients undergoing extended and/or sentinel lymph node dissection.', 'Diagnostic Value, Oncologic Outcomes, and Safety Profile of Image-Guided Surgery Technologies During Robot-Assisted Lymph Node Dissection with Sentinel Node Biopsy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy and Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Patients with Locally-advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Sentinel Node Procedure in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review to Assess Diagnostic Accuracy.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer: indications, extent and tailored approaches.', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Techniques in Urologic Oncology: Current Knowledge and Application.', 'Diagnostic Value of Radio-Guided Sentinel Node Detection in Patients with Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy with Modified-Extended Lymphadenectomy.', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Patients: Results From an Injection Technique Targeting the Index Lesion in the Prostate Gland.', 'Fluorescence-guided radical prostatectomy.', 'Utility of Lymphadenectomy in Prostate Cancer: Where Do We Stand?']"""

As part of a study conducted to explore the quality of preventive care, we investigated general practitioners' (GPs) views on the usefulness of feedback and their preferences regarding how feedback is provided.  Methods:   This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015 among randomly selected community-based GPs in two regions of Switzerland and France. GPs were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire about how often they provided 12 measures of preventive care: blood pressure, weight and height measurements, screening for dyslipidemia, at-risk drinking (and advice to reduce for at-risk drinkers), smoking (and advice to stop for smokers), colon and prostate cancer, and influenza immunization for patients >65 years and at-risk patients. They were also asked to estimate the usefulness of a feedback regarding their preventive care practice, reason(s) for which a feedback could be useful, and finally, to state which type of feedback they would like to receive. Chi-square tests were used to compare frequencies. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with GPs considering feedback as useful.  Results:   Five hundred eighteen of 1100 GPs (47.1%) returned the questionnaire. They were predominantly men (62.5%) and most (40.1%) were aged between 55 and 64 years old. Overall, 44.3% stated that a feedback would be useful. Younger GPs and those carrying out more measures of preventive care were more likely to consider feedback useful. The two main reasons for being interested in feedback were to receive knowledge about the study results and to modify or improve practice. The two preferred feedback interventions were a brief report and a report with specific information regarding prevention best practice, whereas less than 1% would like to discuss the results face-to-face with the study investigators.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that GPs have preferences regarding the types of feedback they would like to receive. Because the implementation of guidelines is highly related to the acceptance of feedback, we strongly encourage decision makers to take GPs' preferences into account when developing strategies to implement guidelines, in order to improve the quality of primary care.""","""['Paul Sebo', 'Hubert Maisonneuve', 'Jean-Pascal Fournier', 'Nicolas Senn', 'Dagmar M Haller']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Implement Sci""","""['How do general practitioners put preventive care recommendations into practice?

Methods:   To better understand the impact of ERCC1 protein expression in human prostate cancer, a preexisting tissue microarray (TMA) containing more than 12,000 prostate cancer specimens was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and data were compared with tumor phenotype, PSA recurrence and several of the most common genomic alterations (TMPRSS2:ERG fusions: deletions of PTEN, 6q, 5q, 3p).  Results:   ERCC1 staining was seen in 64.7% of 10,436 interpretable tissues and was considered weak in 37.1%, moderate in 22.6% and strong in 5% of tumors. High-level ERCC1 staining was linked to advanced pT stage, high Gleason grade, positive lymph nodes, high pre-operative serum PSA, and positive surgical margin status (p < 0.0001 each). High ERCC1 expression was strongly associated with an elevated risk of PSA recurrence (p < 0.0001). This was independent of established prognostic features. A subgroup analysis of cancers defined by comparable quantitative Gleason grades revealed that the prognostic impact was mostly driven by low-grade tumors with a Gleason 3 + 3 or 3 + 4 (Gleason 4: ≤5%). High ERCC1 expression was strongly associated with the presence of genomic alterations and expression levels increased with the number of deletions present in the tumor. These latter data suggest a functional relationship of ERCC1 expression with genomic instability.  Conclusion:   The results of our study demonstrate that expression of ERCC1 - a potential surrogate for genomic instability - is an independent prognostic marker in prostate cancer with particular importance in low-grade tumors.""","""['Frank Jacobsen', 'Billurvan Taskin', 'Nathaniel Melling', 'Charlotte Sauer', 'Corinna Wittmer', 'Claudia Hube-Magg', 'Martina Kluth', 'Ronald Simon', 'Dirk Pehrke', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Imke Thederan', 'Guido Sauter', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Waldemar Wilczak', 'Katharina Möller', 'Sören A Weidemann', 'Susanne Burdak-Rothkamm']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The prognostic value of SUMO1/Sentrin specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) in prostate cancer is limited to ERG-fusion positive tumors lacking PTEN deletion.', 'Overexpression of the A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase ADAM15 is linked to a Small but Highly Aggressive Subset of Prostate Cancers.', 'Down-Regulation of S100A8 is an Independent Predictor of PSA Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Treated by Radical Prostatectomy.', 'βIII-tubulin overexpression is an independent predictor of prostate cancer progression tightly linked to ERG fusion status and PTEN deletion.', 'Genomic Features and Clinical Implications of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Increased ABCC4 Expression Induced by ERRα Leads to Docetaxel Resistance via Efflux of Docetaxel in Prostate Cancer.', 'The prognostic value of excision repair cross-complementing Group 1 expression in nasopharyngeal cancer patients.', 'DNA repair in cancer initiation, progression, and therapy-a double-edged sword.']"""

However, the conventional diagnostic trans-rectal ultrasound guided biopsies (TRUS-bx) underestimate PCa aggressiveness in almost half of the cases, when compared with the surgical specimen. Purpose To investigate if additional multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate and MRI-guided in-bore biopsies (MRGB) at AS inclusion would improve selection of patients for active treatment. Material and Methods All patients enrolled in AS programs at two Danish centers, from October 2014 to January 2016, were offered an mpMRI 8-12 weeks after the initial diagnostic TRUS-bx. Candidates had low-risk disease (PSA < 10 ng/mL, <cT2b, Gleason score [GS] < 7). Prostate lesions were scored on the five-point PIRADS scale (version 1 and 2). MRGB were performed on PIRADS 4 or 5 lesions. Significant cancer was defined as GS > 6 or GS 6 (3 + 3) lesions with ≥ 6 mm maximal cancer core length (MCCL). Results A total of 78 patients were included and in 21 patients a total of 22 PIRADS-score 4 or 5 lesions were detected. MRGB pathology revealed that 17 (81%) of these and 22% of the entire AS population harbored significant cancers at AS inclusion. In eight (38%) cases, the GS was upgraded. Also, nine patients (43%) had GS 6 (3 + 3) foci with MCCL ≥ 6 mm.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The number of harvested and positive LNs and their influence on biochemical recurrence-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and cancer-specific survival was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox regressions. The number of harvested LNs was used as a continuous and dichotomous variable with a cut-off of 13 LNs.  Results and limitations:   The mean (median) number of removed LNs was 15.0 (13) and the mean (median) number of positive LNs was 2.4 (1). In multivariate analysis, the number of removed LNs did not significantly influence oncologic outcomes (biochemical recurrence, metastasis-free survival, or cancer-specific survival).

Following publication, the receipt of curative treatment was significantly lower (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.99; p=0.05) among men with at least two cardiometabolic comorbidities, in contrast to the increasing trend (p=0.02) noted prior to PIVOT.

The off-treatment time for patients depends on cancer progression, often measured as a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA).  Objective:   To evaluate if certain factors can predict OTP duration following 7-mo degarelix therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This multivariable analysis included 191 prostate cancer patients with baseline PSA 4-50 ng/ml or PSA doubling time <24 mo entering the first OTP with PSA ≤4 ng/ml and testosterone <0.5 ng/ml. OTP continued until disease progression, measured as PSA >4 ng/ml. Despite a study-defined OTP maximum of 24 mo, a 50% failure rate was not observed within certain strata. A Weibull distribution was used to estimate median time to PSA >4 ng/ml adjusted for the following variables: age; baseline (or end of induction period [EOI]) PSA; baseline testosterone; cancer stage/previous curative treatment; and Gleason score. According to the results and the utility of these factors in clinical practice, the model was reduced in a stepwise manner. Time to testosterone recovery (testosterone >0.5 and >2.2 ng/ml) was estimated in a similar manner.  Results:   The full five-factor model showed that baseline PSA (p<0.0001), age (p=0.004), prostate cancer stage/previous therapy (p=0.023), and baseline testosterone (p=0.039) influenced OTP. A reduced two-factor model (baseline PSA, age) showed that only baseline PSA influenced OTP (p<0.0001), and patients with baseline PSA ≤4 ng/ml had the longest OTP. In addition, EOI PSA (p<0.0001) and age (p=0.050) significantly influenced OTP. The times to testosterone >0.5 and >2.2 ng/ml were longer for older patients and those with lower baseline testosterone levels.  Conclusion:   Patients with lower baseline and EOI PSA, and older patients can stay off therapy longer and therefore may benefit more from degarelix IAD. These factors may help in proposing an algorithm to predict the OTP and optimise visit frequency.  Patient summary:   We describe extended analysis results for a trial in which patients with prostate cancer received intermittent androgen deprivation treatment. Prostate-specific antigen levels at baseline and at the end of the induction period, as well as older age, predicted the duration of the off-treatment period. Testosterone recovery was slower in older patients and in patients who had lower pretreatment testosterone levels. These factors may help in deciding whether to choose continuous or intermittent treatment as a strategy.
