Objectives:   To quantify the prevalence of families that fulfill the Amsterdam I or II criteria for Lynch syndrome in the Utah population and investigate the risk of colonic and extracolonic cancers in family members and their relatives.  Design, setting, and participants:   In a population-based study, 202 families with Amsterdam I and II criteria–positive pedigrees in the Utah Population Database were identified. Of these, all cancer diagnoses in members of families with Amsterdam criteria and their first-degree, second-degree, and first-cousin relatives were located through linkage to the Utah Cancer Registry. The study was conducted from May 1 to June 30, 2016.  Main outcomes and measures:   Standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) were estimated by comparing the observed rates of cancer in relatives with population-expected rates estimated internally from the Utah Population Database.  Results:   A total of 202 families meeting Amsterdam criteria for Lynch syndrome accounted for 2.6% of all colorectal cancers in the state; of these, 59 met both the Amsterdam I and Amsterdam II criteria. Cancers observed in significant excess in the first-degree relatives of Amsterdam criteria pedigrees included colorectal (SMR, 10.10; 95% CI, 9.43-10.81), endometrial (SMR, 5.89; 95% CI, 5.09-6.78), stomach (SMR, 2.90; 95% CI, 2.02-4.03), small intestine (SMR, 7.72; 95% CI, 5.17-11.08), prostate (SMR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.73-2.17), kidney (SMR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.45-4.16), urinary bladder (SMR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.22-2.12), thyroid (SMR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.55-3.17), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.64-2.65). Risks of colorectal and endometrial cancers were also found to be elevated in second-degree (SMR, 4.31; 95% CI, 3.98-4.65 and SMR, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.30-3.14, respectively) and first-cousin (SMR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.70-2.00 and SMR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.29-1.73, respectively) relatives of families with Amsterdam criteria.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this population-based study of cancer risk in families fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria, many of the cancers previously reported to be associated with Lynch syndrome were observed, several previously unreported cancer associations were noted, and the risk of colorectal and endometrial cancer were markedly increased in first-, second-, and even third-degree relatives of these families. This study provides clinicians with population-based, unbiased data to counsel members of families meeting the Amsterdam criteria regarding their elevated risks of cancer and the importance of cancer screening.""","""['N Jewel Samadder', 'Ken Robert Smith', 'Jathine Wong', 'Alun Thomas', 'Heidi Hanson', 'Kenneth Boucher', 'Cathryn Kopituch', 'Lisa A Cannon-Albright', 'Randall W Burt', 'Karen Curtin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Misclassification of Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma in Patients With Lynch Syndrome.', 'Misclassification of Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma in Patients With Lynch Syndrome-Reply.', 'Extracolonic cancers associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer in the Utah Population Database.', 'Extent of Pedigree Required to Screen for and Diagnose Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer: Comparison of Simplified and Extended Pedigrees.', 'Lower cancer incidence in Amsterdam-I criteria families without mismatch repair deficiency: familial colorectal cancer type X.', 'Current and emerging trends in Lynch syndrome identification in women with endometrial cancer.', 'Colorectal Carcinoma with Suspected Lynch Syndrome: A Multidisciplinary Algorithm.', 'The MSH2 c.793-1G>A variant disrupts normal splicing and is associated with Lynch syndrome.', 'Personalized Systemic Therapies in Hereditary Cancer Syndromes.', 'Genetic Predisposition to Colorectal Cancer: How Many and Which Genes to Test?', 'Incidental screening of descending colon carcinoma by 18F-FDG PET/MR imaging in a patient with endometrial carcinoma: A case report of Lynch syndrome.', 'Relative Risk of Bladder and Kidney Cancer in Lynch Syndrome: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

A series of DNA plasmids encoding human PSA, IL-12, and their conjugates was constructed and injected into female mice intramuscularly, followed by an electric pulse. The humoral and cellular immune responses after immunization were detected by ELISA and ELISPOT, respectively. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of these plasmids, a mouse model with a PSA-expressing tumor was constructed. Mice vaccinated with PSA-IL-12 plasmids elicited the strongest PSA-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Furthermore, these vaccinations inhibited the growth of PSA-expressing tumors and prolonged mouse survival. These observations emphasize the potential of the IL-12 gene as an intramolecular adjuvant for DNA vaccines.

The cost of generating accurate reference standards for medical image segmentation can be substantial. Since the study cost and the likelihood of detecting a clinically meaningful difference in accuracy both depend on the size and on the quality of the study reference standard, balancing these trade-offs supports the efficient use of research resources. In this work, we derive a statistical power calculation that enables researchers to estimate the appropriate sample size to detect clinically meaningful differences in segmentation accuracy (i.e. the proportion of voxels matching the reference standard) between two algorithms. Furthermore, we derive a formula to relate reference standard errors to their effect on the sample sizes of studies using lower-quality (but potentially more affordable and practically available) reference standards. The accuracy of the derived sample size formula was estimated through Monte Carlo simulation, demonstrating, with 95% confidence, a predicted statistical power within 4% of simulated values across a range of model parameters. This corresponds to sample size errors of less than 4 subjects and errors in the detectable accuracy difference less than 0.6%. The applicability of the formula to real-world data was assessed using bootstrap resampling simulations for pairs of algorithms from the PROMISE12 prostate MR segmentation challenge data set. The model predicted the simulated power for the majority of algorithm pairs within 4% for simulated experiments using a high-quality reference standard and within 6% for simulated experiments using a low-quality reference standard. A case study, also based on the PROMISE12 data, illustrates using the formulae to evaluate whether to use a lower-quality reference standard in a prostate segmentation study.""","""['Eli Gibson', 'Yipeng Hu', 'Henkjan J Huisman', 'Dean C Barratt']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Evaluation of prostate segmentation algorithms for MRI: the PROMISE12 challenge.', 'The impact of registration accuracy on imaging validation study design: A novel statistical power calculation.', 'Simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE): an algorithm for the validation of image segmentation.', ""Statistical approaches for modeling radiologists' interpretive performance."", 'A systematic review of the reporting of sample size calculations and corresponding data components in observational functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.', 'Towards a guideline for evaluation metrics in medical image segmentation.', 'Diagnosis of Leukaemia in Blood Slides Based on a Fine-Tuned and Highly Generalisable Deep Learning Model.', 'Automatic brain lesion segmentation on standard magnetic resonance images: a scoping review.', 'Fully automated brain resection cavity delineation for radiation target volume definition in glioblastoma patients using deep learning.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate MRI using convolutional neural networks: Investigating the impact of network architecture on the accuracy of volume measurement and MRI-ultrasound registration.']"""

Materials and methods:   We evaluated the characteristics of lesions in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens, compared the differences between lesions detected and undetected by systematic transperineal ultrasonography-guided 11-region biopsy with regard to tumour volume, Gleason score, surgical margin, spatial location and clinical significance, and assessed the potential impact of undetected clinically significant lesions.  Results:   The median number of biopsy cores was 24. Sixty-four percent of the clinically significant lesions (170/264) were detected. There were significant differences between the detected and undetected lesions in tumour volume, Gleason score and clinical significance. Inconsistencies found in lesion position between biopsy and RP specimens in the anterior and posterior zones and the left and right sides was 3.4% (7/203) and 5.4% (11/203), respectively. Of the 129 patients, 13 (10.1%) were found to have undetected clinically significant lesions in the biopsy lying on the same side but in a different zone from the detected clinically significant lesions, whereas 23 patients (17.8%) had undetected clinically significant lesions in the biopsy lying on the opposite side from the detected clinically significant lesions.  Conclusions:   Template-guided transperineal saturation prostate biopsy detected approximately two-thirds of clinically significant lesions. Most of the undetected lesions were those with small tumour volume. Approximately 20-30% of patients had clinically significant undetected lesions in a different lobe or different quadrant from the detected lesions in the biopsy.""","""['Zhipeng Mai', 'Yu Xiao', 'Weigang Yan', 'Yi Zhou', 'Zhien Zhou', 'Zhiyong Liang', 'Zhigang Ji', 'Hanzhong Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Transperineal template-guided saturation biopsy aimed at sampling one core for each milliliter of prostate volume: 103 cases requiring repeat prostate biopsy.', 'Comparison of free-hand transperineal mpMRI/TRUS fusion-guided biopsy with transperineal 12-core systematic biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a single-center prospective study in China.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Index Tumor Detection: Correlation with Radical Prostatectomy Specimen.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', ""Perineal prostatic tumour seedling after 'Tru-Cut' needle biopsy: case report and review of the literature."", 'Application of single-point prostate biopsy in elderly patients with highly suspected prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of a Personalized Prostate Biopsy Pattern With Traditional Transrectal Prostate Biopsy: Different Cancer Detection Rate.', 'The application of a targeted periprostatic nerve block in transperineal template-guided prostate biopsies.', 'Pelvic plexus block to provide better anesthesia in transperineal template-guided prostate biopsy: a randomised controlled trial.', 'Multiparametric ultrasound: evaluation of greyscale, shear wave elastography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound for prostate cancer detection and localization in correlation to radical prostatectomy specimens.']"""

ACSL3 is expressed in both androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, its role in prostate cancer remains elusive. We overexpressed ACSL3 in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and examined the downstream effectors of ACSL3. Furthermore, we examined the role of ACSL3 in the androgen metabolism of prostate cancer. ACSL3 overexpression led to upregulation of several genes such as aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) involved in steroidogenesis, which utilizes adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) as substrate, and downregulated androgen-inactivating enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2 (UGT2B). Exposure to DHEAS significantly increased testosterone levels and cell proliferative response in ACSL3-overexpressing cells when compared to that in control cells. A public database showed that ACSL3 level was higher in CRPC than in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. CRPC cells showed an increased expression of ACSL3 and an expression pattern of AKR1C3 and UGT2B similar to ACSL3-overexpressing cells. DHEAS stimulation significantly promoted the proliferation of CRPC cells when compared to that of LNCaP cells. These findings suggest that ACSL3 contributes to the growth of CRPC through intratumoral steroidogenesis (i.e. promoting androgen synthesis from DHEAS and preventing the catabolism of active androgens).""","""['Toshiro Migita', 'Ken-Ichi Takayama', 'Tomohiko Urano', 'Daisuke Obinata', 'Kazutaka Ikeda', 'Tomoyoshi Soga', 'Satoru Takahashi', 'Satoshi Inoue']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Overexpression of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) in LNCaP cells diverts androgen metabolism towards testosterone resulting in resistance to the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride.', 'Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) is a biomarker and therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'The DHEA-sulfate depot following P450c17 inhibition supports the case for AKR1C3 inhibition in high risk localized and advanced castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.', 'The mechanism of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 3 in inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Construction of a fatty acid metabolism-related gene signature for predicting prognosis and immune response in breast cancer.', 'miR-202-5p Inhibits Lipid Metabolism and Steroidogenesis of Goose Hierarchical Granulosa Cells by Targeting ACSL3.']"""

Strategies to identify patients likely to respond well to a given therapy could significantly improve health care outcomes by maximizing clinical benefits while reducing toxicities and adverse effects. Using a glycan microarray assay, we recently reported that pretreatment serum levels of IgM specific to blood group A trisaccharide (BG-Atri) correlate positively with overall survival of cancer patients on PROSTVAC-VF therapy. The results suggested anti-BG-Atri IgM measured prior to treatment could serve as a biomarker for identifying patients likely to benefit from PROSTVAC-VF. For continued development and clinical application of serum IgM specific to BG-Atri as a predictive biomarker, a clinical assay was needed. In this study, we developed and validated a Luminex-based clinical assay for measuring serum IgM specific to BG-Atri. IgM levels were measured with the Luminex assay and compared to levels measured using the microarray for 126 healthy individuals and 77 prostate cancer patients. This assay provided reproducible and consistent results with low %CVs, and tolerance ranges were established for the assay. IgM levels measured using the Luminex assay were found to be highly correlated to the microarray results with R values of 0.93-0.95. This assay is a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) and is suitable for evaluating thousands of serum samples in CLIA certified laboratories that have validated the assay.

Metformin in combination with atorvastatin had stronger effects on growth inhibition and apoptosis in PC-3 cells than either drug alone. The combination also potently inhibited cell migration and the formation of tumorspheres. Metformin and atorvastatin in combination had a potent inhibitory effect on nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) activity and caused strong decreases in the expression of its downstream anti-apoptotic gene Survivin.

Of the synthetic flavonoids, compounds 4a and g showed good inhibitory activity (IC50 was 16.8 and 21.8 µM, respectively), and were cytotoxic toward human pancreatic (PANC1) and prostate (DU145) cancer cells in which Hh signaling was activated. Compounds 4a and g had moderate selectivity against PANC1 cells. Western blotting analyses revealed that PTCH and GLI1 expression was reduced after treatment with these compounds.

We found that men with prostate cancers expressing high levels of the G protein-coupled receptor LGR4 had a significantly shorter recurrence-free survival compared with patients with cancers having low LGR4 expression. LGR4 expression was elevated in human prostate cancer cell lines with metastatic potential. We therefore generated a novel transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse model to investigate the role of Lgr4 in prostate cancer development and metastasis in vivo TRAMP Lgr4-/- mice exhibited an initial delay in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia formation, but the frequency of tumor formation was equivalent between TRAMP and TRAMP Lgr4-/- mice by 12 weeks. The loss of Lgr4 significantly improved TRAMP mouse survival and dramatically reduced the occurrence of lung metastases. LGR4 knockdown impaired the migration, invasion, and colony formation of DU145 cells and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as demonstrated by up-regulation of E-cadherin and decreased expression of the EMT transcription factors ZEB, Twist, and Snail. Overexpression of LGR4 in LNCaP cells had the opposite effects. Orthotopic injection of DU145 cells stably expressing shRNA targeting LGR4 resulted in decreased xenograft tumor size, reduced tumor EMT marker expression, and impaired metastasis, in accord with our findings in TRAMP Lgr4-/- mice. In conclusion, we propose that Lgr4 is a key protein necessary for prostate cancer EMT and metastasis.""","""['Weijia Luo', 'Peng Tan', 'Melissa Rodriguez', 'Lian He', 'Kunrong Tan', 'Li Zeng', 'Stefan Siwko', 'Mingyao Liu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['The Role of LGR4 (GPR48) in Normal and Cancer Processes.', 'LGR4 modulates breast cancer initiation, metastasis, and cancer stem cells.', 'CX3CL1 increases invasiveness and metastasis by promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through the TACE/TGF-α/EGFR pathway in hypoxic androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'MiR-218 impedes IL-6-induced prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion via suppression of LGR4 expression.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging Roles for LGR4 in Organ Development, Energy Metabolism and Carcinogenesis.', 'Role of Calcium Homeostasis in Modulating EMT in Cancer.', 'A Wnt-Independent LGR4-EGFR Signaling Axis in Cancer Metastasis.', 'The Role of LGR4 (GPR48) in Normal and Cancer Processes.']"""

This study aimed to determine if androgen deprivation is associated with increased risk of anemia in patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Methods:   This was a population-based cohort study using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics repository. The cohort consisted of 10,364 men newly diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 1 April 1998 and 30 September 2015. We used time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for anemia (hemoglobin <130 g/L) associated with current and past use of androgen deprivation therapy, compared with nonuse.  Results:   There were 3,651 incident anemia events during 31,574 person-years of follow-up (rate: 11.6/100 person-years). Current androgen deprivation therapy use was associated with a nearly three-fold increased hazard of anemia, compared with nonuse (23.5 vs. 5.9 per 100 person-years, respectively; HR: 2.90, 95% CI: 2.67, 3.16). The HR was elevated in the first 6 months of use (HR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.95, 2.48) and continued to be elevated with longer durations of use. Past androgen deprivation therapy use was associated with a lower estimate (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.43), which returned closer to the null ≥25 months after treatment discontinuation (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.79, 1.15).

Methods:   Forty consecutive patients undergoing either RALP or ORRP were prospectively included to assess the extent of systemic response. Blood samples were collected before surgery (T1), at the time of prostatectomy (T2), at the time of wound closure (T3), and 12 h (T4), 24 h (T5), and 48 h (T6) after surgery, and assayed for interleukins (IL-6 and IL-10), C-reactive protein (CRP), and hemoglobin. A 2-sided p < 0.05 was considered to indicate significance.  Results:   Baseline levels of IL-6, IL-10, and CRP were comparable in both arms of the study. IL-6 and IL-10 increased in both groups during surgery and reached maximum levels at 12 and 24 h after surgery. The RALP and RRP groups differed significantly at T2 (p = 0.009), T3 (p = 0.046), T5 (p = 0.05) and T6 (p = 0.0007) for IL-6, and at T3 (p = 0.05) and T4 (p = 0.05) for IL-10. CRP levels differed significantly at 48 h postoperative (p = 0.0053). The maximum levels of all 3 mediators in the RALP group were significantly lower than those in the open surgery group. Patients in the RALP group experienced less pain from day 2 to 4 according to the Visual Analog Scale (p < 0.05).

In addition, plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) have been shown to be closely related to tumor progression in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colonel cancer. However, the relationships between LDH and CK levels with metastasis occurrence and the survival status of lung cancer patients remain unclear.  Experimental design:   A total of 1142 lung cancer patients were enrolled in this study and were separated into negative or positive groups, according to the plasma levels of CK or LDH. Patients in both groups were assessed for clinical characteristics, metastasis occurrence, and survival status. The Cox regression model was then introduced to confirm whether CK and LDH could act as independent factors for predicting a poor prognosis.  Results:   The results indicated that CK had a close relationship with bone (p < 0.05) and lymph node (p < 0.05) metastases. In addition, LDH was strongly related with bone (p < 0.05), adrenal gland (p < 0.05), and lymph node (p < 0.05) metastases. CK and LDH were also correlated with the survival status of the lung cancer patients (all p < 0.001). According to specific histological classification analysis, it was found that CK was closely related to the survival status of adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients, while LDH was only correlated with that of ADC patients. Cox regression analysis confirmed that CK and LDH could act as independent factors for predicting a poor prognosis in ADC but not SCC patients.  Conclusions:   For the first time, our study confirmed the role of CK in metastasis occurrence and the survival status of lung cancer patients. In addition, it also demonstrated that CK and LDH could be used as independent factors to predict a poor prognosis in ADC patients. The identification of CK and LDH will play important roles in lung cancer diagnosis and poor outcome prediction in the future.""","""['Lei Liu', 'Ying He', 'Ge Ge', 'Lei Li', 'Ping Zhou', 'Yihan Zhu', 'Huairong Tang', 'Yan Huang', 'Weimin Li', 'Li Zhang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Analysis of prognostic factors in 68 patients with cancer of unknown primary site.', 'The important role of circulating CYFRA21-1 in metastasis diagnosis and prognostic value compared with carcinoembryonic antigen and neuron-specific enolase in lung cancer patients.', 'Overexpression of CHD1L is positively associated with metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma and predicts patients poor survival.', 'Metastases to the kidney from primary lung cancer : clinicopathological analysis of six cases in a single center.', 'Rationale for LDH-targeted cancer immunotherapy.', 'A high serum creatine kinase (CK)-MB-to-total-CK ratio in patients with pancreatic cancer: a novel application of a traditional marker in predicting malignancy of pancreatic masses?', 'Understanding the Contribution of Lactate Metabolism in Cancer Progress: A Perspective from Isomers.', 'A Metabolism-Related Gene Prognostic Index Bridging Metabolic Signatures and Antitumor Immune Cycling in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Preoperative low serum creatine kinase is associated with poor overall survival in the male patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Metabolic consequences of perioperative oral carbohydrates in breast cancer patients - an explorative study.']"""

ONC201 is a first-in-class small molecule imipridone in Phase I/II clinical trials for advanced cancer. We have previously shown that ONC201 targets self-renewing, chemotherapy-resistant colorectal CSCs via Akt/ERK inhibition and DR5/TRAIL induction. In this study, we demonstrate that the anti-CSC effects of ONC201 involve early changes in stem cell-related gene expression prior to tumor cell death induction. A targeted network analysis of gene expression profiles in colorectal cancer cells revealed that ONC201 downregulates stem cell pathways such as Wnt signaling and modulates genes (ID1, ID2, ID3 and ALDH7A1) known to regulate self-renewal in colorectal, prostate cancer and glioblastoma. ONC201-mediated changes in CSC-related gene expression were validated at the RNA and protein level for each tumor type. Accordingly, we observed inhibition of self-renewal and CSC markers in prostate cancer cell lines and patient-derived glioblastoma cells upon ONC201 treatment. Interestingly, ONC201-mediated CSC depletion does not occur in colorectal cancer cells with acquired resistance to ONC201. Finally, we observed that basal expression of CSC-related genes (ID1, CD44, HES7 and TCF3) significantly correlate with ONC201 efficacy in >1000 cancer cell lines and combining the expression of multiple genes leads to a stronger overall prediction.

KIM increases the accuracy of prostate radiation therapy treatments and allows for hypofractionation. However, an additional imaging dose is delivered to the patient. A standardized procedure to determine the imaging dose per frame delivered using KIM was developed and applied at four radiation therapy centers on three different types of linear accelerator.  Methods:   Dose per frame for kilovoltage imaging in fluoroscopy mode was measured in air at isocenter using an ion chamber. Beam quality and dose were determined for a Varian Clinac iX linear accelerator, a Varian Trilogy, four Varian Truebeams and one Elekta Synergy at four different radiation therapy centers. The imaging parameters used on the Varian machines were 125 kV, 80 mA, and 13 ms. The Elekta machine was measured at 120 kV, 80 mA, and 12 ms. Absorbed doses to the skin and the prostate for a typical SBRT prostate treatment length were estimated according to the IPEMB protocol.  Results:   The average dose per kV frame to the skin was 0.24 ± 0.03 mGy. The average estimated absorbed dose to the prostate for all five treatment fractions across all machines measured was 39.9 ± 2.6 mGy for 1 Hz imaging, 199.7 ± 13.2 mGy for 5 Hz imaging and 439.3 ± 29.0 mGy for 11 Hz imaging.

Most data on consequences of prostate biopsy for men pertain to physical after-effects and/or come from clinical trial populations. We quantified prevalence of, and identified factors associated with, procedure-related distress in men having prostate biopsies in routine clinical practice.  Methods:   Men who had undergone prostate biopsy for follow-up of a raised prostate specific antigen test result and/or abnormal digital rectal examination in 6 centres in Ireland completed questionnaires. Biopsy-related psychological distress was measured using the Impact of Event Scale. An Impact of Event Scale score ≥ 9 was considered significant biopsy-related distress. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of significant distress.  Results:   Three hundred thirty-five men completed questionnaires. Overall, 49% had significant biopsy-related distress; this was higher in men whose biopsy result indicated cancer (59%) and those who did not have a definitive result (54%) than those with a negative result (35%; P < .001). In multivariable analyses, the odds of significant distress were 3 times higher in men with cancer (OR = 3.33, 95% CI, 1.83-6.04) and more than twice as high in men without a definitive result (OR = 2.61, 95% CI, 1.43-4.78) compared to men with a negative result. Men with intermediate (OR = 3.19, 95% CI, 1.85-5.53) or high (OR = 7.10, 95% CI, 3.45-14.57) health anxiety (propensity to worry about one's health) also had significantly increased odds of biopsy-related distress.

Stressful sequelae of radical prostatectomy are incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Hormone ablation and radiation therapy are also known stressors. Mental stress has a low prevalence compared to other tumor entities. It is highly probable that there is an underexpression of verbally reported emotional experiences. Therefore, a low-threshold access to psycho-oncological services and accurate identification of patients with mental comorbidities is important. The aim of this study was to identify the distress level with clarification of the stress in patients with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Prospective evaluation of prostate cancer patients (n = 81, mean age 69 years) with regard to stress level, stress factors and the need for care using the Distress Thermometer, a standardized ultrashort stress-screening questionnaire.  Results:   The mean stress level was 4.4 points. In total, 56% of patients indicated a stress level ≥5, i. e. a clinically relevant psychological burden was indicated. Main stressors were sexual problems (35%), reduced mobility (30%), pain (27.5%), tingling paresthesia (26%) and worries (26%).  Conclusion:   The psychological burden of prostate cancer patients is not as high as in other solid organ malignancies. However, some patients have a significantly increased psychosocial stress level.

In cancer screening, overdiagnosed cancers are those that did not need to be found because they would not have produced symptoms or led to premature death. These overdiagnosed cancers can be distinguished from false positives, which occur when an initial screening test suggests that a person is at high risk but follow-up testing shows them to be at normal risk. The cancers most likely to be overdiagnosed through screening are those of the prostate, thyroid, breast and lung. Overdiagnosis in cancer screening arises largely from the paradoxical problem that screening is most likely to find the slow-growing or dormant cancers that are least likely to harm us, and less likely to find the aggressive, fast-growing cancers that cause cancer mortality. This central paradox has become clearer over recent decades. The more overdiagnosis is produced by a screening program, the less likely the program is to serve its ultimate goal of reducing illness and premature death from cancer. Thus, it is vital that health professionals and researchers continue an open, scientific inquiry into the extent and consequences of overdiagnosis, and devise appropriate responses to it.""","""['Stacy M Carter', 'Alexandra Barratt']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Public Health Res Pract""","""['Estimating the magnitude of cancer overdiagnosis in Australia.', 'Lifetime risk of prostate cancer overdiagnosis in Australia: quantifying the risk of overdiagnosis associated with prostate cancer screening in Australia using a novel lifetime risk approach.', 'Overdiagnosis in cancer screening: the need for a standardized denominator.', 'Lung cancer screening overdiagnosis: reports of overdiagnosis in screening for lung cancer are grossly exaggerated.', 'Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer: answers to five key questions.', 'Diagnostic error, uncertainty, and overdiagnosis in melanoma.', 'Impact of early detection on cancer curability: A modified Delphi panel study.', 'A Novel Deep Learning Model to Distinguish Malignant Versus Benign Solid Lung Nodules.', 'Interventions to improve media coverage of medical research: a codesigned feasibility and acceptability study with Australian journalists.', 'Isolated headache is not a reliable indicator for brain cancer: the 2-week wait pathway for suspected CNS malignancies.']"""

Six states and jurisdictions elected to expand Medicaid early before 2012. This provided a natural experiment to test the association between expanded insurance coverage and preventive service utilization, including prostate cancer screening.  Materials and methods:   Using the 2012 and 2014 BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) surveys we identified men 40 to 64 years old who reported prostate specific antigen testing in the preceding 12 months. Sociodemographic and access to care variables were extracted. Income was stratified by the relationship to Medicaid eligibility and the federal poverty level (less than 138%, 138% to 400% and greater than 400%). The weighted prevalence of prostate specific antigen was estimated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with prostate specific antigen screening. Interaction analysis for Medicaid expansion was performed.  Results:   Among 158,103 respondents individuals in nonexpansion states had the highest incidence of prostate specific antigen screening. Nationally screening decreased between 2011 and 2013 (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.91). In only early expansion states there was a 3% absolute increase in screening among men in the less than 138% federal poverty level, which was associated with expansion status (pinteraction = 0.04). Increased screening in early expansion states was also seen in men who were 55 to 59 years old, nonHispanic African American, Hispanic, previously married, not high school graduates and current smokers.  Conclusions:   Between 2011 and 2013 there were national declines in prostate cancer screening. However, there was significant narrowing of the gap in prostate specific antigen screening between higher and low income men in Medicaid early expansion states.

Materials and methods:   Kinematic and events data were recorded for expert (100 or more cases) and novice (less than 100 cases) surgeons performing bladder mobilization, seminal vesicle dissection, anterior vesicourethral anastomosis and right pelvic lymphadenectomy. Expert/novice metrics were compared using mixed effect statistical modeling (construct validation). Expert reviewers blindly rated seminal vesicle dissection and anterior vesicourethral anastomosis using GEARS (Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills). Intraclass correlation measured inter-rater variability. Objective metrics were correlated to corresponding GEARS metrics using Spearman's test (concurrent validation).  Results:   The performance of 10 experts (mean 810 cases, range 100 to 2,000) and 10 novices (mean 35 cases, range 5 to 80) was evaluated in 100 robot-assisted radical prostatectomy cases. For construct validation the experts completed operative steps faster (p <0.001) with less instrument travel distance (p <0.01), less aggregate instrument idle time (p <0.001), shorter camera path length (p <0.001) and more frequent camera movements (p <0.03). Experts had a greater ratio of dominant-to-nondominant instrument path distance for all steps (p <0.04) except anterior vesicourethral anastomosis.

Methods and materials:   Ten prostate cancer patients underwent HDR-BT during which the sagittally assisted sagittally reconstructed (SASR) segmentation technique was completed in parallel with commercially available sagittally assisted axially reconstructed (SAAR) TRUS for comparison. The SASR technique makes use of live 2D ultrasound intraoperatively and allows needle tip updates using the final 3D image in the absence of image artifacts. These updates were repeated offline twice by two separate users. Needle end-length measurements were used to calculate insertion depth errors (IDEs) for each technique.  Results:   Images of 147 needles were analyzed. For the SASR technique, both users were confident in tip positions on the final 3D image within 3 mm for 52% of needles, so these tip positions were updated. For the remaining 48% of needles, the tip positions from the live 2D images were used. This SASR technique enabled the localization of all needles with IDEs within ±3 mm for 84% of needles and IDE range of [-6.2 mm, 5.9 mm], compared with 57% and [-8.1 mm, 7.7 mm] when using the commercially available SAAR technique.

Fucoidan is a bioactive polysaccharide extracted mainly from algae. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects of fucoidan in both cell-based assays and mouse xenograft model, as well as to clarify possible role of JAK-STAT3 pathway in the protection.  Methods:   DU-145 human prostate cancer cells were treated with 100-1000 μg/mL of fucoidan. Cell viability, proliferation, migration and tube formation were studied using MTT, EdU, Transwell and Matrigel assays, respectively. Athymic nude mice were subcutaneously injected with DU-145 cells to induce xenograft model, and treated by oral gavage with 20 mg/kg of fucoidan for 28 days. Tumor volume and weight were recorded. Vascular density in tumor tissue was determined by hemoglobin assay and endothelium biomarker analysis. Protein expression and phosphorylation of JAK and STAT3 were determined by Western blot. Activation of gene promoters was investigated by chromatin Immunoprecipitation.  Results:   Fucoidan could dose-dependently inhibit cell viability and proliferation of DU-145 cells. Besides, fucoidan also inhibited cell migration in Transwell and tube formation in Matrigel. In animal study, 28-day treatment of fucoidan significantly hindered the tumor growth and inhibited angiogenesis, with decreased hemoglobin content and reduced mRNA expression of CD31 and CD105 in tumor tissue. Furthermore, phosphorylated JAK and STAT3 in tumor tissue were both reduced after fucoidan treatment, and promoter activation of STAT3-regulated genes, such as VEGF, Bcl-xL and Cyclin D1, was also significantly reduced after treatment.

Methods:   We identified 547 patients who were treated with modern EBRT from 1997 to 2013, of whom 98% received ADT. We analyzed biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) and distant metastases-free survival (DMFS).  Results:   Median EBRT dose was 74 Gy, and median ADT duration was 8 months. At 5 years, the DMFS was 85%. On multivariate analysis, significant predictors of shorter bRFS were biopsy Gleason score (bGS) of 8 to 10, higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, shorter duration of ADT and lower radiation dose while predictors of shorter DMFS were bGS of 8 to 10, higher PSA level, and lower radiation dose. We identified an unfavorable high-risk (UHR) group of with 2-3 HR factors based on 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria and a favorable high-risk (FHR) group, with 1 HR feature. Comparing very-HR prostate cancer, UHR & FHR, 5 year bRFS rates were 58.2%, 66.2%, and 69.2%, and 5 year DMFS rates were 78.4%, 81.2%, and 88.0%.

Methods:   We determined the recovery of PSA concentrations diluting patient samples with a standard serum of known PSA concentration. Based on the frequency distribution of recoveries in a pre-study on 268 samples, samples with recoveries <80% or >120% were defined as suspect, re-tested and further characterized to identify the cause of interference.  Results:   A total of 1158 consecutive serum samples were analyzed. Four samples (0.3%) showed reproducibly disturbed recoveries of 10%, 68%, 166% and 4441%. In three samples heterophilic antibodies were identified as the probable cause, in the fourth anti-PSA-autoantibodies. The very low recovery caused by the latter interference was confirmed in serum, as well as heparin- and EDTA plasma of blood samples obtained 6 months later. Analysis by eight different immunoassays showed recoveries ranging between <10% and 80%. In a follow-up study of 212 random plasma samples we found seven samples with autoantibodies against PSA which however did not show any disturbed PSA recovery.

The extracellular part of TMEFF2 (TMEFF2-ECD) is cleaved by ADAM17 and the membrane-retained fragment is further processed by the gamma-secretase complex. TMEFF2 shedding is increased with cell crowding, a condition associated with the tumour microenvironment, which was mediated by oxidative stress signalling, requiring jun-kinase (JNK) activation. Moreover, we have identified that TMEFF2 is also a novel substrate for other proteases implicated in prostate cancer, including two ADAMs (ADAM9 and ADAM12) and the type II transmembrane serine proteinases (TTSPs) matriptase-1 and hepsin. Whereas cleavage by ADAM9 and ADAM12 generates previously identified TMEFF2-ECD, proteolytic processing by matriptase-1 and hepsin produced TMEFF2 fragments, composed of TMEFF2-ECD or FS and/or EGF-like domains as well as novel membrane retained fragments. Differential TMEFF2 processing from a single transmembrane protein may be a general mechanism to modulate transmembrane protein levels and domains, dependent on the repertoire of ADAMs or TTSPs expressed by the target cell.""","""['Katarzyna Gaweł-Bęben', 'Nazim Ali', 'Vincent Ellis', 'Gloria Velasco', 'Zaruhi Poghosyan', 'Ann Ager', 'Vera Knäuper']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Biol Int""","""['Phorbol ester-induced shedding of the prostate cancer marker transmembrane protein with epidermal growth factor and two follistatin motifs 2 is mediated by the disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17.', 'Proteolytic processing of delta-like 1 by ADAM proteases.', 'The influence of matriptase-2 on prostate cancer in vitro: a possible role for β-catenin.', 'Dysregulation of Type II Transmembrane Serine Proteases and Ligand-Dependent Activation of MET in Urological Cancers.', 'Recent progress on inhibitors of the type II transmembrane serine proteases, hepsin, matriptase and matriptase-2.', 'TMEFF2: A Transmembrane Proteoglycan with Multifaceted Actions in Cancer and Disease.', 'The Impact of Diabetes Mellitus in COVID-19: A Mechanistic Review of Molecular Interactions.']"""

To evaluate and validate NOX5 expression in human tumors, we screened a broad range of tissue microarrays (TMAs), and report substantial overexpression of NOX5 in malignant melanoma and cancers of the prostate, breast, and ovary. In human UACC-257 melanoma cells that possesses high levels of functional endogenous NOX5, overexpression of NOX5 resulted in enhanced cell growth, increased numbers of BrdU positive cells, and increased γ-H2AX levels. Additionally, NOX5-overexpressing (stable and inducible) UACC-257 cells demonstrated increased normoxic HIF-1α expression and decreased p27Kip1 expression. Similarly, increased normoxic HIF-1α expression and decreased p27Kip1 expression were observed in stable NOX5-overexpressing clones of KARPAS 299 human lymphoma cells and in the human prostate cancer cell line, PC-3. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous NOX5 in UACC-257 cells resulted in decreased cell growth, decreased HIF-1α expression, and increased p27Kip1 expression. Likewise, in an additional human melanoma cell line, WM852, and in PC-3 cells, transient knockdown of endogenous NOX5 resulted in increased p27Kip1 and decreased HIF-1α expression. Knockdown of endogenous NOX5 in UACC-257 cells resulted in decreased Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation, signaling pathways known to modulate p27Kip1 levels. In summary, our findings suggest that NOX5 expression in human UACC-257 melanoma cells could contribute to cell proliferation due, in part, to the generation of high local concentrations of extracellular ROS that modulate multiple pathways that regulate HIF-1α and networks that signal through Akt/GSK3β/p27Kip1 .""","""['Smitha Antony', 'Guojian Jiang', 'Yongzhong Wu', 'Jennifer L Meitzler', 'Hala R Makhlouf', 'Diana C Haines', 'Donna Butcher', 'Dave S Hoon', 'Jiuping Ji', 'Yiping Zhang', 'Agnes Juhasz', 'Jiamo Lu', 'Han Liu', 'Iris Dahan', 'Mariam Konate', 'Krishnendu K Roy', 'James H Doroshow']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""[]"""

However, PCa screening remains controversial due to a high rate of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. To better reconcile both objectives, more effective methods for assessing disease severity at the time of diagnosis are needed.  Methods:   The relationship between DNA-methylation and high-grade PCa was examined in a cohort of 102 prospectively enrolled men who received standard 12-core prostate biopsies. EpiScore, an algorithm that quantifies the relative DNA methylation intensities of GSTP1, RASSF1, and APC in prostate biopsy tissue, was evaluated as a method to compensate for biopsy under-sampling and improve risk stratification at the time of diagnosis.  Results:   DNA-methylation intensities of GSTP1, RASSF1, and APC were higher in biopsy cores from men diagnosed with GS ≥ 7 cancer compared to men with diagnosed GS 6 disease. This was confirmed by EpiScore, which was significantly higher for subjects with high-grade biopsies and higher NCCN risk categories (both P < 0.001). In patients diagnosed with GS ≥ 7, increased levels of DNA-methylation were present, not only in the high-grade biopsy cores, but also in other cores with no or low-grade disease (P < 0.001). By combining EpiScore with traditional clinical risk factors into a logistic regression model, the prediction of high GS reached an AUC of 0.82 (95%CI: 0.73-0.91) with EpiScore, DRE, and atypical histological findings as most important contributors.  Conclusions:   In men diagnosed with PCa, DNA-methylation profiling can detect under-sampled high-risk PCa in prostate biopsy specimens through a field effect. Predictive accuracy increased when EpiScore was combined with other clinical risk factors. These results suggest that EpiScore could aid in the detection of occult high-grade disease at the time of diagnosis, thereby improving the selection of candidates for Active Surveillance.""","""['Leander Van Neste', 'Jack Groskopf', 'William E Grizzle', 'George W Adams', 'Mark S DeGuenther', 'Peter N Kolettis', 'James E Bryant', 'Gary P Kearney', 'Michael C Kearney', 'Wim Van Criekinge', 'Sandra M Gaston']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Risk score predicts high-grade prostate cancer in DNA-methylation positive, histopathologically negative biopsies.', 'Detection of High-grade Prostate Cancer Using a Urinary Molecular Biomarker-Based Risk Score.', 'Evaluation of an Epigenetic Assay for Predicting Repeat Prostate Biopsy Outcome in African American Men.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Genomic Markers in Prostate Cancer Decision Making.', 'Biomarkers for the Detection and Risk Stratification of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Complexities of Prostate Cancer.', 'Construction of a risk prediction model using m6A RNA methylation regulators in prostate cancer: comprehensive bioinformatic analysis and histological validation.', 'Epigenetics in prostate cancer: clinical implications.', 'Malignant Evaluation and Clinical Prognostic Values of M6A RNA Methylation Regulators in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Abiraterone acetate (AA) may also undergo SLCO-mediated transport. Based on preclinical findings showing antagonism, we hypothesized that statins may compete with AA for influx via SLCO2B1 and could negatively impact drug efficacy.  Methods:   We queried two institutional clinical databases (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute [DFCI], Johns Hopkins University [JHU]) for CRPC patients treated with AA. Treatment duration was a surrogate for TTP. Associations between statin use and AA duration were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox regression modeling adjusted for known prognostic factors.  Results:   Of the 224 DFCI and 270 JHU patients included, the majority (96%) had metastatic disease. Nearly half (41% and 45%) were statin users. In the DFCI cohort, there was a trend toward longer AA duration in statin users: 14.2 versus 9.2 months (HR 0.79, 95%CI: 0.57-1.09, P = 0.14).

While commercially available kits offer purification of EVs from biofluids, such purified EV samples will also contain non-EV entities such as soluble protein and nucleic acids that could confound subsequent experimentation. Ideally, only EVs would be isolated and no soluble protein would be present in the final EV preparation.  Methods:   We compared commercially available EV isolation kits with immunoaffinity purification techniques and evaluated our final EV preparations using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and nanoscale flow cytometry (NFC). AFM is the only modality capable of detecting distinguishing soluble protein from EVs which is important for downstream proteomics approaches. NFC is the only technique capable of quantitating the proportion of target EVs to non-target EVs in the final EV preparation.  Results:   To determine enrichment of prostate derived EVs relative to non-target MPs, anti-PSMA (Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen) antibodies were used in NFC. Antibody-based immunoaffinity purification generated the highest quality of prostate derived EV preparations due to the lack of protein and RNA present in the samples. All kits produced poor purity EV preparations that failed to deplete the sample of plasma protein.  Conclusions:   While attractive due to their ease of use, EV purification kits do not provide substantial improvements in isolation of EVs from biofluids such as plasma.

Recent studies identified distinct molecular subclasses of PCa with recurrent genomic alterations. However, the associations between molecular alterations in PCa and characteristics on mpMRI are unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate recurrent molecular alterations in PCa and their associations with mpMRI features.  Methods:   Sixty-two PCa nodules >0.5 cm had a preoperative mpMRI. Nodules were evaluated for ERG rearrangement, PTEN deletion, SPINK1 overexpression, SPOP mutation and CHD1 deletion. Each PCa focus was matched to the corresponding location on mpMRI. Lesions were scored by single observer according to the PI-RADSv2 scale.  Results:   Of the 62 nodules, 22 (35.5%) were ERG positive, 6 (9.7%) had SPINK1 overexpression, 6 (9.7%) had SPOP mutations, 4 (6.5%) had CHD1 deletions and 1 (1.6%) had PTEN deletion. All of the nodules with CHD1 deletions were not visible on mpMRI (P=0.037). All of the nodules with SPINK1 overexpression were visible on mpMRI, although the association was not statistically significant (P=0.06). There were no significant associations between any molecular alteration with the severity of the PI-RADS scores (all P>0.05).  Conclusions:   This investigation represents the first description of an association between recurrent molecular alterations and the characterization of PCa nodules on mpMRI.

However, population-based studies reporting incidence costs of prostate cancer in the long term are lacking in Europe. The objectives of the study are to analyse the long-term costs and survival of prostate cancer patients treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) or conservative management (nRP).  Methods:   A retrospective claims data analysis of the National Health Insurance Found Administration of Hungary between 01.01.2002 and 31.10.2013 was carried out. Annual incidence costs related to prostate cancer and overall survival were calculated for a cohort of patients diagnosed between 2002 and 2005.  Results:   Altogether 17,642 patients were selected; 2185 (12%) of them have undergone RP. The annual incidence rate ranged between 4177 and 4736 cases. Mean age of RP and nRP patients was 59.4 (SD 5.9) and 71.0 (8.4) years, respectively. The mean survival time of the RP patients was significantly longer compared to nRP patients both in the total sample (11.2 vs. 7.4 years; p < 0.001) and in the subgroup <70 years (11.3 vs. 8.8 years; p < 0.001). At the end of the 12-year follow-up, RP patients had a higher (0.83 vs. 0.68), while nRP patients had a slightly lower (0.35 vs. 38) probability of being alive compared with the age-matched general male population. The long-term cumulative costs of the RP and nRP patients amounted to €4448 and €8616. The main driver of the cost difference was the high drug costs in the nRP group.

Biomarkers facilitate diagnosis at the earliest possible stage and better prognosis of the disease. Hence, may help to improve the overall survival rate among breast cancer patients. To find a better diagnostic/prognostic marker we evaluated human tissue kallikrein 7 (hK7) as biomarker of breast cancer. hK7 is a secreted serine protease having chymotrypsin like activity. Serum hK7 is known to have aberrant expression in ovarian and prostate cancer but has not been yet studied in breast cancer. However, the expression level of KLK7 mRNA in breast cancer tissues has been indicated as a better prognostic marker for the unfavorable prognosis of breast carcinoma.  Materials and methods:   In this study a time-resolved immunofluorometric indirect back titration ELISA (bt-ELISA) was employed for the quantification of hK7 in serum of breast cancer patients (n = 47), benign breast disease patients (n = 13) alongwith the gender and age group specific controls (n = 99).  Results:   hK7 was significantly down-regulated in the sera of female breast cancer patients (p < 0.0001; Mean 0.704 ± 0.533 μg/L) and benign breast disease patients (p = 0.0008; Mean 0.651 ± 0.584) as compared to normal controls (Mean 1.665 ± 1.174 μg/L).  Conclusions:   Down regulation of hK7 suggests the possible role of this protein in natural course of breast cancer and benign breast diseases. Study should be extended on large-scale to confirm the potential of hK7 as biomarker of breast cancer.""","""['Samina Ejaz', 'Faiz-Ul-Hassan Nasim', 'Muhammad Ashraf', 'Gulzar Ahmad']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Heliyon""","""['Unfavorable prognostic value of human kallikrein 7 quantified by ELISA in ovarian cancer cytosols.', 'Expression of the serine protease kallikrein 7 and its inhibitor antileukoprotease is decreased in prostate cancer.', 'Development of an immunofluorometric assay and quantification of human kallikrein 7 in tissue extracts and biological fluids.', 'Human tissue kallikrein gene family: applications in cancer.', 'Expanded human tissue kallikrein family--a novel panel of cancer biomarkers.', 'Analysis of expression and prognosis of KLK7 in ovarian cancer.', 'Prognostic value of kallikrein-related peptidase 7 (KLK7) mRNA expression in advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer.', 'High levels of KLK7 protein expression are related to a favorable prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patients.']"""

Although androgen-deprivation therapy is a commonly used treatment for men with prostate cancer, the adverse effects can be detrimental to patient health and quality of life. Therefore, identifying new target genes for tumor growth will enable the development of novel therapeutic intervention. TPX2 plays a critical role in chromosome segregation machinery during mitosis. Low rates of chromosome missegregation can promote tumor development, whereas higher levels might promote cell death and suppress tumorigenesis. Hence, the strategy of promoting cell death by inducing massive chromosome missegregation has been a therapeutic application for selectively eliminating highly proliferating tumor cells. RNAi was used for TPX2 protein expression knockdown, and a clonogenic assay, immunostaining, double thymidine block, image-cytometry analysis, and tumor spheroid assay were used to analyze the role of TPX2 in tumor cell growth, cell cycle progression, multinuclearity, ploidy, and tumorigenicity, respectively; finally, Western blotting was used to analyze anticancer mechanisms in TPX2 targeting. We demonstrated that targeting TPX2 reduced cell cycle regulators and chromosome segregation genes, resulting in increased cell micronucleation. Moreover, TPX2 depletion led to prostate cancer cell growth inhibition, increased apoptosis, and reduced tumorigenesis. These results confirmed the therapeutic potential of targeting TPX2 in prostate cancer treatment. Moreover, we found that TPX2 silencing led to deregulation of CDK1, cyclin B, securin, separase, and aurora A proteins; by contrast, p21 mRNA was upregulated. We also determined the molecular mechanisms for TPX2 targeting in prostate cancer cells. In conclusion, our study illustrates the power of TPX2 as a potential novel target gene for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Hung-Wei Pan', 'Hsing-Hao Su', 'Chao-Wen Hsu', 'Guan-Jin Huang', 'Tony Tong-Lin Wu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['Targeting TPX2 Suppresses the Tumorigenesis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Resulting in Arrested Mitotic Phase Progression and Increased Genomic Instability.', 'Targeting DTL induces cell cycle arrest and senescence and suppresses cell growth and colony formation through TPX2 inhibition in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Overexpression of TPX2 is associated with progression and prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'High-throughput transcriptomic and RNAi analysis identifies AIM1, ERGIC1, TMED3 and TPX2 as potential drug targets in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting TPX2 suppresses proliferation and promotes apoptosis via repression of the PI3k/AKT/P21 signaling pathway and activation of p53 pathway in breast cancer.', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influence Hub Genes Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Deep Learning-Based Multi-Omics Integration Robustly Predicts Relapse in Prostate Cancer.', 'Target Protein for Xklp2 Functions as Coactivator of Androgen Receptor and Promotes the Proliferation of Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Gene signatures predict biochemical recurrence-free survival in primary prostate cancer patients after radical therapy.', 'A Novel Ruthenium(II) Complex With Lapachol Induces G2/M Phase Arrest Through Aurora-B Kinase Down-Regulation and ROS-Mediated Apoptosis\xa0in Human Prostate Adenocarcinoma Cells.']"""

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is established in several solid malignancies as a minimally invasive tool to profile the tumor genome in real-time, but is critically underexplored in bladder cancer.Experimental Design: We applied a combination of whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing across 50 bladder cancer driver genes to plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from 51 patients with aggressive bladder cancer, including 37 with metastatic disease.Results: The majority of patients with metastasis, but only 14% of patients with localized disease, had ctDNA proportions above 2% of total cfDNA (median 16.5%, range 3.9%-72.6%). Twelve percent of estimable samples had evidence of genome hypermutation. We reveal an aggressive mutational landscape in metastatic bladder cancer with 95% of patients harboring deleterious alterations to TP53, RB1, or MDM2, and 70% harboring a mutation or disrupting rearrangement affecting chromatin modifiers such as ARID1A Targetable alterations in MAPK/ERK or PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways were robustly detected, including amplification of ERBB2 (20% of patients) and activating hotspot mutations in PIK3CA (20%), with the latter mutually exclusive to truncating mutations in TSC1 A novel FGFR3 gene fusion was identified in consecutive samples from one patient.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that ctDNA provides a practical and cost-effective snapshot of driver gene status in metastatic bladder cancer.

Here, we show that NCTD induced PCa cell apoptosis and triggered caspase activation, which was associated with mitochondria dysfunction. Mechanistic investigations suggested that NCTD modulated the Akt signaling via increased nuclear translocation and interaction with the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) promoter by FOXO4, resulting in an apoptotic effect. Moreover, miR-320d, which targets Mcl-1, was significantly upregulated after NCTD treatment. Overexpression of miR-320d by NCTD induced mitochondria dysfunction and apoptosis, which was notably attenuated with a miR-320d inhibitor. In vivo xenograft analysis revealed that NCTD significantly reduced tumor growth in mice with PC3 tumor xenografts.

Our analysis, using geographic information systems and multivariable choice modelling, found that 33·5% (n=6465) of men bypassed their nearest prostate cancer surgical centre.

Patient mobility occurred in the absence of validated measures of the quality of care, instead influenced by the adoption of robotic surgery and the reputation of individual clinicians. National policy based on patient choice and provider competition may have had a negative impact on equality of access, service capacity, and health system efficiency.

Our experience of PDR brachytherapy for bladder prostate (BP) rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is reported, with focus on compliance and dosimetric parameters.  Materials and methods:   Treatment parameters and outcome of consecutive BP RMS patients treated in our center were examined. Treatment was carried out as part of a multimodal conservative radio-surgical treatment. Four single leader plastic tubes were implanted under perioperative guidance, encompassing the prostate/bladder neck. Tubes were systematically sutured to the bladder wall. Treatment planning was based on a computed tomography and followed Paris system rules. Continuous hourly pulses of 0.42Gy were delivered, to a total dose of 60Gy.  Results:   32 patients were treated, median age 2.6years (10months-12years). Median duration of each pulse was 8.5min (3.8-17.4min). The minimal dose in the most irradiated 1cm3 of rectum was 44.7Gyα/β=3 (range: 4.1-77.3Gyα/β=3). Brachytherapy was conducted without significant compliance concern in all but two patients, 24 and 25months-old, who pulled out plastic tubes before treatment completion. Another child needed re-planning because of slight tube displacement. With median follow-up of 14.4months (15days-75months), all patients were free from any relapse after local treatment.

We aimed to compare the effect of immediate versus delayed androgen-deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life over 5 years in men enrolled in the TOAD (Timing of Androgen Deprivation) trial.  Methods:   This randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 trial done in 29 public and private cancer centres across Australia, New Zealand, and Canada compared immediate with delayed androgen-deprivation therapy in men with PSA-only relapse after definitive treatment, or de-novo non-curable disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a database-embedded, dynamically balanced algorithm to immediate androgen-deprivation therapy (immediate therapy group) or to delayed androgen-deprivation therapy (delayed therapy group). Any type of androgen-deprivation therapy was permitted, as were intermittent or continuous schedules. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality-of-life questionnaires QLQ-C30 and PR25 were completed before randomisation, every 6 months for 2 years, and annually for a further 3 years. The primary outcome of the trial, reported previously, was overall survival, with global health-related quality of life at 2 years as a secondary endpoint. Here we report prespecified secondary objectives of the quality-of-life endpoint. Analysis was by intention to treat. Statistical significance was set at p=0·0036. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12606000301561, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00110162.  Findings:   Between Sept 3, 2004, and July 13, 2012, 293 men were recruited and randomly assigned; 151 to the delayed therapy group and 142 to the immediate therapy group. There was no difference between the two groups in global health-related quality of life over 2 years from randomisation. There were no statistically significant differences in global quality of life, physical functioning, role functioning, or emotional functioning, fatigue, dyspnoea, insomnia, or feeling less masculine over the entire 5 years after randomisation. Sexual activity was lower in the immediate therapy group than in the delayed group at 6 and 12 months (at 6 months mean score 29·20 [95% CI 24·59-33·80] in the delayed group vs 10·40 [6·87-13·93] in the immediate group, difference 18·80 [95% CI 13·00-24·59], p<0·0001; at 12 months 28·63 [24·07-33·18] vs 13·76 [9·94-17·59], 14·86 [8·95-20·78], p<0·0001), with the differences exceeding the clinically significant threshold of 10 points until beyond 2 years. The immediate therapy group also had more hormone-treatment-related symptoms at 6 and 12 months (at 6 months mean score 8·48 [95% CI 6·89-10·07] in the delayed group vs 15·97 [13·92-18·02] in the immediate group, difference -7·49 [-10·06 to -4·93], p<0·0001; at 12 months 9·32 [7·59-11·05] vs 17·07 [14·75-19·39], -7·75 [-10·62 to -4·89], p<0·0001), but with differences below the threshold of clinical significance. For the individual symptoms, hot flushes were clinically significantly higher in the immediate group (adjusted proportion 0·31 for delayed therapy vs 0·55 for immediate therapy, adjusted odds ratio 2·87 [1·96-4·21], p<0·0001) over the 5-year period, as were nipple or breast symptoms (0·06 vs 0·14, 2·64 [1·61-4·34], p=0·00013).  Interpretation:   Immediate use of androgen-deprivation therapy was associated with early detriments in specific hormone-treatment-related symptoms, but with no other demonstrable effect on overall functioning or health-related quality of life. This evidence can be used to help decision making about treatment initiation for men at this disease stage.

CD44+/CD24- cells are a putative cancer stem cells subpopulation in prostate cancer. TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is an activator of apoptosis in tumor cells. However, some tumors are TRAIL-resistant. Cancer cells can be re-sensitized to TRAIL induced apoptosis by a combination of TRAIL and taxanes. The aim of this work was to analyze the enhancement of the anticancer effect of TRAIL by paclitaxel, cabazitaxel and docetaxel in the whole population of PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, but also in CD44+/CD24- prostate cancer stem cells. We examined the apoptotic effect of TRAIL and taxanes using flow cytometry and Annexin-V-PE staining. The co-treatment with taxanes and TRAIL enhanced significantly the apoptosis in CD44+/CD24- cells only in PC3 cell line but not in DU145 cells. We discovered also that taxanes can increase the expression of death receptor TRAIL-R2 in PC3 prostate cancer cells.

Results:   Feedback from our telephone surveys was consistently positive and suggests that the structured exercise intervention provides exercise confidence, motivation to exercise, and social support and promotes positive health behaviour change in the context of exercise. Individual differences arose amongst participants in their perceived utility of the intervention, with 73.3% expressing a preference for structured exercise classes and 19.5% expressing a preference for exercising independently.

Methods and materials:   Brachytherapy patient safety events reported between January 2007 and August 2016 were retrieved from the incident reporting system and reclassified using the recently developed National System for Incident Reporting in Radiation Treatment taxonomy. A multi-incident analysis was conducted to identify common themes and key learning points.  Results:   During the study period, 3095 patients received 4967 brachytherapy fractions. An additional 179 patients had MR-guided prostate biopsies without treatment as part of an interventional research program. A total of 94 brachytherapy- or biopsy-related safety events (incidents, near misses, or programmatic hazards) were identified, corresponding to a rate of 2.8% of brachytherapy patients, 1.7% of brachytherapy fractions, and 3.4% of patients undergoing MR-guided prostate biopsy. Fifty-one (54%) events were classified as actual incidents, 29 (31%) as near misses, and 14 (15%) as programmatic hazards. Two events were associated with moderate acute medical harm or dosimetric severity, and two were associated with high dosimetric severity.

The enzyme is widely suppressed in different cancers and its re-expression has tumor suppressive effects. 15-LOX-1 has been shown to inhibit neoangiogenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC); in the present study we confirm this phenomenon and describe the mechanistic basis. We show that re-expression of 15-LOX-1 in CRC cell lines resulted in decreased transcriptional activity of HIF1α and reduced the expression and secretion of VEGF in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from CRC or prostate cancer cell lines re-expressing 15-LOX-1 (15-LOX-1CM). 15-LOX-1CM treated aortic rings from 6-week old C57BL/6 mice showed significantly less vessel sprouting and more organized structure of vascular network. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) incubated with 15-LOX-1CM showed reduced motility, enhanced expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and reduced tube formation but no change in proliferation or cell-cycle distribution. HUVECs incubated with 13(S)-HODE partially phenocopied the effects of 15-LOX-1CM, i.e., showed reduced motility and enhanced expression of ICAM-1, but did not reduce tube formation, implying the importance of additional factors. Therefore, a Proteome Profiler Angiogenesis Array was carried out, which showed that Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a matrix glycoprotein known to strongly inhibit neovascularization, was expressed significantly more in HUVECs incubated with 15-LOX-1CM. TSP-1 blockage in HUVECs reduced the expression of ICAM-1 and enhanced cell motility, thereby providing a mechanism for reduced angiogenesis. The anti-angiogenic effects of 15-LOX-1 through enhanced expressions of ICAM-1 and TSP-1 are novel findings and should be explored further to develop therapeutic options.""","""['Sinem Tunçer', 'Ayşe Gökçe Keşküş', 'Melis Çolakoğlu', 'Ismail Çimen', 'Caner Yener', 'Özlen Konu', 'Sreeparna Banerjee']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Tanshinone IIA inhibits β-catenin/VEGF-mediated angiogenesis by targeting TGF-β1 in normoxic and HIF-1α\xa0in hypoxic microenvironments in human colorectal cancer.', '12/15 Lipoxygenase regulation of colorectal tumorigenesis is determined by the relative tumor levels of its metabolite 12-HETE and 13-HODE in animal models.', 'Tanshinone IIA reduces secretion of pro‑angiogenic factors and inhibits angiogenesis in human colorectal cancer.', '15-Lipoxygenase-1 as a tumor suppressor gene in colon cancer: is the verdict in?', 'Thrombospondins as anti-angiogenic therapeutic agents.', 'Exploiting the Acidic Extracellular pH: Evaluation of Streptococcus salivarius M18 Postbiotics to Target Cancer Cells.', 'Molecular Targets in Precision Chemoprevention of Colorectal Cancer: An Update from Pre-Clinical to Clinical Trials.', 'Sciadonic acid derived from pine nuts as a food component to reduce plasma triglycerides by inhibiting the rat hepatic Δ9-desaturase.', 'Emerging cellular functions of the lipid metabolizing enzyme 15-Lipoxygenase-1.']"""

The prolonged treatment with AR antagonist leads to the expression of point mutation in the ligand binding domain of the AR. This point mutation causes resistance to AR antagonist by converting them into an agonist. The T887A mutated AR was frequently expressed in androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC) patients. Through literature survey and molecular modelling, we have identified a novel AR antagonist having a bulky β-iminoenamine BF2 complex scaffold. The tested and standard ligands were screened in AR positive (LNCaP, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453), AR negative (PC3), and non-cancerous (3T3) cell lines through anti-proliferation assay. The ligand, ARA3 was the most potent molecule among all the tested ligands and was 7.6 folds selective for AR positive cell lines. The mechanism of anti-prostate cancer activity of ARA3 was confirmed by western blot, qPCR, and apoptotic assays in LNCaP (T887A positive AR) cells. Structural activity relationship was derived by correlating the in-vitro and in-silico data. Consequently, we have identified the essential functional groups that could prevent the resistance concerning mutant AR.

In this study, a series of novel 3-oxo-4-oxa-5α-androst-17β-amide derivatives have been designed and synthesized in a more simple and convenient method. Most of the synthesized compounds displayed good 5α-reductase inhibitory activities and androgen receptor binding affinities. Their anti-proliferation activities in PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines were also evaluated and the results indicated that most of the synthesized compounds exhibited potent anti-proliferative activities. It is obvious that the androgen-dependent cell line LNCaP was much more sensitive than the androgen-independent cell line PC-3. Among all the synthesized compounds, 11d and 11k displayed the best inhibition activity with 4-fold more sensitive toward LNCaP than PC-3, which was consistent with their high affinities observed in AR binding assay. Molecular modeling studies suggested that 11k could bind to AR in a manner similar to the binding of dihydrotestosterone to AR. Compared to the finasteride, 11k showed a longer plasma half-life (4h) and a better bioavailability.

The aim of the study was to externally validate the Winter nomogram and examine its performance in patients undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND), ePLND combined with SN biopsy (SNB) and sLND only. The results were compared with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and updated Briganti nomograms.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 1183 patients with localized PCa undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP) combined with pelvic lymphadenectomy and 224 patients treated with sLND and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), aiming to offer pelvic radiotherapy only in case of histologically positive SNs. In the RARP population, ePLND was applied in 956 (80.8%) patients,while 227 (19.2%) patients were offered ePLND combined with additional SNB.  Results:   The median numbers of removed nodes were 10 (interquartile range, IQR = 6-14), 15 (IQR = 10-20) and 7 (IQR = 4-10) in the ePLND, ePLND + SNB, and sLND groups, respectively. Corresponding LNI rates were 16.6%, 25.5% and 42%. Based on the AUC, the performance of the Briganti nomogram (0.756) in the ePLND group was superior to both the MSKCC (0.744) and Winter nomogram (0.746). The Winter nomogram, however, was the best predictor of LNI in both the ePLND + SNB (0.735) and sLND (0.709) populations. In the calibration analysis, all nomograms showed better accuracy in the low/intermediate risk patients, while in the high-risk population, an overestimation of the risk for LNI was observed.  Conclusion:   The SN-based updated nomogram showed better prediction in the SN population. The results were also comparable, relative to predictive tools developed with (e)PLND, suggesting a difference in sampling accuracy between SNB and non-SNB.

Sample size ranged from 9931 to 54,162; SNPs were imputed to the 1000 Genomes European panel. Our results based on cross-trait LD Score regression showed a significant positive genetic correlation between AD and five cancers combined (colon, breast, prostate, ovarian, lung; r g = 0.17, P = 0.04), and specifically with breast cancer (ER-negative and overall; r g = 0.21 and 0.18, P = 0.035 and 0.034) and lung cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and overall; r g = 0.31, 0.38 and 0.30, P = 0.029, 0.016, and 0.006). Estimating the genetic correlation in specific functional categories revealed mixed positive and negative signals, notably stronger at annotations associated with increased enhancer activity. This suggests a role of gene expression regulators in the shared genetic etiology between AD and cancer, and that some shared variants modulate disease risk concordantly while others have effects in opposite directions. Due to power issues, we did not detect cross-phenotype associations at individual SNPs. This genetic overlap is not likely driven by a handful of major loci.

The survival benefit is evident in patients with high-volume disease, but less clear in those with low-volume disease. Here, we assessed the trade-offs between toxicity and survival using a Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms of disease and Toxicity of treatment (Q-TWiST) analysis.  Patients and methods:   This analysis was performed from the data of the Genito-Urinary Oncology Group (GETUG)-AFU 15 phase III trial evaluating the benefits of docetaxel (D) combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus ADT alone in 385 mCNPC patients. Overall survival was partitioned into three periods, namely toxic phase of treatment (TOX), time before progression without toxicity (TWIST), and progression (PROG). These health states were weighted according to patients' utility to determine quality-adjusted survival times. In threshold analyses, utility for TOX and PROG were varied from 0 to 1.  Results:   A better quality-adjusted survival was found in the ADT + D arm when the utility for PROG and TOX states were ≤0.2 and ≥ 0.8, respectively. When the utility for PROG was 0.4 or more, ADT + D and ADT alone yielded similar quality-adjusted survival. When patients were stratified into high-volume versus low-volume disease, we found a significant Q-TWiST benefit in favour of the ADT + D arm only for high-volume patients when the utility for PROG was less than 0.35, while we found no benefit in low-volume disease patients, whatever the coefficients tested.  Conclusion:   Early docetaxel may provide significant quality-adjusted survival benefits for patients with mCNPC, especially those with high-volume disease, depending on the values assigned to the times spent in the toxicity phase and after PROG. The Q-TWiST methodology is a useful tool for decision-making regarding trade-offs between survival, PROG and toxicity.""","""['P Marino', 'P Sfumato', 'F Joly', 'K Fizazi', 'S Oudard', 'S Culine', 'M Habibian', 'J-M Boher', 'G Gravis']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Burden of Metastatic Castrate Naive Prostate Cancer Patients, to Identify Men More Likely to Benefit from Early Docetaxel: Further Analyses of CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 Studies.', 'Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy plus docetaxel and estramustine versus androgen deprivation therapy alone for high-risk localised prostate cancer (GETUG 12): a phase 3 randomised controlled trial.', 'Addition of Docetaxel to Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Patients with Hormone-sensitive Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Should docetaxel be standard of care for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer?

A previous study showed that DIAPH3 promoted the metastasis of prostate cancer. However, DIAPH3 expression in TNBC and its effect on TNBC development have not been reported to date. In present study, we investigated the expression and functions of DIAPH3 in TNBC. Results of immunohistochemical staining showed that DIAPH3 expression significantly decreased in breast cancer tissues, especially TNBC tissues, compared with that in paired non-tumor tissues. In addition, DIAPH3 expression was associated with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis, but not with tumor size in patients with TNBC. Further, DIAPH3 overexpression clearly suppressed the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells and decreased the expression of Ras Homolog Family Member A (RhoA), RhoA-GTP, Matrix Metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9. Thus, we predict that DIAPH3 overexpression inhibits the migration and invasion of TNBC by inhibiting RhoA-GTP expression and the results of the present study provide new insights for developing DIAPH3-targeting therapies for TNBC.""","""['Jinyan Jiang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['miR-613 inhibits cell migration and invasion by downregulating Daam1 in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Rhophilin-associated tail protein 1 promotes migration and metastasis in triple negative breast cancer via activation of RhoA.', 'Zerumbone suppresses the motility and tumorigenecity of triple negative breast cancer cells via the inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling pathway.', 'Regulatory mechanisms, functions, and clinical significance of CircRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Recent treatment progress of triple negative breast cancer.', 'Adaptive Sparse Multi-Block PLS Discriminant Analysis: An Integrative Method for Identifying Key Biomarkers from Multi-Omics Data.', 'The pan-cancer analysis identified DIAPH3 as a diagnostic biomarker of clinical cancer.', 'Diaphanous-related formin subfamily: Novel prognostic biomarkers and tumor microenvironment regulators for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.', 'DIAPH3 is a prognostic biomarker and inhibit colorectal cancer progression through maintaining EGFR degradation.', 'FMNL2 suppresses cell migration and invasion of breast cancer: a reduction of cytoplasmic p27 via RhoA/LIMK/Cofilin pathway.']"""

We aimed to investigate trends in survival and clinical presentation at diagnosis in men who eventually died from PCa.  Patients and methods:   Based on the national database, the Danish Prostate Cancer Registry, a nationwide population-based study of all 19,487 men who died from PCa in Denmark between 1995 and 2013 was conducted. Trends in median survival and trends in age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), clinical stage, and Gleason score (GS) at diagnosis were analysed.  Results:   A total of 46.9%, 16.8%, and 36.3% had metastatic (M+), locally advanced/lymph node positive (LaN+), and localised disease, respectively, at diagnosis. Only 0.15% had localised disease, GS ≤ 6 and PSA<10. Over time, the proportion of men with M+ disease at diagnosis decreased from 54.0-38.3% (p < 0.0001), whereas the proportion LaN + disease increased from 8.6-27.3% (p < 0.0001). The proportion of localised disease remained stable at 33.2-41.9%. Median survival increased 2.11 years from 1.88 (95% CI: 1.68-2.08) in 1995 to 3.99 (95% CI: 3.71-4.28) years in 2013, p < 0.0001.  Conclusions:   In a large population-based study, the results confirmed concurrent literature that the majority of men who eventually died from PCa had LaN+ or M+ disease at diagnosis. The proportion of men with M+ disease at diagnosis decreased significantly over time, parallelled by an increase in median survival. Taken together, this indicates a lead-time effect on survival, which presently, however, is not substantial enough to result in a reduced PCa-specific mortality.""","""['John Thomas Helgstrand', 'Martin Andreas Røder', 'Nina Klemann', 'Birgitte Grønkær Toft', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Ben Vainer', 'Peter Iversen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Improving the Specificity of Screening for Lethal Prostate Cancer Using Prostate-specific Antigen and a Panel of Kallikrein Markers: A Nested Case-Control Study.', 'Mortality among men with locally advanced prostate cancer managed with noncurative intent: a nationwide study in PCBaSe Sweden.', 'Long-term outcomes among noncuratively treated men according to prostate cancer risk category in a nationwide, population-based study.', 'Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'Early detection of prostate cancer: European Association of Urology recommendation.', 'Comparative efficacy of second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors for treating prostate cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Antrodia salmonea Extracts Regulate p53-AR Signaling and Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer LNCaP Cells.', 'Changes in Characteristics of Men with Lethal Prostate Cancer During the Past 25 Years: Description of Population-based Deaths.', 'Diagnostic Age, Age at Death and Stage Migration in Men Dying with or from Prostate Cancer in Denmark.', 'Abiraterone acetate and prednisolone with or without enzalutamide for high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer: a meta-analysis of primary results from two randomised controlled phase 3 trials of the STAMPEDE platform protocol.']"""

Materials and methods:   In this retrospective study, 54 patients who received 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and 99mTc-DPD-SPECT/CT within 80 days were extracted from our database. Osseous lesions were classified as benign, malignant or equivocal. Lesion, region and patient based analysis was performed with and without CT fusion. The reference standard was generated by defining a best valuable comparator (BVC) containing information from all available data.  Results:   In the patient based analysis, accuracies measured as ""area-under-the-curve"" (AUC) for 68Ga-PSMA-PET, 99mTc-SPECT, 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and 99mTc-SPECT/CT were 0.97-0.96, 0.86-0.83, 1.00 and 0.83, respectively (p<0.05) (ranges = optimistic vs. pessimistic view).

However, localization of brachytherapy seeds on MRI scans remains a major challenge for this type of workflow. In this study, we propose and validate an MR-only seed localization method and identify remaining challenges.  Methods and materials:   The localization method was based on template matching of simulations of complex-valued imaging artifacts around metal brachytherapy seeds. The method was applied to MRI scans of 25 prostate cancer patients who underwent LDR brachytherapy and for whom postimplant dosimetry was performed after 4 weeks. The seed locations found with the MR-only method were validated against the seed locations found on CT. The circumstances in which detection errors were made were classified to gain an insight in the nature of the errors.  Results:   A total of 1490 of 1557 (96%) seeds were correctly detected, while 67 false-positive errors were made. The correctly detected seed locations had a high spatial accuracy with an average error of 0.8 mm compared with CT. A majority of the false positives occurred near other seeds. Most false negatives were found in either stranded configurations without spacers or near other seeds.  Conclusions:   The low detection error rate and high localization accuracy obtained by the complex-valued template matching approach are promising for future clinical application of MR-only dosimetry. The most important remaining challenge is robustness with regard to configurations of multiple seeds in close vicinity, such as in strands of seeds without spacers. This issue could potentially be resolved by simulating specific configurations of multiple seeds or by constraining the treatment planning to avoid these configurations, which could make the proposed method competitive with CT-based seed localization.""","""['Frank Zijlstra', 'Marinus A Moerland', 'Jochem R N van der Voort van Zyp', 'Juus L Noteboom', 'Max A Viergever', 'Peter R Seevinck']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Postimplant Dosimetry of Permanent Prostate Brachytherapy: Comparison of MRI-Only and CT-MRI Fusion-Based Workflows.', 'Feasibility of an MRI-only workflow for postimplant dosimetry of low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy: Transition from phantoms to patients.', 'EM-enhanced US-based seed detection for prostate brachytherapy.', 'A review on permanent implants for prostate brachytherapy with comparison between stranded and loose seeds.', 'In vivo dosimetry: trends and prospects for brachytherapy.', 'Deformable registration of x ray and MRI for postimplant dosimetry in low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Improving fiducial and prostate capsule visualization for radiotherapy planning using MRI.']"""

Six of the subtypes feature a mixture of represented cancer types as defined by tissue or cell of origin.

Both PCA and PN were stained with monoclonal anti-PSMA antibody (clone 3E6, 1:100, M3620). Results: All intraprostatic PCA lesions on PET could be confirmed histopathologically. In PN sections (n = 31), median staining intensity was mild, median percentage of stained cells was 20% ± 14.24%, and median immunoreactive score (IRS) was 1. In PCA sections (n = 31), median IRS was 3, median staining intensity was strong, and median percentage of stained cells was 80% ± 16.46%. The mean SUVmax (±SD) of PCA (14.06 ± 15.56) was significantly higher than that of PN (2.43 ± 0.63; P < 0.001). Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analyses of the SUVmax of PCA, validated by immunohistochemical staining in 62 tissue samples, showed the best cutoff to be 3.15 (sensitivity, 97%; specificity, 90%; area under curve, 0.987). Applied to multifocal PCA, it resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 97% respectively. The mean SUVmax of PCA and PN for an IRS of less than 2 (n = 26; 2.52 ± 0.64) was significantly lower than the mean SUVmax for an IRS of 2 or more (n = 36; 12.38 ± 15.02; P < 0.001). The mean SUVmax was significantly lower in PCA samples with fewer than 50% stained cells (n = 30; 2.81 ± 2.35) than in samples with 50% or more (n = 32; 13.34 ± 15.55; P < 0.001). There was no correlation between the SUVmax of PCA and Gleason score (P = 0.54). Conclusion: This study showed that SUVmax on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT correlates significantly with PSMA expression in primary PCA, enabling the detection of PCA with a high sensitivity and specificity.""","""['Nadine Woythal', 'Ruza Arsenic', 'Carsten Kempkensteffen', 'Kurt Miller', 'Jan-Carlo Janssen', 'Kai Huang', 'Marcus R Makowski', 'Winfried Brenner', 'Vikas Prasad']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Establishment and prospective validation of an SUVmax cutoff value to discriminate clinically significant prostate cancer from benign prostate diseases in patients with suspected prostate cancer by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT: a real-world study.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in primary staging of prostate cancer: PSA and Gleason score predict the intensity of tracer accumulation in the primary tumour.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT Has a Role in Detecting Prostate Cancer Lesions in Patients with Recurrent Disease.', 'The Impact of PSMA PET/CT on Modern Prostate Cancer Management and Decision Making-The Urological Perspective.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'A prospective head-to-head comparison of 68GaGa-P16-093 and 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in patients with primary prostate cancer.', 'PSMA Expression Correlates with Improved Overall Survival and VEGF Expression in Glioblastoma.', 'Characteristics of Radiopharmaceutical Uptake in Primary Tumor and Metastatic Lesions of Prostate Carcinoma: Comparison of Oligometastatic with Multimetastatic Disease.']"""

One gene that experiences LOI is the paracrine insulin-like growth factor IGF2, which occurs commonly in human prostate tissues during aging and tumorigenesis. However, the relationship between IGF2 LOI and prostate tumorigenesis has not been established functionally. In this study, we created a mouse model with CTCF-binding site mutations at the Igf2-H19 imprint control region that abolishes CTCF insulator activity, resulting in biallelic Igf2 expression that mimics increased levels seen with aging-induced LOI. We found that Igf2 LOI increased the prevalence and severity of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a premalignant lesion. Engineering Nkx3.1 deficiency into our model increased the frequency of PIN lesions in an additive fashion. Prostates harboring LOI displayed increased MAPK signaling and epithelial proliferation. In human prostate tissue arrays, we documented a positive correlation in benign tissues of IGF2 levels with phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT levels. Overall, our results establish that Igf2 LOI is sufficient on its own to increase rates of neoplastic development in the prostate by upregulating critical cancer-associated signaling pathways.

Current small-molecule AR antagonists, such as enzalutamide, compete with androgens that bind to the steroid-binding pocket of the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD). In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), drug resistance can manifest through AR-LBD mutations that convert AR antagonists into agonists, or by expression of AR variants lacking the LBD. Such treatment resistance underscores the importance of novel ways of targeting the AR. Previously, we reported the development of a series of small molecules that were rationally designed to selectively target the AR DNA-binding domain (DBD) and, hence, to directly interfere with AR-DNA interactions. In the current work, we have confirmed that the lead AR DBD inhibitor indeed directly interacts with the AR-DBD and tested that substance across multiple clinically relevant CRPC cell lines. We have also performed a series of experiments that revealed that genome-wide chromatin binding of AR was dramatically impacted by the lead compound (although with lesser effect on AR variants). Collectively, these observations confirm the novel mechanism of antiandrogen action of the developed AR-DBD inhibitors, establishing proof of principle for targeting DBDs of nuclear receptors in endocrine cancers.

In this work, biotin conjugated p53-antibody (anti-p53) was immobilized onto a green and biocompatible nanocomposite containing poly l-cysteine (P-Cys) as conductive matrix and 3D gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as signal amplification element. Therefore, a novel nanocomposite film based on P-Cys and GNPs was exploited to develop a highly sensitive immunosensor for detection of p53 protein. Importantly, GNPs prepared by sonoelectrodeposition method which lead to compact morphology. Fully electrochemical methodology was used to prepare a new transducer on a gold surface which provided a high surface area to immobilize a high amount of the anti-p53. The surface morphology of electrode was characterized by high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX).

Background:   Marital satisfaction of patients with prostate cancer has been insufficiently studied in Asian countries as compared with Western countries.  Design:   This study used a prospective and repeated-measures design.  Methods:   Seventy Taiwanese couples in which the husband had prostate cancer completed measures at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Assessments of physical symptoms, marital satisfaction, coping behaviour and psychological distress were made. Multiple linear regression was used to analyse the data.  Results:   The marital satisfaction of patients with prostate cancer and that of their spouses were significantly correlated. At 6 months, spouses' marital satisfaction, patients' appraisal of prostate cancer as a threat and patients' serum prostate-specific antigen levels were found to be the predictors of patients' marital satisfaction. Furthermore, patients' marital satisfaction and their spouses' psychological distress were predictors of spouses' marital satisfaction. At 12 months, spouses' marital satisfaction and patients' appraisal of prostate cancer as harm were predictors of patients' marital satisfaction. Finally, spouses' marital satisfaction (at 6 months) and appraisal of prostate cancer as a threat were predictors of spouses' marital satisfaction.  Conclusions:   At 6 months post-treatment, patients' and spouses' marital satisfaction will influence each other. However, at 12 months, patients' marital satisfaction exerts an insignificant effect on spouses' marital satisfaction. Moreover, patients' serum prostate-specific antigen level or the negative appraisal of prostate cancer affects their marital satisfaction. Spouses' marital satisfaction is affected by psychological distress and their negative appraisal of prostate cancer.  Relevance to clinical practice:   The results can be used to develop interventions for prostate cancer couples.

Baseline data included age, PSA, transrectal ultrasonography, the international prostate symptom score (IPSS), and overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS). Subjective assessment of surgical outcomes was performed at 6 months postoperatively using self-administered questionnaires consisting of 'satisfaction with treatment question' (STQ), 'overall response assessment' (ORA), and 'willingness to undergo surgery question' (WSQ).  Results:   A total of 331 patients (mean age 69.6±7.0 years) were included in the analysis. Mean total prostate volume was 69.5 (±42.2) ml. Mean preoperative IPSS score was 18.5 (±7.8). The STQ showed that most patients (91.8%) were satisfied after the surgery. Only 11 (3.3%) patients responded with 'dissatisfied', and no patients replied with 'very dissatisfied'. The WSQ showed that 311 (94.0%) patients were willing to undergo the surgery again if they had to reconsider the surgical decision. The ORA showed that all patients (99.4%) experienced an improvement. When compared with satisfied patients, neutral/dissatisfied patients had lower IPSS quality of life scores (2.7 vs. 0.9, p<0.001), higher IPSS voiding symptom scores (7.0 vs. 1.4, p<0.001), and more frequent episodes of urgency urinary incontinence in OABSS (1.0 vs. 0.3, p = 0.017) at 6 months postoperatively.

Materials and methods:   We reviewed data from 123 consecutive patients who underwent cognitive targeted prostate biopsy using prostate MRI. Of these patients, the first 55 underwent prostate biopsy using multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI), and the remaining 68 underwent prostate biopsy using b-MRI. For b-MRI, we generated T2 weighted axial imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences.

We compared the prostate cancer detection rates and the proportions of clinically significant prostate cancer between the different MRI sequences.  Results:   Between the two MRI groups, there were no statistically significant differences in prostate cancer detection rate and proportions of clinically significant prostate cancer (41.8% vs. 30.9%, p=0.208 and 82.6% vs. 76.2%, p=0.598).

Initial approaches focused on the collection of multiplex prostate cancer families. However, despite more than 20 years of linkage studies, few genes have been identified that account for a significant number of hereditary prostate cancer families. Our research team studied a large number of families with linkage evidence to chromosome 17q21-22 and ultimately identified a recurrent mutation in the HOXB13 gene. The HOXB13 G84E mutation occurs on a common haplotype consistent with a founder allele and worldwide, this allele accounts for ~5% of hereditary prostate cancer families. Current research from us and others focuses on the use of whole exome sequencing to identify rare cancer-causing alleles in early-onset and/or metastatic prostate cancer cases.

We have investigated whether the knockdown of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) by siRNA could enhance the antitumor activity of DDP, and aimed to determine the underlying mechanisms. Intravenous injection of attenuated Salmonella carrying a HIF-1α siRNA-expressing plasmid was used to knockdown HIF-1α in a PC-3 xenograft model. The in vitro and in vivo effects of HIF-1α siRNA treatment and/or DPP on PCa cell proliferation, apoptosis, glycolysis, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed by examining molecular markers specific to each process. The results demonstrated that the treatment of tumor-bearing mice with attenuated Salmonella carrying the HIF-1α siRNA plasmid greatly enhanced the antitumor effects of low-dose DDP. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that knockdown of HIF-1α improved the response of PCa cells to DDP by redirecting aerobic glycolysis toward mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, leading to cell death through overproduction of ROS.

Methods:   In this nationwide cohort study, we examined the association between stress resilience in adolescence and subsequent cancer risk. We identified a cohort of 284 257 Swedish men, born 1952-1956, who underwent compulsory military enlistment examinations including measures of psychological stress resilience (median age 18 years). The resulting score was categorised as low, moderate and high stress resilience. Individuals diagnosed with cancer during the follow-up time were identified through data linkage to the Swedish Cancer Register.  Results:   Lowest stress resilience, compared with the highest, was associated with increased risks of liver (HR: 4.73, 95% CI 2.73 to 8.19) and lung (HR: 2.75, 95% CI 2.02 to 3.74) cancer after adjusting for markers of socioeconomic circumstances in childhood (p for trend <0.001 for both cancer types). Further adjustment for cognitive and physical fitness at conscription assessment had a marginal influence. In contrast, men with low stress resilience had a decreased risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer (HR: 0.65, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.76) and malignant melanoma (HR: 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.76).

We studied primary prostate tumors with MMR defects.Experimental Design: A total of 1,133 primary prostatic adenocarcinomas and 43 prostatic small cell carcinomas (NEPC) were screened by MSH2 immunohistochemistry with confirmation by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Microsatellite instability (MSI) was assessed by PCR and NGS (mSINGS).Results: Of primary adenocarcinomas and NEPC, 1.2% (14/1,176) had MSH2 loss. Overall, 8% (7/91) of adenocarcinomas with primary Gleason pattern 5 (Gleason score 9-10) had MSH2 loss compared with 0.4% (5/1,042) of tumors with any other scores (P < 0.05). Five percent (2/43) of NEPC had MSH2 loss. MSH2 was generally homogenously lost, suggesting it was an early/clonal event. NGS confirmed MSH2 loss-of-function alterations in all (12/12) samples, with biallelic inactivation in 83% (10/12) and hypermutation in 83% (10/12). Overall, 61% (8/13) and 58% (7/12) of patients had definite MSI by PCR and mSINGS, respectively. Three patients (25%) had germline mutations in MSH2 Tumors with MSH2 loss had a higher density of infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes compared with grade-matched controls without MSH2 loss (390 vs. 76 cells/mm2; P = 0.008), and CD8+ density was correlated with mutation burden among cases with MSH2 loss (r = 0.72, P = 0.005). T-cell receptor sequencing on a subset revealed a trend toward higher clonality in cases versus controls.Conclusions: Loss of MSH2 protein is correlated with MSH2 inactivation, hypermutation, and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte density, and appears most common among very high-grade primary tumors, for which routine screening may be warranted if validated in additional cohorts.

Although the prevalence of germline mutations in DNA-repair genes among men with localized prostate cancer who are unselected for family predisposition is insufficient to warrant routine testing, the frequency of such mutations in patients with metastatic prostate cancer has not been established.  Methods:   We recruited 692 men with documented metastatic prostate cancer who were unselected for family history of cancer or age at diagnosis. We isolated germline DNA and used multiplex sequencing assays to assess mutations in 20 DNA-repair genes associated with autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition syndromes.  Results:   A total of 84 germline DNA-repair gene mutations that were presumed to be deleterious were identified in 82 men (11.8%); mutations were found in 16 genes, including BRCA2 (37 men [5.3%]), ATM (11 [1.6%]), CHEK2 (10 [1.9% of 534 men with data]), BRCA1 (6 [0.9%]), RAD51D (3 [0.4%]), and PALB2 (3 [0.4%]). Mutation frequencies did not differ according to whether a family history of prostate cancer was present or according to age at diagnosis. Overall, the frequency of germline mutations in DNA-repair genes among men with metastatic prostate cancer significantly exceeded the prevalence of 4.6% among 499 men with localized prostate cancer (P<0.001), including men with high-risk disease, and the prevalence of 2.7% in the Exome Aggregation Consortium, which includes 53,105 persons without a known cancer diagnosis (P<0.001).  Conclusions:   In our multicenter study, the incidence of germline mutations in genes mediating DNA-repair processes among men with metastatic prostate cancer was 11.8%, which was significantly higher than the incidence among men with localized prostate cancer.

Abiraterone is metabolized in patients to Δ(4)-abiraterone (D4A), which has even greater antitumour activity and is structurally similar to endogenous steroidal 5α-reductase substrates, such as testosterone. Here, we show that D4A is converted to at least three 5α-reduced and three 5β-reduced metabolites in human serum. The initial 5α-reduced metabolite, 3-keto-5α-abiraterone, is present at higher concentrations than D4A in patients with prostate cancer taking abiraterone, and is an androgen receptor agonist, which promotes prostate cancer progression. In a clinical trial of abiraterone alone, followed by abiraterone plus dutasteride (a 5α-reductase inhibitor), 3-keto-5α-abiraterone and downstream metabolites were depleted by the addition of dutasteride, while D4A concentrations rose, showing that dutasteride effectively blocks production of a tumor-promoting metabolite and permits D4A accumulation. Furthermore, dutasteride did not deplete the three 5β-reduced metabolites, which were also clinically detectable, demonstrating the specific biochemical effects of pharmacological 5α-reductase inhibition on abiraterone metabolism. Our findings suggest a previously unappreciated and biochemically specific method of clinically fine-tuning abiraterone metabolism to optimize therapy.""","""['Byron H Lee']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Redirecting abiraterone metabolism to fine-tune prostate cancer anti-androgen therapy.', 'Redirecting abiraterone metabolism to fine-tune prostate cancer anti-androgen therapy.', 'Conversion of abiraterone to D4A drives anti-tumour activity in prostate cancer.', 'An LC-MS/MS method for quantification of abiraterone, its active metabolites D(4)-abiraterone (D4A) and 5α-abiraterone, and their inactive glucuronide derivatives.', 'HSD3B1 status as a biomarker of androgen deprivation resistance and implications for prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate: a novel drug for castration-resistant prostate carcinoma.', 'Chitosan Oligosaccharide Lactate Coated Hydroxyapatite Nanoparticles as a Vehicle for the Delivery of Steroid Drugs and the Targeting of Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Structure-Based Design of Inhibitors with Improved Selectivity for Steroidogenic Cytochrome P450 17A1 over Cytochrome P450 21A2.', 'Development and validation of a novel LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of abiraterone and its seven steroidal metabolites in human serum: Innovation in separation of diastereoisomers without use of a chiral column.']"""

The present study sought to evaluate the association between CRF and cancer incidence in men.  Methods:   Maximal exercise testing was performed in 4920 men (59.2 ± 11.4 years) free from malignancy at baseline who were followed for 12.7 ± 7.5 years. Relative risks and population attributable risks were determined.  Results:   During the follow-up, 25.8% were diagnosed with any type of cancer. CRF was inversely associated with total cancer incidence; for each one metabolic equivalent increase in CRF, there was a 4% reduction in cancer incidence (P < .001). Compared with low CRF, moderate and high CRF levels were associated with 14% (95% CI [0.74-0.99]) and 26% (95% CI [0.62-0.89]) reduced risks for all cancers, respectively (P for trend = .004). Low CRF had a population attributable risk of 3.0% for cancer incidence. The associations between CRF, prostate, skin and colorectal cancers were not significant.  Conclusions:   Higher CRF is associated with lower total cancer incidence in men. A novel finding suggests that eliminating low CRF as a risk factor would potentially prevent considerable cancer morbidity and reduce the societal and economic burden associated with cancer. These findings underscore the importance of CRF for primary cancer prevention.""","""['Baruch Vainshelboim', 'Jan Müller', 'Ricardo M Lima', 'Kevin T Nead', 'Cariad Chester', 'Khin Chan', 'Peter Kokkinos', 'Jonathan Myers']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Ann Epidemiol""","""['Cardiorespiratory fitness, incidence and mortality of lung cancer in men: A prospective cohort study.', 'Cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity and cancer mortality in men.', 'Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Adiposity, and Cancer Mortality in Men.', 'Cardiorespiratory fitness is not associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer: A cohort study and review of the literature.', 'Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention: an Update.', 'Sudden Cardiac Death in Athletes: Facts and Fallacies.', 'Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in the Older Athlete.', 'Early-Life Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Long-term Risk of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Association Between Polypharmacy and Physical Function in Older Adults: a Systematic Review.', 'Association of Cardiorespiratory Fitness With Long-term Mortality Among Adults Undergoing Exercise Treadmill Testing.']"""

Active surveillance was introduced to prevent overtreatment and reduce costs while preserving the option of radical prostatectomy. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of active surveillance compared to watchful waiting and radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Markov models were constructed to estimate the life-time cost-effectiveness of active surveillance compared to watchful waiting and radical prostatectomy for low risk localised prostate cancer patients aged 45-70 years, using national datasets in New Zealand and published studies including the SPCG-4 study. This study was from the perspective of the Ministry of Health in New Zealand.  Results:   Radical prostatectomy is less costly than active surveillance in men aged 45-55 years with low risk localised prostate cancer, but more costly for men aged 60-70 years. Scenario analyses demonstrated significant uncertainty as to the most cost-effective option in all age groups because of the unavailability of good quality of life data for men under active surveillance. Uncertainties around the likelihood of having radical prostatectomy when managed with active surveillance also affect the cost-effectiveness of active surveillance against radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   Active surveillance is less likely to be cost-effective compared to radical prostatectomy for younger men diagnosed with low risk localised prostate cancer. The cost-effectiveness of active surveillance compared to radical prostatectomy is critically dependent on the 'trigger' for radical prostatectomy and the quality of life in men on active surveillance.

Increasing evidence suggests that CD44Bright cells are highly cancer stem cell like, but it is not clear about their dynamic transition between CD44Dim and CD44Bright phenotypes in prostate cancer cells, and how it is affected by mitochondrial DNA depletion. To address these questions, four cell subpopulations were isolated from both DU145WT and DU145MtDP cell lines based on their CD44 expression level and mitochondrial membrane potential. The cell motility and colony formation capability of the fluorescence activated cell sorting-sorted cell subpopulations were further examined. It was discovered in the DU145WT cells that CD44Dim cells could transit into both CD44Dim and CD44Bright phenotypes and that CD44Bright cells were prone to sustain their CD44Bright phenotype as renewal. However, such transition principle was altered in the DU145MtDP cells, in which CD44Bright cells showed similar capability to sustain a CD44Bright phenotype, while the transition of CD44Dim cells to CD44Bright were suppressed. It is concluded that mitochondrial DNA depletion in the human prostate cancer DU145 cells influences their renewal and CD44 subphenotype transition.

Further optimization of the tumor-to-background contrast might significantly enhance the sensitivity of PET/CT imaging and the probability of detecting recurrent prostate cancer at low PSA values. This study describes the advantage of histidine (H)/glutamic acid (E) and tryptophan (W)/glutamic acid (E) containing linkers on the pharmacokinetic properties of 68Ga-PSMA-11. The tracers were obtained by a combination of standard Fmoc-based solid-phase synthesis and copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Their 68Ga complexes were compared to the clinical reference 68Ga-PSMA-11 with respect to cell binding, effective internalization, and tumor targeting properties in LNCaP-bearing balb/c nu/nu mice. The introduction of (HE)i (i = 1-3) or (WE)i (i = 1-3) into PSMA-11 resulted in a significantly changed biodistribution profile. The uptake values in kidneys, spleen, liver, and other background organs were reduced for (HE)3 while the tumor uptake was not affected. For (HE)1 the tumor uptake was significantly increased.

A rectal displacement device (RDD) reduces rectal dose in prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). This study investigates any dosimetric difference between two methods of rectal displacement (Rectafix and SpaceOAR) for prostate SBRT.  Methods:   Rectal dosimetry of 45 men who received SBRT within the PROMETHEUS trial was retrospectively examined, across two radiation therapy centres using the two RDD's. Men received a total dose (TD) of 19 or 20 Gy in two fractions followed by 46 Gy in 23 fractions. Centre 1 contributed 16 Rectafix and 10 SpaceOAR patients. Centre 2 contributed 19 Rectafix patients. Rectal dose volume histogram (DVH) data were recorded as a TD percentage at the following volume intervals; V1%, V2%, V5%, V10% and then 10% increments to V80%. As only one centre employed both RDD's, three sequential rectal dosimetry comparisons were performed; (1) centre 1 Rectafix versus centre 1 SpaceOAR; (2) centre 1 Rectafix versus centre 2 Rectafix and (3) centre 1+ centre 2 Rectafix versus centre 1 SpaceOAR.  Results:   In comparison (1) Rectafix demonstrated lower mean doses at 9 out of 11 measured intervals (P = 0.0012). Comparison (2) demonstrated a moderate difference with centre 2 plans producing slightly lower rectal doses (P = 0.013). Comparison (3) further demonstrated that Rectafix returned lower mean doses than SpaceOAR (P < 0.001). Although all dose levels were in favour of Rectafix, in absolute terms differences were small (2.6-9.0%).  Conclusions:   In well-selected prostate SBRT patients, Rectafix and SpaceOAR RDD's provide approximately equivalent rectal sparing.""","""['Lee Wilton', 'Matthew Richardson', 'Sarah Keats', 'Kimberley Legge', 'Mary-Claire Hanlon', 'Sankar Arumugam', 'Perry Hunter', 'Tiffany-Jane Evans', 'Mark Sidhom', 'Jarad Martin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Med Radiat Sci""","""['Improved rectal dosimetry with the use of SpaceOAR during high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Real-time in vivo rectal wall dosimetry using MOSkin detectors during linac based stereotactic radiotherapy with rectal displacement.', 'SpaceOAR hydrogel spacer injection prior to stereotactic body radiation therapy for men with localized prostate cancer: A systematic review.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Absorbable Hydrogel Spacer Use in Prostate Radiotherapy: A Comprehensive Review of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Published Data.', 'Virtual HDR Boost for Prostate Cancer: Rebooting a Classic Treatment Using Modern Tech.', 'Rectal retractor in prostate radiotherapy: pros and cons.', 'TROG 18.01 phase III randomised clinical trial of the Novel Integration of New prostate radiation schedules with adJuvant Androgen deprivation: NINJA study protocol.', 'Decision Support Systems in Prostate Cancer Treatment: An Overview.', 'Phase 2 Multicenter Study of Gantry-Based Stereotactic Radiotherapy Boost for Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer (PROMETHEUS).']"""

This technique is commonly used to identify factors, which allowed these adverse events to occur, to target areas for improvement and to improve health care delivery systems. We sought to apply this technique to men presenting with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   We performed an in-depth case series analysis of 15 patients, who presented with metastatic disease at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center using root cause analysis to refine a list of health system factors that lead to late stage presentation in the current era.  Results:   Key factors in late diagnosis of PCa included lack of insurance, lack of routine PSA testing, comorbidities, reticence of patients to follow up actionable PSA, and aggressive disease. Three patients had aggressive disease that would not have been discovered at an early stage in the disease process, despite routine screening. However, analysis of the remaining 12 patients illuminated health system factors led to missing important diagnostic information, which might have led to diagnosis of PCa at a curable stage.  Conclusions:   The cases help highlight the need for systems based approaches to early diagnosis of PCa. A heterogeneous group of barriers to early diagnosis were identified in our series of patients including economic, health systems, and cultural factors. These findings underscore the need for individualized approaches to preventing delayed diagnosis of PCa. While limited by our single-institution scope, this approach provides a model for research and quality improvement initiatives to identify modifiable systems factors impeding appropriate diagnoses of PCa.""","""['Channing J Paller', 'Alexander P Cole', 'Alan W Partin', 'Michael A Carducci', 'Norma F Kanarek']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A Calculator for Prostate Cancer Risk 4 Years After an Initially Negative Screen: Findings from ERSPC Rotterdam.', 'Histological inflammation and risk of subsequent prostate cancer among men with initially elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Improving Clinical Risk Stratification at Diagnosis in Primary Prostate Cancer: A Prognostic Modelling Study.', 'Prostate-specific antigen screening, why have the guidelines changed?', 'Prognostic value of serum markers for prostate cancer.', 'Evolving Intersection Between Inherited Cancer Genetics and Therapeutic Clinical Trials in Prostate Cancer: A White Paper From the Germline Genetics Working Group of the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium.']"""

Methods:   Based on Spanish Register of PCa, the incidence of high-risk PCa is 29%, approximately. In spite of the evidence-based beneficial effect of radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy in high-risk PCa, these patients (pts) are still a therapeutic challenge for all specialists involved, in part due to the absence of comparative studies to establish which of the present disposable treatments offer better results.  Results:   Nowadays, high-risk PCa definition is not well consensual through the published oncology guides. Clinical stage, tumour grade, and number of risk factors are relevant to be considered on PCa prognosis. However, these factors are susceptible to change depending on when surgical or radiation therapy is considered to be the treatment of choice. Other factors, such as reference pathologist, different diagnosis biopsy schedules, surgical or radiotherapy techniques, adjuvant treatments, biochemical failures, and follow-up, make it difficult to compare the results between different therapeutic options.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 34 plans generated on the Pinnacle3 version 9.4 and 9.8 treatment planning system to deliver 78 Gy in 39 fractions to the prostate only using VMAT. Data were collected on contoured structure volumes, overlaps and expansions, planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk volumes and relationship, dose volume histogram, plan conformity, plan homogeneity, low-dose wash, and beam parameters. Standard descriptive statistics were used to describe the data. Despite a standardized planning protocol, we found variability was present in all steps of the planning process. Deviations from protocol contours by radiation oncologists and radiation therapists occurred in 12% and 50% of cases, respectively, and the number of optimization parameters ranged from 12 to 27 (median 17). This contributed to conflicts within the optimization process reflected by the mean composite objective value of 0.07 (range 0.01 to 0.44). Methods used to control low-intermediate dose wash were inconsistent. At the PTV rectum interface, the dose-gradient distance from the 74.1 Gy to 40 Gy isodose ranged from 0.6 cm to 2.0 cm (median 1.0 cm). Increasing collimator angle was associated with a decrease in monitor units and a single full 6 MV arc was sufficient for the majority of plans. A significant relationship was found between clinical target volume-rectum distance and rectal tolerances achieved. A linear relationship was determined between the PTV volume and volume of 40 Gy isodose. Objective values and composite objective values were useful in determining plan quality. Anatomic geometry and overlap of structures has a measurable impact on the plan quality achieved for prostate patients being treated with VMAT. By evaluating multiple planning variables, we have been able to determine important factors influencing plan quality and develop predictive models for quality metrics that have been incorporated into our new protocol and will be tested and refined in future studies.""","""['Katrina Wright', 'Janet Ferrari-Anderson', 'Tamara Barry', 'Anne Bernard', 'Elizabeth Brown', 'Margot Lehman', 'David Pryor']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Variations in dosimetric distribution and plan complexity with collimator angles in hypofractionated volumetric arc radiotherapy for treating prostate cancer.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy: planning and evaluation for prostate cancer cases.', 'Treatment planning for radiotherapy with very high-energy electron beams and comparison of VHEE and VMAT plans.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.', 'Advances in Automated Treatment Planning.', 'A novel knowledge-based prediction model for estimating an initial equivalent uniform dose in semi-auto-planning for cervical cancer.', 'Dose Prediction Models Based on Geometric and Plan Optimization Parameter for Adjuvant Radiotherapy Planning Design in Cervical Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'A UK wide study of current prostate planning practice.', 'Can automated treatment plans gain traction in the clinic?']"""

This study investigated whether total glucosides of paeony (TGP), the active constituents extracted from the root of Paeonia Lactiflora Pall, suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated proliferation, migration and invasion in androgen insensitive prostate cancer cells. PC-3 cells were incubated with LPS (2.0 μg/mL) in the absence or presence of TGP (312.5 μg /mL). As expected, cells at S phase and nuclear CyclinD1, the markers of cell proliferation, were increased in LPS-stimulated PC-3 cells. Migration activity, as determined by wound-healing assay and transwell migration assay, and invasion activity, as determined by transwell invasion assay, were elevated in LPS-stimulated PC-3 cells. Interestingly, TGP suppressed LPS-stimulated PC-3 cells proliferation. Moreover, TGP inhibited LPS-stimulated migration and invasion of PC-3 cells. Additional experiment showed that TGP inhibited activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/p38 in LPS-stimulated PC-3 cells.

Different fusion approaches with transrectal ultrasound images are employed. To determine detection rate of prostate cancer in men undergoing transperineal MRIbased cognitive fusion biopsy.  Materials and methods:   One hundred and sixty-four consecutive men underwent a multiple-core prostate transperineal biopsy. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to address the relationship between clinical parameters and prostate cancer detection rate.  Results:   One hundred and fourteen patients underwent mpMRI prior to the transperineal biopsy, 52 (45%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, of them, 36 had Gleason score ≥7 (69%). Among these 114 patients, 82 had suspicious lesions on MRI, and 43 of them were diagnosed with cancer (52%). On multivariate analysis, the most significant independent predictive factors were PSA density (P<0.001) and suspicious MRI lesion (P=0.006). Men with a PSA density of more than 0.22 and a suspicious lesion on MRI had a detection rate of 78%. Detection rate among 50 patients with no MRI study prior to this biopsy was 26%.

This difference is mediated by ERG co-option of HOXB13 and FOXA1, implementing a T2E-specific transcriptional profile. We also report a T2E-specific CORE on the structurally rearranged ERG locus arising from spreading of the TMPRSS2 locus pre-existing CORE, assisting in its overexpression. Finally, we show that the T2E-specific cis-regulatory landscape underlies a vulnerability against the NOTCH pathway. Indeed, NOTCH pathway inhibition antagonizes the growth and invasion of T2E-positive prostate cancer cells.

Finally, we demonstrate that the treatment of PC-3 prostate tumor xenografts with oral DMAPT in addition to radiation therapy significantly decreases tumor growth and results in significantly smaller tumor volumes compared to xenografts treated with either DMAPT or radiation therapy alone, suggesting that DMAPT might have a potential clinical role as a radiosensitizing agent in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Marc S Mendonca', 'William T Turchan', 'Melanie E Alpuche', 'Christopher N Watson', 'Neil C Estabrook', 'Helen Chin-Sinex', 'Jeremy B Shapiro', 'Imade E Imasuen-Williams', 'Gabriel Rangel', 'David P Gilley', 'Nazmul Huda', 'Peter A Crooks', 'Ronald H Shapiro']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Inhibition of NF-κB and DNA double-strand break repair by DMAPT sensitizes non-small-cell lung cancers to X-rays.', 'Suppression of NF-kappaB activity by parthenolide induces X-ray sensitivity through inhibition of split-dose repair in TP53 null prostate cancer cells.', 'NF-κB-dependent and -independent epigenetic modulation using the novel anti-cancer agent DMAPT.', 'Targeted radiosensitization in prostate cancer.', 'Elucidating the role of nutraceuticals in overexpressing antiapoptotic proteins in prostate cancer.', 'Genomic Loss and Epigenetic Silencing of the FOSL1 Tumor Suppressor Gene in Radiation-induced Neoplastic Transformation of Human CGL1 Cells Alters the Tumorigenic Phenotype In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'The therapeutic effect and mechanism of parthenolide in skeletal disease, cancers, and cytokine storm.', 'Biosynthesis of anticancer phytochemical compounds and their chemistry.', 'The NF-κB Pharmacopeia: Novel Strategies to Subdue an Intractable Target.', 'Dimethylaminomicheliolide Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Radiotherapy for Synergistic Combination with Immune Checkpoint Blockade.']"""

Methods:   Golgi targeting of glycosyltransferases was characterized by confocal microscopy after knockdown of GM130, giantin, or both. N-glycans on a trans-Golgi enzyme β4galactosyltransferase-1 isolated by immunoprecipitation from androgen-sensitive and independent prostate cancer cells were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight-mass spectrometry. In situ proximity ligation assay was employed to determine co-localization of (a) α-mannosidase IA, an enzyme required for processing Man8GlcNAc2 down to Man5GlcNAc2 to enable synthesis of complex-type N-glycans, with giantin, GM130, and GRASP65, and (b) trans-Golgi glycosyltransferases with high mannose N-glycans terminated with α3-mannose.  Results:   Defective giantin in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells results in a shift of Golgi targeting of glycosyltransferases and α-mannosidase IA from giantin to GM130-GRASP65. Consequently, trans-Golgi enzymes and cell surface glycoproteins acquire high mannose N-glycans, which are absent in cells with functional giantin. In situ proximity ligation assays of co-localization of α-mannosidase IA with GM130 and GRASP65, and trans-Golgi glycosyltransferases with high mannose N-glycans are negative in androgen-sensitive LNCaP C-33 cells but positive in androgen-independent LNCaP C-81 and DU145 cells, and LNCaP C-33 cells devoid of giantin.  Conclusion:   In situ proximity ligation assays of Golgi localization of α-mannosidase IA at giantin versus GM130-GRASP65 site, and absence or presence of N-glycans terminated with α3-mannose on trans-Golgi glycosyltransferases may be useful for distinguishing indolent from aggressive prostate cancer cells.""","""['Ganapati Bhat', 'Vishwanath-Reddy Hothpet', 'Ming-Fong Lin', 'Pi-Wan Cheng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj""","""['Markers of malignant prostate cancer cells: Golgi localization of α-mannosidase 1A at GM130-GRASP65 site and appearance of high mannose N-glycans on cell surface.', 'Restoration of compact Golgi morphology in advanced prostate cancer enhances susceptibility to galectin-1-induced apoptosis by modifying mucin O-glycan synthesis.', 'Alpha-mannosidases involved in N-glycan processing show cell specificity and distinct subcompartmentalization within the Golgi apparatus of cells in the testis and epididymis.', 'Unlocking Golgi: Why Does Morphology Matter?', 'Emerging new roles of GM130, a cis-Golgi matrix protein, in higher order cell functions.', 'A distinct Golgi-targeting mechanism of dGM130 in Drosophila neurons.', 'The Role of GM130 in Nervous System Diseases.', 'Associations Between Genetically Predicted Plasma N-Glycans and Prostate Cancer Risk: Analysis of Over 140,000 European Descendants.', 'Overexpression of glycosyltransferase 8 domain containing 2 confers ovarian cancer to CDDP resistance by activating FGFR/PI3K signalling axis.', 'Compartmentalized Proteomic Profiling Outlines the Crucial Role of the Classical Secretory Pathway during Recombinant Protein Production in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells.']"""

Objective:   The purpose of the present study was to investigate clinical significance, biological functions and underlying mechanisms of ARRDC3 deregulation in PCa.  Method:   Involvement of ARRDC3 deregulation in malignant phenotypes of PCa was demonstrated by clinical sample evaluation, microarray analysis, and in vitro and in vivo experiments. The mechanisms underlying its regulatory effect on tumor progression were determined.  Results:   Microarray analysis found that ARRDC3 low expression was significantly associated with high Gleason score in TMA, and the expression level of ARRDC3 was negatively correlated with Gleason score, metastasis and biochemical recurrence in online Taylor Dataset. As revealed by the dataset, Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that the biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCR-free) time of PCa patients with ARRDC3 high expression was longer than those with ARRDC3 low expression. Additionally, both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the downregulation of ARRDC3 was an independent prognostic marker for BCR-free survival of patients with PCa. In vitro studies revealed that ARRDC3 could inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cell lines. In vivo studies proved that ARRDC3 over-expressing cells formed significantly larger tumor nodules and remarkably speeded up tumor xenografts growth compared with the controls. Moreover, immunohistochemical scores of Ki67 and MMP-9 were significantly lower than those of the control group.

In recent years, EPA and DHA have been found to affect cancer cell proliferation. In the present study, PC3 cells, which are androgen-independent prostate cancer cells that resemble castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, were used to investigate a possible novel treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer. The PC3 cells were cultured and incubated with various concentrations of EPA or DHA. Cancer proliferation was confirmed by trypan blue microscopy. Invasion and migration assays were used in the upper chamber in PC3 cells, and serum-free medium and various concentrations of EPA or DHA were placed in the lower chamber in serum-containing medium. EPA and DHA decreased PC3 cell proliferation, invasion and migration. The effect of EPA on PC3 cells was dose-dependent and significant differences were observed at concentrations of 100 and 200 µg/ml. The effect of DHA on PC3 cells was similar to that of EPA. In the migration assay, EPA exerted almost no effects at 25 µg/ml, but migration was reduced at 50 µg/ml. Similar to EPA, DHA exerted almost no effects at 25 µg/ml, but further reduction was observed at the 50 µg/ml concentration. In the invasion assay, EPA at 25 µg/ml was not significantly different from the control, but suppressed invasion at 50 µg/ml. DHA decreased invasion compared with the control at 25 µg/ml, whereas invasion was significantly reduced at a DHA concentration of 50 µg/ml. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that EPA and DHA were effective in decreasing the proliferation, invasion and migration of prostate PC3 cancer cells.

GSP treatment also resulted in induction of apoptosis and autophagy via generation of reactive oxygen species. The inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine decreased GSP-induced cell death, which suggested that GSP-induced autophagy can promote cell death.

Methods:   Separate models were created for men undergoing initial and repeat biopsy, identified from our institutional biopsy database and the placebo arm of the REDUCE trial, respectively, to predict the presence of CSPC (Gleason≥7 or>33% of cores involved). Predictors considered included age, race, body mass index, family history of prostate cancer, digital rectal examination, prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free-to-total PSA, presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical small acinar proliferation on prior biopsy, number of prior biopsies, and number of cores previously taken. Multivariable logistic regression models that minimized the Akaike Information Criterion and maximized out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) were selected.  Results:   Of 7,963 biopsies (initial = 2,042; repeat = 5,921), 1,138 had CSPC (initial = 870 [42.6%]; repeat = 268 [4.5%]).

Prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC-3), normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC), and patient-derived prostate tumor explants were treated with MET and/or VPA. Proliferation and apoptosis were assessed. The role of p53 in response to MET + VPA was assessed in cell lines using RNAi in LNCaP (p53+) and ectopic expression of p53 in PC-3 (p53-). The role of the androgen receptor (AR) was investigated using the AR antagonist enzalutamide. The combination of MET and VPA synergistically inhibited proliferation in LNCaP and PC-3, with no significant effect in PrEC. LNCaP, but not PC-3, demonstrated synergistic intrinsic apoptosis in response to MET + VPA. Knockdown of p53 in LNCaP (p53+, AR+) reduced the synergistic apoptotic response as did inhibition of AR. Ectopic expression of p53 in PC-3 (p53-, AR-) increased apoptosis in response to MET + VPA. In patient-derived prostate tumor explants, MET + VPA also induced a significant decrease in proliferation and an increase in apoptosis in tumor cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that MET + VPA can synergistically kill more prostate cancer cells than either drug alone. The response is dependent on the presence of p53 and AR signaling, which have critical roles in prostate carcinogenesis. Further in vivo/ex vivo preclinical studies are required to determine the relative efficacy of MET + VPA as a potential treatment for prostate cancer.

However, the efficacy of molecular targeted drugs such as inhibitory antibodies or small molecule inhibitors essentially depends on target expression and activity, which both can change during the course of treatment. Radiotherapy has previously been shown to activate prosurvival pathways, which can help tumor cells to adapt and thereby survive treatment. Therefore, we aimed to identify changes in signaling induced by radiation and evaluate the potential of targeting these changes with small molecules to increase the therapeutic efficacy on cancer cell survival. Analysis of ""The Cancer Genome Atlas"" database disclosed a significant overexpression of AKT1, AKT2, and MTOR genes in human prostate cancer samples compared with normal prostate gland tissue. Multifractionated radiation of three-dimensional-cultured prostate cancer cell lines with a dose of 2 Gy/day as a clinically relevant schedule resulted in an increased protein phosphorylation and enhanced protein-protein interaction between AKT and mTOR, whereas gene expression of AKT, MTOR, and related kinases was not altered by radiation. Similar results were found in a xenograft model of prostate cancer. Pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR/AKT signaling after activation by multifractionated radiation was more effective than treatment prior to radiotherapy. Taken together, our findings provide a proof-of-concept that targeting signaling molecules after activation by radiotherapy may be a novel and promising treatment strategy for cancers treated with multifractionated radiation regimens such as prostate cancer to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to molecular targeted drugs.

To evaluate the current situation in Belgium, optimal utilisation proportions (OUPs) adopted from the European SocieTy for Radiotherapy and Oncology - Health Economics in Radiation Oncology (ESTRO-HERO) project were compared to actual utilisation proportions (AUPs) and with radiotherapy advised during the multidisciplinary cancer team (MDT) meetings. In addition, the impact of independent variables was analysed.  Materials and methods:   AUPs and advised radiotherapy were calculated overall and by cancer type for 110,810 unique cancer diagnoses in 2009-2010. Radiotherapy utilisation was derived from reimbursement data and distinguished between palliative and curative intent external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and/or brachytherapy (BT). Sensitivity analyses regarding the influence of the follow-up period, the survival length and patient's age were performed. Advised radiotherapy was calculated based on broad treatment categories as reported at MDT meetings.  Results:   The overall AUP of 37% (39% including BT) was lower than the OUP of 53%, but in line with advised radiotherapy (35%). Large variations by tumour type were observed: in some tumours (e.g. lung and prostate cancer) AUP was considerably lower than OUP, whereas in others there was reasonable concordance (e.g. breast and rectal cancer). Overall, 84% of treatments started within 9 months following diagnosis. Survival time influenced AUP in a cancer type-dependent way. Elderly patients received less radiotherapy.  Conclusion:   Although the actually delivered radiotherapy in Belgium aligns well to MDT advices, it is lower than the evidence-based optimum.

The remaining associations (p < 0.0025) included thyroid, endometrial, testicular, eye cancers (uveal melanoma), nervous system and endocrine tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The RR for BC increased by increasing numbers of patients with any cancer in family members and it reached 1.62 when three or more family members were affected.

However, clinical studies have shown that the kidneys are one of the off-target organs along with the salivary and lacrimal glands. In the kidneys, PSMA is physiologically expressed in the apical epithelium of the proximal tubules, and mannitol acts as an osmotic diuretic in these tubules. We investigated the potential of mannitol to reduce renal uptake of 68Ga-PSMA.  Methods:   Kidney uptake (SUVmax) was calculated in nine patients undergoing 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT at baseline (b-PET/CT) and after intravenous infusion of 500 ml of 10% mannitol (m-PET/CT). Two different infusion schemes for mannitol were used: (1) 500 ml mannitol was infused over 40 min after 68Ga-PSMA administration (A-infusion) and (2) 250 ml mannitol was infused over 15 min before and again after 68Ga-PSMA administration (B-infusion).  Results:   In patients receiving the A-infusion, mean SUVmax increased by 11.9% and 7.4% in the right and left kidney, respectively. In patients receiving the B-infusion, mean SUVmax decreased by 24.3% and 22.4% in the right and left kidney, respectively.  Conclusion:   Our preliminary findings indicate that mannitol may play a role in reducing off-target 68Ga-PSMA renal uptake. Administration of the osmotic diuretic should be rapid and start before 68Ga-PSMA injection. These results warrant dosimetric studies in patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA to find the best scheme for mannitol administration.""","""['Federica Matteucci', 'Emilio Mezzenga', 'Paola Caroli', 'Valentina Di Iorio', 'Anna Sarnelli', 'Monica Celli', 'Lorenzo Fantini', 'Andrea Moretti', 'Riccardo Galassi', 'Ugo De Giorgi', 'Giovanni Paganelli']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'SUV95th as a Reliable Alternative to SUVmax for Determining Renal Uptake in 68Ga PSMA PET/CT.', 'Evaluation of Practical Interpretation Hurdles in 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in 55 Patients: Physiological Tracer Distribution and Incidental Tracer Uptake.', 'The Theranostic PSMA Ligand PSMA-617 in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer by PET/CT: Biodistribution in Humans, Radiation Dosimetry, and First Evaluation of Tumor Lesions.', 'Quantitative Test-Retest Measurement of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC in Tumor and Normal Tissue.', 'Optimizing the Safety and Efficacy of Bio-Radiopharmaceuticals for Cancer Therapy.', 'Kidney Protection with the Radical Scavenger α1-Microglobulin (A1M) during Peptide Receptor Radionuclide and Radioligand Therapy.', 'Flare phenomenon in prostate cancer: recent evidence on new drugs and next generation imaging.', 'The increasing potential of nuclear medicine imaging for the evaluation and reduction of normal tissue toxicity from radiation treatments.', '177Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy in Mice, with or without the Antioxidant α1-Microglobulin (A1M), Including Kidney Damage Assessment Using 99mTc-MAG3 Imaging.']"""

Subjects/patients and methods:   Consecutive patients referred to our institution with raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA), abnormal prostate examination, or persistent suspicion of prostate cancer after previous transrectal biopsy between July 2012 and November 2015 were reviewed from a prospective database. All patients underwent prebiopsy B-MRI with T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences, followed by 24 to 40 core TPSB with additional targeted cores using cognitive registration. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of prostate cancer outcomes. Multivariable coefficients were used to construct 2 MRI-based nomograms to predict any and significant (Gleason 4 or maximum cancer core length ≥6mm) prostate cancer at TPSB. Bootstrap resamples were used for internal validation. Accuracy was assessed by calculating the concordance index.  Results:   In total, 615 men were included in the study. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 317 (51.5%) men with significant cancer diagnosed in 237 (38.5%) men. Age, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score, PSA, PSA density, and primary biopsy were predictors of prostate cancer at TPSB on univariable analysis (P<0.0001). PSA showed strong correlation with PSA density and was excluded. The remaining variables were all independent predictors of prostate cancer on multivariable analysis (P<0.0001) and used to generate the nomograms. Both nomograms showed good discrimination for prostate cancer, with a concordance index of 87% for any cancer and 92% for significant disease. Using a nomogram-derived probability threshold of<15%, 111 (18.0%) biopsies can be saved, at the expense of 3 missed significant prostate cancers.  Conclusions:   These internally validated MR-based nomograms were able to accurately predict TPSB outcomes for prostate cancer, especially significant disease.

As the molecular mechanism of PCa has not yet been completely discovered, identification of hub genes and potential drug of this disease is an important area of research that could provide new insights into exploring the mechanisms underlying PCa.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to identify potential biomarkers and novel drug for prostate cancer treatment.  Methods:   The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between prostate cancer and normal cells were screened using microarray data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were performed in order to investigate the functions of DEGs, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed using the Cytoscape software. DEGs were then mapped to the connectivity map database to identify molecular agents associated with the underlying mechanisms of PCa.  Results:   Totally, 359 genes (155 upregulated and 204 downregulated genes) were found to be differentially expressed between prostate cancer and normal cells. The GO terms significantly enriched by DEGs included cell adhesion, protein binding involved in cell-cell adhesion, response to BMP, extracellular region and extracellular region part. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the most significant pathways included cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and TGF-beta signaling pathway. The PPI network of up-regulated DEGs and down-regulated DEGs were established, respectively. While CDH1, BMP2, NKX3-1, PPARG and PRKAR2B were identified as the hub genes in the PPI network.  Conclusions:   The BMP2, PPARG and PRKAR2B genes may therefore be potential biomarkers in the treatment of PCa. Additionally, the small molecular agent phenoxybenzamine may be a potential drug for PCa.""","""['Enhao Fang', 'Xiuqing Zhang', 'Qi Wang', 'Daoming Wang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Biomark""","""['Identification of breast cancer hub genes and analysis of prognostic values using integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Identiﬁcation of candidate biomarkers and pathways associated with SCLC by bioinformatics analysis.', 'Bioinformatics analyses of significant genes, related pathways and candidate prognostic biomarkers in glioblastoma.', 'MicroRNAs and the Response of Prostate Cancer to Anti-Cancer Drugs.', 'CRISPR Screen Contributes to Novel Target Discovery in Prostate Cancer.', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influence Hub Genes Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Screening a novel six critical gene-based system of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in prostate adenocarcinoma patients with different clinical variables.', 'Based on network pharmacology and molecular docking to predict the mechanism of Huangqi in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Environmental Phenol and Paraben Exposure Risks and Their Potential Influence on the Gene Expression Involved in the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'GPCRs Are Optimal Regulators of Complex Biological Systems and Orchestrate the Interface between Health and Disease.']"""

Since obesity is linked with several chronic health conditions, understanding which types of shift work influence obesity is important and additional work with more detailed exposure assessment of shift work is warranted.  Methods:   Using multivariate polytomous logistic regression, we investigated the associations between shift work (evening/night, rotating and other shift schedules) and overweight and obesity as measured by body mass index cross-sectionally among 1561 men. These men had previously participated as population controls in a prostate cancer case-control study conducted in northeastern Ontario from 1995 to 1999. We obtained information on work history (including shift work), height and weight from the existing self-reported questionnaire data.  Results:   We observed an association for ever (vs. never) having been employed in rotating shift work for both the overweight (OR [odds ratio] = 1.34; 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.05-1.73) and obese (OR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.12-2.21) groups. We also observed nonsignificant associations for ever (vs. never) having been employed in permanent evening/night shifts. In addition, we found a significant trend of increased risk for both overweight and obesity with increasing duration of rotating shift work.  Conclusion:   Both the positive association between rotating shift work and obesity and the suggested positive association for permanent evening/night shift work in this study are consistent with previous findings. Future population-based research that is able to build on our results while examining additional shift work characteristics will further clarify whether some shift patterns have a greater impact on obesity than others.""","""['Anne Grundy', 'Michelle Cotterchio', 'Victoria A Kirsh', 'Victoria Nadalin', 'Nancy Lightfoot', 'Nancy Kreiger']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Health Promot Chronic Dis Prev Can""","""['Meta-analysis on shift work and risks of specific obesity types.', 'Night shift work exposure profile and obesity: Baseline results from a Chinese night shift worker cohort.', 'Rotating night shift work and adherence to unhealthy lifestyle in predicting risk of type 2 diabetes: results from two large US cohorts of female nurses.', 'Does the association of prostate cancer with night-shift work differ according to rotating vs. fixed schedule?

The 2D NSs acted as an excellent sensing platform in which the PSA aptamer was adsorbed on the NSs and subsequent energy transfer between them led to fluorescence quenching of the aptamer. The detection limit of PSA was achieved to be 13 pM for MoO3 NSs, whereas the MoS2 and MoSe2 systems exhibited a detection limit of 72 and 157 pM, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the ultra-sensitive detection of a 2D NS-based aptamer sensor.

We then introduced the same systematic leaf shifts in two clinical intensity modulated radiotherapy plans (prostate and head and neck cancer). Our results reported differences between the measured planar doses with and without MLC shifts (errors). Independent of the locations of the leaf position shifts and positions of the detectors, for the simple rectangular fields, the MatriXX was able to detect ±2 mm MLC leaf positioning shifts with Gamma index of 3%/3 mm and ±1 mm MLC leaf position shifts with Gamma index of 2%/2 mm. For the clinical plans, measuring the fields individually, leaf positioning shifts of ±2 mm were detected using Gamma index of 3%/3 mm and a passing rate of 95%. When the fields were measured compositely, the Gamma index exhibited less sensitivity for the detection of leaf positioning shifts than when the fields were measured individually.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed all patients at our institution who had undergone PFC. Prostate-specific antigen nadir was determined using 2 or more post-PFC values. Suspicion of BCR was determined using the Phoenix criteria (nadir + 2 ng/ml). At the discretion of the physician, pre-and post-PFC 3-T mpMRIs were obtained and in a few cases biopsies were performed.  Results:   Ninety (58.4%) of 154 consecutive patients who underwent PFC were included in our analysis and had a median (range) age and prostate volume of 66.5 (48-82) years and 40.5 (16-175) ml, respectively. Of those suspected of BCR (37/90, 41.1%), with a median time to BCR of 19.9 (7.0-38.5) months, 27 patients (73.0%) underwent a post-PFC mpMRI. Twenty-two (81.5%) of these mpMRIs were found with 24 suspicious lesions. A considerable number (9/24, 37.5%) of these lesions were located in the central gland of the prostate. Seven of 24 lesions exhibited adverse mpMRI characteristic; 4 (16.7%) had capsular contact, 2 (8.2%) showed frank extracapsular extension, and 1 (4.2%) showed seminal vesicle invasion. Five (45.5%) of 11 patients with positive post-PFC mpMRIs were positive on biopsy (4/5, 80% were clinically significant prostate cancer).

Methods:   Ninety-three patients with suspected Pca were enrolled. For b2000 a two-dimensional spatially-selective RF pulse using an echo-planar transmit trajectory was applied, and the field of view (FOV) was reduced to one-third. All three readers (Reader A: 7, B 4 and C <1 years of experience in prostate MRI) independently evaluated b2000 with regard to the presence of suspicious lesions that displayed increased signal. The results were compared to histopathology obtained by real-time MR/ultrasound fusion and systematic biopsy.  Results:   In 62 patients Pca was confirmed. One significant Pca (Gleason score (GS) 7b) was missed by Reader C. Overall, sensitivity/specificity/positive predictive value/negative predictive value were 90/71/86/79% for Reader A, 87/84/92/76% for Reader B and 85/74/87/72% for Reader C, respectively.

We have characterized the biophysical properties of human LNCaP prostate cancer cells that occur in response to loss of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) under hypoxic stress using an oscillating optical tweezer. Hypoxia and Rb-loss increased cell stiffness in a fashion that was dependent on activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and the protein kinase B (AKT)- mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2, AKT or MTOR impeded hypoxia-inducible changes in the actin cytoskeleton and inhibited cell migration in Rb-deficient cells conditioned with hypoxia. These results suggest that loss of Rb in transformed hypoxic cancer cells affects MEK1/2-ERK/AKT-MTOR signalling and promotes motility.

However, the key sequence-based features enabling a transcript to act as an effective ceRNA are not well understood and a quantitative model associating statistical significance to such features is currently lacking. To identify and assess features characterizing target recognition by PTEN-regulating miRNAs, we analyze multiple datasets from PAR-CLIP experiments in conjunction with RNA-Seq data. We consider a set of miRNAs known to regulate PTEN and identify high-confidence binding sites for these miRNAs on the 3' UTR of protein coding genes. Based on the number and spatial distribution of these binding sites, we calculate a set of probabilistic features that are used to make predictions for novel ceRNAs of PTEN. Using a series of experiments in human prostate cancer cell lines, we validate the highest ranking prediction (TNRC6B) as a ceRNA of PTEN.

We retrospectively report our clinical observations using 4 different treatment activities. Methods: Forty patients with advanced prostate cancer and positive uptake in prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) imaging were treated with 4 GBq of 177Lu activity/80 nmol of precursor, 6 GBq of 177Lu activity/120 nmol of precursor, 7.4 GBq of 177Lu activity/150 nmol of precursor, or 9.3 GBq of 177Lu activity/150 nmol of precursor (10 patients per group) every 2 mo. Safety was checked every 2 wk by laboratory tests, the prostate-specific antigen response was checked every 4 wk, and other effects were assessed by anamnesis. Results: The initial prostate-specific antigen response showed no correlation with treatment activity. However, 2 of 10, 4 of 10, 4 of 10, and 7 of 10 patients receiving doses of 4, 6, 7.4, and 9.3 GBq, respectively, were in partial remission 8 wk after completing all 3 cycles.

We show that for at least one specific application, positron projection imaging (PPI) and PET yield comparable estimates of absolute total tumor activity and that both of these estimates are highly correlated with direct well-counting of these same tumors. These findings further suggest that in this particular application, PPI is a far more efficient data acquisition and processing methodology than PET.  Methods:   Forty-one athymic mice were implanted with PC3 human prostate cancer cells transfected with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA (+)) and one additional animal (for a total of 42) with a control blank vector (PSMA (-)). All animals were injected with [18F] DCFPyl, a ligand for PSMA, and imaged for total tumor radioactivity with PET and PPI. The tumors were then removed, assayed by well counting for total radioactivity and the values between these methods intercompared.  Results:   PET, PPI and well-counter estimates of total tumor radioactivity were highly correlated (R2>0.98) with regression line slopes near unity (0.95<slope≤1.02) and intercepts near zero (-0.001MBq≤intercept ≤0.004MBq).

However, no studies have evaluated for associations between genetic polymorphisms and common symptom clusters (e.g., mood disturbance, sickness behavior).  Objectives:   Examine the associations between cytokine gene polymorphisms and the severity of three distinct symptom clusters (i.e., mood-cognitive, sickness-behavior, treatment-related) in a sample of patients with breast and prostate cancer (n = 157) at the completion of radiation therapy.  Methods:   Symptom severity was assessed using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Symptom clusters were created using exploratory factor analysis. The associations between cytokine gene polymorphisms and the symptom cluster severity scores were evaluated using regression analyses.  Results:   Polymorphisms in C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), interleukin (IL13), and nuclear factor kappa beta 2 (NFKB2) were associated with severity scores for the mood-cognitive symptom cluster. In addition to interferon gamma (IFNG1), the same polymorphism in NFKB2 (i.e., rs1056890) that was associated with the mood-cognitive symptom cluster score was associated with the sickness-behavior symptom cluster. Polymorphisms in interleukin 1 receptor 1 (IL1R1), IL6, and NFKB1 were associated with severity factor scores for the treatment-related symptom cluster.

Furthermore, studies now indicate that dysbiosis of the urinary microbiome is associated with pathological conditions. We propose that the urinary microbiome may influence chronic inflammation observed in the prostate, leading to prostate cancer development and progression. Therefore, we profiled the urinary microbiome in men with positive vs negative biopsies for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Urine was collected from men prior to biopsy for prostate cancer. DNA was extracted from urine pellet samples and subjected to bacterial 16S rDNA Illumina® sequencing and 16S rDNA quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We determined the association between bacterial species and the presence or absence of cancer, cancer grade, and type and degree of prostate inflammation.  Results:   Urine samples revealed diverse bacterial populations. There were no significant differences in α or β diversity and no clear hierarchical clustering of benign or cancer samples. We identified a cluster of pro-inflammatory bacteria previously implicated in urogenital infections in a subset of samples. Many species, including known uropathogens, were significantly and differentially abundant among cancer and benign samples, in low vs higher grade cancers and in relation to prostate inflammation type and degree.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included men with high-risk prostate cancer (PSA>20ng/ml, Gleason score ≥8, or clinical extraprostatic extension) treated between 2001 and 2012. All patients received definitive, dose-escalated external beam RT along with a course of neoadjuvant, concurrent, and adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Each patient also had a treatment planning CT that included the L4-L5 vertebral interface and prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements for at least 2 years following RT. The subcutaneous adipose tissue was contoured on a single axial CT slice at the level of L4-L5. The average CT attenuation, in Hounsfield units (HU), of the structure was calculated and defined as SATHU. SATAREA was defined as the cross-sectional area of the structure (in cm2) that was then normalized by the square of patient height. Biochemical failure (BF) was defined as a PSA rise of 2ng/ml from the nadir. Freedom from BF (FFBF) was calculated from start time of ADT using the Kaplan-Meier method. Estimates of FFBF were stratified by SATHU and SATAREA quartiles.  Results:   A total of 171 men met the inclusion criteria with a median follow-up of 5.6 years.

As a result, more effective therapeutic modalities are needed for the treatment of oral cancer. Consequently, in the present study, we examined the feasibility of using a dual peptide carrier approach, combining an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting peptide with an endosome-disruptive peptide, to mediate targeted delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into EGFR-overexpressing oral cancer cells and induce silencing of the targeted oncogene, cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A).  Materials and methods:   Fluorescence microscopy, real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and in vivo bioimaging of mice containing orthotopic xenograft tumors were used to examine the ability of the dual peptide carrier to mediate specific delivery of bioactive siRNAs into EGFR-overexpressing oral cancer cells/tissues.  Results:   Co-complexation of the EGFR-targeting peptide, GE11R9, with the endosome-disruptive 599 peptide facilitated the specific uptake of siRNAs into oral cancer cells overexpressing EGFR in vitro with optimal gene silencing observed at a 60:30:1 (GE11R9:599:siRNA) molar ratio. Furthermore, when administered systemically to mice bearing xenograft oral tumors, this dual peptide complex mediated increased targeted delivery of siRNAs into tumor tissues in comparison to the 599 peptide alone and significantly enhanced CIP2A silencing.

Amiloride is a drug that selectively reduces the aldosterone-sensitive Na+/K+ exchange and could be effective in the management of mineralocorticoid excess syndrome (MCES).  Methods:   The efficacy of amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) in the clinical management of abiraterone-induced MCES was assessed in 5 consecutive patients with castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Then, using the in vitro experimental model of PCa cell lines, the possible effects of drugs usually used in the clinical management of CRPC patients on PCa cell viability were investigated.  Results:   Amiloride/HCT led to a complete disappearance of all clinical and biochemical signs of abiraterone-induced MCES in the 5 treated patients. The in vitro study showed that abiraterone treatment significantly decreased cell viability of both androgen receptor (AR)-expressing VCaP (vertebral-cancer of the prostate) and LNCaP (lymph node carcinoma of the prostate) cells, with no effect on AR-negative PC-3 cells. Prednisolone, spironolactone, and eplerenone increased LNCaP cell viability, while amiloride reduced it. The non-steroid aldosterone antagonist PF-03882845 did not modify PCa cell viability.

Focal IRE was performed for organ-confined clinically significant PCa, defined as high-volume disease with Gleason sum score 6 (International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade 1) or any Gleason sum score of 7 (ISUP grades 2-3). Oncological, adverse event (AE) and QoL outcome data, with a minimum of 6 months' follow-up, were analysed.

Patients and methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of all TRUS-guided prostate biopsies taken across the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) from January 2012 to March 2015. Natural variation in technique allowed us to evaluate for differences in infection-related hospitalisations based on whether or not a needle disinfectant technique was used. The disinfectant technique was an intra-procedural step to cleanse the biopsy needle with antibacterial solution after each core was sampled (i.e., 10% formalin or 70% isopropyl alcohol). After grouping biopsies according to whether or not the procedure included a needle disinfectant step, we compared the rate of infection-related hospitalisations within 30 days of biopsy. Generalised estimating equation models were fit to adjust for potential confounders.  Results:   During the evaluated period, 17 954 TRUS-guided prostate biopsies were taken with 5 321 (29.6%) including a disinfectant step. The observed rate of infection-related hospitalisation was lower when a disinfectant technique was used during biopsy (0.60% vs 0.90%; P = 0.04). After accounting for differences between groups the adjusted hospitalisation rate in the disinfectant group was 0.85% vs 1.12% in the no disinfectant group (adjusted odds ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.50-1.15; P = 0.19).  Conclusions:   In this observational analysis, hospitalisations for infectious complications were less common when the TRUS-guided prostate biopsy included a needle disinfection step. However, after adjusting for potential confounders the effect of needle disinfection was not statistically significant.

Surrogates for overall survival (OS) could expedite the evaluation of new adjuvant therapies. Methods By June 2013, 102 completed or ongoing randomized trials were identified and individual patient data were collected from 28 trials with 28,905 patients. Disease-free survival (DFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) were determined for 21,140 patients from 24 trials and 12,712 patients from 19 trials, respectively. We evaluated the surrogacy of DFS and MFS for OS by using a two-stage meta-analytic validation model by determining the correlation of an intermediate clinical end point with OS and the correlation of treatment effects on both the intermediate clinical end point and OS. Results Trials enrolled patients from 1987 to 2011. After a median follow-up of 10 years, 45% of 21,140 men and 45% of 12,712 men experienced a DFS and MFS event, respectively. For DFS and MFS, 61% and 90% of the patients, respectively, were from radiation trials, and 63% and 66%, respectively, had high-risk disease. At the patient level, Kendall's τ correlation with OS was 0.85 and 0.91 for DFS and MFS, respectively. At the trial level, R2 was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.90) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.88) from weighted linear regression of 8-year OS rates versus 5-year DFS and MFS rates, respectively. Treatment effects-measured by log hazard ratios-for the surrogates and OS were well correlated ( R2, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.82] for DFS and 0.92 [95% CI, 0.81 to 0.95] for MFS).

The incidence of has been reported at 8-10%, but a molecular and cellular characterization has not been performed on this phenotype.  Methods:   Using freshly digested tissue from surgical specimens, we performed RNA-seq analysis of flow cytometry-purified basal epithelia from 3 patients with and 4 patients without a majority BCH phenotype. qPCR was performed on 28 genes identified as significant from 13 non-BCH and 7 BCH specimens to confirm transcriptomic analysis. IHC was performed on several non-BCH and BCH specimens for 3 proteins identified as significant by transcriptomic analysis.  Results:   A total of 141 human BPH specimens were analyzed for the presence of BCH. Clinical characteristics of non-BCH and BCH cohorts revealed no significant differences in age, PSA, prostate volume, medical treatment, or comorbidities. Quantitation of cellular subsets by flow cytometry in 11 BCH patients vs. 11 non-BCH patients demonstrated a significant increase in the ratio of basal to luminal epithelia in patients with BCH (P <0.05), but no significant differences in the total number of leukocytes. RNA-seq data from flow cytometry isolated basal epithelia from patients with and without BCH were subjected to gene set enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes, which revealed increased expression of members of the epidermal differentiation complex. Transcriptomic data were complemented by immunohistochemistry for members of the epidermal differentiation complex, revealing a morphological similarity to other stratified squamous epithelial layers.

Prostate and breast cancer incidence and mortality data (1975-2013) were obtained from the NORDCAN database. Joinpoint regression models were used to identify changes in the trends. A more prominent increase in prostate than breast cancer incidence was observed. From the mid-1990s, mortality rates in patients below 75 years of age have decreased for both cancers in all four countries. The relative decline in breast cancer mortality from 1985-1989 to 2009-2013 were largest in women under 50 years of age, with reductions in mortality rates ranging from 38% in Finland to 55% in Denmark. In the age group 55-74 years, mortality rates for prostate cancer declined more than for breast cancer in all countries except Denmark, ranging from 14% in Denmark to 39% in Norway. The substantial decrease in breast cancer mortality in women below regular screening age and the reductions in mortality from both cancers in Denmark from the mid-1990s are consistent with beneficial contributions from improved treatment besides mammography screening and increased PSA testing.

It is reported that EZH2 can directly down-regulate RUNX3 by increasing histone H3 methylation. However, the role of EZH2 in the development and progression of laryngeal carcinoma has not yet been investigated, and the relationship between EZH2 and RUNX3 in laryngeal carcinoma is rarely reported. The current study aims to determine the role of EZH2 in the progression of laryngeal carcinoma, and investigate the interaction between EZH2 and the tumor suppressor RUNX3. Our study found that EZH2 is overexpressed in laryngeal carcinoma patients, and silencing EZH2 by EZH2 siRNA significantly inhibited the proliferation of laryngeal carcinoma cells. Besides, we also found that RUNX3 is repressed in laryngeal carcinoma patients. Moreover, RUNX3 as a downstream target protein of EZH2 is up-regulated by EZH2 siRNA accompanied by a decrease in the trimethylation modification pattern of H3K27. RUNX3 siRNA inhibits the decreased proliferation induced by EZH2 siRNA.

Methods:   A total of 23 prostate cancer patients with biochemical relapse, of which 13 were castration sensitive (CS) and 10 castration resistant (CR), were treated with intensity-modulated and image-guided RT (IMRT-IGRT) on ≤3 metastases detected by 68Ga PSMA PET-CT. Androgen deprivation therapy was continued in CR patients.  Results:   A total of 38 metastases were treated. The involved sites were pelvic bone (n = 16), pelvic lymph nodes (n = 11), paraaortic lymph nodes (n = 6), ribs (n = 3) and vertebral body (n = 2). The median PSA prior to RT was 1.1 ng/mL (range 0.1-29.0 ng/mL). A median dose of 43.5 Gy (range 30-64 Gy) was delivered by IMRT-IGRT in 12-27 fractions. At a median follow-up of 7 months (range 2-17 months), 19 patients (83%) were in remission. Four patients (17%) developed distant recurrences. The actuarial 1-year LC, PFS and OS rates were 100, 51 (95% CI 8-83%) and 100%. Univariate analysis demonstrated a statistically significantly better PFS in CS patients as compared to CR patients (1-year PFS 67 vs. 0%, p < 0.01). One patient experienced grade 2 acute gastrointestinal toxicity. Grade 3 or more toxicity events were not observed.  Conclusions:   By providing optimal LC, low toxicity and a promising PFS in CS patients, the current retrospective study illustrated that 68Ga PSMA PET-CT-guided RT may be an attractive treatment strategy in patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer.

IgE antibodies may be major players in protective responses against tumours, through engendering antigen presentation and enhancing adaptive immune responses targeted towards a specific allergen, but potentially also against tumour-associated antigens such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA). We therefore cross-sectionally investigated associations between circulating levels of PSA and IgE in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2006.  Methods:   We focused on all men aged 40+ years with measurements for PSA and IgE, and no previous diagnosis of prostate cancer (n = 1312). We estimated the association between total and specific IgE concentration and levels of PSA with logistic regression models, adjusted for age, ethnicity/race, education, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), physical activity status, and history of asthma.  Results:   Both total IgE and the sum of specific IgE were inversely associated with the risk of having PSA levels ≥10 ng/mL, though most findings were not statistically significant. The odds ratios for the second and third tertile of total IgE as compared to the first were 0.21 (95% CI 0.06-0.72) and 0.42 (0.08-2.31). The odds ratio for sum of abnormal specific IgE measurements was 0.77 (0.44-1.34).  Conclusion:   Despite statistical insignificance, the observed trend warrants further research given the increasing evidence of the role of atopy and IgE antibodies in protective responses against tumours.

We also investigated their impact on ultrasound (US) imaging and therapy of prostate cancer. PTX-A10-3.2-PLGA NBs were developed using water-in-oil-in-water (water/oil/water) double emulsion and carbodiimide chemistry approaches. Fluorescence imaging together with flow cytometry verified that the PTX-A10-3.2-PLGA NBs were successfully fabricated and could specifically bond to PSMA-positive LNCaP cells. We speculated that, in vivo, the PTX-A10-3.2-PLGA NBs would travel for a long time, efficiently aim at prostate cancer cells, and sustainably release the loaded PTX due to the improved permeability together with the retention impact and US-triggered drug delivery. The results demonstrated that the combination of PTX-A10-3.2-PLGA NBs with low-frequency US achieved high drug release, a low 50% inhibition concentration, and significant cell apoptosis in vitro. For mouse prostate tumor xenografts, the use of PTX-A10-3.2-PLGA NBs along with low-frequency US achieved the highest tumor inhibition rate, prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing nude mice without obvious systemic toxicity. Moreover, LNCaP xenografts in mice were utilized to observe modifications in the parameters of PTX-A10-3.2-PLGA and PTX-PLGA NBs in the contrast mode and the allocation of fluorescence-labeled PTX-A10-3.2-PLGA and PTX-PLGA NBs in live small animals and laser confocal scanning microscopy fluorescence imaging. These results demonstrated that PTX-A10-3.2-PLGA NBs showed high gray-scale intensity and aggregation ability and showed a notable signal intensity in contrast mode as well as aggregation ability in fluorescence imaging.

Zinc is concentrated in healthy prostate 10-fold higher than any other tissue, and an >80% decrease in zinc is observed in PCa specimens. Here, we studied the effect of overexpression of the entire 4.8 kb miR-183 family cluster, including the intergenic region which contains highly conserved genomic regions, in prostate cells.

Methods:   NCI-60 cancer cell panel and four normal cell lines were cultured in vitro in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% Hyclone fetal bovine serum and exposed for 48 h to 5 μM, 25 μM and 50 μM of peptides 9R, 9S1R and 124R. Viability was assessed by CCK-8 assay. For peptide ATP depletion effects, one cell line representing each organ in the NCI-60 panel, and four normal cell lines were exposed to 50 μM of peptides 9R, 9S1R and 124R for 3 h. The ATP content was assessed in whole cells, and their supernatants.  Results:   Peptides 9S1R and 9R are respectively lethal to 95 and 81.6% of the 60 cancer cell lines tested. Control peptide 124R has no effect on the growth of these cells. Especially interesting the fact that peptides 9R and 9S1R are capable of killing drug-resistant and hormone-resistant cell lines, and even cancer stem cells. Peptides 9R and 9S1R have a broader activity spectrum than many cancer drugs in current use, can completely deplete cellular ATP within 3 h, and are less toxic to 3 of the 4 normal cell lines tested than they are to several cancers.  Conclusions:   Nullomer peptides 9R and 9S1R have a large broad lethal effect on cancer cell lines derived from nine organs represented in the NCI-60 panel. This broad activity crosses many of the categorical divisions used in the general classification of cancers: solid vs liquid cancers, drug sensitive vs drug resistant, hormone sensitive vs hormone resistant, cytokine sensitive vs cytokine non sensitive, slow growing vs rapid growing, differentiated vs dedifferentiated cancers.

To address the limited availability of viable CTCs for fundamental and clinical investigations, effective separation of extremely rare CTCs from blood is critical. Ferrohydrodynamic cell separation (FCS), a label-free method that conducted cell sorting based on cell size difference in biocompatible ferrofluids, has thus far not been able to enrich low-concentration CTCs from cancer patients' blood because of technical challenges associated with processing clinical samples. In this study, we demonstrated the development of a laminar-flow microfluidic FCS device that was capable of enriching rare CTCs from patients' blood in a biocompatible manner with a high throughput (6 mL h-1) and a high rate of recovery (92.9%). Systematic optimization of the FCS devices through a validated analytical model was performed to determine optimal magnetic field and its gradient, ferrofluid properties, and cell throughput that could process clinically relevant amount of blood. We first validated the capability of the FCS devices by successfully separating low-concentration (∼100 cells per mL) cancer cells using six cultured cell lines from undiluted white blood cells (WBCs), with an average 92.9% cancer cell recovery rate and an average 11.7% purity of separated cancer cells, at a throughput of 6 mL per hour. Specifically, at ∼100 cancer cells per mL spike ratio, the recovery rates of cancer cells were 92.3 ± 3.6% (H1299 lung cancer), 88.3 ± 5.5% (A549 lung cancer), 93.7 ± 5.5% (H3122 lung cancer), 95.3 ± 6.0% (PC-3 prostate cancer), 94.7 ± 4.0% (MCF-7 breast cancer), and 93.0 ± 5.3% (HCC1806 breast cancer), and the corresponding purities of separated cancer cells were 11.1 ± 1.2% (H1299 lung cancer), 10.1 ± 1.7% (A549 lung cancer), 12.1 ± 2.1% (H3122 lung cancer), 12.8 ± 1.6% (PC-3 prostate cancer), 11.9 ± 1.8% (MCF-7 breast cancer), and 12.2 ± 1.6% (HCC1806 breast cancer). Biocompatibility study on H1299 cell line and HCC1806 cell line showed that separated cancer cells had excellent short-term viability, normal proliferation and unaffected key biomarker expressions. We then demonstrated the enrichment of CTCs in blood samples obtained from two patients with newly diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The phase III PROSELICA study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01308580) assessed the noninferiority of cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 (C20) versus C25 in postdocetaxel patients with mCRPC. Methods Patients were stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, measurability of disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and region, and randomly assigned to receive C20 or C25. To claim noninferiority of C20 (maintenance of ≥ 50% of the OS benefit of C25 v mitoxantrone in TROPIC) with 95% confidence level, the upper boundary of the CI of the hazard ratio (HR) for C20 versus C25 could not exceed 1.214 under a one-sided 98.89% CI after interim analyses. Secondary end points included progression-free survival, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), tumor and pain responses and progression, health-related quality of life, and safety. Results Overall, 1,200 patients were randomly assigned (C20, n = 598; C25, n = 602). Baseline characteristics were similar in both arms. Median OS was 13.4 months for C20 and 14.5 months for C25 (HR, 1.024). The upper boundary of the HR CI was 1.184 (less than the 1.214 noninferiority margin). Significant differences were observed in favor of C25 for PSA response (C20, 29.5%; C25, 42.9%; nominal P < .001) and time to PSA progression (median: C20, 5.7 months; C25, 6.8 months; HR for C20 v C25, 1.195; 95% CI, 1.025 to 1.393). Health-related quality of life did not differ between cohorts. Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were 39.7% for C20 and 54.5% for C25.

Methods:   Calendar year patient cohorts (2005-2013) with breast, colorectal, lung, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian, or prostate cancer and receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy were identified within the Marketscan database. Incidence of ESA treatment and transfusion were estimated in each year, as was median number of ESA administrations. Clinical characteristics associated with ESA administration and transfusions were evaluated by using multivariable logistic regression. Additionally, annual new ESA user cohorts within the Oncology Services Comprehensive Electronic Records database (2011-2014) were examined to assess hemoglobin levels at ESA initiation.  Results:   Across all tumor types, ESA use decreased substantially (breast cancer: 53.7 to 3.2%; lung cancer: 66.0 to 13.3%, non-Hodgkin lymphoma: 39.8 to 3.8%), transfusion use increased (2 to 5.5%, 5.5 to 18.2%, and 4.5 to 9.1%, respectively), and median number of ESA administrations declined. Across all tumor types, proportion of patients initiating an ESA with hemoglobin >10 g/dL was <10% from 2011 onward. In recent years, cancer patients who are older, female, and have chronic kidney disease or moderate or severe liver disease were most likely to receive ESAs.  Conclusion:   Subsequent to important regulatory and reimbursement ESA-related actions, total ESA exposure among cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy declined substantially. Today, fewer patients receive ESA therapy, and among those treated, more are initiated at hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL and are exposed for a shorter duration, consistent with current product labeling.""","""['Prasad L Gawade', 'Jesse A Berlin', 'David H Henry', 'Dianne Tomita', 'Barry D Brooks', 'Janet Franklin', 'Brian D Bradbury', 'Cathy W Critchlow']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf""","""['Use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents among chemotherapy patients with hemoglobin exceeding 12 grams per deciliter.', 'Impact of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services national coverage determination on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent and transfusion use in chemotherapy-treated cancer patients.', 'Adherence to guidelines for use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia: results of a retrospective study of an electronic medical-records database in the United States, 2002-2006.', 'Blood utilization and hemoglobin levels in cancer patients after label and coverage changes for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.', 'Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs): do they still have a role in chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA)?', 'Erythropoietin inhibits chemotherapy-induced cell death and promotes a senescence-like state in leukemia cells.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 5,214 consecutive patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy from January 2013 to December 2014 at UroPartners, a large urology group comprising 28 clinics in metropolitan Chicago. At 1 microbiology laboratory all swabs were processed, the presence of fluoroquinolone resistant gram-negative rods was identified and sensitivity tests were performed. Prophylaxis for biopsy was guided by rectal swab culture. Characteristics of patients with and without infectious complications were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests. Multivariable logistic regression was done to determine predictors of infectious complications. Analyses were performed with R, version 2.14.2 (https://www.r-project.org/).  Results:   Of the 5,214 biopsies performed 56 infectious (1.1%) and 24 sepsis complications (0.46%) were found.

Methods and materials:   Urine samples of 64 prostate RT patients were collected before, at regular intervals during, and 3 months after RT. Occludin expression analysis was performed, and bladder wall echogenicity and echotexture were investigated by ultrasound and the gray-scale histogram analysis method. The bladder equivalent uniform dose (EUD) was derived from individually produced dose treatment plan for each patient. Clinical scoring for bladder-specific symptoms was done using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria Scale.  Results:   Thirty patients (47%) experienced at least 1 of the studied bladder symptoms (grade ≥1 endpoints), including urinary pain, frequency, urgency, straining, incontinence, hematuria, dysuria, and nocturia. For these patients there were significant changes in urine occludin levels after starting the treatment compared with the baseline urine samples (P=.023). The mean bladder EUD that caused a significant change in occludin level, which occurred after the 15th RT session, was 26.9 Gy (range, 13.2-36.5 Gy, P=.020). In all patients a significant reduction in bladder echogenicity (P=.0137) and a significant change in its echotexture (P=.047) was found after the 10th RT session, after which the EUD to the bladder reached 17.9 Gy (range, 8.8-24.3 Gy).

Methods and materials:   Between 2003 and 2013, 2608 patients from 3 centers were treated with IO-LDRB as single-modality treatment for low or low-tier intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Databases from the 3 centers have been analyzed. These independent databases were collected prospectively. Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were then compared, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) were generated, and the Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine factors predicting for relapse.  Results:   A total of 2608 patients with a median follow-up of 4.7 (interquartile range, 3.1-6.9) years were analyzed. Median age was 64 (range, 42-84) years. In these patients, median initial prostate-specific antigen was 5.5 ng/mL, 74% were T1, and 26% were T2; 73% were Gleason 6, and 25% Gleason 7. Median percentage of biopsy cores positive was 33%, and median gland volume was 34.2 cm3. Eleven percent of patients received hormones for a median of 3.0 months before implantation. Median seed activity was 0.437 mCi, D90 (dose covering 90% of the prostate volume) was 186.7 Gy, and V100 was 99.37%.

The association between urinary symptom flare and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) bounce was investigated.  Methods:   Changes in the IPSS and OABSS were prospectively recorded in 355 patients who underwent seed implantation. The percentage distribution of patients according to the difference between the flare peak and post-implant nadir was plotted to define significant increases in the scores. The clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment parameters, and post-implant dosimetric parameters were compared between the non-flare and flare groups. PSA bounce was defined as an elevation of ≥0.1 ng/mL or ≥0.4 ng/mL compared to the previous lowest value, followed by a decrease to a level at or below the pre-bounce value.  Results:   A clinically significant increase required an IPSS increase of at least 12 points and an OABSS increase of at least 6 points based on a time-course analysis of total scores and the QOL index. Assessment only by IPSS failed to detect 40 patients (11%) who had urinary symptom flare according to the OABSS. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that patients treated with higher biologically effective doses and those without diabetes mellitus had higher risks of urinary flare. There was no statistical correlation between the incidence and time of urinary symptom flare onset and that of a PSA bounce.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first report to prove the clinical potential of the OABSS as an assessment tool for urinary symptom flare after seed implantation. Our findings showed that persistent lower urinary tract symptoms after seed implantation were attributed to storage rather than to voiding issues.

Methods:   ACI per 100,000 insured persons for breast, prostate and colorectal cancer were estimated using BARMER Statutory Health Insurance claims data. Incident cancer cases were defined as having an in- or outpatient diagnosis in 2013, no diagnosis in a lookback period of 1 year and a second diagnosis (or death) in a confirmation period of 1 quarter. We varied lookback periods from 1 to 7 years, confirmation periods from 1 to 4 quarters as well as the definition of confirmatory events and compared ACI estimates to cancer registry data.  Results:   ACI were higher for breast (138.7) and prostate (103.6) but lower for colorectal cancer (42.1) when compared to cancer registries (119.3, 98.0 and 45.5, respectively).

Conclusions:   The choice of lookback and confirmation periods and the definition of confirmatory events have considerable impact on the number of incident cancer cases identified and ACI estimated. Researchers need to be aware of potential misclassification when identifying incident cancer cases in administrative data.

The coexistence of genital warts (GW) and certain cancers and an association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and various malignancies have been reported. Therefore, we conducted this large national study to analyze the risk of malignancies among men and women with GW in Taiwan.  Methods and findings:   Between January 2000 and December 2013, approximately 3 million patients were reported to the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Of these patients, 21,763 were diagnosed with GW. In the same time period, a total of 213,541 cancer cases were reported to the registry, of which 1002 were recorded among patients with GW. The age-specific incidence rates of GW and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of malignancies compared to the general population were calculated. Women acquired GW earlier than men, with a mean age at diagnosis of 32.63±12.78 years. The highest incidence rate for both genders peaked at 20-29 years. Of the 1002 patients with GW and malignancies, the SIR was 1.95 (95%CI 1.83-2.07). The most markedly increased risk was found for HPV-related cancers, with a SIR of 9.74 (95%CI 3.70-15.77). Significantly elevated risks were also noted for smoking-related cancers, anogenital cancers, cervix in situ, colon, rectum, lung, kidney, and prostate cancers.

In this work, we examined whether postdiagnosis statin use was associated with reduced cancer-specific mortality or all-cause mortality among patients with prostate cancer in Denmark. Material and Methods From nationwide Danish registries, we identified all patients with incident prostate adenocarcinoma from 1998 to 2011 and retrieved data on tumor and patient characteristics, drug use, and primary treatment. We defined postdiagnosis use (two or more prescriptions) of statins as a time-varying covariate with 1-year lag. Cox proportional hazards regression models used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for prostate cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality through 2013 associated with postdiagnosis statin use. In secondary and sensitivity analyses, we assessed statin use within exposure periods of 1 year or 5 years after prostate cancer diagnosis and evaluated the influence of prediagnosis statin use. Results Among 31,790 patients, 7,365 died of prostate cancer and 11,811 died from other causes during a median follow-up of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 1.3 to 5.1 years) from 1 year after diagnosis. Postdiagnosis statin use was associated with adjusted HRs of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.89) for prostate cancer mortality and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.85) for all-cause mortality. Similar results were observed in 1-year and 5-year sensitivity analyses. No substantial effect measure modification was found with estimated dose or type of statin, clinical stage, Gleason score, or with prediagnosis statin use; however, patients who were diagnosed early in the study period or who underwent radical prostatectomy or endocrine therapy exhibited slightly lower HRs for prostate cancer mortality with postdiagnosis statin use than did those in the overall analyses.

Rarely, colonic involvement is seen and it is generally due to direct extension to the rectum. It is exceedingly uncommon for distant metastasis to occur in the right colon and small bowel. We present a case of prostatic adenocarcinoma metastasizing to the appendiceal orifice in a 78-year-old male. Our patient had a history of adenocarcinoma of the prostate diagnosed four years prior to presentation. He also had a history of adenocarcinoma of the distal colon 30 years prior which resulted in a partial colectomy and permanent diverting colostomy. Prior to his presentation, follow-up colonoscopies failed to reveal disease progression or additional malignancy. During routine colonoscopy, he was found to have a 2.5 cm polyp near the appendiceal orifice. Histologically the polyp demonstrated colonic mucosa with an infiltration of the lamina propria by individual cells with abundant cytoplasm and round nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The neoplastic cells were strongly positive for PSA and negative for CK7, CK20, and CDX2 supporting a diagnosis of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma. Metastatic disease of extracolonic origin arising in a polyp is extremely uncommon, but metastases have been reported to involve breast, ovary, stomach, esophagus, and kidney. This case contributes to the scarce information available regarding metastatic spread of prostate cancer to the ascending colon and enlightens the community of pathologists, surgeons, gastroenterologists, and urologists about this unusual presentation of a common carcinoma.""","""['Brian Joel Tjarks', 'DesiRae Muirhead']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""S D Med""","""['The role of P501S and PSA in the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Diagnosis and Management of Lynch Syndrome.', 'Coexisting tubular adenoma with a neuroendocrine carcinoma of colon allowing early surgical intervention and implicating a shared stem cell origin.', 'Management of malignant colon polyps: current status and controversies.', 'Metastatic lymph node collision of a prostatic adenocarcinoma and an urothelial carcinoma and review of the literature.']"""

The therapeutic implications of these mutations remain incompletely understood. Here we analyzed changes in the ubiquitin landscape induced by endometrial cancer-associated SPOP mutations and identified BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 proteins (BETs) as SPOP-CUL3 substrates that are preferentially degraded by endometrial cancer-associated SPOP mutants. The resulting reduction of BET protein levels sensitized cancer cells to BET inhibitors. Conversely, prostate cancer-specific SPOP mutations resulted in impaired degradation of BETs, promoting their resistance to pharmacologic inhibition.

BET proteins enhance the oncogenic functions of major cancer drivers by elevating the expression of these drivers, such as c-Myc in leukemia, or by promoting the transcriptional activities of oncogenic factors, such as AR and ERG in prostate cancer. Pathologically, BET proteins are frequently overexpressed and are clinically linked to various types of human cancer; they are therefore being pursued as attractive therapeutic targets for selective inhibition in patients with cancer. To this end, a number of bromodomain inhibitors, including JQ1 and I-BET, have been developed and have shown promising outcomes in early clinical trials. Although resistance to BET inhibitors has been documented in preclinical models, the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance are largely unknown. Here we report that cullin-3SPOP earmarks BET proteins, including BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Pathologically, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants fail to interact with and promote the degradation of BET proteins, leading to their elevated abundance in SPOP-mutant prostate cancer. As a result, prostate cancer cell lines and organoids derived from individuals harboring SPOP mutations are more resistant to BET-inhibitor-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, our results elucidate the tumor-suppressor role of SPOP in prostate cancer in which it acts as a negative regulator of BET protein stability and also provide a molecular mechanism for resistance to BET inhibitors in individuals with prostate cancer bearing SPOP mutations.""","""['Xiangpeng Dai', 'Wenjian Gan', 'Xiaoning Li', 'Shangqian Wang', 'Wei Zhang', 'Ling Huang', 'Shengwu Liu', 'Qing Zhong', 'Jianping Guo', 'Jinfang Zhang', 'Ting Chen', 'Kouhei Shimizu', 'Francisco Beca', 'Mirjam Blattner', 'Divya Vasudevan', 'Dennis L Buckley', 'Jun Qi', 'Lorenz Buser', 'Pengda Liu', 'Hiroyuki Inuzuka', 'Andrew H Beck', 'Liewei Wang', 'Peter J Wild', 'Levi A Garraway', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Christopher E Barbieri', 'Kwok-Kin Wong', 'Senthil K Muthuswamy', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Yu Chen', 'James E Bradner', 'Wenyi Wei']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nat Med""","""['Prostate cancer: Place your BETs.', 'Prostate cancer: BET inhibitors - SPOP right there!', 'Re: Prostate Cancer-Associated SPOP Mutations Confer Resistance to BET Inhibitors through Stabilization of BRD4.', 'Intrinsic BET inhibitor resistance in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer is mediated by BET protein stabilization and AKT-mTORC1 activation.', 'Opposing effects of cancer-type-specific SPOP mutants on BET protein degradation and sensitivity to BET inhibitors.', 'SPOP-mediated degradation of BRD4 dictates cellular sensitivity to BET inhibitors.', 'Small-Molecule Targeting of BET Proteins in Cancer.', 'BET bromodomain inhibitors--a novel epigenetic approach in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Deficiency of BAP1 inhibits neuroblastoma tumorigenesis through destabilization of MYCN.', 'Identification of novel and potent dual-targeting HDAC1/SPOP inhibitors using structure-based virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation and evaluation of in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity.', 'BET Bromodomain Inhibitors: Novel Design Strategies and Therapeutic Applications.', 'Interrogating bromodomain inhibitor resistance in KMT2A-rearranged leukemia through combinatorial CRISPR screens.', 'Systematic analysis of the BET family in adrenocortical carcinoma: The expression, prognosis, gene regulation network, and regulation targets.']"""

Methods:   The electronic medical records of 130 consecutive patients with histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent post-prostatectomy RT between January 2008 and December 2014 were analysed. Primary endpoint was Biochemical Recurrence (BCR) after RT. BCR was defined by PSA > 0.2 ng/mL and BCR endpoints were analysed using Kaplan-Meier methods. The impact of RT technique and the rates of acute and late toxicities are also reported. Toxicities were graded according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria.  Results:   Median follow-up time after RT (regardless of technique) was 28 months. BCR occurred in 32 of the 126 patients (25%) whose prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels have been monitored post-RT. At 24 and 36 months, 85% and 75% of patients were BCR-free, respectively. Patients with a pre-RT PSA above 0.2 ng/mL had a higher probability of recurrence than patients with values below 0.2 ng/mL (P = 0.03). RT technique, pelvic nodal irradiation, androgen deprivation therapy, T staging or surgical margin did not significantly impact BCR results. No patient experienced acute toxicities greater than grade 2. Grade 1 or 2 late gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity occurred in 11% and 1 patient experienced a grade 3 event. 12% of patients developed grade 1 or 2 late genitourinary (GU) toxicity, with evidence of grade 3 severity in only 1 patient. Evidence of a trend in reduction in late GI toxicity with the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) was apparent but not with late GU toxicity.  Conclusion:   At our regional centre, early RT (PSA < 0.2 ng/mL) was associated with significant improvement in BCR-free survival. Rates of toxicity mirror those of landmark trials which suggest no detriment for our regional prostate cancer patients. The use of IMRT/VMAT techniques was associated with a trend towards reduced rates of GI toxicity.""","""['Luke Nicholls', 'Amber Winter', 'Ashley Harwood', 'Ashley Plank', 'Preeti Bagga', 'Winnie Wong', 'Eric Khoo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Med Radiat Sci""","""['Moderate Hypofractionated Postprostatectomy Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy With Daily Image Guidance (VMAT-IGRT): A\xa0Mono-institutional Report on Feasibility and Acute Toxicity.', 'Image Guided Hypofractionated Postprostatectomy Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Transitioning from conformal radiotherapy to intensity-modulated radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: Clinical benefit, oncologic outcomes and incidence of gastrointestinal and urinary toxicities.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Late toxicity rates following definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'We can and do make a difference by improving medical radiation services in rural and remote locations.']"""

The serum levels of chromogranin A (CgA), neurone-specific enolase (NSE) were measured in 67 mCRPC patients without AA treatment and 48 patients after the failure of AA treatment, in which these markers were also measured in 34 patients before and after 6 months of AA treatment. Comparative t-test was used to evaluate the serial changes of serum NED markers during AA treatment and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test the influence of AA treatment on NED.  Results:   Serum CgA were NSE were evaluated to be above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 56 (48.7%) and 29 (25.2%) patients before chemotherapy.

Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level has been extensively used as a biomarker to detect PCa. However, PSA is not cancer-specific and various non-malignant conditions, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), can cause a rise in PSA blood levels, thus leading to many false positive results.  Objectives:   In this study, we evaluated the potential of urinary metabolomic profiling for discriminating PCa from BPH.  Methods:   Urine samples from 64 PCa patients and 51 individuals diagnosed with BPH were analysed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR). Comparative analysis of urinary metabolomic profiles was carried out using multivariate and univariate statistical approaches.  Results:   The urine metabolomic profile of PCa patients is characterised by increased concentrations of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), glutamate and pseudouridine, and decreased concentrations of glycine, dimethylglycine, fumarate and 4-imidazole-acetate compared with individuals diagnosed with BPH.

Sweden used a 2-yr screening interval and showed a larger mortality reduction than Finland with a 4-yr interval and higher PSA cut-off.  Objective:   To evaluate the impact of screening interval and PSA cut-off on PC detection and mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analysed the core age groups (55-69 yr at entry) of the Finnish (N=31 866) and Swedish (N=5901) screening arms at 13 yr and 16 yr of follow-up. Sweden used a screening interval of 2 yr and a PSA cut-off of 3.0ng/ml, while in Finland the screening interval was 4 yr and the PSA cut-off 4.0ng/ml (or PSA 3.0-3.9ng/ml with free PSA<16%).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We compared PC detection rate and PC mortality between the Finnish and Swedish centres and estimated the impact of different screening protocols.  Results and limitations:   If the Swedish screening protocol had been followed in Finland, 122 additional PC cases would have been diagnosed at screening, 84% of which would have been low-risk cancers, and four leading to PC death. In contrast, if a lower PSA threshold had been applied in Finland, at least 127 additional PC would have been found, with 19 PC deaths.  Conclusions:   The small number of deaths among cases that would have been potentially detectable in Finland with the Swedish protocol (or those that would have been missed in Sweden with the Finnish approach) is unlikely to explain the differences in mortality in this long of a follow-up.

Materials and methods:   One hundred and seventy-three patients were included in this retrospective study. Eighty-seven patients received intravenous HBB prior to scanning (HBB group) and 86 patients did not (non-HBB group). Multiparametric (mp) 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 32-channel body coil. Two radiologists independently evaluated the image quality of T2-weighted imaging (WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, using a five-point Likert scale.

There was a trend towards a lower number of corrupted data points from the contrast curve (2.47±2.44 versus 3.68±2.64), but this did not reach significance (p=0.052).

To better understand the basic molecular mechanisms, we investigated simvastatin-regulated targets during simvastatin-induced cell death in DU145 cells using two-dimensional (2D) proteomic analysis. Thus, vimentin, Ras-related protein Rab-1B (RAB1B), cytoplasmic hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (cHMGCS), thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 (TXNDC5), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), and isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase 1 (IDI1) protein spots were identified as simvastatin-regulated targets involved in DU145 cell death signaling pathways. Moreover, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly inhibited the upregulation of NDRG1 and IDI protein levels by combination treatment of docetaxel and simvastatin.

An intraprostatic gold fiducial marker (GFM) appears hyperintense on CT. On T2-weighted (T2w) MRI target delineation images, the GFM appear as a small signal void similar to calcifications and post biopsy fibrosis. It can therefore be difficult to identify the markers without CT. Detectability of GFMs can be improved using additional MR images, which are manually registered to target delineation images. This task requires manual labor, and is associated with interoperator differences and image registration errors. The aim of this work was to develop and evaluate an automatic method for identification of GFMs directly in the target delineation images without the need for image registration.  Methods:   T2w images, intended for target delineation, and multiecho gradient echo (MEGRE) images intended for GFM identification, were acquired for prostate cancer patients. Signal voids in the target delineation images were identified as GFM candidates. The GFM appeared as round, symmetric, signal void with increasing area for increasing echo time in the MEGRE images. These image features were exploited for automatic identification of GFMs in a MATLAB model using a patient training dataset (n = 20). The model was validated on an independent patient dataset (n = 40). The distances between the identified GFM in the target delineation images and the GFM in CT images were measured. A human observatory study was conducted to validate the use of MEGRE images.  Results:   The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the automatic method and the observatory study was 84%, 74%, 81% and 98%, 94%, 97%, respectively. The mean absolute difference in the GFM distances for the automatic method and observatory study was 1.28 ± 1.25 mm and 1.14 ± 1.06 mm, respectively.  Conclusions:   Multiecho gradient echo images were shown to be a feasible and reliable way to perform GFM identification. For clinical practice, visual inspection of the results from the automatic method is needed at the current stage.""","""['Christian Gustafsson', 'Juha Korhonen', 'Emilia Persson', 'Adalsteinn Gunnlaugsson', 'Tufve Nyholm', 'Lars E Olsson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Investigation of the clinical inter-observer bias in prostate fiducial marker image registration between CT and MR images.', 'Using C-Arm X-ray images from marker insertion to confirm the gold fiducial marker identification in an MRI-only prostate radiotherapy workflow.', 'A generative adversarial network-based (GAN-based) architecture for automatic fiducial marker detection in prostate MRI-only radiotherapy simulation images.', 'Modern radiation therapy planning and image-guided radiotherapy using the example of prostate cancer.', 'Imaging for target volume delineation in rectal cancer radiotherapy--a systematic review.', 'Fluoroscopy- and CT-Guided Gold Fiducial Marker Placement for Intraoperative Localization during Spinal Surgery: Review of 179 Cases at a Single Institution-Technique and Safety Profile.', 'MRI-only radiotherapy from an economic perspective: Can new techniques in prostate cancer treatment be cost saving?', 'Investigation of the clinical inter-observer bias in prostate fiducial marker image registration between CT and MR images.', 'Accuracy of an MR-only workflow for prostate radiotherapy using semi-automatically burned-in fiducial markers.', 'Target definition in radiotherapy of prostate cancer using magnetic resonance imaging only workflow.']"""

Materials and methods:   Ninety-four patients with recurrent PC underwent a single-injection/dual-imaging protocol with contrast-enhanced PET/CT followed by fully diagnostic PET/MR. Imaging datasets were read separately by two reader teams (team 1 and 2) assessing the presence of local recurrence, lymph node and bone metastases in predefined regions using a five-point scale. Detection rates were calculated. The diagnostic performance of PET/CT vs. PET/MR was compared using ROC analysis. Inter-observer and inter-modality variability, radiation exposure, and mean imaging time were evaluated. Clinical follow-up, imaging, and/or histopathology served as standard of reference (SOR).  Results:   Seventy-five patients qualified for the final image analysis. A total of 188 regions were regarded as positive: local recurrence in 37 patients, 87 regions with lymph node metastases, and 64 regions with bone metastases. Mean detection rate between both readers teams for PET/MR was 84.7% compared to 77.3% for PET/CT (p > 0.05). Local recurrence was identified significantly more often in PET/MR compared to PET/CT by team 1. Lymph node and bone metastases were identified significantly more often in PET/CT compared to PET/MR by both teams. However, this difference was not present in the subgroup of patients with PSA values ≤2 ng/ml. Inter-modality and inter-observer agreement (K > 0.6) was moderate to substantial for nearly all categories. Mean reduction of radiation exposure for PET/MR compared to PET/CT was 79.7% (range, 72.6-86.2%). Mean imaging time for PET/CT was substantially lower (18.4 ± 0.7 min) compared to PET/MR (50.4 ± 7.9 min).  Conclusions: 11C-choline PET/MR is a robust imaging modality for restaging biochemical recurrent PC and interpretations between different readers are consistent. It provides a higher diagnostic value for detecting local recurrence compared to PET/CT with the advantage of substantial dose reduction. Drawbacks of PET/MR are a substantially longer imaging time and a slight inferiority in detecting bone and lymph node metastases in patients with PSA values >2 ng/ml. Thus, we suggest the use of 11C-choline PET/MR especially for patients with low (≤2 ng/ml) PSA values, whereas PET/CT is preferable in the subgroup with higher PSA values.""","""['Matthias Eiber', 'Isabel Rauscher', 'Michael Souvatzoglou', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Konstantin Holzapfel', 'Ambros J Beer']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Detection of recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: comparison of 11C-choline PET/CT with pelvic multiparametric MR imaging with endorectal coil.', 'Is there a role for ¹¹C-choline PET/CT in the early detection of metastatic disease in surgically treated prostate cancer patients with a mild PSA increase <1.5 ng/ml?', '(11)C-choline PET/CT and multiparametric MRI in patients with biochemical relapse of prostate cancer.', 'PET/CT with (11)C-choline for evaluation of prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence: meta-analysis and critical review of available data.', 'Acquisition with (11)C-choline and (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT for patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Targeting Local Recurrence After Surgery With MRI Imaging for Prostate Cancer in the Setting of Salvage Radiation Therapy.', 'A decade of multi-modality PET and MR imaging in abdominal oncology.', 'Value of PET imaging for radiation therapy.', 'Comparison of MRI, PET, and 18F-choline PET/MRI in patients with oligometastatic recurrent prostate cancer.']"""

Subsequently, the prepared echinoidea-shaped nanocomposites (Au@Ag-Cu2O) composed of Au@Ag core-shell nanoparticles and disordered cuprous oxide were prepared successfully to label the secondary antibodies (Ab2), which convened the advantages of good biocompatibility and high specific surface area. Because of the synergetic effect present in Au, Ag and Cu2O, the novel nanocomposites exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for the amplified detection of PSA. Therefore, the as-proposed immunosensor for the detection of PSA possessed wide dynamic range from 0.01pg/mL to 100ng/mL with a low detection limit of 0.003pg/mL (S/N = 3).

They are associated with mutations and/or haplo-insufficiencies of ribosomal proteins (RPs) and inefficient ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing. The resulting ribosomal stress induces the canonical p19ARF/Mdm2/p53 tumor suppressor pathway leading to proliferative arrest and/or apoptosis. It has been proposed that this pathway is then inactivated during subsequent neoplastic evolution. We show here that two murine models of hepatoblastoma (HB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) unexpectedly possess features that mimic the ribosomopathies. These include loss of the normal stoichiometry of RP transcripts and proteins and the accumulation of unprocessed rRNA precursors. Silencing of p19ARF, cytoplasmic sequestration of p53, binding to and inactivation of Mdm2 by free RPs, and up-regulation of the pro-survival protein Bcl-2 may further cooperate to drive tumor growth and survival. Consistent with this notion, re-instatement of constitutive p19ARF expression in the HB model completely suppressed tumorigenesis. In >2000 cases of human HCC, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, RP transcript deregulation was a frequent finding. In HCC and breast cancer, the severity of this dysregulation was associated with inferior survival. In HCC, the presence of RP gene mutations, some of which were identical to those previously reported in ribosomopathies, were similarly negatively correlated with long-term survival. Taken together, our results indicate that many if not all cancers possess ribosomopathy-like features that may affect their biological behaviors.""","""['Sucheta Kulkarni', 'James M Dolezal', 'Huabo Wang', 'Laura Jackson', 'Jie Lu', 'Brian P Frodey', 'Atinuke Dosunmu-Ogunbi', 'Youjun Li', 'Marc Fromherz', 'Audry Kang', 'Lucas Santana-Santos', 'Panayiotis V Benos', 'Edward V Prochownik']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Disruption of the RP-MDM2-p53 pathway accelerates APC loss-induced colorectal tumorigenesis.', 'Oncogenic c-Myc-induced lymphomagenesis is inhibited non-redundantly by the p19Arf-Mdm2-p53 and RP-Mdm2-p53 pathways.', 'Ribosomopathies: how a common root can cause a tree of pathologies.', 'In Vivo Senescence in the Sbds-Deficient Murine Pancreas: Cell-Type Specific Consequences of Translation Insufficiency.', 'MDM2-p53 pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'A disease associated mutant reveals how Ltv1 orchestrates RP assembly and rRNA folding of the small ribosomal subunit head.', 'Early events marking lung fibroblast transition to profibrotic state in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.', 'Quality control ensures fidelity in ribosome assembly and cellular health.', 'The promises and pitfalls of specialized ribosomes.', 'The chaperone Tsr2 regulates Rps26 release and reincorporation from mature ribosomes to enable a reversible, ribosome-mediated response to stress.']"""

Material and methods:   Seven-eight patients were treated with SBRT for isolated body metastasis. The most frequent primary tumor was prostate cancer (28.2%), followed by colorectal cancer (23.1%) and lung cancer (20.5%). Median age at diagnosis of oligometastatic disease was 70 years (range 47-88). Median Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) was 90 (range 70-100). The most common SBRT fractionation scheme was 5 × 7 Gy (total dose 35 Gy). Response to radiotherapy was determined according to RECIST criteria v1.1. Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. The survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. The correlation between time actuarial incidence and clinical parameters was studied, and the Kaplan-Meier method of log-rank test was applied.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 22.68 months, local control was achieved in 89.7% of the cases. The two-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 68% and 42%, respectively. On univariate analysis, KPS ≥80 is predictive for improved OS (p = .001) and PFS (p = .001).

Internalisation of EVs can prompt functional changes in the recipient cells, the nature of which depends on the molecular composition and the cargo of the EVs. We hypothesised that the metastatic stage of cancerous parent cells would determine the uptake efficacy and the subsequent functional effects of the respective cancer cell-derived EVs. To address this question, we compared the internalisation of EVs derived from two metastatic site-derived prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP), human telomerase reverse transcriptase immortalised primary malignant prostate epithelial cells (RC92a/hTERT), and a benign epithelial prostate cell line (PNT2). EVs isolated from the metastatic site-derived PC-3 and LNCaP cells were more efficiently internalised by the PC-3 and PNT2 cells compared to the EVs from the primary malignant RC92a/hTERT cells or the benign PNT2 cells, as determined by high content microscopy, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. EV uptake was also influenced by the phase of the cell cycle, so that an increased EV-derived fluorescence signal was observed in the cells at the G2/M phase compared to the G0/G1 or S phases. Finally, differences were also observed in the functions of the recipient cells based on the EV source. Proliferation of PNT2 cells and to a lesser extent also PC-3 cells was enhanced particularly by the EVs from the metastatic-site-derived prostate cancer cells in comparison to the EVs from the benign cells or primary cancer cells, whereas migration of PC-3 cells was enhanced by all cancerous EVs.

The peptidylarginine deiminase PADI2 has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. Here we show that PADI2 is an androgen-repressed gene and is upregulated in CRPC. PADI2 expression was required for survival and cell-cycle progression of prostate cancer cells, and PADI2 promoted proliferation of prostate cancer cells under androgen-deprived or castration conditions in vitro and in vivo Cytoplasmic PADI2 protected the androgen receptor (AR) against proteasome-mediated degradation and facilitated AR binding to its target genes after nuclear translocation and citrullination of histone H3 amino acid residue R26. In contrast, mutant PADI2 D180A failed to affect AR stability, nuclear translocation, or transcriptional activity. PADI2 mediated AR control in a manner dependent on its enzymatic activity and nuclear localization, as correlated with increased histone H3 citrullination. Notably, coadministration of the PADI inhibitor Cl-Amidine and the AR signaling inhibitor enzalutamide synergized in inhibiting CRPC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo Overall, our results establish PADI2 as a key mediator for AR in prostate cancer progression, especially CRPC, and they suggest PADI as novel therapeutic targets in this disease setting.

Materials and methods:   A total of 16,720 men underwent radical prostatectomy and 2,699 experienced biochemical recurrence. We determined predictors of delayed biochemical recurrence as well as metastasis-free and cancer specific survival rates for recurrence at various time points after radical prostatectomy. We performed subset analysis of the 732 men with 20 or more years of recurrence-free followup. Cumulative incidence curves for metastasis and prostate cancer death were calculated and stratified by biochemical recurrence time points.  Results:   Predictors of delayed biochemical recurrence included elevated prostate specific antigen at radical prostatectomy, higher clinical and pathological stage, and positive surgical margins. Delayed biochemical recurrence was associated with favorable cumulative incidence curves for metastasis and prostate cancer death compared to early biochemical recurrence. Among the 732 men with undetectable prostate specific antigen at 20 years biochemical recurrence developed in 17 (2.3%), metastatic disease developed in a single patient and none died of prostate cancer. The actuarial probability of biochemical recurrence among men with undetectable prostate specific antigen at 20 years increased with adverse pathological features.  Conclusions:   Men with delayed biochemical recurrence have favorable clinical features and improved survival. Men with undetectable prostate specific antigen 20 years after radical prostatectomy had a low rate of recurrence and no deaths from prostate cancer.

Objective:   To develop a practical and robust liquid profiling approach for direct quantification of AR-V7 in peripheral whole blood without the need for CTC capture and to determine its potential for predicting treatment response in mCRPC patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   Whole blood samples from a prospective biorepository of 85 mCRPC patients before treatment initiation with abiraterone (n=56) or enzalutamide (n=29) were analyzed via droplet digital polymerase chain reaction.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The association of AR-V7 status with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response defined by PSA decline ≥50% and with PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), clinical PFS, and overall survival (OS) was assessed.  Results and limitations:   High AR-V7 expression levels in whole blood were detectable in 18% (15/85) of patients. No patient with high AR-V7 expression achieved a PSA response, and AR-V7 status was an independent predictor of PSA response in multivariable logistic regression analysis (p=0.03). High AR-V7 expression was associated with shorter PSA-PFS (median 2.4 vs 3.7 mo; p<0.001), shorter clinical PFS (median 2.7 vs 5.5 mo; p<0.001), and shorter OS (median 4.0 vs. 13.9 mo; p<0.001). On multivariable Cox regression analysis, high AR-V7 expression remained an independent predictor of shorter PSA-PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 7.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-20.7; p<0.001), shorter clinical PFS (HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.9; p=0.02), and shorter OS (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4-6.3; p=0.005).

Results:   The authors identified 279,719 pairs of patients with cancer and matched control patients. The 6-month cumulative incidence of arterial thromboembolism was 4.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.6% to 4.8%) in patients with cancer compared with 2.2% (95% CI: 2.1% to 2.2%) in control patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.2; 95% CI: 2.1 to 2.3). The 6-month cumulative incidence of myocardial infarction was 2.0% (95% CI: 1.9% to 2.0%) in patients with cancer compared with 0.7% (95% CI: 0.6% to 0.7%) in control patients (HR: 2.9; 95% CI: 2.8 to 3.1). The 6-month cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was 3.0% (95% CI: 2.9% to 3.1%) in patients with cancer compared with 1.6% (95% CI: 1.6% to 1.7%) in control patients (HR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.8 to 2.0). Excess risk varied by cancer type (greatest for lung), correlated with cancer stage, and generally had resolved by 1 year.

One potential drawback of this method are severe photopenic (halo-) artifacts surrounding the bladder and the kidneys in the scatter-corrected PET images, which have been reported to occur frequently in clinical practice. The goal of this work was to investigate the occurrence and impact of these artifacts and, secondly, to evaluate variants of the standard scatter correction method with regard to halo-artifact suppression.  Methods:   Experiments using a dedicated pelvis phantom were conducted to investigate whether the halo-artifact is modality-, tracer-, and/or concentration-dependent. Furthermore, 31 patients with history of prostate cancer were selected from an ongoing 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI study. For each patient, PET raw data were reconstructed employing six different variants of PET scatter correction: absolute scatter scaling, relative scatter scaling, and relative scatter scaling combined with prompt gamma correction, each of which was combined with a maximum scatter fraction (MaxSF) of MaxSF = 75% or MaxSF = 40%. Evaluation of the reconstructed images with regard to halo-artifact suppression was performed both quantitatively using statistical analysis and qualitatively by two independent readers.  Results:   The phantom experiments did not reveal any modality-dependency (PET/MRI vs. PET/CT) or tracer-dependency (68Ga vs. 18F-FDG). Patient- and phantom-based data indicated that halo-artifacts derive from high organ-to-background activity ratios (OBR) between bladder/kidneys and surrounding soft tissue, with a positive correlation between OBR and halo size. Comparing different variants of scatter correction, reducing the maximum scatter fraction from the default value MaxSF = 75% to MaxSF = 40% was found to efficiently suppress halo-artifacts in both phantom and patient data. In 1 of 31 patients, reducing the maximum scatter fraction provided new PET-based information changing the patient's diagnosis.  Conclusion:   Halo-artifacts are particularly observed for 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI due to 1) the biodistribution of the PSMA-11-tracer resulting in large OBRs for bladder and kidneys and 2) inaccurate scatter correction methods currently used in clinical routine, which tend to overestimate the scatter contribution. If not compensated for, 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake pathologies may be masked by halo-artifacts leading to false-negative diagnoses.

Though KLK14 functioning in cancer is poorly understood, it has been implicated in HGF/Met signaling, given that KLK14 proteolytically inhibits HGF activator-inhibitor 1 (HAI-1), which strongly inhibits pro-HGF activators, thereby contributing to tumor progression. In this work, KLK14 binding to either hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type-1 (HAI-1) or type-2 (HAI-2) was essayed using homology modeling, molecular dynamic simulations and free-energy calculations through MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA. KLK14 was successfully modeled. Calculated free energies suggested higher binding affinity for the KLK14/HAI-1 interaction than for KLK14/HAI-2. This difference in binding affinity is largely explained by the higher stability of the hydrogen-bond networks in KLK14/HAI-1 along the simulation trajectory. A key arginine residue in both HAI-1 and HAI-2 is responsible for their interaction with the S1 pocket in KLK14.

Methods:   A total of 185 patients with prostate cancer who had received ADT as the primary therapy in Department of Urology of Peking University First Hospital from 2003 to 2014 were enrolled retrospectively. All the patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer via prostate biopsy and followed up every four weeks from the initiation of ADT. All the patients received ADT with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (LHRH-A) or surgical castration accompanied with an antiandrogen (bicalutamide or flutamide, combined androgen blockade). The clinical information of the patients were collected including age, clinical TNM stage, Gleason score (GS), risk groups of prostate cancer, PSA at the initiation of ADT, PSA nadir after ADT, PSA decline velocity, and the time to PSA nadir. The end point of this study was the diagnosis of CRPC, which was based on the European Association of Urology (EAU) Guideline 2016. Cox proportional hazards regression models were established to analyze and estimate their effects on the time of progression to CRPC.  Results:   In this study, 185 patients with prostate cancer who had received ADT as the primary therapy were included. The mean age was (71.02±8.67) years. The median time to progression to CRPC in this cohort was 38 months (ranging from 4 to 158 months). On univariate analysis, we found clinical T stage, N stage, the metastasis state before ADT, risk groups of prostate cancer, PSA decline velocity, and PSA nadir were all related to the time to CRPC progression, P<0.01 for all the above variables.

Methods:   Different gradient concentrations of RM-1 cells were inoculated into the cavity of left femoral bone or lumbar vertebra of mice (C57BL/6) respectively. The change of mouse activity, tumor formation, tumor size and survival time were observed respectively. And the femur tissue and spinal tissue were obtained from the mice after death. The gray value of iconography were measured by imageological examination of femur tissue, and the final histopathological examination were taken to determine the tumor type in both femur and spinal tissue.  Results:   The tumor growth could be touched at the puncture site in all the mice after inoculated for 7 days. There were no obvious differences in the time of tumorigenesis, the rate of tumor growth and tumor size among the mice in the same group (P>0.05).

Fluorescence microscopy, Western blot and immunoprecipitation were used to detect NESAR regulation of androgen receptor stability.  Results:   Under the fluorescence microscope, NESAR-containing fusion proteins were cytoplasmic localization, and their fluorescence intensities were much weaker than those without NESAR. The expression levels of NESAR-containing fusion proteins were significantly lower than those without NESAR. The half-lives of GFP-NESAR and GFP-NAR-NESAR were less than 6 h, while the expression of GFP and GFP-NAR was relatively stable and the half-life was more than 24 h in the presence of cycloheximide. The expression levels of GFP-NESAR were significantly increased by proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment in a dose-dependent manner; in contrast, MG132 did not show any significant effect on the protein levels of GFP. When new protein synthesis was blocked, MG132 could also prevent the degradation of GFP-NESAR in the transfected cells in the presence of cycloheximide, while it had no significant effect on GFP protein stability in the parallel experiment. GFP immunoprecipitation showed that the ubiquitination level of GFP-NESAR fusion protein was significantly higher than that of the GFP control. The mutations of lysine sites K776 and K807 in NESAR significantly reduced the level of ubiquitination, and showed increased protein stability, indicating that they were the key amino acid residues of NESAR ubiquitination.  Conclusion:   NESAR was unstable and decreased the stability of its fusion proteins. NESAR was the target of polyubiquitination and mediated the degradation of its fusion proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in prostate cancer cells. Our research provides a new way to regulate the level and/or activity of AR proteins, thus helping us understand the molecular mechanisms of AR degradation and strict control of AR in the progression to castration-resistance.""","""['Y Q Gong', 'C J Zhang', 'S M He', 'X S Li', 'L Q Zhou', 'Y L Guo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['Nuclear export signal of androgen receptor (NESAR) regulation of androgen receptor level in human prostate cell lines via ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation.', 'Splicing Factor Prp8 Interacts With NES(AR) and Regulates Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'High-Content Screening Identifies Src Family Kinases as Potential Regulators of AR-V7 Expression and Androgen-Independent Cell Growth.', 'Regulatory processes affecting androgen receptor expression, stability, and function: potential targets to treat hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor and vitamin D agonist are involved in suppressing invasive phenotype of prostate cancer cells.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between 1992 and 1997, 104 men with cT2-3, surgically staged node-negative prostate cancer were randomized to receive either EBRT (40 Gy/20 fractions) with iridium implant (35 Gy/48 hours) or EBRT alone (66 Gy/33 fractions) to the prostate. According to T stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen level, 60% of patients had high-risk disease. Substantial improvements in biochemical control at 8 years have previously been reported. Additional follow-up was collected on deaths and metastases.  Results:   Median follow-up was 14 years. Five patients were lost to follow-up. All other patients have been followed a minimum of 13 years. There have been 75 deaths, including 21 from prostate cancer and 25 from second cancers. No patients developing a second cancer have died from prostate cancer. There was no difference in overall survival between the 2 treatment groups: 34 deaths (67%) in the implant arm and 41 (77%) in the EBRT arm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-1.59). Similarly, there was no difference in prostate cancer-specific deaths: 9 (18%) patients in the implant arm compared with 12 (23%) in the EBRT arm (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.34-1.87). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients developing metastatic disease: 10 (20%) in the implant arm and 15 (28%) in the EBRT arm (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.32-1.57). Improvements in biochemical control were maintained (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.88).  Conclusions:   Despite a dramatic reduction of biochemical recurrence rates, the addition of iridium implant to EBRT did not translate into improved overall survival or prostate cancer-specific survival.""","""['Ian S Dayes', 'Sameer Parpia', 'Jaclyn Gilbert', 'Jim A Julian', 'Ian R Davis', 'Mark N Levine', 'Jinka Sathya']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Randomized trial comparing iridium implant plus external-beam radiation therapy with external-beam radiation therapy alone in node-negative locally advanced cancer of the prostate.', 'Androgen Suppression Combined with Elective Nodal and Dose Escalated Radiation Therapy (the ASCENDE-RT Trial): An Analysis of Survival Endpoints for a Randomized Trial Comparing a\xa0Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Boost to a\xa0Dose-Escalated External Beam Boost for High- and Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical results of combined treatment conformal high-dose-rate iridium-192 brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy using staging lymphadenectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Combination of brachytherapy and external beam radiation for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'External radiation therapy and transcatheter iridium in the treatment of extrahepatic bile duct carcinoma.', 'Virtual HDR Boost for Prostate Cancer: Rebooting a Classic Treatment Using Modern Tech.', 'Comparison of four-year toxicities and local control of ultra-hypofractionated vs moderate-hypofractionated image guided prostate radiation with HDR brachytherapy boost: A phase I-II single institution trial.', 'Does brachytherapy boost improve survival outcomes in Gleason Grade Group 5 patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy?

However, depending on risk factors, 40-70% of the patients experience further progression. With a focus on the pre- and post-SRT serum level of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), we assessed the determinants of the long-term outcome after SRT.  Patient and methods:   Between 1997 and 2011, 464 patients received 3D-conformal SRT with median 66.6 Gy. The median PSA level before SRT was 0.31 ng/ml. In our retrospective analysis, post-SRT progression was defined as either a rising PSA >0.2 ng/ml above the nadir, or the application of anti-androgens or clinical recurrence. A PSA <0.1 ng/ml was termed undetectable. We analyzed the data with the Kaplan-Meier method (Logrank test) and multivariable Cox regression.  Results:   The median follow-up was 5.9 years. Overall, 178 patients had recurrence, 13 developed distant metastases and 30 died. Univariate, a pre-RP PSA <10 ng/ml, pathological stage pT <3, Gleason score <8, positive surgical margins, a pre-SRT PSA <0.2 ng/ml and a post-SRT PSA nadir <0.1 ng/ml correlated with fewer and later second recurrences. In a multivariable Cox model, pT, Gleason score, margin status and pre-SRT PSA were significant covariates of progression. If the post-SRT PSA response was included in the regression analysis, then a nadir ≥0.1 ng/ml was the strongest risk factor. Initiating SRT at a PSA <0.2 ng/ml correlated with a post-SRT PSA <0.1 ng/ml. Men who achieved an undetectable post-SRT PSA nadir also had lower rates of metastases and a better overall survival. However, there were too few events for Cox regression analysis of these two endpoints.  Conclusions:   Early SRT at a PSA <0.2 ng/ml correlates with re-achieving an undetectable PSA, which predicts improved freedom from progression and metastases and better overall survival.""","""['Detlef Bartkowiak', 'Reinhard Thamm', 'Dirk Bottke', 'Alessandra Siegmann', 'Dirk Böhmer', 'Volker Budach', 'Thomas Wiegel']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['The PSA-response to salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy correlates with freedom from progression and overall survival.', 'Effect of early salvage radiotherapy at PSA\u2009<\u20090.5\u2009ng/ml and impact of post-SRT PSA nadir in post-prostatectomy recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Defining biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and timing of early salvage radiotherapy : Informing the debate.', 'Adjuvant vs. salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: clinical outcomes and factors influencing biochemical recurrence.', 'Postoperative Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer: Adjuvant versus Early Salvage.', 'Impact of Dose Escalation on the Efficacy of Salvage Radiotherapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer-A Risk-Adjusted, Matched-Pair Analysis.', 'RADIOTHERAPY OF PROSTATE CANCER: PRIMARY RADIOTHERAPY AND RADIOTHERAPY IN DISEASE RELAPSE.', 'A Multi-Institutional Analysis of Prostate Cancer Patients With or Without 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Prior to Salvage Radiotherapy of the Prostatic Fossa.']"""

Direct visual comparison of PET/CT slices to whole prostate sections is hampered by considerable uncertainties from imperfect coregistration and fundamentally different image modalities. In the current study, we present a novel method for advanced voxel-wise comparison of histopathology from excised prostates to pre-surgical PET. Resected prostates from eight patients who underwent PSMA-PET/CT were scanned (ex vivo CT) and thoroughly pathologically prepared. In vivo and ex vivo CT including histopathology were coregistered with three different methods (manual, semi-/automatic). Spatial overlap after CT-based registration was evaluated with dice similarity (DSC). Furthermore, we constructed 3D cancer distribution models from histopathologic information in various slices. Subsequent smoothing reflected the intrinsically limited spatial resolution of PSMA-PET. The resulting histoPET models were used for quantitative analysis of spatial histopathology-PET pattern agreement focusing on p values and coefficients of determination (R 2). We examined additional rigid mutual information (MI) coregistration directly based on PSMA-PET and histoPET.  Results:   Mean DSC for the three different methods (ManReg, ScalFactReg, and DefReg) were 0.79 ± 0.06, 0.82 ± 0.04, and 0.90 ± 0.02, respectively, while quantification of PET-histopathology pattern agreement after CT-based registration revealed R 2 45.7, 43.2, and 41.3% on average with p < 10-5. Subsequent PET-based MI coregistration yielded R 2 61.3, 55.9, and 55.6%, respectively, while implying anatomically plausible transformations.  Conclusions:   Creating 3D histoPET models based on thorough histopathological preparation allowed sophisticated quantitative analyses showing highly significant correlations between histopathology and (PSMA-)PET.

The expression patterns and role of SCAI during physiological and pathophysiological processes is still poorly understood. Earlier we demonstrated that SCAI is regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of proximal tubular epithelial cells, it is downregulated during renal fibrosis and it is overexpressed in Wilms' tumors. Here we bring further evidence for the involvement of SCAI during cell plasticity and we examine the prognostic value and expression patterns of SCAI in various tumors. SCAI prevented the activation of the SMA promoter induced by angiotensin II. SCAI expression decreased in a model of endothelial-mesenchymal transition and increased during iPS reprogramming of fibroblasts. During renal fibrosis SCAI expression declined, as evidenced in a rat model of renal transplant rejection and in TGF-β1 overexpressing transgenic mice. High expression of SCAI correlated with better survival in patients with breast and lung cancers. Intriguingly, in the case of other cancers (gastric, prostate, colorectal) high SCAI expression correlated with poor survival of patients.

Based on translational research, this perspective article provides a novel mechanistic link between milk intake and milk miRNA-regulated gene expression of the transcription factor p53 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), two guardians of the human genome, that control transcriptional activity, cell survival, and apoptosis. Major miRNAs of milk, especially miRNA-125b, directly target TP53 and complex p53-dependent gene regulatory networks. TP53 regulates the expression of key genes involved in cell homeostasis such as FOXO1, PTEN, SESN1, SESN2, AR, IGF1R, BAK1, BIRC5, and TNFSF10. Nuclear interaction of p53 with DNMT1 controls gene silencing. The most abundant miRNA of milk and milk fat, miRNA-148a, directly targets DNMT1. Reduced DNMT1 expression further attenuates the activity of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and access to transcription. The presented milk-mediated miRNA-p53-DNMT1 pathway exemplified at the promoter regulation of survivin (BIRC5) provides a novel explanation for the epidemiological association between milk consumption and acne vulgaris and prostate cancer. Notably, p53- and DNMT1-targeting miRNAs of bovine and human milk survive pasteurization and share identical seed sequences, which theoretically allows the interaction of bovine miRNAs with the human genome. Persistent intake of milk-derived miRNAs that attenuate p53- and DNMT1 signaling of the human milk consumer may thus present an overlooked risk factor promoting acne vulgaris, prostate cancer, and other p53/DNMT1-related Western diseases. Therefore, bioactive miRNAs of commercial milk should be eliminated from the human food chain.""","""['Bodo C Melnik']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nutr Metab (Lond)""","""['Milk: an epigenetic amplifier of FTO-mediated transcription?

Secretion of exosomes and metalloproteases is essential for extracellular matrix remodeling, enabling migration through tissue barriers. Metastatic prostate cancer is differentiated by expression of the rare isoform A of the molecular motor myosin IC, however the function of this isoform remained unknown. Here we show that it contributes causatively to the invasive motility of prostate cancer cells. We found that the isoform associates with metalloprotease-containing exosomes and stimulates their secretion. While the data show that myosin IC is involved in prostate cancer cell migration, migration outside extracellular matrix in vitro proves little affected specifically by isoform A. Nevertheless, this isoform stimulates invasion through extracellular matrix, pointing to a critical role in secretion. Both the secretion and invasion depend on the integrity of the motor and lipid-binding domains of the protein. Our results demonstrate how myosin IC isoform A is likely to function in metastasis, driving secretion of exosomes that enable invasion of prostate cancer cells across extracellular matrix barriers.

Here, the mechanism by which NE regulates prostate cancer DTCs in the marrow is explored. NE directly stimulated prostate cancer cell proliferation through β2-adrenergic receptors (ADRB2). NE also altered prostate cancer proliferation in the marrow niche by indirectly downregulating the secretion of the dormancy inducing molecule growth arrest specific-6 (GAS6) expressed by osteoblasts. These observations were confirmed in cocultures of prostate cancer cells expressing the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell-cycle reporters (FUCCI) and osteoblasts isolated from GAS6-deficient (GAS6-/-) animals. A novel ex vivo model system, using femurs harvested from GAS6+/+ or GAS6-/- mice, was used to confirm these results. As in coculture, when prostate cancer cells were injected into the marrow cavities of GAS6+/+ femurs, NE altered the prostate cancer cell cycle. However, NE had less of an impact on prostate cancer cells in femur explants isolated from GAS6-/- mice. Together, this study demonstrates that NE reactivates prostate cancer cell cycling through both a direct action on prostate cancer cells and indirectly on adjacent niche cells.Implications: Identification of mechanisms that target DTCs may provide novel therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat cancer metastases more effectively.

Methods:   Cohort study where ionizing radiation dose of cosmic radiation was estimated from airline data and software program and cancer incidence was obtained by record linkage with nation-wide cancer registry. All licenced commercial male airline pilots were followed from 1955 to 2015, ever or never employed at airline with international routes. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated and relative risk by Poisson regression, to examine exposure-response relation.  Results:   Eighty three cancers were registered compared with 92 expected; standardized incidence ratios were 0.90 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.11) for all cancers, 3.31 (95% CI 1.33 to 6.81) for malignant melanoma, and 2.49 (95% CI 1.69 to 3.54), for basal cell carcinoma of skin. The risk for all cancers, malignant melanoma, prostate cancer, basal cell carcinoma of skin, and basal cell carcinoma of trunk increased with an increase in number of employment years, cumulative air hours, total cumulative radiation dose, and cumulative radiation dose sustained up to age of 40 years. The relative risk for the highest exposure categories of cumulative radiation dose were 2.42 (95% CI 1.50 to 3.92) for all cancers, 2.57 (95% CI 1.18 to 5.56) for prostate cancer, 9.88 (95% CI 1.57 to 190.78) for malignant melanoma, 3.61 (95% CI 1.64 to 8.48) for all basal cell carcinoma, and 6.65 (95% CI 1.61 to 44.64) for basal cell carcinoma of trunk.  Conclusions:   This study was underpowered to study brain cancer and leukaemia risk. Basal cell carcinoma of skin is radiation-related cancer, and may be attributed to cosmic radiation.

Achillea wilhelmsii (AW) is a plant that has been traditionally used for its medicinal properties. The aim of current study was to evaluate the effects of AW extract on a PCa cell line. The cytotoxic activity of the hydroalcoholic extract of AW was studied on the PCa PC3 cell line using MTT assay. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the effects of the extract on the apoptosis. The expression of hTERT mRNA was analyzed by the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. The ELISA method was used to measure the levels of telomerase enzyme. The hydroalcoholic AW extract demonstrated the appropriate inhibitory effect in 150 µg/ml concentration (IC50) on PC3 cell line following 48 h treatment. Treatment of the PC3 cells with AW resulted in a significant increase in early and late apoptotic cells and a decrease in live cells (P<0.001), in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the early apoptotic cells were significantly higher than late apoptotic cells. The hTERT mRNA expression was decreased following 24 h treatment of AW extract, although it was not different between 2, 4, 8 and 12 h treatments or 24, 48 and 72 h treatments. In addition, the hTERT concentration was significantly decreased following 24 h treatment of AW extract with the marginal P-value. There was no significant difference regarding hTERT concentration between 2, 4, 8 and 12 h treatments or 24, 48 and 72 h treatments. The hydroalcoholic extract of AW induced potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in PC3 cell line, which could be explainable by its high potency to inhibit expression of the prominent oncogene hTERT in PCa. Therefore, targeting telomerase represents a promising strategy for PCa therapy, and AW may have considerable potential for development as a novel natural anticancer agent.""","""['Mojtaba Ashtiani', 'Fariba Nabatchian', 'Hamid Reza Galavi', 'Ramin Saravani', 'Farzaneh Farajian-Mashhadi', 'Saeedeh Salimi']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biomed Rep""","""['Inhibition of telomerase with human telomerase reverse transcriptase antisense increases the sensitivity of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'The herbal medicine Melissa officinalis extract effects on gene expression of p53, Bcl-2, Her2, VEGF-A and hTERT in human lung, breast and prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Inhibition of telomerase with human telomerase reverse transcriptase antisense enhances tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells.', 'Therapeutic effects of hydro-alcoholic extract of Achillea wilhelmsii C.

Here, we demonstrate that LSD1 regulates vitamin D receptor (VDR) activity and is a mediator of 1,25(OH)2-D3 (vitamin D) action in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   Athymic nude mice were xenografted with CWR22 cells and monitored weekly after testosterone pellet removal. Expression of LSD1 and VDR (IHC) were correlated with tumor growth using log-rank test. TRAMP tumors and prostates from wild-type (WT) mice were used to evaluate VDR and LSD1 expression via IHC and western blotting. The presence of VDR and LSD1 in the same transcriptional complex was evaluated via immunoprecipitation (IP) using nuclear cell lysate. The effect of LSD1 and 1,25(OH)2-D3 on cell viability was evaluated in C4-2 and BC1A cells via trypan blue exclusion. The role of LSD1 in VDR-mediated gene transcription was evaluated for Cdkn1a, E2f1, Cyp24a1, and S100g via qRT-PCR-TaqMan and via chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Methylation of Cdkn1a TSS was measured via bisulfite sequencing, and methylation of a panel of cancer-related genes was quantified using methyl arrays. The Cancer Genome Atlas data were retrieved to identify genes whose status correlates with LSD1 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). Results were correlated with patients' survival data from two separate cohorts of primary and metastatic PCa.  Results:   LSD1 and VDR protein levels are elevated in PCa tumors and correlate with faster tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Knockdown of LSD1 reduces PCa cell viability, and gene expression data suggest a dual coregulatory role of LSD1 for VDR, acting as a coactivator and corepressor in a locus-specific manner. LSD1 modulates VDR-dependent transcription by mediating the recruitment of VDR and DNMT1 at the TSS of VDR-targeted genes and modulates the epigenetic status of transcribed genes by altering H3K4me2 and H3K9Ac and DNA methylation. Lastly, LSD1 and DNMT1 belong to a genome-wide signature whose expression correlates with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival in primary and metastatic patients' samples, respectively.  Conclusions:   Results demonstrate that LSD1 has a dual coregulatory role as corepressor and coactivator for VDR and defines a genomic signature whose targeting might have clinical relevance for PCa patients.""","""['Sebastiano Battaglia', 'Ellen Karasik', 'Bryan Gillard', 'Jennifer Williams', 'Trisha Winchester', 'Michael T Moser', 'Dominic J Smiraglia', 'Barbara A Foster']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['Recruitment of NCOR1 to VDR target genes is enhanced in prostate cancer cells and associates with altered DNA methylation patterns.', 'Loss of LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1) suppresses growth and alters gene expression of human colon cancer cells in a p53- and DNMT1(DNA methyltransferase 1)-independent manner.', 'Phosphorylation of histone H3T6 by PKCbeta(I) controls demethylation at histone H3K4.', 'Vitamin D in Prostate Cancer.', 'The vitamin D hormone and its nuclear receptor: molecular actions and disease states.', 'Vitamin D in Neurological Diseases.', 'DNA methyltransferase 1 knockdown reverses PTEN and VDR by mediating demethylation of promoter and protects against renal injuries in hepatitis B virus-associated glomerulonephritis.', 'Vitamin D and Its Target Genes.', 'The ERRα-VDR axis promotes calcitriol degradation and estrogen signaling in breast cancer cells, while VDR-CYP24A1-ERRα overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in patients with basal-like breast cancer.', 'Histone lysine specific demethylase 1 inhibitors.']"""

The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential role of human papilloma viruses (HPVs) in prostate cancer. The aims are (i) to investigate the presence and confirm the identity of high risk HPVs in benign prostate tissues prior to the development of HPV positive prostate cancer in the same patients, and (ii) to determine if HPVs are biologically active.  Methods:   We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify HPVs in specimens from 52 Australian men with benign prostate biopsies who 1 to 10 years later developed prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to assess the expression of HPV E7 oncoproteins, cytokeratin and prostate specific antigen (PSA). We used RNASeq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify possible HPV RNA sequences in prostate cancer.  Results:   HPV screening using standard PCR was conducted on 28 of the 52 sets of benign and later prostate cancers. HPV L1 genes were identified in 13 (46%) benign and 8 (29%) of 28 later prostate cancers in the same patients. HPV E7 genes were identified in 23 (82%) benign and 19 (68%) of 28 subsequent prostate cancers in the same patients. The same HPV types were present in both the benign and subsequent prostate cancers in 9 sets of specimens. HPV type 16 was identified in 15% of benign and 3% of prostate cancers. HPV type 18 was identified in 26% of benign and 16% of prostate cancers. Small numbers of HPV types 45, 47, 76 and 115 were also identified. High confidence RNA-Seq evidence for high risk HPV types 16 and 18 was identified in 12 (2%) of the 502 TCGA prostate cancer transcriptomes. High risk HPV E7 oncoprotein was positively expressed in 23 (82%) of 28 benign prostate specimens but only in 8 (29%) of 28 of the later prostate cancer specimens. This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.001). Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was more highly expressed in 26 (50%) of 52 prostate cancer specimens as compared to prior benign prostate specimens in the same patients.  Conclusions:   High risk HPVs are present in benign prostate tissues prior to the development of HPV positive prostate cancer. There is a significantly higher expression of HPV E7 oncoproteins in benign prostate tissues as compared to late prostate cancer that subsequently developed in the same patients. This observation suggests that HPV oncogenic activity is an early phenomenon in a majority of prostate oncogenesis. TCGA RNA-Seq data suggests that HPV is biologically active in some prostate tumour samples.""","""['Wendy K Glenn#', 'Christopher C Ngan#', 'Timothy G Amos', 'Richard J Edwards', 'Joshua Swift', 'Louise Lutze-Mann', 'Fei Shang', 'Noel J Whitaker', 'James S Lawson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Infect Agent Cancer""","""['Human Papilloma Viruses and Breast Cancer.', 'Early Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Oncogenic Influences in Breast Cancer.', 'Human Papilloma Virus Identification in Breast Cancer Patients with Previous Cervical Neoplasia.', 'Evidence for a causal role by human papillomaviruses in prostate cancer - a systematic review.', 'Human Papilloma Viruses and Breast Cancer - Assessment of Causality.', 'Detection of high-risk Human Papillomavirus in prostate cancer from a UK based population.', 'The complexity of human papilloma virus in cancers: a narrative review.', 'Viral tropism for the testis and sexual transmission.', 'Multiple pathogens and prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Microbiota and Prostate Cancer: A New Trend in Treatment.']"""

Design:   The Philadelphia Area Prostate Cancer Access Study (P2 Access) is a mailed, cross-sectional survey of men sampled from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry, combined with neighborhood Census data.  Setting:   Eight counties in southeastern Pennsylvania.  Participants:   2,386 men with prostate adenocarcinoma.  Main measures:   Receipt of definitive treatment, race, self-reported income, education, employment status, and neighborhood SES.  Results:   Overall, Black and White men were equally likely to receive definitive treatment. Men living in neighborhoods with higher SES were more likely to receive definitive treatment (OR 1.57, 95%CI 1.01, 2.42). Among men who received definitive treatment, Black men were significantly less likely to receive radical prostatectomy compared with White men (OR .71, 95% CI .52, .98), as were men with some college education compared with those with a high school education or less (OR .66, 95% CI .47, .94). SES does not mediate racial differences in receipt of definitive treatment or the type of definitive treatment received, and associations with income or employment status were not significant.

We identified the type 1, 2, and 4 collagen-binding protein transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-induced protein (TGFBI) as an important factor in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant progression of prostate cancer. In prostate cancer cell lines, AR signaling stimulated the activity of the transcription factor SPDEF, which repressed the expression of TGFBI ADT, AR antagonism, or overexpression of TGFBI inhibited the activity of SPDEF and enhanced the proliferation rates of prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of TGFBI suppressed migration and proliferation in cultured cells and reduced prostate tumor growth and brain and bone metastasis in xenograft models, extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Analysis of prostate tissue samples collected before and after ADT from the same patients showed that ADT reduced the nuclear abundance of SPDEF and increased the production of TGFBI.

Constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) represent a well-established mechanism of therapeutic resistance and disease progression. These variants lack the AR ligand-binding domain and, as such, are not inhibited by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which is the standard systemic approach for advanced prostate cancer. Signaling by AR-Vs, including the clinically relevant AR-V7, is augmented by Vav3, an established AR coactivator in CRPC. Using mutational and biochemical studies, we demonstrated that the Vav3 Diffuse B-cell lymphoma homology (DH) domain interacted with the N-terminal region of AR-V7 (and full length AR). Expression of the Vav3 DH domain disrupted Vav3 interaction with and enhancement of AR-V7 activity. The Vav3 DH domain also disrupted AR-V7 interaction with other AR coactivators: Src1 and Vav2, which are overexpressed in PC. This Vav3 domain was used in proof-of-concept studies to evaluate the effects of disrupting the interaction between AR-V7 and its coactivators on CRPC cells. This disruption decreased CRPC cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, caused increased apoptosis, decreased migration, and resulted in the acquisition of morphological changes associated with a less aggressive phenotype. While disrupting the interaction between FL-AR and its coactivators decreased N-C terminal interaction, disrupting the interaction of AR-V7 with its coactivators decreased AR-V7 nuclear levels.Implications: This study demonstrates the potential therapeutic utility of inhibiting constitutively active AR-V signaling by disrupting coactivator binding. Such an approach is significant, as AR-Vs are emerging as important drivers of CRPC that are particularly recalcitrant to current therapies.

This article provides an updated report of cancer incidence recorded in VACCR.  Materials and methods:   Data were obtained from VACCR for incident cancers diagnosed in the VA health care system, focusing on 2010 data. Cancer incidence among VA patients is described by anatomical site, sex, race, stage, and geographic location, and was compared to the general U.S. cancer population.  Results:   In 2010, among 46,170 invasive cancers, 97% were diagnosed among men. Approximately 80% of newly diagnosed patients were white, 19% black, and less than 2% were other minority races. Median age at diagnosis was 65 years. The three most frequently diagnosed cancers among VA were prostate (29%), lung/bronchus (18%), and colon/rectum (8%). Melanoma and kidney/renal pelvis tied for fourth (4%), and urinary bladder tied for sixth with liver and intrahepatic bile duct (3.4%). Approximately 23% of prostate, 21% of lung/bronchus, and 31% of colon/rectum cancers were diagnosed with Stage I disease. The overall invasive cancer incidence rate among VA users was 505.8 per 100,000 person-years.  Conclusions:   Although the composition of the VA population is shifting and includes a larger number of women, registry data indicate that incident cancers in VA in 2010 were most similar to those observed among U.S. men. Consistent reporting of VACCR data is important to provide accurate estimates of VA cancer incidence.

However, it remains unclear if mutant SPOP proteins can be utilized as biomarkers for early detection, diagnosis, prognosis or targeted therapy of prostate cancer. Moreover, the SPOP mutation sites are distributed in a relatively short region with multiple lysine residues, posing significant challenges for bottom-up proteomics analysis of the SPOP mutations.  Methods:   To address this issue, PRISM (high-pressure, high-resolution separations coupled with intelligent selection and multiplexing)-SRM (selected reaction monitoring) mass spectrometry assays have been developed for quantifying wild-type SPOP protein and 11 prostate cancer-derived SPOP mutations.  Results:   Despite inherent limitations due to amino acid sequence constraints, all the PRISM-SRM assays developed using Arg-C digestion showed a linear dynamic range of at least two orders of magnitude, with limits of quantification ranged from 0.1 to 1 fmol/μg of total protein in the cell lysate. Applying these SRM assays to analyze HEK293T cells with and without expression of the three most frequent SPOP mutations in prostate cancer (Y87N, F102C or F133V) led to confident detection of all three SPOP mutations in corresponding positive cell lines but not in the negative cell lines. Expression of the F133V mutation and wild-type SPOP was at much lower levels compared to that of F102C and Y87N mutations; however, at present, it is unknown if this also affects the biological activity of the SPOP protein.

In the case of prostate treatment, one of the remaining challenges currently holding back the implementation of an RTP workflow is the MR-based localisation of intraprostatic gold fiducial markers (FMs), which is crucial for accurate patient positioning. Currently, MR-based FM localisation is clinically performed manually. This is sub-optimal, as manual interaction increases the workload. Attempts to perform automatic FM detection often rely on being able to detect signal voids induced by the FMs in magnitude images. However, signal voids may not always be sufficiently specific, hampering accurate and robust automatic FM localisation. Here, we present an approach that aims at automatic MR-based FM localisation. This method is based on template matching using a library of simulated complex-valued templates, and exploiting the behaviour of the complex MR signal in the vicinity of the FM. Clinical evaluation was performed on seventeen prostate cancer patients undergoing external beam radiotherapy treatment. Automatic MR-based FM localisation was compared to manual MR-based and semi-automatic CT-based localisation (the current gold standard) in terms of detection rate and the spatial accuracy and precision of localisation. The proposed method correctly detected all three FMs in 15/17 patients. The spatial accuracy (mean) and precision (STD) were 0.9 mm and 0.5 mm respectively, which is below the voxel size of [Formula: see text] mm3 and comparable to MR-based manual localisation. FM localisation failed (3/51 FMs) in the presence of bleeding or calcifications in the direct vicinity of the FM. The method was found to be spatially accurate and precise, which is essential for clinical use. To overcome any missed detection, we envision the use of the proposed method along with verification by an observer. This will result in a semi-automatic workflow facilitating the introduction of an MR-only workflow.""","""['Matteo Maspero', 'Cornelis A T van den Berg', 'Frank Zijlstra', 'Gonda G Sikkes', 'Hans C J de Boer', 'Gert J Meijer', 'Linda G W Kerkmeijer', 'Max A Viergever', 'Jan J W Lagendijk', 'Peter R Seevinck']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Evaluation of gold fiducial marker manual localisation for magnetic resonance-only prostate radiotherapy.', 'Accuracy of an MR-only workflow for prostate radiotherapy using semi-automatically burned-in fiducial markers.', 'MRI-alone radiation therapy planning for prostate cancer: Automatic fiducial marker detection.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Are cone beam CT image matching skills transferrable from planning CT to planning MRI for MR-only prostate radiotherapy?', 'MR-PROTECT: Clinical feasibility of a prostate MRI-only radiotherapy treatment workflow and investigation of acceptance criteria.', 'A Multi-center Prospective Study for Implementation of an MRI-Only Prostate Treatment Planning Workflow.', 'The rationale for MR-only treatment planning for external radiotherapy.', 'Improving fiducial and prostate capsule visualization for radiotherapy planning using MRI.']"""

To establish the feasibility of clinical genomic profiling in the disease, we performed targeted deep sequencing of tumor and normal DNA from patients with locoregional, metastatic non-castrate, and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   Patients consented to genomic analysis of their tumor and germline DNA. A hybridization capture-based clinical assay was employed to identify single nucleotide variations, small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations and structural rearrangements in over 300 cancer-related genes in tumors and matched normal blood.  Results:   We successfully sequenced 504 tumors from 451 patients with prostate cancer. Potentially actionable alterations were identified in DNA damage repair (DDR), PI3K, and MAP kinase pathways. 27% of patients harbored a germline or a somatic alteration in a DDR gene that may predict for response to PARP inhibition. Profiling of matched tumors from individual patients revealed that somatic TP53 and BRCA2 alterations arose early in tumors from patients who eventually developed metastatic disease. In contrast, comparative analysis across disease states revealed that APC alterations were enriched in metastatic tumors, while ATM alterations were specifically enriched in CRPC.  Conclusion:   Through genomic profiling of prostate tumors representing the disease clinical spectrum, we identified a high frequency of potentially actionable alterations and possible drivers of disease initiation, metastasis and castration-resistance.

Optoacoustic tomography (OT) is an emerging clinical imaging modality that provides static images of endogenous haemoglobin concentration and oxygenation. Here, we demonstrate oxygen enhanced (OE)-OT, exploiting an oxygen gas challenge to visualise the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of tumour vascular function. We show that tracking oxygenation dynamics using OE-OT reveals significant differences between two prostate cancer models in nude mice with markedly different vascular function (PC3 & LNCaP), which appear identical in static OT. LNCaP tumours showed a spatially heterogeneous response within and between tumours, with a substantial but slow response to the gas challenge, aligned with ex vivo analysis, which revealed a generally perfused and viable tumour with marked areas of haemorrhage. PC3 tumours had a lower fraction of responding pixels compared to LNCaP with a high disparity between rim and core response. While the PC3 core showed little or no dynamic response, the rim showed a rapid change, consistent with our ex vivo findings of hypoxic and necrotic core tissue surrounded by a rim of mature and perfused vasculature. OE-OT metrics are shown to be highly repeatable and correlate directly on a per-tumour basis to tumour vessel function assessed ex vivo. OE-OT provides a non-invasive approach to reveal the complex dynamics of tumour vessel perfusion, permeability and vasoactivity in real time. Our findings indicate that OE-OT holds potential for application in prostate cancer patients, to improve delineation of aggressive and indolent disease as well as in patient stratification for chemo- and radio-therapy.""","""['Michal R Tomaszewski', 'Isabel Quiros Gonzalez', ""James Pb O'Connor"", 'Oshaani Abeyakoon', 'Geoff Jm Parker', 'Kaye J Williams', 'Fiona J Gilbert', 'Sarah E Bohndiek']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Optoacoustics delineates murine breast cancer models displaying angiogenesis and vascular mimicry.', 'Oxygen-Enhanced and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Optoacoustic Tomography Provide Surrogate Biomarkers of Tumor Vascular Function, Hypoxia, and Necrosis.', 'Simultaneous visualization of tumour oxygenation, neovascularization and contrast agent perfusion by real-time three-dimensional optoacoustic tomography.', 'Investigating the Vascular Phenotype of Subcutaneously and Orthotopically Propagated PC3 Prostate Cancer Xenografts Using Combined Carbogen Ultrasmall Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide MRI.', 'Photoacoustic imaging as a tool to probe the tumour microenvironment.', 'Performance evaluation of mesoscopic photoacoustic imaging.', 'Evaluation of the EPR Effect in the CAM-Model by Molecular Imaging with MRI and PET Using 89Zr-Labeled HSA.', 'TNF Signaling Is Required for Castration-Induced Vascular Damage Preceding Prostate Cancer Regression.', 'Multispectral optoacoustic tomography for the non-invasive identification of patients with severe anemia in vivo.', 'Deep learning facilitates fully automated brain image registration of optoacoustic tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.']"""

Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway was responsible for decreased osteoclastogenesis. Recently many studies indicated that niclosamide, the FDA approved an antihelminth drug, inhibits prostate and breast cancer cells growth by targeting NF-κB signaling pathways. This study evaluated the effects of niclosamide on osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation and function in vitro. In RANKL-induced murine osteoclast precursor cell RAW264.7 and M-CSF/RANKL-stimulated primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM), niclosamide dose-dependently inhibited the formation of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts and resorption pits formation between 0.5uM and 1uM. In addition, niclosamide suppressed the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) and osteoclast differentiated-related genes in M-CSF/ RANKL-stimulated BMM by interference with TRAF-6, Erk1/2, JNK and NF-κB activation pathways. However, the cytotoxic effects of niclosamide obviously appeared at the effective concentrations for inhibiting osteoclastogenesis (0.5-1uM) with increase of apoptosis through caspase-3 activation in osteoblast precursor cell line, MC3T3-E1. Niclosamide also inhibited ALP activity, bone mineralization and osteoblast differentiation-related genes expression in MC3T3-E1.

Materials and methods:   A total of 1,883 patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and 373 underwent partial gland ablation from July 2009 to September 2015. We selected 1,458 of these participants for analysis, including 1,222 and 236 treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and partial gland ablation, respectively. Patients had a Gleason score of 3 + 3 or 3 + 4, clinical stage T2b or less, prostate specific antigen 15 ng/dl or less, unilateral disease and life expectancy greater than 10 years. Propensity score matching analysis (1:2) was applied in the overall robot-assisted radical prostatectomy sample, which selected 472 patients for comparison. For partial gland ablation 188 men underwent high intensity focused ultrasound and 48 underwent cryotherapy. Oncologic outcomes were analyzed in terms of the need for salvage treatment. Partial gland ablation failure was defined as any positive control biopsy after treatment. Functional outcomes were assessed by validated questionnaires.  Results:   Matching was successful across the 2 groups, although men treated with partial gland ablation were older (p <0.001). Mean followup in the partial gland ablation group was 38.44 months. Partial gland ablation failure was observed in 68 men (28.8%), including 53 (28.1%) treated with high intensity focused ultrasound and 15 (31.2%) treated with cryotherapy. Partial gland ablation was associated with a higher risk of salvage treatment (HR 6.06, p <0.001). Complications were comparable between the groups (p = 0.06).

To this end, standard chemotherapeutic approaches have relied on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cytotoxic drugs with a long off-therapy interval, leading to heavy toxic side effects accompanied by drug resistance. To avoid the problems associated with the traditional MTD chemotherapy, metronomic chemotherapy with relatively low dose continuous treatments of cytotoxic drugs has been proposed as an alternative to the predominant paradigm of directly killing all cancer cells. Low-dose metronomic (LDM) chemotherapy is expected to have not only antitumor effects without toxicity and drug resistance, but also beneficial anti-angiogenic effects by causing selective apoptosis of tumor endothelial cells. In an attempt to keep the drug resistance under control and halt exponential tumor growth, herein, we combined LDM chemotherapy with a second anti-angiogenic strategy. The selective blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in combination with metronomic doxorubicin (Dox) induced synergistic antitumor effects mainly through an antiangiogenic mechanism. For specific VEGF suppression, VEGF-targeting siRNA was delivered to tumor tissue using polymerized siRNA/thiolated glycol chitosan (poly-siVEGF/tGC) nanoparticles, leading to efficient VEGF gene knockdown in tumor tissue with a sequence-specific manner. Although the single treatment with metronomic Dox and poly-siVEGF/tGC nanoparticles alone showed some antitumor activity, notably, the combination of the two therapies resulted in superb tumor regression without causing systemic toxicity or drug resistance. Thus, these results suggest that the VEGF-targeted RNAi using poly-siRNA/tGC nanoparticles in combination with LDM chemotherapy could be a promising synergistic strategy for controlling tumor growth by enhancing the efficacy of anti-angiogenesis while minimizing toxicity and drug resistance.""","""['Gijung Kwak', 'Sung Duk Jo', 'Dongkyu Kim', 'Hyosuk Kim', 'Myung Goo Kim', 'Kwangmeyung Kim', 'Ick Chan Kwon', 'Sun Hwa Kim']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['Cancer-targeted MDR-1 siRNA delivery using self-cross-linked glycol chitosan nanoparticles to overcome drug resistance.', 'Synergistic anti-tumor effects of bevacizumab and tumor targeted polymerized VEGF siRNA nanoparticles.', 'Co-delivery of VEGF and Bcl-2 dual-targeted siRNA polymer using a single nanoparticle for synergistic anti-cancer effects in vivo.', ""The potential clinical promise of 'multimodality' metronomic chemotherapy revealed by preclinical studies of metastatic disease."", 'Low-dose metronomic chemotherapy: a systematic literature analysis.', 'Efficient ocular delivery of siRNA via pH-sensitive vehicles for corneal neovascularization inhibition.', 'Recent advances of nanotechnology-based tumor vessel-targeting strategies.', 'Metronomic Anti-Cancer Therapy: A Multimodal Therapy Governed by the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Optimizing Adaptive Therapy Based on the Reachability to Tumor Resistant Subpopulation.', 'Carrier-free nanodrugs with efficient drug delivery and release for cancer therapy: From intrinsic physicochemical properties to external modification.']"""

Methods:   Men with pT2N0 PCa and a single positive surgical margin following radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy were identified (1987-1996). Men who received ART were matched 1:1 to men who did not receive ART based on age, year of surgery, Gleason score, preoperative prostate-specific antigen, site of positive surgical margin, and DNA ploidy. Biochemical recurrence (BCR), local recurrence, distant metastasis, and overall survival (OS) were compared between groups in time-to-event analyses.  Results:   The cohort included 152 men (76 per group) with a median follow-up of 20 years (interquartile range 19,22).

Patients managed in groups with IMRT ownership (n=5133) were more likely to receive IMRT than those managed by single-specialty groups without ownership (43% vs 30%, p<0.001), regardless of group size. Among patients with a very high risk (> 75%) of noncancer mortality within 10 yr of diagnosis, both IMRT use (42% vs 26%, p<0.001) and overall treatment (53% vs 44%, p<0.001) were more likely in groups with ownership than in those without, respectively.  Conclusions:   Urologists practicing in single-specialty groups with an ownership interest in radiation therapy are more likely to treat men with prostate cancer, including those with a high risk of noncancer mortality.  Patient summary:   We assessed treatment for prostate cancer among urologists with varying levels of financial incentives favoring intervention. Those with stronger incentives, as determined by ownership interest in a radiation facility, were more likely to treat prostate cancer, even when treatment was unlikely to provide a survival benefit to the patient.""","""['Brent K Hollenbeck', 'Samuel R Kaufman', 'Phyllis Yan', 'Lindsey A Herrel', 'Tudor Borza', 'Florian R Schroeck', 'Bruce L Jacobs', 'Ted A Skolarus', 'Vahakn B Shahinian']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate Cancer Care and Practice Patterns: Low-quality Observations Miss the Benefits from High-quality Care.', 'Urologist Practice Structure and Spending for Prostate Cancer Care.', ""Urologists' use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer."", 'Use of advanced treatment technologies among men at low risk of dying from prostate cancer.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Finding Value for Protons: The Case of Prostate Cancer?', ""The Influence of Practice Structure on Urologists' Treatment of Men With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer."", 'Urologist practice structure and quality of prostate cancer care.', ""Aortic valve replacement among patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias."", 'Understanding Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'Multilevel Factors Associated With More Intensive Use of Radioactive Iodine for Low-Risk Thyroid Cancer.']"""

A virtual IRS (V-IRS) was constructed to help identify the patients for whom it is cost-effective to implant an IRS, and its viability as a tool to tailor the decision of an IRS implantation to be beneficial for the specified patient was assessed. Please watch animation: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDlagSXMKqw) MATERIALS AND METHODS: The V-IRS was tested on 16 patients: 8 with a rectal balloon implant (RBI) and 8 with a hydrogel spacer. A V-IRS was developed using 7 computed tomography (CT) scans of patients with a RBI. To examine the V-IRS, CT scans before and after the implantation of an IRS were used. IMRT plans were made based on CT scans before the IRS, after IRS and with the V-IRS, prescribing 70 Gray (Gy) to the planning target volume. Toxicity was accessed using externally validated normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models, and the Cost-effectiveness was analyzed using a published Markov model.  Results:   The rectum volume receiving 75Gy (V75) were improved by both the IRS and the V-IRS with on average 4.2% and 4.3% respectively. The largest NTCP reduction resulting from the IRS and the V-IRS was 4.0% and 3.9% respectively. The RBI was cost-effective for 1 out of 8 patients, and the hydrogel was effective for 2 out of 8 patients, and close to effective for a third patient. The classification accuracy of the model, regarding cost-effectiveness, was 100%.  Conclusion:   The V-IRS approach in combination with a toxicity prediction model and a cost-effectiveness analyses is a promising basis for a decision support tool for the implantation of either a hydrogel spacer or a rectum balloon implant.""","""['Yvonka van Wijk', 'Ben G L Vanneste', 'Sean Walsh', 'Skadi van der Meer', 'Bram Ramaekers', 'Wouter van Elmpt', 'Michael Pinkawa', 'Philippe Lambin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Who will benefit most from hydrogel rectum spacer implantation in prostate cancer radiotherapy?

We investigated the impact of Gleason score (GS) on biochemical recurrence (BCR) in these patients.  Methods:   A retrospective, multicenter study was performed on 795 patients with pT3aN0/Nx PCa with PSM after RP between January 2006 and December 2014. Clinicopathologic characteristics of patients were examined and onset of BCR was identified. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to illustrate BCR-free survival (BFS) and Cox proportional hazard models were applied to identify factors predicting BCR.  Results:   During the mean follow-up period of 63.9 months, BCR was identified in 274 (34.5%) patients. The 5-year BFS was 56.6% in all patients. In multivariate analysis, pathologic GS was the only significant prognostic factor for BCR in patients with pT3aN0/Nx PCa with PSM (GS 6 vs. GS 7 (3 + 4), P = 0.047; vs. GS 7 (4 + 3), P = 0.007, and vs. GS 8-10, P < 0.001). When patients were stratified according to GS, 5-year BFS was 78.6% in GS 6, 66.2% in GS 7 (3 + 4), 51.1% in GS 7 (4 + 3) and 35.5% in GS 8-10.  Conclusions:   In patients with pT3aN0/Nx with PSM after RP, pathologic GS is the sole independent predictor for risk stratification of BCR. These findings might be used to determine the risk and timing of BCR and to help counsel patients regarding treatment strategy and prognosis of disease on an individual basis.""","""['Wan Song', 'Dong Hyeon Lee', 'Hwang Gyun Jeon', 'Byong Chang Jeong', 'Seong Il Seo', 'Hyun Moo Lee', 'Han Yong Choi', 'Jong Wook Kim', 'SangChul Lee', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Chang Wook Jeong', 'Cheol Kwak', 'Jin Seon Cho', 'Hanjong Ahn', 'Seong Soo Jeon']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Impact of positive surgical margin length and Gleason grade at the margin on biochemical recurrence in patients with organ-confined prostate cancer.', 'Risk and timing of biochemical recurrence in pT3aN0/Nx prostate cancer with positive surgical margin - A multicenter study.', 'Positive margin length and highest Gleason grade of tumor at the margin predict for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in patients with organ-confined prostate cancer.', 'Positive surgical margin is associated with biochemical recurrence risk following radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis from high-quality retrospective cohort studies.', 'Prognostic Value of Gleason Score at Positive Surgical Margin in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 is a histological marker reflecting the malignant behavior of prostate cancer.', 'The impact of lymphovascular invasion in patients with prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy and its association with their clinicopathological features: An updated PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

However, this inverse association between statin use and mortality may be due to selection bias and immortal-time bias.  Objective:   To emulate a randomized trial of statin therapy initiation that is free of selection bias and immortal-time bias.  Design, setting, and participants:   We used observational data on 17 372 patients with cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (2007-2009) with complete follow-up until 2011. The SEER-Medicare database links 17 US cancer registries and claims files from Medicare and Medicaid in 12 US states. We included individuals with a new diagnosis of colorectal, breast, prostate, or bladder cancer who had not been prescribed statins for at least 6 months before the cancer diagnosis. Individuals were duplicated, and each replicate was assigned to either the strategy ""statin therapy initiation within 6 months after diagnosis"" or ""no statin therapy initiation."" Replicates were censored when they stopped following their assigned strategy, and the potential selection bias was adjusted for via inverse-probability weighting. Hazard ratios (HRs), cumulative incidences, and risk differences were calculated for all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality. We then compared our estimates with those obtained using the same analytic approaches used in previous observational studies.  Exposures:   Statin therapy initiation within 6 months after cancer diagnosis.  Main outcomes and measures:   Cancer-specific and all-cause mortality using SEER-Medicare data and data from previous studies.  Results:   Of the 17 372 patients whose data were analyzed, 8440 (49%) were men, and 8932 (51%) were women (mean [SD] age, 76.4 [7.4] years; range, 66-115 years). The adjusted HR (95% CI) comparing statin therapy initiation vs no initiation was 1.00 (0.88-1.15) for cancer-specific mortality and 1.07 (0.93-1.21) for overall mortality. Cumulative incidence curves for both groups were almost overlapping (the risk difference never exceeded 0.8%). In contrast, the methods used by prior studies resulted in an inverse association between statin use and mortality (pooled hazard ratio 0.69).  Conclusion and relevance:   After using methods that are not susceptible to selection bias from prevalent users and to immortal time bias, we found that initiation of therapy with statins within 6 months after cancer diagnosis did not appear to improve 3-year cancer-specific or overall survival.""","""['Louise Emilsson', 'Xabier García-Albéniz', 'Roger W Logan', 'Ellen C Caniglia', 'Mette Kalager', 'Miguel A Hernán']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Errors in Table.', 'Association of Statin Use With Overall and Cancer Survival.', 'Association of Statin Use With Overall and Cancer Survival.', 'Association of Statin Use With Overall and Cancer Survival-Reply.', 'Statin treatment is associated with survival in a nationally representative population of elderly women with epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Association of Statin Use With All-Cause and Cardiovascular Mortality in US Veterans 75 Years and Older.', 'Use of Statin Medications Following Diagnosis in Relation to Survival among Women with Ovarian Cancer.', 'Perioperative statin therapy for improving outcomes during and after noncardiac vascular surgery.', 'Relationship between the use of statins and patient survival in colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Effect of Statins on the Incidence and Prognosis of Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Association of Wildfire Exposure While Recovering From Lung Cancer Surgery With Overall Survival.', 'Chronic prednisone, metformin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and clinical outcome in a cohort of bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy in Québec, Canada.', 'The association between prescription drugs and colorectal cancer prognosis: a nationwide cohort study using a medication-wide association study.', 'Target trial emulation of aspirin after diagnosis of colorectal polyps.']"""

A study of prostate and breast cancer screening in a Medicare population""","""Introduction:   Prostate and breast cancer screening in older patients continue to be controversial. Balancing the desire for early detection with avoidance of over-diagnosis has led to competing and contradictory guidelines for both practices. Despite similarities, it is not known how these screening practices are related at the regional level. In this study, we examined how screening PSA and mammography are related within healthcare regions, and, to better understand what may be driving these practices, whether they are associated with local intensity of care.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in 2012. For each of 306 hospital referral regions (HRRs), we calculated rates of PSA screening for men aged ≥68 years, as well as rates of screening mammography for women aged ≥75 years, adjusted for age and race. Additionally, we determined regional rates of ""healthcare intensity"", including spending on tests and procedures, and intensity of end-of-life care. Pearson correlations of adjusted rates were calculated within HRRs.  Results:   The mean adjusted rate of PSA screening was 22%. The mean age of screened and unscreened patients was 75.0 and 77.4 years, respectively (p<0.0001). The mean adjusted rate of screening mammography was 23%; mean ages of screened and non-screened women were 79.95 and 83.67, respectively (p<0.0001). HRR-level PSA screening rates were independent of screening mammography rates (r=0.06, p=0.31). PSA screening rates were associated with spending on testing and procedures (r=0.42, p<0.0001) and various measures of intensity of EOL care (e.g. r=0.40, p<0.0001 for mechanical ventilator use). Screening mammography had low correlation with both health care spending and EOL care intensity measures (all r-values <0.3).  Conclusions:   Regional rates of PSA screening rates were independent of screening mammography, thus these practices appear to be driven by different factors. Unlike mammography, PSA screening was associated with local enthusiasm for testing and treatment. Efforts to reduce over-testing should contemplate these practices differently, and future research should examine the factors motivating these screening practices.""","""['Eric Raffin', 'Tracy Onega', 'Julie Bynum', 'Andrea Austin', 'Donald Carmichael', 'Kristen Bronner', 'Philip Goodney', 'Elias S Hyams']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Regional-Level Correlations in Inappropriate Imaging Rates for Prostate and Breast Cancers: Potential Implications for the Choosing Wisely Campaign.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'Downstream tests, treatments, and annual direct payments in older men cared for by primary care providers with high or low prostate-specific antigen screening rates using 100 percent Texas U.S. Medicare public insurance claims data: a retrospective cohort study.', 'The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the USA.', 'American Urological Association (AUA) guideline on prostate cancer detection: process and rationale.', 'Factors Associated With Low-Value Cancer Screenings in the Veterans Health Administration.', 'Adoption of New Risk Stratification Technologies Within US Hospital Referral Regions and Association With Prostate Cancer Management.', 'Association Between Receipt of Cancer Screening and All-Cause Mortality in Older Adults.', 'Temporal trends and regional disparities in cancer screening utilization: an observational Swiss claims-based study.']"""

External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is non-invasive, standard of care and delivered in either conventional fractionation over 8 weeks or with moderate hypo-fractionation over about 5 weeks. Recent advances in radiotherapy technology have made extreme hypo-fractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of prostate cancer feasible, which has not yet been introduced as a standard treatment method in Germany. Initial results from other countries are promising, but long-term results are not yet available. The aim of this study is to investigate feasibility and effectiveness of SBRT for prostate cancer in Germany.  Methods/design:   This German bi-center single group trial (HYPOSTAT) is designed to evaluate feasibility and effectiveness, as measured by toxicity and PSA-response, respectively, of an extreme hypo-fractionated SBRT regimen with five fractions of 7 Gy in treatment of localized low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. The target volume includes the prostate with or without the base of seminal vesicles depending on risk stratification and uncertainty margins that are kept at 3-5 mm. SBRT treatment is delivered with the robotic CyberKnife system, which was recently introduced in Germany. Acute and late toxicity after one year will be evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v. 4.0), Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) Scores. The quality of life will be assessed before and after treatment with the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. Hypothesizing that the proportion of patients with grade 2 side effects or higher is less or equal than 2.8%, thus markedly lower than the standard EBRT percentage (17.5%), the recruitment target is 85 patients.  Discussion:   The HYPOSTAT trial aims at demonstrating short term feasibility of extreme hypo-fractioned SBRT for the treatment of prostate cancer and might be used as the pilot study for a multi-center multi-platform or for randomized-controlled trials comparing conventional radiotherapy with SBRT for localized prostate cancer in the future. The study concept of patient enrollment, follow up and evaluation by multiple public university clinics and actual patient treatment in dedicated private radiosurgery practices with high-tech radiation equipment is unique for clinical trials.

Objective:   To assess the comparative effectiveness of AC vs observation for patients with pT3/T4 and/or pN+ UCB previously treated with NAC and RC.  Design, setting, and participants:   This observational cohort study used the National Cancer Data Base (January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2012) to identify individuals who received NAC and RC followed by AC or observation for pT3/T4 and/or pN+ UCB.  Main outcomes and measures:   After multiple imputation was used to handle missing data, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed with a 6-month conditional landmark to compare overall survival (OS) among patients who received NAC and RC followed by AC vs observation. In addition, exploratory analyses were conducted to examine the heterogeneity of the treatment effect according to age (continuous), sex (female vs male), Charlson comorbidity index (≥1 vs 0), pT/N stage (pT3/T4N0 vs pTanyN+), and surgical margin status (positive vs negative) by testing interaction terms within the IPTW-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model.  Results:   Of the 788 patients with pT3/T4 and/or pN+ UCB (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [9.4] years; 603 [76.5%] male and 185 [23.5%] female), 184 (23.4%) received NAC and RC followed by AC and 604 (76.6%) received NAC and RC followed by observation. The 6-month conditional landmark, IPTW-adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves showed that median OS was significantly longer for NAC and RC followed by AC (29.9 months; interquartile range, 15.1-85.4 months) vs NAC and RC followed by observation (24.2 months; interquartile range, 12.9-58.9 months) (P = .046). The 5-year IPTW-adjusted rates of OS were 36.8% for NAC and RC followed by AC vs 24.7% for NAC and RC followed by observation. In the IPTW-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, NAC and RC followed by AC was associated with a significant OS benefit (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-0.99; P = .046). Interaction term analyses indicated that the OS benefit of NAC and RC followed by AC decreased significantly with age (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99; P = .02), whereas no significant interaction was observed with sex (P = .82), Charlson comorbidity index (P = .51), pT/N stage (P = .95), and surgical margin status (P = .29).  Conclusions and relevance:   This study found that AC after NAC and RC may be associated with an OS benefit for patients with pT3/T4 and/or pN+ UCB.

By using C4-2, CWR22Rv1 and LNCaP cell lines, as well as mice bearing CWR22Rv1 xenografts treated with either enzalutamide or metformin alone or in combination, we demonstrated that metformin is capable of reversing enzalutamide resistance and restores sensitivity of CWR22Rv1 xenografts to enzalutamide. We showed that metformin alleviated resistance to enzalutamide by inhibiting EMT. Furthermore, based on the effect of metformin on the activation of STAT3 and expression of TGF-β1, we propose that metformin exerts its effects by targeting the TGF-β1/STAT3 axis.

The aims of the present work were to investigate the relationship between benign and malignant sub-volumes of the prostate and textures obtained from mpMR images. The performance of tumor prediction was investigated based on the combination of histogram-based and textural parameters. Subsequently, the relative importance of mpMR images was assessed and the benefit of additional imaging analyzed. Finally, sub-structures based on the PI-RADS classification were investigated as potential regions to automatically detect maligned lesions. Twenty-five patients who received mpMRI prior to radical prostatectomy were included in the study. The imaging protocol included T2, DWI, and DCE. Delineation of tumor regions was performed based on pathological information. First and second order statistics were derived from each structure and for all image modalities. The resulting data were processed with multivariate analysis, using PCA (principal component analysis) and OPLS-DA (orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis) for separation of malignant and healthy tissue. PCA showed a clear difference between tumor and healthy regions in the peripheral zone for all investigated images. The predictive ability of the OPLS-DA models increased for all image modalities when first and second order statistics were combined. The predictive value reached a plateau after adding ADC and T2, and did not increase further with the addition of other image information. The present study indicates a distinct difference in the signatures between malign and benign prostate tissue. This is an absolute prerequisite for automatic tumor segmentation, but only the first step in that direction.

We report findings from a stakeholder engagement program that aimed to develop a framework for using Markov models with individualized model inputs, including genomics-based estimates of cancer recurrence probability, to generate personalized decision aids for prostate cancer patients faced with radiation therapy treatment decisions after prostatectomy.  Methods:   We engaged a total of 22 stakeholders, including: prostate cancer patients, urological surgeons, radiation oncologists, genomic testing industry representatives, and biomedical informatics faculty. Slides were at each meeting to provide background information regarding the analytical framework. Participants were invited to provide feedback during the meeting, including revising the overall project aims. Stakeholder meeting content was reviewed and summarized by stakeholder group and by theme.  Results:   The majority of stakeholder suggestions focused on aspects of decision aid design and formatting. Stakeholders were enthusiastic about the potential value of using decision analysis modeling with personalized model inputs for cancer recurrence risk, as well as competing risks from age and comorbidities, to generate a patient-centered tool to assist decision-making. Stakeholders did not view privacy considerations as a major barrier to the proposed decision aid program. A common theme was that decision aids should be portable across multiple platforms (electronic and paper), should allow for interaction by the user to adjust model inputs iteratively, and available to patients both before and during consult appointments. Emphasis was placed on the challenge of explaining the model's composite result of quality-adjusted life years.  Conclusions:   A range of stakeholders provided valuable insights regarding the design of a personalized decision aid program, based upon Markov modeling with individualized model inputs, to provide a patient-centered framework to support for genomic-based treatment decisions for cancer patients. The guidance provided by our stakeholders may be broadly applicable to the communication of genomic test results to patients in a patient-centered fashion that supports effective shared decision-making that represents a spectrum of personal factors such as age, medical comorbidities, and individual priorities and values.""","""['James Abe', 'Jennifer M Lobo', 'Daniel M Trifiletti', 'Timothy N Showalter']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""['Cost-effectiveness of the Decipher Genomic Classifier to Guide Individualized Decisions for Early Radiation Therapy After Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluating the clinical impact of a genomic classifier in prostate cancer using individualized decision analysis.', 'Reconsidering adjuvant versus salvage radiation therapy for prostate cancer in the genomics era.', 'Risk management frameworks for human health and environmental risks.', 'Stakeholder engagement: a key component of integrating genomic information into electronic health records.', 'Effective stakeholder engagement: design and implementation of a clinical trial (SWOG S1415CD) to improve cancer care.']"""

Although there are several strongly recommended biomarkers for determining prognosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, only few of them may help decide the selection of the optimal treatment option. The mode of treatment sequencing in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer will be based on the individual characteristics of the patient. In this study, we aimed to explain the correlation between the expression characteristics of periostin, integrin-α4, and fibronectin in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients and their clinico-pathological data comprising Gleason score, PSA levels, and metastatic sites in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We evaluated by using Western blotting, periostin, integrin-α4, and fibronectin expressions in peripheral blood samples of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients ( n = 40), benign prostatic hyperplasia patients ( n = 20), and the healthy control group ( n = 20). Associations between changes in the protein expressions and clinico-pathological parameters were also analyzed in the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer group. When comparing BPH and healthy groups with the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer group, a reduced expression of integrin-α4 was found in metastatic patients, albeit being statistically insignificant ( P > 0.05). Protein expressions of periostin and fibronectin in the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer group were higher than those in the BPH and heathy groups ( P < 0.001). Increased periostin expression in metastatic patients was significantly associated with bone metastasis ( P < 0.05). Elevated periostin and fibronectin levels in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients may be appropriate targets of therapeutic intervention in the future. Impact statement Prostate cancer is the third most common cancer in the world and the most common cancer among men. Development of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a result of the lack of an apoptotic response by the tumor cells and loss of the ability to stick to adjacent cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The present study analyzes for the first time the expressions of EMT marker proteins - periostin, integrin α4, fibronectin - in mCRPC and in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with the aim to determine the clinical relevance of changes in these three proteins vis-a-vis the PCa aggressive phenotype. In doing so, it sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying the disease.

Microarray data of PCa were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and DESeq package in R language were used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PCa and normal samples. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of DEGs was conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery.

Methods:   We retrospectively included 103 patients with suspicious PCA who underwent both RTE and initial transperineal prostate biopsy. Patients were grouped into high-risk and non-high-risk categories according to the D'Amico's risk stratification. With computer assistance based on MATLAB programming, three features were extracted from RTE, i.e., the median hardness within peripheral gland (PG) (H med), the ratio of the median hardness within PG to that outside PG (H ratio), and the ratio of the hard area within PG to the total PG area (H ar). A multiple regression model incorporating an RTE feature, age, transrectal ultrasound finding, and prostate volume was used to identify markers for high-risk PCA.  Results:   Forty-seven patients (45.6%) were diagnosed with PCA and 34 (33.0%) were diagnosed with high-risk PCA. Three RTE features were all statistically higher in high-risk PCA than in non-high-risk diseases (p < 0.001), indicating that the PGs in high-risk PCA patients were harder than those in non-high-risk patients. A high H ratio, high age, and low prostate volume were found to be independent markers for PCAs (p < 0.05), among which the high H ratio was the only independent marker for high-risk PCAs (p = 0.012). When predicting high-risk PCAs, the multiple regression achieved an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.755, sensitivity of 73.5%, and specificity of 71.0%.

Methods:   We calculated relative risks (RRs) for male breast cancer in families with discordant cancers, and conversely, for discordant cancers in families of male breast cancer patients, based on 15.7 million individuals in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database.  Results:   Among 1428 male breast cancer patients, 16.2% had a female relative diagnosed with breast cancer. Ovarian and female anal cancers showed the strongest associations with male breast cancer (p value < 0.0005).

To determine the mechanisms of action of TNF-α inhibitors in AS patients, we used transcriptomic and bioinformatic approaches on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from AS patients pre and post treatment. We found 656 differentially expressed genes, including the genome-wide significant AS-associated genes, IL6R, NOTCH1, IL10, CXCR2 and TNFRSF1A. A distinctive gene expression profile was found between male and female patients, mainly because of sex chromosome-linked genes and interleukin 17 receptor C, potentially accounting for the differences in clinical manifestation and treatment response between the genders.

Although effective tumor eradication and excellent safety profile are well demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies, incomplete vascular shutdown and angiogenesis are known to cause tumor recurrence after vascular-targeted PDT. We have explored therapeutic enhancement of vascular-targeted PDT with PI3K signaling pathway inhibitors because the activation of PI3K pathway was involved in promoting endothelial cell survival and proliferation after PDT. Here, three clinically relevant small-molecule inhibitors (BYL719, BKM120, and BEZ235) of the PI3K pathway were evaluated in combination with verteporfin-PDT. Although all three inhibitors were able to synergistically enhance PDT response in endothelial cells, PDT combined with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 exhibited the strongest synergism, followed in order by combinations with pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and p110α isoform-selective inhibitor BYL719. Combination treatments of PDT and BEZ235 exhibited a cooperative inhibition of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 and induced more cell apoptosis than each treatment alone. In addition to increasing treatment lethality, BEZ235 combined with PDT effectively inhibited PI3K pathway activation and consequent endothelial cell proliferation after PDT alone, leading to a sustained growth inhibition. In the PC-3 prostate tumor model, combination treatments improved treatment outcomes by turning a temporary tumor regrowth delay induced by PDT alone to a more long-lasting treatment response. Our study strongly supports the combination of vascular-targeted PDT and PI3K pathway inhibitors, particularly mTOR inhibitors, for therapeutic enhancement.

The rapidly increasing number of cancer survivors, resulting from aging and improved cancer care, emphasizes the importance to develop and provide low cost, easy accessible PA programs. Such programs could be provided through the Internet, but that could result in the exclusion of cancer survivors not familiar with the Internet. Therefore, we developed a computer-tailored PA intervention for prostate and colorectal cancer survivors in which both Web-based and print materials are provided, and participants can choose their own preferred delivery mode.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to assess participants' characteristics related to delivery mode and use of intervention materials.  Methods:   We studied characteristics of participants using Web-based and printed intervention materials in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Prostate and colorectal cancer survivors recruited from hospitals were randomized to OncoActive (computer-tailored PA intervention) or a usual-care control group. OncoActive participants received both Web-based and printed materials. Participants were classified into initial print- or Web-based participants based on their preferred mode of completion of the first questionnaire, which was needed for the computer-tailored PA advice. Intervention material use during the remainder of the intervention was compared for initial print- or Web-based participants. Additionally, participants were classified into those using only print materials and those using Web-based materials. Differences in participant characteristics and intervention material use were studied through analysis of variance (ANOVAs), chi-square tests, and logistic regressions.  Results:   The majority of the participants in the intervention group were classified as initial Web-based participants (170/249, 68.3%), and 84.9% (191/249) used Web-based intervention materials. Dropout was low (15/249, 6.0%) and differed between initial Web-based (4/170, 2.4%) and print-based (11/79, 14%) participants. Participants were less likely to start Web-based with higher age (odds ratio [OR]=0.93), longer time since last treatment (OR=0.87), and higher fatigue (OR=0.96), and more likely with higher education (OR=4.08) and having completed treatments (OR=5.58). Those who were older (OR=0.93) and post treatment for a longer time (OR=0.86) were less likely to use Web-based intervention materials. Initial print-based participants predominantly used print-based materials, whereas initial Web-based participants used both print- and Web-based materials.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that assessed participant characteristics related to delivery mode in an intervention in which participants had a free choice of delivery modes. Use of print-based materials among the initial Web-based participants was substantial, indicating the importance of print-based materials. According to our findings, it may be important to offer Web- and print-based materials alongside each other. Providing Web-based materials only may exclude older, less educated, more fatigued, or currently treated participants; these groups are especially more vulnerable and could benefit most from PA interventions.""","""['Rianne Henrica Johanna Golsteijn', 'Catherine Bolman', 'Denise Astrid Peels', 'Esmee Volders', 'Hein de Vries', 'Lilian Lechner']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Med Internet Res""","""['Development of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention for prostate and colorectal cancer patients and survivors: OncoActive.', 'Short-term efficacy of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention for prostate and colorectal cancer patients and survivors: a randomized controlled trial.', 'A Web-Based and Print-Delivered Computer-Tailored Physical Activity Intervention for Older Adults: Pretest-Posttest Intervention Study Comparing Delivery Mode Preference and Attrition.', 'Telephone, print, and Web-based interventions for physical activity, diet, and weight control among cancer survivors: a systematic review.', 'Understanding acceptability of and engagement with Web-based interventions aiming to improve quality of life in cancer survivors: A synthesis of current research.', 'The Barriers and Facilitators of eHealth-Based Lifestyle Intervention Programs for People With a Low Socioeconomic Status: Scoping Review.', 'Demographic and Psychosocial Characteristics Associated With Use of a Prostate Cancer Survivorship Website: Implications From a Multisite Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'A Digital Innovation for the Personalized Management of Adherence: Analysis of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.', 'Acceptability and Preliminary Efficacy of a Web- and Telephone-Based Personalised Exercise Intervention for Individuals with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: The ExerciseGuide Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial.', 'Usability, Acceptability, and Safety Analysis of a Computer-Tailored Web-Based Exercise Intervention (ExerciseGuide) for Individuals With Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Multi-Methods Laboratory-Based Study.']"""

Recently a series of carbobicyclo and oxabicyclo succinimide analogs were reported to effectively antagonize AR. In this study, to explore the structural requirements for these AR antagonists, we performed quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis on carbobicyclo and oxabicyclo succinimide analogs by using two-dimensional multiple linear regressions (MLR) method and three-dimension comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) methods.

Because of the low soft-tissue contrast on CT images, prostate segmentation is a challenging task. A learning-based segmentation method is proposed for the prostate on three-dimensional (3D) CT images.  Methods:   We combine population-based and patient-based learning methods for segmenting the prostate on CT images. Population data can provide useful information to guide the segmentation processing. Because of inter-patient variations, patient-specific information is particularly useful to improve the segmentation accuracy for an individual patient. In this study, we combine a population learning method and a patient-specific learning method to improve the robustness of prostate segmentation on CT images. We train a population model based on the data from a group of prostate patients. We also train a patient-specific model based on the data of the individual patient and incorporate the information as marked by the user interaction into the segmentation processing. We calculate the similarity between the two models to obtain applicable population and patient-specific knowledge to compute the likelihood of a pixel belonging to the prostate tissue. A new adaptive threshold method is developed to convert the likelihood image into a binary image of the prostate, and thus complete the segmentation of the gland on CT images.  Results:   The proposed learning-based segmentation algorithm was validated using 3D CT volumes of 92 patients. All of the CT image volumes were manually segmented independently three times by two, clinically experienced radiologists and the manual segmentation results served as the gold standard for evaluation. The experimental results show that the segmentation method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 87.18 ± 2.99%, compared to the manual segmentation.  Conclusions:   By combining the population learning and patient-specific learning methods, the proposed method is effective for segmenting the prostate on 3D CT images. The prostate CT segmentation method can be used in various applications including volume measurement and treatment planning of the prostate.""","""['Ling Ma', 'Rongrong Guo', 'Guoyi Zhang', 'David M Schuster', 'Baowei Fei']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A semiautomatic segmentation method for prostate in CT images using local texture classification and statistical shape modeling.', 'Combining Population and Patient-Specific Characteristics for Prostate Segmentation on 3D CT Images.', 'A random walk-based segmentation framework for 3D ultrasound images of the prostate.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Muscle Segmentation for Orthopedic Interventions.', 'Role of Machine Learning-Based CT Body Composition in Risk Prediction and Prognostication: Current State and Future Directions.', 'CT Male Pelvic Organ Segmentation via Hybrid Loss Network With Incomplete Annotation.', 'Deep learning-based three-dimensional segmentation of the prostate on computed tomography images.', 'CT male pelvic organ segmentation using fully convolutional networks with boundary sensitive representation.', 'A semiautomatic algorithm for three-dimensional segmentation of the prostate on CT images using shape and local texture characteristics.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 46 patients with biopsy-proven GS 6 prostate cancer, 3-T DWI results, and surgical pathologic results were retrospectively included in the study. DWI data were postprocessed with monoexponential and DK models to quantify the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), apparent diffusion for gaussian distribution (Dapp), and apparent kurtosis coefficient (Kapp). The volume of the lesions, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and diffusion variables (ADCmin, Dappmin, Kappmax, ADCmean, Dappmean, and Kappmean) were evaluated. PSA and DKI were combined as a parameter in a logistic regression model. The utility of these parameters in predicting an upgrade in GS was analyzed with ROC regression.  Results:   The rate of GS upgrade was 50.0% (23/46). The GS upgrade group had significantly lower ADCmin (p = 0.007), ADC mean (p = 0.003), D appmin (p < 0.001), and Dappmean (p = 0.001) values and significantly higher Kappmax (p = 0.003), Kappmean (p = 0.005), and PSA (p = 0.004) values than the group that did not have an upgrade. Among single parameters, Kappmax had the highest ROC AUC value (0.819, p < 0.05), and among all the parameters and models, PSA-Kappmax had the highest AUC (0.868, p < 0.05) and Youden index (0.6522).

Patients with a minimum follow-up of 6 months were eligible for analysis. Adverse events were monitored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0). Patient-reported QoL data were collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), the American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score and the 12-item short-from health survey (SF-12) physical and mental component summary questionnaires. Oncological control was evaluated according to serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA), 6-month multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and 12-month prostate biopsy. Wilcoxon's signed rank test was used to assess QoL differences over time in paired continuous variables.  Results:   A total of 18 patients were included in the analysis.

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of 79 patients with oligometastatic PCa treated with RARP or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) between 2005 and 2015 at our institution. Of these 79 patients, 38 were treated with RARP and 41 were treated with ADT without local therapy. Oligometastatic disease was defined as the presence of five or fewer hot spots detected by preoperative bone scan. We evaluated peri-operative outcomes, progression-free survival (PFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS). We analysed data using Kaplan-Meier methods, with log-rank tests and multivariate Cox regression models.  Results:   Patients treated with RARP experienced similar postoperative complications to those previously reported in RP-treated patients, and fewer urinary complications than ADT-treated patients. PFS and CSS were longer in RARP-treated compared with ADT-treated patients (median PFS: 75 vs 28 months, P = 0.008; median CSS: not reached vs 40 months, P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis further identified RARP as a significant predictor of PFS and CSS (PFS: hazard ratio [HR] 0.388, P = 0.003; CSS: HR 0.264, P = 0.004).  Conclusions:   We showed that RARP in the setting of oligometastatic PCa is a safe and feasible procedure which improves oncological outcomes in terms of PFS and CSS. In addition, our data suggest that RARP effectively prevents urinary tract complications from PCa. The study highlights results from expert surgeons and highly selected patients that cannot be extrapolated to all patients with oligometastatic PCa; to confirm our findings, large, prospective, multicentre studies are required.""","""['Won Sik Jang', 'Myung Soo Kim', 'Won Sik Jeong', 'Ki Don Chang', 'Kang Su Cho', 'Won Sik Ham', 'Koon Ho Rha', 'Sung Joon Hong', 'Young Deuk Choi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""[""Is it time for a more 'proactive' approach to metastatic prostate cancer?"", 'Surgery for oligometastatic prostate cancer: ready for prime time?', 'Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: Results of a Single-institution Series with Long-term Follow-up.', 'Oncologic Outcomes After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Large European Single-centre Cohort with Median 10-Year Follow-up.', 'Comparison of oncological and health-related quality of life outcomes between open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localised\xa0prostate cancer - findings from the population-based Victorian Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy - review of the literature concerning oncological and functional outcome of patients.', 'The diagnosis and treatment of castrate-sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer: A review.', 'Oncological and perioperative outcomes of surgery with or without metastasis-directed therapy as part of a multimodal treatment in men with de-novo oligometastatic prostate cancer.', 'Outcomes of prostate cancer patients after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy in Korea.', 'Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy for metastases prostate cancer: Evidence from meta-analysis.', 'Cytoreductive prostatectomy improves survival outcomes in patients with oligometastases: a systematic meta-analysis.']"""

Although positron emission tomography (PET) is ideally suited for acquisition of dosimetric data because PET is inherently quantitative and offers high sensitivity and spatial resolution, it is not directly applicable for this purpose because common therapeutic radionuclides lack the necessary positron emission. This work reports on the synthesis of dual-nuclide labeled radiopharmaceuticals with therapeutic and PET functionality, which are based on common and widely available metal radionuclides. Dual-chelator conjugates, featuring interlinked cyclen- and triazacyclononane-based polyphosphinates DOTPI and TRAP, allow for strictly regioselective complexation of therapeutic (e.g., 177 Lu, 90 Y, or 213 Bi) and PET (e.g., 68 Ga) radiometals in the same molecular framework by exploiting the orthogonal metal ion selectivity of these chelators (DOTPI: large cations, such as lanthanide(III) ions; TRAP: small trivalent ions, such as GaIII ). Such DOTPI-TRAP conjugates were decorated with 3 Gly-urea-Lys (KuE) motifs for targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), employing Cu-catalyzed (CuAAC) as well as strain-promoted (SPAAC) click chemistry. These were labeled with 177 Lu or 213 Bi and 68 Ga and used for in vivo imaging of LNCaP (human prostate carcinoma) tumor xenografts in SCID mice by PET, thus proving practical applicability of the concept.""","""['Alexander Wurzer', 'Christof Seidl', 'Alfred Morgenstern', 'Frank Bruchertseifer', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Johannes Notni']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Chemistry""","""['Phosphinic acid functionalized polyazacycloalkane chelators for radiodiagnostics and radiotherapeutics: unique characteristics and applications.', 'Dendritic poly-chelator frameworks for multimeric bioconjugation.', 'A shortcut to high-affinity Ga-68 and Cu-64 radiopharmaceuticals: one-pot click chemistry trimerisation on the TRAP platform.', 'Tailored Gallium(III) chelator NOPO: synthesis, characterization, bioconjugation, and application in preclinical Ga-68-PET imaging.', 'Matching chelators to radiometals for radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Targeted Alpha-Particle Therapy: A Review of Current Trials.', 'Tetra-fluorinated aromatic azide for highly efficient bioconjugation in living cells.', 'Selective and clean synthesis of aminoalkyl-H-phosphinic acids from hypophosphorous acid by phospha-Mannich reaction.', 'PSMA: a game changer in the diagnosis and treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'The Future of PSMA-Targeted Radionuclide Therapy: An Overview of Recent Preclinical Research.']"""

Secondly, this study describes a novel offline quality assurance tool, based on commercial dose calculation algorithms.  Methods:   Online dose reconstruction for VMAT is a computationally challenging task in terms of computer memory usage and calculation speed. To potentially reduce the amount of memory used, we analyzed the impact of beam angle sampling for dose calculation on the accuracy of the dose distribution. To establish the performance of the method, we planned two single-arc VMAT prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy cases for delivery with dynamic MLC tracking. For quality assurance of our online dose reconstruction method we have also developed a stand-alone offline dose reconstruction tool, which utilizes the RayStation treatment planning system to calculate dose.  Results:   For the online reconstructed dose distributions of the tracked deliveries, we could establish strong resemblance for 72 and 36 beam co-planar equidistant beam samples with less than 1.2% deviation for the assessed dose-volume indicators (clinical target volume D98 and D2, and rectum D2). We could achieve average runtimes of 28-31 ms per reported MLC aperture for both dose computation and accumulation, meeting our real-time requirement. To cross-validate the offline tool, we have compared the planned dose to the offline reconstructed dose for static deliveries and found excellent agreement (3%/3 mm global gamma passing rates of 99.8%-100%).  Conclusion:   Being able to reconstruct dose during delivery enables online quality assurance and online replanning strategies for VMAT. The offline quality assurance tool provides the means to validate novel online dose reconstruction applications using a commercial dose calculation engine.""","""['Cornelis Ph Kamerling', 'Martin F Fast', 'Peter Ziegenhein', 'Martin J Menten', 'Simeon Nill', 'Uwe Oelfke']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.', 'Fast motion-including dose error reconstruction for VMAT with and without MLC tracking.', 'An in vivo dose verification method for SBRT-VMAT delivery using the EPID.', 'Texture analysis on the fluence map to evaluate the degree of modulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'A Literature Review of Online Identity Reconstruction.', 'Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.', 'Automatic reconstruction of the delivered dose of the day using MR-linac treatment log files and online MR imaging.', 'Real-time intrafraction motion monitoring in external beam radiotherapy.', 'Validation of new transmission detector transmission factors for online dosimetry: an experimental study.']"""

The authors examined the prevalence of definitive therapy in elderly patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease.  Methods:   411,343 patients who were diagnosed from 2004 through 2012 with intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer were identified in the National Cancer Database. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidity was used to examine the association between age and receipt of definitive therapy, defined as radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, and of primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) among patients who did not receive definitive therapy.  Results:   In total, 87.1% of high-risk patients and 91.9% of intermediate-risk patients received definitive therapy. When stratified by age, 93.7%, 92.1%, 90.8%, 87.6%, 80.9%, and 55.2% of high-risk patients and 96.1%, 94.7%, 93.4%, 89.7%, 82.7%, and 62.8% of intermediate-risk patients ages <60, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, and ≥80 years received definitive therapy, respectively. For both high-risk and intermediate-risk patients, increasing age was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving definitive therapy overall (both P < .001) and a greater likelihood of receiving primary ADT among those who did not receive definitive therapy (both P < .001).  Conclusions:   Older age was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving definitive therapy and an increased likelihood of receiving primary ADT in this national cohort of patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer. Notably, approximately 40% to 45% of patients aged ≥80 years did not receive definitive therapy.

However, a drug resistance problem appears after about one year's treatment. AR T877A is the first mutation that was found to cause a resistance problem. Then W741C_T877A and F876L_T877A mutations were also reported to cause resistance to HF, while W741C and F876L single mutations cannot. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) method have been carried out to analyze the interaction mechanism between HF and wild-type (WT)/mutant ARs. The obtained results indicate that AR helix 12 (H12) plays a pivotal role in the resistance of HF. It can affect the coactivator binding site at the activation function 2 domain (AF2, surrounded by H3, H4, and H12). When H12 closes to the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) like a lid, the coactivator binding site can be formed to promote transcription. However, once H12 is opened to expose LBD, the coactivator binding site will be distorted, leading to invalid transcription. Moreover, per-residue free energy decomposition analyses indicate that N705, T877, and M895 are vital residues in the agonist/antagonist mechanism of HF.""","""['Hong-Li Liu', 'Hai-Yang Zhong', 'Tian-Qing Song', 'Jia-Zhong Li']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Study of the impact of the T877A mutation on ligand-induced helix-12 positioning of the androgen receptor resulted in design and synthesis of novel antiandrogens.', 'Molecular mechanism of R-bicalutamide switching from androgen receptor antagonist to agonist induced by amino acid mutations using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation.', 'Molecular Dynamics Studies on the Enzalutamide Resistance Mechanisms Induced by Androgen Receptor Mutations.', 'Functional analysis of androgen receptor N-terminal and ligand binding domain interacting coregulators in prostate cancer.', 'Domain functions of the androgen receptor.', 'Biomarkers of Castrate Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Androgen Receptor Amplification and T877A Mutation Detection by Multiplex Droplet Digital PCR.', 'Spirocyclic Thiohydantoin Antagonists of F877L and Wild-Type Androgen Receptor for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor-Dependent Mechanisms Mediating Drug Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular mechanism of point mutation-induced Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1/TTK) inhibitor resistance revealed by a comprehensive molecular modeling study.', 'Endocrine Disruption at the Androgen Receptor: Employing Molecular Dynamics and Docking for Improved Virtual Screening and Toxicity Prediction.']"""

Implementation of SDM is challenging secondary to time constraints and competing patient priorities. One strategy to mitigate the difficulties in implementing SDM is to utilize a decision aid (DA). Here we evaluate whether a DA improves a patient's prostate cancer knowledge and affects prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening rates.  Materials and methods:   Patients were randomized to usual care (UC), DA, or DA + SDM. Perception of quality of care was measured using the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey. Outcomes were stratified by long term provider relationship (LTPR, > 3 years) versus short term provider relationship (STPR, < 3 years). Knowledge of prostate cancer screening and the decision regarding screening were assessed. Groups were compared using ANOVA and logistic regression models.  Results:   A total of 329 patients were randomized. Patients in the DA + SDM arm were significantly more likely to report discussing the implication of screening (33% DA + SDM, 22% UC, 16% DA, p = 0.0292) and answered significantly more knowledge questions correctly compared to the UC arm (5.03 versus 4.46, p = 0.046). However, those in the DA arm were significantly less likely to report that they always felt encouraged to discuss all health concerns (72% DA, 78% DA + SDM, 87% UC, p = 0.0285). Interestingly, STPR patients in the DA arm were significantly more likely to undergo PSA-based prostate cancer screening (41%) than the UC arm (8%, p = 0.019). This effect was not observed in the LTPR group.  Conclusions:   Providing patients a DA without a personal interaction resulted in a greater chance of undergoing PSA-based screening without improving knowledge about screening or understanding of the consequences of this decision. This effect was exacerbated by a shorter term provider relationship. With complex issues such as the decision to pursue PSA-based prostate cancer screening, tools cannot substitute for direct interaction with a trusted provider.""","""['Andrew W Stamm', 'John S Banerji', 'Erika M Wolff', 'April Slee', 'Sydney Akapame', 'Kathryn Dahl', 'John D Massman I I I', 'Michael C Soung', 'Kim R Pittenger', 'John M Corman']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Randomized trial of community health worker-led decision coaching to promote shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening among Black male patients and their providers.', 'Prostate cancer screening decision-making in three states: 2013 behavioral risk factor surveillance system analysis.', 'Fostering shared decision-making about prostate cancer screening among African American men patients and their primary care providers: a randomized behavioral clinical trial.', 'Shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening and treatment: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.', 'The Effects of Shared Decision Making on Cancer Screening – A Systematic Review Internet.', 'The Impact of Choosing Wisely Interventions on Low-Value Medical Services: A Systematic Review.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening Patient Decision Aids: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Testing of a Tool for Prostate Cancer Screening Discussions in Primary Care.', ""Primary Care Providers' Intended Use of Decision Aids for Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing for Prostate Cancer Screening.""]"""

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and predictors of post-TURP incontinence in previously radiated patients.  Materials and methods:   One-hundred and eleven patients who underwent brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer with subsequent TURP performed between 1992 and 2012 at a single institution were identified. We tested for associations between post-TURP continence status and pre-TURP predictors including age, preoperative urinary symptoms and type and timing of radiation therapy.  Results:   New-onset incontinence developed in 27% (95% CI 17%, 39%) of patients after first post-radiation TURP and 32% (95% CI 23%, 42%) of patients after any TURP, including repeat TURPs. Forty-three percent of patients had resolution of incontinence with first TURP (95% CI 25%, 63%); only 25% (95% CI 7%, 52%) of patients had resolution following repeat TURPs. Age was significantly associated with incontinence (OR per 10 years 2.02, 95% CI 1.10, 3.74, p = 0.024). Post-TURP incontinence was more common in men with pre-TURP urgency.  Conclusions:   Rates of post-TURP incontinence were higher in men who were older or had pre-TURP urinary urgency. Assessment of preoperative symptoms would allow for better patient selection.

We aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related molecules (Twist-1 and E-cadherin) and the stem cell marker EZH2 in prostate cancer and to assess their ability to identify the high-risk patients, in a trial to explore their prognostic implications.  Material and method:   Immunohistochemical expression of Twist-1, E-cadherin and EZH2 in 50 specimens of prostate cancer and 20 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia were studied. The relationship between their expression and the clinicopathological variables, biochemical recurrence, and biochemical progression-free survival were investigated.  Results:   Our results revealed that high Twist-1, as well as high EZH2 expression, was strongly associated with higher pre-treatment PSA level, Gleason score ≥7, advanced tumor stage, lymph node involvement, distant metastasis and biochemical progression. Aberrant E-cadherin expression was significantly associated with higher pre-treatment PSA level, Gleason score ≥7, advanced tumor stage, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis. A significant positive correlation between Twist-1 and EZH2 expression was found (p < 0.001), while E-cadherin expression showed a negative correlation with both markers (p < 0.001). A significant association was found between high Twist-1, high EZH2& aberrant E-cadherin expression, and shorter biochemical progression-free survival.  Conclusion:   The high Twist-1 expression, aberrant E-cadherin and high EZH2 expression in primary prostate cancer are considered as adverse prognostic markers of an aggressive tumor with high metastatic potential. Assessment of their expression level would contribute to the accurate prediction of biochemical progression.""","""['Aziza E Abdelrahman', 'Shimaa A Arafa', 'Ragab A Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Turk Patoloji Derg""","""['The epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulators Twist, Slug, and Snail are associated with aggressive tumour features and poor outcome in prostate cancer patients.', 'Prognostic value of Twist, Snail and E-cadherin expression in pathological N0 non-small-cell lung cancer: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Prognostic Value of TWIST1 and EZH2 Expression in Colon Cancer.', 'Significance of TWIST and E-cadherin expression in the metastatic progression of prostatic cancer.', 'New and Emerging Diagnostic and Prognostic Immunohistochemical Biomarkers in Prostate Pathology.', 'Inhibition of MicroRNA miR-101-3p on prostate cancer progression by regulating Cullin 4B (CUL4B) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.', 'E-Cadherin expression in human tumors: a tissue microarray study on 10,851 tumors.', 'The epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulators Twist, Slug, and Snail are associated with aggressive tumour features and poor outcome in prostate cancer patients.', 'The Prospect of Identifying Resistance Mechanisms for Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Using Circulating Tumor Cells: Is Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition a Key Player?', 'E-Cadherin Downregulation is Mediated by Promoter Methylation in Canine Prostate Cancer.']"""

The study aim was to investigate the association between statin use at time of PCa diagnosis and time to PCa progression in men with advanced or metastatic PCa receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as primary treatment.  Patients and methods:   The study population consisted of all men receiving ADT as primary therapy at two Danish Urological Departments in 2007-2013. The primary outcome was time to progression defined as castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) or PCa death. Survival analyses were conducted with Kaplan-Meier analyses, cause specific Cox proportional hazards models, and competing risk analyses.  Results:   A total of 537 men were included, of whom 141 were statin users at time of diagnosis. The median follow-up time was 5.7 years (95% CI: 5.1-6.2). No significant difference in progression-free survival between statin users and non-statin users was observed at 5 years; 29% for statin users (95% CI: 19-40%) and 28% (95% CI: 23-34%) for non-statin users, p = 0.31. In multivariable Cox analyses, there was no significant association between statin use and risk of progression, HR 0.98 (95% CI: 0.72-1.32).

We aimed to explore the frequency and degree of uptake in peripheral ganglia in patients undergoing PET with the PSMA-targeted agent 18F-DCFPyL.  Methods:   A total of 98 patients who underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging were retrospectively analyzed. This included 76 men with prostate cancer (PCa) and 22 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC; 13 men, 9 women). Scans were evaluated for uptake in the cervical, stellate, celiac, lumbar and sacral ganglia. Maximum standardized uptake value corrected to body weight (SUVmax), and maximum standardized uptake value corrected to lean body mass (SULmax) were recorded for all ganglia with visible uptake above background. Ganglia-to-background ratios were calculated by dividing the SUVmax and SULmax values by the mean uptake in the ascending aorta (Aortamean) and the right gluteus muscle (Gluteusmean).  Results:   Overall, 95 of 98 (96.9%) patients demonstrated uptake in at least one of the evaluated peripheral ganglia. With regard to the PCa cohort, the most frequent sites of radiotracer accumulation were lumbar ganglia (55/76, 72.4%), followed by the cervical ganglia (51/76, 67.1%). Bilateral uptake was found in the majority of cases [lumbar 44/55 (80%) and cervical 30/51 (58.8%)]. Additionally, discernible radiotracer uptake was recorded in 50/76 (65.8%) of the analyzed stellate ganglia and in 45/76 (59.2%) of the celiac ganglia, whereas only 5/76 (6.6%) of the sacral ganglia demonstrated 18F-DCFPyL accumulation. Similar findings were observed for patients with RCC, with the most frequent locations of radiotracer uptake in both the lumbar (20/22, 90.9%) and cervical ganglia (19/22, 86.4%). No laterality preference was found in mean PSMA-ligand uptake for either the PCa or RCC cohorts.  Conclusion:   As PSMA-targeted agents become more widely disseminated, the patterns of uptake in structures that are not directly relevant to patients' cancers must be understood. This is the first systematic evaluation of the uptake of 18F-DCFPyL in ganglia demonstrating a general trend with a descending frequency of radiotracer accumulation in lumbar, cervical, stellate, celiac, and sacral ganglia.

According to published studies, patients undergoing RARP are at increased risk of being diagnosed with an inguinal hernia after RARP and are four times more likely to have an inguinal hernia repair (IHR) following RARP. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of IHR during RARP. Overall, it has been observed that IHR adds on average, 12-15 min in total surgical time and there were no significant differences between RARP with or without IHR with respect to postoperative complications. This study analyzes a large series of patients undergoing RARP (1100) and compares them to a group that underwent RARP with IHR (39). Between December 2008 and January 2015, 1139 patients underwent RARP at Florida Hospital in Celebration, FL. Of the total patients, 39 underwent concomitant IHR. All procedures were performed by the same surgeons (urologist and general surgeon), using the same techniques of RARP and TAPP inguinal hernia repair. After 30 days, the differences were evaluated between groups regarding surgical time, EBL and postoperative complications. The average age of patients undergoing the procedure was 61.65 years. The mean procedure time was approximately 120 min (min), with an additional period of 68 min for IHR (mean = 188; p = 0.0001). There was a significant difference in BMI between the groups, 28.3 kg/m2 for patients undergoing RARP and 26.8 kg/m2 for those who underwent RARP and IHR (p = 0.028). The EBL averaged 110.87 mL, with no significant difference between groups (p = 0371). There was no significant association between clinical stage of the patient and the type of procedure performed (p = 12:35). There was no significant difference in the presence of comorbidities and the operation preformed. There were 61 events recorded postoperatively, 57 (5.2%) among patients who underwent only RARP and 4 (10.26%) among those who had both. Taken together, the small amounts of complications in both groups prevent statistical significance. This study compared two groups of patients undergoing RARP: those with IHR and those without. Our study demonstrated an increase in surgical time; however, there was no increase in postoperative complications. From the data presented, we suggest that the performance of both procedures concomitantly is feasible and safe.""","""['Travis Rogers', 'Eduardo Parra-Davila', 'Flavio Malcher', 'Carlos Hartmann', 'Bernardo Mastella', 'Guiherme de Araújo', 'Gabriel Ogaya-Pinies', 'Carlos Ortiz-Ortiz', 'Eduardo Hernandez-Cardona', 'Vipul Patel', 'Leandro Totti Cavazzola']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['Nonprosthetic Direct Inguinal Hernia Repair During Robotic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Does robotic-assisted transabdominal preperitoneal (R-TAPP) hernia repair facilitate contralateral investigation and repair without compromising patient morbidity?', 'Simultaneous Inguinal Hernia Repair with Monofilament Polypropylene Mesh during Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Single Institute Series.', 'Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Inguinal Hernia Repair at the Time of Robotic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Minimally Invasive Hernia Repair in Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Evidence-based evolution of our robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) technique through 13,000 cases.', 'Influence of previous laparo-endoscopic inguinal hernia repair on performing radical prostatectomy: a nationwide survey among urological surgeons.', 'Minimally invasive inguinal hernia repair is superior to open: a national database review.']"""

The patterns arise in part from the stochastic or noisy reaction kinetics associated with the small number of genomes, enzymes, and other molecules that typically initiate virus replication and activate cellular anti-viral defenses. It is not known what features, if any, of the early viral or cellular gene expression correlate with later processes of viral replication or cell survival. Here we used two fluorescent reporters to visualize innate immune activation of human prostate cancer (PC3) cells against infection by vesicular stomatitis virus. The cells were engineered to express green-fluorescent protein under control of the promoter for IFIT2, an interferon-sensitive component of the anti-viral response, while red-fluorescent protein was expressed as a byproduct of virus infection. To isolate and quantitatively analyze single-cells, we used a unique microwell array device and open-source image processing software. Kinetic analysis of viral and cellular reporter profiles from hundreds of cells revealed novel relationships between gene expression and the outcome of infection. Specifically, the relative timing rather than the magnitude of the viral gene expression and innate immune activation correlated with the infection outcome. Earlier viral or anti-viral gene expression favored or hindered virus growth, respectively. Further, analysis of kinetic parameters estimated from these data suggests a trade-off between robust antiviral signaling and cell death, as indicated by a higher rate of detectable cell lysis in infected cells with a detectable immune response. In short, cells that activate an immune response lyse at a higher rate. More broadly, we demonstrate how the intrinsic heterogeneity of individual cell behaviors can be exploited to discover features of viral and host gene expression that correlate with single-cell outcomes, which will ultimately impact whether or not infections spread.""","""['Andrea C Timm', 'Jay W Warrick', 'John Yin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Integr Biol (Camb)""","""['Tools for Single-Cell Kinetic Analysis of Virus-Host Interactions.', 'Visualizing infection spread: dual-color fluorescent reporting of virus-host interactions.', 'High-Throughput Single-Cell Kinetics of Virus Infections in the Presence of Defective Interfering Particles.', 'Diverse mechanisms evolved by DNA viruses to inhibit early host defenses.', 'Identification and utility of innate immune system evasion mechanisms of ASFV.', 'Viro-fluidics: Real-time analysis of virus production kinetics at the single-cell level.', 'Single-Cell Infection of Influenza A Virus Using Drop-Based Microfluidics.', 'Virus-like Particles: Measures and Biological Functions.', 'Microfluidics in Single-Cell Virology: Technologies and Applications.', 'Pairing Microwell Arrays with an Affordable, Semiautomated Single-Cell Aspirator for the Interrogation of Circulating Tumor Cell Heterogeneity.']"""

Herein, by using paired normal and prostate cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts (CAFs) derived from a coculture cell model and clinical patient samples, we demonstrated that although CAFs promoted prostate cancer growth, matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) was lower in CAFs but elevated in prostate cancer cells relative to their normal counterparts. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide was characterized as the central modulator for altered MMP-3 expression in prostate cancer cells and CAFs, but through different regulatory mechanisms. Treatment of CAFs but not prostate cancer cells with hydrogen peroxide directly inhibited mmp-3 promoter activity with concomitant nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), indicating that NF-κB is the downstream pathway for the transcriptional repression of MMP-3 in CAFs. Hydrogen peroxide reduced thrombospondin 2 (an MMP-3 suppressor) expression in prostate cancer cells by upregulating microRNA-128.

Here, we characterize a compound that inhibits TAOK1 and TAOK2 activity with IC50 values of 11 to 15 nmol/L, is ATP-competitive, and targets these kinases selectively. TAOK inhibition or depletion in centrosome-amplified SKBR3 or BT549 breast cancer cell models increases the mitotic population, the percentages of mitotic cells displaying amplified centrosomes and multipolar spindles, induces cell death, and inhibits cell growth. In contrast, nontumorigenic and dividing bipolar MCF-10A breast cells appear less dependent on TAOK activity and can complete mitosis and proliferate in the presence of the TAOK inhibitor. We demonstrate that TAOK1 and TAOK2 localize to the cytoplasm and centrosomes respectively during mitosis. Live cell imaging shows that the TAOK inhibitor prolongs the duration of mitosis in SKBR3 cells, increases mitotic cell death, and reduces the percentages of cells exiting mitosis, whereas MCF-10A cells continue to divide and proliferate. Over 80% of breast cancer tissues display supernumerary centrosomes, and tumor cells frequently cluster extra centrosomes to avoid multipolar mitoses and associated cell death. Consequently, drugs that stimulate centrosome declustering and induce multipolarity are likely to target dividing centrosome-amplified cancer cells preferentially, while sparing normal bipolar cells. Our results demonstrate that TAOK inhibition can enhance centrosome declustering and mitotic catastrophe in cancer cells, and these proteins may therefore offer novel therapeutic targets suitable for drug inhibition and the potential treatment of breast cancers, where supernumerary centrosomes occur.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression stratified by study arm and age at vasectomy was performed.Results: There was an increased risk of prostate cancer in men who had undergone a vasectomy and were randomized to the usual care arm of the study (adjusted HR, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.20; P = 0.008).

We tested the hypothesis that circulating concentrations of sex steroid hormones reflect intraprostatic concentrations using serum and adjacent microscopically verified benign prostate tissue from prostate cancer cases.Methods: Incident localized prostate cancer cases scheduled for surgery were invited to participate. Consented participants completed surveys, and provided resected tissues and blood. Histologic assessment of the ends of fresh frozen tissue confirmed adjacent microscopically verified benign pathology. Sex steroid hormones in sera and tissues were extracted, chromatographically separated, and then quantitated by radioimmunoassays. Linear regression was used to account for variations in intraprostatic hormone concentrations by age, body mass index, race, and study site, and subsequently to assess relationships with serum hormone concentrations. Gleason score (from adjacent tumor tissue), race, and age were assessed as potential effect modifiers.Results: Circulating sex steroid hormone concentrations had low-to-moderate correlations with, and explained small proportions of variations in, intraprostatic sex steroid hormone concentrations. Androstane-3α,17β-diol glucuronide (3α-diol G) explained the highest variance of tissue concentrations of 3α-diol G (linear regression r2 = 0.21), followed by serum testosterone and tissue dihydrotestosterone (r2 = 0.10), and then serum estrone and tissue estrone (r2 = 0.09). There was no effect modification by Gleason score, race, or age.Conclusions: Circulating concentrations of sex steroid hormones are poor surrogate measures of the intraprostatic hormonal milieu.Impact: The high exposure misclassification provided by circulating sex steroid hormone concentrations for intraprostatic levels may partly explain the lack of any consistent association of circulating hormones with prostate cancer risk.

We aimed to demonstrate what imaging modalities can be used by descriptively reporting contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS), multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and grey-scale transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) results. Furthermore, we aimed to correlate quantitatively the ablation zone seen on mpMRI and CEUS with treatment planning to provide therapy feedback.  Methods:   Imaging data was obtained from two prospective multicenter trials on IRE for localized low- to intermediate-risk PCa. The ablation zone volume (AZV) seen on mpMRI and CEUS was 3D reconstructed to correlate with the planned AZV.  Results:   Descriptive examples are provided using mpMRI, TRUS, and CEUS for treatment planning and follow-up after IRE. The mean AZV on T2-weighted imaging 4 weeks following IRE was 12.9 cm3 (standard deviation [SD]=7.0), 5.3 times larger than the planned AZV. Linear regression showed a positive correlation (r=0.76, P = 0.002). For CEUS the mean AZV was 20.7 cm3 (SD=8.7), 8.5 times larger than the planned AZV with a strong positive correlation (r=0.93, P = 0.001). Prostate volume is reduced over time (mean= -27.5%, SD=11.9%) due to ablation zone fibrosis and deformation, illustrated by 3D reconstruction.  Conclusion:   The role of imaging in conjunction with IRE is of crucial importance to guide clinicians throughout the treatment protocol. CEUS and mpMRI may provide essential treatment feedback by visualizing the ablation zone dimensions and volume.""","""['Matthijs J Scheltema', 'Arnoud W Postema', 'Daniel M de Bruin', 'Mara Buijs', 'Marc R Engelbrecht', 'M Pilar Laguna', 'Hessel Wijkstra', 'Theo M de Reijke', 'Jean J M C H de la Rosette']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Diagn Interv Radiol""","""['MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging for evaluation of focal irreversible electroporation treatment: results from a phase I-II study in patients undergoing IRE followed by radical prostatectomy.', 'Percutaneous irreversible electroporation (IRE) of prostate cancer: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) findings during follow\xa0up.', 'Image-guided Irreversible Electroporation of Localized Prostate Cancer: Functional and Oncologic Outcomes.', 'Irreversible Electroporation for the Ablation of Prostate Cancer.', 'Why we should not routinely apply irreversible electroporation as an alternative curative treatment modality for localized prostate cancer at this stage.', 'Real-Time and Delayed Imaging of Tissue and Effects of Prostate Tissue Ablation.', 'Effectiveness and safety of irreversible electroporation for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma ineligible for thermal ablation after surgery.', 'MRI and CT in the follow-up after irreversible electroporation of small renal masses.', 'Prostate minimally invasive procedures: complications and normal vs. abnormal findings on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).', 'Irreversible electroporation ablation of end-stage metastatic retroperitoneal lesions: Report on three cases and literature review.']"""

Materials and methods:   Subjects were selected from among the 454 men in whom targeted biopsy proven prostate cancer was derived from regions of interest on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging from 2010 to 2016. Focal therapy eligibility was limited to a maximum Gleason score of 4 + 3 in regions of interest with or without other foci of low risk prostate cancer (Gleason score 3 + 3 and less than 4 mm). Men who did not meet NCCN® intermediate risk criteria were classified as ineligible for focal therapy. Of the 454 men 64 underwent radical prostatectomy and biopsy findings were compared to final pathology findings.  Results:   Of the 454 men with a biopsy proven region of interest 175 (38.5%) were eligible for focal therapy. Fusion biopsy, which combined targeted and template biopsy, had 80.0% sensitivity (12 of 15 cases), 73.5% specificity (36 of 49) and 75.0% accuracy (48 of 64) for focal therapy eligibility. Targeted cores alone yielded 73.3% sensitivity (11 of 15 cases), 47.9% specificity (23 of 48) and 54.7% accuracy (35 of 64). Gleason score and extension across the midline differed in 4 and 9, respectively, of the 13 cases that showed discordant biopsy and whole mount histology.  Conclusions:   Using intermediate risk eligibility criteria more than a third of men with a targeted biopsy proven lesion identified on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging would have been eligible for focal therapy. Eligibility determined by fusion biopsy was concordant with whole mount histology in 75% of cases. Improved selection criteria are needed to reliably determine focal therapy eligibility.""","""['Nima Nassiri', 'Edward Chang', 'Patricia Lieu', 'Alan M Priester', 'Daniel J A Margolis', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Frederick J Dorey', 'Leonard S Marks', 'Shyam Natarajan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Combination of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies is not enough for identifying patients eligible for hemiablative focal therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Index Tumor Detection: Correlation with Radical Prostatectomy Specimen.', 'Added Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Clinical Nomograms for Predicting Adverse Pathology in Prostate Cancer.', 'MR-guided biopsy and focal therapy: new options for prostate cancer management.', 'Targeted Prostate Biopsy in the Era of Active Surveillance.', 'Combination of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and transperineal template-guided mapping prostate biopsy to determine potential candidates for focal therapy.', 'Factors affecting the selection of eligible candidates for focal therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Focal Cryoablation of the Prostate: Primary Treatment in 163 Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy Enables Gleason Scoring of Prostate Core Needle Biopsy by a Convolutional Neural Network.', 'Value of magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy to select patients for focal therapy.']"""

The lncRNA ZEB1 antisense 1 (ZEB1-AS1) derives from the promoter region of ZEB1 and we still know little about its expressions, roles and mechanisms.  Methods:   RACE was used to obtain the sequence of ZEB1-AS1. RNA interference was used to decrease ZEB1-AS1 expression. Adenovirus expression vector was used to increase ZEB1-AS1 expression. CHIP and RIP were used to detect the epigenetic mechanisms by which ZEB1-AS1 regulated ZEB1. CCK8 assay, wound healing assay and transwell assay were used to measure proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells.  Results:   In this study, in prostate cancer cells, we found that RNAi-mediated downregulation of ZEB1-AS1 induced significant ZEB1 inhibition while artificial overexpression of ZEB1-AS1 rescued ZEB1 expression, which means that ZEB1-AS1 promotes ZEB1 expression. Also, ZEB1-AS1 indirectly inhibited miR200c, the well-known target of ZEB1, and upregulated miR200c's target BMI1. Mechanistically, ZEB1-AS1 bound and recruited histone methyltransferase MLL1 to the promoter region of ZEB1, induced H3K4me3 modification therein, and activated ZEB1 transcription. Biologically, ZEB1-AS1 promoted proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells.

Therefore, the identification of new molecular targets in cancer progression and development of novel therapeutic strategies to target them are very necessary for achieving better survival for patients with prostate cancer. Activation of small GTPases such as Ras and Arf1 is a critical component of the signaling pathways for most of the receptors shown to be upregulated in advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   The drug effects on cell proliferation were measured by CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay. The drug effects on cell migration and invasion were determined by Radius™ 24-well and Matrigel-coated Boyden chambers. The drug effects on apoptosis were assessed by FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit with 7-AAD and Western blot with antibodies against cleaved PARP and Caspase 3. A NOD/SCID mouse model generated by subcutaneous injection was used to assess the in vivo drug efficacy in tumor growth. ERK activation and tumor cell proliferation in xenografts were examined by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   We show that Exo2, a small-molecule inhibitor that reduces Arf1 activation, effectively suppresses prostate cancer cell proliferation by blocking ERK1/2 activation. Exo2 also has other effects, inhibiting migration and invasion of PCa cells and inducing apoptosis. The Ras inhibitor salirasib augments Exo2-induced cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells partially by enhancing the suppression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In a xenograft mouse model of prostate cancer, Exo2 reduces prostate tumor burden and inhibits ERK1/2 activation at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Synergistic treatment of salirasib and Exo2 exhibits a superior inhibitory effect on prostate tumor growth compared with either drug alone, which may be attributed to the more efficient inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation.  Conclusion:   This study suggests that simultaneous blockade of Arf1 and Ras activation in prostate cancer cells is a potential targeted therapeutic strategy for preventing prostate cancer development.""","""['Liwei Lang', 'Chloe Shay', 'Xiangdong Zhao', 'Yong Teng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Augmentation of the anticancer activity of CYT997 in human prostate cancer by inhibiting Src activity.', 'HRAS as a potential therapeutic target of salirasib RAS inhibitor in bladder cancer.', 'Salirasib inhibits the growth of hepatocarcinoma cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo through ras and mTOR inhibition.', 'Salirasib in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.', 'Signal transduction by Ras-like GTPases: a potential target for anticancer drugs.', 'GTPase Pathways in Health and Diseases.', 'ATAD3A mediates activation of RAS-independent mitochondrial ERK1/2 signaling, favoring head and neck cancer development.', 'Potentiating Therapeutic Effects of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Anti-allergic drug azelastine suppresses colon tumorigenesis by directly targeting ARF1 to inhibit IQGAP1-ERK-Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission.', 'Downregulation of long non-coding RNA LINC00460 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion, and promotes apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells via modulation of the miR-320b/ARF1 axis.']"""

Therefore, PSMA-PET is increasingly used for planning of radiotherapy treatment; however, any data on intermediate-term outcome is missing so far.  Methods:   Patients with high-risk or very high risk prostate cancer, referred for salvage radiotherapy (SRT, n = 22) between 2013 and 2015, underwent PSMA-PET prior to therapy. Irradiation was planned on PET data with boost to macroscopic tumors/metastases. Treatment related toxicity was measured using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, v4.0).  Result:   Findings in PSMA-PET led to treatment modifications in 77% of SRT patients compared to available CT information. One patient did not receive irradiation due to disseminated disease, the other patients received increased boost doses to macroscopic disease and/or inclusion of additional target volumes. Toxicity was low as only 2 patients reported toxicities > grade 1. With a Median follow-up time of 29 in patients that were not lost to follow-up, prolonged PSA responses below baseline were observed in the majority of patients (14 of 20). In hormone-naïve SRT patients (n = 11), radiotherapy led to prolonged PSA decrease in 8/11 patients, however with 3 of these 8 patients receiving repeated PSMA based irradiation of novel lesions during follow-up.  Conclusion:   PSMA-PET guided planning of radiotherapy led to change of treatment in the majority of patients.

Ideally, RG expression levels should remain constant in all cells, tissues or experimental conditions under study. Housekeeping genes traditionally fulfilled this requirement, but they have been reported to be less invariant than expected; therefore, RGs should be tested and validated for every particular situation. Microarray data have been used to propose new RGs, but only a limited set of model species and conditions are available; on the contrary, RNA-seq experiments are more and more frequent and constitute a new source of candidate RGs.  Results:   An automated workflow based on mapped NGS reads has been constructed to obtain highly and invariantly expressed RGs based on a normalized expression in reads per mapped million and the coefficient of variation. This workflow has been tested with Roche/454 reads from reproductive tissues of olive tree (Olea europaea L.), as well as with Illumina paired-end reads from two different accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana and three different human cancers (prostate, small-cell cancer lung and lung adenocarcinoma). Candidate RGs have been proposed for each species and many of them have been previously reported as RGs in literature. Experimental validation of significant RGs in olive tree is provided to support the algorithm.  Conclusion:   Regardless sequencing technology, number of replicates, and library sizes, when RNA-seq experiments are designed and performed, the same datasets can be analyzed with our workflow to extract suitable RGs for subsequent PCR validation. Moreover, different subset of experimental conditions can provide different suitable RGs.""","""['Rosario Carmona', 'Macarena Arroyo', 'María José Jiménez-Quesada', 'Pedro Seoane', 'Adoración Zafra', 'Rafael Larrosa', 'Juan de Dios Alché', 'M Gonzalo Claros']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biomed Eng Online""","""['Selection of suitable reference genes for accurate normalization of gene expression profile studies in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'LEMming: A Linear Error Model to Normalize Parallel Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR) Data as an Alternative to Reference Gene Based Methods.', 'Identification of reliable reference genes for quantitative gene expression studies in oral squamous cell carcinomas compared to adjacent normal tissues in the F344 rat model.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis of TCGA Data Revealed Promising Reference Genes for qPCR Normalization.', 'Identification and evaluation of reference genes for accurate gene expression normalization of fresh and frozen-thawed spermatozoa of water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis).', 'OliveAtlas: A Gene Expression Atlas Tool for Olea europaea.', 'The Botrytis cinerea Gene Expression Browser.', 'Identification of stably expressed reference genes for expression studies in Arabidopsis thaliana using mass spectrometry-based label-free quantification.', 'Investigation of chicken housekeeping genes using next-generation sequencing data.', 'RNA-Seq is not required to determine stable reference genes for qPCR normalization.']"""

Recent literature indicates AAM diagnosed with low-risk disease have increased pathologic upgrading and disease progression. We evaluated the surgical pathology of AAM and Caucasians who underwent prostatectomy to assess the suitability of AAM for AS. We retrospectively reviewed 1,034 consecutive men who underwent open prostatectomy between 2004 and 2015; 345 Caucasians and 58 AAM met the American Urological Association criteria for low-risk PC. We excluded from analysis two men whose prostatectomies were aborted. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used for statistical analysis. AAM with low-risk PC have a lower rate of surgical upgrading and similar rates of adverse pathology compared with Caucasians. 29.8% of AAM (17/57) diagnosed with low-risk disease but 44.5% of Caucasians (153/344) had disease upgrading at prostatectomy ( p < .04), although AAM overall were less likely to be clinically diagnosed with low-risk cancer (33.1 vs. 41.7%, p < .05). AAM with low-risk pathology were younger (median 55 vs. 59 years, p < .001) and had smaller prostates (32 vs. 35 g, p < .04). AAM with preoperative low-risk disease have lower rates of surgical upgrading and similar adverse pathology compared with Caucasians. There may be a Will-Rogers effect as AAM with aggressive disease appear more likely to be stratified into intermediate- and high-risk groups, leaving those AAM diagnosed with low-risk disease fully eligible for AS.

Methods:   This method uses a figure of merit based on the uncomplicated tumour control probability (P+) and the generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD). A set of doses per fraction is selected in order to find the dose per fraction and the total dose, thus maximizing the figure of merit and leading to a biologically effective dose that is similar to the prescribed schedule.  Results:   As a clinical example, a fractionation schedule for a prostate treatment plan is optimized and presented herein. From a prescription schedule of 70 Gy/35 × 2 Gy, the resulting optimal schema, using a figure of merit which only takes into account P+, is 54.4 Gy/16 × 3.4 Gy. If the gEUD is included in that figure of merit, the result is 65 Gy/26 × 2.5 Gy. Alternative schedules, which include tumour control probability (TCP) and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) values are likewise shown. This allows us to compare different schedules instead of solely finding the optimal value, as other possible clinical factors must be taken into account to make the best decision for treatment.  Conclusion:   The treatment schedule can be optimized for each patient through radiobiological analysis. The optimization process shown below offers physicians alternative schedules that meet the objectives of the prescribed radiotherapy.

A simple methodology for multimodal deformable image registration (DIR) of prostate cancer patients is presented.  Methods:   CT and mpMRI of 10 patients were considered. Organs at risk and prostate were contoured on both scans. The dominant intraprostatic lesion was additionally delineated on MRI. After a preliminary rigid image registration, the voxel intensity of all the segmented structures in both scans except the prostate was increased by a specific amount (a constant additional value, A), in order to enhance the contrast of the main organs influencing its position and shape. 70 couples of scans were obtained by varying A from 0 to 800 and they were subsequently non-rigidly registered. Quantities derived from image analysis and contour statistics were considered for the tuning of the best performing A.  Results:   A = 200 resulted the minimum enhancement value required to obtain statistically significant superior registration results. Mean centre of mass distance between corresponding structures decreases from 7.4 mm in rigid registration to 5.3 mm in DIR without enhancement (DIR-0) and to 2.7 mm in DIR with A = 200 (DIR-200). Mean contour distance was 2.5, 1.9 and 0.67 mm in rigid registration, DIR-0 and DIR-200, respectively.

JAA-F11 has potential, when humanized, for cancer immunotherapy for multiple cancer types. Humanization of JAA-F11, was performed utilizing complementarity determining regions grafting on a homology framework. The objective herein is to test the specificity, affinity and biology efficacy of the humanized JAA-F11 (hJAA-F11). Using a 609 target glycan array, 2 hJAA-F11 constructs were shown to have excellent chemical specificity, binding only to TF-Ag alpha-linked structures and not to TF-Ag beta-linked structures. The relative affinity of these hJAA-F11 constructs for TF-Ag was improved over the mouse antibody, while T20 scoring predicted low clinical immunogenicity. The hJAA-F11 constructs produced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in breast and lung tumor lines shown to express TF-Ag by flow cytometry. Internalization of hJAA-F11 into cancer cells was also shown using a surface binding ELISA and confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Both the naked hJAA-F11 and a maytansine-conjugated antibody (hJAA-F11-DM1) suppressed in vivo tumor progression in a human breast cancer xenograft model in SCID mice.

Methods:   This matched retrospective cohort study examined the effect of an encounter with palliative care on health-care use at the end of life among 6,580 Medicare beneficiaries with advanced prostate, breast, lung, or colorectal cancer. We compared health-care use before and after palliative care consultation to a matched nonpalliative care cohort.  Results:   The palliative care cohort had higher rates of health-care use in the 30 days before palliative care consultation compared with the nonpalliative cohort, with higher rates of hospitalization (risk ratio [RR], 3.33; 95% CI, 2.87 to 3.85), invasive procedures (RR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.62 to 1.88), and chemotherapy administration (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.45 to 1.78). The opposite pattern emerged in the interval from palliative care consultation through death, where the palliative care cohort had lower rates of hospitalization (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.44-0.65), invasive procedures (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.59), and chemotherapy administration (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.53). Patients with earlier palliative care consultation in their disease course had larger absolute reductions in health-care use compared with those with palliative care consultation closer to the end of life.  Conclusion:   This population-based study found that palliative care substantially decreased health-care use among Medicare beneficiaries with advanced cancer.

In the whole model, compared with subjects with low risk (reference category, decile 1), those carrying an intermediate risk (decile 5) had a 265% increase in PCa risk (OR = 3.65, 95% CI 2.26 to 5.91). The genetic risk score had an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.66 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.68). When adding the environmental score and family history to the genetic risk score, the AUROC increased by 0.05, reaching 0.71 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.74). Genetic susceptibility has a stronger risk value of the prediction that modifiable risk factors. While the added value of each SNP is small, the combination of 56 SNPs adds to the predictive ability of the risk model.""","""['Inés Gómez-Acebo', 'Trinidad Dierssen-Sotos', 'Pablo Fernandez-Navarro', 'Camilo Palazuelos', 'Víctor Moreno', 'Nuria Aragonés', 'Gemma Castaño-Vinyals', 'Jose J Jiménez-Monleón', 'Jose Luis Ruiz-Cerdá', 'Beatriz Pérez-Gómez', 'José Manuel Ruiz-Dominguez', 'Jessica Alonso Molero', 'Marina Pollán', 'Manolis Kogevinas', 'Javier Llorca']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Risk Model for Colorectal Cancer in Spanish Population Using Environmental and Genetic Factors: Results from the MCC-Spain study.', 'Genetic predisposition to early recurrence in clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Validating a breast cancer score in Spanish women.

This study evaluated public perceptions of widely used information on the concept to identify scope for improving communication methods.  Design:   Experimental survey carried out by a market research company via face-to-face computer-assisted interviews.  Setting:   Interviews took place in participants' homes.  Participants:   2111 members of the general public in England aged 18-70 years began the survey; 1616 were eligible for analysis. National representativeness was sought via demographic quota sampling.  Interventions:   Participants were allocated at random to receive a brief description of overdiagnosis derived from written information used by either the NHS Breast Screening Programme or the prostate cancer screening equivalent.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   The primary outcome was how clear the information was perceived to be (extremely/very clear vs less clear). Other measures included previous exposure to screening information, decision-making styles and demographic characteristics (eg, education). Binary logistic regression was used to assess predictors of perceived clarity.  Results:   Overdiagnosis information from the BSP was more likely to be rated as more clear compared with the prostate screening equivalent (adjusted OR: 1.43, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.75; p=0.001). Participants were more likely to perceive the information as more clear if they had previously encountered similar information (OR: 1.77, 1.40 to 2.23; p<0.0005) or a screening leaflet (OR: 1.35, 1.04 to 1.74; p=0.024) or had a more 'rational' decision-making style (OR: 1.06, 1.02 to 1.11; p=0.009).  Conclusions:   Overdiagnosis information from breast screening may be a useful template for communicating the concept more generally (eg, via organised campaigns).

We assessed long-term prostate specific antigen stability after low dose rate prostate brachytherapy and predictors of biochemical failure when prostate specific antigen was slowly rising below the nadir + 2 ng/ml threshold.  Materials and methods:   A total of 2,339 patients with low or intermediate risk prostate cancer received 125iodine brachytherapy from 1998 to 2010 with a minimum 3-year followup. In addition, 49.7% of the patients received 6 months of androgen deprivation. Clinical, dosimetric and prostate specific antigen data were retrieved from a prospective database. Biochemical results were classified as stable or rising prostate specific antigen (0.2 ng/ml or greater and increased 0.1 ng/ml or greater during the preceding 2 years), or biochemical failure (defined as nadir + 2). Multivariate analysis was done to identify predictors of failure used to create logistic regression models.  Results:   At a median followup of 89 months (range 37 to 199) prostate specific antigen was stable (nadir 0.03 ng/ml and at 60 months 0.04 ng/ml) in 2,004 patients (86%) and rising (nadir 0.16 ng/ml and at 60 months 0.29 ng/ml) in 145 (6%) while biochemical failure (nadir 0.51 ng/ml, p <0.001) was noted in 190 (8%). When there was no prior androgen deprivation therapy, the prostate specific antigen nadir and prostate specific antigen at 60 months were the strongest predictors of failure (OR 20.6 and 18.3, respectively, each p <0.0001). The logistic regression model had 85% sensitivity and 98% specificity, and predicted failure in 8 of 82 men (9.8%). A second model was created for the group with androgen deprivation therapy and rising prostate specific antigen using the predictive factors prostate specific antigen at 60 months (OR 53.9, p <0.0001) and T stage (OR 0.25, p = 0.0008). This model predicted biochemical failure in 30 of 56 men (54%) with 85% sensitivity and 93% specificity. The 2 predictive models yield an anticipated 90% cure rate in the entire cohort.

Materials and methods:   Patients were randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide 160 mg per day or bicalutamide 50 mg per day. Progression-free survival, time to prostate specific antigen progression and safety were analyzed post hoc in younger (age less than 75 years) and older (age 75 years or greater) subgroups.  Results:   Enzalutamide significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death vs bicalutamide in patients younger than 75 years (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27-0.52, p <0.0001) and 75 years old or older (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.92, p = 0.018). Time to prostate specific antigen progression was also significantly prolonged with enzalutamide vs bicalutamide in each subgroup. The adverse event distribution between treatments was similar in each subgroup except for more (5% or greater difference between subgroups) atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infections, falls and decreased appetite as well as less extremity pain and hot flushing in enzalutamide treated patients 75 years old or older, and less back pain and hot flushing in bicalutamide treated patients 75 years old or older. Grade 3 or greater cardiac events were more frequent in enzalutamide treated and bicalutamide treated patients who were 75 years old or older vs younger than 75 years.

Materials and methods:   To evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes of ARTA and docetaxel (DTX) as second-line treatment in the post first-line ARTA, we conducted a retrospective analysis of chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients who had received sequential treatment with ARTA followed by another ARTA (ARTA-ARTA) or ARTA followed by DTX (ARTA-DTX).  Results:   A total of 97 patients were treated with the ARTA-ARTA sequence and 42 with the ARTA-DTX sequence.

The median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly different between ARTA and DTX in the second-line treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.59; P < .001).

Here we found Enz might also increase some unwanted side-effects via increasing the CRPC cell invasion that might involve altering the Enz-mediated androgen receptor (AR)/EPHB6 suppressor/JNK signaling. Results from multiple clinical surveys also indicated that EPHP6 might function as a suppressor of PCa metastasis. Mechanism dissection revealed that Enz-mediated AR might function via binding to the androgen-response-element (ARE) on the EPHB6 promoter to decrease EPHB6 suppressor expression, which might then activate the phosphorylation of JNK signals to increase the CRPC cell invasion. Targeting this newly identified AR/EPHB6/JNK signaling with JNK inhibitor (SP600125) may then block/reverse the Enz-increased CRPC cell invasion.

The aim of the study was to assess the unknown dose-effect relationship for late patient-reported urinary incontinence (LPRUI).  Methods and materials:   Patients were enrolled within the multi-centric study DUE01. Clinical and dosimetry data including the prescribed 2Gy equivalent dose (EQD2) were prospectively collected. LPRUI was evaluated through the ICIQ-SF questionnaire filled in by the patients at RT start/end and therefore every 6months. Patients were treated with conventional (74-80Gy, 1.8-2Gy/fr) or moderately hypo-fractionated RT (65-75.2Gy, 2.2-2.7Gy/fr) in 5 fractions/week with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Six different end-points of 3-year LPRUI, including or not patient's perception (respectively, subjective and objective end-points), were considered. Multivariable logistic models were developed for each end-point.  Results:   Data of 298 patients were analyzed. The incidence of the most severe end-point (ICIQ-SF>12) was 5.1%. EQD2 calculated with alpha-beta=0.8Gy showed the best performance in fitting data: the risk of LPRUI markedly increased for EQD2>80Gy. Previous abdominal/pelvic surgery and previous TURP were the clinical factors more significantly predictive of LPRUI. Models showed excellent performances in terms of goodness-of-fit and calibration, confirmed by bootstrap-based internal validation. When included in the analyses, baseline symptoms were a major predictor for 5 out of six end-points.  Conclusions:   LPRUI after RT for PCa dramatically depends on EQD2 and few clinical factors. Results are consistent with a larger than expected impact of moderate hypo-fractionation on the risk of LPRUI.

Despite initial remission, CaP progresses while relying on AR. AR transcriptional output controls CaP behavior and is an alternative therapeutic target, but its molecular regulation is poorly understood. Here, we show that action of activated AR partitions into fractions that are controlled preferentially by different coregulators. In a 452-AR-target gene panel, each of 18 clinically relevant coregulators mediates androgen-responsiveness of 0-57% genes and acts as a coactivator or corepressor in a gene-specific manner. Selectivity in coregulator-dependent AR action is reflected in differential AR binding site composition and involvement with CaP biology and progression. Isolation of a novel transcriptional mechanism in which WDR77 unites the actions of AR and p53, the major genomic drivers of lethal CaP, to control cell cycle progression provides proof-of-principle for treatment via selective interference with AR action by exploiting AR dependence on coregulators.""","""['Song Liu#', 'Sangeeta Kumari#', 'Qiang Hu', 'Dhirodatta Senapati', 'Varadha Balaji Venkadakrishnan', 'Dan Wang', 'Adam D DePriest', 'Simon E Schlanger', 'Salma Ben-Salem', 'Malyn May Valenzuela', 'Belinda Willard', 'Shaila Mudambi', 'Wendy M Swetzig', 'Gokul M Das', 'Mojgan Shourideh', 'Shahriah Koochekpour', 'Sara Moscovita Falzarano', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Neelu Yadav', 'Xiwei Chen', 'Changshi Lao', 'Jianmin Wang', 'Jean-Noel Billaud', 'Hannelore V Heemers']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Elife""","""['Correction: A comprehensive analysis of coregulator recruitment, androgen receptor function and gene expression in prostate cancer.', 'Protein Kinase N1 control of androgen-responsive serum response factor action provides rationale for novel prostate cancer treatment strategy.', 'Bone stroma-derived cells change coregulators recruitment to androgen receptor and decrease cell proliferation in androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Rationale for the development of alternative forms of androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Cell-line and tissue-specific signatures of androgen receptor-coregulator transcription.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) coregulators: an overview.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Sex chromosome complement and sex steroid signaling underlie sex differences in immunity to respiratory virus infection.', 'Potent Stimulation of the Androgen Receptor Instigates a Viral Mimicry Response in Prostate Cancer.', 'LSD1/PRMT6-targeting gene therapy to attenuate androgen receptor toxic gain-of-function ameliorates spinobulbar muscular atrophy phenotypes in flies and mice.', 'Epigenetic Coregulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling.']"""

We estimated the cumulative incidence of metachronous (diagnosed >2months after first primary cancer [FPC]) SPC in gastric FPC patients and compared the incidence of metachronous SPC with that expected in the general population.  Methods:   A cohort of gastric FPC patients from the North Region Cancer Registry of Portugal, diagnosed in 2000-2006 (n=7427) was followed to 31 December 2010 for synchronous and metachronous SPCs. Cumulative incidence of metachronous SPCs taking into account death as a competing event and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) of metachronous SPCs were estimated.  Results:   Overall, 331 (4.5%) patients developed an SPC (26.9% synchronous and 73.1% metachronous). Over half of the SPCs occurred in digestive organs. Among men, the most frequent were colon, prostate, and trachea, bronchus and lung; in women, colon, breast and thyroid were the most common. The 10-year cumulative incidence of metachronous SPC for males was 5.7% and for females 3.5%. The SIR for all cancers was 1.30 in males and 1.20 in females. Among both sexes, significantly higher SIRs were observed for cancers of the oesophagus (males: 4.99; females: 8.03), small intestine (males: 11.04; females: 13.09) and colon (males: 2.42; females: 2.58).

Prevention efforts in this population have typically been through faith-based organizations and barber shops, with a few including significant others. Culturally, women are known to have a strong influence in the AA family. The current study assessed prostate cancer knowledge and explored perceptions on the roles of women in prostate cancer prevention.  Methods:   To assess prostate cancer knowledge, a 25-item questionnaire was administered to convenience samples of AA women (n = 297) and men (n = 199). Four focus groups were conducted to explore perceptions on the role of women in prostate cancer prevention.  Results:   Men had a higher mean score (13.2; max of 25) than women (11.4) for knowledge of prostate cancer. For the men, higher knowledge scores were associated with having a family member diagnosed with prostate cancer and likelihood to engage healthcare providers about prostate cancer (p < 0.05). Themes from the focus groups included education/information resource, support and encouragement, instituting a ""culture"" of regular primary care, modeling healthcare-seeking behavior, surveillance and monitoring, motivation, and influencing diet. The major barrier to women engaging in the roles identified was limited knowledge.  Conclusion:   Including women in educational interventions may yield added benefits particularly in encouraging AA men to seek regular primary care.

Materials and methods:   MCC-Spain (Multicase-Control Study on Common Tumors in Spain) is a population based, multicase-control study that was done in 7 Spanish provinces between September 2008 and December 2013. It collected anthropometric, epidemiological and dietary information on 754 histologically confirmed incident cases of prostate cancer and 1,277 controls 38 to 85 years old. Three previously identified dietary patterns, including Western, prudent and Mediterranean, were reconstructed using MCC-Spain data. The association of each pattern with prostate cancer risk was assessed by logistic regression models with random, province specific intercepts. Risk according to tumor aggressiveness (Gleason score 6 vs greater than 6) and extension (cT1-cT2a vs cT2b-cT4) was evaluated by multinomial regression models.  Results:   High adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern rich not only in fruits and vegetables but also in fish, legumes and olive oil was specifically associated with a lower risk of Gleason score greater than 6 prostate cancer (quartile 3 vs 1 relative RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.96 and quartile 4 vs 1 relative RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-1.01, p-trend = 0.023) or with higher clinical stage (cT2b-T4 quartile 4 vs 1 relative RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.96, p-trend = 0.024). This association was not observed with the prudent pattern, which combines vegetables and fruits with low fat dairy products, whole grains and juices. The Western pattern did not show any association with prostate cancer risk.  Conclusions:   Nutritional recommendations for prostate cancer prevention should consider whole dietary patterns instead of individual foods. We found important differences between the Mediterranean dietary pattern, which was associated with a lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer, and Western and prudent dietary patterns, which had no relationship with prostate cancer risk.""","""['Adela Castelló', 'Elena Boldo', 'Pilar Amiano', 'Gemma Castaño-Vinyals', 'Nuria Aragonés', 'Inés Gómez-Acebo', 'Rosana Peiró', 'Jose Juan Jimenez-Moleón', 'Juan Alguacil', 'Adonina Tardón', 'Lluís Cecchini', 'Virginia Lope', 'Trinidad Dierssen-Sotos', 'Lourdes Mengual', 'Manolis Kogevinas', 'Marina Pollán', 'Beatriz Pérez-Gómez;MCC-Spain Researchers']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Adherence to the Western, Prudent and Mediterranean dietary patterns and breast cancer risk: MCC-Spain study.', 'Low adherence to the western and high adherence to the mediterranean dietary patterns could prevent colorectal cancer.', 'High adherence to the Western, Prudent, and Mediterranean dietary patterns and risk of gastric adenocarcinoma: MCC-Spain study.', 'Mediterranean diet, monounsaturated: saturated fat ratio and low prostate cancer risk.

Materials and methods:   A total of 1052 men in their 40s were followed longitudinally for prostate outcomes, from 1990 to 2010. A random subset of 268 men was selected to undergo biennial CaP testing including PSA testing, transrectal ultrasound, and a digital rectal examination. A representative population of 609 men with a subset of 159 men who also began CaP testing in their 50s was also evaluated as a comparison group. Risk of prostate biopsy (PBx), CaP, or death from CaP was compared between CaP-tested and the routine-care population cohort.  Results:   Median follow-up was 17.2 years. Men aged 40-49, who underwent CaP testing were 2.4 times more likely to undergo a PBx (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-3.3) and 2.2 times more likely to be diagnosed with low-risk CaP (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.12-4.0). Those initiating CaP testing a decade earlier were 2.2 times and 1.7 times more likely to be biopsied and be diagnosed with CaP for any given age (HR 2.2 95% CI 1.4-3.5 and 1.7 95% CI 1.1-2.7, respectively).  Conclusion:   CaP testing in men beginning at age 40 resulted in a significant increase in the risk of PBx and diagnosis of low-risk CaP, without a measurable reduction in risk of CaP-death in this low-risk population. However, given the natural history of CaP, a longer follow-up is needed to confirm this finding.""","""['Christopher J Weight', 'Vikram M Narayan', 'Daniel Smith', 'Simon P Kim', 'R Jeffrey Karnes']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Early detection of high-grade prostate cancer using digital rectal examination (DRE) in men with a prostate-specific antigen level of <2.5 ng/mL and the risk of death.', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer Starting at Age 50-54 Years.

METHODS: Participants (N = 1508; 81% white; 12% black; 7% Hispanic; 50% surgery; 27% radiotherapy; 23% active surveillance) completed the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite measure of PCa-specific QOL prior to treatment, 6 weeks, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. We analyzed pretreatment differences in QOL with multivariable linear regression and post-treatment differences with generalized estimating equation models.  Results:   Blacks and Hispanics (compared with whites) and men with lower income had worse pretreatment urinary function; poorer and less educated men had worse pretreatment sexual function (P < .05). In adjusted models, among men treated surgically, blacks and Hispanics had worse bowel function compared with whites, and men with lower income experienced more sexual bother and slower recovery in urinary function. Not all racial or ethnic differences favored whites; blacks had higher sexual function than whites prior to surgery and improved faster after surgery. Blacks receiving radiotherapy had lower post-treatment bowel bother than whites (P < .05).  Conclusion:   Controlling for baseline QOL, there were some post-treatment disparities in urinary and sexual QOL that suggest the need to investigate whether treatment quality and access to follow-up care is equitable.

We assessed each patient's eligibility for each AS criterion with and without the inclusion of fusion biopsy cores. The primary end point was the proportion of men who were initially eligible for AS but became ineligible after addition of the fusion biopsy cores.  Results:   A total of 100 men were eligible for at least 1 AS criterion. After addition of fusion biopsy cores, the proportion of men who became ineligible for AS varied from 10.3% to 40.7%. Criteria that incorporated an absolute maximum number of cores positive had the highest rates of ineligibility. Using a percentage of cores positive helped to reduce the number of patients who would have been excluded. Combining the targeted biopsy cores into one, or taking the single core with the highest grade or volume did not appear to reduce the proportion of men who became ineligible.  Conclusions:   The addition of fusion biopsy to standard 12-core biopsy significantly increased the number of men who became ineligible for AS. Using the percent of cores positive, instead of an absolute number, allowed fewer exclusions.

Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in men in Iowa, surpassed only by non-melanotic skin cancer. Epidemiology studies have evaluated arsenic exposure from drinking water and prostate cancer, but most have focused on high-level exposures outside the US. As drinking water from groundwater sources is a major source of arsenic exposure, we conducted an ecologic study to evaluate prostate cancer and arsenic in drinking water from public water sources and private wells in Iowa, where exposure levels are low, but duration of exposure can be long. Arsenic data from public water systems were obtained from the Iowa Safe Drinking Water Information System for the years 1994-2003 and for private wells from two Iowa Well Water Studies, the Iowa Community Private Well Study (ICPWS, 2002-2003) and Iowa Statewide Rural Well Water Survey Phase 2 (SWIRL2, 2006-2008) that provided data for 87 Iowa counties. Prostate cancer incidence data from 2009 to 2013 for Iowa were obtained from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results' SEER*Stat software. County averages of water arsenic levels varied from 1.08 to 18.6 ppb, with three counties above the current 10 ppb limit. Based on the tertiles of arsenic levels, counties were divided into three groups: low (1.08-2.06 ppb), medium (2.07-2.98 ppb), and high (2.99-18.6 ppb). Spatial Poisson regression modeling was conducted to estimate the risk ratios (RR) of prostate cancer by tertiles of arsenic level at a county level, adjusted for demographic and risk factors. The RR of prostate cancer were 1.23 (95% CI, 1.16-1.30) and 1.28 (95% CI, 1.21-1.35) in the medium and high groups, respectively, compared to the low group after adjusting for risk factors. The RR increased to 1.36 (95% CI, 1.28-1.45) in the high group when analyses were restricted to aggressive prostate cancers (Gleason score ≥ 7). This study shows a significant dose-dependent association between low-level arsenic exposure and prostate cancer, and if this result is replicated in future individual-level studies, may suggest that 10 ppb is not protective for human health.""","""['Taehyun Roh', 'Charles F Lynch', 'Peter Weyer', 'Kai Wang', 'Kevin M Kelly', 'Gabriele Ludewig']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Environ Res""","""['Prostate Cancer Incidence in U.S. Counties and Low Levels of Arsenic in Drinking Water.', 'Arsenic in drinking water and prostate cancer in Illinois counties: An ecologic study.', 'Relationships between arsenic concentrations in drinking water and lung and bladder cancer incidence in U.S. counties.', 'Dose-response for assessing the cancer risk of inorganic arsenic in drinking water: the scientific basis for use of a threshold approach.', 'Lessons Learned from Arsenic Mitigation among Private Well Households.', 'Relations between personal exposure to elevated concentrations of arsenic in water and soil and blood arsenic levels amongst people living in rural areas in Limpopo, South Africa.', 'Polyadenylation of canonical histone H3.1 in carcinogenesis.', 'Stem Cells as Target for Prostate cancer Therapy: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Arsenic Speciation and Metallomics Profiling of Human Toenails as a Biomarker to Assess Prostate Cancer Cases: Atlantic PATH Cohort Study.', 'Why We Will Continue to Lose Our Battle with Cancers If We Do Not Stop Their Triggers from Environmental Pollution.']"""

Methods Data from demographics, survival, diagnoses codes, procedure codes, and other information about beneficiaries age 67 years or older in the Medicare claims database was assessed to determine the unadjusted and adjusted risks of AD and of dementia from ADT. The prespecified survival analysis method was competing risk regression. Results Of the 1.2 million fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who developed prostate cancer in 2001 to 2014, 35% received ADT. Of these, 109,815 (8.9%) and 223,765 (18.8%) developed AD and dementia, respectively, and 26% to 33% died without either outcome. Unadjusted rates of AD and all-cause mortality per 1,000 patient-years were higher among ADT recipients; the unadjusted rates of AD were 17.0 and 15.5 per 1,000 person-years in recipients and nonrecipients, respectively, and the unadjusted rates of all-cause mortality were 73.0 and 51.6 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. The unadjusted rates for dementia in ADT recipients versus nonrecipients were 38.5 and 32.9, respectively, and the unadjusted rates of mortality were 60.2 versus 40.4, respectively. However, after analysis was adjusted for other cancer therapies and other covariates, patients with ADT treatment had no increased risk of AD (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97 to 0.99) and had only a miniscule (1%) risk of dementia (SHR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.02); patients treated with ADT were more likely to die before progression to AD (SHR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.24) or dementia (SHR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.26). The risks of AD and dementia were not associated with duration of ADT (ie, no dose effect). Other secondary analyses confirmed these results.

Fully dynamic PET may improve accuracy but scan protocols suitable for routine clinical use are warranted. A modeling study proposed that hypoxia specificity can be improved by a clinically feasible blood-flow normalization procedure that only requires a 10- to 15-min dynamic scan (perfusion), followed by a short late static scan, but experimental validation is desired.  Methods:   Tumor-bearing mice were administered pimonidazole (hypoxia marker) and the PET hypoxia-tracer 18F-azomycin arabinoside (FAZA) and scanned for 3h. Subsequently, the distributions of FAZA (autoradiography) and hypoxic cells (pimonidazole) were compared on tissue sections. PET images collected in 10-min time intervals between 60 and 90 min post-injection (PETearly), which mimics the image contrast seen in patients, were compared voxel-by-voxel to 3-h PET (PETlate). For comparison, PETearly was normalized to the perfusion peak area, deduced from the first 10 min of the scan (PETperf), and the resulting parameter PETearly/PETperf was compared with PETlate.  Results:   Tissue analysis revealed a near-perfect spatial match between FAZA signal and hypoxic cell density (pimonidazole) 3 h post-injection, regardless of the tumor type. Only a weak inverse or no correlation between PETperf and PETlate was seen, and the correlation between PETearly/PETperf and PETlate proved inferior to the correlation between PETearly and PETlate.  Conclusions:   Late PET scans in rodents, unlike patients, provide an accurate map of hypoxia against which earlier time-point scans can be compared. PETearly and PETlate correlated to a variable extent but the correlation was lowered by normalization to perfusion (PETearly/PETperf). Our study challenges the validity/robustness of a perfusion normalization approach.

The focus was on the issues that were common to three key stakeholder groups. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders in North East Scotland: 12 individuals with kidney, bladder or prostate cancer, 10 healthcare providers and 10 managers from large organisations. Five key themes emerged from the Framework Analysis: perceived importance of work engagement; decision-making: treatment, work and cancer; roles and responsibilities; education and training; information, advice and support resources. The data confirmed that work engagement is important to those with urological cancer. It also made clear that the current provision of information and advice could be improved.

Topoisomerases trapping on the DNA is the mode of action of several anticancer drugs, it lead to formation of protein linked DAN breaks (PDBs). PDBs are now considered as one of the most dangerous forms of endogenous DNA damage and a major threat to genomic stability. The repair of PDBs involves both the sensing and repair pathways. Unsuccessful repair of PDBs leads to different signs of genomic instabilities such as chromosomal rearrangements and cancer predisposition.

Methods:   We retrospectively identified treatment-naïve pathology-proven peripheral zone PC patients who underwent 3T prostate MRI, using high b-value diffusion-weighted imaging from 2011 to 2015. Using 3D slicer, areas of suspected tumor (T) and normal tissue (N) on ADC (b = 0, 1400) were outlined volumetrically. Mean ADCT, mean ADCN, ADCratio (ADCT/ADCN) were calculated. PI-RADSv2 was assigned. Three csPC definitions were used: (A) Gleason score (GS) ≥ 4 + 3; (B) GS ≥ 3 + 4; (C) MRI-based tumor volume >0.5 cc. Performances of ADC parameters and PI-RADSv2 in identifying csPC were measured using nonparametric comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves using the area under the curve (AUC).  Results:   Eighty five cases met eligibility requirements. Diagnostic performances (AUC) in identifying csPC using three definitions were: (A) ADCT (0.83) was higher than PI-RADSv2 (0.65, p = 0.006); (B) ADCT (0.86) was higher than ADCratio (0.68, p < 0.001), and PI-RADSv2 (0.70, p = 0.04); (C) PI-RADSv2 (0.73) performed better than ADCratio (0.56, p = 0.02). ADCT performance was higher when csPC was defined by A or B versus C (p = 0.038 and p = 0.01, respectively). ADCratio performed better when csPC was defined by A versus C (p = 0.01). PI-RADSv2 performance was not affected by csPC definition.  Conclusions:   When csPC was defined by GS, ADC parameters provided better csPC discrimination than PI-RADSv2, with ADCT providing best result.

We reviewed our experience using low-dose-rate (LDR) or high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy to compare the outcome and toxicity profiles of each approach in the salvage brachytherapy setting.  Methods and materials:   Ninety-eight patients with biopsy-proven locally recurrent prostate cancer who underwent salvage brachytherapy (LDR = 37; HDR = 61) following an initial course of definitive radiotherapy between 4/2003 and 4/2015 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent salvage brachytherapy using LDR or HDR. Androgen deprivation therapy was used in 45% of the patients. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure was determined using the Phoenix (nadir+2) definition. Toxicity was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 and patient-reported questionnaires.  Results:   Median followup was 31 months. The 3-year PSA relapse-free survival (RFS) was 60.1% (95% CI, 49.6-72.5%). There was no difference between LDR and HDR brachytherapy in terms of PSA RFS (p = 0.84 by log-rank test). On multivariate analysis, only prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) <12 months was significantly associated with PSA relapse. The 3-year PSA RFS for patients with a PSADT <12 months was 39% compared with 73% for PSADT ≥12 months (p = 0.002 by long-rank test). There were no statistically significant differences in toxicity between LDR and HDR brachytherapy. There was a higher peak in urinary symptoms in LDR patients; however by 24-36 months, most patients in both groups returned to baseline.  Conclusions:   Both LDR and HDR salvage brachytherapy are an excellent treatment options for appropriately selected patients with comparable outcome and toxicity.

We present an adapted modular training system which purpose to optimize the learning curve and perform a safe surgery.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis of the LRP safe learning protocol applied during a fellowship program over eight years (2008-2015). The surgery was divided in 12 steps and 5 levels of difficulty. A maximum time interval was stipulated in 240 minutes. After an adaptation, the fellows had 120 minutes to perform all the corresponding modules to its accumulated skill. The participants gradually and safely pass through the steps and difficulty levels. Surgeries performed by fellows were analyzed as a single group and compared to a prior series performed by tutor.  Results:   In eight years, 250 LRP were performed (25 per apprentice) during fellowship program and 150 procedures after completion. The baseline characteristics were comparable. Most cases operated were of intermediate risk. Mean operative time was longer in the fellow group when compared to the tutor (150 min). Mean estimated blood loss were similar among the groups. Functional and oncological outcomes were better in the Tutor´s group. No conversion to open surgery was performed.  Conclusions:   The LRP safe learning protocol proved to be an effective method to optimize the learning curve and perform safe surgery. However, the tutor's functional and oncological results were better, showing that this is a procedure with a steep learning curve and proficiency demands more than 25 cases.""","""['Marcos Tobias-Machado', 'Cristiano Linck Pazeto', 'Oseas Castro Neves-Neto', 'Igor Nunes-Silva', 'Hamilton de Campos Zampolli']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Evaluating the learning curve of experienced laparoscopic surgeons in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Preliminary results of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) after fellowship training and experience in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP).', 'Impact of a low-volume laparoscopic radical prostatectomy learning curve on perioperative outcomes: is it acceptable?', 'Oncological and functional results of open, robot-assisted and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: does surgical approach and surgical experience matter?', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy a review of the literature and comparison with open techniques.', 'LAPAROSCOPIC RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY: SINGLE CENTER CASE SERIES.', 'Beforehand transection and suturing (BTS) of the dorsal vascular complex: a novel technique in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.']"""

A 78-year-old transgender woman was admitted with genital discomfort and neovaginal discharge. The patient's history revealed male-to-female gender confirmation surgery with construction of a neovagina by penile and scrotal skin inversion at 33 years of age. Physical examination of the genitalia revealed presence of fecal material, suggestive of recto-neovaginal fistula. A biopsy specimen was positive for well-differentiated HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a bulky mass in the posterior wall of the neovagina that infiltrated the urethra, prostatic gland and the anterior rectal wall. Following a multidisciplinary evaluation, we performed a definitive sigmoid colostomy and administered chemotherapy. Long-term follow-up seems advisable in patients after vaginoplasty due to the possibility of delayed development of cancer.

Little is reported about the association between predischarge outcomes and postdischarge outcomes following RARP. The objective of this study was to explore the predischarge predictors of readmissions and postdischarge complications in RARP.  Materials and methods:   The National Surgery Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was used to identify prostate cancer patients who underwent elective RARP from 2012 to 2014. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess potential predischarge predictors of readmissions and NSQIP-defined postdischarge complications within 30 days of RARP. To test the robustness of primary analysis, a secondary multivariable logistic regression was performed in the cohort of patients without any NSQIP-defined predischarge complications.  Results:   A total of 9975 patients were included. The readmission rate in the cohort was 3.3% (n = 332), and 4.4% (n = 441) had at least one complication. Multivariable logistic regression showed that American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3-4 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00-1.62, p = 0.050), increasing operative time (OT, per minute) (OR = 1.002, 95% CI = 1.000-1.003, p = 0.012), increasing length of hospital stay (LOS, per day) (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.23-1.49, p < 0.001), and predischarge complication (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.27-3.65, p = 0.004) were associated with readmission. Increasing OT (OR = 1.002, 95% CI = 1.001-1.004, p = 0.002) and increasing LOS (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.02-1.30, p = 0.020) were associated with postdischarge complications. Logistic regression in patients without predischarge complications (n = 9804) confirmed that ASA score of 3-4 (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.07-1.75, p = 0.013), increasing OT (OR = 1.002, 95% CI = 1.000-1.003, p = 0.022), and increasing LOS (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.21-1.49, p < 0.001) were associated with readmissions. Secondary analyses also confirmed that increasing OT (OR = 1.002, 95% CI = 1.001-1.004, p = 0.002) and increasing LOS (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.04-1.34, p = 0.011) were associated with postdischarge complications.  Conclusions:   Predischarge complications, OT, and LOS are associated with readmissions and postdischarge complications after RARP. It may be possible to identify patients at a higher risk of postdischarge adverse events to direct prevention interventions.

The aim of this study was to determine the association between a novel urinary biomarker-based risk score (SelectMDx), multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) outcomes, and biopsy results for PCa detection.  Methods:   This retrospective observational study used data from the validation study of the SelectMDx score, in which urine was collected after digital rectal examination from men undergoing prostate biopsies. A subset of these patients also underwent a mpMRI scan of the prostate. The indications for performing mpMRI were based on persistent clinical suspicion of PCa or local staging after PCa was found upon biopsy. All mpMRI images were centrally reviewed in 2016 by an experienced radiologist blinded for the urine test results and biopsy outcome. The PI-RADS version 2 was used.  Results:   In total, 172 patients were included for analysis. Hundred (58%) patients had PCa detected upon prostate biopsy, of which 52 (52%) had high-grade disease correlated with a significantly higher SelectMDx score (P < 0.01). The median SelectMDx score was significantly higher in patients with a suspicious significant lesion on mpMRI compared to no suspicion of significant PCa (P < 0.01). For the prediction of mpMRI outcome, the area-under-the-curve of SelectMDx was 0.83 compared to 0.66 for PSA and 0.65 for PCA3. There was a positive association between SelectMDx score and the final PI-RADS grade. There was a statistically significant difference in SelectMDx score between PI-RADS 3 and 4 (P < 0.01) and between PI-RADS 4 and 5 (P < 0.01).  Conclusions:   The novel urinary biomarker-based SelectMDx score is a promising tool in PCa detection. This study showed promising results regarding the correlation between the SelectMDx score and mpMRI outcomes, outperforming PCA3. Our results suggest that this risk score could guide clinicians in identifying patients at risk for significant PCa and selecting patients for further radiological diagnostics to reduce unnecessary procedures.""","""['Rianne J Hendriks', 'Marloes M G van der Leest', 'Siebren Dijkstra', 'Jelle O Barentsz', 'Wim Van Criekinge', 'Christina A Hulsbergen-van de Kaa', 'Jack A Schalken', 'Peter F A Mulders', 'Inge M van Oort']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Clinical use of the SelectMDx urinary-biomarker test with or without mpMRI in prostate cancer diagnosis: a prospective, multicenter study in biopsy-naïve men.', 'Risk-based Patient Selection for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsy after Negative Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Random Biopsy Avoids Unnecessary Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans.', 'Prospective assessment of two-gene urinary test with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate for men undergoing primary prostate biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Accuracy of SelectMDx compared to mpMRI in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis.', 'Molecular Biomarkers for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'A SelectMDx/magnetic resonance imaging-based nomogram to diagnose prostate cancer.', 'Combination of PI-RADS score and mRNA urine test-A novel scoring system for improved detection of prostate cancer.', 'Biomarkers for prostate cancer detection and risk stratification.', 'Comparative Analysis of PSA Density and an MRI-Based Predictive Model to Improve the Selection of Candidates for Prostate Biopsy.']"""

Abiraterone acetate (AA) therapy is associated with toxicities, including hypokalemia, hypertension, liver function test abnormalities and cardiac events. These adverse events are traditionally managed with a standard dose of corticosteroids. However, preliminary data are available on the use of a lower dose of corticosteroids. The aim of this report is to perform a pooled analysis evaluating the risk ratio (RR) of AA-related adverse events of special interest associated with low or standard dose of corticosteroids. A total of 5374 cases from 4 randomized clinical trials were included. Subgroup analysis according to corticosteroids dosage revealed a higher RR of adverse events associated with a dose of 5 mg, compared to 10 mg. In particular, there was a statistically significant higher RR of hypokalemia and ALT/AST increase, and only a modest risk increase for cardiac disorders and hypertension. In conclusion, given the limitations of a literature-based study, in comparison with a meta-analysis based on individual patients' data, our study identified a relatively small increase in RR for hypertension and cardiac disorders and a bigger increase of RR for hypokalemia and ALT/AST toxicity when 5 mg, rather than 10 mg of corticosteroids were administered to manage adverse events of special interest from AA.

Materials and methods:   In this study, compounds from the leaves and bark of this plant were isolated and tested for their cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction in two human cancer cell lines (hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and colorectal carcinoma (Caco-2)) and a non-cancer cell line (embryonic kidney (HEK293)). GC-MS profiling of the extract was also conducted.  Results:   Three compounds (β-sitosterol, β-amyrin and β-sitosterol-3-O-glucoside) were isolated and the cytotoxic activity of β-amyrin and β-sitosterol-3-O-glucoside on the HepG2, Caco-2 and HEK293 was determined using the MTT cell viability assay. Both compounds had significant cytotoxic activity towards the Caco-2 cell line with IC50 values of 81 μg mL-1 and 54 μg mL-1 for β-amyrin and β-sitosterol-3-O-glucoside, respectively while low cytotoxicity was observed on HepG2 cell lines with IC50 values of 206 μg mL-1 and 251 μg mL-1 for β-amyrin and β-sitosterol-3-O-glucoside, respectively. Apoptosis induction in cells was studied using acridine orange/ethidium bromide dual staining. In both cases, the compounds tested demonstrated selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells with high apoptosis indices in cells exposed to β-amyrin. Low IC50 values of 156 μg mL-1 and 937 μg mL-1 for β-amyrin and β-sitosterol-3-O-glucoside, respectively, were observed in the HEK293 cell line.

A differential gene expression study was conducted using biopsies from CaP and BPH patients to identify the components putatively responsible for reinstating AR activity in CaP. From the set of genes upregulated in CaP, FKBP52, an AR co-chaperone, was selected for further analysis. Expression of FKBP52 was positively correlated with that of c-Myc. The functional cross-talk between c-Myc and FKBP52 was established using c-Myc specific-siRNA to LNCaP cells that resulted in reduction of FKBP52. A non-canonical E-box sequence housing a putative c-Myc binding site was detected on the FKBP4 promoter using in silico search. LNCaP cells transfected with the FKBP52 promoter cloned in pGL3 basic showed increased luciferase activity which declined considerably when the promoter-construct was co-transfected with c-Myc specific-siRNA. ChIP-PCR confirmed the binding of c-Myc with the conserved E-box located in the FKBP52 promoter. c-Myc downregulation concomitantly affected expression of FGF8.

Objective:   To assess the long-term effects of active surveillance (AS) and/or watchful waiting (WW) on psychological and quality-of-life outcomes for low-risk localised prostate cancer patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Prostate Cancer Care and Outcome Study is a population-based prospective cohort study in New South Wales, Australia. Participants for these analyses were low-risk localised prostate cancer patients aged <70 yr at diagnosis and participated in the 10-yr follow-up.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Validated instruments assessed outcomes relating to six health-related quality-of-life and nine psychological domains relevant to prostate cancer patients. Adjusted mean differences (AMDs) in outcome scores between prostate cancer treatment groups were estimated using linear regression.  Results and limitations:   At 9-11 yr after diagnosis, patients who started AS/WW initially had (1) higher levels of distress and hyperarousal than initial radiation/high-dose-rate brachytherapy patients (AMD=5.9; 95% confidence interval or CI [0.5, 11.3] and AMD=5.4; 95% CI [0.2, 10.5], respectively), (2) higher levels of distress and avoidance than initial low-dose-rate brachytherapy patients (AMD=5.3; 95% CI [0.2, 10.3] and AMD=7.0; 95% CI [0.5, 13.5], respectively), (3) better urinary incontinence scores than initial radical prostatectomy patients (AMD=-9.1; 95% CI [-16.3, -2.0]), and (4) less bowel bother than initial radiation/high-dose-rate brachytherapy patients (AMD=-16.8; 95% CI [-27.6, -6.0]). No other significant differences were found. Limitations include participant attrition, inability to assess urinary voiding and storage symptoms, and nonrandom treatment allocation.  Conclusions:   Notwithstanding some long-term differences between AS/WW and various active treatment groups in terms of distress, hyperarousal, avoidance, urinary incontinence, and bowel bother, most long-term outcomes were similar between these groups.  Patient summary:   This study assessed the long-term psychological and quality-of-life impacts of initially monitoring rather than actively treating low-risk prostate cancer.

One argument for considering surgery rather than active surveillance is that the probability of postoperative recovery of erectile function is age dependent, that is, patients who delay surgery may lose the window of opportunity to recover erectile function after surgery.  Objective:   To model erectile function over a 10-yr period for immediate surgery versus active surveillance.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data from 1103 men who underwent radical prostatectomy at a tertiary referral center were used.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-6) pre- and postoperatively as a routine part of clinical care. Preoperative IIEF-6 scores were plotted against age to assess the natural rate of functional decline due to aging. Reported erectile scores in the 2-yr period following surgery were used to assess post-surgical recovery.  Results and limitations:   Each year increase in patient age resulted in a 0.27 reduction in IIEF scores. In addition to IIEF reducing with increased age, the amount of erectile function that is recovered from presurgery to 12-mo postsurgery also decreases (-0.16 IIF points/yr, 95% confidence interval -0.27, -0.05, p=0.006). However, delayed radical prostatectomy increased the mean IIEF-6 score over a 10-yr period compared with immediate surgery (p=0.001), even under the assumption that all men placed on active surveillance are treated within 5 yr.  Conclusions:   Small differences in erectile function recovery in younger men are offset by a longer period of time living with decreased postoperative function. Better erectile recovery in younger men should not be a factor used to recommend immediate surgery in patients suitable for active surveillance, even if crossover to surgery is predicted within a short period of time.  Patient summary:   Younger men have better recovery of erectile function after surgery for prostate cancer. This has led to the suggestion that delaying surgery for low-risk disease may lead patients to miss a window of opportunity to recover erectile function postoperatively. We conducted a modeling study and found that predicted erectile recovery was far superior on delayed treatment because slightly better recovery in younger men is offset by a longer period of time living with poorer postoperative function in those choosing immediate surgery.""","""['Justin K Lee', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Mariam Imnadze Miller', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'John P Mulhall', 'Behfar Ehdaie']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Erectile Function Recovery After Surgery in Young Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Probably Not Just a Matter of Age, Certainly Not the Main Point of Discussion.', 'Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Recovery of Baseline Erectile Function in Men Following Radical Prostatectomy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Analysis Using Validated Measures.', 'Effects of tadalafil treatment on erectile function recovery following bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a randomised placebo-controlled study (REACTT).', 'Penile Rehabilitation Therapy Following Radical Prostatectomy: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Predicting erectile function outcome in men after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of Sarcopenia on Erectile Function after Nerve-Sparing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Active surveillance of prostate cancer : An update.', 'The Early Use of Vacuum Therapy for Penile Rehabilitation After Radical Prostatectomy: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Here, we evaluate the activity of darolutamide in enzalutamide-resistant castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as well as in AR mutants detected in patients after treatment with enzalutamide, abiraterone, or bicalutamide. Darolutamide significantly inhibited cell growth and AR transcriptional activity in enzalutamide-resistant MR49F cells in vitro, and led to decreased tumor volume and serum prostate-specific antigen levels in vivo, prolonging survival in mice bearing enzalutamide-resistant MR49F xenografts. Moreover, darolutamide inhibited the transcriptional activity of AR mutants identified in the plasma of CRPC patients progressing on traditional therapies. In particular, darolutamide significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the F877L, H875Y/T878A, F877L/T878A, and the previously unreported T878G AR mutants, that transform enzalutamide into a partial agonist. In silico cheminformatics computer modeling provided atomic level insights confirming darolutamide antagonist effect in F877L and T878G AR mutants.

The study aimed to clinically evaluate the detection rate of prostate cancer on transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy and analyze its characteristics among the northern Han Chinese population at a single center.  Methods:   Between October 2009 and September 2016, a total of 1027 Chinese men, who had undergone TRUS-guided prostate biopsy at Qingdao Municipal Hospital, were retrospectively analyzed. Prostate biopsies were performed in the case of an abnormally elevated serum PSA level, and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, and/or suspicious prostatic imaging findings.  Results:   Of the 1022 men enrolled in the analysis, 438 patients (42.8%) were diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma histologically. When serum PSA levels were divided into five subgroups (less than 4.0, 4.0 to 10.0, 10.0 to 20.0, 20.0 to 100.0, and ≥ 100.0 ng/ml), the detection rates of prostate cancer were 12.4, 15.9, 34.1, 66.2, and 93.8%, respectively. With serum PSA levels of 4.0 to 10.0 ng/ml, the cancer detection rates for a normal DRE and a suspect DRE finding were 13.5 and 58.2%, respectively. Accordingly, the cancer detection rates for a normal imaging and a suspect imaging finding were 13.5 and 58.2%, respectively.

Herein, we aimed to determine the presence of key ghrelin-system components (native-ghrelin, In1-ghrelin, GHSR1a/1b) and their potential pathophysiological role in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   In1-ghrelin and native-ghrelin expression was evaluated by qPCR in prostate tissues from patients with high PCa-risk (n = 52; fresh-tumoral biopsies), and healthy-prostates (n = 12; from cystoprostatectomies) and correlated with clinical parameters using Spearman-test. In addition, In1-ghrelin and native-ghrelin was measured in plasma from an additional cohort of PCa-patients with different risk levels (n = 30) and control-healthy patients (n = 20). In vivo functional (proliferation/migration) and mechanistic (gene expression/signaling-pathways) assays were performed in PCa-cell lines in response to In1-ghrelin and native-ghrelin treatment, overexpression and/or silencing. Finally, tumor progression was monitored in nude-mice injected with PCa-cells overexpressing In1-ghrelin, native-ghrelin and empty vector (control).  Results:   In1-ghrelin, but not native-ghrelin, was overexpressed in high-risk PCa-samples compared to normal-prostate (NP), and this expression correlated with that of PSA. Conversely, GHSR1a/1b expression was virtually absent. Remarkably, plasmatic In1-ghrelin, but not native-ghrelin, levels were also higher in PCa-patients compared to healthy-controls. Furthermore, In1-ghrelin treatment/overexpression, and to a much lesser extent native-ghrelin, increased aggressiveness features (cell-proliferation, migration and PSA secretion) of NP and PCa cells. Consistently, nude-mice injected with PC-3-cells stably-transfected with In1-ghrelin, but not native-ghrelin, presented larger tumors. These effects were likely mediated by ERK1/2-signaling activation and involved altered expression of key oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes. Finally, In1-ghrelin silencing reduced cell-proliferation and PSA secretion from PCa cells.  Conclusions:   Altogether, our results indicate that In1-ghrelin levels (in tissue) and circulating levels (in plasma) are increased in PCa where it can regulate key pathophysiological processes, thus suggesting that In1-ghrelin may represent a novel biomarker and a new therapeutic target in PCa.""","""['Daniel Hormaechea-Agulla', 'Manuel D Gahete', 'Juan M Jiménez-Vacas', 'Enrique Gómez-Gómez', 'Alejandro Ibáñez-Costa', 'Fernando L-López', 'Esther Rivero-Cortés', 'André Sarmento-Cabral', 'José Valero-Rosa', 'Julia Carrasco-Valiente', 'Rafael Sánchez-Sánchez', 'Rosa Ortega-Salas', 'María M Moreno', 'Natia Tsomaia', 'Steve M Swanson', 'Michael D Culler', 'María J Requena', 'Justo P Castaño', 'Raúl M Luque']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Ghrelin and Cancer: Examining the Roles of the Ghrelin Axis in Tumor Growth and Progression.', 'In1-Ghrelin Splicing Variant as a Key Element in the Pathophysiological Association Between Obesity and Prostate Cancer.', 'In1-ghrelin, a splice variant of ghrelin gene, is associated with the evolution and aggressiveness of human neuroendocrine tumors: Evidence from clinical, cellular and molecular parameters.', 'The oncogenic role of the spliced somatostatin receptor sst5TMD4 variant in prostate cancer.', 'Ghrelin and prostate cancer.', 'Somatostatin, Cortistatin and Their Receptors Exert Antitumor Actions in Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells: Critical Role of Endogenous Cortistatin.', 'Ghrelin and Cancer: Examining the Roles of the Ghrelin Axis in Tumor Growth and Progression.', 'Dysregulation of the miRNome unveils a crosstalk between obesity and prostate cancer: miR-107 asa personalized diagnostic and therapeutic tool.', 'Sarcopenia and Ghrelin System in the Clinical Outcome and Prognosis of Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.', 'GHSR methylation-dependent expression of a variant ligand and receptor of the ghrelin system induces thymoma tumorigenesis.']"""

The effect of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists on adrenal androgens has not been studied sufficiently. We measured testicular and adrenal androgen levels in patients treated with a GnRH antagonist.  Methods:   This study included 47 patients with histologically proven prostate cancer. All of the patients were treated with the GnRH antagonist degarelix. The mean patient age was 73.6 years. Pre-treatment blood samples were collected from all of the patients, and post-treatment samples were taken at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after starting treatment. Testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 17β-estradiol (E2), and androstenedione (A-dione) were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were measured by electro-chemiluminescence immunoassays.  Results:   A significant reduction in T level (97.3% reduction) was observed in the patients 1 month after initiating treatment. In addition, levels of DHT, E2, DHEA-S, and A-dione decreased 1 month after initiating treatment (93.3, 84.9, 16.8, and 35.9% reduction, respectively).

In vivo thrombosis and anticoagulation might be involved in tumor growth and progression. We studied the association of warfarin and other anticoagulant use as antithrombotic medication and prostate cancer (PCa) death in men with the disease.  Methods:   The study included 6,537 men diagnosed with PCa during 1995-2009. Information on anticoagulant use was obtained from a national reimbursement registry. Cox regression with adjustment for age, PCa risk group, primary therapy and use of other medication was performed to compare risk of PCa death between warfarin users with 1) men using other types of anticoagulants and 2) non-users of anticoagulants. Medication use was analyzed as a time-dependent variable to minimize immortal time bias.  Results:   In total, 728 men died from PCa during a median follow-up of 9 years. Compared to anticoagulant non-users, post-diagnostic use of warfarin was associated with an increased risk of PCa death (overall HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13-1.93). However, this was limited to low-dose, low-intensity use. Otherwise, the risk was similar to anticoagulant non-users. Additionally, we found no risk difference between warfarin and other types of anticoagulants. Pre-diagnostic use of warfarin was not associated with the risk of PCa death.  Conclusions:   We found no reduction in risk of PCa death associated with warfarin use. Conversely, the risk was increased in short-term use, which is probably explained by a higher risk of thrombotic events prompting warfarin use in patients with terminal PCa.""","""['Pete T T Kinnunen', 'Teemu J Murtola', 'Kirsi Talala', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Anticoagulants and cancer mortality in the Finnish randomized study of screening for prostate cancer.', 'Warfarin use and prostate cancer risk in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Recurrent venous thromboembolism in anticoagulated patients with cancer: management and short-term prognosis.', 'Long-term anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism: duration of treatment and management of warfarin therapy.', 'Duration of anticoagulant therapy for patients with venous thromboembolism.', 'The impact of warfarin on overall survival in cancer patients.', 'Survival outcomes with warfarin compared with direct oral anticoagulants in cancer-associated venous thromboembolism in the United States: A population-based cohort study.', 'Overall survival with warfarin vs. low-molecular-weight heparin in cancer-associated thrombosis.', 'Anticoagulants and cancer mortality in the Finnish randomized study of screening for prostate cancer.', 'Single-cell Wnt signaling niches maintain stemness of alveolar type 2 cells.']"""

However, interpreting mp-MRI data which typically contains multiple unregistered 3D sequences, e.g. apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2w) images, is time-consuming and demands special expertise, limiting its usage for large-scale PCa screening. Therefore, solutions to computer-aided detection of PCa in mp-MRI images are highly desirable. Most recent advances in automated methods for PCa detection employ a handcrafted feature based two-stage classification flow, i.e. voxel-level classification followed by a region-level classification. This work presents an automated PCa detection system which can concurrently identify the presence of PCa in an image and localize lesions based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) features and a single-stage SVM classifier. Specifically, the developed co-trained CNNs consist of two parallel convolutional networks for ADC and T2w images respectively. Each network is trained using images of a single modality in a weakly-supervised manner by providing a set of prostate images with image-level labels indicating only the presence of PCa without priors of lesions' locations. Discriminative visual patterns of lesions can be learned effectively from clutters of prostate and surrounding tissues. A cancer response map with each pixel indicating the likelihood to be cancerous is explicitly generated at the last convolutional layer of the network for each modality. A new back-propagated error E is defined to enforce both optimized classification results and consistent cancer response maps for different modalities, which help capture highly representative PCa-relevant features during the CNN feature learning process. The CNN features of each modality are concatenated and fed into a SVM classifier. For images which are classified to contain cancers, non-maximum suppression and adaptive thresholding are applied to the corresponding cancer response maps for PCa foci localization. Evaluation based on 160 patient data with 12-core systematic TRUS-guided prostate biopsy as the reference standard demonstrates that our system achieves a sensitivity of 0.46, 0.92 and 0.97 at 0.1, 1 and 10 false positives per normal/benign patient which is significantly superior to two state-of-the-art CNN-based methods (Oquab et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015) and 6-core systematic prostate biopsies.""","""['Xin Yang', 'Chaoyue Liu', 'Zhiwei Wang', 'Jun Yang', 'Hung Le Min', 'Liang Wang', 'Kwang-Ting Tim Cheng']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Automated diagnosis of prostate cancer in multi-parametric MRI based on multimodal convolutional neural networks.', 'Automated Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in mp-MRI Images Based on an End-to-End Deep Neural Network.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'A deep dive into understanding tumor foci classification using multiparametric MRI based on convolutional neural network.', 'Computer-aided Detection of Prostate Cancer with MRI: Technology and Applications.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'Three-dimensional convolutional neural network model to identify clinically significant prostate cancer in transrectal ultrasound videos: a prospective, multi-institutional, diagnostic study.', 'Does deep learning software improve the consistency and performance of radiologists with various levels of experience in assessing bi-parametric prostate MRI?', 'CROPro: a tool for automated cropping of prostate magnetic resonance images.', 'Predicting clinically significant prostate cancer with a deep learning approach: a multicentre retrospective study.']"""

Estrogenic signaling pathways may stimulate the induction of EMT. However, the details of estradiol (E2) and estrogen receptors (ERs) effects on EMT, as well as E2-induced modulation of benign prostatic epithelial cell phenotype in vitro have not been completely clarified.  Methods:   The effects of E2 on EMT markers and cytokeratins (CKs) expression were evaluated in benign epithelial cell lines BPH-1 and RWPE-1, which were cultured both in two-dimensional (2D) culture and three-dimensional (3D) culture model using hanging drop technique or 3D Matrigel model. ER antagonist, ICI182,780, was used to confirm the regulatory effects of E2 on EMT and phenotypic modulation. In 3D culture, immunohistochemical stainings were performed to detect the specific phenotype of cells that underwent EMT in acinar-like spheroids formed by RWPE-1. To illustrate the exact function of ERs in E2-induced EMT and phenotypic modulation, specific short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and agonists were used to knockdown or activate individual ERs, respectively.  Results:   E2-induced EMT was observed both in 2D and 3D culture, with related regulation of EMT markers expression at both mRNA and protein level. In addition, E2 down-regulated luminal cell type markers CK18 and CK8 and up-regulated basal cell type markers CK5 and CK14. E2 also increased intermediate type markers CK15 and CK17, while it attenuated CK19 in 3D culture. ICI182,780 blocked E2-induced EMT and cell phenotypic switching. In 3D Matrigel culture, Vimentin was co-expressed with ERα and CK17, as well as with SMemb, which is related to cell status switching and proliferation. Knockdown of ERα but not GPR30 inhibited EMT, while ERβ knockdown facilitated EMT process. Knockdown of ERα blocked E2-induced EMT both in RWPE-1 and BPH-1. MRNA expression of EMT markers was stimulated by ERα-specific agonist PPT and inhibited by ERβ-specific agonist DPN.  Conclusions:   Estrogenic effect mediated by ERα can promote EMT. E2 is also an inductive factor of cell phenotypic switching. Cell type modulation is associated with E2-induced EMT in benign prostatic epithelial cells.

The majority of this population can be treated effectively with analgesics following the Guidelines of the original World Health Organisation (WHO). Unfortunately 10-15% of these patients still suffer from severe and refractory cancer pain, especially in the terminal phases of disease and require additional pain management modalities. Therefore, end-stage clinical interventions are particularly needed to minimize the perception of pain. With intrathecal therapy (ITT), drugs are delivered close to their site of action in the central nervous system avoiding first-pass metabolism and blood-brain barrier. It may improve analgesia with a smaller dose and possibly achieve a reduction in systemic or cerebral side effects compared to oral supplied medication alone. Multimodal analgesia enables further dose reduction with improved analgesia and fewer side effects.  Methods:   In this retrospective research we investigated the effectiveness and side-effect profile of intrathecal morphine, bupivacaine and clonidine. Patients were followed until death occurred. Pain scores and side effects were recorded before initiating ITT (T0), just after initiating ITT (T1), at hospital discharge (T2), in the ambulant setting (T3) and the last obtained scores before death occurred (T4).  Results:   Nine patients were included who suffered from severe and refractory cancer pain, not reacting to conventional pain management or had intolerable side effects. Primary tumour location was pancreatic (4), urothelial (3) and prostate (2). Primary pain was considered neuropathic or mixed neuropathic-nociceptive. The treatment team consisted of an anaesthetist, specialized nurse in coordination with primary physician, treating oncologist and specialized home care. All patients were free of pain after initiation of the intrathecal therapy. The average follow-up period was 11 weeks in which there was a slight increase in NRS-score. In the last days before death occurred, half the patients were still free of pain. There were no problems during insertion of the catheter, device malfunction or infection. No severe adverse events defined as hypotension requiring inotropes, respiratory depression or neurological deficits were observed. Three patients experienced mild hypotension which gradually decreased after clonidine dose adjustment. Lower extremity weakness occurred in three patients as well. After bupivacaine dose adjustment the weakness disappeared in two patients and in one patient the lower extremity weakness persisted as a result of conus compression by tumour.  Conclusion and implications:   Multimodal IT treatment with morphine, bupivacaine and clonidine is effective and safe for treating refractory cancer pain in the terminal phase of disease. The study offers an important contribution to literature where there is still lack of convincing evidence about the benefits and harms of this type of pain management in patients with otherwise refractory cancer pain.""","""['Thierry C Mastenbroek', 'Bianca J Kramp-Hendriks', 'Jan Willem Kallewaard', 'Johanna M Vonk']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Scand J Pain""","""['Cancer-pain intractable to high-doses systemic opioids can be relieved by intraspinal local anaesthetic plus an opioid and an alfa2-adrenoceptor agonist.', 'Terminal cancer pain intractable by conventional pain management can be effectively relieved by intrathecal administration of a local anaesthetic plus an opioid and an alfa2-agonist into the cerebro-spinal-fluid.', 'Spinal analgesia for severe cancer pain: A retrospective analysis of 60 patients.', 'The control of severe cancer pain by continuous intrathecal infusion and patient controlled intrathecal analgesia with morphine, bupivacaine and clonidine.', 'Continuous infusion of opioid and bupivacaine by externalized intrathecal catheters in long-term treatment of ""refractory"" nonmalignant pain.', 'Intrathecal drug administration in chronic pain syndromes.', 'Opioids and the management of chronic severe pain in the elderly: consensus statement of an International Expert Panel with focus on the six clinically most often used World Health Organization Step III opioids (buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone).', 'Comparison of external system and implanted system in intrathecal therapy for refractory cancer pain in China: A retrospective study.', 'The Options for Neuraxial Drug Administration.', 'Effectiveness of collaboration between oncology pharmacists and anaesthesiologists for inpatient cancer pain management: A pilot study in Taiwan.', 'Interventional Therapies for Pain in Cancer Patients: a Narrative Review.', 'Intrathecal Morphine Infusion Therapy via a Percutaneous Port for Refractory Cancer Pain in China: An Efficacy, Safety and Cost Utilization Analysis.']"""

Neurotensin receptor binding affinity was evaluated using cell binding assay. The imaging profile of radiolabeled probes was compared in well-established NTR+ HT-29 tumor model. Stability of the probes was tested. The selected agents were further evaluated in human prostate cancer PC3 xenografts.  Results:   All 3 NT conjugates retained the majority of NTR binding affinity. In HT-29 tumor, all agents demonstrated prominent tumor uptake. Although comparable stability was observed, 64Cu-NOTA-NT and 64Cu-AmBaSar-NT demonstrated improved tumor to background contrast compared with 64Cu-DOTA-NT. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of the NTR expression in PC-3 xenografts showed high tumor uptake of the probes, correlating with the in vitro Western blot results. Blocking experiments further confirmed receptor specificity.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrated that 64Cu-labeled neurotensin analogs are promising imaging agents for NTR-positive tumors.

Aberrant activation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been exhibited to be one of the most common causes of treatment failure and death in cancer patients. In cancer cells with metastatic competence, the E-cadherin switch is a well-established hallmark. Suppression of E-cadherin through its transcriptional repressor SNAIL is thus a determining factor for EMT. TWIST1 is an important transcription factor in EMT, which is present under both physiologic (embryogenesis) and pathologic (metastasis) conditions, and enhances the invasiveness and migration ability of cells. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of taurine on EMT-related genes, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, TWIST1, ZEB1, SNAIL, and vimentin.

Our objective was to explore the association between cancer incidence and the socioeconomic level of the residence area in the French West Indies.  Methods:   Cancer incidence data were obtained from the cancer registries of Guadeloupe and Martinique (2009-2010). To assess socioeconomic status, we developed a specific index of social deprivation from census data at a small area level. We used Bayesian methods to evaluate the association between cancer incidence and the deprivation index, for all cancers combined and for the major cancer sites.  Results:   There was no clear association between area-based deprivation and the incidence of all cancers combined. In men, higher area deprivation was associated with a higher incidence of prostate cancer (relative risk (RR) 1.25, 95% credible interval (CI) 1.04-1.49; RR 1.08, CI 0.91-1.29 in the categories of intermediate and high deprivation, respectively, compared to low deprivation), but was not associated with respiratory cancer. Women living in the most deprived areas had a higher incidence of stomach (RR 1.77, CI 1.12-2.89), breast (RR 1.15, CI 0.90-1.45), and cervical (RR 1.13, CI 0.63-2.01) cancers and a lower incidence of respiratory cancer (RR 0.65, CI 0.38-1.11).

Methods:   Data was obtained from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS). Study variables were assessed using ICD-9 codes on adults aged 40 years and over admitted to a US hospital between 2007 and 2011 with primary diagnosis of either breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer. We examined in-hospital mortality, post-surgical complications, and discharge disposition among cancer patients with MetS and compared with non-MetS patients.

Methods:   Within Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (2001-2013), we identified 57,700 patients with T1-2 N0 M0 RCC. Logistic regression and competing-risks regression models tested the effect of marital status and gender on stage, tumor grade, treatment type and cancer specific mortality (CSM).

The present study demonstrated that silencing of TBX2 by TBX2 small interfering RNA inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell senescence. It was demonstrated that knockdown of TBX2 inhibited cell metastatic abilities by upregulating E‑cadherin and downregulating N‑cadherin, Vimentin and fibronectin. In addition, the expression of TBX2 in prostate cancer tissues and tumor adjacent tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. The results indicated that the expression rates of TBX2 were significantly increased in the cancerous tissues, compared with the healthy tumor adjacent tissue, and TBX2 increased staining was associated with the clinical stage and pathological grade.

The present study aimed to investigate the significance of the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion in human prostate cancers using bioinformatics tools. Comprehensive alteration analysis of TMPRSS2 and ERG in 148 different human cancer studies was performed by cBioPortal, and the mRNA expression level of the ERG gene was evaluated using Oncomine analysis. Furthermore, lentiviral short hairpin (sh)RNA‑mediated knockdown of TMPRSS2:ERG was performed to study the impact of ERG silencing on cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution in prostate cancer cells. The results demonstrated that the TMPRSS2 and ERG genes were mostly altered in prostate cancer, and the most frequent alteration was gene fusion. Oncomine analysis demonstrated that the ERG gene was significantly upregulated in prostate clinical samples compared with the normal prostate gland in four independent datasets, and a positive association was observed between potassium inwardly‑rectifying channel subfamily J member 15, down syndrome critical region gene 4, potassium inwardly‑rectifying channel subfamily J member 6 and ERG gene expression. There were 272 mutations of the ERG gene identified in the cBioPortal database; among the mutations, 2 missense mutations (R367C and P401H) were regarded as functional mutations (functional impact score >1.938). Furthermore, the present study successfully knocked down ERG gene expression through a lentiviral‑mediated gene silencing approach in VCaP prostate cancer cells. The ERG mRNA and protein expression levels were both suppressed significantly, and a cell‑cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase was observed after ERG gene silencing. In conclusion, these bioinformatics analyses provide novel insights for TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene study in prostate cancer. Target inhibition of ERG expression could significantly cause cell growth arrest in prostate cancer cells, which could be a potentially valuable target for prostate cancer treatment. However, the precise mechanism of these results remains unclear; therefore, further studies are required.""","""['Zhu Wang', 'Yuliang Wang', 'Jianwen Zhang', 'Qiyi Hu', 'Fan Zhi', 'Shengping Zhang', 'Dengqi Mao', 'Ying Zhang', 'Hui Liang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Prevalence and clinical application of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in Asian prostate cancer patients: a large-sample study in Chinese people and a systematic review.', 'TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene expression alters chemo- and radio-responsiveness in cell culture models of androgen independent prostate cancer.', 'Micro-RNA-204 Participates in TMPRSS2/ERG Regulation and Androgen Receptor Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.', 'Characterization and evaluation of gene fusions as a measure of genetic instability and disease prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic value of E‑26 transformation‑specific‑related gene in prostate cancer based on immunohistochemistry analysis.', 'Association Between ERG/PTEN Genes and Pathologic Parameters of Prostate Cancer With an Emphasis on Gleason Score: A Literature Review.', 'Anti-HERV-K Drugs and Vaccines, Possible Therapies against Tumors.']"""

The circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that chrysophanol nanoparticles effectively resulted in conformational alterations in DNA and regulated different proteins associated with cell cycle arrest. The reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA damage, Cyto-c and caspase-3 activity were analyzed, and the expression levels of different anti- and pro-apoptotic were studied using immunoblotting analysis. The cytotoxicity assay suggested that chrysophanol nanoparticles preferentially killed prostate cancer cells in comparison to the normal cells. Chrysophanol nanoparticles reduced histone deacetylases (HDACs) to suppress cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by arresting the cell cycle in sub-G phase. In addition, the cell cycle-related proteins, including p27, CHK1, cyclin D1, CDK1, p-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p-protein kinase B (AKT), were regulated by chrysophanol nanoparticles to prevent human prostate cancer cell progression. Chrysophanol nanoparticles induced apoptosis in LNCap cells by promoting p53/ROS crosstalk to prevent proliferation. Pharmacokinetic study in mice indicated that chrysophanol nanoparticle injection showed high bioavailability compared to the free chrysophanol.

This suggested that a better local control could be obtained, without any toxicity increase. Consequently, two types of hypofractionated schemes were proposed: ""moderate"" hypofractionation, with fractions of 2.5 to 4Gy, and ""extreme"" hypofractionation, utilizing stereotactic techniques, with fractions of 7 to 10Gy. For moderate hypofractionation, the linear-quadratic (LQ) model has been used to calculate the equivalent doses of the new protocols. The available trials have often shown a ""non-inferiority"", but no advantage, while the equivalent doses calculated for the hypofractionated arms were sometimes very superior to the doses of the conventional arms. This finding could suggest either an alpha/beta ratio lower than previously calculated, or a negative impact of other radiobiological parameters, which had not been taken into account. For ""extreme"" hypofractionation, the use of the LQ model is discussed for high dose fractions. Moreover, a number of radiobiological questions are still pending. The reduced overall irradiation time could be either a positive point (better local control) or a negative one (reduced reoxygenation). The prolonged duration of the fractions could lead to a decrease of efficacy (because allowing for reparation of sublethal lesions). Finally, the impact of the large fractions on the microenvironment and/or immunity remains discussed. The reported series appear to show encouraging short to mid-term results, but the results of randomized trials are still awaited. Today, it seems reasonable to only propose those extreme hypofractionated schemes to well-selected patients, treating small volumes with high-level stereotactic techniques.""","""['J-M Cosset']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Radiother""","""['Radiobiology of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy: what are the optimal fractionation schedules?', 'A systematic review of hypofractionation for primary management of prostate cancer.', 'Hypofractionated radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Hypofractionation and radiotherapy: ""the eternal return"".', 'The minimal FLASH sparing effect needed to compensate the increase of radiobiological damage due to hypofractionation for late-reacting tissues.']"""

A connection between GDF15 and body-weight regulation was initially suggested on the basis of an observation that increasing GDF15 levels in serum correlated with weight loss in individuals with advanced prostate cancer. In animal models, overexpression of GDF15 leads to a lean phenotype, hypophagia and other improvements in metabolic parameters, suggesting that recombinant GDF15 protein could potentially be used in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the signaling and mechanism of action of GDF15 are poorly understood owing to the absence of a clearly identified cognate receptor. Here we report that GDNF-family receptor α-like (GFRAL), an orphan member of the GFR-α family, is a high-affinity receptor for GDF15. GFRAL binds to GDF15 in vitro and is required for the metabolic actions of GDF15 with respect to body weight and food intake in vivo in mice. Gfral-/- mice were refractory to the effects of recombinant human GDF15 on body-weight, food-intake and glucose parameters. Blocking the interaction between GDF15 and GFRAL with a monoclonal antibody prevented the metabolic effects of GDF15 in rats. Gfral mRNA is highly expressed in the area postrema of mouse, rat and monkey, in accordance with previous reports implicating this region of the brain in the metabolic actions of GDF15 (refs. 4,5,6).

The TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion is the most frequently observed genetic aberration in prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to elucidate the intrafocal heterogeneity of ERG gene fusion status.  Methods:   ERG immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed in samples from 168 prostate cancer patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy, and 40 cases showing ERG-positive IHC staining were selected for tissue microarray (TMA) construction. Two to six representative cores were selected from each tumor focus. In the cases with heterogeneous ERG IHC staining intensity, the areas showing different intensities were separately selected. Using the TMA blocks, IHC and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were conducted to evaluate the heterogeneity of ERG protein expression and ERG fusion gene patterns, respectively, in a single tumor focus. Heterogeneity of ERG IHC staining was defined as the simultaneous presence of negative and positive cores in the same tumor focus. Heterogeneity of ERG FISH was defined by the presence of cores with positive and negative FISH signals or cores with break-apart and interstitial deletion FISH signals in the same tumor focus.  Results:   A total of 202 TMA cores were isolated from 40 ERG-positive cases. Of the 202 total cores, 19 were negative for ERG IHC staining, and 46 showed 1+, 52 showed 2+, and 85 showed 3+ ERG staining intensity. Eleven cores were negative for ERG FISH signal, 119 cores showed ERG break-apart FISH signals, and the remaining 72 cores revealed interstitial deletion. Intrafocal heterogeneity of ERG IHC staining was found in 20% (8/40) of cases, and intrafocal heterogeneity of ERG gene fusion pattern was found in 32.5% (13/40) of cases.  Conclusions:   In summary, this study showed significantly frequent intrafocal heterogeneity of ERG protein expression, gene fusion status and fusion pattern.

In this study, we aimed to explore the regulating role of PSCA gene expression in interleukin-6 (IL-6) autocrine of PCa cells.  Methods:   The stable knockdown-PSCA and ectopically overexpressed-PSCA vector were constructed and transfected into human PCa DU145 and PC-3M cells. The effects of PSCA overexpression or knockdown were determined in proliferation, invasion, and metastasis assays. The effect of PSCA on the expression and secretion of IL-6 was evaluated by immunoblotting and ELISA. Subcellular localization and expression pattern of PSCA and IL-6 protein were examined by immunohistochemistry. Its clinical significance was statistically analyzed.  Results:   The results showed that stable knockdown of PSCA delayed proliferation, migration, and invasion while overexpressing PSCA enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and the lung metastasis in vivo of PCa cells. Importantly, the PSCA involved in the IL-6 secretion and positively regulated p38/NF-κB/IL-6 signaling, leading to enhanced PCa cell invasion and metastasis. Both the expression of PSCA and IL-6 were significantly associated with poor biochemical recurrence-free survival of patients with PCa. PSCA protein expression showed a prognostic value in overall survival as indicated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Methods and materials:   Data from 624 consecutive patients who received LDR-BT for localized prostate cancer between 2002 and 2012 at a single institution were collected for various patient, disease, and treatment characteristics including a 4-8 week postimplant PSA (4-8wkPSA). Subgroup analysis was stratified by risk category and treatment regimen. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs), and receiver-operator characteristic curves.  Results:   A total of 624 consecutive patients were included with followup time of 4.0 ± 3.1 years. Predictors of bFFS included PSA nadir and 4-8wkPSA (HR = 2.48, p = 0.000 and HR = 1.24, p = 0.000, respectively) for total population.

Despite over-whelming evidence of cadmium causing carcinogenicity in humans, the specific underlying molecular mechanisms that govern metal-induced cellular transformation remain unclear. Acute exposure (up to 72 h) to cadmium induces apoptosis in normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1), while chronic exposure (>1 year) transforms these cells to a malignant phenotype (cadmium-transformed prostate epithelial cells; CTPE). Increased expression of autophagy-regulated genes; Plac8, LC3B and Lamp-1; in CTPE cells was associated with cadmium-induced transformation. Increased expression of Plac8, a regulator of autophagosome/autolysosome fusion, facilitates the pro-survival function of autophagy and upregulation of pAKT(ser473) and NF-κβ, to allow CTPE to proliferate. Likewise, inhibition of Plac8 suppresses CTPE cell growth. Additionally, overexpression of Plac8 in RWPE-1 cells induces resistance to cadmium toxicity. Pharmacological inhibitors and an inducer of autophagy failed to affect Plac8 expression and CTPE cell viability, suggesting a unique role for Plac8 in cadmium-induced prostate epithelial cell transformation.

Materials and methods:   Forty patients (mean age: 73.1 ± 7.5 years; average Gleason score: 7 ± 1; average prostate-specific antigen: 14.7 ± 11.6 ng/mL) underwent MR and computed tomography imaging before fiducial-based IMRT. MR protocol included SWAN, T2-weighted (T2w) and diffusion-weighted imaging in a first group (n = 20) and SWAN, T2w and T2-star weighted imaging in a second group (n = 20). In group 1, the depiction of fiducials, image sharpness and visibility of prostate boundaries were independently evaluated by 2 readers on SWAN, T2w or diffusion-weighted images. In group 2, a similar evaluation was performed by 2 other readers on SWAN and T2-star images only. Depiction of fiducials was compared to computed tomography findings.  Results:   The median scores of visibility of prostate boundaries, image sharpness and depiction of fiducials by SWAN were above average to excellent for all readers.

Retrospective analyses suggest some cross-resistance between these two drugs when used sequentially, but robust, prospective studies have not yet been reported.  Objective:   To fulfil a regulatory postregistration commitment by evaluating the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who progressed following abiraterone acetate plus prednisone treatment.  Design, setting, and participants:   Multicentre, single-arm, open-label study, enrolled patients with progressing mCRPC after ≥24 wk of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone treatment. All patients maintained castration therapy during the trial. Prior chemotherapy was allowed but not required.  Intervention:   Patients received enzalutamide 160mg/d orally.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was radiographic progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, and time-to-PSA progression. Safety data were also assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to descriptively analyse time-to-event endpoints.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 214 patients received enzalutamide treatment, 145 of whom were chemotherapy-naïve. Median radiographic progression-free survival was 8.1 mo (95% confidence interval: 6.1-8.3); median overall survival had not been reached. Unconfirmed PSA response rate was 27% (48 of 181). Median time-to-PSA progression was 5.7 mo (95% confidence interval: 5.6-5.8). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were fatigue (32%), decreased appetite (25%), asthenia (18%), back pain (17%), and arthralgia (16%). No seizures were reported.  Conclusions:   Enzalutamide showed antitumour activity in some patients with mCRPC who had previously progressed following ≥24 wk of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone treatment.

However, there are no randomized trials or consensus regarding the optimal follow-up strategy.  Objective:   To compare life expectancy and quality of life between watchful waiting (WW) versus different strategies of active surveillance (AS).  Design, setting, and participants:   A Markov model was created for US men starting at age 50, diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who chose conservative management by WW or AS using different testing protocols (prostate-specific antigen every 3-6 mo, biopsy every 1-5 yr, or magnetic resonance imaging based). Transition probabilities and utilities were obtained from the literature.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcomes were life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Secondary outcomes include radical treatment, metastasis, and prostate cancer death.  Results and limitations:   All AS strategies yielded more life years compared with WW. Lifetime risks of prostate cancer death and metastasis were, respectively, 5.42% and 6.40% with AS versus 8.72% and 10.30% with WW. AS yielded more QALYs than WW except in cohorts age >65 yr at diagnosis, or when treatment-related complications were long term. The preferred follow-up strategy was also sensitive to whether people value short-term over long-term benefits (time preference). Depending on the AS protocol, 30-41% underwent radical treatment within 10 yr. Extending the surveillance biopsy interval from 1 to 5 yr reduced life years slightly, with a 0.26 difference in QALYs.  Conclusions:   AS extends life more than WW, particularly for men with higher-risk features, but this is partly offset by the decrement in quality of life since many men eventually receive treatment.

A previous study of prostate cancer patients treated with RT generated clinical data for radiation-induced morbidity measured by anorectal physiological methods and validated questionnaires. Other studies have identified genetic predictors associated with late radiation-induced morbidity outcome. We have expanded biobank material aiming to validate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a gene expression classifier with endpoints on patient-reported outcomes and biomechanical properties of the anorectum from our cohort matching originally published endpoints.  Materials and methods:   The present cohort of prostate cancer patients was treated with RT curative intent in 1999-2007. Nine SNPs associated with late radiation-induced morbidity were tested in 96 patients (rs2788612, rs1800629, rs264663, rs2682585, rs2268363, rs1801516, rs13035033, rs7120482 and rs17779457). A validated gene expression profile predictive of resistance to radiation-induced skin fibrosis was tested in 42 patients. An RT-induced anorectal dysfunction score (RT-ARD) served as a fibrosis-surrogate and a measure of overall radiation-induced morbidity.  Results:   The lowest p-value found in the genotype analyses was for SNP rs2682585 minor allele (A) in the FSHR gene and the RT-ARD score with odds ratios (OR) = 1.76; 95% CI (0.98-3.17) p = .06, which was out of concordance with original data showing a protective effect of the minor allele. The gene expression profile in patients classified as fibrosis-resistant was associated with high RT-ARD scores OR 4.18; 95% CI (1.1-16.6), p = .04 conflicting with the hypothesis that fibrosis-resistant patients would experience lower RT-ARD scores.  Conclusions:   We aimed to validate nine SNPs and a gene expression classifier in a cohort of prostate cancer patients with unique scoring of radiation-induced morbidity. One significant association was found, pointing to the opposite direction of originally published data. We conclude that the material was not able to validate previously published genetic predictors of radiation-induced morbidity.""","""['Line M H Schack', 'Stine E Petersen', 'Steffen Nielsen', 'Lilly Lundby', 'Morten Høyer', 'Lise Bentzen', 'Jens Overgaard', 'Christian N Andreassen', 'Jan Alsner']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Development and validation of a scoring system for late anorectal side-effects in patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Pathophysiology of late anorectal dysfunction following external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Individual patient data meta-analysis shows a significant association between the ATM rs1801516 SNP and toxicity after radiotherapy in 5456 breast and prostate cancer patients.', 'Functional outcomes and complications following radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a critical analysis of the literature.', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism rs1801516 in Ataxia Telangiectasia-Mutated Gene Predicts Late Fibrosis in Cancer Patients After Radiotherapy: A PRISMA-Compliant Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Harnessing genome-wide association studies to minimize adverse radiation-induced side effects.', 'Frailty and aging in cancer survivors.']"""

Here, we analyzed PSMA expression in the neovasculature of various thyroid cancer subtypes and assessed whether PSMA expression is correlated with aggressive behavior. From a prospectively maintained database, we evaluated 91 samples from 68 patients, including 37 primary differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) [11 classic papillary (cPTC), 9 follicular-variant (FvPTC), 11 follicular (FTC), 6 radioactive iodine-refractory (RAIR)], 5 anaplastic (ATC) carcinomas, 9 distant and 12 lymph node metastases, 21 benign thyroid nodules, and 7 normal thyroid specimens. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were immunostained for vascular endothelial marker CD31 and PSMA with proper controls. PSMA expression was not detected in normal thyroid tissue. DTC tumors demonstrated a significantly higher PSMA expression, in regard to both intensity and percentage of vessels stained, than benign tumors (p < 0.001). Among the histologic subtypes, cPTC, FTC, and RAIR carcinomas demonstrated the highest percent of moderate to strong PSMA staining. PSMA expression was seen more frequently in specimens from distant metastases (100%) compared with specimens from only lymph node metastases (67%). PSMA is significantly overexpressed in the neovasculature of DTCs compared with normal and benign thyroid nodules specifically with increased expression in RAIR carcinomas and distant metastases.

In this study, CD44+/CD133+ human prostate cancer stem cells (HuPCaSCs) were isolated from the prostate cancer cell lines Du145 and 22RV1. Curcumin treatment of these cells resulted in the inhibition of in vitro proliferation and invasion, and cell cycle arrest. The expression levels of cell cycle proteins (Ccnd1 and Cdk4) and stem cell markers (Oct4, CD44, and CD133) were decreased in curcumin-treated HuPCaSCs. Microarray analysis and northern blotting assays indicated that miR-145 was overexpressed in curcumin-treated HuPCaSCs. Insights of the mechanism of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) were gained from bioinformatic analysis, bioinformatics analysis and luciferase activity assays showed that the lncRNA-ROR and Oct4 mRNA both contain miR-145 binding sites, and Oct4 and lncRNA-ROR directly compete for microRNA binding. Curcumin induced high miR-145 expression and inhibited the expression of lncRNA-ROR. The tumorigenicity of curcumin- treated HuPCaSCs in nude mice was significantly reduced. In summary, reducing the expression of endogenous lncRNA-ROR could effectively increase the available concentration of miR-145 in HuPCaSCs, where miR-145 prevents cell proliferation by decreasing Oct4 expression. In particular, we hypothesized that lncRNA-ROR may act as a ceRNA, effectively becoming a sink for miR-145, thereby activating the derepression of core transcription factors Oct4. Thus, curcumin suppresses the proliferation, in vitro invasion, and tumorigenicity of HuPCaSCs through ceRNA effect of miR-145 and lncRNA-ROR caused.""","""['Te Liu', 'Huiying Chi', 'Jiulin Chen', 'Chuan Chen', 'Yongyi Huang', 'Hao Xi', 'Jun Xue', 'Yibing Si']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Gene""","""['ROR functions as a ceRNA to regulate Nanog expression by sponging miR-145 and predicts poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.', 'Curcumin Suppresses In Vitro Proliferation and Invasion of Human Prostate Cancer Stem Cells by Modulating DLK1-DIO3 Imprinted Gene Cluster MicroRNAs.', 'Cucurbitacin B suppresses proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells by ceRNA: Effect of miR-146b-5p and lncRNA-AFAP1-AS1.', 'Curcumin as an Adjunct Therapy and microRNA Modulator in Breast Cancer.', 'Antitumor, anti-invasion, and antimetastatic effects of curcumin.', 'Pharmacological Mechanisms and Clinical Applications of Curcumin: Update.', 'Connection of Cancer Exosomal LncRNAs, Sponging miRNAs, and Exosomal Processing and Their Potential Modulation by Natural Products.', 'Emerging RNA-Based Therapeutic and Diagnostic Options: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Functional Relevance of the Long Intergenic Non-Coding RNA Regulator of Reprogramming (Linc-ROR) in Cancer Proliferation, Metastasis, and Drug Resistance.', 'Contribution of Non-Coding RNAs to Anticancer Effects of Dietary Polyphenols: Chlorogenic Acid, Curcumin, Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate, Genistein, Quercetin and Resveratrol.']"""

Patients and methods:   We analyzed the data of 1491 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for biopsy GS 3 + 3 or 3 + 4 PCa who fulfilled the low-risk criteria of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines regardless of GS. The favorable GS 3 + 4 group was defined as having core involvement ≤ 50%, prostate-specific antigen density ≤ 0.2 ng/mL/cm3, and number of positive cores ≤ 2 (maximal 1 core of GS 3 + 4).  Results:   The GS 3 + 4 group showed significantly worse pathologic outcomes, including pathologic GS, pathologic stage, and seminal vesicle invasion rate (all P < .001), as well as worse biochemical recurrence-free survival (P < .001) than the GS 3 + 3 group. However, the favorable GS 3 + 4 subgroup showed no significant differences in the pathologic outcomes (all P > .05) and in biochemical recurrence-free survival (P = .817) compared to the GS 3 + 3 group.  Conclusion:   Despite the application of low-risk criteria, GS 3 + 4 PCa patients showed significantly worse outcomes than GS 3 + 3 patients.

Methods and materials:   The 4 participating centers had MriPlanner (Spectronic Medical), an atlas-based sCT generation software, installed as a cloud-based service. A T2-weighted MR sequence, covering the body contour, was added to the clinical protocol. The MR images were sent from the MR scanner workstation to the MriPlanner platform. The sCT was automatically returned to the treatment planning system. Four MR scanners and 2 magnetic field strengths were included in the study. For each patient, a CT-treatment plan was created and approved according to clinical practice. The sCT was rigidly registered to the CT, and the clinical treatment plan was recalculated on the sCT. The dose distributions from the CT plan and the sCT plan were compared according to a set of dose-volume histogram parameters and gamma evaluation. Treatment techniques included volumetric modulated arc therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy, and conventional treatment using 2 treatment planning systems and different dose calculation algorithms.  Results:   The overall (multicenter/multivendor) mean dose differences between sCT and CT dose distributions were below 0.3% for all evaluated organs and targets. Gamma evaluation showed a mean pass rate of 99.12% (0.63%, 1 SD) in the complete body volume and 99.97% (0.13%, 1 SD) in the planning target volume using a 2%/2-mm global gamma criteria.  Conclusions:   Results of the study show that the sCT conversion method can be used clinically, with minimal differences between sCT and CT dose distributions for target and relevant organs at risk. The small differences seen are consistent between centers, indicating that an MR imaging-only workflow using MriPlanner is robust for a variety of field strengths, vendors, and treatment techniques.""","""['Emilia Persson', 'Christian Gustafsson', 'Fredrik Nordström', 'Maja Sohlin', 'Adalsteinn Gunnlaugsson', 'Karin Petruson', 'Niina Rintelä', 'Kristoffer Hed', 'Lennart Blomqvist', 'Björn Zackrisson', 'Tufve Nyholm', 'Lars E Olsson', 'Carl Siversson', 'Joakim Jonsson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Investigating the generalisation of an atlas-based synthetic-CT algorithm to another centre and MR scanner for prostate MR-only radiotherapy.', 'Technical Note: MRI only prostate radiotherapy planning using the statistical decomposition algorithm.', 'Applying a commercial atlas-based synthetic Computed Tomography algorithm to patients with hip prostheses for prostate Magnetic Resonance-only radiotherapy.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'Deep learning methods to generate synthetic CT from MRI in radiotherapy: A literature review.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'An evaluation of quality assurance guidelines comparing the American College of Radiology and American Association of Physicists in Medicine task group 284 for magnetic resonance simulation.', 'Possibilities and challenges when using synthetic computed tomography in an adaptive carbon-ion treatment workflow.', 'Comparison of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methods, Incorporating Male and Female Anatomical Differences, for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Definitive Pelvic Radiotherapy.', 'A narrative review of MRI acquisition for MR-guided-radiotherapy in prostate cancer.']"""

It is designed to lower the dose to nearby healthy tissues, the urethra in particular, relative to conventional high-dose-rate brachytherapy techniques.  Methods and materials:   Following needle implantation through the patient template, an angular drive mechanism is docked to the patient template. Each needle is coupled to a multisource afterloader catheter by a connector passing through a shaft. The shafts are rotated about their axes by translating a moving template between 2 stationary templates. The shafts' surfaces and moving template holes are helically threaded with the same pattern such that translation of the moving template causes simultaneous rotation of the shafts. The rotation of each shaft is mechanically transmitted to the catheter-source-shield combination, inside the needles, via several key-keyway pairs. The catheter angles are simultaneously incremented throughout treatment, and only a single 360° rotation of all catheters is needed for a full treatment. For each rotation angle, source depth in each needle is controlled by a multisource afterloader, which is proposed as an array of belt-driven linear actuators, each of which drives a wire that controls catheter depth in a needle.  Results:   Treatment plans demonstrated that RSBT with the proposed apparatus reduced urethral D0.1cm3 (the minimum dose delivered to the hottest 0.1cm3 of the urethra) below that of conventional high-dose-rate brachytherapy by 31% for urethral dose gradient volume within 3 mm of the urethra surface. Treatment time to deliver 20 Gy with the proposed multisource RSBT apparatus by use of nineteen 62.4-GBq 153Gd sources was 122 minutes.
