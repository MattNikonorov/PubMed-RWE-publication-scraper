To assess value for money, their cost effectiveness in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective was investigated.  Methods:   A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using efficacy, symptomatic skeletal-related event and safety data obtained from indirect treatment comparisons. Missing skeletal-related event data for cabazitaxel were conservatively assumed to be identical to radium-223. A Markov model combined these clinical inputs with Dutch-specific resource use and costs for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment from a societal perspective. Total quality-adjusted life-years and costs in 2017 euros were calculated over a 5-year (lifetime) time horizon.  Results:   Radium-223 resulted in €6092 and €4465 lower costs and 0.02 and 0.01 higher quality-adjusted life-years compared with abiraterone and cabazitaxel, respectively, demonstrating dominance of radium-223. Sensitivity analyses reveal a 64% (54%) chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with abiraterone (cabazitaxel) at the informal €80,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Compared with enzalutamide, radium-223 resulted in slightly lower quality-adjusted life-years (-0.06) and €7390 lower costs, revealing a 61% chance of radium-223 being cost effective compared with enzalutamide. The lower costs of radium-223 compared with abiraterone and enzalutamide are driven by lower drug costs and prevention of expensive skeletal-related events. Compared with cabazitaxel, the lower costs of radium-223 are driven by lower costs of the drug, administration and adverse events.  Conclusion:   Radium-223 may be a less costly treatment strategy offering similar gains in health benefits compared with abiraterone, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel from the Dutch societal perspective.""","""['Michel L Peters', 'Claudine de Meijer', 'Dirk Wyndaele', 'Walter Noordzij', 'Annemarie M Leliveld-Kors', 'Joan van den Bosch', 'Pieter H van den Berg', 'Agni Baka', 'Jennifer G Gaultney']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Appl Health Econ Health Policy""","""['Correction to: Dutch Economic Value of Radium-223 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'New therapeutic options in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Can cost-effectiveness analysis help in treatment decisions?', 'Cost-effectiveness model of abiraterone plus prednisone, cabazitaxel plus prednisone and enzalutamide for visceral metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer therapy after docetaxel therapy resistance.', 'Treatment of Metastatic, Castration-resistant, Docetaxel-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of Literature With a Network Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.', 'Cabazitaxel for Hormone-Relapsed Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With a Docetaxel-Containing Regimen: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Alpha emitter radium-223 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A cost-utility analysis.', 'Health utility and health-related quality of life of Japanese prostate cancer patients according to progression status measured using EQ-5D-5L and FACT-P.', 'Cost-effectiveness analyses and cost analyses in castration-resistant prostate cancer: A systematic review.']"""

We therefore examined whether an approach, utilizing personalized multiple peptide-mediated ex vivo enrichment with effector T cells reactive to multiple tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), could be employed as a basis for the development of T cell immunotherapy of PCa. In this study, we used the non-adherent fraction (lymphocytes) of cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a leukapheretic product of biochemically recurrent (BR, n = 14) and metastatic hormone-refractory (HR, n = 12) PCa patients. The lymphocytes were primed with a pool of mixed overlapping peptides derived from 6 PCa TAAs-PSA, PAP, NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3 and MAGE-A4. After 2 weeks of culture, the cells were stimulated with the peptides and T cell reactivity determined by externalization of CD107a. No TAAs-reactive effector T cells were detected in the patient's lymphocytes after their reconstitution. However, following their priming with the TAAs-derived peptides and 2-week culturing, the lymphocytes became enriched with polyclonal TAAs-reactive effector CD8+ T cells in 8 out of 14 BR and 5 out of 12 HR patients. No such reactive CD8+ T cells were detected in cultured lymphocytes without the peptide priming. Stimulation of the responding cultures with peptides derived from individual TAAs revealed a unique repertoire of the reactive CD8+ T cells. Our strategy revealed that the personalized multiple peptide-mediated ex vivo enrichment with multiple TAAs-reactive T cells in the PCa patient's lymphocytes is a viable approach for development of T cell immunotherapy of PCa.""","""['Pavla Taborska', 'Dmitry Stakheev', 'Zuzana Strizova', 'Katerina Vavrova', 'Michal Podrazil', 'Jirina Bartunkova', 'Daniel Smrz']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Med Oncol""","""['Expansion of cancer germline antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes for immunotherapy.', 'MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, and NY-ESO-1 can be upregulated on neuroblastoma cells to facilitate cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated tumor cell killing.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen: Identification of immunogenic peptides and assessment of reactive CD8+ T cells in prostate cancer patients.', 'The present status and future prospects of peptide-based cancer vaccines.', 'Advances in specific immunotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein-reactive T cells can be readily expanded from COVID-19 vaccinated donors.', 'CD4+ T Cells of Prostate Cancer Patients Have Decreased Immune Responses to Antigens Derived From SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein.', 'Functional and mechanistic studies reveal MAGEA3 as a pro-survival factor in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'The WNT/β-catenin signaling inhibitor XAV939 enhances the elimination of LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cells by prostate cancer patient lymphocytes in vitro.']"""

The variables analyzed include, demographics, comorbidities associated with MetS or CVD, behavioral and dietary factors, while the primary endpoints were the prevalence of MetS and CVD. The prevalence of MetS and CVD was slightly higher in males as compared with females (42.50% and 7.65% vs 41.29% and 4.13%, respectively). After controlling for confounding factors, advanced age, family history of diabetes mellitus (DM), overweight, and obesity were significantly associated with the likelihood of MetS, irrespective of gender differences. In males, the diagnosis of prostate cancer and regular smoking were additional risk factors of MetS, whereas, advanced age, family history of heart attack or angina, health insurance coverage, diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or depression, obesity and low calorie intake were identified as risk factors for CVD. In addition to the above risk factors, higher physical activity and vitamin D insufficiency were also found to increase the risk of CVD in females. Furthermore, obesity was a higher risk factor for MetS than CVD. Emerging risk factors for CVD identified in this study has major clinical implications. Of interest is the correlation of higher physical activity and the risk of CVD in women and the role of depression and lower calorie intake in general population.""","""['Xiu-E Zhang', 'Bei Cheng', 'Qian Wang', 'Jing-Jing Wan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Investig Med""","""['Cardiovascular Health Status and Metabolic Syndrome in Adults Living in a Transition European Country: Findings from a Population-Based Study.', 'Standardized serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are inversely associated with cardiometabolic disease in U.S. adults: a cross-sectional analysis of NHANES, 2001-2010.', 'Metabolic syndrome and parental history of cardiovascular disease in young adults in urban Ghana.', 'Metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases in Korea.', 'Metabolic Syndrome: Sex-Related Cardiovascular Risk and Therapeutic Approach.', 'A Narrative Review of the Association Between Depression and Heart Disease Among Women: Prevalence, Mechanisms of Action, and Treatment.', 'Association between metabolic syndrome and 13 types of cancer in Catalonia: A matched case-control study.', 'Effects of Tai Chi Softball Exercises on Physical Fitness Level and Cardiovascular Health-Related Factors among Older Females.', 'Sex hormones affect endothelial lipase-mediated lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis.', 'Health-Associated Nutrition and Exercise Behaviors in Relation to Metabolic Risk Factors Stratified by Body Mass Index.']"""

The traditional workflow is to exactly model the problem and then enter this model into a general-purpose ""black-box"" solver. In practice, however, many problems cannot be solved completely automatically, but require a ""human-in-the-loop"" to iteratively refine the model and give hints to the solver. In this paper, we explore the parallels between this interactive optimisation workflow and the visual analytics sense-making loop. We assert that interactive optimisation is essentially a visual analytics task and propose a problem-solving loop analogous to the sense-making loop. We explore these ideas through an in-depth analysis of a use-case in prostate brachytherapy, an application where interactive optimisation may be able to provide significant assistance to practitioners in creating prostate cancer treatment plans customised to each patient's tumour characteristics. However, current brachytherapy treatment planning is usually a careful, mostly manual process involving multiple professionals. We developed a prototype interactive optimisation tool for brachytherapy that goes beyond current practice in supporting focal therapy - targeting tumour cells directly rather than simply seeking coverage of the whole prostate gland. We conducted semi-structured interviews, in two stages, with seven radiation oncology professionals in order to establish whether they would prefer to use interactive optimisation for treatment planning and whether such a tool could improve their trust in the novel focal therapy approach and in machine generated solutions to the problem.""","""['Jie Liu', 'Tim Dwyer', 'Kim Marriott', 'Jeremy Millar', 'Annette Haworth']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Vis Comput Graph""","""['Evaluation of a Machine-Learning Algorithm for Treatment Planning in Prostate Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy.', 'A multi-atlas-based segmentation framework for prostate brachytherapy.', 'A radiobiology-based inverse treatment planning method for optimisation of permanent l-125 prostate implants in focal brachytherapy.', 'Role of Prostate MR Imaging in Radiation Oncology.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

This ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation regulates STIM1 localization and dissociation from microtubules, and it is known that enhances the binding to ORAI1, a store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) channel, leading to the activation of this Ca2+ influx pathway. However, there remained some evidence of a role for SOCE in the activation of ERK1/2, and here we assessed the contribution of SOCE to ERK1/2 activation by generating a STIM1-deficient cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of the STIM1 locus in prostate cancer PC3 cells. The genomic modification consisted of a 16 base-pair insertion in exon 5 of both alleles, therefore abrogating STIM1 synthesis. STIM1-KO cells did show a striking decrease in Ca2+ influx in response to thapsigargin or EGF, a result that demonstrates that SOCE mediates Ca2+ entry in PC3 cells during stimulation with EGF. Moreover, identical levels of total ERK1/2 were found in STIM1-KO cells and the parental cell line, and ERK1/2 activation was fully activated in KO cells, both in the presence and in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, a result that supports that STIM1 and SOCE are not required for ERK1/2 activation. This activation was sensitive to Src kinase inhibition, but not to CAMKII nor PKC inhibition, a result that sets STIM1 and SOCE as downstream targets of the axis Src-Raf-MEK-ERK, rather than upstream regulators.""","""['Aida M Lopez-Guerrero', 'Carlos Pascual-Caro', 'Francisco Javier Martin-Romero', 'Eulalia Pozo-Guisado']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Ca2+/Calmodulin Binding to STIM1 Hydrophobic Residues Facilitates Slow Ca2+-Dependent Inactivation of the Orai1 Channel.', 'Thapsigargin activates Ca²+ entry both by store-dependent, STIM1/Orai1-mediated, and store-independent, TRPC3/PLC/PKC-mediated pathways in human endothelial cells.', 'Phosphorylation of STIM1 at ERK1/2 target sites regulates interaction with the microtubule plus-end binding protein EB1.', 'Store-Independent Orai Channels Regulated by STIM.', 'Fine-tuning of store-operated calcium entry by fast and slow Ca2+-dependent inactivation: Involvement of SARAF.', 'ATP purinergic receptor signalling promotes Sca-1+ cell proliferation and migration for vascular remodelling.', 'FGF19/SOCE/NFATc2 signaling circuit facilitates the self-renewal of liver cancer stem cells.', 'STIM1 Deficiency Leads to Specific Down-Regulation of ITPR3 in SH-SY5Y Cells.', 'Mechanical tumor microenvironment and transduction: cytoskeleton mediates cancer cell invasion and metastasis.', 'RAC1-Dependent ORAI1 Translocation to the Leading Edge Supports Lamellipodia Formation and Directional Persistence.']"""

Tissue- or cell-based in situ detection of AR-V7, however, has been limited by lack of specificity.  Objective:   To address current limitations in precision measurement of AR-V7 by developing a novel junction-specific AR-V7 RNA in situ hybridization (RISH) assay compatible with automated quantification.  Design, setting, and participants:   We designed a RISH method to visualize single splice junctions in cells and tissue. Using the validated assay for junction-specific detection of the full-length AR (AR-FL) and AR-V7, we generated quantitative data, blinded to clinical data, for 63 prostate tumor biopsies.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We evaluated clinical correlates of AR-FL/AR-V7 measurements, including association with prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) and clinical and radiographic progression-free survival (PFS), in a subset of patients starting treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide following biopsy.  Results and limitations:   Quantitative AR-FL/AR-V7 data were generated from 56 of the 63 (88.9%) biopsy specimens examined, of which 44 were mCRPC biopsies. Positive AR-V7 signals were detected in 34.1% (15/44) mCRPC specimens, all of which also co-expressed AR-FL. The median AR-V7/AR-FL ratio was 11.9% (range 2.7-30.3%). Positive detection of AR-V7 was correlated with indicators of high disease burden at baseline. Among the 25 CRPC biopsies collected before treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, positive AR-V7 detection, but not higher AR-FL, was significantly associated with shorter PSA-PFS (hazard ratio 2.789, 95% confidence interval 1.12-6.95; p=0.0081).  Conclusions:   We report for the first time a RISH method for highly specific and quantifiable detection of splice junctions, allowing further characterization of AR-V7 and its clinical significance.

Materials and methods:   A total of 289 men with prior negative TRUSbx underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. The location of any suspicious lesion was registered and scored using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 1 classification according to the likelihood of being sPCa. All patients underwent repeat transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (reTRUSbx) and targeted mpMRIbx (image fusion) of any suspicious lesion. Biopsy results were compared and the locations of missed sPCa lesions were registered. Cancer significance was defined as (1) any core with a Gleason score of >6, (2) cancer core involvement of ≥50% and for reTRUSbx on patient level, and (3) the presence of ≥3 positive cores.  Results:   Of the 289 patients, prostate cancer was detected in 128 (44%) with 88 (30%) having sPCa. Overall, 165 separate prostate cancer lesions were detected with 100 being sPCa. Of these, mpMRIbx and reTRUSbx detected 90% (90/100) and 68% (68/100), respectively. The majority of sPCa lesions (78%) missed by primary TRUSbx were located either anteriorly or in the apical region. Missed sPCa lesions at repeat biopsy were primarily located anteriorly (84%) for reTRUSbx (n = 27/32) and posterolateral midprostatic (60%) for mpMRIbx (n = 6/10).  Conclusion:   Both TRUSbx and mpMRIbx missed sPCa lesions in specific segments of the prostate.

While observing no secreted IL-6 level in parental C4-2 and CWR22Rv1 cells, we found the IL-6 expression/secretion in these cells was induced after the transduction process and the IL-6 level difference in C4-2siIL-6/sc and CWR22siIL-6/sc cell CRPC cell sets could be detected. We then found that IL-6-knockdown cells were more susceptible to NK cell cytotoxicity than control cells due to lowered programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) and increased NK group 2D (NKG2D) ligand levels. In animal studies, to concur with the in vitro results, we found that IL-6-expressing cell-derived tumors were more resistant to NK cell action than the tumors of IL-6-knockdown cells. Further, we discovered that JAK-Stat3 is the most critical IL-6 downstream signaling that modulates PD-L1/NKG2D ligand levels in CRPC cells. Furthermore, inhibition of the JAK or Stat3 signaling effectively increased the susceptibility of C4-2sc and CWRsc cells to NK cell cytotoxicity. We observed the most effective cytotoxicity when the PD-L1 Ab and JAK inhibitor (or Stat 3 inhibitor) were used together.

Recent data indicate profound induction of drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g. cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 3A4) but comprehensive in vitro data on other CYP enzymes, drug conjugating enzymes or drug transporters is scarce. Moreover, the mechanisms of induction are poorly investigated and the effects of the active metabolite N-desmethyl enzalutamide are unknown. Using LS180 cells as an induction model and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, our study demonstrated a concentration-dependent induction of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP3A5, CYP3A4, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, ABCB1, ABCC2 and ABCG2 mRNA. Induction of CYP3A4 and ABCB1 was confirmed by Western blot analysis and is likely mediated by activation of the nuclear receptor pregnane x receptor, elucidated by a luciferase-based reporter gene assay. Enzalutamide's main active metabolite N-desmethyl enzalutamide exhibited only weak induction properties. mRNA expression of UGT2B7 was suppressed by enzalutamide and its metabolite. Both compounds are apparently not transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). N-desmethyl enzalutamide more potently inhibited important drug transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATPs) than enzalutamide. Taken together, the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered drugs is likely altered during enzalutamide therapy.

In context of a hypothetical beneficial beta-blocker use among cancer patients, we aimed to demonstrate the magnitude of ITB among 9876 prostate, colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancer patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2011, which were selected from a database linkage of the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the PHARMO Database Network. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals from three ITB scenarios, defining exposure at a defined point after diagnosis (model 1), at any point after diagnosis (model 2) and as multiple exposures after diagnosis (model 3), were calculated to investigate the association between beta-blockers and cancer prognosis using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results were compared to unbiased estimates derived from the Mantel-Byar model. Ignoring ITB led to substantial smaller HRs for beta-blocker use proposing a significant protective association in all cancer types [e.g. HR 0.18 (0.07-0.43) for pancreatic cancer in model 1], whereas estimates derived from the Mantel-Byar model were mainly suggesting no association [e.g. HR 1.10 (0.84-1.44)]. The magnitude of bias was consistently larger among cancer types with worse prognosis [overall median HR differences between all scenarios in model 1 and Mantel-Byar model of 0.56 (prostate), 0.72 (colorectal), 0.77 (lung) and 0.85 (pancreas)].

Methods:   Patients were characterized by baseline factors, stratified by risk groups using tumor stage (clinical T-stage), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result and Gleason grade, and sorted by treatment combinations (by radiation volume and use of androgen deprivation).  Results:   Overall, 205/216 men were Afro-Caribbean. Median age was 66.

Bone scintigraphy studies were reviewed and graded according to the extent of disease. Furthermore, an automated BSI (EXINI BoneBSI) was obtained for baseline scintigraphy studies and follow-up scans after 3 cycles as well as at the end of therapy. Clinical outcomes were OS and occurrence of hematologic toxicity of grades 2-5. Associations between the BSI and clinical outcomes were investigated in multivariate regression models including the visual assessment of bone scintigraphy and other relevant covariates. Results: A total of 88 patients were included. The median number of completed 223RaCl2 cycles was 4, and 27 patients (31%) completed 6 cycles. The BSI was significantly associated with OS in the multivariate analysis; the median OS for patients with a BSI of greater than 5 was 8.2 mo, and the median OS for patients with a BSI of less than or equal to 5 was 15.0 mo (hazard ratio, 2.65 [95% confidence interval, 1.5-4.71]; P = 0.001).

The BSI declined during therapy in 44% of the patients who completed 3 cycles of 223RaCl2 (n = 52) and in 84% of the patients after the end of therapy (n = 32). There was no significant association between a change in the BSI during therapy and OS.

The role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in epithelial ovarian carcinoma is an emerging area of research.  Materials and methods:   LncRNA PCA3 expression was determined in EOC and normal ovarian tissues by RT-PCR. Phenotypes indicative of tumor progression and aggressiveness, including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and expression of related molecules, were analysed in EOC cell following knockdown of lncRNA PCA3 by transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA).  Results:   Expression of lncRNA PCA3 in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues was higher than in normal ovarian tissue. We discovered that knockdown of lncRNA PCA3 in EOC cells by siRNA transfection significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Bioinformatic predictions and dual-luciferase reporter assays indicate that the 3'UTR of PCA3 has potential binding sites for miR-106b-5p. Knockdown of the lncRNA PCA3 by siRNA resulted in up-regulated miR-106b expression. In addition, knockdown of PCA3 also reduced protein expression of Ras homolog gene family member C (RhoC), Bcl/xl, P70 ribosomal S6 kinase (P70S6K), and Matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2), which are regulated by miR-106b.  Conclusions:   Research results show that lncRNA PCA3 may coordinate EOC tumorigenesis through disrupting miR-106b regulated gene expression.

Methods:   We followed 440,277 men and women from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study (ages 50-71) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (ages 55-74) for mortality for 13 years on average. Frequency of aspirin use was ascertained through self-report, and cause of death by death certificates. We calculated multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality using Cox proportional hazards models for each cohort and combined by meta-analysis.  Results:   We found a consistent U-shaped relationship between aspirin use and mortality in both studies, with differential risk patterns for cardiovascular mortality by disease history. Among individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, daily aspirin use was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality [HR = 0.78 (95% CI, 0.74, 0.82)]. However, among those without a previous history, we observed no protection for daily aspirin users [HR = 1.06 (1.02, 1.11)], and elevated risk of cardiovascular mortality for those taking aspirin twice daily or more [HR = 1.29 (1.19, 1.39)]. Elevated risk persisted even among participants who lived beyond 5 years of follow-up and used aspirin without other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [HR = 1.31 (1.17, 1.47)].

The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of FNAB in the diagnosis of bone lesions.  Methods:   FNABs of bone lesions diagnosed at our institution over a 2-year period were retrospectively analyzed.  Results:   241 samples were reviewed. Patients included 121 males and 120 females, with ages ranging from 4-95 years (mean = 66 years). Of these 241 cases, 43.2% had FNAB and 56.8% had FNAB with core needle biopsy (CNB). The cytologic diagnoses were categorized as nondiagnostic, benign, atypical, suspicious, and positive for malignant cells. Total of 84.3% of FNABs were diagnostic. Of the malignant cases, 78.5% were metastases from nonosseous primary sites, 17.1% were lymphoproliferative lesions, and 4.4% were primary bone tumors. The most common site of metastasis was the pelvic bones (43.5%) followed by the vertebral column (38.7%). Breast (21%), lung (12.7%), and prostate (11.3%) were the most common identifiable primary site in metastatic cases. FNA smears and cell blocks allowed identification of metastatic lesions in 94.3% cases with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Obtaining a concomitant CNB did not result in a statistically significant increase in overall diagnostic yields (P = .20), ascertaining presence of metastatic lesion (P = .96) or ability to identify site of primary tumor in cases of metastasis (P = .53) compared to FNAB alone.

Methods:   Geometric distortion correction was performed in echo-planar diffusion-weighted images (b = 0, 50, 400, 800 s/mm2 ) of 28 patients, using two b0 scans with opposing phase-encoding polarities. Histology-matched tumor and healthy tissue volumes of interest delineated on T2 -weighted images were mapped to the nondistortion-corrected and distortion-corrected data sets by resampling with and without spatial coregistration. The ADC values were calculated on the volume and voxel level.

Therefore, the aim of our study was to compare the users of traditional face-to-face support groups and OSG.  Patients and methods:   We performed a cross-sectional comparison study of all regional face-to-face support groups and the largest OSG in Germany. By applying validated instruments, the survey covered sociodemographic and disease-related information, decision-making habits, psychological aspects, and quality of life.  Results:   We analyzed the complete data of 955 patients visiting face-to-face support groups and 686 patients using OSG. Patients using OSG were 6 years younger (65.3 vs. 71.5 years; p < 0.001), had higher education levels (47 vs. 21%; p < 0.001), and had higher income. Patients using OSG reported a higher share of metastatic disease (17 vs. 12%; p < 0.001). Patients using OSG reported greater distress. There were no significant differences in anxiety, depression, and global quality of life. In the face-to-face support groups, patient ratings were better for exchanging information, gaining recognition, and caring for others. Patients using OSG demanded a more active role in the treatment decision-making process (58 vs. 33%; p < 0.001) and changed their initial treatment decision more frequently (29 vs. 25%; p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Both modalities of peer support received very positive ratings by their users and have significant impact on treatment decision-making.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Older patients might benefit more from the continuous social support in face-to-face support groups.

Methods:   Men after prostatectomy (RP) and RT were assigned in adjuvant (ART), early salvage (ESRT) and salvage radiotherapy (SRT) groups depending on time of initiation, indication and pre-RT-PSA (≤/>0.5 ng/ml). Continence and QoL outcomes were evaluated by validated questionnaire. Statistical analysis included students t test, Chi square, Fisher's test, ROC- and McNemar-Bowker-Analyses.  Results:   The mean follow-up was 5.1 years. 33.5, 38.2 and 28.3% received ART, ESRT and SRT, respectively. Mean time to RT was 0.3 (±0.4), 1.8 (±2.5) and 3.3 (±3.6) years respectively. Differences in age at RP (p = 0.54) and RT (p = 0.47) between groups were not significant. Mean-RT-dose was similar (p = 0.70). Differences in continence distribution between groups before (p = 0.56) and after RT (p = 0.38) were not significant. No significant differences were observed for frequency (p = 0.58) or amount (p = 0.88) of urine loss, impact on QoL (p = 0.13) and ICIQ-SF scores (p = 0.69) between groups. Even though no significant difference in post-RT-continence (p = 0.89) was observed in the direct comparison between groups, a significant worsening of long-term continence was observed in all groups (p < 0.001). We found no cutoff and no time-point after RP at which this negative effect of RT on continence became insignificant (AUC = 0.474). A subgroup with apparent local recurrence showed no differences for ICIQ-SF-score (p = 0.155), QoL (0.077), incontinence grade (p = 0.387), frequency (p = 0.182) and amount (p = 0.415) of urine loss. Proportionally more men in this subgroup remembered deterioration of continence after RT (p = 0.029).

Because multigene tests offer higher diagnostic accuracy and lower overall cost than single assays, they are especially useful for diseases, like prostate cancer, that present variability at the molecular level and diversity of available therapeutic interventions. We have developed a quantitative competitive PCR for an eight-gene panel, related to prostate cancer, that includes five genes of the human tissue kallikrein family (KLKs), prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), and HPRT1 as a reference gene. Using PCR as a synthetic tool, a competitor was prepared for each target sequence containing the same primer binding sites as the target but differing in a short segment to enable discrimination by hybridization. The assay involves multiplex amplification of targets and competitors followed by a multiplex hybridization assay for the 16 amplification products. The assay was performed on optically encoded microspheres with oligonucleotide probes attached to their surface. The microspheres were analyzed rapidly (1 min) by flow cytometry. The signal ratio of the target and cognate competitor is a function of the target copy number in the sample prior to amplification.

Broad-spectrum XMRV DNA amplification was performed by end-point polymerase chain reaction, using commercially available primer set.  Results:   The study included 100 patients with prostate cancer. XMRV DNA was detected in 4 of 8 (50%) ductal adenocarcinomas, exhibiting papillary and cribriform histological features. XMRV DNA was not detected in any other variant of adenocarcinoma including acinar (0/91) and mucinous carcinomas (0/1).

The activation of STAT3 signaling is positively associated with poor prognosis and aggressive progression in OS patients. Our previous study reported that the FDA-approved antipsychotic drug pimozide had anti-tumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer cells by suppressing STAT3 activity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the specific effect of pimozide on OS cells and the underlying molecular mechanism. Pimozide inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and sphere formation capacities of the OS cells in a dose-dependent manner, inducing G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Pimozide reduced the percentage of side population cells representing cancer stem-like cells and enhanced the sensitivity of OS cells to 5-FU induced proliferative inhibition. In addition, pimozide induced apoptosis of U2OS cells, which showed increased expression of cleaved-PARP, a marker of programmed cell death. Moreover, pimozide suppressed Erk signaling in OS cells. Importantly, pimozide induced ROS generation by downregulating the expression of the antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT). NAC treatment partially reversed the ROS generation and cytotoxic effects induced by pimozide. CAT treatment attenuated the pimozide-induced proliferation inhibition. The decrease of CAT expression induced by pimozide was potentially mediated through the suppression of cellular STAT3 activity in OS cells. Thus, pimozide may be a novel STAT3 inhibitor that suppresses cellular STAT3 activity to inhibit OS cells or stem-like cells and is a novel potential anti-cancer agent in OS treatment.""","""['Nan Cai', 'Wei Zhou', 'Lan-Lan Ye', 'Jun Chen', 'Qiu-Ni Liang', 'Gang Chang', 'Jia-Jie Chen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Am J Transl Res""","""['The antipsychotic drug pimozide inhibits cell growth in prostate cancer through suppression of STAT3 activation.', 'Suppressing STAT5 signaling affects osteosarcoma growth and stemness.', 'The neuroleptic drug pimozide inhibits stem-like cell maintenance and tumorigenicity in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Alternol, a natural compound, exerts an anti-tumour effect on osteosarcoma by modulating of STAT3 and ROS/MAPK signalling pathways.', 'Inhibition of cancer stem cells promoted by Pimozide.', 'Cold plasma and inhibition of STAT3 selectively target tumorigenicity in osteosarcoma.', 'Repurposing Antipsychotics for Cancer Treatment.', 'Dexmedetomidine protects cardiomyocytes against hypoxia/reoxygenation injury via multiple mechanisms.', 'Repurposing diphenylbutylpiperidine-class antipsychotic drugs for host-directed therapy of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella enterica infections.', 'Targeting Reactive Oxygen Species Capacity of Tumor Cells with Repurposed Drug as an Anticancer Therapy.']"""

The evaluation of clinical data (computed tomography scan, endosonography, surgical reports, pathological evaluation) of patients gave insight into the topographical relationship between the tumor and its surroundings. Both were used to establish the biophysical model of the tumors and their surroundings, closely mirroring the clinical situation, in which we could virtually design, place and evaluate different electromagnetic coil configurations to find optimized magnetic field traps for each tumor entity. By simulation, we could show that the efficiency of the magnetic field traps can be enhanced by 38-fold for prostate and 8-fold for esophageal cancer. Therefore, our approach of endoscopic targeting is an improvement of the magnetic drug-targeting setups for SPION tumor therapy as it holds the possibility of reaching tumors inside the body in a minimal-invasive way. Future animal experiments must prove these findings in vivo.""","""['Anjali A Roeth#', 'Ioana Slabu#', 'Martin Baumann', 'Patrick H Alizai', 'Maximilian Schmeding', 'Gernot Guentherodt', 'Thomas Schmitz-Rode', 'Ulf P Neumann']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Superparamagnetic reconstituted high-density lipoprotein nanocarriers for magnetically guided drug delivery.', 'Epirubicin-loaded superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles for transdermal delivery: cancer therapy by circumventing the skin barrier.', 'Magnetic targeting after femoral artery administration and biocompatibility assessment of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.', 'Magnetic nanoparticle-induced hyperthermia with appropriate payloads: Paul Ehrlich\'s ""magic (nano)bullet"" for cancer theranostics?', 'Magnetic nanoparticle-based drug delivery for cancer therapy.', 'Iron Oxide Nanoparticle-Based Hyperthermia as a Treatment Option in Various Gastrointestinal Malignancies.', '3D-Printed Replica and Porcine Explants for Pre-Clinical Optimization of Endoscopic Tumor Treatment by Magnetic Targeting.', 'Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia as Treatment Option for Pancreatic Cancer Cells and Pancreatic Cancer Organoids.', 'Cellular SPION Uptake and Toxicity in Various Head and Neck Cancer Cell Lines.', 'The Use of Alternative Strategies for Enhanced Nanoparticle Delivery to Solid Tumors.']"""

Automation is an ideal approach for high-throughput sample preparation. Multi-plexing sample preparation via a 96-well plate format becomes popular in recent years; however, those methods lack specificity and require several cleanup steps via chromatography purification. To overcome these drawbacks, a chemoenzymatic method has been developed utilizing protein conjugation on solid-phase. Previously, sample preparation was successfully performed in a snap-cap spin-column (SCSC) format. However, sample preparation using SCSC is time-consuming and lacks reproducibility. In this work, we integrated the chemoenzymatic technique in a pipette tip (AutoTip) that was operated by an automated liquid handler. We established a multi-step protocol involving protein immobilization, sialic acid modification, and N-glycan release. We first optimized our automated protocol using bovine fetuin as a standard glycoprotein, and then assessed the reproducibility of the AutoTip using isobaric tags for relative N-linked glycan quantification. We then applied this methodology to profile N-glycans from 58 prostate cancer patient urine samples, revealing increased sialyation on urinary N-glycans derived from prostate cancer patients. Our results indicated AutoTip has applications for high-throughput sample preparation for studying the N-linked glycans.""","""['Shuang Yang', 'David Clark', 'Yang Liu', 'Shuwei Li', 'Hui Zhang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Automation of High-Throughput Mass Spectrometry-Based Plasma N-Glycome Analysis with Linkage-Specific Sialic Acid Esterification.', 'Rapid magnetic bead based sample preparation for automated and high throughput N-glycan analysis of therapeutic antibodies.', 'High-Throughput Analysis of the Plasma N-Glycome by UHPLC.', 'State-of-the-art technologies for rapid and high-throughput sample preparation and analysis of N-glycans from antibodies.', 'Preparation of Complex Glycans From Natural Sources for Functional Study.', 'Direct Detection of Glycated Human Serum Albumin and Hyperglycosylated IgG3 in Serum, by MALDI-ToF Mass Spectrometry, as a Predictor of COVID-19 Severity.', 'Sample Preparation and Diagnostic Methods for a Variety of Settings: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Glycosylation: Rising Potential for Prostate Cancer Evaluation.', 'High-Throughput Analyses of Glycans, Glycosites, and Intact Glycopeptides Using C4-and C18/MAX-Tips and Liquid Handling System.', 'A Pragmatic Guide to Enrichment Strategies for Mass Spectrometry-Based Glycoproteomics.']"""

Secondly, to quantify the potential PTV reduction with decreased inter-observer variability.  Materials and methods:   A 320 slice volumetric CT scanner was used. The wide-detector coverage of 16cm enabled volumetric image acquisition of prostate gland in one rotation. Three imaging studies were performed on ten patients. CCT and HDVCT were performed consecutively at the same coordinate system followed by MRI. Five radiation oncologists delineated the prostate.  Results:   The inter-observer variability is 2.0±0.6, 1.9±0.4 and 1.8±0.4mm for CCT, HDVCT and MR respectively with the maximum at the apex region. Comparing inter-observer difference variability between CCT and HDVCT with MR indicates that observers have larger variations in contouring using CCT than HDVCT especially at apex. Jaccard index of HDVCT is significantly higher than CCT with a mean difference of 0.03 (p=0.011). Both MRI and HDVCT provide the opportunity for a 2mm PTV margin reduction at the apex compared to CCT.  Conclusion:   Inter-observer variability in delineation remains an important source of systematic error. HDCTV for treatment planning reduces this error without recourse to MRI and permits a PTV reduction of 2mm at the apex. The margins required to account for residual error with any imaging modality are still greater than are used in typical current practice.""","""['Hamideh Alasti', 'Young-Bin Cho', 'Charles Catton', 'Alejandro Berlin', 'Peter Chung', 'Andrew Bayley', 'Aaron Vandermeer', 'Vickie Kong', 'David Jaffray']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Impact of high dose volumetric CT on PTV margin reduction in VMAT prostate radiotherapy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging for prostate bed radiotherapy planning: An inter- and intra-observer variability study.', 'Inter- and intra-observer variability in contouring of the prostate gland on planning computed tomography and cone beam computed tomography.', 'Target definition in prostate, head, and neck.', 'The EPTN consensus-based atlas for CT- and MR-based contouring in neuro-oncology.', 'Combined proton radiography and irradiation for high-precision preclinical studies in small animals.', 'Biologically Targeted Radiation Therapy: Incorporating Patient-Specific Hypoxia Data Derived from Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Half-Brain Delineation for Prediction of Radiation-Induced Temporal Lobe Injury in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Receiving Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy.', 'An Inter-observer Study to Determine Radiotherapy Planning Target Volumes for Recurrent Gynaecological Cancer Comparing Magnetic Resonance Imaging Only With Computed Tomography-Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'New target volume delineation and PTV strategies to further personalise radiotherapy.']"""

However, ED utilization patterns by the population of US adults with cancer have not been previously evaluated or described in published literature.  Objective:   To estimate the proportion of US ED visits made by adults with a cancer diagnosis, understand the clinical presentation of adult patients with cancer in the ED, and examine factors related to inpatient admission within this population.  Design, setting, and participants:   Nationally representative data comprised of 7 survey cycles (January 2006-December 2012) from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample were analyzed. Identification of adult (age ≥18 years) cancer-related visits was based on Clinical Classifications Software diagnoses documented during the ED visit. Weighted frequencies and proportions of ED visits among adult patients with cancer by demographic, geographic, and clinical characteristics were calculated. Weighted multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the associations between inpatient admission and key demographic and clinical variables for adult cancer-related ED visits.  Main outcomes and measures:   Adult cancer-related ED utilization patterns; identification of primary reason for ED visit; patient-related factors associated with inpatient admission from the ED.  Results:   Among an estimated 696 million weighted adult ED visits from January 2006 to December 2012, 29.5 million (4.2%) were made by a patient with a cancer diagnosis. The most common cancers associated with an ED visit were breast, prostate, and lung cancer, and most common primary reasons for visit were pneumonia (4.5%), nonspecific chest pain (3.7%), and urinary tract infection (3.2%). Adult cancer-related ED visits resulted in inpatient admissions more frequently (59.7%) than non-cancer-related visits (16.3%) (P < .001). Septicemia (odds ratio [OR], 91.2; 95% CI, 81.2-102.3) and intestinal obstruction (OR, 10.94; 95% CI, 10.6-11.4) were associated with the highest odds of inpatient admission.  Conclusions and relevance:   Consistent with national prevalence statistics among adults, breast, prostate, and lung cancer were the most common cancer diagnoses presenting to the ED. Pneumonia was the most common reason for adult cancer-related ED visits with an associated high inpatient admission rate. This analysis highlights cancer-specific ED clinical presentations and the opportunity to inform patient and system-directed prevention and management strategies.""","""['Donna R Rivera', 'Lisa Gallicchio', 'Jeremy Brown', 'Benmei Liu', 'Demetrios N Kyriacou', 'Nonniekaye Shelburne']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Questions About Emergency Department Treatment of Patients With Solid Tumors and Hematological Malignant Neoplasms-Reply.', 'Questions About Emergency Department Treatment of Patients With Solid Tumors and Hematological Malignant Neoplasms.', 'Treatment-Related Complications of Systemic Therapy and Radiotherapy.', 'Incidence, admission rates, and economic burden of pediatric emergency department visits for urinary tract infection: data from the nationwide emergency department sample, 2006 to 2011.', 'Trends and Characteristics of Potentially Preventable Emergency Department Visits Among Patients With Cancer in the US.', 'Emergency department factors associated with survival after sudden cardiac arrest.', 'Cancer-related Emergency Department Visits: Comparing Characteristics and Outcomes.', 'Evaluation of the Impact of the Urgent Cancer Care Clinic on Emergency Department Visits, Primary Care Clinician Visits, and Hospitalizations in Winnipeg, Manitoba.', 'Frailty and medical financial hardship among older adults with cancer in the United States.', 'Optimal care of people with brain cancer in the emergency department: A cross-sectional survey of outpatient perceptions.', 'Integration of Remote Symptom and Biometric Monitoring Into the Care of Adult Patients With Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy-A Decentralized Feasibility Pilot Study.', 'Cardiovascular Reasons for Access to a Tertiary Oncological Emergency Service: The CARILLON Study.']"""

Peptide B-8R killed both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells that expressed sGCα1, but not cells that do not express this gene. Peptide B-8R induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Importantly, Peptide B-8R does not affect nor its cytotoxicity depend on NO signaling, despite the fact that it associates with sGCα1, which dimerizes with sGCβ1 to form the sGC enzyme. Just as with a previously studied Peptide A-8R, Peptide B-8R induced elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in prostate cancer cells, but using a ROS-sequestering agent showed that ROS was not responsible the cytotoxic activity of Peptide B-8R. Interestingly, Peptide B-8R induced elevated levels of p53 and phosphorylated p38, but neither of these changes is the cause of the peptide's cytotoxicity.

The two-compartment exchange model (2CXM) describes the compartments 'plasma' and 'interstitial volume' and their exchange in terms of plasma flow and capillary permeability. The model function can be defined by either a system of two coupled differential equations or a closed-form analytical solution. The aim of this study was to compare these two representations in terms of accuracy, robustness and computation speed, depending on parameter combination and temporal sampling. The impact on parameter estimation errors was investigated by fitting the 2CXM to simulated concentration-time curves. Parameter combinations representing five tissue types were used, together with two arterial input functions, a measured and a theoretical population based one, to generate 4D concentration images at three different temporal resolutions. Images were fitted by NLLS techniques, where the sum of squared residuals was calculated by either numeric integration with the Runge-Kutta method or convolution. Furthermore two example cases, a prostate carcinoma and a glioblastoma multiforme patient, were analyzed in order to investigate the validity of our findings in real patient data. The convolution approach yields improved results in precision and robustness of determined parameters. Precision and stability are limited in curves with low blood flow. The model parameter v e shows great instability and little reliability in all cases. Decreased temporal resolution results in significant errors for the differential equation approach in several curve types. The convolution excelled in computational speed by three orders of magnitude. Uncertainties in parameter estimation at low temporal resolution cannot be compensated by usage of the differential equations. Fitting with the convolution approach is superior in computational time, with better stability and accuracy at the same time.""","""['C Debus', 'R Floca', 'D Nörenberg', 'A Abdollahi', 'M Ingrisch']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters from DCE-MRI by extracting long and short time-dependent features using an LSTM network.', 'Accuracy of gamma-variate fits to concentration-time curves from dynamic susceptibility-contrast enhanced MRI: influence of time resolution, maximal signal drop and signal-to-noise.', 'Modeling DCE-MRI at low temporal resolution: a case study on rheumatoid arthritis.', 'A systematic investigation into the reliability of inter-temporal choice model parameters.', 'Analytical solution of linear multi-compartment models with non-zero initial condition and its implementation with R.', 'Convolutional Neural Networks for Direct Inference of Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Application to Stroke Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI.', 'MITK-ModelFit: A generic open-source framework for model fits and their exploration in medical imaging - design, implementation and application on the example of DCE-MRI.', 'Carbon ion radiotherapy: impact of tumor differentiation on local control in experimental prostate carcinomas.']"""

Materials and methods:   From 2014 to 2016, 865 men underwent prostate MRI and MRI/ultrasound (US) fusion biopsy (FB). A subset of 90 FB-naïve men with 96 PI-RADSv2 category 3 TZ lesions was identified. Patients were imaged at 3 T using a body coil. Images were assigned a PI-RADSv2 category by an experienced radiologist. Using clinical data and imaging features, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses to identify predictors of clinically significant PCA.  Results:   The mean patient age was 66 years, and the mean prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) was 0.13 ng/mL2. PCA was detected in 34 of 96 (35%) lesions, 14 of which (15%) harbored clinically significant PCA. In univariate analysis, DWI score, prostate volume, and PSAD were significant predictors (p < 0.05) of clinically significant PCA with a suggested significance for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and prostate-specific antigen value (p < 0.10). On multivariate analysis, PSAD and lesion ADC were the most important covariates.

Data source, study design, data extraction:   Secondary data analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked to Medicare claims among patients diagnosed with colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers, 2007-2011. We estimated cancer-attributable costs using three alternative reference cohorts: (1) noncancer Medicare patients individually matched by demographic characteristics, (2) noncancer patients individually matched on demographic factors and comorbidity score, (3) cancer patients as their own control, using prediagnosis costs.  Principal findings:   Among 44,266 colorectal, 61,584 lung, 55,921 breast, and 67,733 prostate patients, mean total Medicare spending in the first year of diagnosis was $59,496, $54,261, $31,895, and $26,305, respectively. Estimates of cancer-attributable costs ranged from 79 percent to 82 percent of spending for colorectal, 76 percent-79 percent for lung, 65 percent-74 percent for breast, and 60 percent-75 percent for prostate cancers, depending on the reference cohort used. For all cancers, estimates were higher when patients were used as their own control, compared to demographic and comorbidity-matched controls.

Methods:   Between 2002 and 2012, 746 consecutive patients underwent RP for clinically localized prostate cancer. We defined UI according to International Continence Society (ICS) definition: ""the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine"" after 12 months of recovery, international consultation on incontinence questionnaire (ICIQ-SF) and pads/day was collected too. Clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging measurements were assessed. A multivariable logistic regression model predicting incontinence were built-in after adjust by cofounding factors and bootstrapping.  Results:   About 172 (23%) of the patients were classified as incontinent according to the ICS definition. The mean value of the ICIQ-SF was 10.87 (±4). 17.8% of patients use at least one pad/day, 11.9% use more than one pad/day. The preoperative factors independently influential in UI are: age [OR: 1.055; CI 95% (1.006-1.107), p = .028], urethral wall thickness [OR: 5.03; CI 95% (1.11-22.8), p = .036], history of transurethral resection of the prostate [OR: 6.13; CI 95% (1.86-20.18), p = .003] and membranous urethral length [OR: 0.173; CI 95% (0.046-0.64), p = .009].

Methods:   This nationwide Swedish population-based cohort study from 1997 to 2014 analysed weekday of elective surgery for ten major cancers in relation to disease-specific and all-cause mortality. Cox regression provided hazard ratios with 95 per cent confidence intervals, adjusted for the co-variables age, sex, co-morbidity, hospital volume, calendar year and tumour stage.  Results:   A total of 228 927 patients were included. Later weekday of surgery (Thursdays and, even more so, Fridays) was associated with increased mortality rates for gastrointestinal cancers. Adjusted hazard ratios for disease-specific mortality, comparing surgery on Friday with that on Monday, were 1·57 (95 per cent c.i. 1·31 to 1·88) for oesophagogastric cancer, 1·49 (1·17 to 1·88) for liver/pancreatic/biliary cancer and 1·53 (1·44 to 1·63) for colorectal cancer. Excluding mortality during the initial 90 days of surgery made little difference to these findings, and all-cause mortality was similar to disease-specific mortality. The associations were similar in analyses stratified for co-variables. No consistent associations were found between weekday of surgery and prognosis for cancer of the head and neck, lung, thyroid, breast, kidney/bladder, prostate or ovary/uterus.

Therefore, this cohort study aimed to find the relationship between antiarrhythmic drug usage and the subsequent PCa risk using a population-based dataset.

Each patient was tracked for a 5-year period to define those who were subsequently diagnosed with PCa. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and age, Cox proportional hazard regressions found that the hazard ratio (HR) of subsequent PCa for sodium channel blocker users was 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84-1.50), for potassium channel blocker users was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.59-1.34), for beta-blocker users was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.96-1.22), for calcium channel blocker users was 1.14 (95% CI: 0.95-1.36), and for digoxin users was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.67-1.18), compared to their matched nonusers.

Methods:   A single institution retrospective study of 116 men with prostate cancer treated with HDR monotherapy from 2010 to 2015 was conducted. Eighty-one men had 7.25 Gy × 6-fractions and 35 men had 13.5 Gy × 2-fractions. Patients had two CT-planned implants spaced 1-2 weeks apart. Patient baseline characteristics, International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) scores were collected pre-treatment and 3, 6 and 12 months post-implantation. Mixed effect modelling was undertaken to compare baseline, 1-6 month and 7-12 month scores between groups. Poisson regression analysis was performed to correlate dosimetric constraints with acute toxicity.  Results:   There was no difference between baseline and post-implantation IPSS scores between 6-fraction and 2-fraction groups. SHIM scores for men treated with 6-fractions had a steeper decline at 1-6 months, but resolved at 7-12 months. Pre-treatment alpha-blocker use correlated with worse short-term acute urinary toxicity. Worsened SHIM score correlated with increasing age, diabetes mellitus and androgen-deprivation therapy. In a dosimetric analysis of outcomes, prostate V150 dose and bladder wall (D01.cc, D1cc, D2cc) dose correlated with increased IPSS score.  Conclusion:   No increased acute genitourinary or sexual dysfunction has been observed in men when transitioning from 6-fraction to 2-fraction HDR monotherapy.

We designed a case-control study nested within a cohort of men treated by medical drugs licensed for symptomatic BPH between 2010 and 2011. Cases were patients with incident PCa diagnosed between 2012 and 2013 identified through French Health database (SNIIRAM). Gleason score was searched through Brittany pathology laboratories. Controls were patients without PCa diagnosis. Local pathology laboratories database was constituted in Brittany, gathering Gleason scores. No unique identification number is available in France; linkage of SNIIRAM and Brittany pathology laboratories database was made by deterministic matching. We matched 859 cases to Gleason grading (119 had Gleason score ≥8 and 740 had Gleason <8); around 22% of cases received 5-ARI and 78% α-blockers or phytotherapy. The CANARI study investigated in a population of men treated for BPH the risk of PCa with 5-ARI, according to Gleason grade thanks to SNIIRAM database enriched by local pathological results.""","""['Lucie-Marie Scailteux', 'Frédéric Balusson', 'Sébastien Vincendeau', 'Nathalie Rioux-Leclercq', 'Emmanuel Nowak']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Fundam Clin Pharmacol""","""['Use of 5α-reductase inhibitors for benign prostate hypertrophy and risk of high grade prostate cancer: a French population-based study.', 'French administrative health care database (SNDS): The value of its enrichment.', 'BPH: a tell-tale sign of prostate cancer?

Methods:   The COLD registry is comprised of a combination of retrospectively and prospectively collected data on patients undergoing primary and SCAP. Patients with local recurrence after radiation therapy were identified. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate ADT-free survival.  Results:   We identified 898 patients that have undergone SCAP in the COLD registry. Overall, the calculated 5-year ADT-free survival probability was 0.713. When stratified by D'Amico risk group, 264 high-risk patients (71.9%), 234 intermediate-risk (86.7%),and 228 low-risk (87.7%) were free of ADT post-SCAP. This correlates with a 5-year ADT-free survival of 60.7, 73.9, and 82.4%, respectively. Patients with post-SCAP PSA nadir of <0.2 ng/mL had a 5 year ADT-free survival of 87.1% compared to 48.7% with a PSA nadir ≥0.2 ng/mL. Pre-operative ADT use or full versus partial gland SCAP did not have an effect on ADT use post-operatively. In 118 (55.4%) of patients with post-operative biochemical recurrence, ADT was not used.  Conclusion:   For patients with local recurrence after radiation, SCAP is an option that provides a high chance of avoiding or delaying ADT. The potential to delay ADT and its associated side effects should be a part of counseling sessions with the patient when discussing treatment options for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiation. Avoidance of ADT is more clinically relevant than PSA elevation.""","""['Kevin B Ginsburg', 'Ahmed Elshafei', 'Changhong Yu', 'J Stephen Jones', 'Michael L Cher']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The Effect of Androgen Deprivation Therapy Before Salvage Whole-gland Cryoablation After Primary Radiation Failure in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Use of Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients Treated with Early Salvage Radiotherapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: Long-term Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Series.', 'Combination of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Salvage Radiotherapy versus Salvage Radiotherapy Alone for Recurrent Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Management of Biochemical Recurrence after Primary Curative Treatment for Prostate Cancer: A Review.', 'Management Options for Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Management of Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Curative Treatment: A Focus on Older Patients.', 'Systematic Review of Focal and Salvage Cryotherapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

In this study, we investigated the effect of PA on the growth and apoptosis of human immortalized cell line (HOS) and primary osteosarcoma cells by a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining, respectively. Western blot was used to measure the expression of cleaved Caspase 3, PTEN, and AKT, as well as the AKT phosphorylation. The Caspase 3 activity was determined using the Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assay Kit. From the results, PA significantly reduced cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. PA also induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion. PA treatment led to increased Caspase 3 activation and PTEN expression, as well as reduced AKT phosphorylation. Moreover, Ac-DEVD-CHO (a Caspase 3/7 inhibitor) pre-treatment or PTEN knockdown partially blocked the effects of PA on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Caspase 3/7 inhibitor had an additive effect with PTEN knockdown. Collectively, our results suggested that induction of apoptosis by PA was mediated in part by PTEN/AKT signaling and Caspase 3/7 activity.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether TRAF2 is a valuable prognostic biomarker and to determine if it regulates TRAIL-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Microarray gene expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were used to determine TRAF2 expression in prostate cancer. TRAF2 expression in prostate cancer was further investigated by immunohistochemistry assay. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test were used to assess the recurrence-free rate. Cox regression was used to analyze prognostic factors. Effects of TRAF2 on regulating TRAIL-induced apoptosis in DU-145 cells were further investigated. RESULTS We found that TRAF2 was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate samples (P<0.001). In addition, compared with primary prostate cancer, TRAF2 was upregulated in metastatic prostate cancer (P=0.006). Furthermore, our results showed that high expression of TRAF2 was significantly associated with tumor stage of prostate cancer (P=0.035). TRAF2 high expression was associated with poorer recurrence-free survival in prostate cancer patients (P=0.013). TRAF2 was found to be a valuable independent prognostic factor for predicting recurrence-free survival (P=0.026). In addition, the present results indicate that TRAF2 affects TRAIL-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer DU-145 cells via regulating cleaved Caspase-8 and c-Flip expression.

GTPases may be activated by guanosine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). GEFs of the cytohesin family may indirectly activate Rac, or ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPases directly. Here we investigated the expression of cytohesin family GEFs and effects of the cytohesin inhibitor Sec7 inhibitor H3 (secinH3) on smooth muscle contraction and GTPase activities in human prostate tissues. Of all four cytohesin isoforms, cytohesin-1 and -2 showed the highest expression in real-time PCR. Western blot and fluorescence staining suggested that cytohesin-2 may be the predominant isoform in prostate smooth muscle cells. Contractions induced by norepinephrine, the α1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine, the thromboxane A2 analog U-46619 , and endothelin-1 and -3, as well as neurogenic contractions induced by electric field stimulation (EFS), were reduced by secinH3 (30 µM). Inhibition of EFS-induced contractions appeared to have efficacy similar to that of inhibition by the α1-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin (300 nM). Combined application of secinH3 plus tamsulosin caused larger inhibition of EFS-induced contractions than tamsulosin alone. Pull-down assays demonstrated inhibition of the small monomeric GTPase ARF6 by secinH3, but no inhibition of RhoA or Rac1. In conclusion, we suggest that a cytohesin-ARF6 pathway takes part in smooth muscle contraction.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether methylation of pericentromeric repeat NBL2 and subtelomeric repeat D4Z4 in peripheral blood was associated with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa). We measured the methylation status of different CpG sites of NBL2 and D4Z4 in 795 PCa patients and compared their methylation levels among patients with different Gleason Score at diagnosis. We then analyzed the association of the NBL2 and D4Z4 methylation with the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) in patients receiving radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. In addition, we used the Kaplan-Meier survival function and log-rank tests to assess BCR-free survival associated with D4Z4 methylation. There was no significant difference in methylation level of NBL2 and D4Z4 between clinically defined aggressive and non-aggressive PCa at diagnosis. However, the methylation of D4Z4 was associated with BCR, while the methylation of NBL2 was not. In tertile analysis, patients in the highest tertile of D4Z4 methylation had an increased risk of BCR (HR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.36-3.48) compared to patients in the lower tertiles after adjustment of age, body mass index, smoking status, pack year, D'Amico risk groups and treatments. Among the four CpG sites in this region, the association was mostly attributable to the methylation of the second CpG site of D4Z4.

The study population contains all men and women aged 40 years or older during follow-up. Individual SEP is measured using education, employment status and housing conditions. Neighborhood SEP is measured by a deprivation index (in quintiles). Directly age-standardized mortality rates and multilevel Poisson models are used to estimate the association between individual SEP and neighborhood deprivation and mortality from all-cancer and cancer of the lung, colon and rectum, pancreas, prostate and female breast. The potential confounding role of population density is assessed using multilevel models as well. Our findings show an increase in mortality from all-cancer and site-specific cancer by decreasing level of individual SEP for both men and women. In addition, individuals living in highly deprived neighborhoods experience significantly higher mortality from all-cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and female colorectal cancer after controlling for individual SEP. Male colorectal and prostate cancer and female breast cancer are not associated with neighborhood deprivation. Population density acts as a confounder for female lung cancer only.

Another attractive therapeutic approach is to further increase the oxidative stress in cancer cells leading to cell death. Herein, we show that Procyanidin B2 3,3″-di-O-gallate (B2G2), the most active constituent of grape seed extract, treatment causes cell death in human prostate cancer (PCa) cells (LNCaP and 22Rv1) via increasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Mechanistically, B2G2 treatment decreased the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex III activity leading to enhanced mitochondrial superoxide generation and decreased ATP production in LNCaP cells. Additional molecular studies revealed that B2G2-induced cell death was mediated mainly through ROS-induced sustained activation of ERK1/2, which was due to inhibition of MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP) activity as over-expression of MKP3 in LNCaP cells conferred significant protection against B2G2-induced cell death. Along with ERK1/2, AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) was also activated by B2G2 treatment, and pre-treatment with AMPKα inhibitor compound C significantly reversed the cytotoxic effects of B2G2 in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, pre-treatment of MKP3 over-expressing LNCaP cells with compound C further reduced the B2G2-induced cell death, suggesting the involvement of AMPKα along with MKP3 and ERK1/2 in the biological effects of B2G2. Together, these results for the first time identified that oxidative stress and MKP3 inhibition play a critical role in B2G2-induced cell death in PCa cells through sustained activation of both ERK1/2 and AMPKα.

This contrasts with the phenotype of mice with prostate-specific deletion of Pten, where excessive PI-3 kinase signaling induces both PIN and locally invasive carcinoma. We reasoned that additional PI-3 kinase effector kinases promote prostate cancer progression via activities that provide biological complementarity to AKT. We focused on the PKN kinase family members, which undergo activation in response to PI-3 kinase signaling, show expression changes in prostate cancer, and contribute to cell motility pathways in cancer cells.  Methods:   PKN kinase activity was measured by incorporation of 32 P into protein substrates. Phosphorylation of the turn-motif (TM) in PKN proteins by mTOR was analyzed using the TORC2-specific inhibitor torin and a PKN1 phospho-TM-specific antibody. Amino acid substitutions in the TM of PKN were engineered and assayed for effects on kinase activity. Cell motility-related functions and PKN localization was analyzed by depletion approaches and immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. The contribution of PKN proteins to prostate tumorigenesis was characterized in several mouse models that express PKN transgenes. The requirement for PKN activity in prostate cancer initiated by loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (Pten), and the potential redundancy between PKN isoforms, was analyzed by prostate-specific deletion of Pkn1, Pkn2, and Pten.  Results and conclusions:   PKN1 and PKN2 contribute to motility pathways in human prostate cancer cells. PKN1 and PKN2 kinase activity is regulated by TORC2-dependent phosphorylation of the TM, which together with published data indicates that PKN proteins receive multiple PI-3 kinase-dependent inputs. Transgenic expression of active AKT and PKN1 is not sufficient for progression beyond PIN. Moreover, Pkn1 is not required for tumorigenesis initiated by loss of Pten. Triple knockout of Pten, Pkn1, and Pkn2 in mouse prostate results in squamous cell carcinoma, an uncommon but therapy-resistant form of prostate cancer.""","""['Chun-Song Yang', 'Tiffany A Melhuish', 'Adam Spencer', 'Li Ni', 'Yi Hao', 'Kasey Jividen', 'Thurl E Harris', 'Chelsi Snow', 'Henry F Frierson Jr', 'David Wotton', 'Bryce M Paschal']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Protein Kinase N Promotes Stress-Induced Cardiac Dysfunction Through Phosphorylation of Myocardin-Related Transcription Factor A and Disruption of Its Interaction With Actin.', 'AKT-mediated stabilization of histone methyltransferase WHSC1 promotes prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Depletion of SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase suppresses prostate tumorigenesis via inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis.', 'Pten inactivation and the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Dissecting the signaling pathways that mediate cancer in PTEN and LKB1 double-knockout mice.', 'PKN1 Kinase: A Key Player in Adipocyte Differentiation and Glucose Metabolism.', 'Upregulation of PKN1 as a Prognosis Biomarker for Endometrial Cancer.', 'Disruption of pancreatic stellate cell myofibroblast phenotype promotes pancreatic tumor invasion.', 'Protein kinase N1 promotes proliferation and invasion of liver cancer.', 'mTORC2 controls the activity of PKC and Akt by phosphorylating a conserved TOR interaction motif.']"""

Design:   Cross sectional.  Setting:   Clalit Health Services (CHS), Israel's largest health maintenance organization (HMO), provides care for more than half of the country's population and operates a national age-based programs for cancer screening.  Participants:   All community-dwelling members aged 65 to 79 in 2014 (N = 370,876).  Measurements:   We used CHS data warehouse to evaluate cancer screening during 2014. Life expectancy (LE) was estimated using the validated Schonberg index.  Results:   Almost one-quarter (23.1%; 15.6% of adults aged 65-74, 42.7% of adults aged 75-79) of the study population had an estimated LE of less than 10 years. Annual fecal occult blood test and biannual mammography rates among adults aged 65 to 74 with a LE of 10 years or longer were 37.1% and 70.0%, respectively. Rates dropped after age 75 (4.0%, 19.5%) and to a lesser extent with a LE of less than 10 years (31.6%, 56.4%). Prostate-specific antigen testing is not part of the national screening program, and the proportion of people tested (42.6%), did not vary similarly with age of 75 and older (43.2%) or LE of less than 10 years (38.1%).  Conclusion:   The cancer screening inclusion criteria of the national referral system have a strong effect on receipt of screening; LE considerations are less influential. Some method of estimating LE could be incorporated into algorithms to improve individualized cancer screening to reduce over- and underscreening of older adults.""","""['Ronen Bareket', 'Mara A Schonberg', 'Doron Comaneshter', 'Yochai Schonmann', 'Michal Shani', 'Arnon Cohen', 'Shlomo Vinker']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Am Geriatr Soc""","""['Colon cancer screening in U.S. adults aged 65 and older according to life expectancy and age.', 'How Do Older Adults Consider Age, Life Expectancy, Quality of Life, and Physician Recommendations When Making Cancer Screening Decisions?

Lack of experimental tools that predict therapy response is one of the limitations of current therapeutic regimens. Mitochondrial dysfunctions including defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cancer inhibit apoptosis by modulating ROS production and cellular signaling. Thus, correction of mitochondrial dysfunction and induction of apoptosis are promising strategies in cancer treatment. We have used Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to quantify mitochondrial metabolic response in PCa cells by tracking auto-fluorescent NAD(P)H, FAD and tryptophan (Trp) lifetimes and their enzyme-bound fractions as markers, before and after treatment with anti-cancer drug doxorubicin. A 3-channel FLIM assay and quantitative analysis of these markers for cellular metabolism show in response to doxorubicin, NAD(P)H mean fluorescence lifetime (τm) and enzyme-bound (a2%) fraction increased, FAD enzyme-bound (a1%) fraction was decreased, NAD(P)H-a2%/FAD-a1% FLIM-based redox ratio and ROS increased, followed by induction of apoptosis. For the first time, a FRET assay in PCa cells shows Trp-quenching due to Trp-NAD(P)H interactions, correlating energy transfer efficiencies (E%) vs NAD(P)H-a2%/FAD-a1% as sensitive parameters in predicting drug response. Applying this FLIM assay as early predictor of drug response would meet one of the important goals in cancer treatment.""","""['Shagufta Rehman Alam', 'Horst Wallrabe', 'Zdenek Svindrych', 'Ajay K Chaudhary', 'Kathryn G Christopher', 'Dhyan Chandra', 'Ammasi Periasamy']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Single-cell redox states analyzed by fluorescence lifetime metrics and tryptophan FRET interaction with NAD(P)H.', 'Multiphoton FLIM imaging of NAD(P)H and FAD with one excitation wavelength.', 'Segmented cell analyses to measure redox states of autofluorescent NAD(P)H, FAD & Trp in cancer cells by FLIM.', 'Evaluating Cell Metabolism Through Autofluorescence Imaging of NAD(P)H and FAD.', 'Intracellular coenzymes as natural biomarkers for metabolic activities and mitochondrial anomalies.', 'Mitochondrial DNA-targeted therapy: A novel approach to combat cancer.', 'Comparison of phasor analysis and biexponential decay curve fitting of autofluorescence lifetime imaging data for machine learning prediction of cellular phenotypes.', ""Development of a 3D Tumor Spheroid Model from the Patient's Glioblastoma Cells and Its Study by Metabolic Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging."", 'Flavin fluorescence lifetime and autofluorescence optical redox ratio for improved visualization and classification of brain tumors.', ""Effect of Collagen Matrix on Doxorubicin Distribution and Cancer Cells' Response to Treatment in 3D Tumor Model.""]"""

In this context, a better understanding of metastasis and resistance mechanisms in PCa is an important issue. As phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss is the most common genetic lesion in such cancer, we investigate human data sets for mechanisms that can constrain cancer evolution in this setting. Here we report a liver X receptor (LXR) signature, which tightly correlates with PTEN loss, in PCa. Accordingly, the LXR pathway is deregulated in prostate carcinomas in Pten-null mice. Genetic ablation of LXRs in Pten-null mice, exacerbates PCa invasiveness and metastatic dissemination, which involves mesenchymal transition and accumulation of matrix metalloproteinases. Mechanistically, PTEN deletion governed LXR transcriptional activity through deregulation of cholesterol de novo synthesis, resulting in accumulation of endogenous LXR ligands. Our study therefore reveals a functional circuit linking PTEN and LXR, and highlights LXRs as metabolic gatekeepers that are able to constrain PCa progression.Treatment of prostate cancer, especially in its advanced stage, is still challenging; therefore, strategies to prevent metastatic dissemination are of great interest.

Aims:   To determine the relation between UI and moderate to severe ED and the risk factors for UI in patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.  Methods:   Patients in our institutional database who underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for prostate cancer (2006-2013) and who completed the University of California-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index and the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) surveys at 12 months after prostatectomy were eligible for inclusion. Men who reported use of no urinary pads per day were considered continent, whereas men who used at least one pad per day were considered incontinent. Men with moderate to severe ED based on a SHIM score no higher than 11 were considered to have ED. Patients who had preoperative moderate to severe ED and/or UI based on these definitions were excluded from further analysis.  Outcomes:   A better understanding of what increases the risk for UI after a prostatectomy and how it can co-occur with ED.  Results:   We analyzed 464 patients who met the inclusion criteria. After prostatectomy, 36% of patients had UI and 47% of patients had moderate to severe ED. Of all patients with ED, 45% (98 of 216) were incontinent compared with 27% (67 of 248) of patients without ED (P < .001). On multivariable analysis, older age at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, P = .002) and ED (OR = 1.88, P = .005) were independent predictors for incontinence. The use of unilateral nerve sparing (OR = 1.03, P = .94) or no nerve sparing (OR = 0.53, P = .50) during surgery did not have an impact on postoperative incontinence.  Clinical implications:   Understanding that ED is an independent predictor of UI after robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy has important clinical implications and suggests a common anatomic pathway.  Strengths and limitations:   Our focus on different measurements of incontinence and their relation to ED and our use of validated questionnaires to define incontinence and ED were important strengths of this study. Limitations of our study include its retrospective nature and the fact that our results were drawn from a single-center database of a tertiary referral hospital.  Conclusion:   Our results show that the presence of moderate to severe ED after prostatectomy is an independent risk factor for incontinence, suggesting a possible common pathway for these two complications. Further studies to investigate the anatomic and clinical bases of this relation are warranted. Tsikis ST, Nottingham CU, Faris SF.

The aim of our study was to describe the preventive practices of French-speaking primary care physicians.  Methods:   A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2015 in a randomly selected sample of 1100 primary care physicians (700 in Switzerland, 400 in France). The physicians were asked how often they performed the following recommended preventive practices: blood pressure, weight and height measurements, screening for dyslipidemia, screening for alcohol use and brief intervention, screening for smoking (and brief advice for smokers), colon and prostate cancer screening, and influenza immunization. Response options on the five points Likert scale were never, rarely, sometimes, often, always. The physicians were considered to be performing the preventive practice regularly if they declared performing it often or always.  Results:   518 participants (47%) returned the questionnaire. The most commonly reported preventive practices were: blood pressure measurement (99%), screening for smoking (95%) and brief advice for smokers (95%). The least frequently reported practices were annual influenza immunization for at-risk patients <65 years (37%), height measurement (53%), screening for excessive alcohol use (60%) and brief advice for at-risk drinkers (67%). All other practices were reported by 70 to 90% of participants.

Design, setting, and participants:   From January 2014 until May 2016 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 10 336 patients consented to tumor DNA sequencing. Since May 2015, 1040 of these patients with advanced cancer were referred by their oncologists for germline analysis of 76 cancer predisposition genes. Patients with clinically actionable inherited mutations whose genetic test results would not have been predicted by published decision rules were identified. Follow-up for potential clinical implications of mutation detection was through May 2017.  Exposure:   Tumor and germline sequencing compared with the predicted yield of targeted germline sequencing based on clinical guidelines.  Main outcomes and measures:   Proportion of clinically actionable germline mutations detected by universal tumor-normal sequencing that would not have been detected by guideline-directed testing.  Results:   Of 1040 patients, the median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50.5-66 years), 65.3% were male, and 81.3% had stage IV disease at the time of genomic analysis, with prostate, renal, pancreatic, breast, and colon cancer as the most common diagnoses. Of the 1040 patients, 182 (17.5%; 95% CI, 15.3%-19.9%) had clinically actionable mutations conferring cancer susceptibility, including 149 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations; 101 patients tested (9.7%; 95% CI, 8.1%-11.7%) would not have had these mutations detected using clinical guidelines, including 65 with moderate- to high-penetrance mutations.

Nevertheless, detailed mechanism of the action of this compound in prostate cancer has not been elucidated yet.

It was found that the treatment of DU145 cells with carvacrol decreased cell viability in a concentration and time-dependent manner. The antiproliferative action of carvacrol leads to induction of apoptosis as confirmed by nuclear condensation, Annexin V-FITC/PI positive cells, and caspase-3 activation. In addition, carvacrol augmented reactive oxygen species generation and disruption in the mitochondrial membrane potential which has not been reported in the previous studies of carvacrol with prostate cancer. Moreover, carvacrol-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells was also accompanied by significant amount of growth arrest at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle which has also not been documented previously.

Patients with demonstrable intraoperative leakage upon bladder irrigation were excluded. Randomisation sequence was determined a priori using a computer algorithm, and included a stratified design with respect to low vs intermediate/high D'Amico risk classifications. Surgeons remained blinded to the randomisation arm until final eligibility was verified at the end of the RARP. The primary endpoint was overall incidence of 90-day complications which, based on our standard treatment using PD retrospectively, was estimated at 13%. The non-inferiority margin was set at 10%, and the planned sample size was 312.

Patients and methods:   In a multicentre randomized controlled trial, 100 men who had previously undergone either 6 months (short-term) or 18 months (long-term) of ADT in combination with radiotherapy, as part of the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial, were randomized to 6 months supervised exercise, followed by a 6-month home-based maintenance programme, or to printed physical activity educational material for 12 months across 13 university-affiliated exercise clinics in Australia and New Zealand. The participants were long-term survivors of PCa with a mean age of 71.7 ± 6.4 years, and were assessed for lower extremity performance (repeated chair rise), with a subset of men (n = 57) undergoing additional measures for upper and lower body muscle strength and body composition (lean mass, fat mass, appendicular skeletal muscle [ASM]) by dual X-ray absorptiometry. Data were analysed using generalized estimating equations.  Results:   Time on ADT significantly moderated the exercise effects on chair rise (βinteraction = -1.3 s, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.6 to 0.0), whole-body lean mass (βinteraction = 1194 g, 95% CI 234 to 2153) and ASM mass (βinteraction = 562 g, 95% CI 49 to 1075), and approached significance for fat mass (βinteraction = -1107 g, 95% CI -2346 to 132), with greater benefits for men previously on long-term ADT. At 6 months, the intervention effects on chair rise time -1.5 s (95% CI -2.5 to -0.5), whole-body lean mass 824 g (95% CI 8 to 1640), ASM mass 709 g (95% CI 260 to 1158), and fat mass -1377 g (95% CI -2156 to -598) were significant for men previously on long-term ADT, but not for men on short-term ADT. At 12 months, the intervention effects for men on long-term ADT remained significant for the chair rise, with improved performance (-2.0 s, 95% CI -3.0 to -1.0) and increased ASM (537 g, 95% CI 153 to 921). Time on ADT did not moderate the exercise effects on muscle strength, nor did time since ADT cessation moderate any intervention effects. Similarly, testosterone and baseline values of the outcome had negligible moderator effects.  Conclusions:   Men with PCa previously treated long-term with ADT respond more favourably to exercise in terms of lower body muscle performance and body composition (lean and fat mass, and ASM) than those with short-term ADT exposure. As a result, men who were formerly on long-term androgen suppression regimens should be especially prescribed exercise medicine interventions to alleviate residual treatment-related adverse effects.""","""['Dennis R Taaffe', 'Laurien M Buffart', 'Robert U Newton', 'Nigel Spry', 'James Denham', 'David Joseph', 'David Lamb', 'Suzanne K Chambers', 'Daniel A Galvão']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['A multicentre year-long randomised controlled trial of exercise training targeting physical functioning in men with prostate cancer previously treated with androgen suppression and radiation from TROG 03.04 RADAR.', 'Immediate versus delayed exercise in men initiating androgen deprivation: effects on bone density and soft tissue composition.', 'Impact of resistance training on body composition and metabolic syndrome variables during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a pilot randomized controlled trial.', 'Muscle function, physical performance and body composition changes in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on body composition in men with prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'ExPeCT: a randomised trial examining the impact of exercise on quality of life in men with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Exercise interventions for adults with cancer receiving radiation therapy alone.', 'The effects of exercise on body composition of prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy: An update systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Do Patients with Prostate Cancer Benefit from Exercise Interventions?

Purpose:   To develop a prebiopsy multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)-based risk score (RS) and a statistical equation for predicting the risk of PCa in biopsy-naive men with serum PSA between 4-10 ng/mL that may help reduce unnecessary biopsies.  Study type:   Prospective cross-sectional study.  Subjects:   In all, 137 consecutive men with PSA between 4-10 ng/mL underwent prebiopsy mpMRI (diffusion-weighted [DW]-MRI and MR spectroscopic imaging [MRSI]) during 2009-2015 were recruited for this study.  Field strength/sequence:   1.5T (Avanto, Siemens Health Care, Erlangen, Germany); T1 -weighted, T2 -weighted, DW-MRI, and MRSI sequences were used.  Assessment:   All eligible patients underwent mpMRI-directed, cognitive-fusion transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies.  Statistical tests:   An equation model and an RS were developed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and a multivariable logistic regression approach. A 10-fold crossvalidation and simulation analyses were performed to assess diagnostic performance of various combinations of mpMRI parameters.  Results:   Of 137 patients, 32 were diagnosed with PCa on biopsy. Multivariable analysis, adjusted with positive pathology, showed apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), metabolite ratio, and PSA as significant predictors of PCa (P < 0.05). A statistical equation was derived using these predictors. A simple 6-point mpMRI-based RS was derived for calculating the risk of PCa and it showed that it is highly predictive for PCa (odds ratio = 3.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.24-6.27, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.87). Both models (equation and RS) yielded high predictive performance (AUC ≥0.85) on validation analysis.  Data conclusion:   A statistical equation and a simple 6-point mpMRI-based RS can be used as a point-of-care tool to potentially help limit the number of negative biopsies in men with PSA between 4 and 10 ng/mL.

We investigated the implementation of a low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy program for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) in a low-resource setting such as Puerto Rico (PR), where PCa is the main cause of cancer-associated death.  Methods and materials:   After institutional approval, the medical records of patients with nonmetastatic PCa undergoing LDR brachytherapy from 2008 to 2013 were reviewed from PR. The factors analyzed included adequate D90 (radiation dose delivered to 90% of the target volume) coverage (≥140 Gy), early and late toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade >2), and prostate-specific antigen failure. Freedom from biochemical failure was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results:   The barriers to implementation of LDR brachytherapy in a country with limited resources were identified. These included lack of access to funding for startup costs, specific referral patterns, lack of trained support staff, such as dosimetrists and physicists, and initial opposition from insurance companies for reimbursement. The initial results from 191 patients were included in the present study with a median follow-up period of 26 months. Prostate-specific antigen failure occurred in 6 patients (3%). No early or late gastrointestinal toxicity (grade >2) developed. Only 3 (2%) and 2 (1%) patients experienced early and late genitourinary toxicity (grade >2), respectively. The 2- and 3-year freedom from biochemical failure in this population was 97% and 95.9%, respectively.  Conclusions:   At present, limited data are available delineating the barriers faced by low-resource settings in the implementation of LDR brachytherapy. Our data highlight the issues unique to this environment and support the use of LDR brachytherapy as a reliable and effective treatment modality for patients with PCa in low-resource settings.""","""['Michelle I Echevarria', 'Arash O Naghavi', 'Yazan A Abuodeh', 'Kamran A Ahmed', 'Carlos Chevere', 'Daniel Fernandez', 'Kosj Yamoah']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['A new model using number of needles and androgen deprivation to predict chronic urinary toxicity for high or low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Biochemical Control and Toxicity Outcomes of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Versus Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy in the Treatment of Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Brachytherapy improves biochemical failure-free survival in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer compared with conventionally fractionated external beam radiation therapy: a propensity score matched analysis.', 'Curative radiotherapy of localized prostate cancer.

Method:   A search strategy was developed in consultation with prostate cancer survivors (n = 44) to reflect the most common ways they are likely to search the internet. The search was then conducted by a single reviewer, and identified websites were assessed for quality by two reviewers using an evidence-based quality assessment tool developed for this study.

Results:   Of the 45 identified websites, 13 (29%) received a high quality rating, 22 (49%) received a moderate rating and 10 (22%) received a low quality rating. Higher-quality websites tended to have a .org or .gov domain and tended to be located using searches specific to prostate cancer or prostate cancer and exercise. Very few websites contained complete information regarding the physical activity guidelines for cancer survivors, and no websites provided comprehensive behaviour change support.  Conclusion:   There are some good-quality physical activity websites accessible to men with prostate cancer.

Competing-risk or semi-competing-risk models are often deficient in describing the complex relationship between disease progression events which are driven by a shared progression stochastic process. A multi-stage model can only examine two stages at a time and thus fails to capture the effect of one stage on the time spent between other stages.

As measured by the 6-item MOS-Sleep (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale) survey we examined the relationship between sleep problems, and the development and progression of lower urinary tract symptoms in the REDUCE (Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events) study.  Materials and methods:   REDUCE was a randomized trial testing prostate cancer chemoprevention with dutasteride in men with prostate specific antigen 2.5 to 10 ng/ml and a negative biopsy. At baseline men completed MOS-Sleep and a scaled average was used to calculate the sleep score. Men were followed for 4 years and I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) was completed at baseline and every 6 months. Asymptomatic men had I-PSS less than 8 while symptomatic men had I-PSS 8 or greater. In the placebo arm of 2,588 men not receiving α-blockers or 5α-reductase inhibitors at baseline we tested the association between sleep problems and lower urinary tract symptom development and progression using Cox models.  Results:   During followup lower urinary tract symptoms developed in 209 of 1,452 asymptomatic men (14%) and 580 of 1,136 (51%) with lower urinary tract symptoms demonstrated progression. On multivariable analysis higher sleep scores were suggestively associated with increased lower urinary tract symptoms in asymptomatic men (quartile 4 vs 1 HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.92-2.17, p = 0.12) and with lower urinary tract symptom progression in symptomatic men (per 10 points of sleep score HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.12, p = 0.029).  Conclusions:   Among men with lower urinary tract symptoms worse sleep scores were associated with the progression of lower urinary tract symptoms and among asymptomatic men worse sleep scores were suggestively associated with the development of lower urinary tract symptoms. If confirmed, these data suggest that sleep problems may precede such symptoms. Whether treating sleep problems would improve lower urinary tract symptoms requires further testing.""","""['Brandee L Branche', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Daniel M Moreira', 'Claus Roehrborn', 'Ramiro Castro-Santamaria', 'Gerald L Andriole', 'Martin L Hopp', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Statin Use and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Incidence and Progression in Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) Trial.', 'Does Peak Urine Flow Rate Predict the Development of Incident Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Men with Mild to No Current Symptoms?

A Report from the SEARCH Database Group""","""Purpose:   Short prostate specific antigen doubling time following recurrence after radical prostatectomy portends a poor prognosis. Prostate specific antigen doubling time is traditionally calculated using prostate specific antigen values 0.2 ng/ml or greater. We determined whether early prostate specific antigen doubling time, calculated from the first detectable postoperative prostate specific antigen up to and including the first recurrence value, correlates with prostate cancer outcomes.  Materials and methods:   Cox models were used to examine the association between early prostate specific antigen doubling time and castration resistant prostate cancer, metastases, and all cause and prostate cancer specific mortality in 674 men who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1988 and 2014 and had a biochemical recurrence. Early prostate specific antigen doubling time was examined as a log transformed continuous and a categorical variable.  Results:   After adjusting for multiple clinicopathological characteristics, log transformed early prostate specific antigen doubling time was not associated with any outcome. However, when early doubling time was categorized as 15 or greater, 9 to 14.9, 3 to 8.9 and less than 3 months, on multivariable analysis men with early doubling time less than 3 months were at increased risk for castration resistant prostate cancer (HR 6.20, p = 0.004), metastases (HR 5.26, p = 0.001), prostate cancer specific mortality (HR 5.06, p = 0.026) and all cause mortality (HR 1.63, p = 0.065) compared to those with an early doubling time of 15 months or greater. However, the association with all cause mortality was not significant. Those with an early prostate specific antigen doubling time of 3 to 8.9 months were at increased risk for castration resistant prostate cancer (HR 3.56, p = 0.015), all cause mortality (HR 1.67, p = 0.006) and prostate cancer specific mortality (HR 3.17, p = 0.044) but not metastases (p = 0.13).  Conclusions:   Early prostate specific antigen doubling time less than 9 months, calculated using prostate specific antigen values before and up to biochemical recurrence, is associated with an increased risk of castration resistant prostate cancer, metastases, and prostate cancer specific and all cause mortality among men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Early prostate specific antigen doubling time allows for risk stratification at biochemical recurrence and before prostate specific antigen doubling time is calculable, enabling these men to be referred for early aggressive secondary treatment and/or clinical trials.""","""['Anna E Teeter', 'Kagan Griffin', 'Lauren E Howard', 'William J Aronson', 'Martha K Terris', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Christopher L Amling', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['What are the factors associated with short prostate specific antigen doubling time after radical prostatectomy?

However, resistance typically develops in about 1 year - a clinical condition termed metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We develop and investigate a spatial game (agent based continuous space) of mCRPC that considers three distinct cancer cell types: (1) those dependent on exogenous testosterone (T+), (2) those with increased CYP17A expression that produce testosterone and provide it to the environment as a public good (TP), and (3) those independent of testosterone (T-). The interactions within and between cancer cell types can be represented by a 3 × 3 matrix. Based on the known biology of this cancer there are 22 potential matrices that give roughly three major outcomes depending upon the absence (good prognosis), near absence or high frequency (poor prognosis) of T- cells at the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). When just two cell types coexist the spatial game faithfully reproduces the ESS of the corresponding matrix game. With three cell types divergences occur, in some cases just two strategies coexist in the spatial game even as a non-spatial matrix game supports all three. Discrepancies between the spatial game and non-spatial ESS happen because different cell types become more or less clumped in the spatial game - leading to non-random assortative interactions between cell types. Three key spatial scales influence the distribution and abundance of cell types in the spatial game: i. Increasing the radius at which cells interact with each other can lead to higher clumping of each type, ii. Increasing the radius at which cells experience limits to population growth can cause densely packed tumor clusters in space, iii. Increasing the dispersal radius of daughter cells promotes increased mixing of cell types. To our knowledge the effects of these spatial scales on eco-evolutionary dynamics have not been explored in cancer models. The fact that cancer interactions are spatially explicit and that our spatial game of mCRPC provides in general different outcomes than the non-spatial game might suggest that non-spatial models are insufficient for capturing key elements of tumorigenesis.""","""['Li You', 'Joel S Brown', 'Frank Thuijsman', 'Jessica J Cunningham', 'Robert A Gatenby', 'Jingsong Zhang', 'Kateřina Staňková']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['Optimal control to develop therapeutic strategies for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Development of a population of cancer cells: Observation and modeling by a Mixed Spatial Evolutionary Games approach.', 'Evolutionary dynamics of a smoothed war of attrition game.', 'The ideal free distribution: a review and synthesis of the game-theoretic perspective.', 'Optimizing Cancer Treatment Using Game Theory: A Review.', 'A survey of open questions in adaptive therapy: Bridging mathematics and clinical translation.', 'State-dependent evolutionary models reveal modes of solid tumour growth.', 'Abiraterone-Docetaxel scheduling for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on evolutionary dynamics.', ""Modeling cancer's ecological and evolutionary dynamics."", 'The role of evolutionary game theory in spatial and non-spatial models of the survival of cooperation in cancer: a review.']"""

The t test was used for comparing TEG parameters and routine coagulation results. Spearman rank-order correlation was used to describe the relationship of TEG and conventional tests. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values were determined for bleeding and thrombosis. Totally, 20 patients had active bleeding postoperatively, 16 of whom showed hypocoagulation on TEG test and 9 of whom showed hypocoagulation by routine coagulation test ( P = .024). Overall, 60 patients did not have active bleeding postoperatively, 51 of whom showed hypercoagulation detected by TEG test and 42 of whom showed hypercoagulation found by routine coagulation test ( P = .040). Remarkably, patients had a little higher fibrinogen (FIB) compared to controls. There was no statistical difference in any of the conventional coagulation indexes between the groups. Correlation analysis showed that reaction time (R) and coagulation time (K) were positively correlated with the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) and negatively correlated with FIB ( P < .001). Contrarily, α-angle and maximum amplitude (MA) were negatively correlated with PT-INR but positively correlated with FIB.

Objective:   To evaluate whether effects of screening on prostate cancer mortality relative to no screening differed between the ERSPC and PLCO.  Design:   Cox regression of prostate cancer death in each trial group, adjusted for age and trial. Extended analyses accounted for increased incidence due to screening and diagnostic work-up in each group via mean lead times (MLTs), which were estimated empirically and using analytic or microsimulation models.  Setting:   Randomized controlled trials in Europe and the United States.  Participants:   Men aged 55 to 69 (ERSPC) or 55 to 74 (PLCO) years at randomization.  Intervention:   Prostate cancer screening.  Measurements:   Prostate cancer incidence and survival from randomization; prostate cancer incidence in the United States before screening began.  Results:   Estimated MLTs were similar in the ERSPC and PLCO intervention groups but were longer in the PLCO control group than the ERSPC control group. Extended analyses found no evidence that effects of screening differed between trials (P = 0.37 to 0.47 [range across MLT estimation approaches]) but strong evidence that benefit increased with MLT (P = 0.0027 to 0.0032). Screening was estimated to confer a 7% to 9% reduction in the risk for prostate cancer death per year of MLT. This translated into estimates of 25% to 31% and 27% to 32% lower risk for prostate cancer death with screening as performed in the ERSPC and PLCO intervention groups, respectively, compared with no screening.  Limitation:   The MLT is a simple metric of screening and diagnostic work-up.  Conclusion:   After differences in implementation and settings are accounted for, the ERSPC and PLCO provide compatible evidence that screening reduces prostate cancer mortality.

Most relevant authorities recommend against screening, and for informed patient choice. We aimed to establish the prevalence and associations of ""non-symptomatic"" PSA-testing of men aged 40 or older by early-career general practitioners (GP registrars).  Methods:   A cross-sectional analysis from the ReCEnT cohort study of registrars' consultations, 2010-2014 (analysed in 2016). Registrars record 60 consecutive consultations each 6-month training term. The outcome factor was ordering an ""asymptomatic"" PSA test (a PSA ordered for an indication that was not prostate-related symptoms or prostatic disease monitoring). Independent variables were patient, registrar, practice, consultation and educational factors.  Results:   A total of 856 registrars contributed details of 21,372 individual consultations and 35,696 problems/diagnoses of males 40 or older. Asymptomatic PSAs were ordered for 1.8% (95%CI: 1.7-2.0%) of consultations and for 1.1% (95%CI: 1.0-1.2%) of problems/diagnoses. Multivariable associations of asymptomatic PSA testing (compared with problems/diagnoses for which a PSA was not ordered) included patient age (OR 2.32 [95%CI: 1.53-3.53] for 60-69 years compared with 40-49), patient ethnicity (OR 0.40 [95%CI: 0.19-0.86] for non-English speaking background), the patient being new to both the registrar and practice (ORs 1.46 [95%CI: 1.08-1.99] and 1.79 [95%CI: 1.03-3.10]), the number of problems/diagnoses addressed (OR 1.44 [95%CI: 1.25-1.66] for each extra problem) and more pathology tests being ordered (OR 1.88 [95%CI: 1.79-1.97] for each extra test).

The field size may impact on the patient groups which can be treated on the system. This technical note aims to address the question of which treatment sites will be affected by field size limitations on the MR-Linac.  Methods:   Using historical data for 11 595 cases over 2 yr treated at the authors' institution, the proportion of plans that would fit the MR-Linac's field size was determined for eleven patient groups. In addition, cervix plans were analyzed to determine the length of the two Clinical Target Volumes (CTVs) and any overlap between them.  Results:   With a 1 cm margin to allow for online plan adaption, 80% of all plans would be suitable for the MR-Linac due to the field size. This percentage increases to 100% for smaller tumor volumes such as prostate and brain. However, for cervix and three dose-level head and neck plans the percentage becomes 61% and 66%, respectively.  Conclusion:   The maximum radiation field size of the MR-Linac in the superior-inferior patient direction is 22 cm. With a 1 cm margin approximately 80% of all plans would be suitable for the MR-Linac with the available field size, decreasing to 61% for larger tumor volumes.

We also aimed to develop a systematic workflow for identifying and analyzing geometric and dosimetric outliers.  Methods:   Four groups (G1-G4) of pelvic plans were sampled in this study. These include the following three groups of clinical IMRT cases: G1 (37 prostate cases), G2 (37 prostate plus lymph node cases) and G3 (37 prostate bed cases). Cases in G4 were planned in accordance with dynamic-arc radiation therapy procedure and include 10 prostate cases in addition to those from G1. The workflow was separated into two parts: 1. identifying geometric outliers, assessing outlier impact, and outlier cleaning; 2. identifying dosimetric outliers, assessing outlier impact, and outlier cleaning. G2 and G3 were used to analyze the effects of geometric outliers (first experiment outlined below) while G1 and G4 were used to analyze the effects of dosimetric outliers (second experiment outlined below). A baseline model was trained by regarding all G2 cases as inliers. G3 cases were then individually added to the baseline model as geometric outliers. The impact on the model was assessed by comparing leverages of inliers (G2) and outliers (G3). A receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the optimal threshold. The experiment was repeated by training the baseline model with all G3 cases as inliers and perturbing the model with G2 cases as outliers. A separate baseline model was trained with 32 G1 cases. Each G4 case (dosimetric outlier) was subsequently added to perturb the model. Predictions of dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were made using these perturbed models for the remaining 5 G1 cases. A Weighted Sum of Absolute Residuals (WSAR) was used to evaluate the impact of the dosimetric outliers.  Results:   The leverage of inliers and outliers was significantly different. The Area-Under-Curve (AUC) for differentiating G2 (outliers) from G3 (inliers) was 0.98 (threshold: 0.27) for the bladder and 0.81 (threshold: 0.11) for the rectum. For differentiating G3 (outlier) from G2 (inlier), the AUC (threshold) was 0.86 (0.11) for the bladder and 0.71 (0.11) for the rectum. Significant increase in WSAR was observed in the model with 3 dosimetric outliers for the bladder (P < 0.005 with Bonferroni correction), and in the model with only 1 dosimetric outlier for the rectum (P < 0.005).  Conclusions:   We established a systematic workflow for identifying and analyzing geometric and dosimetric outliers, and investigated statistical metrics for outlier detection.

The identification of small molecules that can establish the sensitivity of prostate cancer (PCa) cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis is crucial for the targeted treatment of PCa. PC3, DU145, JAC-1, TsuPr1, and LNCaP cells were treated with Andrographolide (Andro) and TRAIL, and the apoptosis was measured using the Annexin V/PI double staining method. Real time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis were performed to measure the expression levels of target molecules. RNA interference technique was used to down-regulate the expression of the target protein. We established a nude mouse xenograft model of PCa, which was used to measure the caspase-3 activity in the tumor cells using flow cytometry. In this research study, our results demonstrated that Andro preferentially increased the sensitivity of PCa cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis at subtoxic concentrations, and the regulation mechanism was related to the up-regulation of DR4. In addition, it also increased the p53 expression and led to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells. Further research revealed that the DR4 inhibition, p53 expression, and ROS generation can significantly reduce the apoptosis induced by the combination of TRAIL and Andro in PCa cells. In conclusion, Andro increases the sensitivity of PCa cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the generation of ROS and up-regulation of p53 and then promotes PCa cell apoptosis associated with the activation of DR4.""","""['Ruo-Jing Wei', 'Xin-Shi Zhang', 'Da-Lin He']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Andrographolide sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via p53-mediated death receptor 4 up-regulation.', 'Ethanol promotes cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand through induction of reactive oxygen species in prostate cancer cells.', 'Ursolic acid, a pentacyclin triterpene, potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis through p53-independent up-regulation of death receptors: evidence for the role of reactive oxygen species and JNK.', 'BAY61-3606 potentiates the anti-tumor effects of TRAIL against colon cancer through up-regulating DR4 and down-regulating NF-κB.', 'Upregulation of Death Receptor 5 and Production of Reactive Oxygen Species Mediate Sensitization of PC-3 Prostate Cancer Cells to TRAIL Induced Apoptosis by Vitisin A.', 'Serum multi-cytokines screening identifies TRAIL and IL-10 as probable new biomarkers for prostate health index diagnostic utility adjustment in grey zone aggressive prostate cancer detection: A single-center data in China.', 'Biological properties of andrographolide, an active ingredient of Andrographis Paniculata: a narrative review.', 'Proteomics Analysis of Andrographolide-Induced Apoptosis via the Regulation of Tumor Suppressor p53 Proteolysis in Cervical Cancer-Derived Human Papillomavirus 16-Positive Cell Lines.', 'Enhanced anti-cancer activity of andrographis with oligomeric proanthocyanidins through activation of metabolic and ferroptosis pathways in colorectal cancer.', 'Traditional Chinese medicines and their active ingredients sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.']"""

However, there is an ongoing discussion on whether patients treated during LSE are at higher risk of complications.  Objective:   To examine LSE outcomes for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and establish patient safety and efficacy.  Design, setting, and participants:   From January 2008 to April 2016, >9000 patients underwent RARP at our institution, performed by a single surgeon. From this group, 36 patients underwent live RARP surgery (LS group) transmitted via video link from our institution to an external congress. A control group was obtained from our database to compare outcomes between the LS group and patients undergoing RARP under regular circumstances. The data were prospectively collected in a customized database and retrospectively analyzed.  Intervention:   All patients underwent RARP performed by a single surgeon at our institution.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Postoperative outcomes were compared between the LS (n=36) and the control (n=108) groups using Student's t test and analysis of variance for continuous variables, and a two-tailed Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.  Results and limitations:   There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics (age, body mass index, comorbidities, preoperative Gleason score, Sexual Health Inventory for Men score and American Urological Association symptom score) between the groups. The median console time was shorter for the LS group (73min, interquartile range [IQR] 70-79) than for the control group (78min, IQR 75-87; p=0.0371). No major complications were reported in either group, and only four minor complications were observed in the control group (p=0.2415). After median follow-up of 31 mo (IQR 18-50), only one patient (2.77%) in the LS group experienced biochemical recurrence, compared to four (3.71%) in the control group (p=0.7927). There was no significant difference in continence rates between the LS and control groups (97.22% vs 93.52%; p=0.7768). No differences in potency rate were evident by the end of the follow-up period (LS 69.44%, control group 70.37%; p=0.8432). The retrospective nature, the lack of randomization, and the single-institution experience are limitations of the study.  Conclusions:   In this series of live transmitted RARPs, perioperative results (oncological and functional outcomes and complications) were similar to those found in daily practice. After careful patient selection, LSEs are safe with minimal patient morbidity in the hands of an experienced surgeon working with a familiar surgical team. Further evaluation of the results from other surgeons at other centers is necessary.  Patient summary:   We investigated the safety of surgeries broadcast live from our institution. We found that outcomes were similar to those for patients undergoing surgery under regular circumstances in terms of the rate of complications and oncological and functional outcomes. We conclude that live transmitted surgery is safe in well-selected patients in the hands of an experienced surgeon.""","""['Gabriel Ogaya-Pinies', 'Haidar Abdul-Muhsin', 'Hariharan Palayapalayam-Ganapathi', 'Xavier Bonet', 'Travis Rogers', 'Bernardo Rocco', 'Rafael Coelho', 'Eduardo Hernandez-Cardona', 'Cathy Jenson', 'Vipul Patel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Comparing the Approach to Radical Prostatectomy Using the Multiport da Vinci Xi and da Vinci SP Robots: A Propensity Score Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes.', 'A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Outcomes of EAU-endorsed Live Surgical Events over a 5-year Period (2015-2020) and Updated Guidelines from the EAU Live Surgery Committee.', 'Evaluation of Live Surgery Meetings: Our Experience with the ""Live Makeover Aesthetic Surgery Symposium"".', 'Learning benefits of live surgery and semi-live surgery in urology-informing the debate with results from the International Meeting of Reconstructive Urology (IMORU) VIII.', 'Didactic Benefits of Surgery on Body Donors during Live Surgery Events in Minimally Invasive Surgery.', 'Live-case demonstrations in pediatric urology: Ethics, patient safety, and clinical outcomes from an 8-year institutional experience.', 'Live surgery in reconstructive urology: evaluation of the surgical outcome and educational benefit of the international meeting on reconstructive urology (IMORU).']"""

Objective:   To investigate functional outcomes for patients undergoing RP in a high-volume center.  Data, setting, and participants:   A total of 8573 consecutive RP patients (2008-2012) were analyzed.  Intervention:   RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Standardized questionnaires assessing EF, UC, and quality of life (QoL), were completed at baseline and annually thereafter. UC was defined as use of 0 or 1 safety pad/d, whereas the regular use of 1 pad/d was considered incontinent. EF was defined as ≥3 points in the International Index of Erectile Function question two. QoL was assessed using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 Global Health/QoL item. Statistics relied on comparison of means and proportions.  Results and limitations:   EF and UC rates significantly decreased after RP. Overall, 12-mo, 24-mo, and 36-mo EF rates were 45%, 51%, and 53%, but reached up to 65.7% in preoperatively potent patients with bilateral nerve sparing. At 36 mo, 13% reported problems in their partnership. However, at the same time point, 77% were satisfied with their sexual intercourse. UC rates were 89.1%, 91.3%, and 89.0% at 12-mo, 24-mo, and 36-mo postoperatively. Mean EORTC-QLQ-C30 scores ranged from 74 to 79 and remained constant compared to baseline.  Conclusions:   Although varying definitions hinder direct comparisons to other studies, functional outcomes seemed favorable for patients undergoing RP in a high-volume center and most patients reported excellent QoL.

Methods:   We included all radical prostatectomy (RP) procedures performed from January 2007 to November 2011. All of the RP specimens with PSM were reviewed to determine the GS at the level of PSM. We compared the GS at PSM with BRR.  Results:   A total of 658 RP were analysed, among which 16% had PSM.

Methods and materials:   At our institution, there were six post-TURP patients with prostate carcinoma between July 2014 and April 2016 who underwent transperineal interstitial HDR brachytherapy (16 needles). A custom modified triple-lumen catheter was placed to inject contrast into the TURP defect. Three-dimensional optimal plans using inverse planning simulated annealing algorithm was generated according to radiation therapy oncology group dose requirements. Alternative plans were retroactively generated for comparison using standard technique based on a Foley catheter as a urethral constraint volume for each patient with the same weighting factors. We compared the dosimetry parameters in each planning using Wilcoxon's ranked sum nonparametric test.  Results:   The median followup of all patients was 17.5 months. No significant genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity was noted using this technique. In the dosimetric analysis, the prostate V100 values and TURP urethral V100 were significantly different between plans with and without the contrast (V100 [mean]: 92.4 [%] vs. 94.4 [%], p = 0.046; TURP UV100 [mean]: 1.4 cc vs. 2.2 cc, p = 0.028). There were no statistical differences in the mean values of planning target volume V150%, V200%, and D90, and each bladder V75 and rectum V75.  Conclusions:   Post-TURP HDR brachytherapy with urethral contrast showed significantly more volume effect of the TURP defect than that with a Foley catheter alone. Better visualization of the TURP defect should lead to more accurate urethral sparing administration of HDR brachytherapy which is necessary to prevent urethral complication.""","""['Hiroaki Kunogi', 'Jason Adam M Cunha', 'Albert J Chang', 'Adam J Gadzinski', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'I-Chow Hsu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Acute genitourinary toxicity after high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: Second analysis to determine the correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Prostate seed implantation using 3D-computer assisted intraoperative planning vs. a standard look-up nomogram: Improved target conformality with reduction in urethral and rectal wall dose.', 'Focal high-dose-rate brachytherapy: a dosimetric comparison of hemigland vs. conventional whole-gland treatment.', 'Urinary morbidity and incontinence following transurethral resection of the prostate after brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.']"""

However, some tumors cannot be detected by MRI. What are the pathological characteristics of those tumors?  Materials and methods:   We have selected 144 consecutive patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer diagnosed on systematic and targeted biopsies (Koelis®) according to multiparametric MRI findings. On MRI, each suspicious area was graded according to the PI-RADS score v1.0. On radical prostatectomy specimen, tumor foci with a Gleason score greater than 3+3 and/or a tumor volume greater than 0,5cm3 were considered significant. The grade-four tumoral volume was calculated by multiplying the tumoral volume by grade 4 tumoral percentage.  Results:   Two hundred and seventy seven tumors were identified. A hundred and thirty nine were non-visible on MRI. They had a significantly lower volume (0.15cm3 versus 1.45cm3, P<0.0001) and a Gleason score significantly lower (P<0.0001) than apparent tumors. 17.3% of non-apparent tumors were significant. Moreover, the grade-four tumoral volume of significant non-apparent tumors was significantly lower than that of significant apparent tumors (0.11cm3 versus 0.66cm3, P<0.0001).

Materials and methods:   A total of 811 patients completed IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function) and BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) preoperatively, and 6, 12, 24 and 36 months postoperatively. Rates and predictors of depressive symptoms and impaired sexual desire were assessed with descriptive statistics and logistic regression models.  Results:   We analyzed data on 416 patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and 395 who underwent open radical prostatectomy. Overall the incidence of patients with postoperative BDI scores suggestive of depressive symptoms ranged between 26.3% at 6 months and 36.7% at 36 months. BDI scores were significantly higher in open than in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy cases at every analyzed postoperative time point (all p <0.01). Patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy showed higher IIEF-EF (Erectile Function) domain scores and a greater proportion of them experienced erectile function recovery at each time point compared to those treated with open radical prostatectomy (all p <0.005). Postoperatively the rate of impaired sexual desire ranged between 40.9% at 6 months and 34.1% at 24 months. IIEF-SD (Sexual Domain) scores were significantly lower in open radical prostatectomy cases at every followup (all p <0.02). Age, open radical prostatectomy and postoperative erectile dysfunction were independent predictors of BDI scores and impaired sexual desire.  Conclusions:   One of 3 men surgically treated for prostate cancer still report depressive symptoms months after surgery. Patients who undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy reported lower depressive symptoms than those treated with open radical prostatectomy. Sexual desire was highly affected after radical prostatectomy with greater impairment reported by patients who underwent open radical prostatectomy.""","""['Luca Boeri', 'Paolo Capogrosso', 'Eugenio Ventimiglia', 'Walter Cazzaniga', 'Filippo Pederzoli', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nadia Finocchio', 'Federico Dehò', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Emanuele Montanari', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Andrea Salonia']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus open radical retropubic prostatectomy: 24-month outcomes from a randomised controlled study.', 'Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy versus open radical retropubic prostatectomy: early outcomes from a randomised controlled phase 3 study.', 'Prevention and management of postprostatectomy sexual dysfunctions part 2: recovery and preservation of erectile function, sexual desire, and orgasmic function.', 'Robotic Surgical System for Radical Prostatectomy: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Quality of Life of Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Prostatectomy and Affective Temperament.', 'Prevalence of Cognitive Impairment before Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Efficacy and safety of single port robotic radical prostatectomy and multiport robotic radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Randomized-Controlled Trial Examining the Effect of Pelvic Floor Muscle Training in the Treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence in Men after a Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy Pilot Study.', 'Research Progress for the Clinical Application of Circulating Tumor Cells in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment.']"""

This work investigates the accuracy and precision of the multiphase BEDA relative to the BEDT in clinical cases. Ten patients with head and neck cancer and 10 patients with prostate cancer were studied using their treatment plans from Pinnacle3 9.2 (Philips Medical, Fitchburg, WI). The organs at risk (OARs) that were studied are the normal brain, left and right optic nerves, optic chiasm, spinal cord, brainstem, bladder, and rectum. BEDA and BEDT distributions were calculated using MATLAB 2010b (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and analyzed on a voxel basis for percent error, percent error volume histograms (PEVHs), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman analysis. The maximum BED values that were calculated using the BEDA and BEDT methods were also analyzed. BEDA was found to always underestimate BEDT. The accuracy and precision of BEDA distributions varied between the organs: for optic chiasm and brainstem, 50% of the patients had an overall BEDA percent error of <1%; for left and right optic nerves, rectum, and bladder, 60% to 70% of the patients had an overall BEDA percent error of <1%; and for normal brain and spinal cord, 80% of the patients had an overall BEDA percent error of <1%. BEDA distributions had maximum errors ranging from 2% to 11%, with the 11% error occurring for bladder. BEDA produced much more accurate maximum BED values with adjacent organs such as normal brain, bladder, and rectum. This study has shown that BEDA can calculate BED distributions with acceptable accuracy under certain circumstances. However, its consistency and accuracy strongly depend on the dose distributions of the different treatment phases. One should be cautious when using BEDA.""","""['Kevin I Kauweloa', 'Alonso N Gutierrez', 'Angelo M Bergamo', 'Sotirios Stathakis', 'Nikos Papanikolaou', 'Panayiotis Mavroidis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Practical aspects and uncertainty analysis of biological effective dose (BED) regarding its three-dimensional calculation in multiphase radiotherapy treatment plans.', 'Novel Radiobiological Gamma Index for Evaluation of 3-Dimensional Predicted Dose Distribution.', 'Monte Carlo evaluation of tissue heterogeneities corrections in the treatment of head and neck cancer patients using stereotactic radiotherapy.', 'Quantification of residual dose estimation error on log file-based patient dose calculation.', 'Analysis of direct clinical consequences of MLC positional errors in volumetric-modulated arc therapy using 3D dosimetry system.', 'High Biologically Effective Dose Radiotherapy for Brain Metastases May Improve Survival and Decrease Risk for Local Relapse Among Patients With Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Propensity-Matching Analysis.']"""

Patients and methods:   Through the SEER*Stat program, the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was queried for eligible records spanning the period from 2010 to 2013. The resulting group of patients was equally divided into two sets: training group (to guide model development) and validation group (to validate the model prediction). Multivariate analysis for the candidate prognostic factors (extent of extra-prostatic disease, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level and grade) was conducted through a Cox proportional model. Prostascore was then calculated for each patient. Cancer-specific and overall survival analyses according to prostascore were conducted through Kaplan-Meier analysis/Log-rank testing.  Results:   In total, 8727 patients with treatment-naive advanced prostate cancer and complete baseline data were identified in the period from 2010 to 2013. The following factors were associated with better cancer-specific survival in the training set (isolated regional nodal disease, lower PSA level and lower grade group; P < 0.0001). After assignment of a prostascore for each patient, cancer-specific survival was compared according to the score. Pairwise comparisons between all different scores were conducted. For cancer-specific survival evaluation according to the prostascore model, P values for pairwise comparisons among different score points were significant (P < 0.05) in the validation set.

Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and NKX3.1 have emerged as promising IHC markers to determine prostatic origin of metPA in surgical specimens. Our goal is to evaluate the performance of PSMA and NKX3.1 and compare them with those of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate specific alkaline phosphatase (PSAP) in the cytological diagnosis of metPA MATERIALS: Cytology specimens from patients with a history of prostate adenocarcinoma at our institution between January 01, 2005 and December 31, 2015 were retrieved. IHC stains were performed on the cell blocks. In addition to the staining pattern and intensity, the sensitivity, and specificity of PSMA and NKX3.1 were assessed and compared to those of PSA and PSAP markers.  Results:   A total of 56 cytology cases were retrieved with the following diagnoses: 13 metPA, 37 metastatic carcinomas from other origins, 4 rare atypical cells, and 2 benign. Additional 9 cases were re-classified as metPA based on positive PSMA and/or NKX3.1 immunostains. In our cohort of 22 cases of metPA, 18 were positive for PSMA (82%), 15 for NKX3.1 (68%), 9 for PSA (41%), and 9 for PSAP (41%). PSMA and NKX3.1 were negative in all 6 cases of metastatic carcinoma of nonprostate origin (specificity 100%). PSMA demonstrated strong membranous staining pattern, and NKX3.1 exhibited moderate nuclear staining pattern.

While expression of TERT has been considered the key rate-limiting component for telomerase activity, increasing evidence suggests an important role for the regulation of TERC in telomere maintenance and perhaps other functions in human cancer. By using three orthogonal methods including RNAseq, RT-qPCR, and an analytically validated chromogenic RNA in situ hybridization assay, we report consistent overexpression of TERC in prostate cancer. This overexpression occurs at the precursor stage (e.g. high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or PIN) and persists throughout all stages of disease progression. Levels of TERC correlate with levels of MYC (a known driver of prostate cancer) in clinical samples and we also show the following: forced reductions of MYC result in decreased TERC levels in eight cancer cell lines (prostate, lung, breast, and colorectal); forced overexpression of MYC in PCa cell lines, and in the mouse prostate, results in increased TERC levels; human TERC promoter activity is decreased after MYC silencing; and MYC occupies the TERC locus as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Finally, we show that knockdown of TERC by siRNA results in reduced proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines. These studies indicate that TERC is consistently overexpressed in all stages of prostatic adenocarcinoma and that its expression is regulated by MYC. These findings nominate TERC as a novel prostate cancer biomarker and therapeutic target. Copyright © 2017 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Methods: We prospectively evaluated 50 PCa patients with biochemical relapse after surgery or external-beam radiation therapy. All patients underwent 64CuCl2 PET/CT, 18F-choline PET/CT, and multiparametric MRI within 15 d of each other. Experienced readers interpreted the images, and the detection rate (DR) of each imaging modality was calculated. Histopathology, when available; clinical or laboratory response; and multidisciplinary follow-up were used to confirm the site of disease. In parallel, biodistribution, kinetics of the lesions, and radiation dosimetry of 64CuCl2 were evaluated. Results: From a dosimetric point of view, an administered dose of 200 MBq for 64CuCl2 translated into a 5.7-mSv effective dose. Unlike 18F-choline, 64CuCl2 was not excreted or accumulated in the urinary tract, thus allowing thorough pelvic exploration. The maximum 64CuCl2 uptake at the sites of PCa relapse was observed 1 h after tracer injection. In our cohort, 64CuCl2 PET/CT proved positive in 41 of 50 patients, with an overall DR of 82%. The DRs of 18F-choline PET/CT and multiparametric MRI were 56% and 74%, respectively. The difference between the DRs of 64CuCl2 PET/CT and 18F-choline PET/CT was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Interestingly, on considering prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value, 64CuCl2 PET/CT had a higher DR than 18F-choline PET/CT in patients with a PSA of less than 1 ng/mL. Conclusion: The biodistribution of 64CuCl2 is more suitable than that of 18F-choline for exploring the pelvis and prostatic bed.

The structural analysis of this PTM is challenging because of the diverse monosaccharides which are not conserved among organisms, the branched nature of glycans, their isomeric structures, and heterogeneity in the glycan distribution at a given site. Glycoproteomics experiments have adopted the traditional high-throughput LC-MSn proteomics workflow to analyze site-specific glycosylation. However, comprehensive computational platforms for data analyses are scarce. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive, open-source, modular software for glycoproteomics data analysis called GlycoPAT (GlycoProteomics Analysis Toolbox; freely available from www.VirtualGlycome.org/glycopat). The program includes three major advances: (1) ""SmallGlyPep,"" a minimal linear representation of glycopeptides for MSn data analysis. This format allows facile serial fragmentation of both the peptide backbone and PTM at one or more locations. (2) A novel scoring scheme based on calculation of the ""Ensemble Score (ES),"" a measure that scores and rank-orders MS/MS spectrum for N- and O-linked glycopeptides using cross-correlation and probability based analyses. (3) A false discovery rate (FDR) calculation scheme where decoy glycopeptides are created by simultaneously scrambling the amino acid sequence and by introducing artificial monosaccharides by perturbing the original sugar mass. Parallel computing facilities and user-friendly GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces) are also provided. GlycoPAT is used to catalogue site-specific glycosylation on simple glycoproteins, standard protein mixtures and human plasma cryoprecipitate samples in three common MS/MS fragmentation modes: CID, HCD and ETD. It is also used to identify 960 unique glycopeptides in cell lysates from prostate cancer cells. The results show that the simultaneous consideration of peptide and glycan fragmentation is necessary for high quality MSn spectrum annotation in CID and HCD fragmentation modes.

This fusion results in expression of full-length or N-terminally truncated ERG protein in prostate epithelia. ERG is not expressed in normal prostate epithelia, but when expressed, it promotes tumorigenesis via altered gene expression, stimulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cellular migration/invasion, and transformation. However, limited knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of ERG function in prostate cells has hampered efforts to therapeutically target ERG. ERK-mediated phosphorylation of ERG is required for ERG functions in prostate cells, but the reason for this requirement is unknown. Here, we report a mechanism whereby ERK-mediated phosphorylation of ERG at one serine residue causes a conformational change that allows ERK phosphorylation at a second serine residue, Ser-96. We found that the Ser-96 phosphorylation resulted in dissociation of EZH2 and SUZ12, components of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), transcriptional activation of ERG target genes, and increased cell migration. Conversely, loss of ERG phosphorylation at Ser-96 resulted in recruitment of EZH2 across the ERG-cistrome and a genome-wide loss of ERG-mediated transcriptional activation and cell migration. In conclusion, our findings have identified critical molecular mechanisms involving ERK-mediated ERG activation that could be exploited for therapeutic intervention in ERG-positive prostate cancers.""","""['Vivekananda Kedage', 'Brady G Strittmatter', 'Paige B Dausinas', 'Peter C Hollenhorst']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling differentially regulate oncogenic ERG mediated transcription in prostate cells.', 'Binding of TMPRSS2-ERG to BAF Chromatin Remodeling Complexes Mediates Prostate Oncogenesis.', 'Comparison of MAPK specificity across the ETS transcription factor family identifies a high-affinity ERK interaction required for ERG function in prostate cells.', 'Mutations and deletions of PRC2 in prostate cancer.', 'Oncogenic ETS Factors in Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of MEF2C in the Endothelial Cells Derived from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.', 'SNF1-related protein kinase 1 represses Arabidopsis growth through post-translational modification of E2Fa in response to energy stress.', 'From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer.', 'Past, Current, and Future Strategies to Target ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling differentially regulate oncogenic ERG mediated transcription in prostate cells.']"""

The aim of this study is to evaluate psychological distress in uro-oncological patients undergoing different surgeries: radical cystectomy, radical prostatectomy, radical nephrectomy, or transurethral resection (TUR) before the surgery.  Materials and methods:   We performed a cross-sectional study in consecutively enrolled patients with bladder, kidney, or prostate cancer, scheduled for surgery. Demographic data, socioeconomic status, education level, and diagnoses were recorded. Patients with a previous diagnosis of depression or anxiety were excluded. We evaluated the level of clinically meaningful depression and anxiety assessed by 2 tools: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; score ≥8 presence of anxiety and depression; score ≥11 clinical anxiety and depression) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). To determine variables related to depression and anxiety among the demographic variables, logistic regression analyses were conducted, with P<0.05 considered as statistically significant.  Results:   A total of 207 patients were recruited, completed the questionnaires and were included in the study. Patients presented a mean age of 70.8 (±10.8) years, 89% were males (n = 184) and 19% of patients presented previous cancer. The majority of patients underwent surgery for bladder tumors (60.4%) and the most common type of surgery was TUR. The most frequent procedures were performed for bladder tumors (60.4%), being TUR the most common type of surgery (52.7%) followed by radical prostatectomy (24.6%). Mean STAI-State score was 19.3 (±10.3), and mean STAI-Trait score was 18.4 (±11.9) points. Clinical levels of anxiety and depression (HADS ≥ 11 points) were found in 19 (9.8%) and 7 (3.6%) cases. And HADS anxiety 8 to 10 points was present in 14.5% (n = 28) and HADS depression 8 to 10 points in 5.7% (n = 11) of the sample, representing presence of psychological distress. Female patients showed a higher level of anxiety and STAI-Trait compared to males.  Conclusion:   The present results show that our patients had lower levels of anxiety and depression than those described in the literature.

The expression levels of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in human prostate cancer tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. After treated with carnosol (0.25-16 μmol/L), the cell survival of LNCaP and DU145 cells were detected by MTT assay. The expression levels of Gli1 and Shh mRNA and protein in the two cells were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The apoptosis was determined by the caspase-3 activity assay. Results showed that Shh and Gli1 were upregulated in cancer tissues. The inhibitory effect of carnosol on cell survival was enhanced with concentration, suggesting both LNCaP and DU145 cells were sensitive to carnosol. The inhibitory effects of carnosol on Gli1 and Shh mRNAs in the hormone-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell was stronger than that in the hormone-independent DU145 prostate cancer cells. Carnosol downregulated the expression of Gli1 in nucleus, and Shh in cells. Greater carnosol concentration resulted in lower levels of Gli1 and Shh. Carnosol increased caspase-3 activity in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that carnosol promotes cell apoptosis. Thus, carnosol can inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and its mechanism might be associated with the inhibiting of HH signaling pathway. Although the inhibitory effect of carnosol on hormone-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells is stronger than hormone-independent DU145 prostate cancer cells, carnosol might be a potential drug for hormone-independent prostate cancer.""","""['H Gao', 'Q Song', 'J Yang', 'S Yu', 'J Zhao', 'G Yu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)""","""['β2 -adrenergic receptor signaling drives prostate cancer progression by targeting the Sonic hedgehog-Gli1 signaling activation.', 'Perlecan, a candidate gene for the CAPB locus, regulates prostate cancer cell growth via the Sonic Hedgehog pathway.', 'SHh-Gli1 signaling pathway promotes cell survival by mediating baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 3 (BIRC3) gene in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Prognostic Role of Hedgehog-GLI1 Signaling Pathway in Aggressive and Metastatic Breast Cancers.', 'Regulation of Cell Signaling Pathways and miRNAs by Resveratrol in Different Cancers.', 'Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Carnosic Acid and Carnosol in Standardized Rosemary Extract and the Effect on the Disease Activity Index of DSS-Induced Colitis.', 'Anticancer Properties of Carnosol: A Summary of in Vitro and In Vivo Evidence.', 'Mechanism of protective effect of carnosol on pig intestinal epithelial cells.']"""

This suggests that reconstitution of Wnt5a in low WNT5A-expressing tumors might be an attractive therapeutic approach. To explore this idea, we have in the present study used Foxy-5, a WNT5A mimicking peptide, to investigate its impact on primary tumor and metastasis in vivo and on prostate cancer cell viability, apoptosis and invasion in vitro. We used an in vivo orthotopic xenograft mouse model with metastatic luciferase-labeled WNT5A-low DU145 cells and metastatic luciferase-labeled WNT5A-high PC3prostate cancer cells. We provide here the first evidence that Foxy-5 significantly inhibits the initial metastatic dissemination of tumor cells to regional and distal lymph nodes by 90% and 75%, respectively. Importantly, this effect was seen only with the WNT5A-low DU145 cells and not with the WNT5A-high PC3 cells. The inhibiting effect in the DU145-based model occurred despite the fact that no effects were observed on primary tumor growth, apoptosis or proliferation. These findings are consistent with and supported by the in vitro data, where Foxy-5 specifically targets invasion without affecting apoptosis or viability of WNT5A-low prostate cancer cells. To conclude, our data indicate that the WNT5A-mimicking peptide Foxy-5, which has been recently used in a phase 1 clinical trial, is an attractive candidate for complimentary anti-metastatic treatment of prostate cancer patients with tumors exhibiting absent or low WNT5A expression.""","""['Giacomo Canesin', 'Susan Evans-Axelsson', 'Rebecka Hellsten', 'Agnieszka Krzyzanowska', 'Chandra P Prasad', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Tommy Andersson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Prostate cancer: Foxy-5 in prostate cancer model.', 'The STAT3 Inhibitor Galiellalactone Effectively Reduces Tumor Growth and Metastatic Spread in an Orthotopic Xenograft Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulation of prostate cancer cell migration toward bone marrow stromal cell-conditioned medium by Wnt5a signaling.', 'The Wnt-5a-derived hexapeptide Foxy-5 inhibits breast cancer metastasis in vivo by targeting cell motility.', 'WNT5A as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.', 'The WNT-5a derived peptide, Foxy-5, possesses dual properties that impair progression of ERalpha negative breast cancer.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'Anti-Cancer Stem-Cell-Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Recent advances in prostate cancer: WNT signaling, chromatin regulation, and transcriptional coregulators.', 'WNT5a Signaling through ROR2 Activates the Hippo Pathway to Suppress YAP1 Activity and Tumor Growth.', 'Signaling Pathways and Targeted Therapies for Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.']"""

While differential expression of miRNAs is widely observed in cancers including prostate cancer (PCa), how these miRNAs are transcriptionally regulated is largely unknown. MiRNA-221 and miRNA-222 (miR-221/-222) are well-established oncogenes and overexpressed in breast, liver, pancreas, and lung cancer, but their expression and biological functions in PCa remain controversial. Both up and down regulation have been observed in patient samples. Specifically, studies have demonstrated miR-221/-222 function as oncogenes, and promote PCa cell proliferation and the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the expression level of miR-221/-222 is downregulated in several miRNA expression profiling studies. In this study, we demonstrate miR-221/-222 are androgen receptor (AR)-repressed genes and reside in a long primary transcript (pri-miRNA). Derepression of miR-221/-222 after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may enhance PCa cell proliferation potential through promoting G1/S phase transition. This function is likely transient but important in the development of CRPC. Downregulation of miR-221/-222 subsequently occurs once AR activity is restored through AR overexpression in CRPC. Our findings shed light on the complexity of transcriptional regulation of miRNAs in PCa and suggest context-dependent targeting of oncogenic miRNAs.""","""['Bin Gui', 'Chen-Lin Hsieh', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Li Jia']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Androgen receptor-regulated miRNA-193a-3p targets AJUBA to promote prostate cancer cell migration.', 'c-MYC drives histone demethylase PHF8 during neuroendocrine differentiation and in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'MicroRNA Regulation of Androgen Receptor in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Premises, Promises, and Potentials.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'In Prostate Cancer Cells Cytokines Are Early Responders to Gravitational Changes Occurring in Parabolic Flights.', 'The sex-dependent role of the androgen receptor in glioblastoma: results of molecular analyses.', 'miR-221/222 as biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention on cancer and other diseases: A systematic review.', 'Interaction between Non-Coding RNAs and Androgen Receptor with an Especial Focus on Prostate Cancer.']"""

In the current study, it was hypothesized that the effect of PCAT-1 on the aggressiveness of CRC cells was dependent on the function of c-Myc. Human CRC cell lines Caco-2 and HT-29 were transfected with specific PCAT-1 shRNAs, and cell migration, invasiveness, and resistance to 5-fluorouracil were measured. To elucidate the role of c-Myc in PCAT-1 function, c-Myc was overexpressed in PCAT-1-silenced CRC cells and the effect of c-Myc overexpression on the aggressiveness of PCAT-1-silenced cells was detected. The results showed that knockdown of PCAT-1 in CRC cells suppressed cell motility and invasiveness, and sensitized the cells to 5-fluorouracil, as evidenced by the reduced viability and induced apoptosis in PCAT-1-silenced cells compared to the parental cells in response to 5-fluorouracil treatment. The expression of c-Myc in PCAT-1-silenced CRC cells was down-regulated, and forced expression of c-Myc partially restored the invasiveness in PCAT-1-silenced cells. In summary, the findings outlined in the current study suggest that PCAT-1 regulates the invasiveness and drug resistance in CRC cells and that PCAT-1 may promote CRC cell invasion by modulating the expression of c-Myc.""","""['Lei Qiao', 'Xiangyu Liu', 'Yichao Tang', 'Zheng Zhao', 'Jilong Zhang', 'Huayan Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['Down regulation of the long non-coding RNA PCAT-1 induced growth arrest and apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells.', 'LncRNA PCAT-1 regulated cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis in colorectal cancer through targeting miR-149-5p.', 'SNHG15 is a bifunctional MYC-regulated noncoding locus encoding a lncRNA that promotes cell proliferation, invasion and drug resistance in colorectal cancer by interacting with AIF.', 'PCAT-1: A Novel Oncogenic Long Non-Coding RNA in Human Cancers.', 'MicroRNAs and Apoptosis in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Progress in the studies on the molecular mechanisms associated with multidrug resistance in cancers.', 'Role of Non-Coding RNAs in Colorectal Cancer: Focus on Long Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Comprehensive landscape and future perspectives of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in colorectal cancer (CRC): Based on a bibliometric analysis.', 'N7-methylguanosine-related lncRNAs: Distinction between hot and cold tumors and construction of predictive models in colon adenocarcinoma.', 'Significant position of C-myc in colorectal cancer: a promising therapeutic target.']"""

We studied the role of testosterone as a prognostic marker for advanced prostate cancer (stage C or higher) treated with primary androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).  Patients and methods:   A total of 348 patients were treated using ADT as first-line therapy for prostate cancer at Chiba University Hospital between 1999 and 2016. Of these, 222 patients with advanced prostate cancer (stage C or higher) were enrolled onto this study. The prognostic values of serum testosterone level and other clinical factors were evaluated in association with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), progression-free survival during first-line therapy, and overall survival.  Results:   Median age was 73 years. PSA at baseline was 86 ng/mL. Gleason scores of ≤ 6, 7, 8, and ≥ 9 were seen in 2.3%, 19.4%, 21.2%, and 41.9%, respectively. Mean follow-up was 60.5 months. Median testosterone at baseline was 482 ng/dL and nadir testosterone was 13 ng/dL. No variable associated with testosterone predicted progression-free survival. With regard to overall survival, multivariate analysis identified nadir testosterone ≤ 20 ng/dL (hazard ratio = 0.44, P = .026) and testosterone reduction ≥ 480 ng/dL (hazard ratio = 0.35, P = .030) as independent prognostic factors. With regard to progression-free survival, multivariate analysis identified nadir PSA ≤ 0.1 ng/mL (hazard ratio = 3.07, P < .001), presence of lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio = 1.67, P = .017), and time to nadir PSA (hazard ratio = 0.30, P < .001) as independent prognostic factors.

Objective:   To report erectile function and early oncologic outcomes for both surgical modalities, stratified by prostate cancer risk grouping.  Design, setting, and participants:   In a prospective nonrandomised trial, we recruited 2545 men with prostate cancer from seven open (n=753) and seven robot-assisted (n=1792) Swedish centres (2008-2011).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Clinometrically-validated questionnaire-based patient-reported erectile function was collected before, 3 mo, 12 mo, and 24 mo after surgery. Surgeon-reported degree of neurovascular-bundle preservation, pathologist-reported positive surgical margin (PSM) rates, and 2-yr prostate-specific antigen-relapse rates were measured.  Results and limitations:   Among 1702 preoperatively potent men, we found enhanced erectile function recovery for low/intermediate-risk patients in the robot-assisted group at 3 mo. For patients with high-risk tumours, point estimates for erectile function recovery at 24 mo favoured the open surgery group. The degree of neurovascular bundle preservation and erectile function recovery were greater correlated for robot-assisted surgery. In pT2 tumours, 10% versus 17% PSM rates were observed for open and robot-assisted surgery, respectively; corresponding rates for pT3 tumours were 48% and 33%. These differences were associated with biochemical recurrence in pT3 but not pT2 disease. The study is limited by its nonrandomised design and relatively short follow-up.  Conclusions:   Earlier recovery of erectile function in the robot-assisted surgery group in lower-risk patients is counterbalanced by lower PSM rates for open surgeons in organ-confined disease; thus, both open and robotic surgeons need to consider this trade-off when determining the plane of surgical dissection. Robot-assisted surgery also facilitates easier identification of nerve preservation planes during radical prostatectomy as well as wider dissection for pT3 cases.  Patient summary:   For prostate cancer surgery, an open operation reduces erection problems in high-risk cancers but has higher relapse rates than robotic surgery. Relapse rates appear similar in low/intermediate-risk cancers and the robot appears better at preserving erections in these cases.""","""['Prasanna Sooriakumaran', 'Giovannalberto Pini', 'Tommy Nyberg', 'Maryam Derogar', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Johan Stranne', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Jonas Hugosson', 'Gunnar Steineck', 'Peter N Wiklund']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Editorial on ""Erectile function and oncologic outcomes following open retropubic and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results from the LAParoscopic Prostatectomy Robot Open Trial"".', 'Robotic-assisted vs. open radical prostatectomy: an update to the never-ending debate.', 'Urinary Incontinence and Erectile Dysfunction After Robotic Versus Open Radical Prostatectomy: A Prospective, Controlled, Nonrandomised Trial.', 'Functional and Oncologic Outcomes Between Open and Robotic Radical Prostatectomy at 24-month Follow-up in the Swedish LAPPRO Trial.', 'Functional and Oncological Outcomes After Open Versus Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy for Localised Prostate Cancer: 8-Year Follow-up.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Retzius Sparing Radical Prostatectomy Versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Which Technique Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients (MASTER Study)?

MPPA and MPP organoids expressed the clinical prostate cancer marker AMACR and developed prostate adenocarcinoma when grafted under the renal capsule in mice.

Forty overweight/obese men with clinically confirmed prostate cancer were randomised to the WLI presurgery or to a control arm; changes in weight, body composition, quality-of-life, circulating biomarkers, gene expression, and immunohistochemical markers in tumour and benign prostatic tissue were evaluated.  Results:   The study period averaged 50 days. Mean (s.d.) change scores for the WLI vs control arms were as follows: weight: -4.7 (3.1) kg vs -2.2 (4.4) kg (P=0.0508); caloric intake: -500 (636) vs -159 (600) kcal per day (P=0.0034); PA: +0.9 (3.1) vs +1.7 (4.6) MET-hours per day (NS); vitality: +5.3 (7.l4) vs -1.8 (8.1) (P=0.0491); testosterone: +55.1 (86.0) vs -48.3 (203.7) ng dl-1 (P=0.0418); sex hormone-binding globulin: +14.0 (14.6) vs +1.8 (7.6) nmol l-1 (P=0.0023); and leptin: -2.16 (2.6) vs -0.03 (3.75) (P=0.0355). Follow-up Ki67 was significantly higher in WLI vs control arms; median (interquartile range): 5.0 (2.5,10.0) vs 0.0 (0.0,2.5) (P=0.0061) and several genes were upregulated, for example, CTSL, GSK3B, MED12, and LAMC2.  Conclusions:   Intentional weight loss shows mixed effects on circulating biomarkers, tumour gene expression, and proliferative markers. More study is needed before recommending weight loss, in particular rapid weight loss, among men with prostate cancer.""","""['Wendy Demark-Wahnefried', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami', 'Renee A Desmond', 'Jennifer B Gordetsky', 'Gary R Hunter', 'Eddy S Yang', 'Maria Azrad', 'Andrew D Frugé', 'Yuko Tsuruta', 'Lyse A Norian', 'Roanne Segal', 'William E Grizzle']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Feasibility outcomes of a presurgical randomized controlled trial exploring the impact of caloric restriction and increased physical activity versus a wait-list control on tumor characteristics and circulating biomarkers in men electing prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Randomized trial of weight loss in primary breast cancer: Impact on body composition, circulating biomarkers and tumor characteristics.', 'Phase II prospective randomized trial of weight loss prior to radical prostatectomy.', 'Consensus Statement on Circulating Biomarkers for Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: Tumour genomes are highly plastic.', 'The effect of preoperative behaviour change interventions on pre- and post-surgery health behaviours, health outcomes, and health inequalities in adults: A systematic review and meta-analyses.', 'The influence of lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and stress reduction) on prostate cancer tumour biology and patient outcomes: A systematic review.', 'The Pathways to Prevention program: nutrition as prevention for improved cancer outcomes.', 'Effect of 24\xa0mg dexamethasone preoperatively on surgical stress, pain and recovery in robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy.', 'Body mass index and survival after cancer diagnosis: A pan-cancer cohort study of 114 430 patients with cancer.']"""

Here we report a novel ""oncogenic"" role of XPO5 in advanced prostate cancer. Using prostate cancer models, we found that excess levels of XPO5 override the inhibitory effect of the canoncial miRNA-mRNA regulation, resulting in a global increase in proteins expression. Importantly, we found that decreased expression of XPO5 could promote an increase in proteasome degradation, whereas overexpression of XPO5 leads to altered protein posttranslational modification via hyperglycosylation, resulting in cellular protein stability. We evaluated the therapeutic advantage of targeting XPO5 in prostate cancer and found that knocking down XPO5 in prostate cancer cells suppressed cellular proliferation and tumor development without significantly impacting normal fibroblast cells survival. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the oncogenic role of XPO5 in overriding the miRNAs regulation control.

Although AKR1C3 is a promising drug target, no AKR1C3-targeted agent has to date been approved for clinical use. Flufenamic acid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is known to potently inhibit AKR1C3 in a non-selective manner as COX off-target effects are also observed. To diminish off-target effects, we have applied a scaffold hopping strategy replacing the benzoic acid moiety of flufenamic acid with an acidic hydroxyazolecarbonylic scaffold. In particular, differently N-substituted hydroxylated triazoles were designed to simultaneously interact with both subpockets 1 and 2 in the active site of AKR1C3, larger for AKR1C3 than other AKR1Cs isoforms. Through computational design and iterative rounds of synthesis and biological evaluation, novel compounds are reported, sharing high selectivity (up to 230-fold) for AKR1C3 over 1C2 isoform and minimal COX1 and COX2 off-target inhibition. A docking study of compound 8, the most interesting compound of the series, suggested that its methoxybenzyl substitution has the ability to fit inside subpocket 2, being involved in π-π staking interaction with Trp227 (partial overlapping) and in a T-shape π-π staking with Trp86.

Participants:   252 men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who had received a DA, 45 treating physicians at 4 US Veterans Administration urology clinics.  Methods:   Qualitative analysis of transcribed audio recordings was used to inductively develop categories capturing content and function of all direct references to DAs (booklet talk). The presence or absence of any booklet talk per transcript was also calculated.  Results:   Booklet talk occurred in 55% of transcripts. Content focused on surgical procedures (36%); treatment choice (22%); and clarifying risk classification (17%). The most common function of booklet talk was patient corroboration of physicians' explanations (42%), followed by either physician or patient acknowledgement that the patient had the booklet. Codes reflected the absence of DA use for shared decision-making. In regression analysis, predictors of booklet talk were fewer years of patient education (P = .027) and more time in the encounter (P = .027). Patient race, DA type, time reading the DA, physician informing quality and physician age did not predict booklet talk.

Methods and results:   A custom-made double-bladed knife was utilised for cutting a 4-mm-thick horizontal section of the prostate. The slices were split into segments that were frozen in gel, cryosections were cut, and RNA integrity numbers (RINs) were analysed. Sections were cut from all blocks of 20 cases, and the cutting time was monitored. Slides were scanned, and the slices were digitally reconstructed. Cutting frozen sections of an entire slice took 79-253 min (mean 162 min). Tumour was detected in frozen sections of 85% (17/20) of cases and in 46% (72/155) of blocks. The morphological quality was determined to be excellent, and RIN values were high (mean 8.9).

However, how STK4 restricts the emergence of aggressive cancer remains elusive. Here, we investigated the effects of STK4, primarily localized in the cytoplasm, lipid raft, and nucleus, on cell growth and gene expression in aggressive prostate cancer. We demonstrated that lipid raft and nuclear STK4 had superior suppressive effects on cell growth in vitro and in vivo compared with cytoplasmic STK4. Using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, we identified several differentially expressed (DE) genes that responded to ectopic STK4 in all three subcellular compartments. We noted that the number of DE genes observed in lipid raft and nuclear STK4 cells were much greater than cytoplasmic STK4. Our functional annotation clustering showed that these DE genes were commonly associated with oncogenic pathways such as AR, PI3K/AKT, BMP/SMAD, GPCR, WNT, and RAS as well as unique pathways such as JAK/STAT, which emerged only in nuclear STK4 cells. These findings indicate that MST1/STK4/Hippo signaling restricts aggressive tumor cell growth by intersecting with multiple molecular pathways, suggesting that targeting of the STK4/Hippo pathway may have important therapeutic implications for cancer.""","""['Damien Ready', 'Kader Yagiz', 'Pooneh Amin', 'Yuksel Yildiz', 'Vincent Funari', 'Serdar Bozdag', 'Bekir Cinar']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The Hippo pathway: an emerging role in urologic cancers.', 'Threonine-120 phosphorylation regulated by phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin pathway signaling limits the antitumor activity of mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1.', 'MicroRNA-18a targeting of the STK4/MST1 tumour suppressor is necessary for transformation in HPV positive cervical cancer.', 'Androgen attenuates the inactivating phospho-Ser-127 modification of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and promotes YAP1 nuclear abundance and activity.', 'The Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of DNA methylation in ovarian cancer chemoresistance: A narrative review.', 'The Hippo effector YAP1/TEAD1 regulates EPHA3 expression to control cell contact and motility.', 'MicroRNA miR-23b-3p promotes osteosarcoma by targeting ventricular zone expressed PH domain-containing 1 (VEPH1)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway.', 'The Hippo pathway: an emerging role in urologic cancers.', ""The Beneficial Role of Exercise on Treating Alzheimer's Disease by Inhibiting β-Amyloid Peptide.""]"""

Reduced CD169 expression in pre-metastatic regional LNs is associated with subsequent metastatic disease and a poor outcome in several tumor types, but if this is the case in prostate cancer has not been explored.  Methods:   CD169 expression was measured with immunohistochemistry in metastasis-free regional LNs from 109 prostate cancer patients treated with prostatectomy (January 1996 to April 2002). Possible associations of CD169 expression with PSA-relapse, prostate cancer death, Gleason score, and other clinical data were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival- and Cox regression analysis. In addition, the Dunning rat prostate tumor model was used to examine CD169 expression in pre-metastatic LNs draining either highly metastatic MatLyLu- or poorly metastatic AT1-tumors.  Results:   In patients with low CD169 immunostaining in metastasis-free regional LNs, 8 of the 27 patients died from prostate cancer compared with only three of the 82 patients with high immunostaining (P < 0.001). CD169 expression in regional LNs was not associated with PSA-relapse. Rats with highly metastatic tumors had decreased CD169 immunoreactivity in pre-metastatic regional LNs compared with rats with poorly metastatic tumors.

The ways in which EVs interact with recipient cells to influence cell physiology and deliver a macromolecular payload are at the early stages of exploration. A significant challenge within these studies is the ability to label EVs directly or indirectly with fluorescent probes to allow visualization without compromising functionality. Here, we present a thiol-based fluorescence labelling method allowing comprehensive analysis of the cellular uptake of prostate cancer derived EVs in live cells using confocal microscopy. Labelling of the EVs in this way did not influence their size and had no effect on their ability to induce differentiation of lung fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. For endocytosis analyses, depletion of key endocytic proteins and the use of chemical inhibitors (Dynasore, EIPA, Rottlerin and IPA-3) indicated that fluid-phase endocytosis and/or macropinocytosis was involved in EV internalisation. Over a period of six hours EVs were observed to increasingly co-localise with lysosomes, indicating a possible termination point following internalisation.

Multivariate analysis was performed to identify clinical prognostic factors for FFBR and late toxicities. The median follow-up period was 70 months (range, 4-145 months).

We included 1757 men who did not report a history of prostate cancer at baseline. We assessed shift- and night-work exposure up to time of the baseline interview. Incident prostate cancers were recorded from baseline through September 2014. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) of shift- and night-work exposure using Cox proportional hazards regression with age at event as timescale, adjusting for smoking status, family history of prostate cancer, education (≤13, 14-17, ≥18 years), and equivalent income (low, medium, high). Results We observed a twofold increased HR for prostate cancer among shift and night workers. Ever employment in shift work was associated with HR 2.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-3.67 and night work with HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.42-3.64.

This study projects cancer trends in the elderly population in Lebanon, a country experiencing accelerating aging trends. Findings will guide future policy decisions regarding geriatric oncology in Lebanon and the surrounding Arab world.  Materials and methods:   Cancer incidence rates were derived for men and women 65years and above, divided into three age groups: 65-69years, 70-74years, and 75years and above. Raw data were obtained from the National Cancer Registry reports 2003-2010. The eight consecutive year data were used to project the incidence until 2025 using a logarithmic model. The Average Annual Percent Change in incidence rates was calculated to determine whether it would significantly increase, decrease, or remain stable over time.  Results:   Incidence rates are projected to increase significantly in all age groups of both genders until 2025. In men, the fastest rise is expected in prostate cancer, followed by bladder, lung, colorectal, and NHL. In women, the rise will be fastest in breast, followed by colorectal, lung, NHL, and ovary. Projected rates increase faster in the ""younger"" age group 65-69 compared to the ""oldest"" ≥75, both in men and women. Only kidney and liver cancers continue to rise significantly after 75.

The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is increasingly recognized as being potentially important for the development and progression of PCa. In this retrospective study, we compared the activation status of the Hh signaling pathway between benign and tumor tissue, and evaluated the clinical significance of Hh signaling in PCa.  Methods:   In this tissue microarray (TMA) study, the protein expression of several Hh signaling components and Hh target proteins, along with microvessel density, were compared between benign (n = 64) and malignant (n = 170) prostate tissue, and correlated with PCa clinicopathological characteristics and biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   The Hh signaling pathway appeared to be more active in PCa than in benign prostate tissue, as demonstrated by lower expression of the negative regulators PTCH1 and GLI3 in the tumor tissue compared to benign. In addition, high epithelial GLI2 expression correlated with higher pathological Gleason score. Overall, higher epithelial GLI3 expression in the tumor was shown to be an independent marker of a favorable prognosis.  Conclusion:   Hh signaling activation might reflect aggressive tumoral behavior, since high epithelial GLI2 expression positively correlates with a higher pathological Gleason score.

Our previous in vitro study indicated that physiological normal levels of androgens inhibited the proliferation of PCa cells. In this in vivo study, the ability of testosterone (T) to inhibit PCa growth was assessed by testing the tumor incidence rate and tumor growth rate of PCa xenografts on nude mice.  Methods:   Different serum testosterone levels were manipulated in male nude/nude athymic mice by orchiectomy or inserting different dosages of T pellets subcutaneously. PCa cells were injected subcutaneously to nude mice and tumor incidence rate and tumor growth rate of PCa xenografts were tested.  Results:   The data demonstrated that low levels of serum T resulted in the highest PCa incidence rate (50%). This PCa incidence rate in mice with low T levels was significantly higher than that in mice treated with higher doses of T (24%, P < 0.01) and mice that underwent orchiectomy (8%, P < 0.001). Mice that had low serum T levels had the shortest tumor volume doubling time (112 h). This doubling time was significantly shorter than that in the high dose 5 mg T arm (158 h, P < 0.001) and in the orchiectomy arm (468 h, P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   These results indicated that low T levels are optimal for PCa cell growth. Castrate T levels, as seen after orchiectomy, are not sufficient to support PCa cell growth.

Previously, we observed that prostate cancer cells uptake and store lipids in the form of lipid droplets, providing building blocks for membrane synthesis, to facilitate proliferation and growth. Mechanisms of lipid uptake, lipid droplet dynamics and their contribution to cancer growth have yet to be defined. This work is focused on elucidating the prostate cancer-specific modifications in lipid storage pathways so that these modified gene products can be identified and therapeutically targeted.  Methods:   To identify genes that promote lipid droplet formation and storage, the expression profiles of candidate genes were assessed and compared between peripheral blood mononuclear cells and prostate cancer cells. Subsequently, differentially expressed genes were inhibited and growth assays performed to elucidate their role in the growth of the cancer cells. Cell cycle, apoptosis and autophagy assays were performed to ascertain the mechanism of growth inhibition.  Results:   Our results indicate that DGAT1, ABHD5, ACAT1 and ATGL are overexpressed in prostate cancer cells compared to PBMCs and of these overexpressed genes, DGAT1 and ABHD5 aid in the growth of the prostate cancer cells. Blocking the expression of both DGAT1 and ABHD5 results in inhibition of growth, cell cycle block and cell death. DGAT1 siRNA treatment inhibits lipid droplet formation and leads to autophagy where as ABHD5 siRNA treatment promotes accumulation of lipid droplets and leads to apoptosis. Both the siRNA treatments reduce AMPK phosphorylation, a key regulator of lipid metabolism. While DGAT1 siRNA reduces phosphorylation of ACC, the rate limiting enzyme in de novo fat synthesis and triggers phosphorylation of raptor and ULK-1 inducing autophagy and cell death, ABHD5 siRNA decreases P70S6 phosphorylation, leading to PARP cleavage, apoptosis and cell death. Interestingly, DGAT-1 is involved in the synthesis of triacylglycerol where as ABHD5 is a hydrolase and participates in the fatty acid oxidation process, yet inhibition of both enzymes similarly promotes prostate cancer cell death.  Conclusion:   Inhibition of either DGAT1 or ABHD5 leads to prostate cancer cell death. Both DGAT1 and ABHD5 can be selectively targeted to block prostate cancer cell growth.""","""['Ranjana Mitra', 'Thuc T Le', 'Priyatham Gorjala', 'Oscar B Goodman Jr']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Loss of ephrin B2 receptor (EPHB2) sets lipid rheostat by regulating proteins DGAT1 and ATGL inducing lipid droplet storage in prostate cancer cells.', 'The ATGL lipase cooperates with ABHD5 to mobilize lipids for hepatitis C virus assembly.', 'Loss of ABHD5 promotes the aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells.', 'Critical roles for α/β hydrolase domain 5 (ABHD5)/comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58) at the lipid droplet interface and beyond.', 'The important role of epidermal triacylglycerol metabolism for maintenance of the skin permeability barrier function.', 'Host Cell Response to Rotavirus Infection with Emphasis on Virus-Glycan Interactions, Cholesterol Metabolism, and Innate Immunity.', 'Adding fuel to the fire: The lipid droplet and its associated proteins in cancer progression.', 'Lipid Metabolism in Glioblastoma: From De Novo Synthesis to Storage.', 'Recent Advances on the Role of ATGL in Cancer.', 'Role of HIF-1α/ERRα in Enhancing Cancer Cell Metabolism and Promoting Resistance of Endometrial Cancer Cells to Pyroptosis.']"""

Here, we report that PSMD10 expression is stimulated by the histone demethylase JMJD2A/KDM4A and its interaction partner, the ETV1 transcription factor, in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Global analysis of expression patterns revealed that PSMD10 mRNA levels are positively correlated with those of both JMJD2A and ETV1. In human prostate tumors, PSMD10 is highly overexpressed at the protein level and correlates with JMJD2A overexpression; further, PSMD10 expression is enhanced in the prostates of transgenic JMJD2A mice. Moreover, PSMD10 is particularly overexpressed in high Gleason score prostate tumors. Downregulation of PSMD10 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells impaired their growth, indicating that PSMD10 may exert a pro-oncogenic function in the prostate. Lastly, we observed that PSMD10 expression is correlated to YAP1, a component of the Hippo signaling pathway and whose gene promoter is regulated by JMJD2A, and that PSMD10 can cooperate with YAP1 in stimulating LNCaP cell growth. Altogether, these data indicate that PSMD10 is a novel downstream effector of JMJD2A and suggest that inhibition of the JMJD2A histone demethylase by small molecule drugs may be effective to curtail the oncogenic activity of PSMD10 in various PSMD10-overexpressing tumors.""","""['Tae-Dong Kim', 'Sangphil Oh', 'Stan A Lightfoot', 'Sook Shin', 'Jonathan D Wren', 'Ralf Janknecht']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Med""","""['Histone demethylase JMJD2A drives prostate tumorigenesis through transcription factor ETV1.', 'ETS transcription factor ERG cooperates with histone demethylase KDM4A.', 'Oncogenic features of the JMJD2A histone demethylase in breast cancer.', 'The role of the histone demethylase KDM4A in cancer.', 'Gankyrin as a potential target for tumor therapy: evidence and perspectives.', 'Promotion of colorectal cancer by transcription factor BHLHE40 involves upregulation of ADAM19 and KLF7.', 'Gankyrin-mediated interaction between cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages facilitates prostate cancer progression and androgen deprivation therapy resistance.', 'Interaction between PSMD10 and GRP78 accelerates endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated hepatic apoptosis induced by homocysteine.', 'Sumoylation of transcription factor ETV1 modulates its oncogenic potential in prostate cancer.', 'Cooperation between ETS transcription factor ETV1 and histone demethylase JMJD1A in colorectal cancer.']"""

Standard metrics fail to show the overall impact for patients and the population.  Methods:   The available data consist of a population of ∼2.5 million patients and include all patients recorded as being diagnosed with melanoma, prostate, bladder, breast, colon, rectum, lung, ovarian and stomach cancers in England between 1998 and 2013. We estimated the average loss in expectation of life per patient in years and the proportion of life lost for a range of cancer types, separately by deprivation group. In addition, estimates for the total number of years lost due to each cancer were also obtained.  Results:   Lung and stomach cancers result in the highest overall loss for males and females in all deprivation groups in terms of both absolute life years lost and loss as a proportion of expected life remaining. Female lung cancer patients in the least- and most-deprived group lose 14.4 and 13.8 years on average, respectively, that is translated as 86.1% and 87.3% of their average expected life years remaining. Melanoma, prostate and breast cancers have the lowest overall loss.

However, there is a lack of population-based studies on blood levels of these molecules and cancer risk.  Methods:   Associations between pre-diagnostic serum albumin, bilirubin and uric acid and the risks of common cancers as well as cancer death in the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort were evaluated by multivariable Cox regression analyses. A case-cohort sample including a random subcohort (n=2739) and all incident cases of breast (n=627), prostate (n=554), colorectal (n=256), and lung cancer (n=195) as well as cancer death (n=761) that occurred between baseline (1994-1998) and 2009 was used.  Results:   Albumin levels were inversely associated with breast cancer risk (hazard ratioQuartile 4 vs Quartile 1 (95% CI): 0.71 (0.51, 0.99), Plinear trend=0.004) and overall cancer mortality (HRQ4 vs Q1 (95% CI): 0.64 (0.48, 0.86), Plinear trend<0.001) after multivariable adjustment. Uric acid levels were also inversely associated with breast cancer risk (HRQ4 vs Q1 (95% CI): 0.72 (0.53, 0.99), Plinear trend=0.043) and cancer mortality (HRQ4 vs Q1 (95% CI): 0.75 (0.58, 0.98), Plinear trend=0.09). There were no significant associations between albumin or uric acid and prostate, lung and colorectal cancer. Serum bilirubin was not associated with any cancer end point.

Healthcare costs have been reported to be highest during the last year of life, but studies on the actual costs of palliative care are scarce.  Aim:   To explore the resource use and costs of palliative care among end-stage breast, colorectal and prostate cancer patients after termination of life-prolonging oncological treatments, that is, during the palliative care period.  Design:   A real-life longitudinal register- and questionnaire-based study of cancer patients' resource use and costs.  Participants:   In total, 70 patients in palliative care with no ongoing oncological treatments were recruited from the Helsinki University Hospital or from the local hospice. Healthcare costs, productivity costs and informal care costs were included.  Results:   The mean duration of the palliative care period was 179 days. The healthcare cost accounted for 55%, informal care for 27% and productivity costs for 18% of the total costs. The last 2 weeks of life contributed to 37% of the healthcare cost. The costs of the palliative care period were higher in patients living alone, which was mostly caused by inpatient care ( p = 0.018).  Conclusion:   The 45% share of indirect costs is substantial in end-of-life care. The healthcare costs increase towards death, which is especially true of patients living alone.

Methods:   This is a prospective IRB-approved study of 68 patients with documented biochemical recurrence after primary local therapy consisting of radical prostatectomy (n = 50), post radiation therapy (n = 9) or both (n = 9), with negative conventional imaging. All 68 patients underwent whole-body 18F-DCFBC PET/CT, and 62 also underwent mpMRI within one month. Lesion detection with 18F-DCFBC was correlated with mpMRI findings and pre-scan PSA levels. The impact of 18F-DCFBC PET/CT on clinical management and treatment decisions was established after 6 months' patient clinical follow-up.  Results:   Forty-one patients (60.3%) showed at least one positive 18F-DCFBC lesion, for a total of 79 lesions, 30 in the prostate bed, 39 in lymph nodes, and ten in distant sites. Tumor recurrence was confirmed by either biopsy (13/41 pts), serial CT/MRI (8/41) or clinical follow-up (15/41); there was no confirmation in five patients, who continue to be observed. The 18F-DCFBC and mpMRI findings were concordant in 39 lesions (49.4%), and discordant in 40 lesions (50.6%); the majority (n = 32/40) of the latter occurring because the recurrence was located outside the mpMRI field of view. 18F-DCFBC PET positivity rates correlated with PSA values and 15%, 46%, 83%, and 77% were seen in patients with PSA values <0.5, 0.5 to <1.0, 1.0 to <2.0, and ≥2.0 ng/mL, respectively. The optimal cut-off PSA value to predict a positive 18F-DCFBC scan was 0.78 ng/mL (AUC = 0.764). A change in clinical management occurred in 51.2% (21/41) of patients with a positive 18F-DCFBC result, generally characterized by starting a new treatment in 19 patients or changing the treatment plan in two patients.  Conclusions: 18F-DCFBC detects recurrences in 60.3% of a population of patients with biochemical recurrence, but results are dependent on PSA levels.

Activation of androgen receptor (AR) and its variants' expression along with the downstream signals are mostly important for disease progression. However, the mechanism for marked increases of AR signals and its expression is still unclear. Here, we revealed that various spliceosome genes are aberrantly induced by RNA-binding protein PSF, leading to enhancement of the splicing activities for AR expression. Our high-speed sequence analyses identified global PSF-binding transcripts. PSF was shown to stabilize and activate key long noncoding RNAs and AR-regulated gene expressions in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, mRNAs of spliceosome-related genes are putative primary targets of PSF. Their gene expressions are up-regulated by PSF in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Moreover, PSF coordinated these spliceosome proteins to form a complex to promote AR splicing and expression.

However, recent studies indicate that a subset of prostate cancer may express significant levels of PD-L1. Furthermore, the androgen antagonist enzalutamide has been shown to upregulate PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer preclinical models. In this study, we evaluated the effect of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and leuprolide (Neo-AAPL) on PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer.Experimental Design: Radical prostatectomy (RP) tissues were collected from 44 patients with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer who underwent RP after Neo-AAPL treatment. Untreated prostate cancer tissues were collected from 130 patients, including 44 matched controls for the Neo-AAPL cases. Tumor PD-L1 expression was detected by IHC using validated anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ cells were analyzed in trial cases and matched controls. Expression of DNA mismatch repair genes was examined in PD-L1-positive tumors.Results: Neo-AAPL-treated tumors showed a trend toward decreased PD-L1 positivity compared with matched controls (7% vs. 21% having ≥1% positive tumor cells; P = 0.062). Treated tumors also harbored significantly fewer tumor-infiltrating CD8+ cells (P = 0.029). In 130 untreated prostate cancers, African American ethnicity, elevated serum PSA, and small prostate independently predicted tumor PD-L1 positivity. Loss of MSH2 expression was observed in 1 of 21 PD-L1-positive tumors.Conclusions: A subset of prostate cancer expresses PD-L1, which is not increased by Neo-AAPL treatment, indicating that combining Neo-AAPL treatment with PD-L1/PD-1 blockade may not be synergistic.

Our results showed that GPC5 was lowly expressed in PCa cell lines. Upregulation of GPC5 significantly inhibited PCa cell proliferation and invasion in vitro as well as attenuated tumor growth in vivo. We also found that overexpression of GPC5 inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation, which was mediated by Sp1. Taken together, we suggest GPC5 as a tumor suppressor in PCa and provide promising therapeutic strategies for PCa.""","""['Yu Sun', 'Kai Xu', 'Miao He', 'Guilian Fan', 'Hongming Lu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Res""","""['Glypican-5 suppresses Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of the lung adenocarcinoma by competitively binding to Wnt3a.', 'MicroRNA-301b promotes the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells through enhancing activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling via targeting Glypican-5.', 'GPC5, a novel epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor, inhibits tumor growth by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'The Glypican proteoglycans show intrinsic interactions with Wnt-3a in human prostate cancer cells that are not always associated with cascade activation.', 'miR-15a-3p Suppresses Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation and Invasion by Targeting SLC39A7 Via Downregulating Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.', 'Proteoglycans Determine the Dynamic Landscape of EMT and Cancer Cell Stemness.', 'The novel lncRNA GPC5-AS1 stabilizes GPC5 mRNA by competitively binding with miR-93/106a to suppress gastric cancer cell proliferation.', 'Glycosylation Changes in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'LncRNA Hmrhl regulates expression of cancer related genes in chronic myelogenous leukemia through chromatin association.', 'SP1 Expression and the Clinicopathological Features of Tumors: A Meta-Analysis and Bioinformatics Analysis.']"""

We studied the incidence of PD before and after radiotherapy for painful bone metastases. Furthermore, we aimed to identify factors predictive for PD.  Methods:   Between 1996 and 1998, the Dutch Bone Metastasis Study included 1157 patients with painful bone metastases. Patients were randomized between two fractionation schedules. The study showed a pain response of 74% in both groups. Patients filled out weekly questionnaires for 13 weeks, then monthly for two years. The questionnaires included a subscale for PD on the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist. We used generalized estimating equations and multivariable logistic regression analyses.  Results:   At baseline, 290 patients (27%) had a high level of PD. For the entire group, the level of PD remained constant over time. The majority of patients with a low level of PD at baseline remained at a low level during follow-up. In patients with a high level of PD at baseline, the mean level of PD decreased after treatment and stabilized around the cutoff level. Female patients, higher age, worse performance, lower pain score and worse self-reported QoL were associated with an increased chance of PD, although the model showed moderate discriminative power.  Conclusions:   A substantial proportion of patients had a high level of PD before and after radiotherapy for painful bone metastases. Most patients who reported high levels of PD when referred for palliative radiotherapy remained at high levels thereafter. Therefore, screening of PD prior to treatment seems appropriate, in order to select patients requiring intervention.""","""['Paulien G Westhoff', 'Alexander de Graeff', 'Evelyn M Monninkhof', 'Maaike J Berveling', 'Marco van Vulpen', 'Jan Willem H Leer', 'Corrie A M Marijnen', 'Anna K L Reyners', 'Yvette M van der Linden;Dutch Bone Metastasis Study Group']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Effect of Radiotherapy on Painful Bone Metastases: A Secondary Analysis of the NCIC Clinical Trials Group Symptom Control Trial SC.23.', 'Quality of Life in Relation to Pain Response to Radiation Therapy for Painful Bone Metastases.', 'Course of Quality of Life After Radiation Therapy for Painful Bone Metastases: A Detailed Analysis From the Dutch Bone Metastasis Study.', 'Evaluation of quality of life outcomes following palliative radiotherapy in bone metastases: A literature review.', 'The role of radiotherapy in bone metastases: A critical review of current literature.', 'Psychosocial distress in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy: a prospective national cohort of 1042 patients in Germany.', 'Analgesia and curative effect of pamidronate disodium combined with chemotherapy on elderly patients with advanced metastatic bone cancer.']"""

These patients can be offered nonoperative organ-preserving treatment, the so-called watch-and-wait policy. The main goal of this watch-and-wait policy is an anticipated improved quality of life and functional outcome in comparison with a total mesorectal excision, while maintaining a good oncological outcome.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to compare the quality of life of watch-and-wait patients with a matched-controlled group of patients who underwent chemoradiation and surgery (total mesorectal excision group).  Design:   This was a matched controlled study.  Settings:   This study was conducted at multiple centers.  Patients:   The study population consisted of 2 groups: 41 patients after a watch-and-wait policy and 41 matched patients after chemoradiation and surgery. Patients were matched on sex, age, tumor stage, and tumor height. All patients were disease free at the moment of recruitment after a minimal follow-up of 2 years.  Main outcome measures:   Quality of life was measured by validated questionnaires covering general quality of life (Short Form 36, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30), disease-specific total mesorectal excision (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-CR38), defecation problems (Vaizey and low anterior resection syndrome scores), sexual problems (International Index of Erectile Function and Female Sexual Function Index), and urinary dysfunction (International Prostate Symptom Score).  Results:   The watch-and-wait group showed better physical and cognitive function, better physical and emotional roles, and better global health status compared with the total mesorectal excision group. The watch-and-wait patients showed fewer problems with defecation and sexual and urinary tract function.  Limitations:   This study only focused on watch-and-wait patients who achieved a sustained complete response for 2 years. In addition, this is a study with a limited number of patients and with quality-of-life measurements on nonpredefined and variable intervals after surgery.  Conclusions:   After a successful watch-and-wait approach, the quality of life was better than after chemoradiation and surgery on several domains. However, chemoradiation therapy on its own is not without long-term side effects, because one-third of the watch-and-wait patients experienced major low anterior resection syndrome symptoms, compared with 66.7% of the patients in the total mesorectal excision group.

Training and surgeon experience with this approach has not been assessed previously in America.  Objective:   The purpose of this study was to characterize a structured training program and to determine the experience of delegate surgeons.  Design:   Data were assimilated from an anonymous, online survey delivered to attendees on course completion. Data on surgeon performance during hands-on cadaveric dissection were collected prospectively.  Settings:   This study was conducted at a single tertiary colorectal surgery referral center, and cadaveric hands-on training was conducted at a specialized surgeon education center.  Main outcome measures:   The main outcome measurement was the use of the course and surgeon experience posttraining.  Results:   During a 12-month period, eight 2-day transanal total mesorectal excision courses were conducted. Eighty-one colorectal surgeons successfully completed the course. During cadaveric dissection, 71% achieved a complete (Quirke 3) specimen; 26% were near complete (Quirke 2), and 3% were incomplete (Quirke 1). A total of 9.1% demonstrated dissection in the incorrect plane, whereas 4.5% created major injury to the rectum or surrounding structures, excluding the prostate. Thirty eight (46.9%) of 81 surgeon delegates responded to an online survey. Of survey respondents, 94.6% believed training should be required before performing transanal total mesorectal excision. Posttraining, 94.3% of surgeon delegates planned to use transanal total mesorectal excision for distal-third rectal cancers, 74.3% for middle-third cancers, and 8.6% for proximal-third cancers. The most significant complication reported was urethral injury; 5 were reported by the subset of survey respondents who had performed this operation postcourse.  Limitations:   The study was limited by inherent reporting bias, including observer and recall biases.  Conclusions:   Although this structured training program for transanal total mesorectal excision was found to be useful by the majority of respondents, the risk of iatrogenic injury after training remains high, suggesting that this training pedagogy alone is insufficient.

Here, we show that an alternatively spliced isoform of syntaphilin (SNPH), a cytoskeletal regulator of mitochondrial movements in neurons, is directed to mitochondria of tumor cells. Mitochondrial SNPH buffers oxidative stress and maintains complex II-dependent bioenergetics, sustaining local tumor growth while restricting mitochondrial redistribution to the cortical cytoskeleton and tumor cell motility. Conversely, introduction of stress stimuli to the microenvironment, including hypoxia, acutely lowered SNPH levels, resulting in bioenergetics defects and increased superoxide production. In turn, this suppressed tumor cell proliferation but increased tumor cell invasion via greater mitochondrial trafficking to the cortical cytoskeleton. Loss of SNPH or expression of an SNPH mutant lacking the mitochondrial localization sequence resulted in increased metastatic dissemination in xenograft or syngeneic tumor models in vivo. Accordingly, tumor cells that acquired the ability to metastasize in vivo constitutively downregulated SNPH and exhibited higher oxidative stress, reduced cell proliferation, and increased cell motility. Therefore, SNPH is a stress-regulated mitochondrial switch of the cell proliferation-motility balance in cancer, and its pathway may represent a therapeutic target.""","""['M Cecilia Caino', 'Jae Ho Seo', 'Yuan Wang', 'Dayana B Rivadeneira', 'Dmitry I Gabrilovich', 'Eui Tae Kim', 'Ashani T Weeraratna', 'Lucia R Languino', 'Dario C Altieri']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['Syntaphilin Ubiquitination Regulates Mitochondrial Dynamics and Tumor Cell Movements.', 'A neuronal network of mitochondrial dynamics regulates metastasis.', 'Docking of axonal mitochondria by syntaphilin controls their mobility and affects short-term facilitation.', 'Mitochondrial Caseinolytic Protease P: A Possible Novel Prognostic Marker and Therapeutic Target in Cancer.', 'Mitochondria on the move: emerging paradigms of organelle trafficking in tumour plasticity and metastasis.', 'Syntaphilin Regulates Neutrophil Migration in Cancer.', 'Mitochondria in cancer: clean windmills or stressed tinkerers?', 'Miro proteins and their role in mitochondrial transfer in cancer and beyond.', 'Roles of mitochondrial genetics in cancer metastasis.', 'Mitochondrial adaptation in cancer drug resistance: prevalence, mechanisms, and management.']"""

GR expression is silenced in prostate cancer by a combination of AR binding and EZH2-mediated repression at the GR locus, but is restored in advanced prostate cancers upon reversion of both repressive signals. Remarkably, BET bromodomain inhibition resensitizes drug-resistant tumors to Enz by selectively impairing the GR signaling axis via this enhancer.

In this work, we estimate the radiation dosimetry for this ligand labeled with the alpha-emitter 213Bi.  Methods:   Three patients with metastatic prostate cancer underwent PET scans 0.1 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h and 5 h after injection of 68Ga-PSMA-617. Source organs were kidneys, liver, spleen, salivary glands, bladder, red marrow and representative tumor lesions. The imaging nuclide 68Ga was extrapolated to the half-life of 213Bi. The residence times of 213Bi were forwarded to the instable daughter nuclides. OLINDA was used for dosimetry calculation. Results are discussed in comparison to literature data for 225Ac-PSMA-617.  Results:   Assuming a relative biological effectiveness of 5 for alpha radiation, the dosimetry estimate revealed equivalent doses of mean 8.1 Sv RBE5/GBq for salivary glands, 8.1 Sv RBE5/GBq for kidneys and 0.52 Sv RBE5/GBq for red marrow. Liver (1.2 Sv RBE5/GBq), spleen (1.4 Sv RBE5/GBq), bladder (0.28 Sv RBE5/GBq) and other organs (0.26 SvRBE5/GBq) were not dose-limiting. The effective dose is 0.56 Sv RBE5/GBq. Tumor lesions were in the range 3.2-9.0 SvRBE5/GBq (median 7.6 SvRBE5/GBq). Kidneys would limit the cumulative treatment activity to 3.7 GBq; red marrow might limit the maximum single fraction to 2 GBq. Despite promising results, the therapeutic index was inferior compared to 225Ac-PSMA-617.  Conclusions:   Dosimetry of 213Bi-PSMA-617 is in a range traditionally considered reasonable for clinical application. Nevertheless, compared to 225Ac-PSMA-617, it suffers from higher perfusion-dependent off-target radiation and a longer biological half-life of PSMA-617 in dose-limiting organs than the physical half-life of 213Bi, rendering this nuclide as a second choice radiolabel for targeted alpha therapy of prostate cancer.""","""['Clemens Kratochwil', 'Karl Schmidt', 'Ali Afshar-Oromieh', 'Frank Bruchertseifer', 'Hendrik Rathke', 'Alfred Morgenstern', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Frederik L Giesel']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Radiation Dosimetry for 177Lu-PSMA I&T in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Absorbed Dose in Normal Organs and Tumor Lesions.', 'Examining Absorbed Doses of Indigenously Developed 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients at Baseline and During Course of Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy.', 'Post-therapeutic dosimetry of 177Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PSMA radioligand therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'A Walk with Lu-177 PSMA: How Close we Have Reached from Bench to Bedside?', 'Organotrifluoroborate enhances tumor targeting of fibroblast activation protein inhibitors for targeted radionuclide therapy.', 'Targeted Radiation and Immune Therapies-Advances and Opportunities for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Development of radiopharmaceuticals for targeted alpha therapy: Where do we stand?', 'Effects of Bismuth Exposure on the Human Kidney-A Systematic Review.', 'Current Status of PSMA-Targeted Radioligand Therapy in the Era of Radiopharmaceutical Therapy Acquiring Marketing Authorization.']"""

We recently demonstrated that expression of TPα and TPβ is increased in PCa, differentially correlating with Gleason grade and with altered CpG methylation of the individual Prm1/Prm3 regions within the TBXA2R. The current study sought to localise the sites of CpG methylation within Prm1 and Prm3, and to identify the main transcription factors regulating TPβ expression through Prm3 in the prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines. Bisulfite sequencing revealed extensive differences in the pattern and status of CpG methylation of the individual Prm1 and Prm3 regions that regulate TPα and TPβ expression, respectively, within the TBXA2R. More specifically, Prm1 is predominantly hypomethylated while Prm3 is hypermethylated across its entire sequence in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Furthermore, the tumour suppressors FOXP1 and NKX3.1, strongly implicated in PCa development, were identified as key transcription factors regulating TPβ expression through Prm3 in both PCa cell lines. Specific siRNA-disruption of FOXP1 and NKX3.1 each coincided with up-regulated TPβ protein and mRNA expression, while genetic-reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses confirmed that both FOXP1 and NKX3.1 bind to cis‑elements within Prm3 to transcriptionally repress TPβ in the PCa lines.

We further evaluated the effects of Abi on steroid metabolism of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Androgen-responsive cell lines metabolized pregnenolone primarily to mitogenic steroid 5α-pregnan-3β,6α-diol-20-one under serum starvation. Co-administration of Abi lead to detectable concentrations of the Abi metabolite Δ4-Abi (D4A), known to inhibit enzymes other than CYP17A1 in steroid metabolism. In addition, co-administration of Abi abrogated pregnenolone metabolism and resulted in a CYP17A1-independent significant increase of DHEA (13- to >100-fold) and DHT (2.5-fold) in androgen-responsive cells. Our results demonstrate the CYP17A1-independent formation of 5α-pregnan-3β,6α-diol-20-one by androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells under serum starvation and its inhibition by Abi. Its metabolism from pregnenolone suggests a major steroidogenesis shift in these cells, hinting at a neuroendocrine transdifferentiation phenomenon. The marked increase of DHEA levels by Abi resembles the steroidogenic pathways in nervous tissue, in a manner that precludes CYP17A1 activity. To which extent these processes are responsible or involved in the development of resistance to Abi, needs to be further elucidated.""","""['Antonio G Gomes de Mello Martins', 'Giuseppe Allegretta', 'Gerhard Unteregger', 'Jörg Haupenthal', 'Jens Eberhard', 'Michael Hoffmann', 'Jill A van der Zee', 'Kerstin Junker', 'Michael Stöckle', 'Rolf Müller', 'Rolf W Hartmann', 'Carsten-H Ohlmann']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Intratumoral de novo steroid synthesis activates androgen receptor in castration-resistant prostate cancer and is upregulated by treatment with CYP17A1 inhibitors.', 'Dihydrotestosterone synthesis pathways from inactive androgen 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol in prostate cancer cells: Inhibition of intratumoural 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities by abiraterone.', 'Conversion of abiraterone to D4A drives anti-tumour activity in prostate cancer.', 'Assessment of steroidogenesis and steroidogenic enzyme functions.', 'Pathways and genes involved in steroid hormone metabolism in male pigs: a review and update.', 'Novel biomarkers predict prognosis and drug-induced neuroendocrine differentiation in patients with prostate cancer.', 'High intratumoral dihydrotestosterone is associated with antiandrogen resistance in VCaP prostate cancer xenografts in castrated mice.']"""

Therefore, understanding the nature of the genes involved in this process has become a priority. BACH1, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor, has been shown to transcriptionally regulate expression of a range of genes that are associated with breast cancer metastasis. However, the exact role and the underlying molecular mechanism of BACH1 in prostate cancer remain unclear. This study aims to explore the expression of BACH1 in prostate cancer tissues and the effect of BACH1 suppression on prostate cancer cell behavior.  Materials and methods:   In this study, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure BACH1 expression in prostate adenocarcinoma tissues and two metastasis-derived prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and LNCaP. We also used immunohistochemical (IHC) staining to measure BACH1 protein expression in prostate adenocarcinoma and matched normal tissue samples. In the following BACH1 expression was silenced in DU145 cells using siRNA as well. Knockdown was confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The cytotoxic effects of BACH1-siRNA on DU145 cells were determined using an MTT assay. The migration and invasive capacity of DU145 cells were examined by scratch wound healing assay and matrigel invasion assay, respectively. We also used qRT-PCR to study the effect of BACH1 silencing on the expression levels of metastasis-related genes.  Results:   We find that the expression of BACH1 mRNA and protein in prostate cancer tissues is significantly higher than in matched normal prostate tissues (p < .05). In addition, DU145 and LNCaP cells exhibited 4.25-fold and 3.45-fold higher levels of BACH1 compared to HFF cell line. BACH1-siRNA significantly reduced both mRNA and protein expression levels in DU145 cells. More importantly, we show that BACH1 promotes key features of metastasis, as BACH1-siRNA treatment significantly reduced cell invasion and migration by changing the expression levels of a number of metastasis-related genes in vitro.  Conclusions:   BACH1 is overexpressed in prostate cancer. Because this promotes invasion and migration, it may facilitate metastasis of prostate cancer. Thus, BACH1 is a potential therapeutic target for metastatic prostate cancer. BACH1 silencing therapy can be considered as a novel and effective adjuvant in prostate cancer targeted therapies.""","""['Neda Shajari', 'Sadaf Davudian', 'Tohid Kazemi', 'Behzad Mansoori', 'Shima Salehi', 'Vahid Khaze Shahgoli', 'Dariush Shanehbandi', 'Ali Mohammadi', 'Pascal H G Duijf', 'Behzad Baradaran']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol""","""['BACH1 silencing by siRNA inhibits migration of HT-29 colon cancer cells through reduction of metastasis-related genes.', 'Therapeutic effects of bach1 siRNA on human breast adenocarcinoma cell line.', 'Silencing of bach1 gene by small interfering RNA-mediation regulates invasive and expression level of miR-203, miR-145, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and CXCR4 receptor in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells.', 'A Novel Therapeutic Target, BACH1, Regulates Cancer Metabolism.', 'BACH1, the master regulator gene: A novel candidate target for cancer therapy.', 'BACH1-induced ferroptosis drives lymphatic metastasis by repressing the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids.', 'Iron in Cancer Progression: Does BACH1 Promote Metastasis by Altering Iron Homeostasis?', 'Uncovering BTB and CNC Homology1 (BACH1) as a Novel Cancer Therapeutic Target.', 'Metformin exerts an antitumoral effect on papillary thyroid cancer cells through altered cell energy metabolism and sensitized by BACH1 depletion.', ""Bach1 derepression is neuroprotective in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.""]"""

Methods:   The cell proliferation was detected using MTT assay and colony formation, and cells migration and invasion were also analyzed. Luciferase reporter assay was carried out to explore the correlation between miR-106a and PTEN. Besides, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and western blot were carried out to measure the mRNA and protein levels in prostate tissues and PCa cells.

The overexpression of miR-106a significantly promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells. Besides, we confirmed that PTEN was regulated by miR-106a expression and was a direct target of miR-106a. Most importantly, we further found that miR-106a could promote the PCa cells xenograft growth in the nude mice by targeting PTEN, which was significantly downregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines and was closely related with PCa metastasis.

We have previously reported that resveratrol and synthetic analogs of resveratrol with a higher bioavailability inhibit the synthesis of androgens in human adrenocortical H295R cells. Now we have studied the antiandrogenic properties of resveratrol, piceatannol and analogs in two different prostate cell lines; LNCaP and RWPE. LNCaP carry a T877A mutation in the androgen receptor while RWPE has a wild-type androgen receptor. We found that resveratrol, piceatannol and all studied analogs were able to inhibit a dihydrotestosterone-induced activation of the androgen receptor, showing that they act as antiandrogens. In LNCaP cells, all studied compounds were able to statistically significantly decrease the androgenic signaling in concentrations ≥1μM and the synthetic analogs trimethylresveratrol (RSVTM) and tetramethylpiceatannol (PICTM) were the most potent compounds. RWPE cells were not as responsive to the studied compounds as the LNCaP cells. A statistically significant decrease in the androgenic signaling was observed at concentrations ≤5μM for most compounds and RSVTM was found to be the most potent compound. Further, we studied the effects of resveratrol, piceatannol and analogs on the levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in LNCaP cells and found that all studied compounds decreased the level of PSA and that the synthetic analogs diacetylresveratrol (RSVDA), triacetylresveratrol (RSVTA) and RSVTM were the most potent compounds, decreasing the PSA level by approx. 50% at concentrations ≥10μM. In a cell-free receptor binding assay we were unable to show binding of resveratrol or analogs to the ligand binding domain of the androgen receptor, indicating that the observed effects are mediated via other mechanisms than direct ligand competition.

Key exclusion criteria included recent antibiotic use, significant gastrointestinal disorders, hormonal or systemic therapy for prostate cancer. Computational genomics analysis was performed on collected stool samples using MetaPhlAn2 and HUMAnN2 platforms. Linear discriminant analysis effect size method was used to support high-dimensional class comparisons to find biologically relevant features. Kruskal-Wallis sum-rank test was used to detect features with significant differential abundance with respect to class, with biological consistency investigated using a set of pairwise tests among subclasses using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, both to an α ≤0.05.  Results:   Higher relative abundance of Bacteriodes massiliensis was seen in prostate cancer cases compared to controls. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Eubacterium rectalie had higher relative abundance among controls. Biologically significant differences were also found in relative gene, pathway, and enzyme abundance.

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 7710 cases of autopsies (4011 men, 3699 women, median age of 80 years), and analyzed the characteristics of metastasis of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma in each organ.  Results:   The total number of cases with adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or urothelial carcinoma was 2856, and most of them were adenocarcinomas. Among them, 1604 had metastatic lesions, and patients with metastasis were younger than those without metastasis. The major primary organs of adenocarcinoma were the stomach, colon, lung, prostate, gallbladder and pancreas, whereas those for squamous cell carcinoma were the lung, esophagus and uterus. Urothelial carcinoma cases were found in the urinary bladder, kidney and ureter. Metastatic adenocarcinomas mainly originated from the stomach, colon, lung, pancreas and gallbladder. Metastatic squamous cell carcinomas were from the lung, esophagus and uterus, whereas the kidney, bladder and ureter were the primary origins of metastatic urothelial carcinomas. Squamous cell carcinoma showed the highest incidence of metastasis, suggestive of it being of an aggressive phenotype. Furthermore, metastatic ability and the preferred metastatic sites varied among primary organs.  Conclusions:   We revealed an accurate incidence and the characteristics of metastatic cancer in a large-scale autopsy study of older Japanese patients from one institution.

However, these drugs act differently on various types of cancers. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of statins and bisphosphonates on the metabolism (NADP⁺/NADPH-relation) of highly proliferative tumor cell lines from different origins (PC-3 prostate carcinoma, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, U-2 OS osteosarcoma) versus cells with a slower proliferation rate like MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. Global gene expression analysis revealed that after 6 days of treatment with pharmacologic doses of the statin simvastatin and of the bisphosphonate ibandronate, simvastatin regulated more than twice as many genes as ibandronate, including many genes associated with cell cycle progression. Upregulation of starvation-markers and a reduction of metabolism and associated NADPH production, an increase in autophagy, and a concomitant downregulation of H3K27 methylation was most significant in the fast-growing cancer cell lines.

Seminal exosomes were isolated and purified from 12 healthy donors using a 30% sucrose cushion-based exosome-isolation protocol, followed by characterization by western blot, transmission electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis before performing extensive liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry proteomics analysis. The identified proteins were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis, and seminal exosomes-associated proteins were selectively validated by western blot. A total of 1474 proteins were identified in all seminal exosomes samples, with Gene Ontology analysis demonstrating that these identified seminal exosomes-associated proteins were mostly linked to 'exosomes,' 'cytoplasm,' and 'cytosol.' Bioinformatics analysis indicated that these proteins were mainly involved in biologic processes, including metabolism, energy pathways, protein metabolism, cell growth and maintenance, and transport.

Methods:   A T1 phantom with 14 samples was imaged at eight centers with a common inversion-recovery spin-echo (IR-SE) protocol and a variable flip angle (VFA) protocol using seven flip angles, as well as site-specific protocols (VFA with different flip angles, variable repetition time, proton density, and Look-Locker inversion recovery). Factors influencing the accuracy (deviation from reference NMR T1 measurements) and repeatability were assessed using general linear mixed models. Interplatform reproducibility was assessed using coefficients of variation.  Results:   For the common IR-SE protocol, accuracy (median error across platforms = 1.4-5.5%) was influenced predominantly by T1 sample (P < 10-6 ), whereas test-retest repeatability (median error = 0.2-8.3%) was influenced by the scanner (P < 10-6 ).

Unfortunately, HSP90 inhibitors suffer from dose-limiting toxicities that hinder their clinical applications. Previously developed polymeric delivery systems for HSP90 inhibitors had either low drug content or low biological activity suggesting the need for better delivery system for HSP90 inhibitors.  Methods:   We developed a simplified synthetic strategy to prepare polyethylene glycol based water-soluble polymeric system for model HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GDM). We then investigated the effect of cathepsin B degradable linker and drug content in polymeric conjugates on their growth inhibitory property using DU145 (androgen independent) and LNCaP (androgen dependent) cell lines.  Results:   Water-soluble polymeric conjugates were synthesized with GDM content ranging from 9 to 30% wt/wt. We demonstrated the importance of cathepsin B degradable linker from the context of drug content and different prostate cancer cell lines. The most active conjugate against DU145 cells exhibited IC50 value of 2.9 μM. This was similar to the IC50 (2.1 μM) of small molecular drug aminohexane geldanamycin.  Conclusion:   Water-soluble polymeric conjugate with high drug content was synthesized that exhibited in-vitro growth inhibitory activity similar to small molecular weight HSP90 inhibitor.

The mutational and neoepitope features of the tumor were compared according to the four TMITs. We found that PD-L1/CD8A/CYT subgroups could not distinguish different mutation and neoantigen numbers in certain tumor types such as glioblastoma multiforme, prostate adenocarcinoma, and head and neck and lung squamous cell carcinoma. For the remaining tumor types, compared with TIMT II (low PD-L1 and CD8A/CYT), TIMT I (high PD-L1 and CD8A/CYT) had a significantly higher number of mutations or neoantigens in bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast and cervical cancer, colorectal, stomach and lung adenocarcinoma, and melanoma.

Quantitative histological and in vivo MRI assessments of non-heme cellular iron revealed that preclinical prostate tumor models could be differentiated according to hemosiderin iron accumulation-both in tumors and systemically. Monitoring cellular iron levels during ""off-label"" administration of the FDA-approved iron chelator deferiprone evidenced significant reductions in tumor size without extensive perturbation to these iron deposits. Spatial profiling of the iron-laden infiltrates further demonstrated that higher numbers of infiltrating macrophage iron deposits was associated with lower anti-tumor chelation therapy response.

ER expression in tumor lesions can be visualized by 18F-fluoroestradiol (18F-FES) PET, and AR expression has been visualized in prostate cancer patients with 18F-fluorodihydrotestosterone (18F-FDHT) PET. Our aim was to assess the concordance between 18F-FDHT and 18F-FES PET and tumor AR and ER expression measured immunohistochemically in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Methods: Patients with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer were eligible for the study, irrespective of tumor AR status. The concordance of 18F-FDHT and 18F-FES uptake on PET with immunohistochemical expression of AR and ER in biopsies of corresponding metastases was analyzed. Patients underwent 18F-FDHT PET and 18F-FES PET. A metastasis was biopsied within 8 wk of the PET procedures. Tumor samples with more than 10% and 1% nuclear tumor cell staining were considered, respectively, AR- and ER-positive. Correlations between PET uptake and semiquantitative immunohistochemical scoring (percentage positive cells × intensity) were calculated. The optimum threshold of SUV to discriminate positive and negative lesions for both AR and ER was determined by receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. Results: In the 13 evaluable patients, correlation (R2 ) between semiquantitative AR expression and 18F-FDHT uptake was 0.47 (P = 0.01) and between semiquantitative ER expression and 18F-FES uptake 0.78 (P = 0.01).

Materials and methods:   We obtained death certification data from the World Health Organization and population data from the Pan American Health Organization database for all neoplasms and selected cancer sites. We derived figures for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela. Using a logarithmic Poisson count data joinpoint model, we estimated number of deaths and age-standardized (world population) mortality rates in 2017.  Results:   Total cancer mortality rates are predicted to decline in all countries. The highest mortality rates for 2017 are in Cuba, i.e. 132.3/100 000 men and 93.3/100 000 women. Mexico had the lowest predicted rates, 64.7/100 000 men and 60.6/100 000 women. In contrast, the total number of cancer deaths is expected to rise due to population ageing and growth. Men showed declines in lung cancer trends in all countries and age groups considered, while only Colombian and Mexican women had downward trends. Stomach and (cervix) uteri rates are predicted to continue their declines, though mortality from these neoplasms remains comparatively high. Colorectal, breast and prostate cancer rates were predicted to decline moderately, as well as leukaemias. There was no clear pattern for pancreatic cancer. Between 1990 and 2017 about 420 000 cancer deaths were avoided in 5 of the 7 countries, no progress was observed in Brazil and Cuba.

In the present study we have investigated whether treatment of DU145 human prostate cancer cells affects anandamide (AEA) catabolic pathways. Additionally, we have investigated whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) can regulate the uptake of AEA into cells. Levels of AEA synthetic and catabolic enzymes were determined by qPCR. AEA uptake and hydrolysis in DU145 and RAW264.7 macrophage cells were assayed using AEA labeled in the arachidonic and ethanolamine portions of the molecule, respectively. Levels of AEA, related N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), prostaglandins (PG) and PG-ethanolamines (PG-EA) in DU145 cells and medium were quantitated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. TNFα treatment of DU145 cells increased mRNA levels of PTSG2 (gene of COX-2) and decreased the mRNA of the AEA synthetic enzyme N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine selective phospholipase D. mRNA levels of the AEA hydrolytic enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase were not changed. AEA uptake in both DU145 and RAW264.7 cells was inhibited by FAAH inhibition, but not by COX-2 inhibition, even in RAW264.7 cells where the expression of this enzyme had greatly been induced by lipopolysaccharide + interferon γ treatment. AEA and related NAEs were detected in DU145 cells, but PGs and PGE2-EA were only detected when the cells had been preincubated with 100 nM AEA. The data demonstrate that in DU145 cells, TNFα treatment changes the relative expression of the enzymes involved in the hydrolytic and oxygenation catabolic pathways for AEA. In RAW264.7 cells, COX-2, in contrast to FAAH, does not regulate the cellular accumulation of AEA.

A total of 2,267 genes and 49 miRNAs were differentially expressed between normal and tumor samples. The prediction analyses of target genes and integrative analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression revealed eleven genes and eight miRNAs which were validated by RT-qPCR in plasma samples from 102 untreated PCa patients and 50 cancer-free individuals. Two genes, OR51E2 and SIM2, and two miRNAs, miR-200c and miR-200b, showed significant association with PCa. Expression levels of these transcripts distinguished PCa patients from controls (67% sensitivity and 75% specificity).

A human CRPC cell line (PC3) was used in the current study. Gene expression patterns were evaluated using real time-PCR and western blot analysis. CCK-8 assay was used for assessing cell viability and proliferation, and a clonogenic assay was adopted to evaluate clonal proliferative capabilities. Induction of apoptotic cell death was analyzed via flow cytometry. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) were used for manipulating the expression of genes of interest. PC3 showed relatively higher expression levels of LIN28B and lower expression levels of let-7 miRNAs. Simvastatin treatment significantly inhibited cell viability and clonal proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the downregulated let-7 miRNA family was restored after simvastatin treatment. We further observed that human CRPC cells transfected with LIN28B-siRNA or shRNA also showed upregulated let-7 miRNAs. Finally, dual treatment with simvastatin and an NF-κB inhibitor (CAPE) synergistically induced apoptotic cell death, along with reduction of LIN28B expression, and restoration of let-7 miRNAs levels. Our data illustrate that simvastatin remarkably inhibits the growth of human CRPC cells by suppressing NF-κB and LIN28B and subsequently upregulating let-7 miRNAs. Moreover, concurrent treatment with simvastatin and an NF-κB inhibitor synergistically suppressed the growth of human CRPC cells, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for human CRPC treatment.""","""['Minyong Kang', 'Kyoung-Hwa Lee', 'Hye Sun Lee', 'Chang Wook Jeong', 'Ja Hyeon Ku', 'Hyeon Hoe Kim', 'Cheol Kwak']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Caffeic acid phenethyl ester induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via regulation of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.', 'Caffeic acid phenethyl ester suppressed growth and metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by inactivating the NF-κB pathway.', 'Combination simvastatin and metformin induces G1-phase cell cycle arrest and Ripk1- and Ripk3-dependent necrosis in C4-2B osseous metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Aberrant regulation of the LIN28A/LIN28B and let-7 loop in human malignant tumors and its effects on the hallmarks of cancer.', 'Multi-Level Regulatory Interactions between NF-κB and the Pluripotency Factor Lin28.', 'Co-Encapsulation of Simvastatin and Doxorubicin into pH-Sensitive Liposomes Enhances Antitumoral Activity in Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'RNA-Binding Proteins in Bladder Cancer.', 'The Metabolism Reprogramming of microRNA Let-7-Mediated Glycolysis Contributes to Autophagy and Tumor Progression.', 'Targeting Inflammatory Signaling in Prostate Cancer Castration Resistance.', 'Ras Signaling in Breast Cancer.']"""

We used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a murine prostate cancer model to evaluate tumor targeting of LNPs incorporating Dox and antiprostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) diabodies. Dox-LNPs were generated by mixing or covalent attachment to water soluble distearoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine-polyethylene glycol (DSPE-PEG)2000. Cu-64 PET imaging was performed with DOTA-conjugated Dox, PEG-LNP, or an anti-PSMA site-specific cysteine-diabody. Since the mixture Dox+PEG-LNP was unstable in serum, further studies utilized Dox covalently bound to LNP ± covalently bound DOTA-cys-diabody (cys-DB)-LNP. Blood clearance of covalent Dox-PEG-LNP was slower than Dox alone or Dox+PEG-LNP. PET imaging of 64Cu-DOTA-Dox-PEG-LNP reached a maximum of 10% ID/g in tumors compared with 3% ID/g of 64Cu-DOTA-Dox, due to the prolonged blood clearance. Mixing 64Cu-DOTA-cys-DB-PEG-LNP with covalent Dox-PEG-LNP gave LNPs containing both drug and tumor targeting cys-DB. The mixed LNPs exhibited increased tumor uptake (15% ID/g) versus untargeted 64Cu-DOTA-Dox-PEG-LNPs (10% ID/g) demonstrating feasibility of the approach. Based on these results, a therapy study with mixed LNPs containing cys-DB-LNP and either Dox-LNP or the antitubulin drug auristatin-LNP showed significant reduction of tumor growth with the auristatin-diabody-LNP mixture, but not the Dox-diabody-LNP mixture.""","""['Patty Wong', 'Lin Li', 'Junie Chea', 'Melissa K Delgado', 'Erasmus Poku', 'Barbara Szpikowska', 'Nicole Bowles', 'Megan Minnix', 'David Colcher', 'Jeffrey Y C Wong', 'John E Shively', 'Paul J Yazaki']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['PET imaging of 64Cu-DOTA-scFv-anti-PSMA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs): Enhanced tumor targeting over anti-PSMA scFv or untargeted LNPs.', 'Site-specific conjugation of monodispersed DOTA-PEGn to a thiolated diabody reveals the effect of increasing peg size on kidney clearance and tumor uptake with improved 64-copper PET imaging.', '111In- and IRDye800CW-Labeled PLA-PEG Nanoparticle for Imaging Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Expressing Tissues.', ""64Cu-1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid-polyethylene glycol 12 anti–tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 diabody."", ""64Cu-1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid-polyethylene glycol 27 anti–tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 diabody."", 'PSMA-Targeted Nanotheranostics for Imaging and Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Nanoparticle-Based Radioconjugates for Targeted Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Protein Binding Nanoparticles as an Integrated Platform for Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment.', 'Radiolabeled nanomaterials for biomedical applications: radiopharmacy in the era of nanotechnology.', 'PSMA-Targeting Imaging and Theranostic Agents-Current Status and Future Perspective.']"""

Materials and methods:   Forty-three bone marrow biopsies from 33 metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients with multiparametric MRI and documented bone metastases were evaluated. A second cohort included 10 CRPC patients with no bone metastases. Associations of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), normalized b900 diffusion-weighted imaging (nDWI) signal, and signal-weighted fat fraction (swFF) with bone marrow biopsy histological parameters were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlations. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were analyzed.  Results:   Median ADC and nDWI signal was significantly higher, and median swFF was significantly lower, in bone metastases than nonmetastatic bone (P < 0.001). In the metastatic cohort, 31 (72.1%) of 43 biopsies had detectable cancer cells. Median ADC and swFF were significantly lower and median nDWI signal was significantly higher in biopsies with tumor cells versus nondetectable tumor cells (898 × 10 mm/s vs 1617 × 10 mm/s; 11.5% vs 62%; 5.3 vs 2.3, respectively; P < 0.001). Tumor cellularity inversely correlated with ADC and swFF, and positively correlated with nDWI signal (P < 0.001). In serial biopsies, taken before and after treatment, changes in multiparametric MRI parameters paralleled histological changes.  Conclusions:   Multiparametric MRI provides valuable information about mCRPC bone metastases.

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the data from 71 eligible Chinese patients who received docetaxel chemotherapy from 2009 to 2016 in our hospital and experienced a reduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≥50% during the treatment and investigated the potential role of time to nadir (TTN) of PSA. TTN was defined as the time from start of chemotherapy to the nadir of PSA level during the treatment. Multivariable Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to predict overall survival (OS). In these patients, the median of TTN was 17 weeks. Patients with TTN ≥17 weeks had a longer response time to chemotherapy compared to TTN <17 weeks (42.83 vs 21.50 weeks, P < 0.001). The time to PSA progression in patients with TTN ≥17 weeks was 11.44 weeks compared to 5.63 weeks when TTN was <17 weeks. We found several factors to be associated with OS, including TTN (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.937, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.502-10.309, P = 0.005), PSA level at the diagnosis of cancer (HR: 4.337, 95% CI: 1.616-11.645, P = 0.004), duration of initial androgen deprivation therapy (HR: 2.982, 95% CI: 1.104-8.045, P = 0.031), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (HR: 3.963, 95% CI: 1.380-11.384, P = 0.011), and total PSA response (Class 1 [<0 response] compared to Class 2 [0-50% response], HR: 3.978, 95% CI: 1.278-12.387, P = 0.017).

The 10-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) rate for stage T3a and T3b was 96% and 91%, respectively (P = 0.0305). Although grade groups ≥4 were independent predictors for BCR in cT3a patients (P = 0.0270), they failed to significantly predict prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) among cT3a patients. Among cT3b patients, grade group 5 was a significant predictor of both BCR (P = 0.0017) and PCSM (P = 0.0233). Among stage T3a patients, no significant difference existed in 10-year CSS between grade groups 5 and 4 (94% vs 97%, P = 0.3960). In contrast, grade group 5 had a significantly worse outcome in 10-year CSS than grade group 4 among stage T3b patients (74% vs 100%, P = 0.0350).  Conclusions:   Stage T3a patients with grade groups 4/5 and stage T3b with grade group 4 had fairly low PCSM risk. Approximately one of four patients among stage T3b patients with grade group 5 showed PCSM after combined HDR-BT and EBRT with long-term ADT.

The underlying mechanisms responsible for neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) are yet to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in NEPCa.  Methods:   We utilized a gain-of-function analysis by establishing a human PCa LNCaP stable line that expresses hyperactive mTOR (LNCaP-mTOR). Then, we employed a comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis to identify a key transcription factor in LNCaP-mTOR, followed by a loss-of-function analysis using CRISPR/Cas system.  Results:   The activation of mTOR induced NED. We observed significant cell growth arrest in NED of LNCaP-mTOR, which accompanied increased expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 . A comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis identified interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) as a key transcription factor in growth arrest of LNCaP-mTOR. The disruption of IRF1 gene in LNCaP-mTOR reversed cell growth arrest along with the suppression of its target p21WAF1/CIP1 . These results indicate that the growth arrest in NED is at least in part dependent on IRF1 through the induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 .

Somatostatin (SST) and its five receptors (sst1-5 encoded by SSTR1-5 genes) comprise a pleiotropic system present in most endocrine-related cancers, some of which are successfully treated with SST analogs. Interestingly, it has been reported that SSTR1 is overexpressed in PCa, but its regulation, functional role, and clinical implications are still poorly known.  Methods:   PCa specimens (n = 52) from biopsies and control prostates from cystoprostatectomies (n = 12), as well as in silico databases were used to evaluate SSTR1 and miRNAs expression. In vitro studies in 22Rv1 PCa cells were implemented to explore the regulation of SSTR1/sst1 by different miRNAs, and to evaluate the consequences of SSTR1/sst1 overexpression, silencing and/or activation [with the specific BIM-23926 sst1 agonist (IPSEN)] on cell-proliferation, migration, signaling-pathways, and androgen-signaling.  Results:   We found that SSTR1 is overexpressed in multiple cohorts of PCa samples, as compared with normal prostate tissues, wherein it correlates with androgen receptor (AR) expression, and appears to be associated with aggressiveness (metastasis). Furthermore, our data revealed that SSTR1/sst1 expression might be regulated by specific miRNAs in PCa, including miR-24, which is downregulated in PCa samples and correlates inversely with SSTR1 expression. In vitro studies indicated that treatment with the BIM-23926 sst1 agonist, as well as SSTR1 overexpression, decreased, whereas SSTR1 silencing increased, cell-proliferation in 22Rv1 cells, likely through the regulation of PI3K/AKT-CCND3 signaling-pathway. Importantly, sst1 action was also able to modulate androgen/AR activity, and reduced PSA secretion from PCa cell lines.  Conclusions:   Altogether, our results indicate that SSTR1 is overexpressed in PCa, where it can exert a relevant pathophysiological role by decreasing cell-proliferation and PSA secretion. Therefore, sst1, possibly in combination with miR-24, could be used as a novel tool to explore therapeutic targets in PCa.""","""['Sergio Pedraza-Arévalo', 'Daniel Hormaechea-Agulla', 'Enrique Gómez-Gómez', 'María J Requena', 'Luke A Selth', 'Manuel D Gahete', 'Justo P Castaño', 'Raul M Luque']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Somatostatin, Cortistatin and Their Receptors Exert Antitumor Actions in Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells: Critical Role of Endogenous Cortistatin.', 'The oncogenic role of the In1-ghrelin splicing variant in prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'The oncogenic role of the spliced somatostatin receptor sst5TMD4 variant in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Somatostatin and its receptor family.', 'Iroquois Family Genes in Gastric Carcinogenesis: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Somatostatin, Cortistatin and Their Receptors Exert Antitumor Actions in Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells: Critical Role of Endogenous Cortistatin.', 'RNA-seq and Network Analysis Reveal Unique Chemokine Activity Signatures in the Synovial Tissue of Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'A Unified Transcriptional, Pharmacogenomic, and Gene Dependency Approach to Decipher the Biology, Diagnostic Markers, and Therapeutic Targets Associated with Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'Molecular and Clinical Implications of Somatostatin Receptor Profile and Somatostatin Analogues Treatment in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma.']"""

We evaluated whether a positive prostate cancer family history is associated with the prognosis and features of the disease.  Methods:   From January 2006 to December 2015, patients who received treatment for pathologically diagnosed prostate cancer were enrolled. Information on family history was obtained via self-administered questionnaires between January 2015 and December 2016. The overall survival rate for all patients and the rate of biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy were assessed according to the presence of family history.  Results:   Of 1266 patients (median age, 68.1 years; median prostate-specific antigen, 8.73 ng/mL; median follow-up, 40.0 months), 47 (3.8%) were identified as having a family history. Men with a family history had a younger age, higher proportion of cases diagnosed before 55 years of age, and lower stage than those without a family history. Family history was not a potential risk factor for overall survival. In an analysis of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (median prostate-specific antigen, 7.40 ng/mL; median follow-up, 40.5 months), no differences in pathologic characteristics were found between patients with (n = 39, 93.5%) and without (n = 567, 6.4%) a family history.

Therefore, GCPII represents an important diagnostic marker of prostate cancer progression and a putative target for the treatment of both prostate cancer and neuronal disorders associated with glutamate excitotoxicity. For the development of novel therapeutics, mouse models are widely used. However, although mouse GCPII activity has been characterized, a detailed comparison of the enzymatic activity and tissue distribution of the mouse and human GCPII orthologs remains lacking. In this study, we prepared extracellular mouse GCPII and compared it with human GCPII. We found that mouse GCPII possesses lower catalytic efficiency but similar substrate specificity compared with the human protein. Using a panel of GCPII inhibitors, we discovered that inhibition constants are generally similar for mouse and human GCPII. Furthermore, we observed highest expression of GCPII protein in the mouse kidney, brain, and salivary glands. Importantly, we did not detect GCPII in the mouse prostate. Our data suggest that the differences in enzymatic activity and inhibition profile are rather small; therefore, mouse GCPII can approximate human GCPII in drug development and testing.

A qualitative study of how affect influences cancer screening decisions""","""Background:   The belief that early detection is the best protection against cancer underlies cancer screening. Emerging research now suggests harms associated with early detection may sometimes outweigh the benefits. Governments, cancer agencies, and organizations that publish screening guidelines have found it is difficult to ""un-ring the bell"" on the message that ""early detection is your best protection"" because of its widespread communication and enduring resonance. This study explores affective factors-and their interplay with relevant analytical factors-in public/laypersons' decision making about cancer screening.  Methods:   A total of 93 people (47 men, 46 women) attended focus groups about, respectively, prostate cancer screening and breast cancer screening in two Canadian cities.  Results:   Affective factors were a major influence on many focus group participants' decision making about cancer screening, including fear of cancer and a generalized enthusiasm for prevention/screening, and they were often inspired by anecdotes about the cancer experiences of family and friends. Affect also existed alongside more analytical factors including assessments of reduced risk in the management of any cancer diagnosis if caught early, and, for men, the belief that an unreliable test is ""better than nothing,"" and that men deserve prostate cancer screening because women have breast and cervical cancer screening. Affective factors were particularly noticeable in the sub-groups most supportive of screening and the ""early detection"" message: older women who felt that mammogram screening should begin at age 40 rather than 50, and older men who felt that prostate cancer screening should be expanded beyond its current unorganized, opportunistic usage. In contrast, younger participants displayed less affective attachments to ""early detection"" messages and had greater concerns about harms of screening and were more receptive to nuanced messages informed by evidence.  Conclusion:   Policymakers attempting to communicate more nuanced versions of the ""early detection"" message need to understand the role of affect alongside other judgments brought into laypersons' decision making processes and anticipate how affective responses to their messages will be shaped, transformed, and potentially subverted by external forces beyond their control. Particularly overt external factors are campaigns by cancer advocacy organizations actively promoting breast and prostate cancer awareness and screening to younger women and men using affectively-charged messages.""","""['S Michelle Driedger', 'Gary Annable', 'Melissa Brouwers', 'Donna Turner', 'Ryan Maier']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Screening for prostate cancer: a guidance statement from the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians.', 'Uninformed compliance or informed choice?

Methods:   A retrospective, hospital-based cohort of 115,208 men with low-risk prostate cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 was used. Multivariate and mixed effects models were used to examine variation and factors associated with active surveillance.  Results:   During the study period, the use of active surveillance increased from 6.8% in 2010 to 19.9% in 2014 (estimated annual percentage change, +28.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], + 19.6% to + 38.7%; P = .002). The adjusted probability of active-surveillance receipt by institution was highly variable. Compared with patients treated at comprehensive community cancer centers, patients treated at community cancer programs (odds ratio [OR], 2.00; 95% CI, 1.50-2.67; P < .001) and academic institutions (OR, 2.47; 95%, CI, 1.81-3.37; P < .001) had higher odds of receiving active surveillance.

The quercetin analogues were synthesized and their binding to Bcl-xL was verified with fluorescence spectroscopy. The binding affinity and the thermodynamic parameters between Bcl-xL and quercetin-glutamic acid were estimated through Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. 2D 1H-15N HSQC NMR chemical shift perturbation mapping was used to chart the binding site of the quercetin analogues in the Bcl-xL that overlapped with the predicted poses generated by both IFD and MD calculations.

Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2 has been addressed, but few studies have reported the value of PI-RADS v2 for assessing risk stratification in patients with PCa, especially on selecting potential candidates for AS.  Purpose:   To investigate the utility of PI-RADS v2 and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in evaluating patients with insignificant PCa, who are suitable for AS.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Subjects:   In all, 238 patients with PCa who met the Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance criteria underwent radical prostatectomy.  Field strength/sequence:   3.0T, including T2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging.  Assessment:   Insignificant cancer was defined histopathologically as an organ-confined disease with a tumor volume <0.5 cm3 without Gleason score 4-5. Patients were divided into two groups based on the PI-RADS v2 and tumor ADC: A, PI-RADS score ≤3 and ADC ≥1.095 × 10-3 mm2 /s; and B, PI-RADS score 4-5 or ADC <1.095 × 10-3 mm2 /s. Preoperative clinical and imaging variables were evaluated regarding the associations with insignificant cancer.  Results:   Of the 238 patients, 101 (42.8%) were diagnosed with insignificant cancer on pathological findings. The number of positive cores, prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), PI-RADS v2 and tumor ADC were significantly associated with insignificant cancer on univariate analysis (P < 0.05). However, multivariate analysis indicated tumor ADC (odds ratio [OR] = 4.57, P < 0.001) and PI-RADS v2 (OR = 3.60, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of insignificant cancer. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) reached 0.803 when PI-RADS v2 (AUC = 0.747) was combined with tumor ADC (AUC = 0.786).  Data conclusion:   The PI-RADS v2 together with tumor ADC may be a useful marker for predicting patients with insignificant PCa when considering AS.

However, outgrowth of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) can occur due to the expression of constitutively active (ligand-independent) AR splice variants, particularly AR-V7. We previously demonstrated that sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate phytochemical, can decrease AR-FL levels in the PCa cell lines, LNCaP and C4-2B. Here, we examined the efficacy of SFN in targeting both AR-FL and AR-V7 in the CRPC cell line, CWR22Rv1 (22Rv1). MTT cell viability, wound-heal assay, and colony forming unit (CFU) measurements revealed that 22Rv1 cells are resistant to the anti-androgen, enzalutamide (ENZ). However, co-exposure to SFN sensitized these cells to the potent anticancer effects of ENZ (P<0.05). Immunoblot analyses showed that SFN (5-20 µM) rapidly decreases both AR-FL and AR-V7 levels, and immunofluorescence microscopy (IFM) depicted decreased AR in both cytoplasm and nucleus with SFN treatment. SFN increased both ubiquitination and proteasomal activity in 22Rv1 cells. Studies using a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide) or a proteasomal inhibitor (MG132) indicated that SFN increases both ubiquitin-mediated aggregation and subsequent proteasomal-degradation of AR proteins. Previous studies reported that SFN inhibits the chaperone activity of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and induces the nuclear factor erythroid-2-like 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor. Therefore, we investigated whether the Hsp90 inhibitor, ganetespib (G) or the Nrf2 activator, bardoxolone methyl (BM) can similarly suppress AR levels in 22Rv1 cells. Low doses of G and BM, alone or in combination, decreased both AR-FL and AR-V7 levels, and combined exposure to G+BM sensitized 22Rv1 cells to ENZ. Therefore, adjunct treatment with the phytochemical SFN or a safe pharmaceutical combination of G+BM may be effective against CRPC cells, especially those expressing AR-V7.""","""['Namrata Khurana', 'Hogyoung Kim', 'Partha K Chandra', 'Sudha Talwar', 'Pankaj Sharma', 'Asim B Abdel-Mageed', 'Suresh C Sikka', 'Debasis Mondal']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Sulforaphane increases the efficacy of anti-androgens by rapidly decreasing androgen receptor levels in prostate cancer cells.', 'Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Splice variant AR-V7 : Is it time for its routine use as a predictive marker in prostate cancer?.', 'Targeting PHB1 to inhibit castration-resistant prostate cancer progression in vitro and in vivo.', 'The crosstalk between ubiquitination and endocrine therapy.', 'Hybrid Androgen Receptor Inhibitors Outperform Enzalutamide and EPI-001 in in\u2005vitro Models of Prostate Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'Synergistic effects of natural products in combination with anticancer agents in prostate cancer: A scoping review.']"""

We found that prolonged androgen ablation increased the LNCaP-AI cell growth rate and cell invasiveness, and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the LNCaP-AI cells. Moreover, despite the fact that the LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cells expressed equal amounts of AR protein, androgen induced a greater secretion of PSA in the LNCaP-AI cells than in the LNCaP cells. The proliferation of the LNCaP-AI cells was not dependent on, but was suppressed by androgen, which led to arrest at the G1 phase. Conversely, androgen significantly increased LNCaP cell proliferation by promoting the G1-S transition. Moreover, the silencing of AR suppressed LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase rather than promoting apoptosis, and reduced PSA secretion. On the whole, our data suggest that LNCaP-AI cells have a more more aggressive phenotype compared with the LNCaP cells; AR remains a critical factor in the LNCaP-AI cells, and androgen suppresses LNCaP-AI cell growth by blocking the cell cycle at the G1 phase.""","""['Pan Yu', 'Xiuzhi Duan', 'Yue Cheng', 'Chunhua Liu', 'Yuhua Chen', 'Weiwei Liu', 'Binbin Yin', 'Xuchu Wang', 'Zhihua Tao']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of lysine-specific demethylase 1 promotes androgen-independent transition of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells through activation of the AR signaling pathway and suppression of the p53 signaling pathway.', 'Activation of p53 signaling and inhibition of androgen receptor mediate tanshinone IIA induced G1 arrest in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'Identification and Validation of Three Hub Genes Involved in Cell Proliferation and Prognosis of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'PDZRN4 suppresses tumorigenesis and androgen therapy-resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Loading of ""cocktail siRNAs"" into extracellular vesicles via TAT-DRBD peptide for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Clinical response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) cases treated with supra-physiological doses of testosterone: Bipolar androgen therapy.']"""

Methods:   A total of 109 consecutive patients (median age 71 years; range 48-89 years) who had PSA recurrence after RP and/or hormonotherapy and/or radiotherapy were included in this study. Local recurrences, lymph node metastasis (pelvic, abdominal and/or supradiaphragmatic), bone metastases (oligometastatic/multimetastatic) and other metastatic sites (lung, liver, brain, etc) were documented.  Results:   In 91(83.4%) patients at least one lesion characteristic for PCa was detected by68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. The median serum total PSA (tPSA) was 6.5 (0.2-640) ng/ml.There was a significant difference between 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT positive and negative patients in terms of serum total PSA value. No statistical significance was found between positive and negative 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings in terms of Gleason score.

Our aim was to assess the adequacy of the tools currently used to assess bowel symptoms after radiotherapy, including physician and patient reported outcomes. This sub-study on acute toxicity was part of a prospective trial assessing long-term bowel dysfunction.  Materials and methods:   Between February 2013 and July 2015, 75 patients with prostate cancer who received radiotherapy completed the LENT/SOMA and the EPIC questionnaires baseline and 2 weeks after the treatment. The Bristol stool scale and two additional questions on faecal urgency were added. Physicians assessed toxicity using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0. Agreement between patients and clinicians was assessed using the Cohen's κ coefficient.  Results:   Acute toxicity during radiotherapy was very low. The pattern of overall bowel bother was similar before and after treatment. Faecal urgency significantly increased after radiotherapy compared to baseline but was only detected by the additional questions and not by the physicians or the patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaires. Correlation between physician and PRO was poor for most symptoms.  Conclusion:   Bowel symptoms such as urgency may remain undetected by usual tools to assess toxicity after radiotherapy. Assessment of bowel toxicity should be reappraised in order to identify those patients who may have symptoms with an impact on their quality of life.""","""['M Bonet', 'L Cayetano', 'M Núñez', 'E Jovell-Fernández', 'A Aguilar', 'Y Ribas']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Scoring of treatment-related late effects in prostate cancer.', 'Single-fraction high-dose-rate brachytherapy and hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer: analysis of short- and medium-term toxicity and quality of life.', 'Predictors of grade 3 or higher late bowel toxicity in patients undergoing pelvic radiation for cervical cancer: results from a prospective study.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy as primary treatment for prostate cancer: acute toxicity in 114 patients.', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Bowel dysfunction in survivors of gynaecologic malignancies.', 'Effects of a nutrition intervention on acute and late bowel symptoms and health-related quality of life up to 24 months post radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer: a multicentre randomised controlled trial.', 'Patient- versus physician-reported outcomes in prostate cancer patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy within a\xa0randomized controlled trial.']"""

Our data demonstrated that GluOC suppressed cell growth by downregulating phosphorylation levels of receptor tyrosine kinases and inducing apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, stimulation of primary mouse splenocytes with concanavalin A, a polyclonal T-cell mitogen, in the presence of GluOC increased T cell proliferation and their interferon-γ production.

Natural antibodies are those antibodies present without known history of infection or immunization, and react to a wide range of targets, including ""cryptic"" self-antigens that are exposed upon cell death. In this study, the ability of immunization to elicit the production of natural antibodies in laboratory rats was evaluated. Laboratory rats were immunized with a series of injections using peanut extracts (a common allergen), a high molecular weight protein conjugated to hapten (FITC-KLH), and a carbohydrate conjugated to hapten (DNP-Ficall). Significantly greater binding of antibodies from immunized animals compared to controls was observed to numerous autologous organ extracts (brain, kidney, liver, lung, prostate, and spleen) for both IgM and IgG, although the effect was more pronounced for IgM. These studies suggest that immunization may have at least one unforeseen benefit, enhancing networks of natural antibodies that may be important in such processes as wound repair and tumor surveillance. Such enhancement of natural antibody function may be particularly important in Western society, where decreased exposure to the environment may be associated with a weakened natural antibody repertoire.""","""['Dylan Beinart', 'Daniel Ren', 'Cinthia Pi', 'Susan Poulton', 'Zoie E Holzknecht', 'Chelsea Swanson', 'William Parker']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""EXCLI J""","""['Active immunization of human ovarian cancer patients against a common carcinoma (Thomsen-Friedenreich) determinant using a synthetic carbohydrate antigen.', 'Constructing an adenocarcinoma vaccine: immunization of mice with synthetic KH-1 nonasaccharide stimulates anti-KH-1 and anti-Le(y) antibodies.', 'Mucosal memory B cells retain the ability to produce IgM antibodies 2 years after oral immunization.', 'Cell activation and immunogenicity.', 'Natural antibodies and the host immune responses to xenografts.', 'Complexity of the Immune Response Elicited by Different COVID-19 Vaccines, in the Light of Natural Autoantibodies and Immunomodulatory Therapies.', ""Authors' response to Graham Rook's commentary."", 'Current Understanding of Natural Antibodies and Exploring the Possibilities of Modulation Using Veterinary Models.

Aggressive prostate cancer, defined by the progression from localized disease to metastasis, is responsible for the majority of prostate cancer-associated mortality. Recent gene expression profiling has proven successful in predicting the outcome of prostate cancer patients; however, they have yet to provide targeted therapy approaches that could inhibit a patient's progression to metastatic disease.Experimental Design: We have interrogated a total of seven primary prostate cancer cohorts (n = 1,900), two metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer datasets (n = 293), and one prospective cohort (n = 1,385) to assess the impact of TOP2A and EZH2 expression on prostate cancer cellular program and patient outcomes. We also performed IHC staining for TOP2A and EZH2 in a cohort of primary prostate cancer patients (n = 89) with known outcome. Finally, we explored the therapeutic potential of a combination therapy targeting both TOP2A and EZH2 using novel prostate cancer-derived murine cell lines.Results: We demonstrate by genome-wide analysis of independent primary and metastatic prostate cancer datasets that concurrent TOP2A and EZH2 mRNA and protein upregulation selected for a subgroup of primary and metastatic patients with more aggressive disease and notable overlap of genes involved in mitotic regulation. Importantly, TOP2A and EZH2 in prostate cancer cells act as key driving oncogenes, a fact highlighted by sensitivity to combination-targeted therapy.Conclusions: Overall, our data support further assessment of TOP2A and EZH2 as biomarkers for early identification of patients with increased metastatic potential that may benefit from adjuvant or neoadjuvant targeted therapy approaches.

Methods:   Cell aggregate rheological properties were analyzed during dynamic compression stress performed on a homemade rheometer. Single cell visco-elasticity measurements were performed by Atomic Force Microscopy using a cantilever with round tip on surface-attached cells. At a molecular level, the lateral diffusion coefficient of total extracted lipids deposited as a Langmuir monolayer on an air-water interface was measured by the FRAP technique.  Results:   At cellular pellet scale, and at single cell scale, PC-3 cells were less stiff, less viscous, and thus more prone to deformation than the WPMY-1 control. Interestingly, stress-relaxation curves indicated a two-step response, which we attributed to a differential response coming from two cell elements, successively stressed. Both responses are faster for PC-3 cells. At a molecular scale, the dynamics of the PC-3 lipid extracts are also faster than that of WPMY-1 lipid extracts.  Conclusions:   As the evolution of cancer towards increasingly aggressive stages is accompanied by alterations both in membrane composition and in cytoskeleton dynamical properties, we attribute differences in viscoelasticity between PC-3 and WPMY-1 cells to modifications of both elements.

In this study, we report that PAQR3 is able to inhibit the growth and migration of human prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of PAQR3 inhibits the proliferation of PC3 and DU145 cells by both MTT and colony formation assays. Consistently, knockdown of PAQR3 enhances the proliferation of these cells. In wound-healing and transwell assays, overexpression of PAQR3 reduces the migration of PC3 and DU145 cells, while PAQR3 knockdown increases it. In a tumor xenograft model, overexpression of PAQR3 suppresses tumor growth of PC3 cells in vivo, while PAQR3 knockdown promotes the tumor growth. PAQR3 is also able to inhibit serum-induced phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in both PC3 and DU145 cells. In addition, PAQR3 suppresses the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in PC3 cells. Collectively, these data indicate that PAQR3 has a tumor suppressive activity in human prostate cancer cells and may stand out as a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancers.""","""['Wenqiang Huang#', 'Weiwei Guo#', 'Xue You', 'Yi Pan', 'Zhenyang Dong', 'Gaozhen Jia', 'Chenghua Yang', 'Yan Chen']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Characterization of the Golgi scaffold protein PAQR3, and its role in tumor suppression and metabolic pathway compartmentalization.', 'PAQR3 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion in human glioma cells.', 'P21 activated kinase-1 mediates transforming growth factor β1-induced prostate cancer cell epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'PAQR3 expression is downregulated in human breast cancers and correlated with HER2 expression.', 'PAQR3: a novel tumor suppressor gene.', 'Golgi Complex: A Signaling Hub in Cancer.', 'CdGAP promotes prostate cancer metastasis by regulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis.', 'Characterization of the Golgi scaffold protein PAQR3, and its role in tumor suppression and metabolic pathway compartmentalization.', 'PAQR3 suppresses the growth of non-small cell lung cancer cells via modulation of EGFR-mediated autophagy.', 'PAQR3 inhibits proliferation via suppressing PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

Methods:   All patients undergoing an RARP between 2004 and October 2016 while under the care of six high-volume surgeons were included in this study. Data were collected prospectively regarding patient demographics and clinical details of their cancer.  Results:   Over the 12-year time span of the study, 3075 men underwent an RARP with a median age of 63.01 years. Temporal analysis demonstrated that the median age of patients undergoing prostatectomy advanced with time with the median age in 2016 being 65.51 years compared with 61.0 years in 2004 (P < 0.001). There was also a significant trend to increased D'Amico risk groups over time with the percentage procedures for high-risk patients increasing from 12.6% to 28.10% from 2004 to 2016 (P < 0.001). Upgrade rates between biopsy and pathological Gleason grade scoring significantly trended down over the period of the study (P < 0.001). There was also a shift to increased pathological stage over the 12 years with 22.1% of men having T3 disease in 2004 compared with 49.8% in 2016.

Correlation of the rate of detection of metastatic disease by Ga-PSMA-I&T PET/CT with the Gleason score (GS) and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was performed to determine the GS and PSA criteria defining patients who would benefit from Ga-PSMA-I&T PET/CT imaging for staging, risk stratification and therapy optimization.  Patients and methods:   Patient data and images from 70 patients with a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer who had undergone Ga-PSMA-I&T PET/CT were analysed retrospectively. Data and images were analysed for the rate of detection of primary and metastatic PCa, and correlation with PSA and GS.  Results:   The rate of detection of primary tumour by Ga-PSMA-I&T for patients with serum PSA less than 5 ng/ml was 73%. The corresponding rate was 90% for patients with PSA 5-10 ng/ml and 97% for patients with PSA more than 10 ng/ml. Metastatic PCa and/or infiltrative disease was detected in 24/70 study patients in total: 1/11 patients with PSA less than 5 ng/ml and 23/59 patients with serum PSA at least 5 ng/ml. The rate of detection of metastatic PCa was greater in patients with GS 9 or more (48%) relative to those with GS 8 (32%) or GS ≤7 (18%).  Conclusion:   A role for Ga-PSMA-I&T PET/CT in primary PCa staging of high-grade disease (GS 8 or more and PSA >10 ng/ml) has been shown.

Dietary protein restriction (PR) increases insulin sensitivity and suppresses prostate cancer cell tumor growth in animal models, providing a rationale for clinical trials. We sought to demonstrate that biomarkers derived from plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) reflect systemic leptin and insulin signaling and respond to dietary interventions. We studied plasma samples from men with prostate cancer awaiting prostatectomy who participated in a randomized trial of one month of PR or control diet. We found increased levels of leptin receptor in the PR group in total plasma EVs and in a subpopulation of plasma EVs expressing the neuronal marker L1CAM. Protein restriction also shifted the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor signal transducer protein IRS1 in L1CAM+ EVs in a manner suggestive of improved insulin sensitivity. Dietary PR modifies indicators of leptin and insulin signaling in circulating EVs.

In 2008, a population-based cancer registry was set up for the monitoring of cancer incidence in the aftermath of the environmental pollution with chlordecone, a persistent organochlorine insecticide formerly used in banana plantations. We describe the clinical presentation, incidence, mortality and survival of prostate cancer for the period 2008-2013.  Methods:   The Guadeloupe cancer registry has been routinely collecting all incident cases of cancer since 2008. We compared age-specific incidence rates between different populations, and calculated incidence and mortality rates standardized to the world population. Kaplan-Meier observed survival and estimated age-standardized net survival were calculated by category for age, PSA level, and Gleason score using the Pohar-Perme method.  Results:   Overall, 3,295 cases of prostate cancer were recorded. World-standardized incidence and mortality were respectively 184.1 [177.8-190.4] and 23.9 [21.9-25.7] per 100,000 person-years. At diagnosis, the mean age of patients was 68 ± 9.6 years old and 22% were aged over 75. Median PSA level was 8.9 [IQR: 6.0-16.0] and 13.6% of the patients had a Gleason ≥ 8. Five-year observed and net survivals were, respectively, 79.6% [77.9-81.2] and 90.7% [88.6-92.8].  Conclusion:   The incidence of prostate cancer in Guadeloupe is among the highest in the world, along with those of the neighboring Caribbean countries and US African-Americans.

In the present study, with the aim of reducing the cost of utilizing growth factors in cancer research, a simple and efficient method for the preparation of recombinant human (rh)FGF9 in Escherichia coli was established. The rhFGF9 fusion protein (6 × His-TEV-rhFGF9) and the native protein released by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease were obtained using a Ni-NTA system, with > 95% purity. Both purified forms of rhFGF9, with and without fusion tags, significantly stimulated the proliferation of NIH3T3 cells. The FGF9 subfamily, including FGF9, FGF16, and FGF20, in addition to rhFGF16, rhFGF9, and rhFGF20, were shown to stimulate the proliferation and migration of HuH7 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that the stimulation of HuH7 cell proliferation and migration with rhFGF9 and rhFGF20 were associated with the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways and matrix metalloproteinase-26 (MMP26). Inhibition of the ERK and NF-κB pathways blocked cell migration, and NF-κB was demonstrated to be regulated by ERK. Therefore, the present study demonstrates a simple method for the preparation of biologically active rhFGF9 protein. Furthermore, the results indicate that exogenous rhFGF9- and rhFGF20-activated ERK/NF-κB signal transduction pathways play important roles in the regulation of HCC cell proliferation and migration, and this discovery helps to find the potential for new solutions of the treatment of liver cancer.""","""['Shen Wang', 'Haipeng Lin', 'Tiantian Zhao', 'Sisi Huang', 'David G Fernig', 'Nuo Xu', 'Fenfang Wu', 'Mi Zhou', 'Chao Jiang', 'Haishan Tian']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Appl Microbiol Biotechnol""","""['Expression of bioactive recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 9 in oil bodies of Arabidopsis thaliana.', 'Oil body bound oleosin-rhFGF9 fusion protein expressed in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) stimulates hair growth and wound healing in mice.', 'Up-regulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 9 expression and FGF-WNT/β-catenin signaling in laser-induced wound healing.', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 9 is expressed by activated hepatic stellate cells and promotes progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Fibroblast growth factor 9 subfamily and the heart.', ""A method for the expression of fibroblast growth factor 14 and assessment of its neuroprotective effect in an Alzheimer's disease model."", 'Production of bioactive recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 12 using a new transient expression vector in E. coli and its neuroprotective effects.', 'Identification of a 14-Gene Prognostic Signature for Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).', 'Downregulation of miR-499a-5p Predicts a Poor Prognosis of Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Restrains the Tumorigenesis by Targeting Fibroblast Growth Factor 9.', 'MicroRNA-431 serves as a tumor inhibitor in breast cancer through targeting FGF9.']"""

Chemotherapy, such as docetaxel (DTX), can enhance the efficacy of RT. Multidrug resistance mechanisms often limit drug efficacy by decreasing intracellular concentrations of drugs in tumor cells. It is, therefore, of interest to develop nanocarriers of DTX to maintain the drug inside cancer cells and thus improve treatment efficacy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of titanate nanotubes (TiONts) to develop a TiONts-DTX nanocarrier and to evaluate its radiosensitizing in vivo efficacy in a prostate cancer model. In vitro cytotoxic activity of TiONts-DTX was evaluated using an MTS assay. The biodistribution of TiONts-DTX was analyzed in vivo by single-photon emission computed tomography. The benefit of TiONts-DTX associated with RT was evaluated in vivo. Eight groups with seven mice in each were used to evaluate the efficacy of the nanohybrid combined with RT: control with buffer IT injection ± RT, free DXL ± RT, TiONts ± RT and TiONts-DXL ± RT. Mouse behavior, health status and tumor volume were monitored twice a week until the tumor volume reached a maximum of 2,000 mm3. More than 70% of nanohybrids were localized inside the tumor 96 h after administration. Tumor growth was significantly slowed by TiONts-DTX associated with RT, compared with free DTX in the same conditions (P=0.013). These results suggest that TiONts-DTX improved RT efficacy and might enhance local control in high-risk localized prostate cancer.""","""['Céline Mirjolet', 'Julien Boudon', 'Alexis Loiseau', 'Sandy Chevrier', 'Romain Boidot', 'Alexandra Oudot', 'Bertrand Collin', 'Etienne Martin', 'Pattayil Alias Joy', 'Nadine Millot', 'Gilles Créhange']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['About the Influence of PEG Spacers on the Cytotoxicity of Titanate Nanotubes-Docetaxel Nanohybrids against a Prostate Cancer Cell Line.', 'Titanate Nanotubes Engineered with Gold Nanoparticles and Docetaxel to Enhance Radiotherapy on Xenografted Prostate Tumors.', 'Taxane-Grafted Metal-Oxide Nanoparticles as a New Theranostic Tool against Cancer: The Promising Example of Docetaxel-Functionalized Titanate Nanotubes on Prostate Tumors.', 'Prostate cancer: multimodality approaches with docetaxel.', 'Radiosensitization in prostate cancer: mechanisms and targets.', 'Advanced nanomaterial for prostate cancer theranostics.', 'Radiation nanosensitizers in cancer therapy-From preclinical discoveries to the outcomes of early clinical trials.', 'About the Influence of PEG Spacers on the Cytotoxicity of Titanate Nanotubes-Docetaxel Nanohybrids against a Prostate Cancer Cell Line.', 'Bacterial Genotoxin-Coated Nanoparticles for Radiotherapy Sensitization in Prostate Cancer.', 'Titanate Nanotubes Engineered with Gold Nanoparticles and Docetaxel to Enhance Radiotherapy on Xenografted Prostate Tumors.']"""

This model simulates metastatic prostate cancer evolution, progressing from normal bone and hormone levels to quantifiable diseased states. The simulations clearly demonstrate phenomena similar to those found clinically in prostate cancer patients. In addition, the major prediction of this model is the existence of low and high osteogenic states that are markedly different from one another. The existence and potential realization of these steady states appear to be mediated by the Wnt signaling pathway and by the effects of PSA on TGF-β, which encourages the bone microenvironment to evolve. The model is used to explore several potential therapeutic strategies, with some potential drug targets showing more promise than others: in particular, completely blocking Wnt and greatly increasing DKK-1 had significant positive effects, while blocking RANKL did not improve the outcome.""","""['A Farhat', 'D Jiang', 'D Cui', 'E T Keller', 'T L Jackson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Math Biosci""","""['Bone microenvironment-targeted manipulations for the treatment of osteoblastic metastasis in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Predictive computational modeling to define effective treatment strategies for bone metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Tasquinimod inhibits prostate cancer growth in bone through alterations in the bone microenvironment.', 'An integrated computational model of the bone microenvironment in bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Agents targeting prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Mathematical modeling of the effects of Wnt-10b on bone metabolism.', 'Patient-specific forecasting of postradiotherapy prostate-specific antigen kinetics enables early prediction of biochemical relapse.', ""Toward a Mathematical Modeling of Diseases' Impact on Bone Remodeling: Technical Review."", 'Mechanistic modelling of prostate-specific antigen dynamics shows potential for personalized prediction of radiation therapy outcome.', 'Bone metastasis treatment modeling via optimal control.']"""

We conducted various predictive models using Cox regression and estimated (C-index) and compared their predictive capacity.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 71 months, the BRR and CSM of the patient group with Gleason 3+4 tumours and a low number (≤3) and percentage (≤33%) of positive cores were not significantly different from those of the patients with Gleason 6 tumours. At 5 and 10 years, there were no significant differences in the number of biochemical recurrences, the probability of remaining free of biochemical recurrences, the number of deaths by PC or the probability of death by PC between the 2 groups. In contrast, the patients with Gleason 3+4 tumours and more than 33% of positive cores presented more deaths by PC than the patients with Gleason 6 tumours. At 10 years, the probability of CSM was significantly greater. This subgroup of tumours showed a significantly greater BRR (RR, 1.6; P=.02) and CSM (RR, 5.8, P≤.01) compared with the Gleason 6 tumours. The model with Gleason 3+4 stratified by the percentage of positive cores significantly improved the predictive capacity of BRR and CSM.  Conclusions:   Fewer than 3 cores and a percentage <33% of positive cores identifies a subgroup of Gleason 3+4 tumours with biological behaviour similar to Gleason 6 tumours. At 10 years, there were no differences in BRR and CSM between the 2 groups. These results provide evidence supporting active surveillance as an alternative for Gleason 3+4 tumours and low tumour extension in biopsy.""","""['J L Ruiz-Cerdá', 'L Lorenzo Soriano', 'D Ramos-Soler', 'L Marzullo-Zucchet', 'A Loras Monfort', 'F Boronat Tormo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'The percentage of prostate needle biopsy cores with carcinoma from the more involved side of the biopsy as a predictor of prostate specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Active surveillance in prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer CD133+ stem cells (PCSCs) were isolated from human castration-resistant PC3 cells. PCSCs were treated with different concentrations of MDK inhibitor, iMDK, for 24-72 hours. The IC50 values were determined by the MTT test. Endogenous MDK messenger RNA expression was knocked down by small interfering RNA. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analyses and image-based cytometry were used to investigate apoptosis and cell cycle progression as well as their underlying molecular mechanisms. Cell migration was evaluated by the wound healing test.  Results:   iMDK caused dose- and time-dependent inhibition of PCSC survival. Similar growth inhibition was also obtained by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous MDK expression. iMDK was shown to preferentially induce cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases. Suppressed PCSC growth was also accompanied by increases in p53 and the cell cycle inhibitor p21 genes. Combinatorial treatment of iMDK with docetaxel significantly inhibited cell proliferation versus either of the agents used alone. Inhibition of MDK expression strongly suppressed the migration of PCSCs compared to untreated and docetaxel-treated cells. iMDK and the knockdown of MDK decreased p-Akt and significantly upregulated the expression of PI3K/phosphatase/tensin homolog.  Conclusions:   Our data indicate that MDK plays a crucial role in controlling PCSC proliferation and migration. Therefore, suppression of endogenous expression of MDK would, in combination with traditional chemotherapy drugs, be a potential treatment for PCSCs.""","""['Suat Erdogan', 'Zeynep B Doganlar', 'Oguzhan Doganlar', 'Kader Turkekul', 'Riza Serttas']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Am J Med Sci""","""['Inhibition of the growth factor MDK/midkine by a novel small molecule compound to treat non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Midkine downregulation increases the efficacy of quercetin on prostate cancer stem cell survival and migration through PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathway.', 'Midkine silencing enhances the anti-prostate cancer stem cell activity of the flavone apigenin: cooperation on signaling pathways regulated by ERK, p38, PTEN, PARP, and NF-κB.', 'Concise Review: Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Current Understanding.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells: advances in current research.', 'Targeting MDK Abrogates IFN-γ-Elicited Metastasis inCancers of Various Origins.', 'Multigene Profiling of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) for Prognostic Assessment in Treatment-Naïve Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC).', 'MicroRNA-188 inhibits biological activity of lung cancer stem cells through targeting MDK and mediating the Hippo pathway.', 'Sphere-Forming Culture for Expanding Genetically Distinct Patient-Derived Glioma Stem Cells by Cellular Growth Rate Screening.', 'Midkine-a Is Required for Cell Cycle Progression of Müller Glia during Neuronal Regeneration in the Vertebrate Retina.']"""

The use of variable RBE values has been suggested but is currently not feasible due to uncertainties. The impact of variable RBE has solely been studied using dosimetric indices. This work elucidates the impact of RBE variations on tumor control and normal tissue complication probabilities (TCP/NTCP).  Methods:   Models to estimate TCP and NTCP were used in combination with an empirical proton RBE model. Variations in outcome as a function of linear-quadratic model parameters for cellular radiosensitivity were determined for TCP in prostate and ependymoma. In addition, NTCP analysis was done for brainstem necrosis.  Results:   Considering a variable proton RBE as a dose-modifying factor for prescription doses and dose constraints is misleading, as TCP/NTCP do not simply scale with RBE. The dependency of RBE on α/β cannot be interpreted independent of TCP/NTCP because variations in radiosensitivity affect both photon and proton treatments. Assuming interpatient variability in radiosensitivity results in lower TCP for patients with low α/β. In proton therapy, the magnitude of TCP variations is reduced due to an RBE increase as α/β decreases. The TCP in proton therapy is less affected by interpatient variability in α/β. On the other hand, patients with a lower α/β would have a lower complication probability, which is counteracted by an increase in RBE as α/β decreases. Toxicities in proton therapy would be more affected by α/β variations compared to photon therapy.  Conclusions:   Assessment of variable RBE in proton therapy should be based on TCP and NTCP. Potential interpatient variability in radiosensitivity causes a smaller variance in TCP but a larger variance in NTCP for proton patients. The relative TCP as a function of α/β was found to be higher than the RBE, whereas the relative NTCP was lower than a calculated RBE.""","""['Harald Paganetti']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Applying a variable relative biological effectiveness (RBE) might affect the analysis of clinical trials comparing photon and proton therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of potentially variable RBE in liver proton therapy.', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness Uncertainties and Implications for Beam Arrangements and Dose Constraints in Proton Therapy.', 'Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values for proton beam therapy.

There are no proper guidelines to investigate the suspected prostate cancer in the Cayman Islands. We correlated PSA levels with the incidence of prostate cancers by tissue diagnosis and proposed logical protocol for prostate screening by using PSA test in this small population.  Materials and methods:   A total of 165 Afro Caribbean individuals who had prostate biopsy done after the investigations for PSA levels from year 2005 to 2015 were studied retrospectively. The patients were divided into subgroups by baseline PSA levels as follows: <4, 4.1-10, 10.1-20, 20.1-50, 50.1-100, and >100 ng/mL and were correlated to the age and presence of cancer.  Results and discussion:   Benign lesions had lower PSA levels compared to cancer which generally had higher values. Only three cases that had less than 4 ng/mg were turned out to be malignant. When PSA value was more than 100 ng/mL, all the cases were malignant. Between PSA values of 4-100 ng/mL, the probability of cancer diagnosis was 56.71% (76 cancers out of 134 in this range). Limitation of PSA testing has the risk of over diagnosis and the resultant negative biopsies owing to poor specificity. Whereas the cutoff limit for cancer diagnosis still remains 4 ng/mL from our study, most of the patients can be assured of benign lesion below this level and thus morbidity associated with the biopsy can be prevented. When the PSA value is greater than 100 ng, biopsy procedure was mandatory as there were 100% cancers above this level. On the background of vast literature linking PSA to prostate cancer and its difficulty in implementing in clinical practice, we studied literature of this conflicting and complex topic and tried to bring relevant protocols to the small population of Cayman Islands for the screening of prostate cancer. In this study, a total of 165 Afro Caribbean individuals who had prostate biopsy done after the investigations for PSA levels from year 2005 to 2015 were studied retrospectively. As a result of this research work, it can be concluded that a benign diagnosis can be given with a fair certainty when the PSA was below 4 ng/mL and a level of 100 ng/mL can be very unfavorable for the patients. This study helped to solidify the cancer screening protocols in Cayman Islands.  Conclusion:   The PSA level can reassure and educate the patients towards the diagnosis of cancer of prostate in Cayman Islands.

Methods/analysis:   A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial will be conducted. The PDA will be sequentially implemented in 18 hospitals in the Netherlands, over a period of 24 months. Every 3 or 6 months, a new cluster of hospitals will switch from usual care to care including a PDA.The primary outcome measure is decisional conflict experienced by the patient. Secondary outcomes comprise the patient's quality of life, treatment preferences, role in the decision making, expectations of treatment, knowledge, need for supportive care and decision regret. Furthermore, societal cost-utility will be valued. Other outcome measures considered are the partner's treatment preferences, experienced participation to decision making, quality of life, communication between patient, partner and health care professional, and the effect of prostate cancer on the relationship, social contacts and their role as caregiver. Patients and partners receiving the PDA will also be asked about their satisfaction with the PDA.Baseline assessment takes place after the treatment choice and before the start of a treatment, with follow-up assessments at 3, 6 and 12 months following the end of treatment or the day after deciding on active surveillance. Outcome measures on implementation include the implementation rate (defined as the proportion of all eligible patients who will receive a PDA) and a questionnaire for health care professionals on determinants of implementing an innovation.

Moreover, as they live in unhygienic conditions, they regularly come across pathogens. Logically, we postulate that crocodiles possess mechanisms to defend themselves from noxious agents as well as protecting themselves from pathogens. To test this hypothesis, various organ lysates and serum of Crocodylus palustris were prepared. Amoebicidal assays were performed using Acanthamoeba castellanii belonging to the T4 genotype. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using Prostate cancer cells culture by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release as a marker for cell death. Growth inhibition assays were performed to determine the growth inhibitory effects of various organ lysates. Serum and heart lysates of Crocodylus palustris exhibited powerful anti-tumor activity exhibiting more than 70% Prostate cancer cell death (P < 0.05). Additionally, lysates from gall bladder and bile also showed significant host cell cytotoxicity, however intestine, lungs and brain showed partial cytotoxicity. Both sera and heart lysates of Crocodylus palustris abolished Prostate cells growth. Moreover, serum completely abolished A. castellanii viability. For the first time, these findings showed that the organ lysates of Crocodylus palustris exhibit potent anti-amoebic and anti-tumor activity. The discovery of antimicrobial and antitumor activity in crocodile will stimulate research in finding therapeutic molecules from unusual sources, and has potential for the development of novel antitumor/antimicrobial compound(s) that may also overcome drug resistance.

Methods:   This retrospective study included 4758 consecutive patients who underwent abdomino-pelvic MDCT between January 2012 and December 2014 at Jordan University Hospital, Amman, Jordan. Radiological database was searched for MP diagnosis and patients with suspected MP were re-evaluated by an experienced radiologist to confirm the diagnosis. Data on all patients with confirmed MP diagnosis were subsequently collected and analyzed.  Results:   Computed tomography features of MP were identified in 90 patients (41 males, 49 females), a prevalence of 1.9%. Mesenteric panniculitis was identified in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Malignancy was found in 28 MP patients (31%) and 44 of the MP patients (49%) had prior history of abdomino-pelvic surgery. Mesenteric panniculitis was significantly more frequently associated with prior abdomino-pelvic surgery (p=0.0001) and the likelihood of associated malignancy in patients with MP was 2.1-fold higher than in patients without MP (p=0.0013). Conclusion: Mesenteric panniculitis can be reliably diagnosed by MDCT due to its typical CT appearance. Its identification is important because of its significant association with malignancy and because it represents one of the differential diagnoses in patients with nonspecific symptoms referred for abdomino-pelvic CT.""","""['Waleed S Mahafza', 'Karam A Manzalawi', 'Azza A Gharaibeh', 'Omar W Khayat', 'Awni Shahait', 'Malik E Juweid']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Saudi Med J""","""['Mesenteric Panniculitis (MP) in CT - A Predictor of Malignancy?', 'Clinical significance of mesenteric panniculitis-like abnormalities on abdominal computerized tomography in patients with malignant neoplasms.', 'Mesenteric panniculitis: review of consecutive abdominal MDCT examinations with a matched-pair analysis.', 'Mesenteric panniculitis: systematic review of cross-sectional imaging findings and risk of subsequent malignancy.', 'Mesenteric Panniculitis (MP): A Frequent Coincidental CT Finding of\xa0Debatable Clinical Significance.', 'A Single Tertiary Center 14-year Experience With Mesenteric Panniculitis in Turkey: A Retrospective Study of 716 Patients.', 'Acute Recurrent Exacerbations of Mesenteric Panniculitis With Immunosuppressive Therapy: A Case Report and a Brief Review.', 'Clinical and radiological features of mesenteric panniculitis: a critical overview.', 'The Complex Relationship between Mesenteric Panniculitis and Malignancy - A Holistic Approach is Still Needed to Understand the Diagnostic Uncertainties.', 'Relationship of mesenteric panniculitis with visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue.']"""

Materials and methods:   A decision-analytic Markov model was developed from the healthcare payer perspective to simulate the history of a 66-year-old man with low-risk PCa. The model followed patients yearly over their remaining lifetimes. Health states included 'recurrence-free', 'biochemical recurrence' (BR), 'metastatic' and 'death'. Transition probabilities were based on a retrospective cohort analysis undertaken at our institution. Utilities were derived from the literature. Costs were assigned in 2015 Canadian dollars ($) and reflected Ontario's health system and departmental costs. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY was used.  Results:   SBRT was the dominant strategy with 0.008LYs and 0.029QALYs gained and a reduction in cost of $2615. Under base case conditions, our results were sensitive to the BR probability associated with both strategies. LDR-BT becomes the preferred strategy if the BR with SBRT is 1.3*[baseline BR_SBRT] or if the BR with LDR-BT is 0.76*[baseline BR_LDR-BT]. When assuming the same BR for both strategies, LDR-BT becomes marginally more effective with 0.009QALYs gained at a cost of $272 848/QALY.

We performed 11C-choline positron emission tomography/computerized tomography and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.  Materials and methods:   After radiotherapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were evaluated by 11C-choline positron emission tomography/computerized tomography and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to determine recurrence patterns and clinicopathological features. Recurrent sites were described as local only (seminal vesicle bed/prostate fossa, vesicourethral anastomosis and bladder neck) or distant metastatic disease. Features associated with the identification of any distant metastatic disease were evaluated by multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   A total of 550 patients were identified. Treatment included androgen deprivation therapy in 108, radiotherapy in 201, and androgen deprivation therapy and radiotherapy in 241. Median prostate specific antigen at evaluation was 3.9, 3.6 and 2.8 ng/ml in patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy, radiotherapy and a combination, respectively. Recurrence developed locally in 77 patients (14%), as distant metastasis only in 411 (75%), and as local and distant metastatic disease in 62 (11%). On multivariable analysis treatment with radiotherapy (OR 7.18, 95% CI 2.92-17.65), and radiotherapy and hormonal therapy (OR 9.23, 95% CI 3.90-21.87, all p <0.01) was associated with increased odds of distant failure at evaluation.  Conclusions:   The combination of 11C-choline positron emission tomography/computerized tomography and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging successfully identified patterns of recurrence after postoperative radiotherapy and/or androgen deprivation therapy at a median prostate specific antigen of less than 4 ng/ml. Half of this cohort had local only recurrence and/or a low disease burden limited to pelvic lymph nodes. These patients may benefit from additional local therapy.

Transanal endoscopic surgery (TEO or TEM) is a minimally invasive technique to access the site of the RUF to perform repair.  Materials and methods:   This is an observational study with prospective data collection, conducted between September 2006 and December 2015. All patients were diagnosed with RUF following management of prostate cancer. Conservative treatment was administered in the form of urinary and fecal diversion with cystotomy and terminal colostomy, to achieve total urinary and fecal exclusion. If the fistula persisted, it was treated by TEO or TEM, with or without biological mesh interposition. If this failed, gracilis muscle was applied as salvage therapy.  Results:   Ten patients were diagnosed with RUF. In 1 patient (1 of 10), the fistula healed with bladder catheterization alone.

A system for describing tumor location will facilitate research correlating MRI and pathology.  Materials and methods:   The prostate cylindrical coordinate (PCC) system was developed for locating prostate tumors using 3 coordinate values. The 3 coordinate values include the angular location centered on the urethra, the radial distance to the periphery and the long axis from apex to base. To evaluate this system, 26 tumors were identified where the prostate cancer was noted by both the radiologist and the pathologist. PCC values were assigned independently to MRI lesions and corresponding tumors. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to assess agreement between PCC assigned using MRI and pathology. The coordinates were used to calculate the average distance between the centers of the same lesion measured by MRI and pathology.  Results:   Each of the cylindrical coordinates assigned by MRI and pathology were compared and there was no significant difference. The agreement was excellent, and the ICC was 0.70 (P<0.001) for the angular coordinate, 0.81 (P<0.001) for the radial distance, and 0.94 (P<0.001) for the long axis. Compared to pathology, lesions on MRI were significantly larger (1.17 vs. 0.86cm2, P<0.001) but there was strong agreement between the measurements on MRI and pathology (ICC = 0.89, P<0.001).

In this paper we comparatively evaluate outcome of pRCC versus ccRCC in two large multi-institutional databases (cohort study), including distribution of pRCC subtypes 1 and 2. Retrospective data of 1,943 surgically treated pRCC patients from 17 European/ North American centers between 1984-2015 were compared to 5,600 ccRCC patients from a database comprising 11 European/ North American centers (1984-2011). Median follow-up was 64.6 months. Differences between pRCC, subtypes, and ccRCC were compared with t-tests, Chi^2-tests, and exact Fisher tests. Cancer-specific mortality was analyzed with cumulative incidence curves and Cox cause-specific hazard models. The robustness of our results was examined with sensitivity analyses. We present that cancer-specific mortality rates and variables as stage, lymph node, and distant metastasis differ significantly between groups. Furthermore, we demonstrate that patients with non-metastatic pRCC had a significantly better cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.76, p = 0.007), when compared to ccRCC. Additionally, pRCC type 2 versus ccRCC exhibited no difference in cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.9, p = 0.722), whereas pRCC type 1 versus ccRCC displayed a risk of death reduced by 69% (p = 0.044).

Here we consider a commonly encountered situation in practice, when analyzing data from observational cohorts, that there are auxiliary variables which affect both the treatment and the outcome, yet these variables are not of primary interest to be included in a generalizable treatment strategy. Furthermore, there is not enough prior knowledge of the effect of the treatments or of the importance of the covariates for us to explicitly specify the dependency between the outcome and different covariates, thus we choose a model that is flexible enough to accommodate the possibly complex association of the outcome on the covariates. We consider observational studies with a survival outcome and propose to use Random Survival Forest with Weighted Bootstrap (RSFWB) to model the counterfactual outcomes while marginalizing over the auxiliary covariates. By maximizing the restricted mean survival time, we estimate the optimal regime for a target population based on a selected set of covariates.

Some of them are exerted through its specific membrane receptors type 1 and type 2 (MT1 and MT2) while others are mediated by receptor-independent mechanisms. A potential transport of melatonin through facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT/SLC2A) was proposed in prostate cancer cells. The prostate cells have a particular metabolism that changes during tumor progression. During the first steps of carcinogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation is reactivated while the switch to the ""Warburg effect"" only occurs in advanced tumors and in the metastatic stage. Here, we investigated whether melatonin might change prostate cancer cell metabolism. To do so, 13C stable isotope-resolved metabolomics in androgen sensitive LNCaP and insensitive PC-3 prostate cancer cells were employed. In addition to metabolite 13C-labeling, ATP/AMP levels, and lactate dehydrogenase or pentose phosphate pathway activity were measured. Melatonin reduces lactate labeling in androgen-sensitive cells and it also lowers 13C-labeling of tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites and ATP production. In addition, melatonin reduces lactate 13C-labeling in androgen insensitive prostate cancer cells. Results demonstrated that melatonin limits glycolysis as well as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathway in prostate cancer cells, suggesting that the reduction of glucose uptake is a major target of the indole in this tumor type.""","""['David Hevia', 'Pedro Gonzalez-Menendez', 'Mario Fernandez-Fernandez', 'Sergio Cueto', 'Pablo Rodriguez-Gonzalez', 'Jose I Garcia-Alonso', 'Juan C Mayo', 'Rosa M Sainz']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Melatonin uptake through glucose transporters: a new target for melatonin inhibition of cancer.', 'Melatonin and prostate cancer cell proliferation: interplay with castration, epidermal growth factor, and androgen sensitivity.', 'Androgen-responsive and nonresponsive prostate cancer cells present a distinct glycolytic metabolism profile.', 'The dark side of glucose transporters in prostate cancer: Are they a new feature to characterize carcinomas?', 'Regulation of cancer cell glucose metabolism is determinant for cancer cell fate after melatonin administration.', 'Melatonin and Prostate Cancer: Anti-tumor Roles and Therapeutic Application.', 'Melatonin Treatment Triggers Metabolic and Intracellular pH Imbalance in Glioblastoma.', 'Circadian Rhythm Disruption as a Contributor to Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer.', 'Melatonin Regulates the Daily Levels of Plasma Amino Acids, Acylcarnitines, Biogenic Amines, Sphingomyelins, and Hexoses in a Xenograft Model of Triple Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Melatonin Reverses the Warburg-Type Metabolism and Reduces Mitochondrial Membrane Potential of Ovarian Cancer Cells Independent of MT1 Receptor Activation.']"""

Methods:   Within Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (2001-2014), we identified patients with mRCC. Cumulative incidence and competing risks regression (CRR) models examined CSM, after accounting for other-cause mortality. Finally, we performed subgroup analyses according to histological subtype: clear-cell mRCC (ccmRCC) versus non-ccmRCC.  Results:   We identified 15,444 patients with mRCC. Of those, 41.0, 28.7 and 30.3% were diagnosed, respectively, in the contemporary, intermediate and historical years.

This study assesses cancer incidence on the island based on existing pathology reports, and compares the cancer mortality burden between Grenada and other Caribbean nations.  Methods:   Age-adjusted overall and site-specific cancer ""incidence"" rates (based on pathology reports) and mortality rates were calculated and compared for 2000-2009. Next, mortality rates for a more recent period, 2007-2013, were calculated for Grenada and a pool of English-speaking, majority African-ancestry Caribbean island nations. Lastly, for direct mortality comparisons by cancer site, mortality rate ratios were computed using negative binomial regression modeling.  Results:   The pathology reports alone do not suffice to calculate national incidence rates but cancer mortality rates are rapidly increasing in Grenada. The leading causes of cancer mortality were prostate and lung cancers among men, and breast and cervical cancers among women. Overall cancer mortality is significantly higher for both male and female Grenadians than their Caribbean counterparts: RR 1.43 (95% CI 1.32-1.55) and RR 1.26 (95% CI 1.15-1.38), respectively. High prostate and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma rates are concerning.

The present study aimed to analyze the long-term outcomes of this plugging method.  Patients and methods:   A total of 1026 groins were reviewed between May 2007 and March 2016. The plugging method was prospectively applied to patients with a PPV since May 2011. For patients with inguinal discomfort, ultrasonography was used to evaluate IH development.  Results:   An IH developed postoperatively in 35 (3.4%) groins at a median time of 22.0 months during a median follow-up of 41 months. Of the 291 groins with a PPV, plugging was performed in 167 (57.4%) groins. The presence of a PPV without the preventive procedure was a major risk factor for a postoperative IH. No prognostic difference in IH development was noted between the group without a PPV and the group with a PPV that underwent the plugging method. Body mass index (≥23.0 kg/m2) and presence of a PPV were independent predictors for IH development in groins that did not undergo the plugging method. For groins that underwent the plugging method, previous operation history was an independent predictor.

However, the precise molecular mechanism in the metastasis and invasion of HCC remain unclear.  Methods:   The expression levels of PCAT1 derived from human HCC tissues and cell lines were analyzed through quantitative real-time PCR. QRT-PCR was also applied to detect the expression of HMGB1 and miR-129-5p. Wound healing assay and transwell assays were performed to analyze cell migration and invasion ability.

Luciferase assays were used to investigate binding seeds beteen miRNA-129-5p and other transcripts, such as PCAT-1, HMGB1.  Result:   In this study, our founding demonstrated that PCAT-1 was not only aberrantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, but also associated with TNM stage, metastasis and Histological grade. In vitro, downregulation of PCAT-1 could reduce the invasion and migration of HCC cells. Moreover, our results showed that PCAT-1 could act as an endogenous RNA by directly binding to miR-129-5p. In addition, Luciferase reporter assay and western blotting analyses showed that PCAT-1 repressed inhibitory effect of miR-129-5p and reverse high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression, a target gene of miR-129-5p.

The aim of this study is to investigate the site-specific cancer risk and mortality in these patients.A retrospective cohort study of 5643 DN patients between 2000 and 2015 was conducted in 2 large hospitals in Hong Kong. Incidence and mortality of various cancers were compared with those of general population using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) respectively.With 24,726 person-years follow-up, 250 cancers were diagnosed. Overall cancer incidence was similar between DN patients and the general population (SIR 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-1.19). However, certain site-specific cancers are increased in DN patients: the highest risk was observed for laryngeal cancer (SIR 3.03, 95% CI 1.11-6.60), followed by cancers of liver (SIR 1.96, 95% CI 1.35-2.76) and colorectum (SIR 1.92, 95% CI 1.53-2.37), but the risk of prostate cancer was lower (SIR 0.48, 95% CI 0.21-0.95) in the males with DN. The SMR of all cancers was 1.17 (95% CI 1.01-1.37). For individual specific site, only colorectal cancer carried a significant higher mortality risk (SMR 2.45, 95% CI 1.82-3.23).Our data suggested that DN is associated with increased incidence of cancers of colorectum, liver, and larynx but decreased incidence of prostate cancer. Moreover, there is increased mortality of colorectal cancer in patients with DN.""","""['Chi Yuen Cheung', 'Maggie Kam Man Ma', 'Wai Leung Chak', 'Sydney Chi Wai Tang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Retrospective cohort mortality study of cancer among sewage plant workers.', 'Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Chronic Dialysis Population: A Multicenter Cohort Study.', 'Diabetes and cancer I: risk, survival, and implications for screening.', 'Mapping the cancer imaging research landscape: which cancers are more and which cancers are less frequently investigated?', 'Finerenone and effects on mortality in chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes: a FIDELITY analysis.', 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus and risk of head and neck cancer subtypes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.', 'Traditional Chinese medicine use is associated with lower end-stage renal disease and mortality rates among patients with diabetic nephropathy: a population-based cohort study.']"""

MUC1 expression was studied in patient-derived bone metastasis and CRPCs produced by prostate-specific PTEN-/- mice and LNCaP xenografts. Elevations in MUC1 expression occur in CRPC. Among nine patients with hormone-naïve bone metastasis, eight express MUC1 in 61% to 100% of PC cells. Utilizing cBioPortal PC genomic data, we organized a training (n=300), testing (n=185), and validation (n=194) cohort.

Genomic alterations in these genes reduce disease-free survival (DFS) in the training (P=.00161), testing (P=.00699), entire (training+testing, P=5.557e-5), and a validation cohort (P=3.326e-5).

Patients and Methods These are the results of a population-based observational study in Sweden from 1998 to 2012 of 118,543 men who were diagnosed with PCa with a median follow-up of 8.3 years (interquartile range, 5.2 to 11.5 years) until death from PCa or other causes. Patients were categorized by patient characteristics (marital status, educational level) and tumor characteristics (serum prostate-specific antigen, tumor grade and clinical stage) and by treatment type (radical prostatectomy, radical radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and watchful waiting). Data were stratified by Charlson comorbidity index (0, 1, 2, or ≥ 3). Mortality from PCa and other causes and after stabilized inverse probability weighting adjustments for clinical patient and tumor characteristics and treatment type was determined. Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios. Results In the complete unadjusted data set, we observed an effect of increased comorbidity on PCa-specific and other-cause mortality. After adjustments for patient and tumor characteristics, the effect of comorbidity on PCa-specific mortality was lost but maintained for other-cause mortality. After additional adjustment for treatment type, we again failed to observe an effect for comorbidity on PCa-specific mortality, although it was maintained for other-cause mortality. Conclusion This large observational study suggests that comorbidity affects other cause-mortality but not PCa-specific- mortality after accounting for patient and tumor characteristics and treatment type. Regardless of radical treatment type (radical prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy), increasing comorbidity does not seem to significantly affect the risk of dying from PCa. Consequently, differences in oncologic outcomes that were observed in population-based comparative effectiveness studies of PCa treatments may not be a result of the varying distribution of comorbidity among treatment groups.""","""['Prabhakar Rajan', 'Prasanna Sooriakumaran', 'Tommy Nyberg', 'Olof Akre', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Lars Egevad', 'Gunnar Steineck', 'N Peter Wiklund']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Association of Radical Local Treatment with Mortality in Men with Very High-risk Prostate Cancer: A Semiecologic, Nationwide, Population-based Study.', 'Outcome following active surveillance of men with screen-detected prostate cancer.

Thus, novel biomarkers are urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the biomarker potential of Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) promoter methylation and RNA expression levels for PC. Initially, by quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) analysis of a large radical prostatectomy (RP) cohort (n = 292), we found that the TFF3 promoter was significantly hypomethylated in PC compared to non-malignant (NM) prostate tissue samples (p < 0.001) with an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.908 by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Moreover, significant TFF3 promoter hypomethylation (p ≤ 0.010) as well as overexpression (p < 0.001) was found in PC samples from another large independent patient sample set (498 PC vs. 67 NM) analyzed by Illumina 450K DNA methylation arrays and/or RNA sequencing. TFF3 promoter methylation and transcriptional expression levels were inversely correlated, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the regulation of gene activity. Furthermore, low TFF3 expression was significantly associated with high ERG, ETS transcription factor (ERG) expression (p < 0.001), as well as with high Gleason score (p < 0.001), advanced pathological T-stage (p < 0.001), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after RP (p = 0.013; univariate Cox regression analysis). There were no significant associations between TFF3 promoter methylation levels, ERG status, or PSA recurrence in these RP cohorts. In conclusion, our results demonstrated diagnostic biomarker potential of TFF3 promoter hypomethylation for PC as well as prognostic biomarker potential of TFF3 RNA expression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of TFF3 promoter methylation and transcriptional expression in PC to date.""","""['Maibritt Nørgaard', 'Christa Haldrup', 'Tine Maj Storebjerg', 'Else Marie Vestergaard', 'Peter J Wild', 'Søren Høyer', 'Michael Borre', 'Torben Falck Ørntoft', 'Karina Dalsgaard Sørensen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Epigenetic silencing of MEIS2 in prostate cancer recurrence.', 'Clinical value of ERG, TFF3, and SPINK1 for molecular subtyping of prostate cancer.', 'Large-scale evaluation of SLC18A2 in prostate cancer reveals diagnostic and prognostic biomarker potential at three molecular levels.', 'Prognostic DNA methylation markers for prostate cancer.', 'Association between RASSF1A promoter methylation and prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Construction of miRNA-mRNA network and a nomogram model of prognostic analysis for prostate cancer.', 'A novel defined risk signature based on pyroptosis-related genes can predict the prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'HOXB13 and TFF3 can contribute to the prognostic stratification of prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Gene signatures predict biochemical recurrence-free survival in primary prostate cancer patients after radical therapy.', 'Advances in Prognostic Methylation Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.']"""

The objective of this study was to examine the association between dietary factors and PCa incidence and aggressiveness in a case-control study. After the analysis of the anatomic pathology, subjects were classified in patients with PCa (n = 157) and controls (n = 158). Clinical data including Gleason score, PSA values and biopsy results, were compiled. Frequencies of food consumption and sociodemographic data were also obtained. The results showed that physical activity was significantly higher in control (p < .022). It was also found that some nutritional habits offer a protective effect among studied subjects, like high nuts (p = .041) and fish (p = .041) intakes. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in risk (p = .029) in cases with a higher fruits and vegetables intakes. A decreased risk of aggressive PCa was associated with fruits, vegetables, legumes and fish intakes. However, these relationships were not statistically significant when data were adjusted for covariates. In conclusion, this study found an inverse association between PCa risk and the intake of fruits and vegetables, fish and nuts. The results suggested that a diet with higher intakes of these foods as Mediterranean diet may lower the risk of PCa in the studied population. As dietary factors are modifiable, identifying food groups or dietary patterns that modulate the risk of PCa and its aggressiveness can offer effective and practical strategies for its primary prevention.""","""['Manrique Pascual-Geler', 'Noelia Urquiza-Salvat', 'Jose Manuel Cozar', 'Inmaculada Robles-Fernandez', 'Ana Rivas', 'Luis Javier Martinez-Gonzalez', 'Francisco Manuel Ocaña-Peinado', 'Jose Antonio Lorente', 'Maria Jesus Alvarez-Cubero']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Aging Male""","""['Food Habits, Lifestyle Factors, and Risk of Prostate Cancer in Central Argentina: A Case Control Study Involving Self-Motivated Health Behavior Modifications after Diagnosis.', 'Roles of diet, lifetime physical activity and oxidative DNA damage in the occurrence of prostate cancer among men in Klang Valley, Malaysia.', 'Adherence to Mediterranean diet and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Indicators for the evaluation of diet quality.', 'Nutrition, dietary interventions and prostate cancer: the latest evidence.', 'Association between dried fruit intake and pan-cancers incidence risk: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.', 'Impact of lifestyle in prostate cancer patients.

GLO1 is up regulated in many cancer types but its role in prostate cancer is largely unknown.  Methods:   Here, we employed GLO1 immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray including 11 152 tumors and an attached clinical and molecular database.  Results:   Normal prostate epithelium was negative for GLO1, whereas 2059 (27.3%) of 7552 interpretable cancers showed cytoplasmic GLO1 staining, which was considered weak in 8.8%, moderate in 12.5%, and strong in 6.1% of tumors. Up regulation of GLO1 was significantly linked to high original Gleason grade, advanced pathological tumor stage and positive lymph node status (P < 0.0001 each). Comparison of GLO1 staining with several common genomic alterations of prostate cancers revealed a strong link between GLO1 up regulation and TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (P < 0.0001) and an ERG-independent association with PTEN deletion (P < 0.0001). GLO1 up regulation was strongly linked to early biochemical recurrence in univariate analysis (P < 0.0001) and predicted poor prognosis independent from most (except from nodal stage) established prognostic parameters in multivariate analysis (P ≤ 0.03).

Materials and methods:   Based on a risk-adapted protocol, 575 patients received either local (n = 447) or local-plus-pelvic (n = 128) radiotherapy. Gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) side effects (≥grade 2 RTOG/EORTC criteria) were prospectively assessed. Maximum morbidity, actuarial incidence rate, and prevalence rates were compared between the two groups.  Results:   For local radiotherapy, median follow-up was 68 months, and the mean dose was 66.7 Gy. In pelvic radiotherapy, the median follow-up was 49 months, and the mean local and pelvic doses were 66.9 and 48.3 Gy respectively. Early GI side effects ≥ G2 were detected in 26% and 42% of patients respectively (p < 0.001). Late GI adverse events were detected in 14% in both groups (p = 0.77). The 5‑year actuarial incidence rates were 14% and 14%, while the prevalence rates were 2% and 0% respectively. Early GU ≥ G2 side effects were detected in 15% and 16% (p = 0.96), while late GU morbidity was detected in 18% and 24% (p = 0.001). The 5‑year actuarial incidence rates were 16% and 35% (p = 0.001), while the respective prevalence rates were 6% and 8%.  Conclusions:   Despite the low prevalence of side effects, postoperative pelvic radiotherapy results in significant increases in the actuarial incidence of early GI and late GU morbidity using a conventional 4‑field box radiotherapy technique.

Upon treating APL with all-trans retinoic acid and achieving complete remission, the levels of PGD2, NKp30, ILC2s, IL-13 and M-MDSCs are restored. Similarly, disruption of this tumour immunosuppressive axis by specifically blocking PGD2, IL-13 and NKp30 partially restores ILC2 and M-MDSC levels and results in increased survival.

In multivariable Cox regression analyses adjusted for standard clinicopathologic features, incidental PC was not associated with cancer-specific (HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.91-1.35, p = 0.30) or overall mortality (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 0.83-1.35, p = 0.65).  Conclusions:   Incidental PC at RC for UCB is a frequent event. However, the majority of PC cases are well-differentiated and organ-confined. Presence of incidental PC shows significant geographic differences. The risk of BCR after incidental PC is low and incidental PC is not associated with survival in UCB patients treated with RC.""","""['Rieken Malte', 'Luis A Kluth', 'Dharam Kaushik', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Mohammad Abufaraj', 'Beat Foerster', 'Michael Rink', 'Kilian Gust', 'Florian Roghmann', 'Joachim Noldus', 'Dimitri Vordos', 'Masayuki Hagiwara', 'Eiji Kikuchi', 'Masaomi Ikeda', 'Kazumasa Matsumoto', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Morgan Rouprêt', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Douglas S Scherr', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Veronika Seebacher']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Eur J Surg Oncol""","""['Impact of smoking and smoking cessation on outcomes in bladder cancer patients treated with radical cystectomy.', 'Effect of diabetes mellitus and metformin use on oncologic outcomes of patients treated with radical cystectomy for urothelial carcinoma.', 'Extranodal extension is a powerful prognostic factor in bladder cancer patients with lymph node metastasis.', 'Prognostic influence of prostate gland invasion by bladder tumour and/or prostate cancer in cystoprostatectomy specimen: a review.', 'Do circulating tumor cells have a role in deciding on adjuvant chemotherapy after radical cystectomy?', 'Neobladder ""Function"": Tips and Tricks for Surgery and Postoperative Management.', 'Assessment of 5-year overall survival in bladder cancer patients with incidental prostate cancer identified at radical cystoprostatectomy.']"""

Therefore, we developed and internally validated prediction models for biochemical failure (BF) and a composite endpoint (CE) following focal salvage high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for radiorecurrent prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A prospective HIFU registry identified 150 cases (November 2006-August 2015). Recurrence was assessed with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with template prostate mapping biopsies, targeted biopsies, or systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies. Metastatic disease was ruled out with a positron emission tomography-computed tomography and a bone scan. Focal salvage HIFU consisted of quadrant-ablation, hemi-ablation, or index-lesion ablation. Cox-regression was used for BF (Phoenix-definition) and CE (BF/MRI+/biopsies+/local or systemic treatment/metastases+/prostate cancer specific mortality+). Internal validation was performed using bootstrap resampling (500 datasets) after which C-statistic and hazard ratios were adjusted. Models were calibrated and risk scores created.  Results:   Median follow-up was 35 months (interquartile range: 22-52). Median biochemical disease-free survival (DFS) was 33 months (95% CI: 23-45). Median CE-free survival was 24 months (95% CI: 21-35). After multivariable analysis, DFS interval after primary radiotherapy, presalvage prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA-doubling time, prostatic volume, and T-stage (both MRI based) predicted BF. For the CE, PSA-doubling time was not predictive but additionally, primary Gleason score was. The adjusted C-statistics were 0.68 and 0.64 for BF and CE, respectively. Calibration was accurate until 48 months. The risk scores showed 3 groups, with biochemical DFS of 60%, 35%, and 7% and CE-free survival of 40%, 24%, and 0% at 4 years.

Internationally, several initiatives to improve cancer outcomes have focused on earlier presentation to healthcare and timely diagnosis. We aimed to measure the effect of community-based symptom awareness and general practice-based educational interventions on the time to diagnosis in rural patients presenting with breast, prostate, colorectal or lung cancer in Western Australia.  Methods:   2 × 2 factorial cluster randomised controlled trial. Community Intervention: cancer symptom awareness campaign tailored for rural Australians. GP intervention: resource card with symptom risk assessment charts and local cancer referral pathways implemented through multiple academic detailing visits. Trial Area A received the community symptom awareness and Trial Area B acted as the community campaign control region. Within both Trial Areas general practices were randomised to the GP intervention or control.  Primary outcome:   total diagnostic interval (TDI).  Results:   1358 people with incident breast, prostate, colorectal or lung cancer were recruited. There were no significant differences in the median or ln mean TDI at either intervention level (community intervention vs control: median TDI 107.5 vs 92 days; ln mean difference 0.08 95% CI -0.06-0.23 P=0.27; GP intervention vs control: median TDI 97 vs 96.5 days; ln mean difference 0.004 95% CI -0.18-0.19 P=0.99). There were no significant differences in the TDI when analysed by factorial design, tumour group or sub-intervals of the TDI.  Conclusions:   This is the largest trial to test the effect of community campaign or GP interventions on timeliness of cancer diagnosis. We found no effect of either intervention.

Interestingly, three major subgroups of genomic subcomplexes were identified, where selective gain of function for AR genomic action in tumorigenesis was found, dictated by FOXA1 and HOXB13.

Here we show that CLP/Cotl1 is highly expressed in a rat epithelial breast cancer cell line (FE1.3) compared with its mesenchymal counterpart (FE1.2). Knockdown of CLP/Cotl1 in FE1.3 cells increased cell proliferation, whereas its overexpression in FE1.2 cells inhibited proliferation in culture and reduced tumor growth in xenograft assays in mice. Mechanistically, we identified two major pathways through which CLP/Cotl1 exerts its suppressive effects. First, CLP/Cotl1 re-expression in FE1.2 and in human MCF7 breast cancer cells induced expression of the growth-suppressor gene interleukin-24 (IL-24), which independently of p53 upregulates the tumor-suppressor genes p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22 (PERP) and p21cip1. Second, overexpression of CLP/Cotl1 potentiated the growth-suppressive effect of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1), leading to downregulation of TGFβ-responsive genes vascular growth factor A/B (VEGFA/VEGFB), hypoxia inducing factor 1α (HIF-1α) and trombospondin 1 (TSP1), which mediate various hallmarks of cancer progression including angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. CLP/Cotl1 inhibited TGFβ signaling via a non-canonical signaling involving IL-24-instigated inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and subsequent post-transcriptional downregulation of SMAD2 and SMAD4. We also showed that CLP/COTL1 expression sensitizes breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and this was further enhanced by addition of exogenous TGFβ1. CLP/Cotl1 expression is lost in many human malignancies including prostate, uterine and breast cancers. Thus, our results uncover a novel tumor-suppressor role for CLP/Cotl1 and identify the downstream effectors interleukin 24 (IL-24)/PERP and IL-24/MAPK/ERK/TGFβ as potential targets for precision therapy.""","""['L Xia', 'X Xiao', 'W L Liu', 'Y Song', 'T J J Liu', 'Y J Li', 'E Zacksenhaus', 'X J Hao', 'Y Ben-David']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Novel signaling molecules implicated in tumor-associated fatty acid synthase-dependent breast cancer cell proliferation and survival: Role of exogenous dietary fatty acids, p53-p21WAF1/CIP1, ERK1/2 MAPK, p27KIP1, BRCA1, and NF-kappaB.', 'Small bowel carcinoid (enterochromaffin cell) neoplasia exhibits transforming growth factor-beta1-mediated regulatory abnormalities including up-regulation of C-Myc and MTA1.', 'Genetic and epigenetic silencing of mircoRNA-506-3p enhances COTL1 oncogene expression to foster non-small lung cancer progression.', 'hRAD9 functions as a tumor suppressor by inducing p21-dependent senescence and suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition through inhibition of Slug transcription.', 'PERP-ing into diverse mechanisms of cancer pathogenesis: Regulation and role of the p53/p63 effector PERP.', 'Genetic Risk Factors Related to Coronary Artery Disease and Role of Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 Polymorphisms.', 'Coactosin-Like Protein in Breast Carcinoma: Friend or Foe?', 'A critical ETV4/Twist1/Vimentin axis in Ha-RAS-induced aggressive breast cancer.', 'TGF-Β1 & PNPLA3 Genetic Variants and the Risk of Hepatic Fibrosis and HCC in Egyptian Patients with HCV-Related Liver Cirrhosis.', 'Long noncoding RNA Cfast regulates cardiac fibrosis.']"""

As such, radiolabeled PSMA inhibitors are of great value for diagnosis and staging of this disease. Herein, we disclose the preclinical characterization of [55Co]PSMA-617 for positron emission tomography (PET)/x-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging of prostate cancer lesions.  Procedures:   By the application of microwave heating, PSMA-617 in acetate buffer (0.4 M, pH 4.4) was labeled with the radioisotopes cobalt-55/57. The extents of internalization and dissociation constants (K D) were determined against 2-(phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid in two PSMA-positive cell lines, LNCaP, and PC3-PIP, with [57Co]PSMA-617 as a surrogate for [55Co]PSMA-617 (T½ 17.5 h, β max 1.5 MeV, Iβ 76 %). The biodistribution in LNCaP xenograft mice was investigated using [57Co]PSMA-617 and [55Co]PSMA-617 was employed for PET/CT imaging at 1, 4, and 24 h and compared to PET/CT scans using [68Ga]PSMA-617.  Results:   The radiolabeling with cobalt-55/57 was performed in yields greater than 99.5 and 99.8 % and radiochemical purities of 99.7 and 98.9 %, respectively. The molar-specific activities were 18.2 MBq/nmol and 3.3 MBq/nmol. The cellular K D were determined to be 4.7 nM for LNCaP and 9.8 nM for PC3-PIP, correspondingly. Internalization of 76 and 71 % of the cell-associated radioactivity was found for LNCaP and PC3-PIP cells after incubation up to 240 min, respectively. In regard to the biodistribution in LNCaP xenograft mice, [57Co]PSMA-617 displayed a high and relatively constant uptake in the tumor (12.9 %IA/g at 1 h to 10.5 %IA/g at 24 h) with an initial but transient high uptake in the kidneys, adrenals, and spleen. Tumor-to-background ratios improved over time as normal tissue cleared of the radioligand (tumor-to-blood: 26, 258, and 3013; tumor-to-kidney: 0.11, 0.28, and 4.3 at 1, 4, and 24 h). PET/CT imaging with [55Co]PSMA-617 in xenograft mice confirmed the high tumor uptake and fast clearance of normal tissues over time and was found superior to imaging with [68Ga]PSMA-617.  Conclusion:   Radiolabeling of PSMA-617 was achieved in excellent yields and radiochemical purities. Favorable in vitro data comprising low K D values and high extent of internalization was determined for two PSMA-positive cell lines. In xenograft mice, high tumor accumulation and excellent tumor-to-normal tissues ratios were established by biodistribution experiments and PET/CT imaging and, hence, confirm the potential of [55Co]PSMA-617 for delayed clinical imaging of prostate cancer.""","""['Johan Hygum Dam', 'Birgitte Brinkmann Olsen', 'Christina Baun', 'Poul Flemming Høilund-Carlsen', 'Helge Thisgaard']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Targeting PSMA with a Cu-64 Labeled Phosphoramidate Inhibitor for PET/CT Imaging of Variant PSMA-Expressing Xenografts in Mouse Models of Prostate Cancer.', 'Development of Novel PSMA Ligands for Imaging and Therapy with Copper Isotopes.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-ligand positron emission tomography and radioligand therapy (RLT) of prostate cancer.', 'Imaging Prostate Cancer With Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET/CT and PET/MRI: Current and Future Applications.', 'Modulating the pharmacokinetic profile of Actinium-225-labeled macropa-derived radioconjugates by dual targeting of PSMA and albumin.', 'Yields of Photo-Proton Reactions on Nuclei of Nickel and Separation of Cobalt Isotopes from Irradiated Targets.', 'Production, Purification, and Applications of a Potential Theranostic Pair: Cobalt-55 and Cobalt-58m.', 'Towards Targeted Alpha Therapy with Actinium-225: Chelators for Mild Condition Radiolabeling and Targeting PSMA-A Proof of Concept Study.', 'Benefit of Later-Time-Point PET Imaging of HER3 Expression Using Optimized Radiocobalt-Labeled Affibody Molecules.']"""

TCM is a quantitative tool for the real-time assessment of HIFU dose. TCM provides quantitative analysis of the backscatter pulse echo signals (pre and immediately post HIFU) for each individual ablative site, using ultrasonic tissue characterization as a surrogate for monitoring tissue temperature. Real-time analysis generates an energy difference parameter (ΔE in dB) that is proportional to tissue temperature.  Methods:   Post in vitro studies, two clinical studies were conducted to validate the TCM algorithm on the Sonablate® device. Studies enrolled histologically confirmed, organ confined prostate cancer patients. The first clinical study was conducted in two phases for whole gland ablation. First eight patients' data were used to measure the algorithm performance followed by 89 additional patients for long term outcome. The second clinical study enrolled five patients; four patients with focal cancer had hemi-ablation only and one had whole gland ablation. Four 3 Fr. needles containing three thermocouples each were placed transperineally in the prostate to record tissue temperatures in the focal zone, posterior to the focal zone and on the lateral gland where no HIFU was applied. Tissue temperatures from the focal zone were correlated to the ΔE parameter.  Results:   In the first clinical study, the average TCM rate was 86%. Pre and 6 months post HIFU, median PSA was 7.64 and 0.025 ng/ml respectively and 97% patients had negative biopsy. For the second clinical study, the measured prostate tissue temperatures (Average, Max, and Min) in the ablation zones were 84°, 114° and 60 °C and the corresponding ΔE (dB/10) parameters were 1.05, 2.6 and 0.4 resulting in 83% of temperatures in the range of 75°-100 °C and 17% in the 60°-74 °C range. Outside the focal zone, the average temperature was 50 °C and in the lateral lobe where no HIFU was applied, peak temperature was 40.7 °C.  Conclusions:   The TCM algorithm is able to estimate tissue changes reliably during the HIFU procedure for prostate tissue ablation in real-time and can be used as a guide for HIFU dose delivery and tissue ablation control.""","""['Narendra T Sanghvi', 'Wo-Hsing Chen', 'Roy Carlson', 'Clint Weis', 'Ralf Seip', 'Toyoaki Uchida', 'Michael Marberger']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Ther Ultrasound""","""['The Association of Tissue Change and Treatment Success During High-intensity Focused Ultrasound Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer treatment by the latest focal HIFU device with MRI/TRUS-fusion control biopsies: A prospective evaluation.', 'Calibration of ultrasound backscatter temperature imaging for high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment planning.', 'High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer: A Review.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for definitive treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of Morphological and Morphometric Changes in a Parenchymal Tissue after the Radiofrequency Ablation Procedure.', 'Review of Robot-Assisted HIFU Therapy.', 'The Association of Tissue Change and Treatment Success During High-intensity Focused Ultrasound Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Thermal Ablation and High-Resolution Imaging Using a Back-to-Back (BTB) Dual-Mode Ultrasonic Transducer: In Vivo Results.', 'Imaging-based internal body temperature measurements: The journal Temperature toolbox.']"""

Without clear pathological indicators of disease trajectory at diagnosis, management of PrCa is challenging, given its wide-ranging manifestation from indolent to highly aggressive disease. This study examines the role in PrCa of the Pygopus (PYGO)2 chromatin effector protein as a risk stratification marker in PrCa.  Methods:   RNA expression was performed in PrCa cell lines using Northern and RT-PCR analyses. Protein levels were assessed using immunoblot and immunofluorescence. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays constructed from radical prostatectomies with 5-year patient follow-up data including Gleason score tumour staging, margin and lymph node involvement and prostate serum antigen (PSA) levels. Biochemical recurrence (BR) was defined as a postoperative PSA level of >0.2 nL. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SAS and Kaplan-Meier curves using graphPad (Prism).  Results:   In vitro depletion of PYGO2 by RNAi in both androgen receptor positive and negative PrCa cell lines attenuated growth and reduced Ki67 and 47S rRNA expression, while PYGO2 protein was localised to the nuclei of tumours as determined by immunohistochemistry. High expression levels of PYGO2 in tumours (n=156) were correlated with BR identified as PSA progression, after 7-year follow-up independent of other traditional risk factors. Most importantly, high PYGO2 levels in intermediate grade tumours suggested increased risk of recurrence over those with negative or weak expression.

The mechanisms by which DIM and ring-DIMs induce autophagy have not been elucidated. As DIM is a mitochondrial ATP-synthase inhibitor, we hypothesized that DIM and ring-DIMs induce autophagy via alteration of intracellular AMP/ATP ratios and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling in prostate cancer cells. We found that DIM and ring-DIMs induced autophagy was accompanied by increased autophagic vacuole formation and conversion of LC3BI to LC3BII in LNCaP and C42B human prostate cancer cells. DIM and ring-DIMs also induced AMPK, ULK-1 (unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1; Atg1) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. DIM and the ring-DIMs time-dependently induced the oncogenic protein astrocyte-elevated gene 1 (AEG-1) in LNCaP and C42B cells. Downregulation of AEG-1 or AMPK inhibited DIM- and ring-DIM-induced autophagy. Pretreatment with ULK1 inhibitor MRT 67307 or siRNAs targeting either AEG-1 or AMPK potentiated the cytotoxicity of DIM and ring-DIMs. Interestingly, downregulation of AEG-1 induced senescence in cells treated with overtly cytotoxic concentrations of DIM or ring-DIMs and inhibited the onset of apoptosis in response to these compounds. In summary, we have identified a novel mechanism for DIM- and ring-DIM-induced protective autophagy, via induction of AEG-1 and subsequent activation of AMPK. Our findings could facilitate the development of novel drug therapies for prostate cancer that include selective autophagy inhibitors as adjuvants.""","""['Hossam Draz', 'Alexander A Goldberg', 'Vladimir I Titorenko', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns', 'Stephen H Safe', 'J Thomas Sanderson']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""[""Ring-substituted analogs of 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) induce apoptosis and necrosis in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells."", ""3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) and its ring-substituted halogenated analogs (ring-DIMs) induce differential mechanisms of survival and death in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells."", 'Autophagy inhibition improves the chemotherapeutic efficacy of cruciferous vegetable-derived diindolymethane in a murine prostate cancer xenograft model.', ""Targeting the 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and related metabolic pathways for the treatment of prostate cancer."", 'AMPK: Regulation of Metabolic Dynamics in the Context of Autophagy.', 'Design and Synthesis of AMPK Activators and GDF15 Inducers.', ""3,3'-diindolylmethane inhibits LPS-induced human chondrocytes apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation by activating PI3K-Akt-mTOR-mediated autophagy."", 'Autophagy and beyond: Unraveling the complexity of UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) from biological functions to therapeutic implications.', 'T4 reduces cisplatin resistance by inhibiting AEG-1 gene expression in lung cancer cells.', ""AMPK's double-faced role in advanced stages of prostate cancer.""]"""

Clinical management of metastatic patients has become increasingly complex as novel therapeutic strategies have emerged. This study aims at evaluating the impact of the first metastatic progression on the outcome of PCa patients treated with curative intent.  Methods:   The analysis was conducted using data of 913 cases of localized PCa diagnosed between 2000 and 2014. All patients were treated with curative surgery (N = 382) or radiotherapy (N = 531) with or without adjuvant therapy. All metastases were radiologically documented. The prognostic impact of the first site of metastasis on metastasis-free survival (MFS) and PCa-specific survival (PCaSS) was investigated by univariate and multivariate analyses.  Results:   One hundred and thirty-six (14.9%) patients developed a metastatic hormone-sensitive PCa and had a median PCaSS of 50.4 months after first metastatic progression. Bone (N = 50, 36.8%) and LN or locoregional (N = 52, 38.2%) metastases occurred more frequently with a median PCaSS of 39.7 and 137 months respectively (p < 0.0001). Seven patients developed visceral metastasis only (5.1%; liver, lung, brain) and 27 (19.9%) concurrent metastases; this last group was associated with the worst survival with a median value of only 17 months. Thus, each subgroup exhibited a survival after metastasis significantly different from each other. In multivariate analysis the site of the first metastasis was an independent prognostic factor for PCaSS along with Gleason score at diagnosis. The correlation between survival and first site of metastasis was confirmed separately for each therapy subgroup. Median metastasis-free survival from primary diagnosis to first metastasis was not correlated with the first site of metastasis.  Conclusions:   In non-metastatic PCa patients treated with curative intent, the PCa-specific survival time depends on the time after metastatic progression rather than the time from diagnosis to metastasis. Moreover, the site of first metastasis is an independent prognostic factor for PCaSS. Our data confirm that the first metastatic event may confer a differential prognostic impact and may help in identifying patient at high risk of death supporting the treatment-decision making process following metastatic progression.""","""['Mariarosa Pascale', 'Che Ngwa Azinwi', 'Barbara Marongiu', 'Gianfranco Pesce', 'Flavio Stoffel', 'Enrico Roggero']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Impact of the Site of Metastases on Survival in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Differential Risk of Castration Resistance After Initial Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Metastatic prostate carcinoma to bone: clinical and pathologic features associated with cancer-specific survival.', 'Prospects of immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate carcinoma--a review.', 'Cytoreductive, radical prostatectomy in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Approaches to Prevent and Manage Cardiovascular Disease in Patients Receiving Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Embryologic and hormonal contributors to prostate cancer in transgender women.', 'Multi-institutional Analysis of the Clinical and Genomic Characteristics of Black Patients with Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'The potential of CAR T cell therapy for prostate cancer.', 'A Suite of Activity-Based Probes To Dissect the KLK Activome in Drug-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Yet, this is associated with many uncertainties. With regard to therapy decision-making, additional markers are needed to allow an exact risk prediction. Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (EEF1A2) was previously suggested as driver of tumor progression and potential biomarker. In the present study its functional and prognostic relevance in prostate cancer was investigated.  Methods:   EEF1A2 expression was analyzed in two cohorts of patients (n = 40 and n = 59) with localized PCa. Additionally data from two large expression dataset (MSKCC, Cell, 2010 with n = 131 localized, n = 19 metastatic PCa and TCGA provisional data, n = 499) of PCa patients were reanalyzed. The expression of EEF1A2 was correlated with histopathology features and biochemical recurrence (BCR). To evaluate the influence of EEF1A2 on proliferation and migration of metastatic PC3 cells, siRNA interference was used. Statistical significance was tested with t-test, Mann-Whitney-test, Pearson correlation and log-rank test.  Results:   qRT-PCR revealed EEF1A2 to be significantly overexpressed in PCa tissue, with an increase according to tumor stage in one cohort (p = 0.0443). In silico analyses in the MSKCC cohort confirmed the overexpression of EEF1A2 in localized PCa with high Gleason score (p = 0.0142) and in metastatic lesions (p = 0.0038). Patients with EEF1A2 overexpression had a significantly shorter BCR-free survival (p = 0.0028). EEF1A2 expression was not correlated with serum PSA levels. Similar results were seen in the TCGA cohort, where EEF1A2 overexpression only occurred in tumors with Gleason 7 or higher. Patients with elevated EEF1A2 expression had a significantly shorter BCR-free survival (p = 0.043). EEF1A2 knockdown significantly impaired the migration, but not the proliferation of metastatic PC3 cells.  Conclusion:   The overexpression of EEF1A2 is a frequent event in localized PCa and is associated with histopathology features and a shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival. Due to its independence from serum PSA levels, EEF1A2 could serve as valuable biomarker in risk-stratification of localized PCa.""","""['Thomas Stefan Worst', 'Frank Waldbillig', 'Abdallah Abdelhadi', 'Cleo-Aron Weis', 'Maria Gottschalt', 'Annette Steidler', 'Jost von Hardenberg', 'Maurice Stephan Michel', 'Philipp Erben']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Phosphodiesterase SMPDL3B Gene Expression as Independent Outcome Prediction Marker in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'High expression of ASPM correlates with tumor progression and predicts poor outcome in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Enhanced expression of centromere protein F predicts clinical progression and prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'eEF1A2 as a putative oncogene.', 'Integrin Expression in Localized Prostate Cancer: A TCGA and MSKCC Cohort-based Exploratory In Silico Analysis.', ""eEF1A2 siRNA Suppresses MPP+-Induced Activation of Akt and mTOR and Potentiates Caspase-3 Activation in a Parkinson's Disease Model."", 'The progress of protein synthesis factors eIFs, eEFs and eRFs in inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer pathogenesis.', 'High eEF1A1 Protein Levels Mark Aggressive Prostate Cancers and the In Vitro Targeting of eEF1A1 Reveals the eEF1A1-actin Complex as a New Potential Target for Therapy.', 'Integrative analysis identifies key genes related to metastasis and a robust gene-based prognostic signature in uveal melanoma.', 'Targeting IRES-dependent translation as a novel approach for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy.']"""

However, the molecular mechanism of PCAT-1 involved in PC is poorly defined. In this study, we found that PCAT-1 expression was up-regulated and miR-145-5p expression was down-regulated in PC tissues and cells. Function analysis indicated that PCAT-1 overexpression promoted proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibited apoptosis of PC cells. Rescue experiments demonstrated that miR-145-5p restoration attenuated the promotive effects of PCAT1 on PC progression, while Fascin-1 (FSCN1) upregulation relieved the anti-cancer role of miR-145-5p in PC. Mechanical analysis discovered that PCAT-1 could act as a miR-145-5p sponge to modulate FSCN1 expression. In conclusion, these findings suggested that PCAT-1 accelerated PC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and suppressed apoptosis by up-regulating FSCN1 mediated via miR-145-5p, hinting a potential therapeutic strategy for PC patients.""","""['Weibo Xu', 'Junkai Chang', 'Xinyi Du', 'Junqing Hou']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Long noncoding RNA PCAT-1 promotes invasion and metastasis via the miR-129-5p-HMGB1 signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Long non-coding RNA linc00673 regulated non-small cell lung cancer proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition by sponging miR-150-5p.', 'Restoration of miR-145 expression suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion in prostate cancer by targeting FSCN1.', 'PCAT-1: A Novel Oncogenic Long Non-Coding RNA in Human Cancers.', 'Roles and mechanisms of miR-195-5p in human solid cancers.', 'Noncoding RNAs in apoptosis: identification and function.', 'The Role of Fascin-1 in Human Urologic Cancers: A Promising Biomarker or Therapeutic Target?', 'Comprehensive analysis of the FOXA1-related ceRNA network and identification of the MAGI2-AS3/DUSP2 axis as a prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer.', 'Identification and functional analysis of LncRNA-XIST ceRNA network in prostate cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA in prostate cancer.']"""

Castration in male rodents increases pain perception which is reversed by testosterone replacement. Pain perception also improves in hypogonadal men with testosterone therapy. However, it remains unclear whether androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with an increase in pain perception.  Objectives:   To evaluate the effects of ADT on pain perception, depression and quality of life (QOL) in men with PCa.  Methods:   Thirty-seven men with PCa about to undergo ADT with leuprolide acetate (ADT group) were followed prospectively for six months to evaluate changes in clinical and experimental pain. Forty men who had previously undergone prostatectomy for localized PCa and were in remission served as controls (non-ADT group). All participants were eugonadal at study entry. Primary outcomes were changes in clinical pain (assessed with Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire) and experimental pain (assessed with quantitative sensory testing). Secondary outcomes included evaluation of depression, anxiety levels, and quality of life.  Results:   Serum testosterone levels significantly decreased in the ADT group but remained unchanged in the non-ADT group. There were no significant changes in pain thresholds, ratings, or other responses to quantitative sensory tests over the 6-month course of the study. Clinical pain did not differ between the two groups, and no changes from baseline were observed in either group. Men undergoing ADT did experience worsening of depression (0.93; 95% CI = 0.04-1.82; P = 0.042) and QOL related to physical role limitation (-18.28; 95% CI = -30.18 to -6.37; P = 0.003).

Materials and methods:   We used data on 376 untreated men with hypogonadism (testosterone 12.1 nmol/l or less) recruited from a urology office in Germany. Age at study entry served as a surrogate for age at the first detection of testosterone below 12.1 nmol/l. We derived 3 indicators, including the coefficient of variation, the ratio of the largest decline relative to the mean and the median of maximum declines, to measure the dynamic patterns of testosterone in an individual.  Results:   Our findings suggest that the later that testosterone dropped below 12.1 nmol/l in a man, the less the lifetime risk of prostate cancer in that individual (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.82). Further declines or dynamic variations of testosterone were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer (high vs low coefficient of variation HR 4.88, 95% CI 1.97-12.08, high vs low ratio of largest decline relative to mean HR 8.45, 95% CI 2.82-25.37 and high vs low median of maximum declines HR 2.70, 95% CI 1.15-6.35).

Systematic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies served as the reference standard.  Materials and methods:   A total of 120 consecutive patients were retrospectively included in the study. In these patients the overall PI-RADS score was 3 after 3 Tesla T2-weighted imaging, diffusion weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging as well as subsequent targeted magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion guided biopsies plus systematic 12-core transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies. The study end points were the prostate cancer detection rate, the Gleason score distribution, the prostate cancer location and risk stratification by subgroup analyses.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 13 of 118 patients for a detection rate of 11%, including 5 patients (4.2%) with a Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7 or greater. Three of the 212 lesions (1.4%) in the transition zone and 6 of the 64 (9.4%) in the peripheral zone were positive for prostate cancer. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging revealed patterns of peripheral prostatitis combined with diffuse stromal hyperplasia in 54% of the patients with prostate cancer. Prostate volume was significantly lower in patients with prostate cancer (p = 0.015) but differences in prostate specific antigen levels were not statistically significant (p = 0.87). Prostate specific antigen density was higher in patients with prostate cancer (0.19 vs 0.12 ng/ml/ml).  Conclusions:   Low grade prostate cancer (Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6) can develop in patients with an overall PI-RADS score of 3. Prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7 or greater can be detected by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging with a high degree of certainty. Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 or greater prostate cancer is unlikely in PI-RADS 3 lesions. Therefore, these patients should primarily undergo followup multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.

DNA isolated from the cancer region was extracted and subjected to high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization. A high GEMCaP score was defined as 20% or greater of genomic loci showing copy number gain or loss in a given tumor.

Overall 38% of patients experienced recurrence with a median time to recurrence of 45 months. Based on the CAPRA-S (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical) score 39% of the patients were at low risk, 42% were at intermediate risk and 19% were at high risk. The GEMCaP score was high (20% or greater) in 31% of the cohort. A high GEMCaP score was associated with a higher risk of biochemical recurrence (HR 2.69, 95% CI 1.51-4.77) and it remained associated after adjusting for CAPRA-S score and age (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.06-3.56).

Therefore, in this study we investigated the significance of missense polymorphisms in the gene encoding GNRH in men treated with primary androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   This study included 80 Japanese patients with metastatic prostate cancer with available serum testosterone levels during androgen deprivation therapy. We examined the association of GNRH1 (rs6185, S20W) and GNRH2 (rs6051545, A16V) gene polymorphisms with clinicopathological parameters, including serum testosterone levels during androgen deprivation therapy, as well as prognosis, including progression-free and overall survival.  Results:   The CT and CT/TT alleles in the GNRH2 gene (rs6051545) were associated with higher serum testosterone during androgen deprivation therapy compared with those of the CC allele. Consequently the CT alleles were associated with a higher risk of progression after adjustment for age and serum testosterone during androgen deprivation therapy (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.00-3.00, p = 0.049).

Disease volume was characterized as the percent of positive cores, the number of cores with greater than 50% involvement, the largest involvement of any single core and prostate specific antigen density. Nonparametric testing was performed to compare the median Genomic Prostate Score™ and the likelihood of favorable pathology findings between quartiles of disease volume.  Results:   We identified 112 (37.8%) and 184 men (62.2%) at NCCN very low and low risk, respectively. Median scores did not differ significantly between disease volume quartiles (all p >0.05). However, the median likelihood of favorable pathology findings statistically differed between volume quartiles (all <0.05). Seven of the 105 men (6.3%) with very low risk disease were reclassified at low risk and 13 of 181 (7.2%) with low risk disease were reclassified at intermediate risk. Genomic disease reclassification did not depend on biopsy tumor volume.  Conclusions:   In patients with NCCN very low and low risk prostate cancer genomic scores did not demonstrate meaningfully significant differences by volume based on clinically established cutoff points. Moreover, genomic scores identified and reclassified men with higher risk disease despite generally acceptable surveillance characteristics in this group according to grade and volume.

Since inter-patient anatomy variations can result in considerable differences in estimated risk we aimed to explore the influence of inter-fractional organ motion patterns on SC risk.  Methods:   Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans were generated on the planning CT (pCT) scans of eight prostate cancer patients. In addition, the treatment plans were re-calculated on 8-9 repeat CTs (rCTs) of each patient acquired throughout the treatment course. Relative risk (RR) of SC (VMAT/IMPT) was calculated for the planned and the re-calculated dose distributions using the organ equivalent dose concept adapted to a linear and a bell-shaped competition dose-response model.  Results:   Day-to-day variations in anatomy lead to fluctuations in SC risk estimates of the same order of magnitude as those caused by inter-patient variations. Using the competition model, the RR range for bladder cancer based on the pCTs was 0.4-3.4, while a considerably wider range was found when including all rCTs (0.2-6.7). There was nevertheless a correlation in RR based on repeat CTs for individual patients, indicating that patient-specific SC risks could be estimated.  Conclusions:   The estimated relative risks varied considerably across rCTs and could change the risk in favour of VMAT/IMPT depending on the anatomy of the day.

In that context, our objective was to investigate the role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in prostate cancer risk based on the EPICAP data. EPICAP is a population-based case-control study carried out in 2012-2013 (département of Hérault, France) that enrolled 819 men aged less than 75 years old newly diagnosed for prostate cancer and 879 controls frequency matched to the cases on age. Face to face interviews gathered information on several potential risk factors including NSAIDs use. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression models. All-NSAIDs use was inversely associated with prostate cancer: OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98, especially in men using NSAIDs that preferentially inhibit COX-2 activity (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.79). Nonaspirin NSAIDs users had a decreased risk of prostate cancer (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.99), particularly among men with an aggressive prostate cancer (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.89) and in men with a personal history of prostatitis (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07-0.59). Our results are in favor of a decreased risk of prostate cancer in men using NSAIDs, particularly for men using preferential anti-COX-2 activity. The protective effect of NSAIDs seems to be more pronounced in aggressive prostate cancer and in men with a personal history of prostatitis, but this needs further investigations to be confirmed.""","""['Solene Doat', 'Sylvie Cénée', 'Brigitte Trétarre', 'Xavier Rebillard', 'Pierre-Jean Lamy', 'Jean-Pierre Bringer', 'François Iborra', 'Thibaut Murez', 'Marie Sanchez', 'Florence Menegaux']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Prostatitis, other genitourinary infections and prostate cancer risk: Influence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs?

Patients and methods:   A total of 11 794 lobes, from 6 360 patients who underwent robot-assisted RP between 2008 and 2016 were evaluated. Clinicopathological features were included in a statistical algorithm for the prediction of the maximum ECE width. Five multivariable logistic models were estimated for: presence of ECE and ECE width of >1, >2, >3, and >4 mm. A five-zone decision rule based on a lower and upper threshold is proposed. Using a graphical interface, surgeons can view patient's pre-treatment characteristics and a curve showing the estimated probabilities for ECE amount together with the areas identified by the decision rule.  Results:   Of the 6 360 patients, 1 803 (28.4%) were affected by non-organ-confined disease. ECE was present in 1 351 lobes (11.4%) and extended beyond the capsule for >1, >2, >3, and >4 mm in 498 (4.2%), 261 (2.2%), 148 (1.3%), 99 (0.8%) cases, respectively.

Sample size was at least 181 patients per cohort/treatment type. QoL was recorded at baseline and at each follow-up using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) instrument. The minimal clinically important difference was defined as half of the standard deviation of the baseline score for each domain. A mixed effects model was used to compare the different treatments. Data are presented on the brachytherapy and the bilateral nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) cohorts. Hormonotherapy was not allowed.  Results:   Between November 2007 and January 2013, 181 patients who received brachytherapy and 210 patients who underwent RARP were included. Of the patients who underwent RARP, 178 had bilateral nerve-sparing and were included in the present analysis. Response rate to EPIC questionnaires were higher in the brachytherapy than in the RARP arm: 82% vs 57% at 2 years after treatment and 55% vs 45% at 4 years after treatment. In the mixed effects model, patients in the RARP arm had better QoL with regard to urinary irritation/obstruction or bother and bowel function, and lower QoL regarding sexual function and urinary incontinence. Results were confirmed in a propensity score-matched model. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the brachytherapy group at 1, 2 and 3 years after treatment.

It is traditionally used for the treatment of diarrhea, hypertension, neuroprotection, jaundice, and arthritis. We used the wild-collected VTT and sterilized them to establish the plant tissue culture, and then took the leaves for DNA sequencing to determine its original base. We use methanol to extract VTT in four different solvents: 1-butanol, n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and water. These four preliminary extracts were used to treat human prostate cancer DU145 cells in vitro. We use the flow cytometry to check the cell survival situation. Finally, we found the ethyl acetate layer roughing product (referred VTEA) in human prostate cancer apoptotic effects of cell line DU-145. In the present studies, we use the crude extract of VTT to examine whether or not it can induce apoptosis of DU145 cells in vitro. Viability assays for extracts of VTT treatment showed that it had dose-dependent effect on human prostate cancer DU145 cells. We also found that the extract of VTT induces time-dependent mitochondrial and intrinsic-dependent apoptosis pathways. The in vitro cytotoxic effects were investigated by cell cycle analysis and the determination of apoptotic DNA fragmentation in DU145 cells. The cell cycle analysis showed that extracts of VTT induced a significant increase in the number of cells in G0 /G1 phase. The extract of VTT induced chromatin changes and apoptosis of DU145 cells also were confirmed by DAPI and PI staining that were measured by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. Finally, the expression of relevant proteins was analyzed by Western blot analysis.

Overall, mortality from obesity and tobacco-related cancers was higher among Mexican origin populations in the US compared to Mexico, suggesting a higher risk for these cancers, while mortality from prostate, stomach, and especially cervical and pediatric cancers was markedly higher in Mexico. Among children, brain cancer and neuroblastoma patterns suggest an environmental role in the etiology of these malignancies as well.

Methods:   Among patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy at Boramae Medical Center, 470 patients who underwent standard 12-core trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy were selected for the analysis. The number of overlapping line was determined in each patient, and its effects on tumor volume were evaluated after adjusting for other variables.  Results:   Median prostate specific antigen level was 9.1 ng/mL, and the maximum % cancer in positive cores was 42.8%.

However, it remains controversial whether dietary fatty acids are correlated with tumor progression. In this study, we demonstrate that increased Src kinase activity is associated with high-fat diet-accelerated progression of prostate tumors and that Src kinases mediate this pathological process. Moreover, in the in vivo prostate regeneration assay, host SCID mice carrying Src(Y529F)-transduced regeneration tissues were fed a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet and treated with vehicle or dasatinib. The high-fat diet not only accelerated Src-induced prostate tumorigenesis in mice but also compromised the inhibitory effect of the anticancer drug dasatinib on Src kinase oncogenic potential in vivo We further show that myristoylation of Src kinase is essential to facilitate Src-induced and high-fat diet-accelerated tumor progression. Mechanistically, metabolism of exogenous myristic acid increased the biosynthesis of myristoyl CoA and myristoylated Src and promoted Src kinase-mediated oncogenic signaling in human cells. Of the fatty acids tested, only exogenous myristic acid contributed to increased intracellular myristoyl CoA levels.

We aimed to explore whether expression of selected genes in the adrenergic, serotoninergic, glucocorticoid, and dopaminergic pathways differs in prostate tumor tissue from men with lethal disease compared with men with nonlethal disease.Methods: On the basis of the Swedish Watchful Waiting Cohort, we included 511 men diagnosed with incidental prostate cancer through transurethral resection of the prostate during 1977-1998 with follow-up up to 30 years. For those with tumor tissue (N = 262), we measured mRNA expression of 223 selected genes included in neuroendocrine pathways. Using DNA from normal prostate tissue (N = 396), we genotyped 36 SNPs from 14 receptor genes. Lethal prostate cancer was the primary outcome in analyses with pathway gene expression and genetic variants.Results: Differential expression of genes in the serotoninergic pathway was associated with risk of lethal prostate cancer (P = 0.007); similar but weaker associations were noted for the adrenergic (P = 0.014) and glucocorticoid (P = 0.020) pathways. Variants of the HTR2A (rs2296972; P = 0.002) and NR3CI (rs33388; P = 0.035) genes (within the serotoninergic and glucocorticoid pathways) were associated with lethal cancer in overdominant models. These genetic variants were correlated with expression of several genes in corresponding pathways (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Our findings lend support to hypothesis that the neuroendocrine pathways, particularly serotoninergic pathway, are associated with lethal outcome in the natural course of localized prostate cancer.Impact: This study provides evidence of the role of neuroendocrine pathways in prostate cancer progression that may have clinical utility.

This study investigated the contribution of 11OHA4 and 11OHT to the pool of active androgens in the prostate. Steroid profiles were determined in LNCaP, C4-2B and VCaP cell models, in PCa tissue, and in plasma focussing on the inactivation, reactivation and glucuronidation of 11OHA4, 11OHT and their downstream products using ultra-performance convergence chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPC2-MS/MS). The C11-oxy C19 steroids were the predominant steroids with the production of 11KT and 11KDHT in prostate cell models identifying 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 activity. Active:inactive steroid ratios indicated efficient inactivation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 11KDHT by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, while the reactivation of DHT by retinol-like dehydrogenases was greater than the reactivation of 11KDHT. In PCa tissue, inactive C11-oxy C19 steroids ranged from 27 to 30 ng/g, whereas inactive C19 steroids were below 1 ng/g. Steroid glucuronidation was impeded: in VCaP cells, the C11-oxy C19 steroids were unconjugated and the C19 steroids fully conjugated; in C4-2B cells, all steroids were unconjugated, except for DHT of which 50% was conjugated; in LNCaP cells only androsterone, 11KT and 11β-hydroxyandrosterone were unconjugated. In PCa patients' plasma 11KDHT was present only in the unconjugated form, with 11KT also predominantly unconjugated (90-95%). Even though plasma and tissue sample numbers were limited, this study serves to demonstrate the abundance of C11-oxy C19 steroids, with notable differences in their metabolism, dictated by steroidogenic enzymes and hampered conjugation, affecting active androgen levels. Larger cohorts are required to analyse profiles in modulated metabolic pathways, in order to shed light on treatment outcomes.

Materials and methods:   We identified 34 patients with a co-registered simulation CT and T2 weighted MRI. The VUA was located on CT and MRI whilst blinded to the opposing scan. The differences were analysed using Wilcoxon's Signed Rank Test. The mrVUA coverage was investigated using three ctCTV margins of 5mm, 8mm and 12mm.  Results:   Median age was 63years with 59% having pT3a disease and median Gleason score of 7. The mrVUA was coincident with the ctVUA in 12% and inferior in 88%. Median difference was 5mm (0-10mm) (P<0.0001). Only a ctCTV margin of 12mm would have encompassed all mrVUAs. A ctCTV margin of 8mm and 5mm resulted in 12% and 38% cases where the VUA was excluded from the ctCTV.

We also demonstrated that immunization of mice with the bivalent vaccine (Ad5-PSA+PSCA) inhibited the growth of established prostate tumors. However, there are multiple challenges hindering the success of immunological therapies in the clinic. One of the prime concerns has been to overcome the immunological tolerance and maintenance of long-term effector T cells. In this study, we further characterized the use of the bivalent vaccine (Ad5-PSA+PSCA) in a transgenic mouse model expressing human PSA in the mouse prostate. We demonstrated the expression of PSA analyzed at the mRNA level (by RT-PCR) and protein level (by immunohistochemistry) in the prostate lobes harvested from the PSA-transgenic (PSA-Tg) mice. We established that the administration of the bivalent vaccine in surgifoam to the PSA-Tg mice induces strong PSA-specific effector CD8+ T cells as measured by IFN-γ secretion and in vitro cytotoxic T-cell assay. Furthermore, the use of surgifoam with Ad5-PSA+PSCA vaccine allows multiple boosting vaccinations with a significant increase in antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. These observations suggest that the formulation of the bivalent prostate cancer vaccine (Ad5-PSA+PSCA) with surgifoam bypasses the neutralizing antibody response, thus allowing multiple boosting. This formulation is also helpful for inducing an antigen-specific immune response in the presence of self-antigen, and maintains long-term effector CD8+ T cells.""","""['Dev Karan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Vaccine""","""['Dual antigen target-based immunotherapy for prostate cancer eliminates the growth of established tumors in mice.', 'Vaccination with a DNA vaccine based on human PSCA and HSP70 adjuvant enhances the antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response and inhibits the PSCA+ tumors growth in mice.', 'Bovine papillomavirus prostate cancer antigen virus-like particle vaccines are efficacious in advanced cancers in the TRAMP mouse spontaneous prostate cancer model.', 'CpG oligonucleotide as an adjuvant for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen vaccines for prostate cancer.', 'Co-transient expression of PSA-Fc and PAP-Fc fusion protein in plant as prostate cancer vaccine candidates and immune responses in mice.', 'Cationic nanoparticles enhance T cell tumor infiltration and antitumor immune responses to a melanoma vaccine.', 'Remodelling of the tumour microenvironment by the kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'Immunotherapy: Newer Therapeutic Armamentarium against Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Cancer stem cells: Regulation programs, immunological properties and immunotherapy.']"""

Baseline clinical parameters predicting that treatment response could help inform clinical decisions were explored.  Objective:   To identify patients who derive the greatest clinical benefit from AAP treatment.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 1088 mCRPC patients treated with either AAP or prednisone in the first-line setting in COU-AA-302 were included in this post hoc analysis.  Intervention:   Abiraterone acetate1000mg daily versus placebo, both plus prednisone 10mg daily.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed, including clinical and pathological parameters for the primary end points overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and secondary study end points. Tumor-associated baseline parameters independently impacting OS were applied to stratify patients according to possible treatment effects.  Results and limitations:   Baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA), tumor-related pain as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), and Gleason score (GS) at primary diagnosis were identified as tumor-associated variables that independently impacted OS. AAP significantly improved outcomes versus prednisone in both group 1 (BPI-SF 0-1 and PSA <80 ng/ml and GS <8; p=0.006; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.61) and group 2 (BPI-SF 2-3 and/or PSA ≥80 ng/ml and/or GS ≥8; p=0.03; HR: 0.84). The differences observed for treatment effects between groups 1 and 2 for OS (HR: 0.61 vs 0.84), rPFS (HR: 0.41 vs 0.59), and time to chemotherapy (HR: 0.64 vs 0.71) were not statistically significant.  Conclusions:   AAP significantly improved outcomes in mCRPC patients compared with prednisone alone regardless of baseline pain and PSA level, and GS at primary diagnosis with no significant differences between observed treatment effects in groups 1 and 2.

However, although adipokines and their receptors are widely distributed in many tissues and exhibit a clear modulation according to particular metabolic conditions (e.g., obesity and/or fasting), their expression, regulation, and putative action on normal prostate glands (PGs; a hormone-dependent organ tightly regulated by the endocrine-metabolic milieu) are still to be defined. Different in vivo/in vitro models were used to comprehensively characterize the expression pattern and actions of different adipokine systems (i.e., leptin/adiponectin/resistin/receptors) in mouse PGs. Adiponectin, resistin, and adiponectin receptors (1 and 2) and leptin receptor are coexpressed at different levels in PG cells, wherein they are finely regulated under fasting and/or obesity conditions. Furthermore, treatment with different adipokines exerted both homologous and heterologous regulation of specific adipokines/receptor-synthesis and altered the expression of key proliferation and oncogenesis markers (i.e., Ki67/c-Myc/p53) in mouse PG cell cultures, wherein some of these actions might be elicited through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. Moreover, treatment with leptin, adiponectin, and resistin differentially regulated key functional parameters [i.e., proliferation and migration capacity and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) secretion] in human normal and/or tumoral prostate cell lines. Altogether, our data show that various adipokine and receptor systems are differentially expressed in normal PG cells; that their expression is under a complex ligand- and receptor-selective regulation under extreme metabolic conditions; and that they mediate distinctive and common direct actions in normal and tumoral PG cells (i.e., homologous and heterologous regulation of ligand and receptor synthesis, ERK signaling activation, modulation of proliferation markers, proliferation and migration capacity, and PSA secretion), suggesting a relevant role of these systems in the regulation of PG pathophysiology.""","""['André Sarmento-Cabral', 'Fernando L-López', 'Raúl M Luque']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Adipokines (Leptin, Adiponectin, Resistin) Differentially Regulate All Hormonal Cell Types in Primary Anterior Pituitary Cell Cultures from Two Primate Species.', 'GW4064, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, upregulates adipokine expression in preadipocytes and HepG2 cells.', 'Leptin and adiponectin interact in the regulation of prostate cancer cell growth via modulation of p53 and bcl-2 expression.', 'New approach in the interpretation of adipose tissue.', 'Adipokines: adiponectin, leptin, resistin and coronary heart disease risk.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Seminal Levels of Omentin-1/ITLN1 in Inflammatory Conditions Related to Male Infertility and Localization in Spermatozoa and Tissues of Male Reproductive System.', 'Clinical association of metabolic syndrome, C-reactive protein and testosterone levels with clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Bone Marrow Adipocyte: An Intimate Partner With Tumor Cells in Bone Metastasis.']"""

Based on quantitative analyses of large-scale organ reconstructions and proliferation kinetics measurements, we propose that morphogenesis follows from the proliferative activity of equipotent tips that stochastically branch and randomly explore their environment but compete neutrally for space, becoming proliferatively inactive when in proximity with neighboring ducts.

Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASp) is a scaffold protein which can directly bind to actin monomers and Arp2/3 and is a crucial player in the formation of an invadopodium precursor. Expression modulation has pointed to an important role for N-WASp in invadopodium formation but the role of its C-terminal VCA domain in this process remains unknown. In this study, we generated alpaca nanobodies against the N-WASp VCA domain and investigated if these nanobodies affect invadopodium formation. By using this approach, we were able to study functions of a selected functional/structural N-WASp protein domain in living cells, without requiring overexpression, dominant negative mutants or siRNAs which target the gene, and hence the entire protein. When expressed as intrabodies, the VCA nanobodies significantly reduced invadopodium formation in both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and HNSCC61 head and neck squamous cancer cells. Furthermore, expression of distinct VCA Nbs (VCA Nb7 and VCA Nb14) in PC-3 prostate cancer cells resulted in reduced overall matrix degradation without affecting MMP9 secretion/activation or MT1-MMP localisation at invadopodial membranes. From these results, we conclude that we have generated nanobodies targeting N-WASp which reduce invadopodium formation and functioning, most likely via regulation of N-WASp-Arp2/3 complex interaction, indicating that this region of N-WASp plays an important role in these processes.""","""['Tim Hebbrecht', 'Isabel Van Audenhove', 'Olivier Zwaenepoel', 'Adriaan Verhelle', 'Jan Gettemans']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Nanobodies targeting cortactin proline rich, helical and actin binding regions downregulate invadopodium formation and matrix degradation in SCC-61 cancer cells.', 'Stratifying fascin and cortactin function in invadopodium formation using inhibitory nanobodies and targeted subcellular delocalization.', 'Interactions of isolated C-terminal fragments of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) with actin and Arp2/3 complex.', 'WIP: WASP-interacting proteins at invadopodia and podosomes.', ""The 'ins' and 'outs' of podosomes and invadopodia: characteristics, formation and function."", 'WASP family proteins: Molecular mechanisms and implications in human disease.', 'Proteomics and its applications in breast cancer.', 'Molecular Basis of LH Action on Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion via Kinase and Scaffold Proteins.', 'Mechanism of WASP and WAVE family proteins in the progression of prostate cancer.', 'Nanobodies Right in the Middle: Intrabodies as Toolbox to Visualize and Modulate Antigens in the Living Cell.']"""

Here, we studied the impact of resveratrol over a 100-fold concentration range on cell death and proliferation of HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. After 96 h of treatment, a biphasic pattern was observed. At lower concentrations (1 and 10 μmol/l), resveratrol increased the cell number, as did the polyphenol quercetin. At 50 or 100 μmol/l, resveratrol reduced the cell number and increased the percentage of apoptotic or necrotic cells, thus indicating cytotoxicity. On HCT116 colon cancer cells, however, no proliferative properties of resveratrol were observed. Resveratrol-induced cytotoxicity on HT-29 cells was associated with NADPH oxidase activation and increased levels of histone γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, paralleled by enhanced sirtuin 6 levels, likely as a repair mechanism.

Therefore, it is important to seek a new alternative therapeutic medicine that can effectively prevent the disease and even eradicate the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer. Vernonia amygdalina Delile (VAD) is a common edible vegetable in Cameroon that has been used as a traditional medicine for some human diseases. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous reports have explored its therapeutic efficacy against human prostate cancer. The objective of the present study was to assess the anticancer activities of VAD methanolic extracts in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer using human androgen-independent prostate cancer (PC-3) cells as a test model. To achieve our objective, PC-3 cells were treated with various doses of VAD for 48 h. Data generated from the trypan blue test and MTT assay demonstrated that VAD extracts exhibited significant growth-inhibitory effects on PC-3 cells. Collectively, we established for the first time the antiproliferative effects of VAD on PC-3 cells, with an IC50 value of about 196.6 µg/mL. Further experiments, including cell morphology, lipid peroxidation and comet assays, and apoptosis analysis showed that VAD caused growth-inhibitory effects on PC-3 cells through the induction of cell growth arrest, DNA damage, apoptosis, and necrosis in vitro and may provide protection from oxidative stress diseases as a result of its high antioxidant content.

Objectives:   To apply the Tomita and revised Tokuhashi scoring systems to a surgical cohort at a single academic institution and analyze spine-related surgical morbidity and mortality rates.  Summary of background data:   Surgical management of metastatic spine patients requires tools that can accurately predict patient survival, as well as knowledge of morbidity and mortality rates.  Methods:   An Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Spine Center surgical database was queried (years 2002-2010) to identify patients with an ICD-9 code indicative of metastatic spine disease. Patients whose only surgical treatment was vertebral augmentation were not included. Scatter plots of survival versus the Tomita and revised Tokuhashi metastatic spine scoring systems were statistically analyzed. Spine-related morbidity and mortality rates were calculated.  Results:   Sixty-eight patients were identified: 45 patients' (30 male patients, mean age 45 y) medical records included operative, morbidity, and mortality statistic data and 38 (26 male patients, mean age 54 y) contained complete metastatic spine scoring system data. Of the 38 deceased spine metastatic patients, 8 had renal cell, 7 lung, 4 breast, 2 chondrosarcoma, 2 prostate, 11 other, and 4 unknown primary cancers. Linear regression analysis revealed R values of 0.2570 and 0.2009 for the revised Tokuhashi and Tomita scoring systems, respectively. Overall transfusion, infection, morbidity, and mortality rates were 33% and 9%, and 42% and 9%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Application of metastatic prognostic scoring systems to a retrospective surgical cohort revealed an overall poor correlation with the Tomita and revised Tokuhashi predictive survival models. Morbidity and mortality rates concur with those in the medical literature. This study underscores the difficulty in utilizing metastatic spine scoring systems to predict patient survival.

A mortality follow-back study of Dutch patients with five types of cancer""","""Purpose:   The purpose of this study is to describe and compare the relation between treatment aims, hospitalizations, and hospital mortality for Dutch patients who died from lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, or pancreatic cancer.  Methods:   A mortality follow-back study was conducted within a sentinel network of Dutch general practitioners (GPs), who recorded the end-of-life care of 691 patients who died from one of the abovementioned cancer types between 2009 and 2015. Differences in care by type of cancer were analyzed using multilevel analyses to control for clustering within general practices.  Results:   Among all cancer types, patients with prostate cancer most often and patients with pancreatic cancer least often had a palliative treatment aim a month before death (95% resp. 84%). Prostate cancer patients were also least often admitted to hospital in the last month of life (18.5%) and least often died there (3.1%), whereas lung cancer patients were at the other end of the spectrum with 41.8% of them being admitted to hospital and 22.6% dying in hospital. Having a palliative treatment aim and being older were significantly associated with less hospital admissions, and having a palliative treatment aim, having prostate cancer, and dying in a more recent year were significantly associated with less hospital deaths.  Conclusion:   There is large variation between patients with different cancer types with regard to treatment aims, hospital admissions, and hospital deaths. The results highlight the need for early initiation of GP palliative care to support patients from all cancer types to stay at the place they prefer as long as possible.""","""['Mariska Oosterveld-Vlug', 'Gé Donker', 'Femke Atsma', 'Linda Brom', 'Yvonne de Man', 'Stef Groenewoud', 'Bregje Onwuteaka-Philipsen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Hospitalisations at the end of life: using a sentinel surveillance network to study hospital use and associated patient, disease and healthcare factors.', 'Hospitalizations of cancer patients in the last month of life: quality indicator scores reveal large variation between four European countries in a mortality follow-back study.', 'Cancer and end of life: the management provided during the year and the month preceding death in 2015 and causes of death in France.', 'Trends in the prevalence of malignancy among patients admitted with acute heart failure and associated outcomes: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Cancer patients use hospital-based care until death: a further analysis of the Dutch Bone Metastasis Study.', 'Resource use in the last year of life of prostate cancer patients-A register-based analysis.', 'Evaluating quality of care at the end of life and setting best practice performance standards: a population-based observational study using linked routinely\xa0collected administrative databases.', 'Health care utilization among patients with oesophageal and gastric cancer: the impact of initial treatment strategy and assignment of a contact nurse.', 'Days Spent at Home near the End of Life in Japanese Elderly Patients with Lung Cancer: Post hoc Analysis of A Prospective Study.', 'Regional variation in hospital care at the end-of-life of Dutch patients with lung cancer exists and is not correlated with primary and long-term care.']"""

Methods and materials:   Twenty-four high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with an HDR boost of 2 × 8.5 Gy were included. Patients received an MRI for planning (MRI1), before (MRI2), and after treatment (MRI3). Time from needle insertion to MRI3 was ∼3 hours. Needle migration was evaluated from coregistered images: MRI1-MRI2 and MRI1-MRI3. Dose volume histogram parameters from the treatment plan based on MRI1 were related to parameters based on needle positions in MRI2 or MRI3. Regression was used to model the average needle migration per implant and change in D90 clinical target volume, CTVprostate+3mm. The model fit was used for estimating the dosimetric impact in equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions for dose levels of 6, 8.5, 10, 15, and 19 Gy.  Results:   Needle migration was on average 2.2 ± 1.8 mm SD from MRI1-MRI2 and 5.0 ± 3.0 mm SD from MRI1-MRI3. D90 CTVprostate+3mm was robust toward average needle migration ≤3 mm, whereas for migration >3 mm D90 decreased by 4.5% per mm. A 3 mm of needle migration resulted in a decrease of 0.9, 1.7, 2.3, 4.8, and 7.6 equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions for dose levels of 6, 8.5, 10, 15, and 19 Gy, respectively.

More sensitive biopsies (eg, template prostate mapping biopsy [TPMB]) are too resource intensive for routine use, and there is little evidence on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MPMRI).  Objective:   To identify the most effective and cost-effective way of using these tests to detect CS prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Cost-effectiveness modelling of health outcomes and costs of men referred to secondary care with a suspicion of prostate cancer prior to any biopsy in the UK National Health Service using information from the diagnostic Prostate MR Imaging Study (PROMIS).  Intervention:   Combinations of MPMRI, TRUSB, and TPMB, using different definitions and diagnostic cut-offs for CS cancer.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Strategies that detect the most CS cancers given testing costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) given long-term costs.  Results and limitations:   The use of MPMRI first and then up to two MRI-targeted TRUSBs detects more CS cancers per pound spent than a strategy using TRUSB first (sensitivity = 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.92-0.98] vs 0.91 [95% CI 0.86-0.94]) and is cost effective (ICER = £7,076 [€8350/QALY gained]). The limitations stem from the evidence base in the accuracy of MRI-targeted biopsy and the long-term outcomes of men with CS prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   An MPMRI-first strategy is effective and cost effective for the diagnosis of CS prostate cancer. These findings are sensitive to the test costs, sensitivity of MRI-targeted TRUSB, and long-term outcomes of men with cancer, which warrant more empirical research. This analysis can inform the development of clinical guidelines.

Currently, it mainly features Gallium-68 (68Ga) labeled PSMA ligands, notably [68Ga]Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC ([68Ga]-PSMA-11) and [68Ga]DOTAGA-FFK (Sub-KuE termed ([68Ga]PSMA-I&T).

Here, we describe a simple synthesis and validation of a fluorine-18 labeled Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC ([Al18F]PSMA-11) for nuclear medicine applications. An efficient method for preparation of [Al18F]PSMA-11 was developed and validated (according to Pharm Eur) for routinely clinical applications. [Al18F]PSMA-11 was reproducibly obtained in radiochemical yields of 84 ± 6% (n = 15) and > 98% radiochemical purity using an improved one-step radiofluorination in aqueous solution. The total (production/preparation) time, including purification, pharmacological formulation of the isolated product and the quality control of the injectable solution was less than 60min. The [Al18F]PSMA-11 was stable over 4h in 1% EtOH/saline selected as injection solution. The solution was sterile, non-pyrogenic and ready for clinical applications after sterile filtration through a 0.22µm membrane filter under sterile conditions. In addition, [Al18F]PSMA-11 exhibited higher uptake and retention in PMSA-expressing LNCap prostate cells as compared to its clinically established 68Ga-labeled analogues [68Ga]PSMA-11 and [68Ga]PSMA-I&T as well as to [68Ga]NOTA-Bn-PSMA. The simple and fast preparation of [Al18F]PSMA-11 combined with its favorable pharmacological properties warrant its translation to a clinical setting.

To date, in addition to human and bovine α-LA, the ability to form such anti-tumor complexes with OA was described for goat and camel α-LA. Although the mechanisms of the anticancer activity of human and bovine α-LA are already well-studied, little is currently known about the anticancer action of this camel protein. The goal of this study was to fill this gap and to analyze the anticancer and pro-apoptotic activities of camel α-LA in its free form (α-cLA) and as an OA-containing complex (OA-α-cLA) using four human cancer cell lines, including Caco-2 colon cancer cells, PC-3 prostate cancer cells, HepG-2 hepatoma cells, and MCF-7 breast cancer cells as targets. The anti-tumor activities of OA-α-cLA and α-cLA were analyzed using MTT test, annexin/PI staining, cell cycle analysis, nuclear staining, and tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibition methods. We show here that the OA-α-cLA complex does not affect normal cells but has noticeable anti-cancer activity, especially against MCF-7 cells, thus boosting the anticancer activity of α-cLA and improving the selectivity of OA. The OA-α-cLA complex mediated cancer cell death via selective induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest at lower IC50 than that of free α-cLA by more than two folds. However, OA induced apoptosis at higher extent than OA-α-cLA and α-cLA. OA also caused unselective apoptosis-dependent cell death in both normal and cancer cells to a similar degree. The apoptosis and cell-cycle arresting effect of OA-α-cLA may be attributed to the TK inhibition activity of OA. Therefore, OA-α-cLA serves as efficient anticancer complex with two functional components, α-cLA and OA, possessing different activities. This study declared the effectiveness of OA-α-cLA complex as a promising entity with anticancer activity, and these formulated OA-camel protein complexes constitute an auspicious approach for cancer remedy, particularly for breast cancer.""","""['Vladimir N Uversky', 'Esmail M El-Fakharany', 'Marwa M Abu-Serie', 'Hussein A Almehdar', 'Elrashdy M Redwan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cancer Invest""","""['The Use of Human, Bovine, and Camel Milk Albumins in Anticancer Complexes with Oleic Acid.', 'Bovine lactoferrin binds oleic acid to form an anti-tumor complex similar to HAMLET.', 'Not all AMLETs are made equal: complexes of cow and camel α-lactalbumin with oleic acid show different structure and stability.', 'Bioactivity of α-lactalbumin related to its interaction with fatty acids: a review.', 'The biological activities of protein/oleic acid complexes reside in the fatty acid.', 'Anticancer activity of lactoferrin-coated biosynthesized selenium nanoparticles for combating different human cancer cells via mediating apoptotic effects.', 'Scaling-up strategies for controllable biosynthetic ZnO NPs using cell free-extract of endophytic Streptomyces albus: characterization, statistical optimization, and biomedical activities evaluation.', 'Exploring the mechanisms by which camel lactoferrin can kill Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and Shigella sonnei.', 'Exploitation of cantaloupe peels for bacterial cellulose production and functionalization with green synthesized Copper oxide nanoparticles for diverse biological applications.', ""Camels' biological fluids contained nanobodies: promising avenue in cancer therapy.""]"""

Here, we developed a high-throughput peptide microarray assay to identify altered histone lysine (de)acetylation activity in prostate cancer (PCa). This microarray-based activity assay revealed up-regulated histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity against specific histone H3 sites in a castrate-resistant (CR) PCa cell line compared to its hormone-sensitive (HS) isogenic counterpart. NAD+-dependent deacetylation assays revealed down-regulated sirtuin activity in validated CR lines. Levels of acetyltransferases GCN5, PCAF, CBP, and p300 were unchanged between matched HS and CR cell lines. However, autoacetylation of p300 at K1499, a modification known to enhance HAT activity and a target of deacetylation by SIRT2, was highly elevated in CR cells, while SIRT2 protein level was reduced in CR cells. Interrogation of HS and matched CR xenograft lines reveals that H3K18 hyperacetylation, increased p300 activity, and decreased SIRT2 expression are associated with progression to CR in 8/12 (66%). Tissue microarray analysis revealed that hyperacetylation of H3K18 is a feature of CRPC. Inhibition of p300 results in lower H3K18ac levels and increased expression of androgen receptors. Thus, a novel histone array identifies altered enzyme activities during the progression to CRPC and may be utilized in a personalized medicine approach. Reduced SIRT2 expression and increased p300 activity lead to a concerted mechanism of hyperacetylation at specific histone lysine sites (H3K9, H3K14, and H3K18) in CRPC.""","""['Jin-Hee Lee', 'Bing Yang', 'Anastasia J Lindahl', 'Nathan Damaschke', 'Melissa D Boersma', 'Wei Huang', 'Eva Corey', 'David F Jarrard', 'John M Denu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""ACS Chem Biol""","""['Dysregulation of Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) and histone H3K18 acetylation pathways associates with adverse prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Activation of p300 histone acetyltransferase activity and acetylation of the androgen receptor by bombesin in prostate cancer cells.', 'Acetylation of Sirt2 by p300 attenuates its deacetylase activity.', 'Histone Acetylation Enzymes Coordinate Metabolism and Gene Expression.', 'Histone acetyl transferases as emerging drug targets.', 'Applications of Peptide Microarrays in Autoantibody, Infection, and Cancer Detection.', 'Epigenetic mechanisms underlying prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'Decoding LncRNAs.', 'Hydroxamic acid-modified peptide microarrays for profiling isozyme-selective interactions and inhibition of histone deacetylases.', 'The SIRT3 and SIRT6 Promote Prostate Cancer Progression by Inhibiting Necroptosis-Mediated Innate Immune Response.']"""

The aim of the present study was to develop multifunctional targeted nanoconstructs, which can efficiently and precisely deliver siRNA and silence the desired gene of interest in various LHRH overexpressing cancer cells. Herein, we report the development of triblock, PAMAM-histidine-PEG dendritic nanoconstructs functionalized with triptorelin (an LHRH analog) for targeted siRNA delivery to LHRH overexpressing breast (MCF-7) and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cells. The nanoconstructs were characterized using 1H NMR and DLS and displayed a very low cationic charge to avoid off-target interactions. The developed nanoconstructs showed negligible cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity with efficient siRNA loading, excellent serum stability, and strongly protected siRNA from degradation. Further, confocal microscopy results confirmed extremely significant (p < 0.001) higher cellular uptake of cy5.5 conjugated targeted nanoparticles (NPs) in both cancer cell lines than nontargeted NPs. Also, targeted NPs specifically delivered cy3-tagged siRNA to MCF-7 cells. Co-localization studies in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells further established that targeted NPs traveled through the endolysosomal pathway and escaped endosomes within 6 h of incubation. Gene silencing studies in luciferase expressing MCF-7 and LNCaP cell lines demonstrated that the targeted NPs exhibited extremely significant (p < 0.001) silencing of luciferase gene. Additionally, receptor blockade studies further confirmed the specificity of targeted NPs and suggested that targeted NPs entered cancer cells via LHRH receptor mediated endocytosis, which was evident through insignificant gene silencing in receptor blocked cells. Thus, the results indicated that PAMAM-histidine-PEG-triptorelin could be a promising approach for siRNA delivery, gene silencing, and tumor therapy in all LHRH overexpressing cancer cells.""","""['Prajakta Tambe', 'Pramod Kumar', 'Yogesh A Karpe', 'Kishore M Paknikar', 'Virendra Gajbhiye']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Targeted silencing of the MCL-1 gene using multi-layered dendrimer-based nanoconstructs achieves efficient tumor regression in xenografted mice models.', 'Tumor-targeted pH/redox dual-sensitive unimolecular nanoparticles for efficient siRNA delivery.', 'Bioconjugated gold nanoparticles enhance cellular uptake: A proof of concept study for siRNA delivery in prostate cancer cells.', 'Fundamentals of siRNA and miRNA therapeutics and a review of targeted nanoparticle delivery systems in breast cancer.', 'Progress in Delivery of siRNA-Based Therapeutics Employing Nano-Vehicles for Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Nanoparticles as Drug Delivery Systems of RNAi in Cancer Therapy.', 'Transferrin Conjugated pH- and Redox-Responsive Poly(Amidoamine) Dendrimer Conjugate as an Efficient Drug Delivery Carrier for Cancer Therapy.', 'Functionalized Folate-Modified Graphene Oxide/PEI siRNA Nanocomplexes for Targeted Ovarian Cancer Gene Therapy.', 'PAMAM-cRGD mediating efficient siRNA delivery to spermatogonial stem cells.', 'The Role of Nanovaccine in Cross-Presentation of Antigen-Presenting Cells for the Activation of CD8+ T Cell Responses.']"""

The protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play an important role in the growth, differentiation and apoptosis of cells. AngII action depends on the hormonal milieu of the cell, and on sex steroid influence. Angiotensin 1‑7 (Ang1‑7), metabolite of AngII, shows opposite action to AngII in cells. The present study aimed to examine the influence of 17β‑estradiol and testosterone on AngII and Ang1‑7 action on PTK activity in androgen‑independent humane prostate cancer cell line DU145. Cell cultures of human prostate cancer DU145 cells were used as a source of PTKs. Cultures were exposed to different concentrations of AngII (5x10‑11 to 5x10‑9 M). The incubation with hormones lasted 15 min to limit the genomic effects of steroids. In the phosphorylation reaction, we used γ32P‑ATP as a donor of phosphate and a synthetic peptide, Poly(Glu, Tyr) (4:1), as a substrate. The specific activities of PTKs were defined as pmol of 32P incorporated into 1 mg of exogenous Poly(Glu, Tyr) per minute (pmol/mg/min). Our findings suggest that testosterone and 17β‑estradiol may change the effects of angiotensins in a rapid non‑genomic way, probably via membrane‑located receptors. The most significant change was caused by testosterone, whose effect was most significant on changes caused by Ang1‑7. AngII‑induced changes in phosphorylation appeared to be insensitive to the presence of testosterone, but were modified by 17β‑estradiol.""","""['Kamila Domińska', 'Antoni Kowalski', 'Tomasz Ochędalski', 'Elżbieta Rębas']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['The effect of angiotensin 1-7 on tyrosine kinases activity in rat anterior pituitary.', 'Specific amino acid dependency regulates invasiveness and viability of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Angiotensin receptors in hormone-independent prostate cancer cell line DU145: presence of two variants of angiotensin type 1 receptor.', 'Regulation of angiotensin II receptors beyond the classical pathway.', 'Sex steroid hormone metabolism and prostate cancer.', 'Cell Uptake of Steroid-BODIPY Conjugates and Their Internalization Mechanisms: Cancer Theranostic Dyes.', 'Association of a common genetic variant (insertion/deletion) in ACE gene with prostate cancer susceptibility in a Tunisian population.', 'The Effect of Local Renin Angiotensin System in the Common Types of Cancer.', 'Angiotensin II and Angiotensin Receptors 1 and 2-Multifunctional System in Cells Biology, What Do We Know?', 'Interaction of Cytochrome C Oxidase with Steroid Hormones.']"""

Materials and methods:   The single-arm phase I/II trial registered as EudraCT 2009-017259-91 involved 27 patients with rising PSA levels.

The median PSADT in all treated patients increased from 5.67 months prior to immunotherapy to 18.85 months after 12 doses (p < 0.0018). Twelve patients who continued immunotherapy with the second cycle had a median PSADT of 58 months that remained stable after the second cycle. In the peripheral blood, specific PSA-reacting T lymphocytes were increased significantly already after the fourth dose, and a stable frequency was detected throughout the remainder of DCVAC/PCa treatment. Long-term immunotherapy of prostate cancer patients experiencing early signs of PSA recurrence using DCVAC/PCa was safe, induced an immune response and led to the significant prolongation of PSADT.

Methods:   We analyzed 47 patients who received CBZ chemotherapy for mCRPC in our institutions. The NLR was calculated using the neutrophil and lymphocyte counts before CBZ chemotherapy. We determined the NLR cut-off value based on the sensitivity and specificity levels derived from area under the receiver operator characteristic curves for death. A multivariate analysis was performed to investigate the association between the NLR and the prognosis.  Results:   The median overall survival (OS) after CBZ was 10.0 months (range: 6.3-13.2). The median OS was shorter in patients with a high NLR (≥3.83) than in those with a low NLR (<3.83) (5.8 versus 13.2 months, p = 0.018).

However, in prostate cancer (PC), absent or limited responses have been reported. To investigate further, we compared the phenotype of infiltrating T-cells isolated from prostate tissue from patients with PC (n = 5), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (n = 27), BPH with concurrent PC (n = 4) and controls (n = 7). The majority of T-cells were CD8+ and had a CCR7-CD45RO+ effector memory phenotype. However, the yield of T-cells isolated from PC lesions was on average 20-fold higher than that obtained from control prostates. Furthermore, there were differences between the prostate conditions regarding the percentage of T-cells expressing several activation markers and co-inhibitory receptors. In conclusion, many prostate-infiltrating T-cells express co-inhibitory receptors PD-1 and LAG-3, regardless of prostate condition. Despite the observed increase in counts and percentages of PD-1+ T-cells in PC, the concomitant demonstration of high percentage of PD-1+ T-cells in control prostates suggests that PD-1 may play a role in controlling the homeostasis of the prostate rather than in contributing to PC-associated immune-suppression.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in numerous important cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. They have been found to be aberrantly expressed in many types of human cancers. They can act as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and changes in their levels are associated with tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. miR-33a is an intronic miRNA embedded within SREBF2 that has been reported to have tumor suppressive properties in some cancers but has not been examined in prostate cancer. SREBF2 increases cholesterol and lipid levels both directly and via miR-33a action. The levels of SREBF2 and miR-33a are correlated in normal tissues by co-transcription from the same gene locus. Paradoxically, SREBF2 has been reported to be increased in prostate cancer, which would be predicted to increase miR-33a levels potentially leading to tumor suppression. We show here that miR-33a has tumor suppressive activities and is decreased in prostate cancer.

Our study employs Whole Genome DNA Sequence (WGS) data from tumor samples (n = 103) to comprehensively assess the role of the Knudson two hit genetic model in SCNA generation in prostate cancer. 64 recurrent regions of loss and gain were detected, of which 28 were novel, including regions of loss with more than 15% frequency at Chr4p15.2-p15.1 (15.53%), Chr6q27 (16.50%) and Chr18q12.3 (17.48%). Comprehensive mutation screens of genes, lincRNA encoding sequences, control regions and conserved domains within SCNAs demonstrated that a two-hit genetic model was supported in only a minor proportion of recurrent SCNA losses examined (15/40). We found that recurrent breakpoints and regions of inversion often occur within Knudson model SCNAs, leading to the identification of ZNF292 as a target gene for the deletion at 6q14.3-q15 and NKX3.1 as a two-hit target at 8p21.3-p21.2. The importance of alterations of lincRNA sequences was illustrated by the identification of a novel mutational hotspot at the KCCAT42, FENDRR, CAT1886 and STCAT2 loci at the 16q23.1-q24.3 loss. Our data confirm that the burden of SCNAs is predictive of biochemical recurrence, define nine individual regions that are associated with relapse, and highlight the possible importance of ion channel and G-protein coupled-receptor (GPCR) pathways in cancer development. We concluded that a two-hit genetic model accounts for about one third of SCNA indicating that mechanisms, such haploinsufficiency and epigenetic inactivation, account for the remaining SCNA losses.""","""['Niedzica Camacho', 'Peter Van Loo', 'Sandra Edwards', 'Jonathan D Kay', 'Lucy Matthews', 'Kerstin Haase', 'Jeremy Clark', 'Nening Dennis', 'Sarah Thomas', 'Barbara Kremeyer', 'Jorge Zamora', 'Adam P Butler', 'Gunes Gundem', 'Sue Merson', 'Hayley Luxton', 'Steve Hawkins', 'Mohammed Ghori', 'Luke Marsden', 'Adam Lambert', 'Katalin Karaszi', 'Gill Pelvender', 'Charlie E Massie', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Keiran Raine', 'David Jones', 'William J Howat', 'Steven Hazell', 'Naomi Livni', 'Cyril Fisher', 'Christopher Ogden', 'Pardeep Kumar', 'Alan Thompson', 'David Nicol', 'Erik Mayer', 'Tim Dudderidge', 'Yongwei Yu', 'Hongwei Zhang', 'Nimish C Shah', 'Vincent J Gnanapragasam;CRUK-ICGC Prostate Group;William Isaacs', 'Tapio Visakorpi', 'Freddie Hamdy', 'Dan Berney', 'Clare Verrill', 'Anne Y Warren', 'David C Wedge', 'Andrew G Lynch', 'Christopher S Foster', 'Yong Jie Lu', 'G Steven Bova', 'Hayley C Whitaker', 'Ultan McDermott', 'David E Neal', 'Rosalind Eeles', 'Colin S Cooper', 'Daniel S Brewer']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['Breast and prostate cancers harbor common somatic copy number alterations that consistently differ by race and are associated with survival.', 'Combining targeted sequencing and ultra-low-pass whole-genome sequencing for accurate somatic copy number alteration detection.', 'Low-cost and clinically applicable copy number profiling using repeat DNA.', 'Using SAAS-CNV to Detect and Characterize Somatic Copy Number Alterations in Cancer Genomes from Next Generation Sequencing and SNP Array Data.', 'Chromosomal deletions and tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Values of Gene Copy Number Alterations in Prostate Cancer.', 'Systematic integration of protein-affecting mutations, gene fusions, and copy number alterations into a comprehensive somatic mutational profile.', 'Chromosome-specific segment size alterations are determinants of prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'The architecture of clonal expansions in morphologically normal tissue from cancerous and non-cancerous prostates.', 'Study on the Mechanism of circRNA-0024103 Reducing Endothelial Cell Injury by Regulating miR-363/MMP-10.']"""

Patients and Methods We used data from 796,594 population-based English General Practice Patient Survey responders to explore the prevalence of self-reported diagnoses of cancer in the last 5 years among sexual minorities compared with heterosexual women and men. We analyzed data from 249,010 hospital-based English Cancer Patient Experience Survey responders with sexual orientation as a binary outcome, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth, Revision, diagnosis as covariate-38 different common and rarer cancers, with breast and prostate cancer as baseline categories for women and men, respectively-to examine whether people from sexual minorities are over- or under-represented among different cancer sites. For both analyses, we used logistic regression, stratified by sex and adjusted for age. Results A diagnosis of cancer in the past 5 years was more commonly reported by male General Practice Patient Survey responders who endorsed gay or bisexual orientation compared with heterosexual men (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.49; P < .001) without evidence of a difference between lesbian or bisexual compared with heterosexual women (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.37; P = .19). For most common and rarer cancer sites (30 of 33 in women, 28 of 32 in men), the odds of specific cancer site diagnosis among Cancer Patient Experience Survey respondents seemed to be independent of sexual orientation; however, there were notable differences in infection-related (HIV and human papillomavirus [HPV]) cancers. Gay or bisexual men were over-represented among men with Kaposi's sarcoma (OR, 48.2; 95% CI, 22.0 to 105.6), anal (OR, 15.5; 95% CI, 11.0 to 21.9), and penile cancer (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.9 to 3.7). Lesbian or bisexual women were over-represented among women with oropharyngeal cancer (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.0). Conclusion Large-scale evidence indicates that the distribution of cancer sites does not vary substantially by sexual orientation, with the exception of some HPV- and HIV-associated cancers.

Cellax polymeric conjugates consisting of carboxymethyl cellulose functionalized with PEG and hydrophobic anticancer drugs, such as cabazitaxel (coined Cellax-CBZ), have been shown to have high potency against several oncology targets, including prostate cancer. FNP, a robust method used to create nanoparticles through rapid mixing, has been used to encapsulate several hydrophobic drugs with block copolymer stabilizers, but has never been used to form nanoparticles from random copolymers, such as Cellax-CBZ. To assess the potential of using FNP to produce Cellax nanoparticles, parameters such as concentration, mixing rate, solvent ratios, and subsequent dilution were tested with a target nanoparticle size range of 60 nm. Under optimized solvent conditions, particles were formed that underwent a subsequent rearrangement to form nanoparticles of 60 nm diameter, independent of Cellax-CBZ polymer concentration. This intraparticle relaxation, without interparticle association, points to a delicate balance of hydrophobic/hydrophilic domains on the polymer backbone. These particles were stable over time, and the random amphiphilicity did not lead to interparticle attractions, which would compromise the stability and corresponding narrow size distribution required for parenteral injection. The amphiphilic nature of these conjugates allows them to be processed into nanoparticles for sustained drug release and improved tumor selectivity. Preferred candidates were evaluated for plasma stability and cytotoxicity against the PC3 prostate cancer cell line in vitro. These parameters are important when assessing nanoparticle safety and for estimating potential efficacy, respectively. The optimal formulations showed plasma stability profiles consistent with long circulating nanoparticles, and cytotoxicity comparable to that of free CBZ. This study demonstrates that FNP is a promising technology for development of Cellax nanoparticles.""","""['Joseph Bteich', 'Simon A McManus', 'Mark J Ernsting', 'Mohammed Z Mohammed', ""Robert K Prud'homme"", 'Kenneth K Sokoll']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Cabazitaxel-conjugated nanoparticles for docetaxel-resistant and bone metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Current Update of a Carboxymethylcellulose-PEG Conjugate Platform for Delivery of Insoluble Cytotoxic Agents to Tumors.', 'Synthetic modification of carboxymethylcellulose and use thereof to prepare a nanoparticle forming conjugate of docetaxel for enhanced cytotoxicity against cancer cells.', 'Preclinical pharmacokinetic, biodistribution, and anti-cancer efficacy studies of a docetaxel-carboxymethylcellulose nanoparticle in mouse models.', 'Application of flash nanoprecipitation to fabricate poorly water-soluble drug nanoparticles.', 'Encapsulation of PI3K Inhibitor LY294002 within Polymer Nanoparticles Using Ion Pairing Flash Nanoprecipitation.', 'Single-Step Self-Assembly of Zein-Honey-Chitosan Nanoparticles for Hydrophilic Drug Incorporation by Flash Nanoprecipitation.', 'Unique Properties of Surface-Functionalized Nanoparticles for Bio-Application: Functionalization Mechanisms and Importance in Application.', 'Towards principled design of cancer nanomedicine to accelerate clinical translation.', 'Flash Technology-Based Self-Assembly in Nanoformulation: From Fabrication to Biomedical Applications.']"""

Similarly, obese conditions increased CCL2 and COX-2 expression, as well as PGE2 levels in prostate cancer cells. COX-2 inhibition resulted in lower expression of obesity-induced TAM markers.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of kisspeptin‑mediated signaling in the inhibition of cancer cell migration and invasion have yet to be elucidated. The present in vitro cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays and in vivo experimental metastasis studies demonstrated that kisspeptin‑induced eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase 2 (EIF2AK2) activation suppressed the metastatic capabilities of several types of cancer cells. Kisspeptin was revealed to inhibit the migratory and invasive abilities of highly metastatic breast SK‑BR‑3, prostatic PC‑3 and colorectal adenocarcinoma LoVo human cancer cell lines, whereas its inhibitory effects were abolished following the silencing of EIF2AK2 expression using RNA interference. Similarly, kisspeptin failed to inhibit the migration and invasion of mouse embryonic fibroblasts following the deletion of the EIF2AK2 gene. Furthermore, kisspeptin was demonstrated to activate Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA)‑dependent signaling, and to phosphorylate EIF2AK2 via RhoA‑mediated pathways in various cancer cells. In addition, results obtained from nude mice bearing LoVo‑derived xenograft tumors revealed that kisspeptin inhibited tumor growth through an EIF2AK2‑dependent mechanism, and an in vivo metastasis assay identified kisspeptin‑activated EIF2AK2 signaling as critical for the suppression of distant metastasis.

Hypoxia is a common feature in prostate tumors and is known to drive disease progression and metastasis. It is, therefore, a rational therapeutic strategy to directly target hypoxic tumor cells in an attempt to improve treatment for this disease. Here we tested OCT1002 alone and in combination with standard-of-care agents in hypoxic models of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   The effect of OCT1002 on tumor growth and vasculature was measured using murine PC3 xenograft and dorsal skin fold (DSF) window chamber models. The effects of abiraterone, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel, both singly and in combination with OCT1002, were also compared.  Results:   The hypoxia-targeting ability of OCT1002 effectively controls PC3 tumor growth. The effect was evident for at least 42 days after exposure to a single dose (30 mg/kg) and was comparable to, or better than, drugs currently used in the clinic. In DSF experiments OCT1002 caused vascular collapse in the PC3 tumors and inhibited the revascularization seen in controls. In this model OCT1002 also enhanced the anti-tumor effects of abiraterone, cabazitaxel, and docetaxel; an effect which was accompanied by a more prolonged reduction in tumor vasculature density.  Conclusions:   These studies provide the first evidence that OCT1002 can be an effective agent in treating hypoxic, castrate-resistant prostate tumors, either singly or in combination with established chemotherapeutics for prostate cancer.""","""['Heather Nesbitt', 'Jenny Worthington', 'Rachel J Errington', 'Laurence H Patterson', 'Paul J Smith', 'Stephanie R McKeown', 'Declan J McKenna']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Targeting DNA topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A) in the hypoxic tumour microenvironment using unidirectional hypoxia-activated prodrugs (uHAPs).', 'Targeting Hypoxic Prostate Tumors Using the Novel Hypoxia-Activated Prodrug OCT1002 Inhibits Expression of Genes Associated with Malignant Progression.', 'Docetaxel/cabazitaxel and fatty acid binding protein 5 inhibitors produce synergistic inhibition of prostate cancer growth.', 'Lack of combination effects of soy isoflavones and taxane chemotherapy of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'In vitro radiosensitization of breast cancer with hypoxia-activated prodrugs.', '3D-printed lightweight dorsal skin fold chambers from PEEK reduce chamber-related animal distress.', 'Targeting DNA topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A) in the hypoxic tumour microenvironment using unidirectional hypoxia-activated prodrugs (uHAPs).', 'Hypoxia signaling: Challenges and opportunities for cancer therapy.', 'Hypoxia-activated prodrugs and redox-responsive nanocarriers.']"""

The known anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic actions of the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] are mediated through binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Here, we report on the unexpected finding that stable knockdown of VDR expression in the human breast and prostate cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and PC3, strongly induces cell apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation in vitro. Implantation of these VDR knockdown cells into the mammary fat pad (MDA-MB-231), subcutaneously (PC3) or intra-tibially (both cell lines) in immune-incompetent nude mice resulted in reduced tumor growth associated with increased apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation compared with controls. These growth-retarding effects of VDR knockdown occur in the presence and absence of vitamin D and are independent of whether cells were grown in bone or soft tissues. Transcriptome analysis of VDR knockdown and non-target control cell lines demonstrated that loss of the VDR was associated with significant attenuation in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In particular, cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin protein levels were reduced with a corresponding downregulation of downstream genes such as Axin2, Cyclin D1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-8. Stabilization of β-catenin using the GSK-3β inhibitor BIO partly reversed the growth-retarding effects of VDR knockdown. Our results indicate that the unliganded VDR possesses hitherto unknown functions to promote breast and prostate cancer growth, which appear to be operational not only within but also outside the bone environment. These novel functions contrast with the known anti-proliferative nuclear actions of the liganded VDR and may represent targets for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in breast and prostate cancer.""","""['Yu Zheng', 'Trupti Trivedi', 'Ruby Cy Lin', 'Colette Fong-Yee', 'Rick Nolte', 'Jeline Manibo', 'Yunzhao Chen', 'Musharraf Hossain', 'Konstantin Horas', 'Colin Dunstan', 'Hong Zhou', 'Markus J Seibel']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Bone Res""","""['The vitamin D receptor is involved in the regulation of human breast cancer cell growth via a ligand-independent function in cytoplasm.', 'Vitamin D-induced vitamin D receptor expression induces tamoxifen sensitivity in MCF-7 stem cells via suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Vitamin D3-dependent VDR signaling delays ron-mediated breast tumorigenesis through suppression of β-catenin activity.', 'Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma?', 'Targets of vitamin D receptor signaling in the mammary gland.', 'ESS2 controls prostate cancer progression through recruitment of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1.', 'Myeloid vitamin D receptor regulates Paneth cells and microbial homeostasis.', 'Quercetin activates vitamin D receptor and ameliorates breast cancer induced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.', 'Vitamin D receptor prevents tumour development by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in human colorectal cancer.', 'Bone Metastases of Diverse Primary Origin Frequently Express the VDR (Vitamin D Receptor) and CYP24A1.']"""

Human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP cells were routinely thawed, cultured and passaged. Actively growing cells were divided into batches. Cells in the control group were grown under 5% CO2 + 20% O2, and those in the hypoxia group were grown under 5% CO2 + 1% O2. The experiments were performed after 12, 24 and 72 h under each growth condition. The percentages of CD13+ cells were detected by flow cytometry, the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF was detected by western blot analysis, the cell proliferation rate was detected by the MTT assay, and the apoptotic rate was detected by flow cytometry. The results showed that the percentage of CD133+ cells, and the expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF for the cells in the hypoxia group increased gradually from 12 to 24, to 72 h, while there were no equivalent changes in the control group. Cell proliferation in the two groups increased gradually from 12 to 24, to 72 h, but was significantly higher at all time-points in the hypoxia group (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in terms of the amount of apoptotic cells at any of the three different time-points in either group, but the apoptotic cells in the hypoxia group were significantly less than those in the control group at each time-point, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05).

The present study investigates a possible association between chronic inflammation and the development of epithelial neoplasia in the prostate. Needle biopsy specimens were obtained from patients with serum prostate-specific antigen levels >4 ng/ml, evaluated for morphological findings, and immunostained for Bcl-2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Bcl-2 is a survival protein that appears to lie at a nodal point in pathways involved in cell survival, carcinogenesis, and development of therapeutic resistance in certain cancer types. Similarly, PCNA is a critical protein for DNA replication, repair of DNA damage, chromatin structure maintenance, chromosome segregation and cell-cycle progression. The association between these two proteins was examined in prostate tissues with and without chronic inflammation, as well as tissues with and without evidence of neoplastic changes. Of the 106 needle biopsies examined, 18% exhibited atrophy with inflammation. Proliferative inflammatory atrophy/post-atrophic hyperplasia were observed in 42%, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) in 8%, prostatic adenocarcinoma in 11%, and 2% had atypical acinar proliferation suspicious for malignancy. A total of 36 specimens were stained for Bcl-2 and PCNA. Bcl-2 was expressed widely in inflammatory and epithelial tissue; however, more intense expression was observed in the areas of chronic inflammation, predominantly in infiltrating immune cells. The highest proliferation index was observed in the epithelia of HGPIN and cancer. An inverse correlation between the expression of Bcl-2 and the expression of PCNA was observed in the epithelium. The areas of chronic inflammation were associated with increased Bcl-2 expression, whereas the highly proliferative epithelium minimally expressed Bcl-2. These results suggest that Bcl-2 alters the phenotype of particular epithelial cells with a gain in neoplastic characteristics, leading to a likely precursor that may later progress into HGPIN and cancer.""","""['Michael Glover', 'Shardul Soni', 'Qinghu Ren', 'Gregory T Maclennan', 'Pingfu Fu', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Correlation of increased apoptosis and proliferation with development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in ventral prostate of the Noble rat.', 'The influence of chronic inflammation in prostatic carcinogenesis: a 5-year followup study.', 'Morphological transition of proliferative inflammatory atrophy to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer in human prostate.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', 'Histological markers of risk and the role of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Eriochloa villosa Alleviates Progression of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in vitro and in vivo.', 'High expression of ladinin-1 (LAD1) predicts adverse outcomes: a new candidate docetaxel resistance gene for prostatic cancer (PCa).', 'Impact of e-cigarettes on colonic mucosa and the role of recovery: involvement of oxidative and inflammatory pathway.', 'Korean Red Ginseng and Korean black ginseng extracts, JP5 and BG1, prevent hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation induced by environmental heat stress.', 'Histoprotective Effect of Essential Oil from Citrus aurantifolia in Testosterone-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Rat.']"""

LNCaP cells were treated with QI plus testosterone propionate (TP), and androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) expression levels were assessed by Western blotting. To induce BPH, the rats were subjected to a daily subcutaneous injection of TP (3 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. The rats in treatment group were orally gavaged with QI (150 mg/kg) together with the TP injection. In-vitro studies showed that TP-induced increases in AR and PSA expression in LNCaP cells were reduced by QI treatment. In BPH-model rats, the prostate weight, testosterone in serum, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration and 5α-reductase type 2 mRNA expression in prostate tissue were significantly reduced following the treatment with QI. TP-induced prostatic hyperplasia and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin D1 were significantly attenuated in QI-treated rats. In addition, QI induced apoptosis by up-regulating caspase-3 and -9 activity and decreasing the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) ratio in prostate tissues of BPH rats. Further investigation showed that TP-induced activation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) was reduced by QI administration.

Methods:   In vivo dosimetry was incorporated in the clinical routine during high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy at Aarhus University Hospital. The dosimetry was performed with a radioluminescent crystal positioned in a dedicated brachytherapy needle in the prostate. The dose rate was recorded every 50-100 ms during treatment and analyzed retrospectively. The measured total delivered dose and dose rates for each dwell position with dwell times >0.7 s were compared with expected values. Furthermore, the distance between the source and dosimeter, which was derived from the measured dose rates, was compared with expected values. The measured dose rate pattern in each needle was used to determine the most likely position of the needle relative to the dosimeter.  Results:   In total, 305 needles and 3239 dwell positions were analyzed based on 20 treatments. The measured total doses differed from the expected values by -4.7 ± 8.4% (1SD) with range (-17% to 12%). It was possible to determine needle shifts for 304 out of 305 needles.

Center D (n=75) applied the largest PTV margins of 8 mm. The study protocol provided identical anorectal dose constraints, and local protocols were applied for further treatment optimization. Anorectal dose-surface histograms were compared by applying t tests. Rectal complaints during follow-up (6 months to 4 years) were compared in a generalized linear model, adjusting for age, follow-up, treatment arm, and hormone therapy.  Results:   Favorable anorectal dose distributions were found for center B (MRI delineation) and center C (ERB application) as compared with centers A and D. These were associated with significantly lower incidences of patient-reported complaints of rectal incontinence, use of incontinence pads, and rectal discomfort in these centers. Furthermore, lower incidences of increased stool frequency (≥4 per day) and mucous loss were observed for center C.  Conclusions:   Despite comparable IG-IMRT techniques and predefined dose constraints, pronounced differences in dose distributions and toxicity rates were observed. MRI delineation and ERB application were associated with favorable rectal dose parameters and toxicity profiles, whereas a 2- to 3-mm difference in PTV margins did not translate into observed differences. We conclude that choices for treatment optimization of IG-IMRT are important and clinically relevant for patients since these affect symptoms experienced in daily life.""","""['Ruud C Wortel', 'Wilma D Heemsbergen', 'Robert Jan Smeenk', 'Marnix G Witte', 'Stijn D G Krol', 'Floris J Pos', 'Luca Incrocci']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In Regard to Wortel et\xa0al.', 'In Reply to Güngör et\xa0al.', 'Acute toxicity after image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy compared to 3D conformal radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'Hydrogel Spacer Prospective Multicenter Randomized Controlled Pivotal Trial: Dosimetric\xa0and Clinical Effects of Perirectal Spacer Application in Men Undergoing Prostate\xa0Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiation\xa0Therapy.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological consequences of computed tomography-guided adaptive strategies for intensity modulated radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Rectal retractor in prostate radiotherapy: pros and cons.', 'Patient reported toxicity and quality of life after hypofractionated high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy for intermediate- and high risk prostate cancer.', 'Spatial and dosimetric evaluation of residual distortions of prostate and seminal vesicle bed after image-guided definitive and postoperative radiotherapy of prostate cancer with endorectal balloon.', 'Dosimetric Impact of the Positional Imaging Frequency for Hypofractionated Prostate Radiotherapy - A Voxel-by-Voxel Analysis.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices in managing prostate motion: a\xa0systematic review.']"""

A prospective, single-arm, translational study using targeted multiregion prostate biopsies was carried out to study genomic and T-cell ITH in clinically high-risk PC aiming to identify drivers and potential therapeutic strategies.  Patients and methods:   Forty-nine men with elevated prostate-specific antigen and multiparametric-magnetic resonance imaging detected PC underwent image-guided multiregion transperineal biopsy. Seventy-nine tumour regions from 25 patients with PC underwent sequencing, analysis of mutations, copy number and neoepitopes combined with tumour infiltrating T-cell subset quantification.  Results:   We demonstrated extensive somatic nucleotide variation and somatic copy number alteration heterogeneity in high-risk PC. Overall, the mutational burden was low (0.93/Megabase), but two patients had hypermutation, with loss of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, MSH2 and MSH6. Somatic copy number alteration burden was higher in patients with metastatic hormone-naive PC (mHNPC) than in those with high-risk localised PC (hrlPC), independent of Gleason grade. Mutations were rarely ubiquitous and mutational frequencies were similar for mHNPC and hrlPC patients. Enrichment of focal 3q26.2 and 3q21.3, regions containing putative metastasis drivers, was seen in mHNPC patients. We found evidence of parallel evolution with three separate clones containing activating mutations of β-catenin in a single patient. We demonstrated extensive intratumoural and intertumoural T-cell heterogeneity and high inflammatory infiltrate in the MMR-deficient (MMRD) patients and the patient with parallel evolution of β-catenin. Analysis of all patients with activating Wnt/β-catenin mutations demonstrated a low CD8+/FOXP3+ ratio, a potential surrogate marker of immune evasion.  Conclusions:   The PROGENY (PROstate cancer GENomic heterogeneitY) study provides a diagnostic platform suitable for studying tumour ITH. Genetic aberrations in clinically high-risk PC are associated with altered patterns of immune infiltrate in tumours. Activating mutations of Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway or MMRD could be considered as potential biomarkers for immunomodulation therapies.

We conducted a cohort study to determine whether patients with PC have an increased risk of AMD.  Patients and methods:   Data were collected from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database for the 1999-2010 period. The study PC cohort comprised 22 084 patients aged ≥18 years with a first diagnosis of PC. The comparison cohort consisted of age-, occupation-, and urbanization level-matched patients at a ratio of 1 : 1. The primary outcome was the incidence of AMD, which was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and proportional hazards modeling.  Results:   The mean follow-up periods (standard deviation) for the patients with AMD in the age-, occupation-, and urbanization level-matched PC cohort and non-PC cohorts were 4.69 (2.90) and 5.51 (2.82) years. The mean age of the PC cohort was 73.9 years and that of the non-PC cohort was 73.2 years, with approximately 85.9% of the patients aged >65 years. The PC cohort had a higher risk of AMD than did the propensity score-matched non-PC cohort with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.25 (95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.39). Compared with PC cohort receiving no injection hormone therapy, the PC cohort receiving injection hormone therapy had a lower risk of AMD (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.76).

However, patients usually develop disease progression after initial treatment. This prospective phase I/II study assessed re-treatment safety and efficacy of up to six additional radium-223 injections.  Patients and methods:   Patients had castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases and six initial radium-223 injections with no on-treatment bone progression; all had subsequent radiologic or clinical progression. Concomitant agents were allowed at investigator discretion, excluding chemotherapy and initiation of new abiraterone or enzalutamide. The primary endpoint was safety; additional exploratory endpoints included time to radiographic bone progression, time to total alkaline phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen progression, radiographic progression-free survival, overall survival, time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE), SSE-free survival, and time to pain progression.  Results:   Among 44 patients, 29 (66%) received all six re-treatment injections. Median time from end of initial radium-223 treatment was 6 months. Forty-one (93%) reported ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event. No grade 4-5 hematologic treatment-emergent adverse events occurred. Only one (2%) patient had radiographic bone progression; eight (18%) had radiographic soft tissue tumor progression (three lymph node and five visceral metastases). Median times to total alkaline phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen progression were not reached and 2.2 months, respectively. Median radiographic progression-free survival was 9.9 months (12.8-month maximum follow-up). Five (11%) patients died and eight (18%) experienced first SSEs. Median overall survival, time to first SSE, and SSE-free survival were not reached. Five (14%) of 36 evaluable patients (baseline worst pain score ≤7) had pain progression. After 2 years of follow-up, 28 (64%) patients died, and the median overall survival was 24.4 months.  Conclusions:   Re-treatment with a second course of six radium-223 injections after disease progression is well tolerated, with minimal hematologic toxicity and low radiographic bone progression rates in this small study with limited follow-up.

Seventy-eight men with untreated PCa received 3 T mpMR scans prior to radical prostatectomy. Cancerous regions were outlined, graded, and cancer amount estimated on whole-mount histology. Regions of interest were manually drawn on T2 -weighted images based on histopathology. Logistic regression was used to identify optimal combinations of parameters for the peripheral zone and transition zone to separate: (i) benign from malignant tissues; (ii) Gleason score (GS) ≤3 + 3 disease from ≥GS3 + 4; and (iii) ≤ GS3 + 4 from ≥GS4 + 3 cancers. The performance of the models was assessed using repeated fourfold cross-validation. Additionally, the performance of the logistic regression models created under the assumption that one or more modality has not been acquired was evaluated. Logistic regression models yielded areas under the curve (AUCs) of 1.0 and 0.99 when separating benign from malignant tissues in the peripheral zone and the transition zone, respectively. Within the peripheral zone, combining choline, maximal enhancement slope, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and citrate measures for separating ≤GS3 + 3 from ≥GS3 + 4 PCa yielded AUC = 0.84. Combining creatine, choline, and washout slope yielded AUC = 0.81 for discriminating ≤GS3 + 4 from ≥GS4 + 3 disease. Within the transition zone, combining washout slope, ADC, and creatine yielded AUC = 0.93 for discriminating ≤GS3 + 3 and ≥GS3 + 4 cancers. When separating ≤GS3 + 4 from ≥GS4 + 3 PCa, combining choline and washout slope yielded AUC = 0.92. MpMRI provides excellent separation between benign tissues and PCa, and across PCa tissues of different aggressiveness. The final models prominently feature spectroscopy and DCE-derived metrics, underlining their value within a comprehensive mpMRI examination.""","""['Olga Starobinets', 'Jeffry P Simko', 'Kyle Kuchinsky', 'John Kornak', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Kirsten L Greene', 'John Kurhanewicz', 'Susan M Noworolski']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['Identification of prostate cancer using multiparametric MR imaging characteristics of prostate tissues referenced to whole mount histopathology.', 'Prostate cancer lesion detection, volume quantification and high-grade cancer differentiation using cancer risk maps derived from multiparametric MRI with histopathology as the reference standard.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Discriminating Low-Grade From High-Grade Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for transition zone prostate cancer: essential findings, limitations, and future directions.', 'Developments in proton MR spectroscopic imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Identification of prostate cancer using multiparametric MR imaging characteristics of prostate tissues referenced to whole mount histopathology.', 'Absolute choline tissue concentration mapping for prostate cancer localization and characterization using 3D 1 H MRSI without water-signal suppression.', 'Three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: a complementary tool to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the identification of aggressive prostate cancer at 3.0T.', 'Diagnosis of transition zone prostate cancer by multiparametric MRI: added value of MR spectroscopic imaging with sLASER volume selection.']"""

Patients and methods:   We used baseline data (questionnaires completed after treatment information was provided but before treatment) of 426 patients with newly diagnosed localised prostate cancer who participated (87% response rate) in a prospective, longitudinal, multicentre study. Patients' pretreatment perceptions of differences in adverse outcomes of treatments were compared to those based on the literature. We used univariate and multivariate linear regression to identify correlates of misperceptions.  Results:   About two-thirds (68%, n = 211) of the patients did not understand that the risk of disease recurrence is comparable between RP and RT. More than half of the patients did not comprehend that RP patients are at greater risk of urinary incontinence (65%, n = 202) and erectile dysfunction (61%, n = 190), and less at risk of bowel problems (53%, n = 211) compared to RT patients. Many patients overestimated the risk of requiring definitive treatment following AS (45%, n = 157) and did not understand that mortality rates following AS, RP, and RT are comparable (80%, n = 333).

Rectal displacement devices (RDDs) allow for improved rectal dosimetry during prostate cancer treatment. This study used KIM to perform a preliminary investigation of prostate intrafraction motion observed in patients with an RDD in place.  Methods:   Ten patients with intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer were treated with a Rectafix RDD in place during two boost fractions of 9.5-10 Gy delivered using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) on Clinac iX and Truebeam linacs. Two-dimensional kV projections were acquired during treatment. KIM software was used following treatment to determine the displacement of the prostate over time. The displacement results were analyzed to determine the percentage of treatment time the prostate spent within 1 mm, between 1 and 2 mm, between 2 and 3 mm and greater than 3 mm from its initial position.  Results:   KIM successfully measured displacement for 19 prostate stereotactic boost fractions. The prostate was within 1 mm of its initial position for 84.8%, 1-2 mm for 14%, 2-3 mm 1.2% and ≥3 mm only 0.4% of the treatment time.

Although tumour-derived exosomes harbour immunosuppressive characteristics, they also carry tumour antigens and thus potentially contribute to immune activation. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of prostate cancer exosomes on tumour antigen cross-presentation. DU145 cells, transduced with shRNA to knockdown Rab27a (DU145KD) that inhibits exosome secretion, triggered significantly stronger tumour-antigen-specific T cell responses when loaded onto dendritic cells (DC) than control DU145 cells. Enhanced T cell response was prevented by adding purified exogenous DU145 exosomes to DU145KD cells, demonstrating that the dominant effect of tumour exosomes is immunosuppression and not antigen delivery. CD8+ T cell responses were impaired via exosomal regulation of DC function; exosomes triggered the expression of CD73, an ecto-5-nucleotidase responsible for AMP to adenosine hydrolysis, on DC. CD73 induction on DC that constitutively express CD39 resulted in an ATP-dependent inhibition of TNFα- and IL-12-production. We identified exosomal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a potential driver of CD73 induction, as inhibition of PGE2 receptors significantly reduced exosome-dependent CD73 induction. The results reveal a hitherto unknown suppression of DC function via exosomal PGE2, adding a new element to tumour exosome-immune cell cross-talk.

Features such as Haralick and Gabor can provide a multi-scale representation of the original image by extracting measurements across differently sized neighborhoods. While these multi-scale features are effective, on large-scale digital pathological images, the process of extracting these features is computationally expensive. Moreover for different problems, different scales and neighborhood sizes may be more or less important and thus a large number of features extracted might end up being redundant. In this paper, we present a Discriminative Scale learning (DiScrn) approach that attempts to automatically identify the distinctive scales at which features are able to best separate cancerous from non-cancerous regions on both radiologic and digital pathology tissue images. To evaluate the efficacy of our approach, our approach was employed to detect presence and extent of prostate cancer on a total of 60 MRI and digitized histopathology images.

In DCE-MRI, an arterial input function (AIF) is often distorted by pulsated inflow effect and noise. A population-based AIF (pAIF) has high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but cannot incorporate the individual variation. AIF variation is mainly induced by variation in cardiac output and blood volume of the individuals, which can be detected by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) during the first passage and the amplitude of AIF, respectively. Thus pAIF scaled in time and amplitude fitting to the individual AIF may serve as a high SNR AIF incorporating the individual variation. The proposed method was validated using DCE-MRI images of 18 prostate cancer patients. Root mean square error (RMSE) of pAIF from individual AIFs was 0.88±0.48mM (mean±SD), but it was reduced to 0.25±0.11mM after pAIF modification using the proposed method (p<0.0001).""","""['Harrison Kim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Reproducibility of the aortic input function (AIF) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of the kidneys in a volunteer study.', 'A comparison of two methods for estimating DCE-MRI parameters via individual and cohort based AIFs in prostate cancer: a step towards practical implementation.', 'Quantitative pharmacokinetic analysis of prostate cancer DCE-MRI at 3T: comparison of two arterial input functions on cancer detection with digitized whole mount histopathological validation.', 'Use of Indicator Dilution Principle to Evaluate Accuracy of Arterial Input Function Measured With Low-Dose Ultrafast Prostate Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI.', 'Assessment of repeatability and treatment response in early phase clinical trials using DCE-MRI: comparison of parametric analysis using MR- and CT-derived arterial input functions.', 'Quantitative renal magnetic resonance imaging: magnetic resonance urography.', 'Disposable point-of-care portable perfusion phantom for quantitative DCE-MRI.', 'Effects of artery input function on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for determining grades of gliomas.', 'Portable Perfusion Phantom Offers Quantitative Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Accurate Prostate Cancer Grade Stratification: A Pilot Study.', 'Accurate Therapeutic Response Assessment of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Using Quantitative Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging With a Point-of-Care Perfusion Phantom: A Pilot Study.']"""

Materials and methods:   The study was conducted on 727 patients treated from April 2009 to October 2016. Patients received 42.4 Gy in 16 daily fractions (2.65 Gy per fraction). A boost was only administered in cases with grade (G) 3 primary tumor and close or positive margins. Acute and late toxicity was assessed prospectively during and after hypo-RT, based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the onset of acute skin toxicity (≥ G2) in the whole study population, and the impact of trastuzumab on the onset of acute skin (≥ G2) or cardiac toxicity in the subgroup of 176 patients given chemotherapy.  Results:   A total of 176 patients received chemotherapy with anthracycline and taxane, and 51 (29%) of them were also treated with trastuzumab. Acute G1, G2, and G3 skin toxicity occurred, respectively, in 56.8%, 27.3%, and 1.1% of the patients given chemotherapy alone, and in 64.7%, 19.6%, and 0% of those given trastuzumab as well. Among the patients given chemotherapy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) toxicity developed with a severity of G1 (LVEF < 60%-50%) in 12 (6.8%) patients, G2 (LVEF < 50%-40%) in 2 (1.1%) patients, and G3 (LVEF < 40%) in 1 (0.6%) patient. Among the patients also given trastuzumab, 7 (13.7%) patients had G1 LVEF toxicity, and 1 (2%) patient had G2 LVEF toxicity. We found that patients given trastuzumab were at higher risk of cardiac toxicity ≥ G1 (odds ratio, 4.3; P = .01), and at lower risk of acute skin toxicity ≥ G2 (odds ratio, 0.4; P = .03) than patients given chemotherapy alone.

Methods:   Patients with BD (n = 14,137; mean age, 44.2 ± 12.5 years; male patients, 32.4%) without known previous cancer were selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Database between 2007 and 2014.

Poor execution of a planned treatment could have significant clinical impact, as high doses are delivered in seconds, and mistakes in an individual fraction cannot be easily rectified. Given that most potential errors in HDR brachytherapy ultimately lead to a geographical miss, a more direct approach to verification of correct treatment delivery is to directly monitor the position of the source throughout the treatment. In this work, we report on the clinical implementation of our treatment verification system that uniquely combines the 2D source-tracking capability with 2D pretreatment imaging, using a single flat panel detector (FPD).  Methods and materials:   The clinical brachytherapy treatment couch was modified to allow integration of the FPD into the couch. This enabled the patient to be set up in the brachytherapy bunker in a position that closely matched that at treatment planning imaging. An anteroposterior image was acquired of the patient immediately before treatment delivery and was assessed by the Radiation Oncologist online, to reestablish the positions of the catheters relative to the prostate. Assessment of catheter positions was performed in the left-right and superior-inferior directions along the entire catheter length and throughout the treatment volume. Source tracking was then performed during treatment delivery, and the measured position of the source dwells were directly compared to the treatment plan for verification.  Results:   The treatment verification system was integrated into the clinical environment without significant change to workflow. Two patient cases are presented in this work to provide clinical examples of this system, which is now in routine use for all patient treatments in our clinic. The catheter positions were visualized relative to the prostate, immediately before treatment delivery. For one of the patient cases presented in this work, they agreed with the treatment plan on average by 1.5 mm and were identifiable as a predominantly inferior shift. The source tracking was performed during treatment delivery, and for the same case, the mean deviation from the planned dwell positions was 1.9 mm (max = 4.9 mm) for 280 positions across all catheters.  Conclusion:   We have implemented our noninvasive treatment verification system based on an FPD in the clinical environment. The device is integrated into a patient treatment couch, and the process is now included in the routine clinical treatment procedure with minor impact on workflow. The system which combines both 2D pretreatment imaging and HDR 2D source tracking provides a range of information that can be used for comprehensive treatment verification. The system has the potential to meaningfully improve safety standards by allowing widespread adoption of routine treatment verification in HDR brachytherapy.""","""['Ryan L Smith', 'Max Hanlon', 'Vanessa Panettieri', 'Jeremy L Millar', 'Bronwyn Matheson', 'Annette Haworth', 'Rick D Franich']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['A method for verification of treatment delivery in HDR prostate brachytherapy using a flat panel detector for both imaging and source tracking.', 'The evaluation of a 2D diode array in ""magic phantom"" for use in high dose rate brachytherapy pretreatment quality assurance.', 'Source position verification and dosimetry in HDR brachytherapy using an EPID.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Investigation of in vivo source tracking error thresholds for interstitial and intra-cavitary high-dose-rate cervical brachytherapy.', 'HDR prostate brachytherapy plan robustness and its effect on in-vivo source tracking error thresholds: A multi-institutional study.', 'In vivo dosimetry in brachytherapy: Requirements and future directions for research, development, and clinical practice.', 'External Validation of a Predictive Model of Urethral Strictures for Prostate Patients Treated With HDR Brachytherapy Boost.']"""

The purpose of this paper is to consider the technical requirements for using DEA for plan assessment. Design/methodology/approach In total, 41 prostate treatment plans were retrospectively analysed using the DEA method. The authors investigate the impact of DEA weight restrictions with reference to the ability to differentiate plan performance at a level of clinical significance. Patient geometry influences plan quality and the authors compare differing approaches for managing patient geometry within the DEA method. Findings The input-oriented DEA method is the method of choice when performing plan analysis using the key undesirable plan metrics as the DEA inputs. When considering multiple inputs, it is necessary to constrain the DEA input weights in order to identify potential plan improvements at a level of clinical significance. All tested approaches for the consideration of patient geometry yielded consistent results. Research limitations/implications This work is based on prostate plans and individual recommendations would therefore need to be validated for other treatment sites. Notwithstanding, the method that requires both optimised DEA weights according to clinical significance and appropriate accounting for patient geometric factors is universally applicable. Practical implications DEA can potentially be used during treatment plan development to guide the planning process or alternatively used retrospectively for treatment plan quality audit. Social implications DEA is independent of the planning system platform and therefore has the potential to be used for multi-institutional quality audit. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is the first published examination of the optimal approach in the use of DEA for radiotherapy treatment plan assessment.""","""['John Simpson', 'Andrea Raith', 'Paul Rouse', 'Matthias Ehrgott']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Health Care Qual Assur""","""['Quality assessment for VMAT prostate radiotherapy planning based on data envelopment analysis.', 'A DVH-guided IMRT optimization algorithm for automatic treatment planning and adaptive radiotherapy replanning.', 'Multi-GPU implementation of a VMAT treatment plan optimization algorithm.', ""Clinician's guide to prostate IMRT plan assessment and optimisation."", 'Plan quality in radiotherapy treatment planning - Review of the factors and challenges.', 'A Cohort Study of the Relationship between Active Collaboration and Operational Efficiency in Japanese Public Health Institutions.']"""

The objective of this study was to update a large Scandinavian single-center AS cohort. Furthermore, the use of curative treatment and subsequent risk of biochemical recurrence were investigated and compared in men with very low-risk, low-risk and intermediate-risk PCa in the cohort.  Materials and methods:   In total, 451 men were followed on AS and monitored with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests, digital rectal examinations and rebiopsies. Recommendation of curative treatment was based on protocolled and predefined risk of progression criteria. Biochemical recurrence was defined as PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy and PSA nadir +2 ng/ml after radiotherapy.  Results:   Altogether, 34% were defined with very low-risk PCa, 40% with low-risk PCa and 24% with intermediate-risk PCa. The median follow-up was 5.1 years. The estimated 5 year curatively intended treatment-free survival was 60.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 54.8-66.2%], with no statistically significant difference between men with very low-risk, low-risk or intermediate-risk PCa. The 5 year biochemical recurrence-free survival was 92.3% (95% CI 87.4-97.2), again with no difference between men with very low-risk, low-risk and intermediate-risk PCa.  Conclusion:   AS for very low- to low-risk localized PCa is feasible and safe within the short to intermediate time frame.

Dendrimers were synthesized on a polylysine core and bore either native GnRH (1, 2, and 5) or lipid-modified GnRH (3 and 4). Compound 3, which bore a lipidic moiety in a branched tetramer structure, showed approximately 10-fold higher permeability and metabolic stability and 39 times higher antitumor activity against hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells (DU145) relative to triptorelin. In gonadotropin-release experiments, dendrimer 3 was shown to be the most potent construct. Dendrimer 3 showed similar luteinizing hormone (LH)-release activity to triptorelin in mice.

Patients and methods:   This was a prospective study in which 36 patients with high-risk prostate cancer were included. The criteria for inclusion were biopsy-proven prostate cancer with a serum prostate specific antigen of at least 20 and/or Gleason's score of at least 8. Each patient then underwent both gallium-68 (Ga)-PSMA PET/computed tomography (CT) and mpMRI including diffusion-weighted whole-body imaging with background body signal suppression within an interval of 1 week and both modalities were compared for staging of primary disease, lymph node, and distant metastasis.  Results:   The median age of the 36 patients included was 65 years (range: 44-80 years) and the median prostate specific antigen was 94.3 ng/ml (range: 20-19005 ng/ml). Concordance for localization of primary on Ga-PSMA PET/CT and MRI was observed in 19/36 (52.7%) patients. Concurrence for T staging on Ga-PSMA and MRI was observed in 58.3% of patients. Ga-PSMA PET/CT detected higher numbers of patients with regional (29) and nonregional (15) lymph nodes in comparison with MRI (20 and 5, respectively). Concurrence for regional and nonregional lymph node staging was observed in 72.2% of patients. Additional sites of metastatic disease reported on Ga-PSMA PET/CT were to the skeleton in one patient, the lung in two patients, and the liver in one patient.  Conclusion:   This study suggests that Ga-PSMA PET/CT is useful for lymph node and metastases staging in high-risk prostate cancers, whereas its utility for staging of disease in the prostate is limited.""","""['Shruti Tulsyan', 'Chandan J Das', 'Madhavi Tripathi', 'Amlesh Seth', 'Rajeev Kumar', 'Chandrasekhar Bal']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'Value of 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET for the Assessment of Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence: Comparison with Histopathology After Salvage Lymphadenectomy.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', '68Ga-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) for primary staging of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', 'Feasibility of biology-guided radiotherapy using PSMA-PET to boost to dominant intraprostatic tumour.', 'The Continuum of Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Interpreting PSMA PET Findings in Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Head-to-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and Multiparametric MRI for Pelvic Lymph Node Staging Prior to Radical Prostatectomy in Patients With Intermediate to High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Incremental Impact of 68\xa0GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Primary N and M Staging of Prostate Cancer Prior to Curative-Intent Surgery: a Prospective Clinical Trial in Comparison with mpMRI.', 'Discrepancy between Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and 68Ga Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography: A Simultaneous Acquired Positron Emission Tomography-Magnetic Resonance Imaging Case.']"""

The strongest inhibitory effect on prostatic cells was observed after the application of extracts of spices in concentration of 12.5 mg·mL-1. An LC/MS analysis identified that the most abundant phenolic and flavonoid compounds in black pepper are 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and naringenin chalcone, while the most abundant phenolic and flavonoid compounds in caraway seeds are neochlorogenic acid and apigenin. Using an MTT assay for the phenolic and flavonoid compounds from spices, we identified the IC50 value of ~1 mmol·L-1 PNT1A.

Crk II, a member of CRK family, has been reported to regulate cell migration and metastasis in breast cancer cells. However, its role in other cancer types has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the molecular function of Crk II in prostate cancer (PCa) cells (CWR-22rv1) in vitro and using a mouse tumor model. Results showed that Crk II knockdown by shRNA-mediated silencing (Crk II-shRNA) in the PCa cells significantly inhibited both cancer cell migration and invasion in cell culture study. Crk II-shRNA cancer cells also significantly decreased colony formation in vitro, but had no significant reduction of tumor volume after 4 weeks of cancer cell xenografting in vivo when compared to the scramble control. Interestingly, Crk II-shRNA cancer cells showed a greatly reduced level of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and decreased signaling of the IGF-1R/PI3K/Akt axis upon IGF-1 ligand stimulation. A close interaction between Crk II and IGF-1R was demonstrated upon co-immunoprecipitation of IGF-1R with Crk II protein. Further, treatment of cells with either proteosomal degradation or protein synthesis inhibitor showed higher proportion of ubiquitin-associated IGF-1R and faster degradation of IGF-1R in Crk II-shRNA cells in comparison with that in the control cancer cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Crk II plays an important role in the regulation of IGF-1R protein stability and affects downstream of IGF-1R signaling pathways. Therefore, targeting Crk-II can block IGF-1R growth signaling and suppress cancer cell invasion and progression.""","""['Pooja Dhupkar', 'Huang Zhao', 'Kalpana Mujoo', 'Zhiqiang An', 'Ningyan Zhang']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Rep""","""['Metformin inhibits the proliferation of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells via the downregulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor.', 'Lentivirus-mediated RNAi knockdown of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor inhibits the growth and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma via down-regulating midkine expression.', 'The effect of forced expression of mutated K-RAS gene on gastrointestinal cancer cell lines and the IGF-1R targeting therapy.', 'Emerging Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Cancer: A Promising Biomarker and Therapeutic Target.', 'Niche Modulation of IGF-1R Signaling: Its Role in Stem Cell Pluripotency, Cancer Reprogramming, and Therapeutic Applications.', 'Anatomic position determines oncogenic specificity in melanoma.', 'miR-130b suppresses the invasion and migration of prostate cancer via inhibiting DLL1 and regulating the PI3K/Akt pathways.', ""MicroRNA-215-5p Inhibits the Proliferation and Migration of Wilm's Tumor Cells by Targeting CRK."", 'Crk and CrkL as Therapeutic Targets for Cancer Treatment.', 'Quantitative assessment of glioblastoma phenotypes in\xa0vitro establishes cell migration as a robust readout of Crk and CrkL activity.']"""

Phenotypic aspects such as morphology, body length, locomotion, and reproductive behaviour were analyzed. It is important to emphasize that the strain presents a phenotype characteristic with respect to egg laying and hatching. Reported studies showed that Annona muricata extract and its active components evidence anti-cancer and anti-tumor effects, through experimentation in vivo and in vitro models. However, neurotoxicity has been reported as a side effect. The results showed that the mutant strain NB327 was exposed to EEAML (5 mg/ml) concentration, it showed a significant decrease in average locomotion, resulting in 13 undulations in 30 s. This contrasts with the control strain's 17.5 undulations in 30 s. Similarly, the number of progenies was reduced from 188 progenies (control strain) to 114 and 92 progenies at the dose of (1 mg/ml and 5 mg/m) EEAML. The results of this study suggest that EEAML has a possible neurotoxic effect in concentrations equal to or greater than 5 mg/ml.

This study evaluated the potential for fusion-derived CASQs to be a source of tumor neoepitopes, and determined their relationship to patterns of immune signatures in prostate cancer patients.Experimental Design: A computational strategy was used to identify CASQs and their corresponding predicted MHC class I epitopes using RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas of prostate tumors. In vitro peptide-specific T-cell expansion was performed to identify CASQ-reactive T cells. A multivariate analysis was used to relate patterns of in silico-predicted tumor-infiltrating immune cells with prostate tumors harboring these mutational events.Results: Eighty-seven percent of tumors contained gene fusions with a mean of 12 per tumor. In total, 41% of fusion-positive tumors were found to encode CASQs. Within these tumors, 87% gave rise to predicted MHC class I-binding epitopes. This observation was more prominent when patients were stratified into low- and intermediate/high-risk categories. One of the identified CASQ from the recurrent TMPRSS2:ERG type VI fusion contained several high-affinity HLA-restricted epitopes. These peptides bound HLA-A*02:01 in vitro and were recognized by CD8+ T cells. Finally, the presence of fusions and CASQs were associated with expression of immune cell infiltration.Conclusions: Mutanome analysis of gene fusion-derived CASQs can give rise to patient-specific predicted neoepitopes. Moreover, these fusions predicted patterns of immune cell infiltration within a subgroup of prostate cancer patients.

The goal of the study was to report on the use of aggressive care and hospice services for patients younger than age 65 years.  Methods:   Using the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, we analyzed patients who died between 2007 and 2014 with metastatic lung (n = 12 764), colorectal (n = 5207), breast (n = 5855), pancreatic (n = 3397), or prostate (n = 1508) cancer. Based on published quality measures, we assessed uses of chemotherapy, intensive care, emergency room visits, and hospice care at the end of life. We examined additional items including radiotherapy, invasive procedures, hospitalization, and in-hospital deaths. Multivariable modified Poisson regression models were used to adjust for age, sex, geographic region, rural/urban location, year of death, and regional education and income measures.  Results:   Across the five cancers, 10.1% to 14.1% of patients received chemotherapy within the last 14 days of life, 15.9% to 20.6% received intensive care in last 30 days, and 1.5% to 2.5% went to the emergency room two or more times in last 30 days. Hospice enrollment at least three days before death was 54.4% to 59.6%. However, 55.3% to 59.3% of patients had a hospital admission in the last 30 days, and one-third died (30.3%-35.4%) in the hospital.

We characterized DNA damage response (DDR) signaling (γH2AX, pKAP1, pATM) and survival response to ionizing radiation (IR) in human chordoma samples (42 resections, 23 patients) to test if blocking cell adhesion sensitizes U-CH1 tumor cells to IR. U-CH1 cells expressed brachyury, YAP, and laminin adhesion receptors (CD49c, CD49f, CD44), and approximately 15% to 20% of U-CH1 cells featured an α6 integrin-dependent (CD49f) cohesive cluster phenotype, which confers therapeutic resistance and aids metastasis. DDR to IR in U-CH1 cells was compared to normal prostate epithelial (PrEC) and tumor cells (DU145). Flow cytometry showed a dose- and time-dependent increase in γH2AX and pKAP1 expression in all cell lines. However, nearly 50% of U-CH1 cells exhibited nonresponsive phenotype to IR (measured by γH2AX and pKAP1) independent of cell cycle status. Immunofluorescence microscopy verified that only 15% of U-CH1 clustered cells were γH2AX or pKAP1 positive (versus 80% of nonclustered cells) 2 hours following 2-Gy IR. Conversely, both tumor cell lines were uniformly defective in pATM response. HYD1, a synthetic ECM ligand, inhibited DDR through an unresolved γH2AX response. β1 integrin-blocking antibody (AIIB2) decreased cell survival 50% itself and approximately doubled the IR-induced cell kill at all IR doses observed at 2 and 4 weeks posttreatment. These results suggest that a heterogeneity of DDR to IR exists within a chordoma population. Blocking integrin function alone and/or as an adjuvant to IR may eradicate chordomas containing the cohesive cluster phenotype.""","""['William L Harryman', 'Jaime M C Gard', 'Kelvin W Pond', 'Skyler J Simpson', 'Lucas H Heppner', 'Daniel Hernandez-Cortes', 'Andrew S Little', 'Jennifer M Eschbacher', 'Anne E Cress']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Establishment and characterization of a chordoma cell line from the tissue of a patient with dedifferentiated-type chordoma.', 'Molecular characterization of chordoma xenografts generated from a novel primary chordoma cell source and two chordoma cell lines.', 'Chordoma-derived cell line U-CH1-N recapitulates the biological properties of notochordal nucleus pulposus cells.', 'Safety and Local Control of Radiation Therapy for Chordoma of the Spine and Sacrum: A Systematic Review.', 'Chordoma.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors are currently approved to treat certain cancers, but progress on the development of drug-like histone actyltransferase inhibitors has lagged behind. The histone acetyltransferase paralogues p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) are key transcriptional co-activators that are essential for a multitude of cellular processes, and have also been implicated in human pathological conditions (including cancer). Current inhibitors of the p300 and CBP histone acetyltransferase domains, including natural products, bi-substrate analogues and the widely used small molecule C646, lack potency or selectivity. Here, we describe A-485, a potent, selective and drug-like catalytic inhibitor of p300 and CBP. We present a high resolution (1.95 Å) co-crystal structure of a small molecule bound to the catalytic active site of p300 and demonstrate that A-485 competes with acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). A-485 selectively inhibited proliferation in lineage-specific tumour types, including several haematological malignancies and androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer. A-485 inhibited the androgen receptor transcriptional program in both androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer and inhibited tumour growth in a castration-resistant xenograft model. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using small molecule inhibitors to selectively target the catalytic activity of histone acetyltransferases, which may provide effective treatments for transcriptional activator-driven malignancies and diseases.""","""['Loren M Lasko', 'Clarissa G Jakob', 'Rohinton P Edalji', 'Wei Qiu', 'Debra Montgomery', 'Enrico L Digiammarino', 'T Matt Hansen', 'Roberto M Risi', 'Robin Frey', 'Vlasios Manaves', 'Bailin Shaw', 'Mikkel Algire', 'Paul Hessler', 'Lloyd T Lam', 'Tamar Uziel', 'Emily Faivre', 'Debra Ferguson', 'Fritz G Buchanan', 'Ruth L Martin', 'Maricel Torrent', 'Gary G Chiang', 'Kannan Karukurichi', 'J William Langston', 'Brian T Weinert', 'Chunaram Choudhary', 'Peter de Vries', 'John H Van Drie', 'David McElligott', 'Ed Kesicki', 'Ronen Marmorstein', 'Chaohong Sun', 'Philip A Cole', 'Saul H Rosenberg', 'Michael R Michaelides', 'Albert Lai', 'Kenneth D Bromberg']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Author Correction: Discovery of a selective catalytic p300/CBP inhibitor that targets lineage-specific tumours.', 'Combination Targeting of the Bromodomain and Acetyltransferase Active Site of p300/CBP.', 'Virtual ligand screening of the p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase: identification of a selective small molecule inhibitor.', 'Current development of CBP/p300 inhibitors in the last decade.', 'The structural basis of protein acetylation by the p300/CBP transcriptional coactivator.', 'Structure and chemistry of the p300/CBP and Rtt109 histone acetyltransferases: implications for histone acetyltransferase evolution and function.', 'Histone acetyltransferase P300 deficiency promotes ferroptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells by activating the HIF-1α/HMOX1 axis.', 'The KDM6A-KMT2D-p300 axis regulates susceptibility to diverse coronaviruses by mediating viral receptor expression.', 'EP300 facilitates human trophoblast stem cell differentiation.', 'Acetylation Targeting Chimera Enables Acetylation of the Tumor Suppressor p53.', 'NUP98 and RAE1 sustain progenitor function through HDAC-dependent chromatin targeting to escape from nucleolar localization.']"""

Materials and methods:   Transperineal IPA and penile Doppler ultrasonography was performed in 50 healthy young male volunteers aged 23.6+/-3.4 years without ED (IIEF-5 score of 21-22) and 60 patients with ED (IIEF-5 score of 6-18, mean age 49+/-4.6 years), including 30 men with prostate cancer (PCa) after comprehensive treatment and 30 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. To determine the diagnostic value of the transperineal IPA imaging, the results were compared with the findings of magnetic resonance or contrast-enhanced dynamic CT angiography of the iliac arteries.  Results:   In all healthy men no abnormalities were found in the perineal primary arterial blood flow, in 100% of cases perineal branch of IPA was rectilinear, while patients with arteriogenic ED had low IPA and penile peak systolic blood flow velocity (<0.05), pathologically altered type of blood flow and non-rectilinear course of IPA, stenosis and occlusion in the pelvic and extrapelvic branches of IPA. When comparing the findings of IPA Doppler ultrasound and angiography studies of the small pelvis in healthy men, they completely matched, showing satisfactory arterial IPA perfusion, absence of stenoses or occlusions. Sensitivity and specificity of the transperineal IPA ultrasound imaging were 95% and 90%, respectively.  Conclusion:   Transperineal IPA ultrasound imaging allows to assess the important morphometric features of the perineal branches of IPA - the arterial diameter, the response to stimulation, the course of the artery, the type of arterial blood flow, the presence or absence of arterial stenoses and occlusions, and to measure peak systolic blood flow velocity.""","""['E Povelitsa', 'N I Dosta', 'O V Parhomenko', 'D M Nitkin', 'A M Shesternja', 'V V Anichkin']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['Duplex ultrasonography and internal pudendal arteriogram in the diagnosis of trauma-associated arteriogenic erectile dysfunction (a report of 7 cases).', 'Internal pudendal artery stenoses and erectile dysfunction: correlation with angiographic coronary artery disease.', 'Comparison of digital subtraction angiography, CT angiography, and ultrasonic Doppler examination in the evaluation of penile arterial lesions.', 'Doppler evaluation of erectile dysfunction - part 2.', 'The role of penile color-duplex ultrasound for the evaluation of erectile dysfunction.']"""

Indications for their clinical use for various pathological conditions are constantly expanding.  Aim:   To compare the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone and ADT with concomitant use of tamsulosin in treating lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and to estimate the efficacy and safety of tamsulosin in relieving voiding dysfunction symptoms in patients with advanced PCa treated for 6 months.  Materials and methods:   This paper presents data from a randomized, open, single-center trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of tamsulosin co-administered with ADT for LUTS in patients with advanced prostate cancer. The study comprised 50 people aged below 75 years. In the first group of patients (n=25), ADT was used as a monotherapy, in the second group (n=25) ADT with concurrent administration of the -adrenoblocker. The duration of treatment was 6 months.  Results:   Both groups showed an improvement in the severity of LUTS, decrease in the total I-PSS score and residual urine volume and increase in the urinary flow rate. At the same time, co-administration of ADT and -adrenoblocker resulted in greater and faster relief of LUTS than using ADT alone. There were no significant side effects in any of the groups.

Methods:   PC-3 and DU-145 PCa cell lines were transfected by artificially synthesized miR-663 and its antisense plasmid, and cell proliferation was assessed using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to assess the expression of miR-663 in tissue samples collected from 46 patients who were diagnosed with PCa but did not receive any treatment. Another 20 healthy subjects served as controls. According to morphologic and clinical data of tumor tissues in hematoxylin & eosin stained sections, we investigated the correlations of miR-663 with the pathological grade and clinical stage of PCa.  Methods:   miR-663 transfection significantly increased the proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells, while transfection of the miR-663 antisense plasmid inhibited the proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells. This suggested that miR-663 can promote the metastasis of PCa. Through detection of the tissue expression of miR-663, the highest and lowest expression of miR-663 were found in the PCa group and healthy group, respectively. Therefore, increased expression of miR-663 in PCa patients was associated with the grade of malignancy . The expression of miR-663 was positively correlated with pathological stage (p<0.05; r=0.7404), and with the clinical stage (p<0.05;r=0.8610), suggesting that miR-663 is closely correlated with the pathological grade and clinical stage of PCa.  Results:   PDGFRα and PDGFRβ were frequently expressed on malignant PCs. We found that increased PDGFRβ expression was strongly associated with advanced disease and adverse prognosis. The expression of PDGFRα and MDV were not correlated with specific features.  Conclusion:   miR-663 can significantly increase the proliferation of PCa cells, and its expression is closely correlated with the pathological grade and clinical stage of PCa.

Methods and materials:   Prostate dosimetry studies using inverse planning techniques were identified through a search of PubMed and EMBASE databases. These studies were analyzed to determine if the endpoints reported followed the recommendations outlined in ICRU-83. A data collection form was completed and any alternative methods of reporting were recorded. Results were analyzed using frequencies, percentages, and Fisher exact tests.  Results:   The ICRU-83 recommendations were not followed in the majority of studies. For the planning target volume, the dose received by 2% of the volume, the dose received by 98% of the volume, and the dose received by 50% of the volume were reported in 22.9%, 18.8%, and 8.3% of studies, respectively. The adherence to reporting for the clinical target volume was below 5% for all specifications. The mean dose, the dose received by a specified volume, and dose received by 2% of the volume for organs at risk were reported in 47.1%, 83.3%, and 16.7%, respectively. The homogeneity index was used in 14.6% of studies. Conformity was discussed in 45.8% of studies. Confidence intervals were included in 37.5% of studies.  Conclusions:   The reporting recommendations of ICRU-83 were not adhered to in the majority of the dosimetry studies reviewed, highlighting the need for greater diligence for authors and reviewers when publishing planning outcomes for modulated techniques.""","""['Aishling Mohan', 'Elizabeth Forde']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['State of dose prescription and compliance to international standard (ICRU-83) in intensity modulated radiation therapy among academic institutions.', 'Dosimetric advantages and superior treatment delivery efficiency of RapidArc over conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer involving seminal vesicles and pelvic nodes.', 'Anatomy-based inverse planning simulated annealing optimization in high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy: significant dosimetric advantage over other optimization techniques.', 'State of the art on dose prescription, reporting and recording in Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (ICRU report No. 83).', 'A focused review of statistical practices for relating radiation dose-volume exposure and toxicity.', 'Dose prescription and reporting in stereotactic body radiotherapy: A multi-institutional study.', 'Loosening Neuro-Optic Structures Dosimetric Constraints Provides High 5-Year Local\xa0Recurrence-Free\xa0Survival With Acceptable Toxicity in T4 Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients Treated With Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy.', 'Using biologically based objectives to optimize boost intensity-modulated radiation therapy planning for brainstem tumors in dogs.']"""

Methods:   Patients completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life (QOL) Bone Metastases module (QLQ-BM22), EORTC QOL Core-15-Palliative (QLQ-C15-PAL), and Dexamethasone Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) before a single 8-Gy radiation treatment, on days 10 and 42 after treatment. Patient demographics, performance status, analgesic consumption, BM22, C15, and DSQ were compared with multivariant analysis between patients under 75 years and 75 years and older. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the differences between age-groups, adjusting for baseline demographics and primary disease sites.  Results:   There were 298 patients (170 male) with 209 (70%) less than 75 years of age. Most common primary cancer sites include lung, prostate, and breast. At baseline, younger patients had better performance status, consumed more analgesic, and reported worse scores in nausea, insomnia, and functional interference, while older patients more commonly had prostate cancer. There were no significant differences in the incidence of radiation-induced pain flare; response to radiation; changes from baseline for BM22, C15-PAL; and DSQ, nor overall survival at day 42 between the 2 groups. Responders to radiation in the elderly group reported better improvement in physical and emotional domains when compared with nonresponders.  Conclusions:   In patients with cancer having bone metastases undergoing palliative radiotherapy, there was no significant difference in general with age in response to radiation and patient-reported outcomes.

However, the effect of carvacrol on intracellular Ca²⁺ and its related physiology in human prostate cancer is unknown. This study explored the effect of carvacrol on cytosolic free Ca²⁺ levels ([Ca²⁺]i) and viability in PC3 human prostate cancer cells. Fura-2, a Ca²⁺- sensitive fluorescent dye, was used to assess [Ca²⁺]i. Cell viability was measured by the detecting reagent WST-1. Carvacrol at concentrations of 200-800 μM caused [Ca²⁺]i rises in a concentration-dependent manner. Removal of extracellular Ca²⁺ reduced carvacrol’s effect by approximately 60%. Carvacrol-induced Ca²⁺ entry was confirmed by Mn²⁺ entry-induced quench of fura-2 fluorescence, and was inhibited by approximately 30% by nifedipine, econazole, SKF96365, and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF109203X. In Ca²⁺-free medium, treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ pump inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) abolished carvacrol-induced [Ca²⁺]i rises. Treatment with carvacrol also abolished TG-induced [Ca²⁺]i rises. Carvacrol-induced Ca²⁺ release from the endoplasmic reticulum was abolished by inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC). Carvacrol killed cells at concentrations of 200-600 μM in a concentration-dependent fashion. Chelating cytosolic Ca²⁺ with BAPTA/AM did not prevent carvacrol’s cytotoxicity. Together, in PC3 cells, carvacrol induced [Ca²⁺]i rises by inducing PLC-dependent Ca²⁺ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca²⁺ entry via PKC-sensitive store-operated Ca²⁺ channels and other unknown channels. Carvacrol also induced Ca²⁺-dissociated cell death.""","""['Chi-Ting Horng#', 'Chiang-Ting Chou', 'Te-Kung Sun#', 'Wei-Zhe Liang#', 'Chun-Chi Kuo', 'Jue-Long Wang', 'Pochuen Shieh', 'Chung-Ren Jan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Chin J Physiol""","""['Effect of 2,5-dimethylphenol on Ca(2+) movement and viability in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Carvacrol-induced Ca2+i rise and apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells.', 'Effect of thymol on Ca²⁺ homeostasis and viability in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms underlying the effect of an oral antihyperglycaemic agent glyburide on calcium ion (Ca2+ ) movement and its related cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells.', 'The investigation of minoxidil-induced Ca2+i rises and non-Ca2+-triggered cell death in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Screening and Validation of a Carvacrol-Targeting Viability-Regulating Protein, SLC6A3, in Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Antitumor Effects of Carvacrol and Thymol: A Systematic Review.']"""

In vivo studies have concentrated on the effects of flavonoids on cancer and genistein (GE), a soy-derived isoflavone, has been reported to reduce prostate, colon, hepatic and breast adenocarcinoma risk. Tamoxifen (TAM) is an important drug for cancer treatment worldwide, which can induce apoptosis in various cancers, including examples in the liver, breast and ovaries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of GE and TAM, alone and in combination, on proliferation and apoptosis in the human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cell line. Materials and Methods: HepG 2 cells were treated with GE, TAM and GE/TAM and then MTT and flow cytometry assays were conducted to determine effects on viability and apoptosis, respectively. Results: GE and TAM inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in the HepG 2 cell lines. Discussion: Our findings clearly indicated that GE and TAM may exert inhibitory and apoptotic effects in liver cancer cells.

A rational design and suitable preparation method must be employed to be able to exploit attractive properties of magnetic nanocomposite particles.  Objectives:   Herein, we report on a simple approach for the synthesis of magnetic mesoporous silica nanocomposite particles (MMSPs), consisted of a Fe3O4 cluster core, a nonporous silica shell and a second shell of the mesoporous silica of suitable sizes for biomedical applications and evaluate their cytotoxicity effects on human cancer prostate cell lines.  Materials and methods:   Clusters of magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were coated by a layer of nonporous silica using Stöber method. The coating step was completed by an outer layer of mesoporous silica via template-removing method. Structural properties of MMSPs were investigated by FTIR, HR-S(T)EM, BET, XRD techniques and magnetic properties of MMSPs by VSM instrument. MTT and LDH assays were employed to study the cytotoxicity of MMSPs.  Results:   Obtained results revealed that decreasing the precursor concentration and the reaction time at the nonporous silica shell formation step decreases the thickness of the nonporous silica shell and consequently leads to the formation of smaller MMSPs. The as-prepared MMSPs have a desirable average size of 180±10 nm, an average pore size of 3.01 nm, a high surface area of 390.4 m2.g-1 and a large pore volume of 0.294 cm3.g-1. In addition, the MMSPs exhibited a superparamagnetic behavior and a high magnetization saturation value of 21±0.5 emu/g. Furthermore, the viability tests of DU-145 cell lines exposed to various concentrations of these particles demonstrated negligible cytotoxicity effects of the as-prepared particles.  Conclusions:   These results demonstrate interesting properties of MMSPs prepared in this study for biomedical applications.""","""['Forough Toubi', 'Abdolkhalegh Deezagi', 'Gurvinder Singh', 'Mohammad Ali Oghabian', 'Seyed Safa Ali Fatemi', 'Ayyoob Arpanaei']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""Iran J Biotechnol""","""['Magnetite Nanoparticles-Supported APTES as a Powerful and Recoverable Nanocatalyst for the Preparation of 2-Amino-5,10-dihydro- 5,10-dioxo-4H-benzogchromenes and Tetrahydrobenzogquinoline-5,10- diones.', 'Ultrasonic-assisted ultra-rapid synthesis of monodisperse meso-SiO2@Fe3O4 microspheres with enhanced mesoporous structure.', 'Preparation of amino-functionalized Fe3O4@mSiO2 core-shell magnetic nanoparticles and their application for aqueous Fe3+ removal.', 'Advances in the Interfacial Assembly of Mesoporous Silica on Magnetite Particles.', 'Multifunctional mesoporous silica nanocomposite nanoparticles for theranostic applications.', 'Comparative heating efficiency and cytotoxicity of magnetic silica nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermia treatment on human breast cancer cells.', 'Recent Trends in Morphology-Controlled Synthesis and Application of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles.']"""
