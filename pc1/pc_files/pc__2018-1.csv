Methods and materials:   Ten patients (5Head&Neck, 5Prostate) were included. A research DIR tool (ADMRIE_v1.12) was utilized for IM-DIR. After IM-DIR, BM-DIR was carried out for organs (parotids, bladder, and rectum) which often encompass sharp dose gradient. Briefly, high-quality tetrahedron meshes were generated and deformable vector fields (DVF) from IM-DIR were interpolated to the surface nodes of the volume meshes as boundary condition. Then, a FEM solver (ABAQUS_v6.14) was used to simulate the displacement of internal nodes, which were then interpolated to image-voxel grids to get the more physically plausible DVF. Both geometrical and subsequent dose warping discrepancies were quantified between the two DIR methods. Target registration discrepancy(TRD) was evaluated to show the geometry difference. The re-calculated doses on second CT were warped to the pre-treatment CT via two DIR. Clinical-relevant dose parameters and γ passing rate were compared between two types of warped dose. The correlation was evaluated between parotid shrinkage and TRD/dose discrepancy.  Result:   The parotid shrunk to 75.7% ± 9% of its pre-treatment volume and the percentage of volume with TRD>1.5 mm) was 6.5% ± 4.7%. The normalized mean-dose difference (NMDD) of IM-DIR and BM-DIR was -0.8% ± 1.5%, with range (-4.7% to 1.5%). 2 mm/2% passing rate was 99.0% ± 1.4%. A moderate correlation was found between parotid shrinkage and TRD and NMDD. The bladder had a NMDD of -9.9% ± 9.7%, with BM-DIR warped dose systematically higher. Only minor deviation was observed for rectum NMDD (0.5% ± 1.1%).  Conclusion:   Impact of DIR method on treatment dose warping is patient and organ-specific. Generally, intensity-homogeneous organs, which undergo larger deformation/shrinkage during treatment and encompass sharp dose gradient, will have greater dose warping uncertainty. For these organs, BM-DIR could be beneficial to the evaluation of DIR/dose-warping uncertainty.""","""['An Qin', 'Jian Liang', 'Xiao Han', ""Nicolette O'Connell"", 'Di Yan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['The evaluation of a hybrid biomechanical deformable registration method on a multistage physical phantom with reproducible deformation.', 'Toward adaptive radiotherapy for head and neck patients: Uncertainties in dose warping due to the choice of deformable registration algorithm.', 'Validation of a deformable image registration technique for cone beam CT-based dose verification.', '""Patient-specific validation of deformable image registration in radiation therapy: Overview and caveats"".', 'Deformable image registration for radiation therapy: principle, methods, applications and evaluation.', 'Dosimetric impact of deformable image registration using radiophotoluminescent glass dosimeters with a physical geometric phantom.', 'Dynamic Characteristics and Predictive Capability of Tumor Voxel Dose-Response Assessed Using 18F-FDG PET/CT Imaging Feedback.', 'Trajectory log analysis and cone-beam CT-based daily dose calculation to investigate the dosimetric accuracy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy for gynecologic cancer.', 'Differences between planned and delivered dose for head and neck cancer, and their consequences for normal tissue complication probability and treatment adaptation.', 'Head and Neck Cancer Adaptive Radiation Therapy (ART): Conceptual Considerations for the Informed Clinician.']"""

Methods:   A mixed methods study design was used. Eligibility criteria included Irish physiotherapists treating patients with advanced cancer. An online survey instrument was created, which included: (1) A quantitative section that explored physiotherapists' views on the role of physical activity for patients with advanced cancer; and (2) A qualitative section that explored physiotherapists' prescription of physical activity for two patient case studies. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.  Results:   A total of 38 physiotherapists completed the study. In all, 94% (n = 36) of physiotherapists agreed with the statement ""being physically active is important for patients with advanced cancer"" and 80% (n = 30) stated a need for further information on prescribing physical activity to patients with advanced cancer. A content analysis of case study responses demonstrated physiotherapists have a number of concerns regarding the prescription of physical activity to patients with bone metastasis. Concerns center on patients' increased fracture risk, the presence of osteoporosis and the risk of falls in this patient group.  Conclusion:   The majority of physiotherapists perceived physical activity to be of benefit for patients living with advanced cancer. There is a need for more education and training around the prescription of physical activity programs to advanced cancer populations. Physiotherapists' responses suggest patients with advanced cancer have limited exposure to factors that may prompt increased physical activity levels post diagnosis.""","""['Gráinne Sheill', 'Emer Guinan', 'Linda O Neill', 'David Hevey', 'Juliette Hussey']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Physiother Theory Pract""","""['Exercise in cancer care in Ireland: a survey of oncology nurses and physiotherapists.', ""Physiotherapists' views about providing physiotherapy services to people with severe and persistent mental illness: a mixed methods study."", ""Bridging the gap between research-based knowledge and clinical practice: a qualitative examination of patients and physiotherapists' views on the Otago exercise Programme."", 'Physiotherapists may stigmatise or feel unprepared to treat people with low back pain and psychosocial factors that influence recovery: a systematic review.', 'Emancipatory physiotherapy practice.', 'PERSPECTIVEs on supervised exercise programs in people with metastatic breast cancer- a qualitative study in four European countries.', 'A Cancer Exercise Toolkit Developed Using Co-Design: Mixed Methods Study.', 'Knowledge and views of physicians and nurses about physical activity advice in oncology care: a cross-sectional study.', 'Exercise Recommendation for People With Bone Metastases: Expert Consensus for Health Care Providers and Exercise Professionals.', 'Physical activity for people living with cancer: Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of general practitioners in Australia.']"""

In this study, we investigated the effect of the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin on the cytotoxicity of TRAIL variants in 12 tumor cell lines of various origin. Cisplatin effectively enhances the cytotoxic activity of TRAIL preparations. The synergistic effect is most pronounced in the prostate cancer cell lines, where the combined effect exceeds the sum of the separate effects by more than 2 times.

The aim of this study was to determine the molecular aberrations associated with CR/IDC in primary prostate cancer, focusing on genomic instability and somatic copy number alterations (CNA).  Methods:   Whole-slide images of The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA, N = 260) and the Canadian Prostate Cancer Genome Network (CPC-GENE, N = 199) radical prostatectomy datasets were reviewed for Gleason score (GS) and presence of CR/IDC. Genomic instability was assessed by calculating the percentage of genome altered (PGA). Somatic copy number alterations (CNA) were determined using Fisher-Boschloo tests and logistic regression. Primary analysis were performed on TCGA (N = 260) as discovery and CPC-GENE (N = 199) as validation set.  Results:   CR/IDC growth was present in 80/260 (31%) TCGA and 76/199 (38%) CPC-GENE cases. Patients with CR/IDC and ≥ GS 7 had significantly higher PGA than men without this pattern in both TCGA (2.2 fold; p = 0.0003) and CPC-GENE (1.7 fold; p = 0.004) cohorts. CR/IDC growth was associated with deletions of 8p, 16q, 10q23, 13q22, 17p13, 21q22, and amplification of 8q24. CNAs comprised a total of 1299 gene deletions and 369 amplifications in the TCGA dataset, of which 474 and 328 events were independently validated, respectively. Several of the affected genes were known to be associated with aggressive prostate cancer such as loss of PTEN, CDH1, BCAR1 and gain of MYC. Point mutations in TP53, SPOP and FOXA1were also associated with CR/IDC, but occurred less frequently than CNAs.  Conclusions:   CR/IDC growth is associated with increased genomic instability clustering to genetic regions involved in aggressive prostate cancer. Therefore, CR/IDC is a pathologic substrate for progressive molecular tumour derangement.""","""['René Böttcher', 'Charlotte F Kweldam', 'Julie Livingstone', 'Emilie Lalonde', 'Takafumi N Yamaguchi', 'Vincent Huang', 'Fouad Yousif', 'Michael Fraser', 'Robert G Bristow', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Paul C Boutros', 'Guido Jenster', 'Geert J L H van Leenders']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['A Prostate Cancer ""Nimbosus"": Genomic Instability and SChLAP1 Dysregulation Underpin Aggression of Intraductal and Cribriform Subpathologies.', 'Chromosomal imbalances, loss of heterozygosity, and immunohistochemical expression of TP53, RB1, and PTEN in intraductal cancer, intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'PTEN loss in prostatic adenocarcinoma correlates with specific adverse histologic features (intraductal carcinoma, cribriform Gleason pattern 4 and stromogenic carcinoma).', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Genomic Features and Clinical Implications of Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Construction of an RNA modification-related gene predictive model associated with prognosis and immunity in gastric cancer.', 'A DNA copy number alteration classifier as a prognostic tool for prostate cancer patients.', 'Cribriform pattern in prostate tissues: Predictor for intraductal carcinoma of the prostate based on biopsy and radical prostatectomy pathology.', 'Prostate Cancer Morphologies: Cribriform Pattern and Intraductal Carcinoma Relations to Adverse Pathological and Clinical Outcomes-Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'DNA repair deficiency as circulating biomarker in prostate cancer.']"""

Aims:   In the current study, we aimed to investigate the tumor suppressive roles of SOCS6 and the underlying mechanisms in PCa.  Methods:   SOCS6 expression in PCa and non-cancerous prostate tissues was compared by immunohistochemistry. Statistical associations of SOCS6 expression with various clinicopathological features and patients prognosis were evaluated. In addition, we investigated SOCS6's functions by overexpressing it in vitro (cell apoptosis, migration and invasion assays) and in vivo (tumor formation, angiogenesis and apoptosis). Moreover, SOCS6-regulated genes were identified by nextgeneration RNA-sequencing analysis, followed by pathway enrichment analysis and in vitro experimental validation.  Results:   SOCS6 downregulation was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage (P=0.029) and positive lymph node metastasis (P=0.013) in PCa patients. We also identified SOCS6 as an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival in PCa patients (P=0.045). Moreover, overexpression of SOCS6 inhibited PCa cell invasion, migration, tumor xenografts growth and angiogenesis, but induced PCa cell apoptosis (P values <0.05). Mechanically, we revealed that SOCS6 expression may induce cell apoptosis coincident with down-regulation of Bcl2 and Hspa1a, and may suppress tumor angiogenesis with downregulation of F7, Fak3 and Frzb.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that the reduced expression of SOCS6 may be predictive of unfavorable prognosis in PCa.

Although differential expression of miRNAs have been implicated in many diseases (including cancers), the underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear. Because each miRNA can target multiple genes, miRNAs may potentially have functional implications for the overall behavior of entire pathways. Here, we investigate the functional consequences of miRNA dysregulation through an integrative analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression data using a novel approach that incorporates pathway information a priori. By searching for miRNA-pathway associations that differ between healthy and tumor tissue, we identify specific relationships at the systems level which are disrupted in cancer. Our approach is motivated by the hypothesis that if an miRNA and pathway are associated, then the expression of the miRNA and the collective behavior of the genes in a pathway will be correlated. As such, we first obtain an expression-based summary of pathway activity using Isomap, a dimension reduction method which can articulate non-linear structure in high-dimensional data. We then search for miRNAs that exhibit differential correlations with the pathway summary between phenotypes as a means of finding aberrant miRNA-pathway coregulation in tumors. We apply our method to cancer data using gene and miRNA expression datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and compare ∼105 miRNA-pathway relationships between healthy and tumor samples from four tissues (breast, prostate, lung and liver).

We integrated transcriptomic data for two clonal subpopulations from a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) into a genome-scale metabolic network model to explore their metabolic differences and potential vulnerabilities. In this dual cell model, PC-3/S cells express Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition markers and display high invasiveness and low metastatic potential, while PC-3/M cells present the opposite phenotype and higher proliferative rate. Model-driven analysis and experimental validations unveiled a marked metabolic reprogramming in long-chain fatty acids metabolism. While PC-3/M cells showed an enhanced entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, PC-3/S cells used long-chain fatty acids as precursors of eicosanoid metabolism.

The methodology for the extrapolation of the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and absorbed doses from a given to an alternative radiopharmaceutical is presented.  Methods:   Sequential single photon emission CT images from 22 patients treated with 5 GBq of 186Re-HEDP were used to extrapolate the time-activity curves for various radiopharmaceuticals. Cumulated activity distributions for the delivered and extrapolated treatment plans were converted into absorbed dose distributions using the convolution dosimetry method. The lesion absorbed doses obtained for the different treatments were compared using the patient population distributions and cumulative dose-volume histograms.  Results:   The median lesion absorbed doses across the patient cohort ranged from 2.7 Gy (range: 0.6-11.8 Gy) for 1100 MBq of 166Ho-DOTMP to 21.8 Gy (range: 4.5-117.6 Gy) for 150 MBq of 89Sr-dichloride. 32P-Na3PO4, 153Sm-EDTMP, 166Ho-DOTMP, 177Lu-EDTMP and 188Re-HEDP would have delivered 41, 32, 85, 20 and 64% lower absorbed doses, for the typical administered activities as compared to 186Re-HEDP, respectively, whilst 89Sr-dichloride would have delivered 25% higher absorbed doses.  Conclusion:   For the patient cohort studied, a wide range of absorbed doses would have been delivered for typical administration protocols in mCRPC. The methodology presented has potential use for emerging theragnostic agents. Advances in knowledge: The same patient cohort can receive a range of lesion absorbed doses from typical molecular radiotherapy treatments for patients with metastatic prostate cancer, highlighting the need to establish absorbed dose response relationships and to treat patients according to absorbed dose instead of using fixed administered activities.""","""['Ana M Denis-Bacelar', 'Sarah J Chittenden', 'V Ralph McCready', 'Antigoni Divoli', 'David P Dearnaley', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Bernadette Johnson', 'Glenn D Flux']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Phase I/II trials of 186Re-HEDP in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: post-hoc analysis of the impact of administered activity and dosimetry on survival.', 'Characterization of the (153)SmSm-EDTMP pharmacokinetics and estimation of radiation absorbed dose on an individual basis.', 'Dosimetry of 188Re-hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate in human prostate cancer skeletal metastases.', 'Treatment of metastatic bone pain using the bone seeking radiopharmaceutical Re-186-HEDP.', 'Radiopharmaceuticals for Palliation of Bone Pain in Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Metastatic to Bone: A Systematic Review.', 'Differential responses to 223Ra and Alpha-particles exposure in prostate cancer driven by mitotic catastrophe.', 'The various therapeutic applications of the medical isotope holmium-166: a narrative review.']"""

Methods:   Germline genetic variants in 89 genes in the histone methylation and acetylation pathway were explored. Gene-based and pathway-based associations with eight types of cancers were analyzed using logistic regression models and the permutation-based adaptive rank-truncated product method, respectively.  Results:   Gene-level associations revealed that genetic variants in 45 genes were significantly associated with the risk of cancer. The total histone methylation and acetylation pathway was significantly associated with the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (P = 0.0492) and prostate (P = 0.0038), lung (P = 0.00015), and bladder cancer (P = 0.00135), but not with breast (P = 0.182), pancreatic (P = 0.336) and gastric cancer (P = 0.347) and renal cell carcinoma (P =0.828).

MCRNLMP is a tumor composed entirely of numerous cysts, the septa of which contain individual or groups of clear cells without expansile growth. However, unlike MCRCC, neither recurrence nor metastasis has been reported in MCRNLMP. The aim of this study was to identify significant differential pathological characteristics in resected specimens from patients diagnosed with MCRNLMP (n=13) and MCRCC (n=17) using immunohistochemistry of 25 tissue markers. Staining interpretation was performed semi-quantitatively using the H-score (0-300) or intensity score (0-3), and differences between groups were evaluated using the Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. During a median follow-up of 66.2 months (1-141.9 months), there was only one case of MCRCC recurrence among all 30 patients, including 19 (63.3%) at stage pT1a, 8 (26.7%) at stage pT1b, and 3 (10.0%) patients at stage pT2.

Prepared nanocarriers were stabilized and functionalized via zinc ions incorporated into the chitosan nanoparticle backbone. We took the advantage of high expression of sarcosine in the prostate cancer cells. The prostate cancer targeting was mediated by the AntiSar antibodies decorated surface of the nanocage. Formation of the chitosan nanoparticles was determined using a ninhydrin assay and differential pulse voltammetry. Obtained results showed the strong effect of tripolyphosphine on the nanoparticle formation. The zinc ions affected strong chitosan backbone coiling both in inner and outer chitosan nanoparticle structure. Zinc electrochemical signal depended on the level of the complex formation and the potential shift from -960 to -950 mV. Formed complex is suitable for doxorubicin delivery. It was observed the 20% entrapment efficiency of doxorubicin and strong dependence of drug release after 120 min in the blood environment. The functionality of the designed nanotransporter was proven. The purposed determination showed linear dependence in the concentration range of Anti-sarcosine IgG labeled gold nanoparticles from 0 to 1000 µg/mL and the regression equation was found to be y = 3.8x - 66.7 and R² = 0.99. Performed ELISA confirmed the ability of Anti-sarcosine IgG labeled chitosan nanoparticles with loaded doxorubicin to bind to the sarcosine molecule. Observed hemolytic activity of the nanotransporter was 40%. Inhibition activity of our proposed nanotransporter was evaluated to be 0% on the experimental model of S. cerevisiae.

Background:   More focus is needed on the experience of people living with cancer, as current cancer care more emphasises on independence and resilience without fully acknowledging that there will be moments in the cancer journey where patients will need ""basic nursing care"" to manage their symptoms and care pathways.  Design:   Secondary analysis of qualitative data.  Method:   Secondary thematic analysis of interview data from 30 people with a diagnosis of breast (n = 10), colorectal (n = 10) or prostate (n = 10) cancer was undertaken.  Results:   The findings revealed vivid descriptions of the fundamentals of care (i.e., basic needs) and participants described physical, psychosocial and relational aspects of the delivery of care. Both positive (e.g., supportive and kind) and negative (e.g., humiliating) experiences related to the relationship with the healthcare professionals were re-counted and affected the participants' experiences of the fundamentals of care. Participants' accounts of their fundamental care needs were provided without them identifying who, within the healthcare system, was responsible for providing these needs. Specific nursing interventions were seldom described.  Conclusion:   Some people with a cancer diagnosis have to strive for help and support from the nursing staff to manage to regain control over their recovery. Nurses in cancer care need to focus on the patients' fundamental care needs to optimise their patients' recovery.  Relevance to clinical practice:   Cancer patients require support with their fundamental care needs and nurses need to be more aware of this and integrate it into the caring relationship. It is imperative that the complexity of the nurse-patient relationship is acknowledged and that models of care which honour this complexity are used.""","""['Åsa Muntlin Athlin', 'Maria Brovall', 'Yvonne Wengström', 'Tiffany Conroy', 'Alison L Kitson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Nurs""","""['Exploring person-centred fundamental nursing care in hospital wards: A multi-site ethnography.', ""Stroke survivors' experiences of the fundamentals of care: a qualitative analysis."", 'The liminality of the patient with dementia in hospital.', 'Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment and Caring for the Older Person with Cancer.', 'Nursing young people with cancer: What is ""different"" about it?', 'Body care of older people in different institutionalized settings: A systematic mapping review of international nursing research from a Scandinavian perspective.', 'Competencies for Nurses Regarding Psychosocial Care of Patients With Cancer in Africa: An Imperative for Action.', 'Speaking Up for Fundamental Care: the ILC Aalborg Statement.']"""

However, the inherent difficulty in collecting dilute concentrations of EVs (<0.01 volume %) from urine has hindered the development of these diagnoses and medical checkups. We propose a device composed of nanowires anchored into a microfluidic substrate. This device enables EV collections at high efficiency and in situ extractions of various miRNAs of different sequences (around 1000 types) that significantly exceed the number of species being extracted by the conventional ultracentrifugation method.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which IGF-I promotes prostate cancer development remain to be elucidated. Docetaxel chemotherapy is an important therapeutic strategy in many types of human cancers including prostate cancer. In this study, we showed that IGF-I rendered PC-3 and DU145 cells more resistant to docetaxel treatment. IGF-I treatment decreased miR-143 expression, but increased the expression levels of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), direct targets of miR-143. Overexpression of miR-143 abolished IGF-I-induced chemoresistance to docetaxel treatment, decreased expression levels of IGF-I, IRS1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, docetaxel treatment significantly inhibited VEGF transcriptional activation, whereas IGF-I treatment induced VEGF transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner. Forced expression of IGF-IR and IRS1 cDNAs without the 3' UTR regions restored miR-143-inhibited VEGF transcriptional activation. Finally, miR-143 inhibited tumor growth and made cells more sensitive to docetaxel treatment for decreasing tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our data demonstrates that IGF-I induces docetaxel resistance and upregulates IGF-IR and IRS1 expression through miR-143 downregulation, whereas miR-143 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting its targets IGF-IR and IRS1.""","""['Xiao-Bing Niu', 'Guang-Bo Fu', 'Lin Wang', 'Xin Ge', 'Wei-Tao Liu', 'Yi-Yang Wen', 'Hao-Ran Sun', 'Ling-Zhi Liu', 'Zeng-Jun Wang', 'Bing-Hua Jiang']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Downregulation of miR-145 associated with cancer progression and VEGF transcriptional activation by targeting N-RAS and IRS1.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor blockade reduces tumor angiogenesis and enhances the effects of bevacizumab for a human gastric cancer cell line, MKN45.', 'IGF-I induces upregulation of DDR1 collagen receptor in breast cancer cells by suppressing MIR-199a-5p through the PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'Inhibition of proliferation of PC-3 human prostate cancer by antagonists of growth hormone-releasing hormone: lack of correlation with the levels of serum IGF-I and expression of tumoral IGF-II and vascular endothelial growth factor.', 'Plasma and tissue insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer and anti-IGF-IR agents as novel therapeutic strategy for refractory cases: a review.', 'Inceptor correlates with markers of prostate cancer progression and modulates insulin/IGF1 signaling and cancer cell migration.', 'Emerging Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Cancer: A Promising Biomarker and Therapeutic Target.', 'Docetaxel suppressed cell proliferation through Smad3/HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Connecting the Dots Between the Gut-IGF-1-Prostate Axis: A Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Carcinogenesis.', 'The Interplay Between Non-coding RNAs and Insulin-Like Growth Factor Signaling in the Pathogenesis of Neoplasia.']"""

Previously, we uncovered that WEE1 phosphorylates histone H2B at tyrosine 37 (pY37-H2B) to negatively regulate global histone transcriptional output. Although pY37-H2B is readily detected in cancer cells, its functional role in pathogenesis is not known. Herein, we show that WEE1 deposits the pY37-H2B marks within the tumor suppressor gene, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), to repress transcription in multiple cancer cells, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs), melanoma and prostate cancer. Consistently, GBMs and primary melanoma tumors that display elevated WEE1 mRNA expression exhibit significant down regulation of the IDH2 gene transcription. IDH2 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), an essential cofactor for the TET family of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases that convert 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC). Significantly, the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 not only abrogated the suppressive H2B Y37-phosphorylation and upregulated IDH2 mRNA levels but also effectively reversed the 'loss of 5-hmC' phenotype in melanomas, GBMs and prostate cancer cells, as well as melanoma xenograft tumors.

However, a substantial proportion of patients eventually becomes refractory due to drug resistance. The detailed mechanisms remain unclear. We have previously reported that Prostate Leucine Zipper (PrLZ), a specific oncogene of prostate cancer (PCa), promotes PCa cell growth at the castration-resistant stage, thus suggesting a vital role of PrLZ in the progression of CRPC. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of PrLZ in docetaxel resistance in PCa, focusing on PrLZ-regulating autophagy pathway. Methods: Human PCa PC3, LNCaP and C4-2 cell lines were used as the model system in vitro and PCa xenografts and PrLZ-knockout mice were used as the model system in vivo. Docetaxel-induced cell death and apoptosis in PCa were determined by MTT and flow cytometry assay. The role of PrLZ on the regulation of autophagy and liver kinase B1/AMP-activated protein kinase (LKB1/AMPK) signaling pathway was analyzed using immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, siRNA silencing and plasmid overexpression. Results: PrLZ increased docetaxel-mediated drug resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic dissection revealed that PrLZ interacted with LKB1 and further inhibited the activation of LKB1/AMPK signals, which negatively contributed to the induction of autophagy. Moreover, PrLZ/LKB1-mediated autophagy conferred resistance to docetaxel-induced cell death and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: These findings identify a novel role of PrLZ in autophagy manipulation and provide new insight into docetaxel chemoresistance in PCa, suggesting a new strategy for treating mCRPC by targeting this newly identified signaling pathway.""","""['Jin Zeng', 'Wei Liu', 'Yi-Zeng Fan', 'Da-Lin He', 'Lei Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Increased PrLZ-mediated androgen receptor transactivation promotes prostate cancer growth at castration-resistant stage.', 'Anti-cancer efficacy of SREBP inhibitor, alone or in combination with docetaxel, in prostate cancer harboring p53 mutations.', 'ADIPOQ/adiponectin induces cytotoxic autophagy in breast cancer cells through STK11/LKB1-mediated activation of the AMPK-ULK1 axis.', 'LKB1/AMPK Pathway and Drug Response in Cancer: A Therapeutic Perspective.', 'AMPK and Cancer.', 'AMPK targets a proto-oncogene TPD52 (isoform 3) expression and its interaction with LKB1 suppress AMPK-GSK3β signaling axis in prostate cancer.', 'A new LKB1 activator, piericidin analogue S14, retards renal fibrosis through promoting autophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis in renal tubular epithelial cells.', 'Expression status and prognostic value of autophagy-related lncRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Choosing Kinase Inhibitors for Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Propolis Ameliorates Alcohol-Induced Depressive Symptoms in C57BL/6J Mice by Regulating Intestinal Mucosal Barrier Function and Inflammatory Reaction.']"""

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between sarcopenia and outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP) for men with prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Using a representative computed tomographic image from the L3 level, preoperative skeletal muscle indices (SMI) calculated for 698 patients who underwent RP between 2007 and 2010. Patients were classified as sarcopenic if they had a SMI < 55 cm2/kg2 according to international consensus. The associations between sarcopenia and biochemical recurrence (BCR), systemic progression (SP), and all-cause mortality (ACM) were investigated by Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Sarcopenic patients were older than nonsarcopenic patients (mean age, 63.0 vs. 60.4 years, P < .001) but were otherwise similar with regard to clinical and pathologic characteristics. There was no significant difference in the perioperative complication rate after RP between sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic patients (16.5% vs. 17.4%, P = .82). At a median follow-up after surgery of 6.0 years, 152 patients were diagnosed with BCR, patients were diagnosed with SP, and 50 patients died. In multivariable analysis, the presence of sarcopenia was not significantly associated with the risks of BCR, SP, or ACM. Similar results were obtained when analyzing SMI as a continuous variable.

Many of these cancers express neuroendocrine markers, which may provide biomarkers for emergence of this disease state. We aimed to quantify the expression of synaptophysin (Syp) on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from serial samples of patients being treated with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide.  Methods:   CTCs were isolated from 44 patients with castration resistant PC before starting abiraterone or enzalutamide, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks on therapy, and at progression. Patients were stratified into 3 groups: de novo resistance, short response, and long response. CTCs were enumerated on the CellSearch platform and Syp expression was quantified using the open fluorescent channel on the platform. Correlative analyses were performed.  Results:   A baseline CTC count of 5 or greater was associated with a more rapid time to progression and increasing CTC counts correlated with emergence of drug resistance. Syp was readily detectable on the surface of CTCs, and baseline percentage CTC Syp expression was significantly associated with time to progression. Furthermore, in evaluable patients, percent CTC Syp expression increased with the emergence of drug resistance. We also found that prior exposure to AR-targeted therapies was inversely associated with progression free survival.  Conclusions:   We have demonstrated that Syp can be quantified on CTCs and that Syp expression correlates with resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide. Larger studies testing Syp as a biomarker of emergence of nonadenocarcinoma disease and as a marker of response to AR-targeted therapies are warranted.""","""['Sumanta K Pal', 'Miaoling He', 'Lin Chen', 'Lixin Yang', 'Raju Pillai', 'Przemyslaw Twardowski', 'JoAnn Hsu', 'Marcin Kortylewski', 'Jeremy O Jones']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Identification of mechanisms of resistance to treatment with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells cluster as a predictive biomarker of abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide treatment in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: targeting the mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide.', 'The effects of enzalutamide and abiraterone on skeletal related events and bone radiological progression free survival in castration resistant prostate cancer patients: An indirect comparison of randomized controlled trials.', 'Endocrine and paracrine characteristics of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Liquid biopsy-based targeted gene screening highlights tumor cell subtypes in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'A Systematic Review of Circulating Tumor Cells Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Salvage therapy for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.']"""

However, a subset of WBCs has overlapping acoustic properties with cancer cells, which is why label-free acoustophoretic cancer cell isolation needs additional purification prior to analysis. This paper reports for the first time a proof of concept for continuous flow acoustophoretic negative selection of WBCs from cancer cells using negative acoustic contrast elastomeric particles (EPs) activated with CD45-antibodies that specifically bind to WBCs. The EP/WBC complexes align at the acoustic pressure anti-nodes along the channel walls while unbound cancer cells focus to the pressure node in the channel center, enabling continuous flow based depletion of WBC background in a cancer cell product. The method does not provide a single process solution for the CTC separation challenge, but provides an elegant part to a multi-step process by further reducing the WBC background in cancer cell separation products derived from an initial step of label-free acoustophoresis. We report the recorded performance of the negative selection immuno-acoustophoretic WBC depletion and cancer cell recovery. To eliminate the negative impact of the separation due to the known problems of aggregation of negative acoustic contrast particles along the sidewalls of the acoustophoresis channel and to enable continuous separation of EP/WBC complexes from cancer cells, a new acoustic actuation method has been implemented where the ultrasound frequency is scanned (1.991MHz ± 100 kHz, scan rate 200 kHz ms-1). Using this frequency scanning strategy EP/WBC complexes were acoustophoretically separated from mixtures of WBCs spiked with breast and prostate cancer cells (DU145 and MCF-7). An 86-fold (MCF-7) and 52-fold (DU145) reduction of WBCs in the cancer cell fractions were recorded with separation efficiencies of 98.6% (MCF-7) and 99.7% (DU145) and cancer cell recoveries of 89.8% (MCF-7) and 85.0% (DU145).""","""['Kevin Cushing', 'Eva Undvall', 'Yvonne Ceder', 'Hans Lilja', 'Thomas Laurell']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['Two-Step Acoustophoresis Separation of Live Tumor Cells from Whole Blood.', 'Microfluidic, label-free enrichment of prostate cancer cells in blood based on acoustophoresis.', 'Acoustic impedance-based size-independent isolation of circulating tumour cells from blood using acoustophoresis.', 'Acoustofluidics 5: Building microfluidic acoustic resonators.', 'Engineering white blood cell membrane-camouflaged nanocarriers for inflammation-related therapeutics.', 'Recent Advances in Microfluidic Platform for Physical and Immunological Detection and Capture of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Recent advances in isolation and detection of circulating tumor cells with a microfluidic system.', 'Two-Step Acoustophoresis Separation of Live Tumor Cells from Whole Blood.', 'Negative enrichment of circulating tumor cells from unmanipulated whole blood with a 3D printed device.', 'Fabrication of tunable, high-molecular-weight polymeric nanoparticles via ultrafast acoustofluidic micromixing.']"""

Simultaneous pubic debridement with simple cystectomy and diversion was used for management in all cases. One patient died postoperatively with the remainder recovering well without PO or fistula recurrence, with a median follow-up of 16 months.  Conclusion:   UF can occur as a complication of endoscopic treatment of posterior urethral stricture in patients with a history of radiation therapy for prostate cancer. This study demonstrates that UF and PO may develop even with minimally traumatic procedures and sterile urine. All patients treated for posterior stricture must be considered at risk of development of fistulas and osteomyelitis.""","""['Daniel D Shapiro', 'David C Goodspeed', 'Wade Bushman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Pubectomy and urinary reconstruction provides definitive treatment of urosymphyseal fistula following prostate cancer treatment.', 'Robot Assisted Cystectomy With Holmium Laser Debridement for Osteomyelitis of the Pubic Symphysis With Urinary Fistula.', 'Robotic Puboprostatic Fistula Repair with Holmium Laser Pubic Debridement.', 'Resection of Pubic Symphysis and Cystectomy Significantly Improves Short-Term Patient-Reported Physical Functioning Among Patients With Pubovesical Fistula and Pubic Bone Osteomyelitis.', 'Urethral strictures and the cancer survivor.', 'Corpus spongiosum flap: a unique technique in the management of urosymphyseal fistula.', 'Pubic symphysis septic arthritis due to urosymphyseal fistula: Conservative management can work.', 'Simultaneous treatment of a pubovesical fistula and lymph node metastasis secondary to multimodal treatment for prostate cancer: Case report and review of the literature.', 'Devastated Bladder Outlet in Pelvic Cancer Survivors: Issues on Surgical Reconstruction and Quality of Life.', 'Urosymphyseal fistulas in women: identification and characterization of a previously undescribed phenomenon.']"""

However, there are only a few reports on its effects on human prostate cancer cells. Thus, we investigated the anti-proliferative effects of fenofibrate on human prostate cancer cells and potential mechanisms. The methods used include cell viability analysis with an MTT assay, as well as apoptosis and related signaling pathway analyses with flow cytometry and Western blotting. Fenofibrate inhibited PC-3 cell growth in dose- and time-dependent manners. The fenofibrate-induced cell death is predominantly apoptotic death that is mediated by both the caspase-3 activation and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) signaling pathways. Fenofibrate also increased the expression of Bad and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin. Mechanistically, fenofibrate-induced cell death was associated with decreased p-p70S6K and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation levels. When further exploring the upstream mediators of mTOR/p70S6K, we found that fenofibrate increased p38 MAPK and AMPK phosphorylation but did not significantly change the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and JNK. However, the inhibition of either p38 MAPK or AMPK with their specific inhibitor did not change the effect of fenofibrate-induced cell death. These findings suggested that fenofibrate indeed significantly inhibited the proliferation of PC-3 cells via apoptotic action, which is associated with the inactivation of the mTOR/p70S6K-dependent cell survival pathway. Although the mechanisms by which fenofibrate inactivates this pathway remains unclear, this study reveals great potential for its use for the clinical treatment of prostate cancers.""","""['Xin Lian', 'Junlian Gu', 'Baoshan Gao', 'Yan Li', 'Chendil Damodaran', 'Wei Wei', 'Yaowen Fu', 'Lu Cai']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Embelin inhibits growth and induces apoptosis through the suppression of Akt/mTOR/S6K1 signaling cascades.', 'mTOR is a fine tuning molecule in CDK inhibitors-induced distinct cell death mechanisms via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Brassinin induces apoptosis in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells through the suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6K1 signaling cascades.', 'Precision therapy to target apoptosis in prostate cancer.', 'Anticancer Properties of Fenofibrate: A Repurposing Use.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Fenofibrate for COVID-19 and related complications as an approach to improve treatment outcomes: the missed key for Holy Grail.', 'miR-301-3p directly regulates Cx43 to mediate the development of gastric cancer.', 'OxLDL as an Inducer of a Metabolic Shift in Cancer Cells.', 'Inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway in Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention and Intervention.']"""

To improve experiment productivity, researchers computationally infer potential associations from biological data, selecting the most promising candidates for experimental verification. Predicting potential miRNA-disease association has become a research area of growing importance. This paper presents a model of Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine for MiRNA-Disease Association (EGBMMDA) prediction by integrating the miRNA functional similarity, the disease semantic similarity, and known miRNA-disease associations. The statistical measures, graph theoretical measures, and matrix factorization results for each miRNA-disease pair were calculated and used to form an informative feature vector. The vector for known associated pairs obtained from the HMDD v2.0 database was used to train a regression tree under the gradient boosting framework. EGBMMDA was the first decision tree learning-based model used for predicting miRNA-disease associations. Respectively, AUCs of 0.9123 and 0.8221 in global and local leave-one-out cross-validation proved the model's reliable performance. Moreover, the 0.9048 ± 0.0012 AUC in fivefold cross-validation confirmed its stability. We carried out three different types of case studies of predicting potential miRNAs related to Colon Neoplasms, Lymphoma, Prostate Neoplasms, Breast Neoplasms, and Esophageal Neoplasms. The results indicated that, respectively, 98%, 90%, 98%, 100%, and 98% of the top 50 predictions for the five diseases were confirmed by experiments. Therefore, EGBMMDA appears to be a useful computational resource for miRNA-disease association prediction.""","""['Xing Chen', 'Li Huang', 'Di Xie', 'Qi Zhao']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['MDHGI: Matrix Decomposition and Heterogeneous Graph Inference for miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'GIMDA: Graphlet interaction-based MiRNA-disease association prediction.', 'An improved random forest-based computational model for predicting novel miRNA-disease associations.', 'Review of MiRNA-Disease Association Prediction.', 'MicroRNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'KATZNCP: a miRNA-disease association prediction model integrating KATZ algorithm and network consistency projection.', 'Empirical Analysis of Impact of Weather and Air Pollution Parameters on COVID-19 Spread and Control in India Using Machine Learning Algorithm.', 'Prediction of miRNA-disease associations in microbes based on graph convolutional networks and autoencoders.', 'EccBase: A high-quality database for exploration and characterization of extrachromosomal circular DNAs in cancer.', 'Predicting miRNA-disease associations based on PPMI and attention network.']"""

Methods:   We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study of men treated for nonmetastatic prostate cancer in Ontario, Canada, from 2002 to 2009. Patients treated with surgery and radiotherapy were matched on demographics, comorbidity, and cardiovascular risk factors. The primary outcome was non-prostate cancer mortality. Outcomes were compared using the Fine and Gray subdistribution method with generalized estimating equations. We used a previously published technique to quantify the prevalence and strength of residual confounding necessary to account for observed results.  Results:   We examined 5393 pairs of matched men. The 10-year cumulative incidence of non-prostate cancer mortality was higher among patients who underwent radiotherapy (12%) than surgery (8%; adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [HR] 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.35-1.83). Patients treated with radiotherapy also had an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.27-2.37). Hypothetical residual confounders would have to be both strongly associated with non-prostate cancer mortality (HRs > 2.5) and have highly differential prevalence to nullify the observed effect.  Conclusion:   Among patients carefully matched on cardiovascular risk factors, those treated with radiotherapy had an increased risk of non-prostate cancer mortality and cardiovascular disease. Because of the observational nature of the data, the potential for confounding remains.

Methods and materials:   From 2011 through 2013, 66 men were accrued to a phase 2 trial at 5 centers. SBRT consisted of 5 fractions of 7.4 Gy to a total dose of 37 Gy using conventional linear accelerators. Electromagnetic transponders were used for motion management. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was evaluated via the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26 questionnaire. Acute and late toxicities were collected according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Linear mixed modeling was performed to assess changes in HRQOL over time.  Results:   Median follow-up was 36 months. All men had low- or intermediate-risk disease. There have been 0 biochemical recurrences. No grade 3 urinary or bowel toxicity was reported. Twenty-three percent of patients had acute grade 2 urinary toxicity, with 9% late grade 2 urinary toxicity. Four percent and 5% experienced acute or late grade 2+ bowel toxicity, respectively. Urinary bother and bowel HRQOL transiently decreased during the first 6 to 12 months post-SBRT, and then returned to baseline. In men with good erectile function at baseline, sexual HRQOL declined during the first 6 months and stabilized thereafter. On linear mixed modeling, the strongest predictor of sustained bowel and sexual HRQOL was baseline HRQOL.

BCAR1 expression levels were compared with clinical characteristics, PSA recurrence, molecular subtype defined by ERG status and 3p, 5q, 6q and PTEN deletion.  Results:   BCAR1 staining was barely detectable in normal prostate glands but seen in 77.6% of 9472 interpretable cancers, including strong expression in 38.5%, moderate in 23.2% and weak in 15.9% of cases. BCAR1 up regulation was associated with positive ERG status (p < 0.0001), high Gleason score (p < 0.0001), advanced pathological tumor stage (p = 0.0082), lower preoperative PSA level (p < 0.0001), increased cell proliferation (p < 0.0001), early PSA recurrence (p = 0.0008), and predicted prognosis independently from clinico-pathological parameters available at the time of the initial biopsy. However, subset analyses revealed that the prognostic impact of BCAR1 expression was limited to ERG-negative cancer. That BCAR1 up regulation was linked to almost all analyzed deletions (p < 0.0001 each for PTEN, 5q, 6q deletion) may suggest a functional link to genomic instability.

Lesion maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax), organ SUVmean and standard deviation were measured. Deidentified reconstructions (OSEM, PSF, BPL using β200-600) from 10 cases were visually analysed by two readers who indicated their most and least preferred reconstructions, and scored overall image quality, noise level, background marrow image quality and lesion conspicuity.  Results:   Comparing BPL to OSEM, there were significant increments in lesion SUVmax and signal-to-background up to β400, with highest gain in β100 reconstructions (mean ΔSUVmax 3.9, p < 0.0001). Organ noise levels increased on PSF, β100 and β200 reconstructions.

Conclusion:   BPL reconstruction of 18F-fluciclovine PET images improves signal-to-noise ratio, affirmed by overall reader preferences. On balance, β300 is suggested for 18F-fluciclovine whole body PET image reconstruction using BPL.

Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 309 consecutive patients with CRPC treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide. Of these, 101 men (33%) had available primary tumor tissue for analysis. We screened for deleterious TP53 missense mutations and PTEN deletions using genetically validated immunohistochemical assays for nuclear accumulation of p53 protein and PTEN protein loss, with sequencing confirmation of TP53 mutations in a subset. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between patients with and without p53 and/or PTEN alterations.  Results:   Forty-eight percent of the evaluable cases had PTEN loss and 27% had p53 nuclear accumulation. OS and PFS did not differ according to PTEN status, but were significantly associated with p53 status. Median OS was 16.7 months (95% CI, 14-21.9 months) and 31.2 months (95% CI, 24.5-43.4) for men with and without p53 nuclear accumulation, respectively (HR 2.32; 95% CI 1.19-4.51; P = 0.0018).

N-alkylated polyamine analogues are polyamine antimetabolites with proven anticancer efficacy. We have characterized earlier the preferred metabolic routes of N1,N12-diethylspermine (DESpm), N1-benzyl-N12-ethylspermine (BnEtSpm) and N1,N12-dibenzylspermine (DBSpm) by human recombinant spermine oxidase (SMOX) and acetylpolyamine oxidase (APAO). Here, we studied the above analogues, their variably deuterated counterparts and their metabolites as substrates and inhibitors of APAO, SMOX, semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), diamine oxidase (DAO) and monoamine oxidases. We found that targeted deuteration efficiently redirected the preferable cleavage site and suppressed reaction rate by APAO and SMOX in vitro We found a three- to six-fold decline in Vmax with moderate variable effect on Km when deuterium was located at the preferred hydrogen abstraction site of the analogue. We also found some of the metabolites to be potent inhibitors of DAO and SSAO. Surprisingly, analogue deuteration did not markedly alter the anti-proliferative efficacy of the drugs in DU145 prostate cancer cells, while in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which had higher basal APAO and SMOX activities, moderate effect was observed. Interestingly, the anti-proliferative efficacy of the analogues did not correlate with their ability to suppress polyamine biosynthetic enzymes, induce spermidine/spermine-N1-acetyltransferase or deplete intracellular polyamine levels, but correlated with their ability to induce SMOX. Our data show that selective deuteration of N-alkyl polyamine analogues enables metabolic switching, offering the means for selective generation of bioactive metabolites inhibiting, e.g. SSAO and DAO, thus setting a novel basis for in vivo studies of this class of analogues.""","""['Sebahat Ucal', 'Merja R Häkkinen', 'Aino-Liisa Alanne', 'Leena Alhonen', 'Jouko Vepsäläinen', 'Tuomo A Keinänen', 'Mervi T Hyvönen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem J""","""['Exploring the activity of polyamine analogues on polyamine and spermine oxidase: methoctramine, a potent and selective inhibitor of polyamine oxidase.', 'Metabolism of N-alkylated spermine analogues by polyamine and spermine oxidases.', 'Controlling the regioselectivity and stereospecificity of FAD-dependent polyamine oxidases with the use of amine-attached guide molecules as conformational modulators.', 'Catabolism of polyamines.', 'The role of polyamine catabolism in anti-tumour drug response.', 'Twelfth-Position Deuteration of Nevirapine Reduces 12-Hydroxy-Nevirapine Formation and Nevirapine-Induced Hepatocyte Death.', 'Unforeseen Possibilities To Investigate the Regulation of Polyamine Metabolism Revealed by Novel C-Methylated Spermine Derivatives.', 'Exploring the activity of polyamine analogues on polyamine and spermine oxidase: methoctramine, a potent and selective inhibitor of polyamine oxidase.', 'Cellular and Animal Model Studies on the Growth Inhibitory Effects of Polyamine Analogues on Breast Cancer.']"""

A rising level of prostate-specific antigen after radical prostatectomy indicates prostate cancer recurrence, and these patients may still be cured with salvage radiotherapy. To maximize chance for cure, the irradiated volumes should completely encompass the extent of disease. Therefore, accurate estimation of the location of disease is critical for radiotherapy planning in both the definitive and the salvage settings. Current first-line imaging for prostate cancer has limited sensitivity for detection of disease both at initial staging and at biochemical recurrence. Integration of PET into routine evaluation of prostate cancer patients may improve both staging accuracy and radiotherapy planning. 18F-FDG PET/CT is now routinely used in radiation planning for several cancer types. However, 18F-FDG PET/CT has low sensitivity for prostate cancer. Additional PET probes evaluated in prostate cancer include 18F-sodium fluoride, 11C-acetate, 11C- or 18F-choline, 18F-fluciclovine, and 68Ga- or 18F-labeled ligands that bind prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA ligands appear to be the most sensitive and specific but have not yet received Food and Drug Administration New Drug Application approval for use in the United States. Retrospective and prospective investigations suggest a potential major impact of PET/CT on prostate radiation treatment planning. Prospective trials randomizing patients to routine radiotherapy planning versus PET/CT-aided planning may show meaningful clinical outcomes. Prospective clinical trials evaluating the addition of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT for planning of salvage radiotherapy with clinical endpoints are under way.

Patients with AR-V7-positive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have greater benefit of taxane chemotherapy compared with novel hormonal therapies, indicating a treatment-selection biomarker. Likewise, in those with pancreatic cancer (PaCa), KRAS mutations act as prognostic biomarkers. Thus, there is an urgent need for technology investigating the expression and mutation status of CTCs. Here, we report an approach that adds AR-V7 or KRAS status to CTC enumeration, compatible with multiple CTC-isolation platforms.  Methods:   We studied 3 independent CTC-isolation devices (CellCollector, Parsortix, CellSearch) for the evaluation of AR-V7 or KRAS status of CTCs with in situ padlock probe technology. Padlock probes allow highly specific detection and visualization of transcripts on a cellular level. We applied padlock probes for detecting AR-V7, androgen receptor full length (AR-FL), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in CRPC and KRAS wild-type (wt) and mutant (mut) transcripts in PaCa in CTCs from 46 patients.  Results:   In situ analysis showed that 71% (22 of 31) of CRPC patients had detectable AR-V7 expression ranging from low to high expression [1-76 rolling circle products (RCPs)/CTC]. In PaCa patients, 40% (6 of 15) had KRAS mut expressing CTCs with 1 to 8 RCPs/CTC. In situ padlock probe analysis revealed CTCs with no detectable cytokeratin expression but positivity for AR-V7 or KRAS mut transcripts.

We established a sensitive and high-throughput strategy for analyzing prostate circulating tumor cells (CTC) using microfluidic cell enrichment followed by digital quantitation of prostate-derived transcripts. In a prospective study of 27 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with first-line abiraterone, pretreatment elevation of the digital CTCM score identifies a high-risk population with poor overall survival (HR = 6.0; P = 0.01) and short radiographic progression-free survival (HR = 3.2; P = 0.046). Expression of HOXB13 in CTCs identifies 6 of 6 patients with ≤12-month survival, with a subset also expressing the ARV7 splice variant. In a second cohort of 34 men with localized prostate cancer, an elevated preoperative CTCL score predicts microscopic dissemination to seminal vesicles and/or lymph nodes (P < 0.001). Thus, digital quantitation of CTC-specific transcripts enables noninvasive monitoring that may guide treatment selection in both metastatic and localized prostate cancer.Significance: There is an unmet need for biomarkers to guide prostate cancer therapies, for curative treatment of localized cancer and for application of molecularly targeted agents in metastatic disease. Digital quantitation of prostate CTC-derived transcripts in blood specimens is predictive of abiraterone response in metastatic cancer and of early dissemination in localized cancer.

Although this process has been reported to participate in diverse cellular signaling, little is known about its role in cancer cell migration. Given a recent proteomics report showing that NEDD8 is downregulated in prostate cancer tissues versus normal prostate tissues, we tested the possibility that neddylation plays a role in cancer evolution, and then tried to identify target proteins of the neddylation.  Methods:   The neddylation process was inhibited by transfecting cancer cells with NEDD8-targeting siRNAs or by treating the cells with a NAE1 inhibitor MLN4924. Cell migration was evaluated by an in vitro wound-healing assay and a Transwell migration assay. His/NEDD8-conjugated proteins were pulled down with nickel-affinity beads under a denaturing condition, and identified by Western blotting. All data were processed using the Microsoft Excel program and analyzed statistically by two-sided, unpaired Student's t-test.  Results:   Caveolin-1, which plays a critical role in cell migration, was identified to be conjugated with NEDD8. When the neddylation was inhibited, the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 at Tyr14 was augmented in PC3 and U373MG cells, thereby leading to increased cell migration. Such consequences by neddylation inhibition were abolished in the presence of a Src family kinase inhibitor PP2.  Conclusions:   NEDD8 seems to inhibit the Src-mediated phosphorylation of caveolin-1 by modifying the structure of caveolin-1 protein, which blocks the migration of cancer cells. Although the neddylation process is currently regarded as an emerging target for cancer therapy, our results suggest the possibility that the inhibition of neddylation could facilitate cancer invasion or metastasis at least in some types of cancers.""","""['Sung Yeon Park', 'Jong-Wan Park', 'Gun-Woo Lee', 'Lan Li', 'Yang-Sook Chun']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Inhibition of neddylation modification by MLN4924 sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma cells to sorafenib.', 'Validation of NEDD8-conjugating enzyme UBC12 as a new therapeutic target in lung cancer.', 'Overactivated neddylation pathway as a therapeutic target in lung cancer.', 'Pharmaceutical Inhibition of Neddylation as Promising Treatments for Various Cancers.', 'Neddylation: a novel modulator of the tumor microenvironment.', 'Biomarkers Found in the Tumor Interstitial Fluid may Help Explain the Differential Behavior Among Keratinocyte Carcinomas.', 'Pharmacological Activation of Potassium Channel Kv11.1 with NS1643 Attenuates Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cell Migration by Promoting the Dephosphorylation of Caveolin-1.', 'Molecular mechanisms underlying the promotion of wound repair by coenzyme Q10: PI3K/Akt signal activation via alterations to cell membrane domains.', 'The Cellular and Developmental Roles of Cullins, Neddylation, and the COP9 Signalosome in Dictyostelium discoideum.', 'EPS364, a Novel Deep-Sea Bacterial Exopolysaccharide, Inhibits Liver Cancer Cell Growth and Adhesion.']"""

UV-Vis analysis of R. suaveolens synthesized AgNPs (RS-AgNPs) showed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peak at 426 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that RS-AgNPs were 10-30 nm in size with spherical shape. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of RS-AgNPs confirmed the crystalline nature with face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) interprets that polyphenols and proteins take part in bioreduction and capping of RS-AgNPs. RS-AgNPs exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of different cancer cells including DU145 and PC-3(human prostate carcinoma cell lines), SKOV3 (human ovarian carcinoma) and A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma)with IC50 values of 4.35, 7.72, 4.2 and 24.7 μg/mL, respectively. The plausible reasons behind anticancer activity of RS-AgNPs were explained using different assays on the most susceptible SKOV3 cells. RS-AgNPs induced oxidative stress in SKOV3 cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhancing lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels and decreasing glutathione (GSH) levels. RS-AgNPs induced the apoptosis of SKOV3 cells by up regulating the caspase-3, caspase -8, caspase -9, p53 and BAX and down regulating the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Further, RS-AgNPs showed elevation of caspase 3/7 activity and also exhibited antimigratory effect by inhibiting the migration of SKOV3 cells into the wounded area. The findings suggested that biogenic RS-AgNPs provide an alternative approach to overcome several limitations of chemotherapy.""","""['Murali Satyanarayana Bethu', 'Vasudeva Reddy Netala', 'Latha Domdi', 'Vijaya Tartte', 'Venkateswara Rao Janapala']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol""","""['Exploiting antidiabetic activity of silver nanoparticles synthesized using Punica granatum leaves and anticancer potential against human liver cancer cells (HepG2).', 'Ecofriendly synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles by Euphrasia officinalis leaf extract and its biomedical applications.', 'Phytosynthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Using Perilla frutescens Leaf Extract: Characterization and Evaluation of Antibacterial, Antioxidant, and Anticancer Activities.', 'Pharmaceutical Aspects of Green Synthesized Silver Nanoparticles: A Boon to Cancer Treatment.', 'Silver nanoparticles: Synthesis, medical applications and biosafety.', 'Biomedical Applications of Biosynthesized Nickel Oxide Nanoparticles.', 'Reports of Plant-Derived Nanoparticles for Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Green Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Using the Leaf Extract of the Medicinal Plant, Uvaria narum and Its Antibacterial, Antiangiogenic, Anticancer and Catalytic Properties.', 'The Role of Silver Nanoparticles in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer: Are There Any Perspectives for the Future?', 'Glucose-Functionalized Silver Nanoparticles as a Potential New Therapy Agent Targeting Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer cells.']"""

The IMPACT study is evaluating PSA screening in men with a known genetic predisposition to PrCa due to BRCA1/2 mutations. This analysis evaluates the utility of PSA and PSAV for identifying PrCa and high-grade disease in this cohort.  Methods:   PSAV was calculated using logistic regression to determine if PSA or PSAV predicted the result of prostate biopsy (PB) in men with elevated PSA values. Cox regression was used to determine whether PSA or PSAV predicted PSA elevation in men with low PSAs. Interaction terms were included in the models to determine whether BRCA status influenced the predictiveness of PSA or PSAV.  Results:   1634 participants had ⩾3 PSA readings of whom 174 underwent PB and 45 PrCas diagnosed. In men with PSA >3.0 ng ml-l, PSAV was not significantly associated with presence of cancer or high-grade disease. PSAV did not add to PSA for predicting time to an elevated PSA. When comparing BRCA1/2 carriers to non-carriers, we found a significant interaction between BRCA status and last PSA before biopsy (P=0.031) and BRCA2 status and PSAV (P=0.024). However, PSAV was not predictive of biopsy outcome in BRCA2 carriers.  Conclusions:   PSA is more strongly predictive of PrCa in BRCA carriers than non-carriers. We did not find evidence that PSAV aids decision-making for BRCA carriers over absolute PSA value alone.""","""['Christos Mikropoulos', 'Christina G Hutten Selkirk', 'Sibel Saya', 'Elizabeth Bancroft', 'Emily Vertosick', 'Tokhir Dadaev', 'Charles Brendler', 'Elizabeth Page', 'Alexander Dias', 'D Gareth Evans', 'Jeanette Rothwell', 'Lovise Maehle', 'Karol Axcrona', 'Kate Richardson', 'Diana Eccles', 'Thomas Jensen', 'Palle J Osther', 'Christi J van Asperen', 'Hans Vasen', 'Lambertus A Kiemeney', 'Janneke Ringelberg', 'Cezary Cybulski', 'Dominika Wokolorczyk', 'Rachel Hart', 'Wayne Glover', 'Jimmy Lam', 'Louise Taylor', 'Monica Salinas', 'Lidia Feliubadaló', 'Rogier Oldenburg', 'Ruben Cremers', 'Gerald Verhaegh', 'Wendy A van Zelst-Stams', 'Jan C Oosterwijk', 'Jackie Cook', 'Derek J Rosario', 'Saundra S Buys', 'Tom Conner', 'Susan Domchek', 'Jacquelyn Powers', 'Margreet Gem Ausems', 'Manuel R Teixeira', 'Sofia Maia', 'Louise Izatt', 'Rita Schmutzler', 'Kerstin Rhiem', 'William D Foulkes', 'Talia Boshari', 'Rosemarie Davidson', 'Marielle Ruijs', 'Apollonia Tjm Helderman-van den Enden', 'Lesley Andrews', 'Lisa Walker', 'Katie Snape', 'Alex Henderson', 'Irene Jobson', 'Geoffrey J Lindeman', 'Annelie Liljegren', 'Marion Harris', 'Muriel A Adank', 'Judy Kirk', 'Amy Taylor', 'Rachel Susman', 'Rakefet Chen-Shtoyerman', 'Nicholas Pachter', 'Allan Spigelman', 'Lucy Side', 'Janez Zgajnar', 'Josefina Mora', 'Carole Brewer', 'Neus Gadea', 'Angela F Brady', 'David Gallagher', 'Theo van Os', 'Alan Donaldson', 'Vigdis Stefansdottir', 'Julian Barwell', 'Paul A James', 'Declan Murphy', 'Eitan Friedman', 'Nicola Nicolai', 'Lynn Greenhalgh', 'Elias Obeid', 'Vedang Murthy', 'Lucia Copakova', 'John McGrath', 'Soo-Hwang Teo', 'Sara Strom', 'Karin Kast', 'Daniel A Leongamornlert', 'Anthony Chamberlain', 'Jenny Pope', 'Anna C Newlin', 'Neil Aaronson', 'Audrey Ardern-Jones', 'Chris Bangma', 'Elena Castro', 'David Dearnaley', 'Jorunn Eyfjord', 'Alison Falconer', 'Christopher S Foster', 'Henrik Gronberg', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Oskar Johannsson', 'Vincent Khoo', 'Jan Lubinski', 'Eli Marie Grindedal', 'Joanne McKinley', 'Kylie Shackleton', 'Anita V Mitra', 'Clare Moynihan', 'Gad Rennert', 'Mohnish Suri', 'Karen Tricker;IMPACT study collaborators;Sue Moss', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Andrew Vickers', 'Hans Lilja', 'Brian T Helfand', 'Rosalind A Eeles']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Prostate-specific antigen velocity in a prospective prostate cancer screening study of men with genetic predisposition.', 'Interim Results from the IMPACT Study: Evidence for Prostate-specific Antigen Screening in BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.', 'Prostate-specific antigen velocity for early detection of prostate cancer: result from a large, representative, population-based cohort.', 'Targeted prostate cancer screening in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers: results from the initial screening round of the IMPACT study.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening in a New Era of Genetics.', 'The role of prostate-specific antigen velocity in prostate cancer early detection.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: protocol for updating multiple systematic reviews to inform a Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care guideline update.', 'Hereditary Prostate Cancer: Genes Related, Target Therapy and Prevention.']"""

It has previously been shown that HDGF is overregulated in prostate cancer cells compared to normal prostate cells, which is correlated with cellular migration and invasion of prostate cancer. Here, the molecular mechanisms of HDGF in prostate cancer is investigated. It is shown that HDGF knockdown reduces prostate cancer cellular migration and invasion in both androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells and androgen-insensitive DU145 and PC3 cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis reveals that HDGF knockdown inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of prostate cancer cells by upregulation of protein E-cadherin and downregulation of proteins N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail and Slug. In addition, mechanistic studies reveal that proteins MMP2 and MMP9 are down-regulated. In conclusion, our data suggested that HDGF knockdown inhibits cellular migration and invasion in vitro of prostate cancer via modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathway, as well as MMP2 and MMP9 signaling pathway. These results supported that HDGF is a relevant protein in the progression of prostate cancer and may serve as a potentially therapeutic target for prostate cancer as well as its downstream targets.""","""['Feilong Yang', 'Nengwang Yu', 'Hui Wang', 'Cong Zhang', 'Zhao Zhang', 'Yanxiang Li', 'Dawei Li', 'Lei Yan', 'Hainan Liu', 'Zhonghua Xu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Hepatoma-derived growth factor regulates breast cancer cell invasion by modulating epithelial--mesenchymal transition.', 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Various effects of hepatoma-derived growth factor on cell growth, migration and invasion of breast cancer and prostate cancer cells.', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Prostate Cancer.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer: an overview.', 'LncNAP1L6 activates MMP pathway by stabilizing the m6A-modified NAP1L2 to promote malignant progression in prostate cancer.', 'A thioredoxin reductase 1 inhibitor pyrano 3,2-a phenazine inhibits A549 cells proliferation and migration through the induction of reactive oxygen species production.', 'MiR-129-5p exerts Wnt signaling-dependent tumor-suppressive functions in hepatocellular carcinoma by directly targeting hepatoma-derived growth factor HDGF.', 'MicroRNA MiR-490-5p suppresses pancreatic cancer through regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition via targeting MAGI2 antisense RNA 3.', 'Silencing miRNA-1297 suppresses the invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells via targeting modulation of PTEN and blocking of the AKT/ERK pathway.']"""

These correlations were investigated in this study. Two separate trials were undertaken, the first a thirty-five patient cohort with three observers, the second a five patient dataset with ten observers. Clinical and planning target volumes (CTV and PTV), rectum, and bladder were independently contoured by all observers in each trial. Structures were contoured on T2-weighted MRI and transferred onto CT following rigid registration for treatment planning in the first trial. Structures were contoured directly on CT in the second trial. STAPLE and majority voting volumes were generated as reference gold standard volumes for each structure for the two trials respectively. VMAT treatment plans (78 Gy to PTV) were simulated for observer and gold standard volumes, and dosimetry assessed using multiple radiobiological metrics. Correlations between contouring similarity metrics and dosimetry were calculated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. No correlations were observed between contouring similarity metrics and dosimetry for CTV within either trial. Volume similarity correlated most strongly with radiobiological metrics for PTV in both trials, including TCPPoisson (ρ = 0.57, 0.65), TCPLogit (ρ = 0.39, 0.62), and EUD (ρ = 0.43, 0.61) for each respective trial. Rectum and bladder metric correlations displayed no consistency for the two trials. PTV volume similarity was found to significantly correlate with rectum normal tissue complication probability (ρ = 0.33, 0.48). Minimal to no correlations with dosimetry were observed for overlap or boundary contouring metrics.

Patients received 120 ml Iohexol in DCE-CT and a low dose of (0.015 mM kg-1) of gadobenate dimeglumine in DCE-MRI. The AIFs were measured in the iliac artery and normalized to the CT and MRI contrast agent doses.

Then numerical AIFs (AIFCT and AIFMRI) were calculated based on fitting parameters. The AIFMRI was convolved with a 'contrast agent injection' function ([Formula: see text]) to correct for the difference between MRI and CT contrast agent injection times (~1.5 s versus 30 s). The results show that the EMMs accurately fitted AIFs measured from CT and MRI.

CSCs are considered responsible for tumor recurrence, distant metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug or radiation resistance. CSCs also are resistant to apoptosis. Zoledronic acid (ZA) is a third generation bisphosphonate that reduces cell proliferation and exhibits anti-tumor effects by inducing cell death in some malignancies; however, the effects of ZA on CSCs are unclear. We investigated the anti-cancer effects of ZA on two epithelial cancer cell lines, prostate DU-145 and breast MCF7, focusing primarily on induction and activation of apoptosis. Cluster of differentiation (CD) 133+/CD44+ prostate CSCs and CD 44+/CD24 breast CSCs were isolated from the DU-145 human prostate cancer and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines, respectively, using FACSAria flow cytometry cell sorting. CSCs and non-CSCs were exposed to increasing concentrations of ZA for 24, 48 and 72 h to determine the IC50 dose. Annexin-V assay for detecting cell death and cell cycle was performed using the Muse™ Cell Analyzer. Prostate CSCs and non-CSCs were assayed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) array for detecting 84 key apoptosis related genes. Gene regulation at the protein level was investigated by immunofluorescence. ZA caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability. Treatment with ZA resulted in a concomitant increase in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at S-phase in CSCs. Significant over/under-expressions were detected in seven of the genes of ZA-treated DU-145 CSCs cells. Expressions of CASP9, CASP4, BAX and BAD genes increased, while the expressions of BIRC3, BIRC2 and BCL2 genes decreased. In the DU-145 non-CSCs, five genes exhibited changes in gene expression after ZA treatment, two exhibited increased expression (CASP7 and BAD) and three exhibited decreased expression (BIRC3, BIRC2 and BCL2). ZA caused cell death of drug resistant breast MCF-7 and prostate DU-145 cancer stem cells by activating apoptosis. ZA can facilitate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in human prostate CSCs by down-regulating anti-apoptotic genes and up-regulating pro-apoptotic genes.

The exact working mechanisms of LDMC have not been established, although anti-angiogenic effects have been identified. In PC, several studies show clinical effects from LDMC but the mode of action and the role of androgen signaling for its effect are not known. In this study, we used a xenograft model to evaluate the effect of LDMC on PC growth in relation to androgen deprivation.  Material and methods:   Subcutaneous human castration-resistant PC xenografts were treated with LDMC using cyclophosphamide (CPA). Treatment effect was compared to treatment with maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and also between intact and castrated mice. Microvessel density (MVD), and factors important for angiogenesis were analyzed with immunohistochemistry and real-time-PCR.  Results:   Tumors treated with LDMC were 50% smaller than untreated controls. Tumors in non-castrated mice were not affected by LDMC, but in an androgen receptor (AR) negative tumor model, tumor inhibiting effect were seen in both intact and castrated animals, indicating mechanism via AR. MTD resulted in similar growth inhibition as LDMC in castrated mice, but resulted in severe weight loss. Despite that LDMC induced TSP1 mRNA expression, and the hypoxic area in the tumors was slightly increased, no decrease in MVD was detected.  Conclusions:   This study shows that a low-dose metronomic scheduling of CPA was as efficient as MTD treatment, and resulted in fewer side effects.

Methods:   Patients ≥ 70 years with CRPC starting a new line of treatment were included in a prospective cohort study. A geriatric assessment (CGA) was performed at baseline, including comorbidity, mobility, functional/mental/nutritional status, as well as depression. Furthermore, pain intensity, quality of life, ECOG-performance status, and physicians' and patients' perception of health were documented. Reasons for and factors associated with discontinuation of scheduled treatment were analysed by univariate and multivariate analysis.  Results:   After inclusion of 177 of 300 planned patients, the study was closed due to slow recruitment. 160 patients were eligible for final analysis. Median age was 77.5 years. 46% received chemotherapy, and 54% hormonal treatment. Discontinuation of scheduled treatment occurred in 91 patients (57.6%). The main reasons were progressive disease/death in 63%, adverse events/toxicity in 22%, and withdrawal of consent in 8%. In bivariate analyses, factors associated with discontinuation of treatment were age ≥ 80 years, ECOG PS ≥ 2, compromised/poor health status (physicians'/patients' assessment), and compromised functional or nutritional status. In multivariate analysis, the only remaining factor independently associated with discontinuation of scheduled treatment was impairment of activities of daily living (ADL < 100 points) (OR = 4.2 for discontinuation; p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   Despite limitations due to early termination of the study, our results demonstrate that discontinuation of scheduled treatment was common, and that compromised ADL seems to be a significant risk factor for treatment failure in elderly patients with CRPC.""","""['Friedemann Honecker', 'Ulrich Wedding', 'Gerd Kallischnigg', 'Axel Schroeder', 'Jörg Klier', 'Thomas Frangenheim', 'Lothar Weißbach']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Prediction of unplanned discontinuation of treatment in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer-results from the IBuTu study.', 'Docetaxel-based chemotherapy in elderly patients (age 75 and older) with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus prednisone alone in chemotherapy-naive men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: patient-reported outcome results of a randomised phase 3 trial.', 'The effect of geriatric intervention in frail elderly patients receiving chemotherapy for colorectal cancer: a randomized trial (GERICO).', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in very elderly patients: challenges and solutions.', 'Comparison of Systemic Treatments for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer After Docetaxel Failure: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.', 'Factors Associated with Refusal or Discontinuation of Treatment in Patients with Bladder Cancer: A Cohort Population-Based Study in Taiwan.', 'Medication Reconciliation Associated with Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment in Older Patients with Cancer: ChimioAge Study.', 'Patient and caregiver benefit-risk preferences for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment.', 'Nutritional status according to the mini nutritional assessment (MNA)® as potential prognostic factor for health and treatment outcomes in patients with cancer - a systematic review.']"""

Cox proportional hazards regression was done to identify factors associated with overall survival (OS). RPA was performed to identify factors to classify patients into distinct risk groups with respect to OS. A total of 444 patients were eligible.

To this end, we previously reported the efficacy of a therapeutic peptide called CT20p that displays selective cytotoxicity through inhibition of a multi-subunit, protein-folding complex called Chaperonin-Containing TCP-1 (CCT). To investigate the role of CCT in cancer progression, we examined protein levels of CCT subunits in liver, prostate, and lung cancer using human tissue microarrays. We found that these cancers expressed higher levels of CCT2 as compared to normal tissues. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) stood out as having statistically significant difference in CCT2. Higher levels of CCT2 in tumors from lung cancer patients were also associated with decreased survival. Using SCLC cell lines, we observed detectable amounts of CCT subunits and cells were susceptible to killing by CT20p. Treatment with CT20p, delivered to cells using polymeric nanoparticles, was cytotoxic to all SCLC cell lines, decreasing the levels of CCT client proteins like STAT3. In contrast, treatment with a STAT3 inhibitor was effective in one of the SCLC cell lines. While we found that CCT levels could vary in cell lines, normal tissues had low levels of CCT and minimal toxicity to liver or kidney function was observed in mice treated with CT20p. These results indicate that in SCLC, changes in CCT levels could be used as a biomarker for diagnosis and that targeting CCT for inhibition with CT20p is a promising treatment approach for those cancers such as SCLC that currently lack targeted therapeutics.""","""['Ana C Carr', 'Amr S Khaled', 'Rania Bassiouni', 'Orielyz Flores', 'Daniel Nierenberg', 'Hammad Bhatti', 'Priya Vishnubhotla', 'J Perez Manuel', 'Santimukul Santra', 'Annette R Khaled']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT/TRiC) is a novel therapeutic and diagnostic target for neuroblastoma.', 'Chaperonin Containing TCP-1 Protein Level in Breast Cancer Cells Predicts Therapeutic Application of a Cytotoxic Peptide.', 'Chaperonin-Containing TCP1 Complex (CCT) Promotes Breast Cancer Growth Through Correlations With Key Cell Cycle Regulators.', 'Function and regulation of cytosolic molecular chaperone CCT.', 'The chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1 (TCP-1).

Several germline variants have been associated with PCa-specific mortality (PCSM), but further replication evidence is needed.  Methods:   Twenty-two previously identified PCSM-associated genetic variants were genotyped in seven PCa cohorts (12,082 patients; 1544 PCa deaths). For each cohort, Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk of PCSM associated with each variant. Data were then combined using a meta-analysis approach.  Results:   Fifteen SNPs were associated with PCSM in at least one of the seven cohorts. In the meta-analysis, after adjustment for clinicopathological factors, variants in the MGMT (rs2308327; HR 0.90; p-value = 3.5 × 10-2) and IL4 (rs2070874; HR 1.22; p-value = 1.1 × 10-3) genes were confirmed to be associated with risk of PCSM. In analyses limited to men diagnosed with local or regional stage disease, a variant in AKT1, rs2494750, was also confirmed to be associated with PCSM risk (HR 0.81; p-value = 3.6 × 10-2).  Conclusions:   This meta-analysis confirms the association of three genetic variants with risk of PCSM, providing further evidence that genetic background plays a role in PCa-specific survival.

Therefore, there is a high demand for the discovery, development and improvement of novel anti-cancer agents which could efficiently prevent proliferative pathways and clonal expansion of cells.  Objective:   In view of this, a new series of bioactive scaffolds viz triazoles linked 7-hydroxycoumarin (1) were synthesized using click chemistry approach.  Method:   All the synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxicity against a panel of seven different human cancer cell lines viz. Colon (Colo-205 and HCT-116), breast (MCF-7), lung (NCI-H322 and A549), prostate (PC-3) and skin (A-431) using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-yl)-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay.  Results:   Among all tested analogs, compound 5, displayed better cytotoxic activity as compared to the parent 7- hydroxycoumarin (1) with IC50 of 5.1, 22.7, 14.3 and 10.2 µM against breast (MCF-7), lung (NCI- H322), prostate (PC-3) and skin (A-431) cancer cell lines, respectively; the compound 5 was 8-fold more sensitive against MCF-7 than the parent 7-hydroxycoumarin.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the molecular markers Ki-67, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PCa. Thirty-nine patients with 39 lesions, who had been diagnosed with PCa, were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) (b = 800 s/mm2 ). The expression of Ki-67, HIF-1α and VEGF was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Statistical analysis was applied to analyze the association between ADC and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), GS and the expression of Ki-67, HIF-1α and VEGF. The group differences in ADC among different grades of Ki-67, HIF-1α and VEGF were also analyzed. The mean ± standard deviation of ADC was (0.76 ± 0.27) × 10-3 mm2 /s. ADC correlated negatively with PSA and GS (p < 0.05).

There is a need to identify novel biomarkers for this common malignancy. SOX family genes play an important role in embryogenesis and are also implicated in various cancers. SOX11 has been recently recognized as a potential tumour suppressor that is downregulated in prostate cancer. We hypothesized that hypermethylation may be responsible for SOX11 silencing in human prostate cancer. The aim of the study was to investigate SOX11 promoter methylation in prostate adenocarcinoma by comparing it with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A total of 143 human prostate tissue samples, 62 from patients with prostate cancer and 81 from patients with BPH were examined by methylation-specific PCR. Associations between SOX11 promoter methylation and clinicopathological parameters were assessed by univariate statistics. Detection rates of SOX11 promoter methylation were 80.6% and 35.8% in prostate cancer and BPH respectively (P < 0.001). SOX11 hypermethylation was associated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics of prostate cancer, including higher PSA level (P < 0.01), Gleason score ≥ 7 (P = 0.03) and perineural invasion (P = 0.03). SOX11 methylation was positively correlated with the PSA level (P = 0.001).

Each of these areas is biologically and histologically distinct. The PZ and TZ have clinical significance and are associated with prostate cancer (PC) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), respectively. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the parenchymal and stromal components that constitute the different prostate zones.  Methods:   We assessed 19 samples from each prostate zone. The samples were obtained from necropsies of young people between 18 and 32 years of age with intact urogenital tracts. The samples were fixed in 4% buffered formalin and processed for paraffin embedding. Sections with a thickness of five micrometres were obtained from each sample. The sections were stained using histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques to identify the acinar and stromal components of each zone. Photomicrographs were obtained for morphometric analysis using an algorithm based on color segmentation. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Bonferroni post-test. Differences with P < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.  Results:   Collagen fibres were more numerous in the TZ (+40.26%; P = 0.0230) than in the PZ. Muscle fibres were also more numerous in the TZ (+47.05%; P = 0.0120) than in the PZ. Elastic system fibres in the TZ significantly differed from those in the PZ (+84.61%; P = 0.0012) and the CZ (+61.66%; P = 0.0074). Similarly, nerves in the PZ (-42.86%; P = 0.0107) significantly differed from nerves in the CZ. Epithelial height was lower in the TZ than in the PZ (-30.17%; P = 0.0034) and the CZ (-25.01%; P = 0.0330).

We have previously shown that urine/plasma-based prostate-specific biomarkers can predict high grade PCa. Our objective was to determine the accuracy of a test using cell-free RNA levels of biomarkers in predicting prostatectomy results.  Methods:   This multicenter community-based prospective study was conducted using urine/blood samples collected from 306 patients. All recruited patients were treatment-naïve, without metastases, and had been biopsied, designated a Gleason Score (GS) based on biopsy, and assigned to prostatectomy prior to participation in the study. The primary outcome measure was the urine/plasma test accuracy in predicting high grade PCa on prostatectomy compared with biopsy findings. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using standard formulas, while comparisons between groups were performed using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-Square, and Fisher's exact test.  Results:   GS as assigned by standard 10-12 core biopsies was 3 + 3 in 90 (29.4%), 3 + 4 in 122 (39.8%), 4 + 3 in 50 (16.3%), and > 4 + 3 in 44 (14.4%) patients. The urine/plasma assay confirmed a previous validation and was highly accurate in predicting the presence of high-grade PCa (Gleason ≥3 + 4) with sensitivity between 88% and 95% as verified by prostatectomy findings. GS was upgraded after prostatectomy in 27% of patients and downgraded in 12% of patients.

Mayonnaise, a primary food source of ALA intake in our cohort, was likewise only significantly associated with lethal prostate cancer in the pre-PSA era. Among many other fatty acids that are correlated with ALA due to shared food sources, none was associated with lethal prostate cancer in the pre-PSA era.

The Basic Plan to Promote Cancer Control Program published in 2006 stated that evidence-based cancer screening is required. At the conception of national cancer screening programs, there were no cancer screening assessments. From 1998 to 2001, Hisamichi formed committees for the assessment of cancer screening and published three reports. These reports were the cornerstone in assessing primary studies of cancer screening in Japan which served as a stimulus for the development of cancer screening guidelines. Since 2003, research groups funded by the National Cancer Center have developed cancer screening guidelines based on established methods in reference to international standards. Screening guidelines for the following cancers have been published: gastric, colorectal, lung, prostate, cervical and breast cancers. Recommendations for screening are made following assessment of the balance of benefits and harms. The recommendation has been divided for population-based screening and opportunistic screening. New screening techniques with insufficient evidence have been suggested to further undergo research. The national committee has continued to appraise their evidence for cancer screening based on established guidelines and has discussed implementation problems. The screening methods for breast and gastric cancers have been revised based on cancer screening guidelines. Cancer screening guidelines have increasingly contributed to the promotion of evidence-based cancer screening for national programs.

Methods:   Women aged 45 to 60 years, having 10 or more problematic HFNS a week, were recruited to a multicenter randomized controlled trial, via the occupational health/human resources departments of eight organizations. Participants were 1:1 randomized to SH-CBT or no treatment waitlist control (NTWC). The primary outcome was HFNS problem rating; secondary outcomes included HFNS frequency, work and social adjustment, sleep, mood, beliefs and behaviors, and work-related variables (absence, performance, turnover intention, and work impairment due to presenteeism). Intention-to-treat analysis was used, and between-group differences estimated using linear mixed models.  Results:   A total of 124 women were randomly allocated to SH-CBT (n = 60) and NTWC (n = 64). 104 (84%) were assessed for primary outcome at 6 weeks and 102 (82%) at 20 weeks. SH-CBT significantly reduced HFNS problem rating at 6 weeks (SH-CBT vs NTWC adjusted mean difference, -1.49; 95% CI, -2.11 to -0.86; P < 0.001) and at 20 weeks (-1.09; 95% CI, -1.87 to -0.31; P < 0.01). SH-CBT also significantly reduced HFNS frequency, improved work and social adjustment; sleep, menopause beliefs, HFNS beliefs/behaviors at 6 and 20 weeks; improved wellbeing and somatic symptoms and reduced work impairment due to menopause-related presenteeism at 20 weeks, compared with the NTWC. There was no difference between groups in other work-related outcomes.  Conclusions:   A brief, unguided SH-CBT booklet is a potentially effective management option for working women experiencing problematic HFNS.""","""['Claire Hardy', 'Amanda Griffiths', 'Sam Norton', 'Myra S Hunter']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Menopause""","""['Study protocol of a multicentre randomised controlled trial of self-help cognitive behaviour therapy for working women with menopausal symptoms (MENOS@Work).', 'Cognitive behavioural treatment for women who have menopausal symptoms after breast cancer treatment (MENOS 1): a randomised controlled trial.', 'A randomised controlled trial of a brief cognitive behavioural intervention for men who have hot flushes following prostate cancer treatment (MANCAN).', 'Cognitive behavioral therapy for menopausal symptoms.', 'Mind-body interventions for vasomotor symptoms in healthy menopausal women and breast cancer survivors.

However, supplementation trials have not indicated a benefit of selenium supplementation in reducing cancer risk. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding selenoprotein 15 (SELENOF) are associated with cancer incidence/mortality and present disproportionately in African Americans. Relationships among the genotype of selenoproteins implicated in increased cancer risk, selenium status, and race with prostate cancer were investigated.  Methods:   Tissue microarrays were used to assess SELENOF levels and cellular location in prostatic tissue. Sera and DNA from participants of the Chicago-based Adiposity Study Cohort were used to quantify selenium levels and genotype frequencies of the genes for SELENOF and the selenium-carrier protein selenoprotein P (SELENOP). Logistic regression models for dichotomous patient outcomes and regression models for continuous outcome were employed to identify both clinical, genetic, and biochemical characteristics that are associated with these outcomes.  Results:   SELENOF is dramatically reduced in prostate cancer and lower in tumors derived from African American men as compared to tumors obtained from Caucasians. Differing frequency of SELENOF polymorphisms and lower selenium levels were observed in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. SELENOF genotypes were associated with higher histological tumor grade. A polymorphism in SELENOP was associated with recurrence and higher serum PSA.

Our results suggest that women's reproductive cancers - especially breast cancer - tend to outperform men's reproductive cancer - especially prostate cancer - across campaigns and social media platforms. Twitter overall generates substantially more activity than Instagram for both cancer campaigns, suggesting Instagram may be an untapped resource. However, the messaging for both campaigns tends to focus on awareness and support rather than on concrete actions and behaviors.

A novel targeted ultrasound (US)-sensitive nanobubble that is likely to make use of the physical energy of US exposure for the improvement of delivery efficacy to target tumors and specifically silence FoxM1 expression appears as among the most potential nanocarriers in respect of drug delivery. In this study, we synthesized a promising anti-tumor targeted FoxM1 siRNA-loaded cationic nanobubbles (CNBs) conjugated with an A10-3.2 aptamer (siFoxM1-Apt-CNBs), which demonstrate high specificity when binding to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive LNCaP cells. Uniform nanoscaled siFoxM1-Apt-CNBs were developed using a thin-film hydration sonication, carbodiimide chemistry approaches, and electrostatic adsorption methods. Fluorescence imaging as well as flow cytometry evidenced the fact that the siFoxM1-Apt-CNBs were productively developed and that they specifically bound to PSMA-positive LNCaP cells. siFoxM1-Apt-CNBs combined with ultrasound-mediated nanobubble destruction (UMND) significantly improved transfection efficiency, cell apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest in vitro while reducing FoxM1 expression. In vivo xenografts tumors in nude-mouse model results showed that siFoxM1-Apt-CNBs combined with UMND led to significant inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged the survival of the mice, with low toxicity, an obvious reduction in FoxM1 expression, and a higher apoptosis index.

Material and Methods One hundred and forty-nine patients with prostate cancer filled in a questionnaire regarding their experience of the imaging procedures they had been undergoing as part of a diagnostic accuracy study. Each patient had been undergoing a NaF-PET/CT, a WB-MRI, and either a SPECT/CT (group A) or a choline-PET/CT (group B). Results All four imaging methods received overall experience ratings at the favorable end of a 5-point Likert scale with the two PET/CT scans receiving marginally better average ratings (2.0) compared to SPECT/CT (2.2) and WB-MRI (2.3). The arm positioning above the head was the most uncomfortable part of the three nuclear medicine scans, whereas the acoustic noise was the most unpleasant part of the WB-MRI. The experience of staff instruction was relatively strongly correlated to the overall scanning experience of all four imaging modalities. Overall, the patients were willing to repeat the four imaging methods and NaF-PET/CT was the method most preferred in both groups.

Methods:   A multicenter study was conducted on patients with FI that developed after multimodal therapy for pelvic tumors and was refractory to non-operative management, who were treated with SNS between November 2009 and November 2012. Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Cleveland Clinic FI score (CCFIS), FI episodes per week, FI Quality of Life (FIQoL), anorectal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency were evaluated before and after SNS.  Results:   Eleven patients (seven females, mean age 67.3 ± 4.8 years) were evaluated in the study period. Multimodal treatments included surgery and CRT (four rectal, two cervical and one prostate cancers), surgery and RT (one cervical and two endometrial cancers) and CRT (one anal cancer). The mean radiation dose was 5.3 Gy, and mean interval between the end of RT and onset of FI was 43.7 ± 23 months. Before SNS, the mean CCFIS and the mean number of FI episodes per week were 15.7 ± 2.8 and 12.3 ± 4.2, respectively. At 12-month follow-up, mean CCFIS improved to 3.6 ± 1.8 (p = 0.003) and the mean number of FI episodes decreased to 2.0 ± 1.9 per week (p = 0.003). These results persisted at 24-month follow-up.

In this study, we observed downregulation of miR-491-5p expression in PCa tissues and cell lines. CCK-8 and EdU assays showed that forced expression of miR-491-5p suppressed PCa cell proliferation, which was further confirmed in a cell cycle assay. Overexpression of miR-491-5p also reduced PCa cell migration and invasion abilities as indicated by Transwell assays. Additionally, miR-491-5p overexpression significantly inhibited PCa growth in a mouse xenograft model. Mechanistically, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) was found to be a novel target of miR-491-5p. Re-introduction of PDGFRA antagonized the inhibitory effects of miR-491-5p on the proliferation and motility abilities of PCa cells. In clinical samples of PCa, miR-491-5p was negatively correlated with PDGFRA expression, which was upregulated in PCa.

InuA directly bound to the RING domains of both MDM2 and MDMX with high affinity and specificity and disrupted MDM2-MDMX binding, markedly enhancing MDM2 protein degradation. We further discovered that InuA bound to the DNA binding domain of NFAT1, resulting in marked inhibition of MDM2 transcription. InuA inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells, regardless of their p53 status and AR responsiveness. Double knockdown of MDM2 and NFAT1 also revealed that the expression of both of these molecules is important for InuA's inhibitory effects on the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells.

We also show that HO-1 levels are significantly increased in human metastatic prostate cancer tissues and that stable HO-1 overexpression in tumor cells promotes growth and invasiveness. Co-incident with the adipocyte-induced expression of HO-1, there is an upregulation of ER chaperone BIP and splicing of XBP1, indicating adipocyte-driven unfolded protein response, a process that we show to be sensitive to antioxidant treatment. Importantly, we also demonstrate that triggering of the oxidative stress and ER stress responses, or HO-1 induction by adipocyte exposure result in the activation of pro-survival pathways, involving survivin.

Online searches reflect public awareness, which could be driven by the underlying regional cancer epidemiology.  Objective:   The objective of our study was to characterize the relationship between cancer incidence and online Google search volumes in the United States for 6 common cancers. A secondary objective was to evaluate the association of search activity with cancer-related public events and celebrity news coverage.  Methods:   We performed a population-based, retrospective study of state-level cancer incidence from 2004 through 2013 reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for breast, prostate, colon, lung, and uterine cancers and leukemia compared to Google Trends (GT) relative search volume (RSV), a metric designed by Google to allow interest in search topics to be compared between regions. Participants included persons in the United States who searched for cancer terms on Google. The primary measures were the correlation between annual state-level cancer incidence and RSV as determined by Spearman correlation and linear regression with RSV and year as independent variables and cancer incidence as the dependent variable. Temporal associations between search activity and events raising public awareness such as cancer awareness months and cancer-related celebrity news were described.  Results:   At the state level, RSV was significantly correlated to incidence for breast (r=.18, P=.001), prostate (r=-.27, P<.001), lung (r=.33, P<.001), and uterine cancers (r=.39, P<.001) and leukemia (r=.13, P=.003) but not colon cancer (r=-.02, P=.66). After adjusting for time, state-level RSV was positively correlated to cancer incidence for all cancers: breast (P<.001, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.19), prostate (P=.38, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.22), lung (P<.001, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.46), colon (P<.001, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.17), and uterine cancers (P<.001, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.12) and leukemia (P<.001, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.03). Temporal associations in GT were noted with breast cancer awareness month but not with other cancer awareness months and celebrity events.  Conclusions:   Cancer incidence is correlated with online search volume at the state level. Search patterns were temporally associated with cancer awareness months and celebrity announcements. Online searches reflect public awareness.

Minimizing the effect on an organ at risk (OAR) is important in radiotherapy. The biologically effective dose (BED) model is widely used to estimate the effect on the tumor or on the OAR, for a fixed value of dose. However, this is not always appropriate because the dose is not a single value but is distributed. The IBED and ASF models are proposed under the assumption that the irradiation is distributed. Although the IBED and ASF models are essentially equivalent for deriving the optimal irradiation scheme in the case of uniform distribution, they are not equivalent in the case of non-uniform distribution. We evaluate the differences between them for two types of cancers: high α/β ratio cancer (e.g. lung) and low α/β ratio cancer (e.g. prostate), and for various distributions i.e. various dose-volume histograms. When we adopt the IBED model, the optimal number of fractions for low α/β ratio cancers is reasonable, but for high α/β ratio cancers or for some DVHs it is extremely large. However, for the ASF model, the results keep within the range used in clinical practice for both low and high α/β ratio cancers and for most DVHs.

ARV-PBS exclusively overlapped with AR binding sites in castration-resistant (CR) tumors in patients and ARV-preferentially activated genes were up-regulated in abiraterone-resistant patient specimens. Expression of ARV-PBS target genes, such as oncogene RAP2A and cell cycle gene E2F7, were significantly associated with castration resistance, poor survival and tumor progression. We uncover distinct genomic and epigenomic features of ARV-PBS, highlighting that ARVs are useful tools to depict AR-regulated oncogenic genome and epigenome landscapes in prostate cancer. Our data also suggest that the ARV-preferentially activated transcriptional program could be targeted for effective treatment of CRPC.""","""['Yundong He', 'Ji Lu', 'Zhenqing Ye', 'Siyuan Hao', 'Liewei Wang', 'Manish Kohli', 'Donald J Tindall', 'Benyi Li', 'Runzhi Zhu', 'Liguo Wang', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Comprehensive Profiling of the Androgen Receptor in Liquid Biopsies from Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Reveals Novel Intra-AR Structural Variation and Splice Variant Expression Patterns.', 'The cistrome and gene signature of androgen receptor splice variants in castration resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Analytical Validation and Clinical Qualification of a New Immunohistochemical Assay for Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 Protein Expression in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'The interplay between non-coding RNAs and alternative splicing: from regulatory mechanism to therapeutic implications in cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Activation Induces Senescence in Thyroid Cancer Cells.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles overexpressing SFPQ protect retinal Müller cells against hypoxia-induced injury.', 'Harnessing transcriptionally driven chromosomal instability adaptation to target therapy-refractory lethal prostate cancer.']"""

The tibia is the appendicular skeleton bone affected third most often. However, tibial metastases are not well described. We conducted a retrospective descriptive single-institution study of patients with evidence of tibial metastatic disease in order to better characterize tibial metastases in their anatomical distribution and histology, and to describe their clinical presentation and surgical management. Using proprietary research software, we searched pathology and radiology reports and cross-referenced results with Current Procedural Terminology procedure codes to identify patients with metastatic lesions of the tibia. We then reviewed these patients' medical records and reviewed and verified all available imaging. We reviewed the medical records of 36 patients (20 females, 16 males) with 43 affected tibiae. Mean age was 63.5 years. Of 12 different primary neoplasms, the most common were prostate, breast, and lung cancers. The proximal tibia was the region most commonly affected, followed by the diaphysis. Of 6 impending fractures, 3 were treated with intramedullary nail, 2 with total knee megaprosthesis, and 1 with total knee arthroplasty. Of 2 pathologic fractures, 1 was treated with intramedullary nail and 1 with periarticular locking plate. Almost all identified patients (88.9%) had other metastatic lesions. Almost half (47.2%) of patients presented with symptomatic tibia lesions. Mean time from diagnosis of malignancy to tibial metastasis was 1282 days (range, 0-3708 days). Metastases to the tibia are uncommon but often require surgical intervention. Fixation technique should be selected on a case-by-case basis, and patients should be treated by a multidisciplinary team.

Methods:   19 lesions in 7 patients who had consecutive MRGBs were retrospectively analysed. Five patients had 2 consecutive MRGBs and two patients had 3 consecutive MRGBs. Both multiparametric MRI and MRGBs were performed using a 3T MRI scanner. Pathology results were categorized into benign, suspicious and malignant. Consistency between first and subsequent biopsy results were analysed as well as the negative predictive value (NPV) for prostate cancer.  Results:   15 lesions (≈79%) had matching second biopsy and 4 (21%) had non-matching second biopsy. Lesions with both Prostate Imaging - Reporting and Data System(PIRADS) categories 1 and 4 were all benign and had matching pathology results.

We evaluated the clinical detection rates of [68Ga]THP-PSMA PET/CT in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after prostatectomy.  Methods:   Consecutive patients (n=99) referred for evaluation of biochemical relapse of prostate cancer by [68Ga]THP-PSMA PET/CT were analyzed retrospectively. Patients underwent a standard whole-body PET/CT (1 h p.i.), followed by delayed (3 h p.i.) imaging of the abdomen. PSA-stratified cohorts of positive PET/CT results, standardized uptake values (SUVs) and target-to-background ratios (TBRs) were analyzed, and compared between standard and delayed imaging.  Results:   At least one lesion suggestive of recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer was identified on PET images in 52 patients (52.5%). Detection rates of [68Ga]THP-PSMA PET/CT increased with increasing PSA level: 94.1% for a PSA value of ≥10 ng/mL, 77.3% for a PSA value of 2 to <10 ng/mL, 54.5% for a PSA value of 1 to <2 ng/mL, 14.3% for a PSA value of 0.5 to <1 ng/mL, 20.0% for a PSA value of >0.2 to <0.5, and 22.2% for a PSA value of 0.01 to 0.2 ng/mL.

Our objective was to identify, through a bioinformatics analysis, Treg marker(s) expressed at the highest levels in nine types of human cancers, in order to determine the best targets for ADCC-inducing antitumor antibodies. We analyzed the mRNA levels of 24 surface Treg markers evaluated by the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array in 5728 cancer samples obtained via the Genevestigator v3 suite. Our analysis was based on overexpression of markers in tumors as compared to healthy tissues (HTs) and correlation between overexpression of the markers and the tumor suppressive microenvironment. Moreover, we evaluated tumoral infiltration of activating FcγR-expressing cells and calculated the ADCC index for each overexpressed marker, as an indicator of whether the marker was a good target for ADCC induction in tumor-infiltrating Tregs. The results demonstrated that the ADCC strategy is unlikely to succeed in colorectal, liver, prostate and ovarian cancers. Moreover, we identified nine Treg markers that could be targeted in the other tumors: 4-1BB, CD39, galectin-9, GITR, IL-21R, LAP, neuropilin-1, TIGIT and TNFR2. GITR and TIGIT were the only markers that could be potentially useful as targets for the treatment of three cancers: non-squamous and squamous NSCLC and breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of a total of 15,305 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at 2 referral centers between 1985 and 2016, and had pT2 disease at the final pathological evaluation. Descriptive statistics were used to compare baseline data stratified by pT2 substages (pT2a/b vs pT2c). Cox regression models were adjusted for institution analyzed differences in the rate of biochemical recurrence, metastasis, cancer specific death and overall mortality. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to evaluate the predictive value of pT2 subclassification for survival, including the linear predictor from the Stephenson nomogram.  Results:   Prostate specific antigen levels and Gleason score differed significantly between the pT2 substages (each p <0.0001). At a median followup of 6.0 years (IQR 3.3-10.1) 2,083 patients had biochemical recurrence, 161 had metastases, 43 had died of prostate cancer and 1,032 had died of another cause. On univariate analysis the pT2 subclassification was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (p = 0.001) and distant metastasis (p = 0.033) but not with cancer specific death (p = 0.6) or overall mortality (p = 0.3). Multivariable analysis showed no evidence of a significant association between the pT2 subclassification and biochemical recurrence (p = 0.4) or distant metastasis (p = 0.6).

Objective:   To assess the value of 2 year post treatment biopsies in a randomised trial of radiotherapy dose escalation.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between 1998 and 2001, 843 men with localised prostate cancer were randomised to receive either control-64Gy or escalated-74Gy conformal radiotherapy (CFRT) in the MRC RT01 trial in combination with 3-6-mo neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy. Prostate biopsies were planned at 2 yr from start of CFRT in suitable men.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Prostate biopsy results and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels performed at 2 yr post-CFRT were evaluated with long-term biochemical progression free survival (bPFS) and overall survival. Outcome measures were timed from the 2-yr biopsy using a landmark approach.  Results and limitations:   A 2-yr biopsy was performed in 312/843 patients. One hundred and seventy-seven patients were included in the per-protocol group with median follow-up of 7.8 yr from biopsy. Median PSA at biopsy was 0.5ng/ml. Sixty-four bPFS events were reported: 46/145 (32%) in patients with negative, 6/18 (33%) suspicious, and 12/14 (86%) positive biopsies. A positive biopsy was prognostic of worse bPFS, going forward, compared with negative and suspicious biopsies, hazard ratio (HR)=4.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.50-9.26, p<0.001). The estimate for survival was HR=1.58 (95% CI: 0.52-4.78, p=0.42). PSA values at 2 yr between 1.01ng/ml and 2.09ng/ml were also associated with subsequent PSA failures (HR=2.71, 95% CI: 1.98-3.71), bPFS events (HR=2.45, 95% CI: 1.81-3.32), and prostate cancer-specific survival (HR=2.87, 95% CI: 1.08-7.64) compared with PSA ≤1.0ng/ml.  Conclusions:   Two-year postradiotherapy prostate biopsies have limited value in patients with PSA control but both positive biopsy and higher PSA status are strongly associated with future bPFS events.

Therefore, novel treatments for PC are needed. Ether à-go-go-1 (Eag1) potassium channels display oncogenic properties, and have been suggested as early tumor markers and therapeutic targets for different cancers. These channels are overexpressed in many human tumors including PC. Astemizole targets several molecules involved in cancer including Eag1 channels, histamine receptors and ABC transporters. Here we studied Eag1 mRNA expression and protein levels in the non-tumorigenic and non-invasive human prostate RWPE-1 cell line, and in the tumorigenic and highly invasive human prostate WPE1-NB26 cell lines. The effect of astemizole on cell proliferation and apoptosis was also studied. The human prostate cell lines RWPE-1 and WPE1-NB26 were cultured following the provider´s instructions. Eag1 mRNA expression and protein levels were studied by real time RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were studied by a fluorescence AlamarBlue® assay and flow cytometry, respectively. No difference in Eag1 mRNA expression was observed between the cell lines. However, high Eag1 protein levels were observed in the invasive WPE1-NB26 cells, in contrast to the weak protein expression in RWPE-1 cells. Accordingly, astemizole decreased cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations only in the invasive WPE1-NB26 cells. Our results suggest that astemizole may have clinical relevance for prostate cancer treatment in patients with high Eag1 protein levels.""","""['Gloria Bernal-Ramos', 'Elisabeth Hernández-Gallegos', 'Eunice Vera', 'María De Guadalupe Chávez-López', 'Violeta Zúñiga-García', 'Yesennia Sánchez-Pérez', 'Efraín Garrido', 'Javier Camacho']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)""","""['Eag1 Gene and Protein Expression in Human Retinoblastoma Tumors and its Regulation by pRb in HeLa Cells.', 'Antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of astemizole on cervical cancer cells.', 'Astemizole-based anticancer therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and Eag1 channels as potential early-stage markers of HCC.', 'Astemizole: an old anti-histamine as a new promising anti-cancer drug.', 'Eag1 channels as potential cancer biomarkers.', 'The hEag1 K+ Channel Inhibitor Astemizole Stimulates Ca2+ Deposition in SaOS-2 and MG-63 Osteosarcoma Cultures.', 'The Kv10.1 Channel: A Promising Target in Cancer.', 'H1-Antihistamines Reduce the Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients With Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, or Dual Hepatitis B Virus-Hepatitis C Virus Infection.', 'Eag1 Gene and Protein Expression in Human Retinoblastoma Tumors and its Regulation by pRb in HeLa Cells.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study is nested within a cohort of men diagnosed with incidental PCa undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (the Swedish Watchful Waiting Cohort). To investigate molecular determinants of lethal PCa, men who died from PCa (n = 132) were selected as cases; controls (n = 168) comprised men with PCa who survived for at least 10 years without dying from PCa during follow-up. The immunoreactivity of iNOS in prostate tumor epithelial cells and in cells of the surrounding stroma was scored as low/negative, moderate or high. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for lethal PCa according to iNOS category.  Results:   There was no association between iNOS immunoreactivity in stroma and lethal disease. However, when comparing high versus low/negative iNOS immunoreactivity in epithelial cells, the OR for lethal PCa was 3.80 (95% CI 1.45-9.97).  Conclusion:   Patients with localized PCa have variable outcomes, especially those with moderately differentiated tumors.

Patients and methods:   In this study patients operated with monopolar TURP between 2009 and 2012 were evaluated retrospectively. During surgery a specially designed trocar (18 Fr) was placed suprapubically and connected to a suction pump to maintain stable low-pressure conditions. After sample size calculations, long-term follow-up was completed for 70 invited patients in each group up to 9/2015.  Results:   Follow-up period was 57 vs. 56 months for group 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.56). At baseline there was no significant difference in age, IPSS, peak flow, and post void residual (PVR). Mean prostate volume was 47 cc (15-65) vs. 100 cc (70-163). Mean operating time was 55.4 vs. 82.6 min (p = 0.00). Blood transfusion was necessary in 0.0 vs. 2.9% (p = 0.16), and 0.0 vs. 1.4% developed TUR syndrome (p = 0.32).

Objective:   To test this relationship, we relied on different LN count cut-offs, as well as the continuously coded number of positive LNs (NPN).  Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2014), we identified patients with D'Amico intermediate- or high-risk characteristics who underwent RP and pelvic LN dissection, regardless of pathologic LN stage. Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox regression models tested the effect of LN invasion (LNI) on CSM, according to the NPN.  Results:   Of 30016 patients treated with RP, 6.2% (n=1869) exhibited LNI, with respectively higher rates of LNI in patients with D'Amico high- versus intermediate-risk characteristics (11.6% vs 3.4%). Overall, the median age was 63yr, median prostate-specific antigen value was 6.6ng/ml and the median number of removed LNs was six. At 60 mo after RP, CSM rates were, respectively, 6.0% versus 0.8% for patients with and without LNI: multivariable hazard ratio (HR) 4.4 (p<0.001). CSM rates were, respectively, 0.8% for NPN 0, 2.4% for NPN 1-2 (HR: 3.5, p<0.001), and 7.2% for NPN ≥3 (HR: 10.3, p<0.001).  Conclusions:   The NPN is an independent predictor of higher CSM rate. Specifically, patients with one to two positive LNs are at moderately higher risk of CSM than those without LNI, and CSM risk increases sharply in those with ≥3 positive LNs. Our contemporary findings corroborate the NPN cut-offs within previous studies.

Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 3662 patients treated with RP for low-risk PCa and further stratified as very low risk (VLR) PCa-prostate-specific antigen density of ≤0.15ng/ml/cm3, ≤2 cores involved, and no core with >50% cancer involvement-at a tertiary referral hospital were identified.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Outcomes analyzed were pathological outcomes, perioperative complications, biochemical failure (BCF), and overall survival. Pathological outcomes and complications were analyzed with logistic regression models. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze survival outcomes.  Results and limitations:   In univariate/multivariate analyses, MetS was associated with upgrading and positive surgical margins in the entire cohort, upgrading only in the VLR group. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, MetS patients had a higher rate of overall death (p<0.0001) and BCF (p=0.03) for MetS patients. In the VLR group, no differences were found for BCF (p=0.064). Further, in Cox proportional hazards models, MetS was not associated with BCF (hazard ratio=1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.95-1.60, p=0.12). MetS patients had a higher rate of complications compared with non-MetS patients (23.7% vs 19.7%; p=0.01). In multivariate analysis, MetS was associated with a higher rate of complications (odds ratio=1.24, 95% CI=1.04-1.49, p=0.018) but did not impact the rate of major ones. This study is limited by its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   In low-risk PCa treated with RP but potentially eligible for AS, MetS impacted perioperative and pathological outcomes, suggesting further study of MetS in patients undergoing AS.

Methods and materials:   Patients with D'Amico low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer who underwent a single-modality treatment without androgen deprivation were included in this study. Three different treatment groups were compared: (1) normofractionation EBRT up to 70.2-79.2 Gy/1.8-2.0 Gy, (2) LDR-PB, and (3) EBRT with hypofractionation 60 Gy/3 Gy daily or 5-7.25 Gy once a week over 9-5 weeks, to a total dose of 45-36.25 Gy, respectively. The log-rank test, Cox regression analysis, and nonparametric tests were used.  Results:   We analyzed 892 patients: the median followup for patients without bF was 84 months (interquartile range 60-102 months), with 12% of patients experiencing bF. The PSA decline within the first 15 months was generally exponential. LDR-PB showed a faster early exponential decline compared with EBRT treatments, but whether decline was fast or slow had no influence on recurrence. The only factors that were positive predictive factors in univariate and multivariate analyses were the time to nadir >48 months (median), PSA nadir <0.5 ng/mL, and <0.2 ng/mL (all p < 0.001).

To explore the role of Drp1 in cancer, we examined Drp1 levels in various human cancer tissues. Tissue array analysis showed that the level of Drp1 was decreased significantly in malignant colon and lung cancer tissues, whereas no change in Drp1 was observed in breast and prostate tumors. Pairwise comparisons of cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue from colon and lung cancer patients further confirmed decreases in Drp1 expression of 75% in colon cancer patients and 78% in lung cancer patients. Moreover, Drp1 levels were decreased further with advanced grade in both colon and lung cancers, suggesting that loss of Drp1 is associated with the progression of human lung and colon cancer. Consistent with this observation, knockdown of Drp1 increased cellular migration activity in human lung cancer cells and tumor formation in a xenograft tumor model.

Multivariable, stage-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models with cluster adjustments were used to assess education and nSES main and joint effects on overall survival, before and after adjustment for social and built environment factors.  Results:   African American men had worse survival than NHW men, which was attenuated by nSES. Increased risk of death was associated with residence in lower SES neighborhoods (quintile 1 (lowest nSES) vs. 5: HR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.11-2.19) and lower education (<high school vs. college: HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.67), and a joint association of low education and low nSES was observed.

Previous studies have demonstrated that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is closely associated with the tumorigenesis and progression of PCa. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear and require further investigation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), receptor activator of nuclear factor‑κB ligand (RANKL) and runt‑related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), which are involved in cell growth and bone metastasis, are frequently activated or overexpressed in various types of cancer, including PCa. The present study was designed to investigate the associations between PGE2 and the PGE2 receptor EP4, and MMPs, RANKL and RUNX2 in PCa, and to define their roles in PCa cell proliferation and invasion in addition to understanding the molecular mechanisms. The results of western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the protein and the mRNA expression levels of MMP‑2, MMP‑9, RANKL and RUNX2 in PC‑3 cells were significantly upregulated by treatment with PGE2, respectively, and knockdown of these proteins blocked PGE2‑induced cell proliferation and invasion in PC‑3 cells, as determined by Cell Counting Kit‑8 and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. The effect of PGE2 on the protein and mRNA expression levels was primarily regulated via the EP4 receptor. EP4 receptor signaling activates the cyclic (c)AMP‑protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, and forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase (AC), exhibited similar effects to an EP4 receptor agonist on the protein expression, while SQ22536, an inhibitor of AC, inhibited the protein expression. These results confirmed that the AC/cAMP pathway may be involved in EP4 receptor‑mediated upregulation of protein expression. By using a specific inhibitor of PKA, it was also demonstrated that cAMP/PKA was also involved in the EP4 receptor‑mediated upregulation of protein expression. In addition to the signaling pathway involving PKA, the EP4 receptor also exerts activities through activation of Akt kinase. The results in the present study confirmed the hypothesis that EP4 receptor‑mediated protein expression in PCa cells that were pretreated with a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase (PI3K) was significantly inhibited. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that PGE2 significantly upregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of the MMP‑2, MMP‑9, RANKL and RUNX2, and the EP4 receptor was involved in the cell proliferation and invasion of PCa via the cAMP‑PKA/PI3K‑Akt signaling pathway.

We present a framework for threshold-driven optimization for reference-based auto-planning (TORA). Commonly used voxel-based quadratic penalties have two components for penalizing under- and over-dosing of voxels: a reference dose threshold and associated penalty weight. Conventional manual- and auto-planning using such a function involves iteratively updating the preference weights while keeping the thresholds constant, an unintuitive and often inconsistent method for planning toward some reference DVH. However, driving a dose distribution by threshold values instead of preference weights can achieve similar plans with less computational effort. The proposed methodology spatially assigns reference DVH information to threshold values, and iteratively improves the quality of that assignment. The methodology effectively handles both sub-optimal and infeasible DVHs. TORA was applied to a prostate case and a liver case as a proof-of-concept. Reference DVHs were generated using a conventional voxel-based objective, then altered to be either infeasible or easy-to-achieve. TORA was able to closely recreate reference DVHs in 5-15 iterations of solving a simple convex sub-problem. TORA has the potential to be effective for auto-planning based on reference DVHs. As dose prediction and knowledge-based planning becomes more prevalent in the clinical setting, incorporating such data into the treatment planning model in a clear, efficient way will be crucial for automated planning. A threshold-focused objective tuning should be explored over conventional methods of updating preference weights for DVH-guided treatment planning.""","""['Troy Long', 'Mingli Chen', 'Steve Jiang', 'Weiguo Lu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A DVH-guided IMRT optimization algorithm for automatic treatment planning and adaptive radiotherapy replanning.', 'Inverse optimization of objective function weights for treatment planning using clinical dose-volume histograms.', 'Quantitative comparison of automatic and manual IMRT optimization for prostate cancer: the benefits of DVH prediction.', 'Automatic treatment plan re-optimization for adaptive radiotherapy guided with the initial plan DVHs.', 'Voxel-based automatic multi-criteria optimization for intensity modulated radiation therapy.', 'Assessment of efficacy in automated plan generation for Varian Ethos intelligent optimization engine.', 'Site-agnostic 3D dose distribution prediction with deep learning neural networks.', 'Fluence Map Prediction Using Deep Learning Models - Direct Plan Generation for Pancreas Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.', 'A comparison of Monte Carlo dropout and bootstrap aggregation on the performance and uncertainty estimation in radiation therapy dose prediction with deep learning neural networks.', 'Using deep learning to predict beam-tunable Pareto optimal dose distribution for intensity-modulated radiation therapy.']"""

Nevertheless, little is known about the function and detailed molecular mechanism of miR-133b in DTX resistance of prostate cancer cells. The current study showed that miR-133b was downregulated, while human antigen R (HuR) was upregulated in prostate cancer cells. HuR was identified as a target of miR-133b, and miR-133b could suppress HuR expression. Ectopic expression of miR-133b and HuR knockdown suppressed cell viability and promoted DTX-induced apoptosis in DTX-treated prostate cancer cells, which were restored by HuR overexpression.

Kinetic study revealed that TSA-induced apoptosis was significantly dependent on enhanced transcription and protein synthesis in an early stage, which subsequently caused ER stress and apoptosis. ChIP analysis indicated that TSA increased H4K16 acetylation, promoting ER stress gene transcription. The changes in Ac-H4K16, ATF3 and ATF4 were also validated in TSA-treated animals. Further study revealed the higher enzyme activity of HDACs and an increase in acetylated proteins in resistant cells. The higher nucleocytoplasmic acetyl-CoA in resistant cells was responsible for elevated acetylation status of protein and a more vigorous growth state.

Advanced drug delivery platforms are needed to improve the biodistribution of 5-ALA. Here, we report a new approach for the delivery of 5-ALA. Squalenoylation strategy was used to covalently conjugate 5-ALA to squalene, a natural precursor of cholesterol. 5-ALA-SQ nanoassemblies were formed by self-assembly in water. The nanoassemblies were monodisperse with average size of 70 nm, polydispersity index of 0.12, and ζ-potential of + 36 mV. They showed good stability over several weeks. The drug loading of 5-ALA was very high at 26%. In human prostate cancer cells PC3 and human glioblastoma cells U87MG, PpIX production was monitored in vitro upon the incubation with nanoassemblies. They were more efficient in generating PpIX-induced fluorescence in cancer cells compared to 5-ALA-Hex at 1.0 to 3.3 mM at short and long incubation times.

Prospective studies are needed to examine the temporal relationship between oral microbiome and subsequent risk of HNSCC.  Objective:   To prospectively examine associations between the oral microbiome and incident HNSCC.  Design, setting, and participants:   This nested case-control study was carried out in 2 prospective cohort studies: the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort (CPS-II) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Among 122 004 participants, 129 incident patient cases of HNSCC were identified during an average 3.9 years of follow-up. Two controls per patient case (n = 254) were selected through incidence density sampling, matched on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and time since mouthwash collection. All participants provided mouthwash samples and were cancer-free at baseline.  Exposures:   Oral microbiome composition and specific bacterial abundances were determined through bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall oral microbiome composition and specific taxa abundances were compared for the case group and the control group, using PERMANOVA and negative binomial generalized linear models, respectively, controlling for age, sex, race, cohort, smoking, alcohol, and oral human papillomavirus-16 status. Taxa with a 2-sided false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P-value (q-value) <.10 were considered significant.  Main outcomes and measures:   Incident HNSCC.  Results:   The study included 58 patient cases from CPS-II (mean [SD] age, 71.0 [6.4] years; 16 [27.6%] women) and 71 patient cases from PLCO (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [4.8] years; 13 [18.3%] women). Two controls per patient case (n = 254) were selected through incidence density sampling, matched on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and time since mouthwash collection. Head and neck squamous cell cancer cases and controls were similar with respect to age, sex, and race. Patients in the case group were more often current tobacco smokers, tended to have greater alcohol consumption (among drinkers), and to be positive for oral carriage of papillomavirus-16. Overall microbiome composition was not associated with risk of HNSCC. Greater abundance of genera Corynebacterium (fold change [FC], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.80; q = .06) and Kingella (FC, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46-0.86; q = .08) were associated with decreased risk of HNSCC, potentially owing to carcinogen metabolism capacity. These findings were consistent for both cohorts and by cohort follow-up time. The observed relationships tended to be stronger for larynx cancer and for individuals with a history of tobacco use.  Conclusions and relevance:   This study demonstrates that greater oral abundance of commensal Corynebacterium and Kingella is associated with decreased risk of HNSCC, with potential implications for cancer prevention.""","""['Richard B Hayes', 'Jiyoung Ahn', 'Xiaozhou Fan', 'Brandilyn A Peters', 'Yingfei Ma', 'Liying Yang', 'Ilir Agalliu', 'Robert D Burk', 'Ian Ganly', 'Mark P Purdue', 'Neal D Freedman', 'Susan M Gapstur', 'Zhiheng Pei']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Oral Microbiome Profiling in Smokers with and without Head and Neck Cancer Reveals Variations Between Health and Disease.', 'Associations of Oral α-, β-, and γ-Human Papillomavirus Types With Risk of Incident Head and Neck Cancer.', '16S rRNA amplicon sequencing identifies microbiota associated with oral cancer, human papilloma virus infection and surgical treatment.', 'The epidemiology and risk factors of head and neck cancer: a focus on human papillomavirus.', 'Synchronous and metachronous head and neck carcinomas.', 'Composition of subgingival microbiota associated with periodontitis and diagnosis of malignancy-a cross-sectional study.', 'Oral-microbiome-derived signatures enable non-invasive diagnosis of laryngeal cancers.', 'A decade of progress: bibliometric analysis of trends and hotspots in oral microbiome research (2013-2022).', 'The Influence of the Oral Microbiome on Oral Cancer: A Literature Review and a New Approach.', 'Comedications with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: Involvement of the Microbiota, Impact on Efficacy and Practical Implications.']"""

Two farmed varieties were studied, var. angustifolia (FD1) and var. deltoidea (FD2). Their crude methanolic extracts were partitioned into n-hexane (FD1h, FD2h) chloroform (FD1c, FD2c) and aqueous extracts (FD1a, FD2a). Antiproliferative fractions (IC50 < 30 μg/mL, SRB staining of PC3 cells) were further fractionated. Active compound/s were dereplicated using spectroscopic methods. In vitro mechanistic studies on PC3 and/or LNCaP cells included: annexin V-FITC staining, MMP depolarization measurements, activity of caspases 3 and 7, nuclear DNA fragmentation and cell cycle analysis, modulation of Bax, Bcl-2, Smac/Diablo, and Alox-5 mRNA gene expression by RT-PCR. Effects of cytotoxic fractions on 2D migration and 3D invasion were tested by exclusion assays and modified Boyden chamber, respectively. Their mechanisms of action on these tests were further studied by measuring the expression VEGF-A, CXCR4, and CXCL12 in PC3 cells by RT-PCR. FD1c and FD2c extracts induced cell death (P < 0.05) via apoptosis as evidenced by nuclear DNA fragmentation. This was accompanied by an increase in MMP depolarization (P < 0.05), activation of caspases 3 and 7 (P < 0.05) in both PC3 and LNCaP cell lines. All active plant extracts up-regulated Bax and Smac/DIABLO, down-regulated Bcl-2 (P < 0.05). Both FD1c and FD2c were not cytotoxic against normal human fibroblast cells (HDFa) at the tested concentrations. Both plant extracts inhibited both migration and invasion of PC3 cells (P < 0.05). These effects were accompanied by down-regulation of both VEGF-A and CXCL-12 gene expressions (P < 0.001). LC-MS dereplication using taxonomy filters and molecular networking databases identified isovitexin in FD1c; and oleanolic acid, moretenol, betulin, lupenone, and lupeol in FD2c. In conclusion, FD1c and FD2c were able to overcome three main hallmarks of cancer in PC3 cells: (1) apoptosis by activating of the intrinsic pathway, (2) inhibition of both migration and invasion by modulating the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis, and (3) inhibiting angiogenesis by modulating VEGF-A expression. Moreover, isovitexin is here reported for the first time as an antiproliferative principle (IC50 = 43 μg/mL, SRB staining of PC3 cells).""","""['Mohd M M Hanafi', 'Adlin Afzan', 'Harisun Yaakob', 'Ramlan Aziz', 'Mohamad R Sarmidi', 'Jean-Luc Wolfender', 'Jose M Prieto']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['In Vitro Pro-Apoptotic and Anti-Migratory Effects of Marantodes pumilum (syn.

Methods: Forty patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were selected for treatment with three 100 kBq/kg cycles of 225Ac-PSMA-617 at 2-mo intervals. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and blood cell count were measured every 4 wk. PSMA PET/CT or PSMA SPECT/CT were used for baseline staging and imaging follow-up at month 6. Follow-up included the duration of PSA response and radiologic progression-free survival at month 6. Patient histories were reviewed for the duration of previous treatment lines, and a swimmer plot was used to intraindividually compare the duration of tumor control by PSMA therapy versus prior treatment modalities. Results: Thirty-one of 40 patients were treated per protocol. Five patients discontinued treatment because of nonresponse, and 4 because of xerostomia. Of the 38 patients surviving at least 8 wk, 24 (63%) had a PSA decline of more than 50%, and 33 (87%) had a PSA response of any degree. The median duration of tumor control under 225Ac-PSMA-617 last-line therapy was 9.0 mo; 5 patients had an enduring response of more than 2 y. Because all patients had advanced disease, this result compares favorably with the tumor control rates associated with earlier-phase disease; the most common preceding first-, second-, third-, and fourth-line therapies were abiraterone (median duration 10.0 mo), docetaxel (6.5 mo), enzalutamide (6.5 mo), and cabazitaxel (6.0 mo), respectively. Conclusion: A positive response for surrogate parameters demonstrates remarkable antitumor activity for 225Ac-PSMA-617. Swimmer-plot analysis indicates a promising duration of tumor control, especially considering the unfavorable prognostic profile of the selected advanced-stage patients. Xerostomia was the main reason patients discontinued therapy or refused additional administrations and was in the same dimension as nonresponse; this finding indicates that further modifications of the treatment regimen with regard to side effects might be necessary to further enhance the therapeutic range.""","""['Clemens Kratochwil', 'Frank Bruchertseifer', 'Hendrik Rathke', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Frederik L Giesel', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Alfred Morgenstern']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['mCRPC Patients Receiving 225Ac-PSMA-617 Therapy in the Post-Androgen Deprivation Therapy Setting: Response to Treatment and Survival Analysis.', 'Predictors of Overall and Disease-Free Survival in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving 225Ac-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy.', 'Activity and Adverse Events of Actinium-225-PSMA-617 in Advanced Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer After Failure of Lutetium-177-PSMA.', 'Hematologic toxicity profile and efficacy of 225AcAc-PSMA-617 α-radioligand therapy of patients with extensive skeletal metastases of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Response to RL-225Ac in prostate cancer: Effect of prior treatment with RL-177Lu: A systematic review of the literature.', 'PSMA-based alpha therapy in prostate cancer.', 'A GATE simulation study for dosimetry in cancer cell and micrometastasis from the 225Ac decay chain.', 'The current status of prostate cancer treatment and PSMA theranostics.', 'Diagnostic value of two-time point 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in the primary staging of untreated prostate cancer.', '225Ac-Labeled Somatostatin Analogs in the Management of Neuroendocrine Tumors: From Radiochemistry to Clinic.']"""

Methods:   In the multicentre, international, randomised, phase 3 LATITUDE trial, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had newly diagnosed, high-risk, metastatic castration-naive prostate cancer confirmed by bone scan (bone metastases) or by CT or MRI (visceral, soft tissue, or nodal metastases), and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 2 or less. Patients from 235 clinical sites in 34 countries were randomly assigned (1:1) following a country-by-country scheme done by permuted block randomisation (with two blocks) and stratified by the presence of visceral metastasis and ECOG performance status to receive ADT plus 1000 mg oral abiraterone acetate and 5 mg oral prednisone once daily or ADT plus placebos. Selection of ADT, chemical or surgical, was at the investigator's discretion. The co-primary endpoints of the trial, overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival, have been published. PRO data were collected directly on electronic tablet devices at the clinical sites during screening and before any other visit procedure on day 1 of cycles 1-3, monthly during cycles 4-13, and then every 2 months until the end of treatment, by use of the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate scale (FACT-P), and the EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires. PRO analyses were an exploratory endpoint. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. Results from the first pre-planned interim analysis (Oct 31, 2016), are presented here. This ongoing study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01715285.  Findings:   Between Feb 12, 2013, and Dec 11, 2014, 1199 patients were randomly assigned: 597 to ADT plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone and 602 to ADT plus placebos. Median follow-up was 30·9 months (IQR 21·2-33·2) in the ADT plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone group versus 29·7 months (1·4-43·5; 16·1-31·3) in the ADT plus placebos group. Median time to worst pain intensity progression assessed by the BPI-SF score was not reached in either group (ADT plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone, not reached [95% CI not reached to not reached]; 25th percentile 11·07 months [95% CI 9·23-18·43]; ADT plus placebos group, not reached [95% CI not reached to not reached]; 25th percentile 5·62 [95% CI 4·63-7·39]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·63 [95% CI 0·52-0·77]; p<0·0001). Median time to worst fatigue intensity was not reached in either the ADT plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone group (not reached [95% CI not reached to not reached]; 25th percentile 18·4 months [95% CI 12·9-27·7]) or the ADT plus placebos group (not reached [95% CI not reached to not reached]; 25th percentile 6·5 months [95% CI 5·6-9·2]; HR 0·65 [95% CI 0·53-0·81], p=0·0001). Median time to deterioration of functional status assessed by the FACT-P total score scale was 12·9 months (95% CI 9·0-16·6) in the ADT plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone group versus 8·3 months (7·4-11·1) in the ADT plus placebos group (HR 0·85 [95% CI 0·74-0·99]; p=0·032).  Interpretation:   The addition of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone to ADT in patients with newly diagnosed, high-risk metastatic castration-naive prostate cancer improved overall PROs by consistently showing a clinical benefit in the progression of pain, prostate cancer symptoms, fatigue, functional decline, and overall HRQOL.

Materials and methods:   The study included 328 patients registered as dead from prostate cancer (PCD; part I of death certificate), 126 patients with prostate cancer as other significant condition at death (OCD; part II of death certificate) and 310 patients who died with a diagnosis of prostate cancer not registered on the death certificate (PC-DCneg) in Vestfold County in 2009-2014. The complete cohort with patients' names and dates of birth was provided by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the Norwegian Cancer Registry. The true cause of death of all patients was evaluated based on patient journals.  Results:   Over-reporting of prostate cancer deaths in the PCD group was 33% while under-reporting in the OCD and PC-DCneg groups was 19% and 5%, respectively. The correlation between registered and observed causes of death was 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.83). Misattribution of prostate cancer deaths increased significantly with patient age and decreasing Gleason score.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer mortality statistics in Norway are relatively accurate for patients aged <75 years at death. However, overall accuracy of cause of death assignment is significantly reduced by misattribution among older patients (> 75 years), who represent the large majority of prostate cancer deaths. Over-reporting of prostate cancer deaths among elderly people may not be an exclusively Norwegian phenomenon and may affect prostate cancer mortality statistics in other countries.""","""['Sven Löffeler', 'Adrian Halland', 'Harald Weedon-Fekjær', 'Anastasia Nikitenko', 'Christian Lycke Ellingsen', 'Erik Skaaheim Haug']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['High prostate cancer mortality in Norway evaluated by automated classification of medical entities.', 'High prostate cancer mortality in Norway: influence of Cancer Registry information?', 'Contemporary accuracy of death certificates for coding prostate cancer as a cause of death: Is reliance on death certification good enough?

Sestrins, stress-inducible genes with antioxidant properties, have recently been implicated in several behaviors including fatigue. This proof-of-concept study explored whether the sestrin family of genes ( SESN1, SESN2, and SESN3) were differentially expressed from baseline to the midpoint of EBRT in a sample of 26 Puerto Rican men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. We also examined whether changes in expression of these genes were associated with changes in fatigue scores during EBRT.  Method:   Participants completed the 13-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue subscale, Spanish version. Whole blood samples were collected at baseline and at the midpoint of EBRT. Gene expression data were analyzed using the limma package in the R (version R 2.14.0.) statistical software. Linear models and empirical Bayes moderation, adjusted for radiation fraction (total number of days of prescribed radiation treatment), were used to examine potential associations between changes in gene expression and change in fatigue scores.  Results:   Expression of SESN3 (adjusted p < .01, log fold change -0.649) was significantly downregulated during EBRT, whereas the expressions of SESN1 and SESN2 remained unchanged. After adjustment for radiation fraction, change in SESN3 expression was associated with change in fatigue during EBRT (false discovery rate <.01).  Conclusions:   Downregulation of SESN3, a novel pharmacoactive stress response gene, was associated with fatigue intensification during EBRT. SESN3 may serve as an interventional target and a biomarker for the cellular and molecular events associated with EBRT-related fatigue.""","""['Velda J Gonzalez', 'Farnoosh Abbas-Aghababazadeh', 'Brooke L Fridley', 'Tomar Ghansah', 'Leorey N Saligan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biol Res Nurs""","""['Gene Expression, and Fatigue in Puerto Rican Men during Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: an Exploratory Study.', 'Genomic Profile of Fatigued Men Receiving Localized Radiation Therapy.', 'Lower brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels associated with worsening fatigue in prostate cancer patients during repeated stress from radiation therapy.', 'Sestrins are Gatekeepers in the Way from Stress to Aging and Disease.', 'Exploring Genetic Attributions Underlying Radiotherapy-Induced Fatigue in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Association between the antioxidant properties of SESN proteins and anti-cancer therapies.', 'Fatigue prevalence in men treated for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'FAM46C inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and promotes apoptosis through PTEN/AKT signaling pathway and is associated with chemosensitivity in prostate cancer.', 'Sestrins as a Therapeutic Bridge between ROS and Autophagy in Cancer.', 'Effect of Daily and Every Other Day Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Schedules on Treatment-Related Fatigue in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

Methods: The clinical and MRI materials of 247 patients of suspicious prostate disease treated in Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from June 2015 to November 2016 were analyzed retrospectively, including 110 cases with PCa and 137 cases without cancer.All cases underwent the high-resolution axial T(2)-weighted imaging (T(2)WI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhancement-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and were confirmed pathologically by puncture biopsies.The Mp-MRI materials of all cases were scored according to PI-RADS v2.The prostate volume and prostate specific antigen (PSA) density (PSAD) value were calculated according to the formulas.The univariate and multivariate analysis were performed for the observed indicators (age, prostate volume, PSA, PSAD and PI-RADS v2 score) to determine the independent predictors for PCa.Then, a Logistic regression model (combined prediction model) was established by the independent predictors for combined diagnosis of PCa.The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve analysis was performed to get the sensitivity and specificity of each independent predictor and the model to diagnose PCa.The differences of AUC values of each independent predictor and the model were compared with each other to evaluate the diagnostic performance for PCa. Results: The differences in the age, prostate volume, PSA, PSAD and the PI-RADS v2 score between patients with PCa and non-cancer group were all statistically significant (t=2.870, Z=-4.230, -7.787, -9.477, -10.826, all P<0.05). The PSAD and PI-RADS v2 score were independent predictors for PCa (OR=3.331, 10.546, both P<0.05). The Logistic regression combined prediction model by PI-RADS v2 score and PSAD to forecast PCa was Logit(P)=-5.097+ 2.309×PSAD+ 1.214×PI-RADS v2 score.The area under the curve (AUC) of ROC in the combined model (0.911) was higher than that in the PI-RADS v2 score (0.886) and PSAD (0.851) and the differences were all statistically significant (Z=2.416, 2.716, both P<0.05); but the difference in the AUC value between PI-RADS v2 score and PSAD was not statistically significant (Z=1.191, P=0.234). The diagnostic sensitivity of PSAD, PI-RADS v2 score and the model were: 0.891, 0.782 and 0.855, respectively; the specificity were 0.449, 0.912 and 0.847, respectively on their positive thresholds (0.15 μg·L(-1)·ml(-1,) 4 and -0.82).

Improved survival has led to an aging of PLWH. We evaluated the cancer risk in older PLWH (age ≥50 years).  Methods:   We included data from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study (1996-2012) and evaluated risks of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical, anal, lung, liver, oral cavity/pharyngeal, breast, prostate, and colon cancers in older PLWH with risk in the general population by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs). Cancer risk by time since HIV diagnosis was estimated using Poisson regression.  Results:   We identified 10371 cancers among 183542 older PLWH. Risk was significantly increased for KS (SIR, 103.34), NHL (3.05), Hodgkin lymphoma (7.61), and cervical (2.02), anal (14.00), lung (1.71), liver (2.91), and oral cavity/pharyngeal (1.66) cancers, and reduced for breast (0.61), prostate (0.47), and colon (0.63) cancers. SIRs declined with age for all cancers; however, EARs increased with age for anal, lung, liver, and oral cavity/pharyngeal cancers. Cancer risk was highest for most cancers within 5 years after HIV diagnosis; risk decreased with increasing time since HIV diagnosis for KS, NHL, lung cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma.  Conclusions:   Cancer risk is elevated among older PLWH. Although SIRs decrease with age, EARs are higher for some cancers, reflecting a greater absolute excess in cancer incidence among older PLWH. High risk in the first 5 years after HIV diagnosis for some cancers highlights the need for early HIV diagnosis and rapid treatment initiation.""","""['Parag Mahale', 'Eric A Engels', 'Anna E Coghill', 'Amy R Kahn', 'Meredith S Shiels']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Infect Dis""","""['Cancer risk in people infected with human immunodeficiency virus in the United States.', 'Cancer risk in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study: associations with immunodeficiency, smoking, and highly active antiretroviral therapy.', 'Underestimation of relative risks by standardized incidence ratios for AIDS-related cancers.', 'The epidemiology of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome malignancies.', 'Breast cancer in women living with HIV.', 'Age and Cancer Incidence in 5.2 Million People With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): The South African HIV Cancer Match Study.', 'Trends and risk of lung cancer among people living with HIV in the USA: a population-based registry linkage study.', 'Incidence and mortality of non-AIDS-defining cancers among people living with HIV: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The burden of cancer among people living with HIV in Ontario, Canada, 1997-2020: a retrospective population-based cohort study using administrative health data.', 'Revisiting the MMTV Zoonotic Hypothesis to Account for Geographic Variation in Breast Cancer Incidence.']"""

Subjects and method:   Hemoglobin-levels (Hb), the number of platelets (Plts), leukocytes (Leuk), and survival data were collected in 56 patients treated with 223Ra. Pre-therapeutic hematopoiesis as well as adverse events during and after therapy were scored (grade 0-4) according to the CTCAE recommendations. The association of pre-therapeutic hematopoiesis, survival, HT and numbers of 223Ra cycles was analyzed.  Results:   Median survival in all patients was 69.9 weeks; 77% of patients had pre-existing impaired Hb (1.7% grade 3, 12.5% grade 2, 62.5% grade 1). 8/56 (14.3%) had impaired Plt (grade 1) Maximum toxicity (Tox) grades of patients during treatment were grade 4 (Hb 1.7%; Plt 1.7%), grade 3 (Hb 14.3%; Plt 7.1%; Leu 7.1%), grade 2 (Hb 33.9%; Plt 7.1%; Leu 23.2%), grade 1 (Hb 46.4%; Plt 17.9%; Leu 23.2%) and grade 0 (Hb 5.4%; Plt 66.1%; Leu 44.6%). Interestingly, patients with thrombocytopenia had a significantly shorter survival compared to those with normal Plt levels (21 weeks vs not reached; P<0.003). As expected patients with pre-therapeutic low Hb-level (<10g/dL) had a significantly shorter survival compared to those with Hb-level >10g/dL (28 weeks vs not reached, P<0.004), whereas survival of patients with mildly impaired Hb (>10 but <13.5g/dL) did not differ from patients with normal levels of Hb (X vs. Y, P=...). Also patients with impaired Hb also developed significantly more grade 3 and 4 HT (Hb <10g/dL: 42.9 vs 14.3%, P<0.001; Plt <150G/mL: 25.0% vs 6.3%; P=0.002) and received significantly fewer treatment cycles (Hb<10g/dL: 5.1 vs 5.8, P<0.04; Plt <150G/mL: 3.4 vs 5.6; P<0.001). Neither extent of bone metastases nor previous chemotherapy were associated with survival, number of 223Ra cycles and HT.  Conclusion:   Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and impaired hematopoiesis, in particular thrombocytopenia and anemia, before 223Ra therapy suffer from significantly more high-grade HT, shorter survival and receive significantly fewer 223Ra treatments.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently underestimated lymphatic metastasis while bone scintigraphy often had diagnostic dilemmas. Prostatic specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) has been remarkable in diagnosing PC recurrence and staging. We hypothesized it can become one-stop-shop for initial risk stratification and staging.  Subjects and method:   Ninety seven PSMA PET-CT studies were re analysed for tumor node metastases (TNM) staging and risk stratification of lymphatic and distant metastases proportion. The histopathology of 23/97 patients was available as gold standard. Chi-square test was used for proportion comparison. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), over-estimation, under-estimation and correct-estimation of T and N stages were calculated. Cohen's kappa coefficient (k) was derived for inter-rater agreement.  Results:   Lymphic or distant metastases detection on PSMA PET/CT increased significantly with increase in risk category. PSMA PET/CT sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for extra prostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and lymphatic metastases were 63.16%, 100%, 100%, 36.36% & 55%, 100%, 100%, 25% and 65.62%, 99.31%, 87.50%, 97.53%, respectively. Cohen's kappa coefficient showed substantial agreement between PSMA PET/CT and histopathological lymphic metastases (κ 0.734) however, it was just in fair agreement (κ 0.277) with T stage.

Conclusion:   We found that PSMA PET/CT has potential for initial risk stratifications with reasonable correct estimation for N stage. However, it can underestimate T stage.

This retrospective case-control study investigated the relation of the intake of carotenoids and their food sources to prostate cancer risk. A sample of 652 participants (244 incident prostate cancer patients, aged 64-75 years, and 408 age frequency-matched controls) were recruited in Ho Chi Minh City during 2013-2015. The habitual diet was ascertained with a validated food-frequency questionnaire, and other factors including demographic and lifestyle characteristics were assessed via face-to-face interviews by trained nurses. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models. The risk of prostate cancer decreased with increasing intakes of lycopene, tomatoes, and carrots; the respective ORs (95% CIs) were 0.46 (0.27, 0.77), 0.39 (0.23, 0.66), and 0.35 (0.21, 0.58), when comparing the highest with the lowest tertile of intake (p for trend < 0.01).

Our aim was to examine the feasibility of three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of tumour morphology based on multiple consecutive histological sections and to decipher relevant features of prostate cancer architecture.  Methods and results:   Seventy-five consecutive histological sections (5 μm) of a typical prostate adenocarcinoma (Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7) were immunostained (pan-cytokeratin) and scanned for further 3D reconstructions with fiji/imagej software. The main findings related to the prostate cancer architecture in this case were: (i) continuity of all glands, with the tumour being an integrated system, even in Gleason pattern 4 with poorly formed glands-no short-range migration of cells by Gleason pattern 4 (poorly formed glands); (ii) no repeated interconnections between the glands, with a tumour building a tree-like branched structure with very 'plastic' branches (maximal depth of investigation 375 μm); (iii) very stark compartmentalisation of the tumour related to extensive branching, the coexistence of independent terminal units of such branches in one 2D slice explaining intratumoral heterogeneity; (iv) evidence of a craniocaudal growth direction in interglandular regions of the prostate and for a lateromedial growth direction in subcapsular posterolateral regions; and (v) a 3D architecture-based description of Gleason pattern 4 with poorly formed glands, and its continuum with Gleason pattern 3.  Conclusions:   Consecutive histological sections provide high-quality material for 3D reconstructions of the tumour architecture, with excellent resolution. The reconstruction of multiple regions in this typical case of a Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 tumour provides insights into relevant aspects of tumour growth, the continuity of Gleason patterns 3 and 4, and tumour heterogeneity.""","""['Yuri Tolkach', 'Stefan Thomann', 'Glen Kristiansen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['SOCS3 Immunohistochemical Expression Seems to Support the 2005 and 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Modified Gleason Grading System.', 'Three-dimensional microscopic image reconstruction of prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Three-dimensional analysis reveals two major architectural subgroups of prostate cancer growth patterns.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Three-dimensional imaging and analysis of pathological tissue samples with de novo generation of citrate-based fluorophores.', '3D imaging for driving cancer discovery.', 'Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification via Nondestructive 3D Pathology with Deep Learning-Assisted Gland Analysis.', 'Robotic ureteral reimplantation for the management of ureterovaginal fistula: four cases at a single center.', 'Tutorial: methods for three-dimensional visualization of archival tissue material.']"""

Subjects and methods:   A prospective study included 58 patients with untreated high-risk prostate cancer. After conventional staging (CT and bone scintigraphy), patients underwent FCH PET/WBMRI (n = 10) or FCH PET/CT and WBMRI (n = 48). Metastatic sites and disease stage were recorded for each modality (conventional imaging, PET, WBMRI, and PET/WBMRI) and compared with a standard of reference (histopathologic examination, imaging, and clinical follow-up) and early clinical outcomes.  Results:   In the detection of metastases, PET had significantly higher sensitivity (72/77 [93.5%]) than conventional imaging (49/77 [63.6%]; p < 0.001) and WBMRI (56/77 [72.7%]; p = 0.002). There was a trend toward improved detection with PET/WBMRI (77/77 [100%]) compared with PET alone (p = 0.059). For correct NM staging, PET and PET/WBMRI performed better than conventional imaging (p = 0.002) and WBMRI (p = 0.008). Twelve of 56 patients (21.4%) had early biochemical failure after radical treatment (median, 7 months; range, 1-20 months). This rate was higher for patients with M1a or M1b disease at PET/WBMRI than for others, but this finding did not reach statistical significance (4/8 [50%] vs 8/48 [16.7%]; p = 0.055).

Volumetric arc radiotherapy (VMAT) can decrease the treatment machine monitor units (MUs). Previous studies have shown that VMAT with multileaf collimator (MLC) rotation exhibits better target dose distribution. Thus, VMAT with MLC rotation warrants further investigation.  Methods and materials:   Ten patients with prostate cancer were included in this study. The prostate gland and seminal vesicle received 68.75 and 55 Gy, respectively, in 25 fractions. A dual-arc VMAT plan with a collimator angle of 0° was generated and the same constraints were used to reoptimize VMAT plans with different collimator angles. The conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), gradient index (GI), normalized dose contrast (NDC), MU, and modulation complexity score (MCSV ) of the target were analyzed. The dose-volume histogram of the adjacent organs was analyzed. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare different collimator angles.  Results:   Optimum values of CI, HI, and MCSV were obtained with a collimator angle of 45°. The optimum values of GI, and NDC were observed with a collimator angle of 0°. In the rectum, the highest values of maximum dose and volume receiving 60 Gy (V60 Gy ) were obtained with a collimator angle of 0°, and the lowest value of mean dose (Dmean ) was obtained with a collimator angle of 45°. In the bladder, high values of Dmean were obtained with collimator angles of 75° and 90°. In the rectum and bladder, the values of V60 Gy obtained with the other tested angles were not significantly higher than those obtained with an angle of 0°.  Conclusion:   This study found that MLC rotation affects VMAT plan complexity and dosimetric distribution. A collimator angle of 45° exhibited the optimal values of CI, HI, and MCSv among all the tested collimator angles. Late side effects of the rectum and bladder are associated with high-dose volumes by previous studies. MLC rotation did not have statistically significantly higher values of V60 Gy in the rectum and bladder than did the 0° angle. We thought a collimator angle of 45° was an optimal angle for the prostate VMAT treatment plan. The findings can serve as a guide for collimator angle selection in prostate hypofractionated VMAT planning.""","""['Ming-Hsien Li', 'Sheng-Fang Huang', 'Chih-Chieh Chang', 'Jang-Chun Lin', 'Jo-Ting Tsai']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['VMAT optimization with dynamic collimator rotation.', 'A dosimetric comparison of tomotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy in the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer with pelvic nodal radiation therapy.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT): a review of clinical outcomes-what is the clinical evidence for the most effective implementation?', 'Evolution of hypofractionated accelerated radiotherapy for prostate cancer - the sunnybrook experience.', 'Dosimetric evaluation study of IMRT and VMAT techniques for prostate cancer based on different multileaf collimator designs.', 'Dosimetric feasibility of moderately hypofractionated/dose escalated radiation therapy for localised prostate cancer with intensity-modulated proton beam therapy using simultaneous integrated boost (SIB-IMPT) and impact of hydrogel prostate-rectum spacer.', 'Optimization of collimator angles in dual-arc volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for whole-brain radiotherapy with hippocampus and inner ear sparing.', 'Optimal tumor coverage with different beam energies by IMRT, VMAT and TOMO: Effects on patients with proximal gastric cancer.', 'A Collimator Setting Optimization Algorithm for Dual-Arc Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy in Pancreas Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.']"""

We selected 8,471 Swedish men with newly diagnosed PCa who had exposure measurements taken approximately 14 years prior to diagnosis. We calculated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the associations between the inflammatory markers and PCa severity using logistic regression, while Cox proportional hazard regression was used for the associations with overall and PCa death.

As a result, the need for more appropriate cellular models of human physiology and disease has renewed the interest in spheroid 3D culture as a pertinent model for drug screening. However, despite technological progress that has significantly simplified spheroid production and analysis, the seeming complexity of the 3D approach has delayed its adoption in many laboratories. The present report demonstrates that the use of a spheroid model may be straightforward and can provide information that is not directly available with a standard 2D approach. We describe a cost-efficient method that allows for the production of an array of uniform spheroids, their staining with vital dyes, real-time monitoring of drug effects, and an ATP-endpoint assay, all in the same 96-well U-bottom plate. To demonstrate the method performance, we analyzed the effect of the preclinical anticancer drug MLN4924 on spheroids formed by VCaP and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The drug has different outcomes in these cell lines, varying from cell cycle arrest and protective dormancy to senescence and apoptosis. We demonstrate that by using high-content analysis of spheroid arrays, the effect of the drug can be described as a series of EC50 values that clearly dissect the cytostatic and cytotoxic drug actions. The method was further evaluated using four standard cancer chemotherapeutics with different mechanisms of action, and the effect of each drug is described as a unique multi-EC50 diagram. Once fully validated in a wider range of conditions, this method could be particularly valuable for phenotype-based drug discovery.""","""['Frédérique Mittler', 'Patricia Obeïd', 'Anastasia V Rulina', 'Vincent Haguet', 'Xavier Gidrol', 'Maxim Y Balakirev']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Real-time viability and apoptosis kinetic detection method of 3D multicellular tumor spheroids using the Celigo Image Cytometer.', 'High-content assays for characterizing the viability and morphology of 3D cancer spheroid cultures.', 'Fully Automated One-Step Production of Functional 3D Tumor Spheroids for High-Content Screening.', 'The production of 3D tumor spheroids for cancer drug discovery.', 'The multicellular tumor spheroid model for high-throughput cancer drug discovery.', 'The Antiproliferative Effect of Chloroform Fraction of Eleutherine bulbosa (Mill.)

As a result, there has been a surge in the development of platforms that enable three dimensional (3D) cultures thought to better replicate natural physiology and better predict drug efficacy. A deficiency associated with most 3D culture systems is that their complexity reduces the number of replicates and combination therapies that can be feasibly evaluated. Herein, we describe the use of a microwell platform that utilises a nylon mesh to retain 3D micro-tumours in discrete microwells; termed the Microwell-mesh. The Microwell-mesh enables the manufacture of ~150 micro-tumours per well in a 48-well plate, and response to anti-tumour drugs can be readily quantified. Our results demonstrate that 3D micro-tumours, unlike 2D monolayers, are not hypersensitive to Docetaxel or Abiraterone Acetate, providing a superior platform for the evaluation of sequential drug treatment. In summary, the Microwell-mesh provides an efficient 3D micro-tumour platform for single and sequential drug screening.""","""['E O Mosaad', 'K F Chambers', 'K Futrega', 'J A Clements', 'M R Doran']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Using high throughput microtissue culture to study the difference in prostate cancer cell behavior and drug response in 2D and 3D co-cultures.', '3D Cultures of prostate cancer cells cultured in a novel high-throughput culture platform are more resistant to chemotherapeutics compared to cells cultured in monolayer.', 'The microwell-mesh: A novel device and protocol for the high throughput manufacturing of cartilage microtissues.', 'Three-Dimensional Cell Cultures as an In Vitro Tool for Prostate Cancer Modeling and Drug Discovery.', 'Biological behavior of prostate cancer cells in 3D culture systems.', 'Method for manufacture and cryopreservation of cartilage microtissues.', 'Cancer Spheroids and Organoids as Novel Tools for Research and Therapy: State of the Art and Challenges to Guide Precision Medicine.', 'Automated high-throughput image processing as part of the screening platform for personalized oncology.', 'Tissue-Engineered 3D In Vitro Disease Models for High-Throughput Drug Screening.', 'Cell-Taxi: Mesenchymal Cells Carry and Transport Clusters of Cancer Cells.']"""

Design:   Analysis of genotype, PCa status, and age to select single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with diagnosis. These polymorphisms were incorporated into a survival analysis to estimate their effects on age at diagnosis of aggressive PCa (that is, not eligible for surveillance according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines; any of Gleason score ≥7, stage T3-T4, PSA (prostate specific antigen) concentration ≥10 ng/L, nodal metastasis, distant metastasis). The resulting polygenic hazard score is an assessment of individual genetic risk. The final model was applied to an independent dataset containing genotype and PSA screening data. The hazard score was calculated for these men to test prediction of survival free from PCa.  Setting:   Multiple institutions that were members of international PRACTICAL consortium.  Participants:   All consortium participants of European ancestry with known age, PCa status, and quality assured custom (iCOGS) array genotype data. The development dataset comprised 31 747 men; the validation dataset comprised 6411 men.  Main outcome measures:   Prediction with hazard score of age of onset of aggressive cancer in validation set.  Results:   In the independent validation set, the hazard score calculated from 54 single nucleotide polymorphisms was a highly significant predictor of age at diagnosis of aggressive cancer (z=11.2, P<10-16). When men in the validation set with high scores (>98th centile) were compared with those with average scores (30th-70th centile), the hazard ratio for aggressive cancer was 2.9 (95% confidence interval 2.4 to 3.4). Inclusion of family history in a combined model did not improve prediction of onset of aggressive PCa (P=0.59), and polygenic hazard score performance remained high when family history was accounted for. Additionally, the positive predictive value of PSA screening for aggressive PCa was increased with increasing polygenic hazard score.  Conclusions:   Polygenic hazard scores can be used for personalised genetic risk estimates that can predict for age at onset of aggressive PCa.""","""['Tyler M Seibert', 'Chun Chieh Fan', 'Yunpeng Wang', 'Verena Zuber', 'Roshan Karunamuni', 'J Kellogg Parsons', 'Rosalind A Eeles', 'Douglas F Easton', 'ZSofia Kote-Jarai', 'Ali Amin Al Olama', 'Sara Benlloch Garcia', 'Kenneth Muir', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Markus Aly', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'Csilla Sipeky', 'Teuvo Lj Tammela', 'Børge G Nordestgaard', 'Sune F Nielsen', 'Maren Weischer', 'Rasmus Bisbjerg', 'M Andreas Røder', 'Peter Iversen', 'Tim J Key', 'Ruth C Travis', 'David E Neal', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Paul Pharoah', 'Nora Pashayan', 'Kay-Tee Khaw', 'Christiane Maier', 'Walther Vogel', 'Manuel Luedeke', 'Kathleen Herkommer', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Cezary Cybulski', 'Dominika Wokolorczyk', 'Wojciech Kluzniak', 'Lisa Cannon-Albright', 'Hermann Brenner', 'Katarina Cuk', 'Kai-Uwe Saum', 'Jong Y Park', 'Thomas A Sellers', 'Chavdar Slavov', 'Radka Kaneva', 'Vanio Mitev', 'Jyotsna Batra', 'Judith A Clements', 'Amanda Spurdle', 'Manuel R Teixeira', 'Paula Paulo', 'Sofia Maia', 'Hardev Pandha', 'Agnieszka Michael', 'Andrzej Kierzek', 'David S Karow', 'Ian G Mills', 'Ole A Andreassen', 'Anders M Dale;PRACTICAL Consortium*']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMJ""","""['Development and validation of a polygenic hazard score for aggressive prostate cancer identification.', 'A ""PSA pyramid"" for men with initial prostate-specific antigen ≤3 ng/ml: a plea for individualized prostate cancer screening.', 'A genetic score can identify men at high risk for prostate cancer among men with prostate-specific antigen of 1-3 ng/ml.', 'Prostate cancer screening in men aged 50-69 years (STHLM3): a prospective population-based diagnostic study.', 'Early detection of prostate cancer: European Association of Urology recommendation.', 'Polygenic Risk Scores in Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment and Screening.', 'Dose outside of the prostate is associated with improved outcomes for high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with brachytherapy boost.', 'Polygenic risk affects the penetrance of monogenic kidney disease.', 'Evaluation of polygenic risk score for risk prediction of gastric cancer.', 'The Combined Effect of Polygenic Risk Score and Prostate Health Index in Chinese Men Undergoing Prostate Biopsy.', 'Polygenic risk score for tumor aggressiveness and early-onset prostate cancer in Asians.']"""

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may serve as important regulators in PCa occurrence and development. Therefore, understanding the expression and functions of PCa-related miRNAs may be beneficial for the identification of novel therapeutic methods for patients with PCa. In this study, miRNA-212 (miR-212) was evidently downregulated in PCa tissues and several PCa cell lines. Functional assays showed that the resumption of miR-212 expression attenuated cell proliferation and invasion and increased the apoptosis of PCa. In addition, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), a well-known oncogene, was identified as a novel target of miR-212 in PCa, as confirmed by bioinformatics, luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, MAPK1 expression was upregulated in PCa tissues and inversely correlated with miR-212 expression. Rescue experiments also demonstrated that restored MAPK1 expression reversed the tumor-suppressing effects of miR-212 on PCa cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis. In conclusion, miR-212 may exert tumor-suppressing roles in PCa by regulating MAPK1 and could be a novel therapeutic target for treatment of patients with this malignancy.""","""['Bo Hu', 'Xunbo Jin', 'Jianbo Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Res""","""['miR-199b-5p-DDR1-ERK signalling axis suppresses prostate cancer metastasis via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'MicroRNA-140 inhibit prostate cancer cell invasion and migration by targeting YES proto-oncogene 1.', 'Tumor-Suppressive Function of miR-30d-5p in Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration by Targeting NT5E.', 'MicroRNAs in Prostate Cancer Following Radiotherapy: Towards Predicting Response to Radiation Treatment.', 'Prostate cancer and microRNAs: New insights into apoptosis.', 'The Complex Role of HBeAg and Its Precursors in the Pathway to Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Anti-colorectal cancer of Ardisia gigantifolia Stapf. and targets prediction via network pharmacology and molecular docking study.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Crucial Roles of microRNA-Mediated Autophagy in Urologic Malignancies.', 'Negative feedback loop of ERK/CREB/miR-212-3p inhibits HBeAg-induced macrophage activation.']"""

Few dietary or lifestyle interventions have been tested to prevent prostate cancer progression. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation represents a promising intervention for prostate cancer patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn3), more precisely eicosapentaenoic acid monoacylglyceride (MAG-EPA) supplementation, on prostate cancer proliferation, inflammation mediators and quality of life among men who will undergo radical prostatectomy.  Methods/design:   We propose a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of MAG-EPA supplementation for 130 men who will undergo radical prostatectomy as treatment for a prostate cancer of Gleason score ≥ 7 in an academic cancer center in Quebec City. Participants will be randomized to 6 capsules of 625 mg of fish oil (MAG-EPA) per capsule containing 500 mg of EPA daily or to identically looking capsules of high oleic acid sunflower oil (HOSO) as placebo. The intervention begins 4 to 10 weeks prior to radical prostatectomy (baseline) and continues for one year after surgery. The primary endpoint is the proliferative index (Ki-67) measured in prostate cancer cells at radical prostatectomy. A secondary endpoint includes prostate tissue levels of inflammatory mediators (cytokines and proteins) at time of radical prostatectomy. Changes in blood levels of inflammatory mediators, relative to baseline levels, at time of radical prostatectomy and 12 months after radical prostatectomy will also be evaluated. Secondary endpoints also include important aspects of psychosocial functioning and quality of life such as depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive complaints and prostate cancer-specific quality of life domains. The changes in these outcomes, relative to baseline levels, will be evaluated at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after radical prostatectomy.  Discussion:   The results from this trial will provide crucial information to clarify the role of omega-3 supplementation on prostate cancer proliferation, inflammation and quality of life.

It has many advantages over the conventional photon based radiotherapy using Co-60 gamma or high energy X-rays from a Linear Accelerator. However, charged particle therapy is very costly. One way to reduce the cost as well as irradiation effects on normal cells is to reduce the dose of radiation by enhancing the radiation sensitivity through the use of a radiomodulator. PNKP (polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase) is an enzyme which plays important role in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathway. It is expected that inhibition of PNKP activity may enhance the efficacy of the charged particle irradiation in the radioresistant prostate cancer cell line PC-3. To test this hypothesis, we investigated cellular radiosensitivity by clonogenic cell survival assay in PC-3 cells.12Carbon ion beam of62 MeVenergy (equivalent 5.16 MeV/nucleon) and with an entrance LET of 287 kev/μm was used for the present study. Apoptotic parameters such as nuclear fragmentation and caspase-3 activity were measured by DAPI staining, nuclear ladder assay and colorimetric caspase-3method. Cell cycle arrest was determined by FACS analysis. Cell death was enhanced when carbon ion irradiation is combined with PNKPi (PNKP inhibitor) to treat cells as compared to that seen for PNKPi untreated cells. A low concentration (10μM) of PNKPi effectively radiosensitized the PC-3 cells in terms of reduction of dose in achieving the same survival fraction. PC-3 cells underwent significant apoptosis and cell cycle arrest too was enhanced at G2/M phase when carbon ion irradiation was combined with PNKPi treatment. Our findings suggest that combined treatment of carbon ion irradiation and PNKP inhibition could enhance cellular radiosensitivity in a radioresistant prostate cancer cell line PC-3. The synergistic effect of PNKPi and carbon ion irradiation could be used as a promising method for carbon-ion therapy in radioresistant cells.""","""['Pallavi Srivastava', 'Asitikantha Sarma', 'Chandra Mohini Chaturvedi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Does particle radiation have superior radiobiological advantages for prostate cancer cells?

Methods:   The medical records of 170 patients with high-risk prostate cancer who received SRT for biochemical recurrence following prostatectomy were reviewed. Whole-pelvic IMRT was administered with a median dose of 66 Gy in 30 fractions. To improve treatment accuracy, an endorectal balloon device and daily cone-beam computed tomography were utilized.

Regarding BCP-free survival analysis, pathological T stage, persistent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevation after prostatectomy, and preSRT PSA level were significant prognostic factors on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, pathological T stage and preSRT PSA value retained their significance.

Univariable and multivariable logistic and competing risk regression models evaluated docetaxel-dose association with FN and early treatment cessation (ETC) due to toxicity. Associations between dose and efficacy end points were also evaluated. Analyses were repeated employing inverse propensity score weights.  Results:   Patients who received LD docetaxel (28.9%) were older with poorer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status. Fifteen percent of patients experienced FN, with a nonsignificant trend to lower incidence in the LD group (multiple adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.42; P = 0.21). Neither baseline patient nor prior treatment factors were predictive of FN. ETC due to toxicity occurred in 35%, with risk associated with increasing age, comorbidity count and poorer ECOG. There was no difference between LD and SD with respect to ETC due to toxicity, in unweighted and weighted analyses (LD vs SD, multivariable weighted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.47; P = 0.08). LD was associated with reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (50% vs 66.1%, multivariable weighted HR = 0.54; P = 0.03) and overall survival (median 7.9 vs 13.8 months, multivariable weighted HR = 2.19; P < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   LD docetaxel for mCRPC did not mitigate the risk of FN or ETC due to toxicity. Dose reduction may result in poorer PSA response and survival.""","""['Anis A Hamid', 'Kaspar Willson', 'Andrew D Vincent', 'Babak Tamjid', 'Margaret Lee', 'Alice Bergin', 'Chun Gan', 'Ainsley Campbell', 'Josephine Stewart', 'Carmel Pezaro', 'Ben Tran', 'Andrew J Weickhardt']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asia Pac J Clin Oncol""","""['Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia and Outcome in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated With First-Line Docetaxel.', 'Does castration status affect docetaxel-related adverse events? :Identification of risk factors for docetaxel-related adverse events in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Prevention of docetaxel-associated febrile neutropenia with primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in Chinese metastatic hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Taxanes in the management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: efficacy and management of toxicity.', 'Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Docetaxel Treatment of Prostate Cancer: From Discovery to Implementation.']"""

Besides their high anti-proliferative activity, some severe long-term side effects have been observed, for example genotoxicity and mutagenicity, likely strictly related to the formation of crosslinks. It has been demonstrated that blue light (BL) activation of 8-methoxypsoralen, an FDA-approved drug, leads to less mutagenic monoadducts in the DNA. So far, in this work the less toxic and more penetrating BL is proposed to activate 4,6,4'-trimethylangelicin (TMA), an already known UVA photoactivatable compound.  Materials and methods:   Photocleavage, crosslink formation and oxidative damage were detected in pBR322 plasmid DNA treated with 300.0 μmol/L TMA activated with various exposures of BL. Anti-proliferative activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and activation status of some signalling pathways involved in cell growth and apoptosis were verified on DU145 cells treated with 5.0 μmol/L TMA plus 2.0 J/cm2 of BL.  Results:   Under BL-TMA, no mutagenic crosslinks, no photocleavage and neither photooxidative lesions were detected on isolated plasmid DNA. TMA showed high anti-proliferative activity on DU145 cells through induction of apoptosis. Besides ROS generation, the proapoptotic effect seemed to be related to activation of p38 and inhibition of p44/42 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the decrease in nuclear β-catenin was coupled with a significant dropping of CD44-positive cells.  Conclusion:   Overall, our results indicate that TMA can be activated by BL and may be considered for targeted phototherapy of prostate cancer lesions.""","""['G Miolo', 'G Sturaro', 'G Cigolini', 'L Menilli', 'A Tasso', 'I Zago', 'M T Conconi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Prolif""","""[""4,6,4'-Trimethylangelicin Photoactivated by Blue Light Might Represent an Interesting Option for Photochemotherapy of Non-Invasive Bladder Carcinoma: An In Vitro Study on T24 Cells."", 'Antiproliferative activity of 8-methoxypsoralen on DU145 prostate cancer cells under UVA and blue light.', 'Induction of gamma-globin mRNA, erythroid differentiation and apoptosis in UVA-irradiated human erythroid cells in the presence of furocumarin derivatives.', 'Activation of the human immunodeficiency virus promoter by UVA radiation in combination with psoralens or angelicins.', 'Differentiation and apoptosis in UVA-irradiated cells treated with furocoumarin derivatives.', 'Preclinical and Clinical Research Models of Prostate Cancer: A Brief Overview.', ""4,6,4'-Trimethylangelicin Photoactivated by Blue Light Might Represent an Interesting Option for Photochemotherapy of Non-Invasive Bladder Carcinoma: An In Vitro Study on T24 Cells.""]"""

Overexpression of a TTSP hepsin characterizes many solid cancers, including prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer, and in experimental tumor models, the elevated proteolytic activity of hepsin simultaneously activates several growth factors and cleaves basement membrane protein laminin-332, which is an essential component of the cell-basement membrane junction hemidesmosome. These hepsin-dependent molecular events associate with dramatic loss of basement membrane integrity in mouse tumor models and in three-dimensional (3D) epithelial culture. In particular, the 3D culture systems offer unprecedented possibilities to clarify the mechanistic basis of destructive interactions between out-of-control serine protease activity and the basement membrane structure. Here, we describe how to establish 3D mammary epithelial culture in an exogenous basement membrane-free egg white matrix and provide a protocol for quantitative analysis of the impact of hepsin on laminin-332 and its hemidesmosomal receptor α6-integrin by means of confocal microscopy imaging.

Direct targeting of AR has valuable therapeutic potential. However, the lack of disease relevant cellular methodologies capable of discriminating between inhibitors that directly bind AR and those that instead act on AR co-regulators has made identification of novel antagonists challenging. The Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) is a technology enabling confirmation of direct target engagement with label-free, endogenous protein in living cells. We report the development of the first high-throughput CETSA assay (CETSA HT) to identify direct AR binders in a prostate cancer cell line endogenously expressing AR. Using this approach, we screened a pharmacology library containing both compounds reported to directly engage AR, and compounds expected to target AR co-regulators. Our results show that CETSA HT exclusively identifies direct AR binders, differentiating them from co-regulator inhibitors where other cellular assays measuring functional responses cannot. Using this CETSA HT approach we can derive apparent binding affinities for a range of AR antagonists, which represent an intracellular measure of antagonist-receptor Ki performed for the first time in a label-free, disease-relevant context.

Methods:   A total of 19 patients with biochemical recurrence after LDR brachytherapy underwent 3T endorectal coil mpMRI with T2-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with pathologic confirmation. Prospective reads by an experienced prostate radiologist were compared with reads from 4 radiologists of varying experience. Readers identified suspicious lesions and rated each MRI detection parameter. MRI-detected lesions were considered true-positive with ipsilateral pathologic confirmation. Inferences for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), kappa, and index of specific agreement were made with the use of bootstrap resampling.  Results:   Pathologically confirmed recurrence was found in 15 of 19 patients. True positive recurrences identified by mpMRI were frequently located in the transition zone (46.7%) and seminal vesicles (30%). On patient-based analysis, average sensitivity of mpMRI was 88% (standard error [SE], 3.5%). For highly suspicious lesions, specificity of mpMRI was 75% (SE, 16.5%). On lesion-based analysis, the average PPV was 62% (SE, 6.7%) for all lesions and 78.7% (SE, 10.3%) for highly suspicious lesions. The average PPV for lesions invading the seminal vesicles was 88.8% (n=13). The average PPV was 66.6% (SE, 5.8%) for lesions identified with T2-weighted imaging, 64.9% (SE, 7.3%) for DCE, and 70% (SE, 7.3%) for DWI.

These tests are not specific for primary hyperfibrinolysis. We reported a rare case of hemorrhagic syndrome caused by primary hyperfibrinolysis as the first clinical symptom of metastatic prostate cancer.  Case report:   A 64-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with large hematomas in the right pectoral and axillary areas (20 x 7 cm), right hemiabdomen (30 x 30 cm) and the left lumbal area, (25 x 5 cm). The patient had no subjective symptoms nor used any medication. Initial coagulation testing, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were within the normal range, while fibrinogen level was extremely low (1.068 g/L) (normal range 2.0–5.0) and the D-dimer assay result was high 1.122 mg/L (normal range < 0.23). The results obtained by rotation thrombelastometry pointed to primary fibrinolysis. Further clinical and laboratory examination indicated progressive malignant prostate disease. First line treatment for the patient was a combined administration of tranexamic acid (3 x 500 mg iv) and transfusion of ten units of cryoprecipitate (400 mL). Next day, fibrinolytic function measurements by rotation thrombelastometry were within the normal ranges. Fibrinogen level was normalized within two days (2.4 g/L).

Dovitinib is an oral, pan-class inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of dovitinib in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Materials and methods:   This study was a single-arm, phase II, open-label, multicenter trial of dovitinib 500 mg/day (5-days-on/2-days-off schedule). The primary endpointwas 16-week progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), toxicity and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate. Biomarker analyses for VEGFR2, FGF23, and FGFR2 using multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed.  Results:   Forty-four men were accrued from 11 hospitals. Eighty percent were post-docetaxel. Median PSA was 100 ng/dL, median age was 69, 82% had bone metastases, and 23% had liver metastases. Median cycles of dovitinibwas 2 (range, 0 to 33). Median PFSwas 3.67 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36 to 5.98) and median OS was 13.70 months (95% CI, 0 to 27.41). Chemotherapy-naïve patients had longer PFS (17.90 months; 95% CI, 9.23 to 28.57) compared with docetaxel-treated patients (2.07 months; 95% CI, 1.73 to 2.41; p=0.001) and the patients with high serum VEGFR2 level over median level (7,800 pg/mL) showed longer PFS compared with others (6.03 months [95% CI, 4.26 to 7.80] vs. 1.97 months [95% CI, 1.79 to 2.15], p=0.023). Grade 3 related adverse events were seen in 40.9% of patients. Grade 1-2 nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, anorexia, and all grade thrombocytopenia are common.

Materials and methods:   Data were obtained from the Korean National Cancer Incidence Database. We calculated the age-standardized cumulative cancerincidences according to sex and geographicalregion (metropolitan cities, provinces, and districts) for three 5-year periods (1999-2003, 2004- 2008, and 2009-2013).

Results:   Substantial differences in cancer incidences were observed according to district and cancer type. The largest variations between geographical regions were found for thyroid cancer among both men and women. There was little variation in the incidences of stomach, colorectal, and lung cancer according to geographical region. Substantially elevated incidences of specific cancers were observed in Jeollanam-do (thyroid); Daejeon (colorectum); Jeollanam-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Chungcheongbuk-do (lung); Seocho-gu, Gangnam-gu and Seongnam, Bundang-gu (breast and prostate); Chungcheong and Gyeongsang provinces (stomach); Ulleung-gun and the southern districts of Gyeongsangnam-do and Jeollanam-do (liver); and along the Nakdonggang River (gallbladder and biliary tract).

To support patient needs and increase efficiency of care with limited resources, the Swedish government has launched national reforms to redesign cancer care pathways.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to explore how prostate cancer patients experience their journey through the healthcare system when their care is provided according to the standardized care pathway, as described in healthcare policy documents.  Methods:   A qualitative, descriptive approach with individual interviews was used. A template of a standardized prostate cancer pathway, created together with healthcare professionals, was used during interviews. Fourteen interviews were conducted with prostate cancer patients all operated on at a midsized hospital in southeast Sweden between October 2015 and April 2016. The interviews were analyzed with qualitative content analysis and illustrated in a patient journey map.  Results:   We identified an overall theme, ""walking a tightrope,"" consisting of 4 categories: ""waiting,"" ""becoming familiar with a troublesome body,"" ""adjusting to a different life,"" and ""information challenges.""  Conclusions:   The clinical implementation of the standardized care pathway is described as a straight path through care, but patients described their experiences as walking a tightrope. Lack of information, especially about cancer treatment and its adverse effects, was the most common experience.  Implications for practice:   Our findings indicate areas where further healthcare tools could improve patient experiences of cancer treatment. This could include offering individualized information and tools to increase patient empowerment, as well as patient/caregiver collaboration (co-care).""","""['Kristina Schildmeijer', 'Oscar Frykholm', 'Åsa Kneck', 'Mirjam Ekstedt']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""['""It\'s not just about prostate cancer, it\'s about being a gay man"": A qualitative study of gay men\'s experiences of healthcare provision in the UK.', 'The patient experience of patient-centered communication with nurses in the hospital setting: a qualitative systematic review protocol.', 'Building COPD care on shaky ground: a mixed methods study from Swedish primary care professional perspective.', ""Health professionals' experience of teamwork education in acute hospital settings: a systematic review of qualitative literature."", 'The experience of adults who choose watchful waiting or active surveillance as an approach to medical treatment: a qualitative systematic review.', 'Reporting and conducting patient journey mapping research in healthcare: A scoping review.', ""Men's perception of information and psychological distress in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer: a comparative mixed methods study."", 'Definition and conceptualization of the patient-centered care pathway, a proposed integrative framework for consensus: a Concept analysis and systematic review.', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'Defining an enabling environment for those with chronic disease: an integrative review.']"""

We have investigated AR function in CARNs (CAstration-Resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells), a luminal stem/progenitor cell that functions in prostate regeneration. Using genetically--engineered mouse models and novel prostate epithelial cell lines, we find that progenitor properties of CARNs are largely unaffected by AR deletion, apart from decreased proliferation in vivo. Furthermore, AR loss suppresses tumor formation after deletion of the Pten tumor suppressor in CARNs; however, combined Pten deletion and activation of oncogenic Kras in AR-deleted CARNs result in tumors with focal neuroendocrine differentiation.

Material and methods:   In a prospective quality registry clinical data were consecutively entered for 544 LRP and 1081 RALP patients operated from 2003 to the end of 2012. Complications within 90 days postoperatively were assessed according to the Clavien classification and compared between LRP and RALP patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses of logistic regression were used to fit oncological outcomes and complication data.  Results:   The mean operation time was 213 and 135 minutes in LRP and RALP patients, respectively. Pathological T3a stage (pT3a) in the RALP group was more frequent than in the LRP group, 32.4% versus 17.8%, respectively. For pT2 tumours, positive surgical margins (PSM) rate for LRP and RALP, was 20.3% vs 10.6%, respectively (p < .001). In the LRP group 74 patients (13.6%) reported 104 and in the RALP group 141 patients (13.0%) reported 177 complications (p = .75).

The standard of care in case of a biochemical recurrence is androgen deprivation treatment, which is associated with morbidity and negative effects on quality of life. A salvage treatment with acceptable toxicity might postpone the start of androgen deprivation treatment, might have a positive influence on the patients' quality of life, and might even be curative. Here, toxicity and biochemical outcome are described after magnetic resonance imaging-guided focal salvage high-dose-rate brachytherapy in patients with radiorecurrent prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Seventeen patients with pathologically proven locally recurrent prostate cancer were treated with focal high-dose-rate brachytherapy in a single 19-Gy fraction using magnetic resonance imaging for treatment guidance. Primary radiotherapy consisted of external beam radiotherapy or low-dose-rate brachytherapy. Tumors were delineated with Ga-68-prostate-specific membrane antigen or F18-choline positron emission tomography in combination with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. All patients had a prostate-specific antigen level of less than 10 ng/mL at the time of recurrence and a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of ≥12 months. Toxicity was measured by using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.  Results:   Eight of 17 patients had follow-up interval of at least 1 year. At a median follow-up interval of 10 months (range 3-40 months), 1 patient experienced a biochemical recurrence according to the Phoenix criteria, and prostate-specific membrane antigen testing revealed that this was due to a distant nodal metastasis. One patient had a grade 3 urethral stricture at 2 years after treatment.  Conclusion:   Focal salvage high-dose-rate brachytherapy in patients with radiorecurrent prostate cancer showed grade 3 toxicity in 1 of 17 patients and a distant nodal metastasis in another patient. Whether this treatment option leads to cure in a subset of patients or whether it can successfully postpone androgen deprivation treatment needs further investigation.""","""['Metha Maenhout', 'Max Peters', 'Marco van Vulpen', 'Marinus A Moerland', 'Richard P Meijer', 'Maurice A A J van den Bosch', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Steven J Frank', 'Jochem R N van der Voort van Zyp']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Salvage brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiation therapy: A comparison of low-dose-rate and high-dose-rate brachytherapy and the importance of prostate-specific antigen doubling time.', 'Salvage low-dose-rate permanent seed brachytherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer: Association between dose and late toxicity.', 'Feasibility of MR imaging/MR spectroscopy-planned focal partial salvage permanent prostate implant (PPI) for localized recurrence after initial PPI for prostate cancer.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Local Salvage Therapies After Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer (MASTER).', 'Focal salvage high-dose-rate brachytherapy with implantable rectum spacer for locally recurrent prostate cancer after initial low-dose-rate with grade 3 rectal toxicity.', 'Linac-based stereotactic salvage reirradiation for intraprostatic prostate cancer recurrence: toxicity and outcomes.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided Reirradiation for Local Recurrence within the Prostate or in the Prostate Bed: One-Year Clinical Results of a Prospective Registry Study.', 'Value of Targeted Biopsies and Combined PSMA PET/CT and mp-MRI Imaging in Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer after Primary Radiotherapy.', 'Salvage Low-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy: Clinical Outcomes of a Phase 2 Trial for Local Recurrence after External Beam Radiation Therapy (NRG Oncology/RTOG 0526).']"""

It also serves as a risk communication tool that facilitates shared treatment decision-making. However, the system is highly complex and therefore difficult to communicate: factors which have been shown to undermine well-informed and high-quality shared treatment decision-making. To systematically explore prostate cancer patients' understanding of the Gleason scoring system (GSS), we assessed knowledge and perceived importance among men who had completed treatment (N = 50). Patients were administered a survey that assessed patient knowledge and patients' perceived importance of the GSS, as well as demographics, medical factors (e.g., Gleason score at diagnosis), and health literacy. Bivariate analyses were conducted to identify associations with patient knowledge and perceived importance of the GSS. The sample was generally well-educated (48% with a bachelor's degree or higher) and health literate (M = 12.9, SD = 2.2, range = 3-15). Despite this, patient knowledge of the GSS was low (M = 1.8, SD = 1.4, range = 1-4). Patients' understanding of the importance of the GSS was moderate (M = 2.8, SD = 1.0, range = 0-4) and was positively associated with GSS knowledge (p < .01). Additionally, GSS knowledge was negatively associated with years since biopsy (p < .05). Age and health literacy were positively associated with patients' perceived importance of the GSS (p < .05), but not with GSS knowledge.

Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate testosterone recovery after ADT cessation. Cox regression analyses were used to determine the factors affecting the recovery of testosterone.  Results:   After ADT, 206 patients (93.2%) recovered to the SC level and 122 patients (55.2%) recovered to the OH level. Patients treated with ADT for ≤18 months recovered to OH in a mean of 6.8 months (74.6%), but patients treated with ADT for >18 months recovered in a mean of 9.7 months (27.5%). In multivariate analyses, age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.915; p<0.001), serum level of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (HR, 1.015; p=0.002), initial testosterone level (HR, 1.002; p=0.002), and ADT duration (HR, 0.915; p<0.001) were associated with recovery to the OH level after ADT withdrawal, and hypertension (HR, 0.697; p=0.029) and duration of ADT (HR, 0.979; p=0.012) were significantly associated with recovery to SC.  Conclusions:   In patients treated with ADT for ≤18 months, testosterone recovers to the OH level more often and faster after ADT cessation. Age, SHBG level, initial testosterone level, and ADT duration are associated with testosterone recovery.""","""['Wook Nam', 'Se Young Choi', 'Sang Jun Yoo', 'Jeman Ryu', 'Jaehoon Lee', 'Yoon Soo Kyung', 'Jae Hyeon Han', 'Dalsan You', 'In Gab Jeong', 'Jun Hyuk Hong', 'Hanjong Ahn', 'Choung-Soo Kim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Investig Clin Urol""","""['Testosterone Recovery Profiles After Cessation of Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Kinetics of testosterone recovery in clinically localized prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy and subsequent short-term adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Hormonal response recovery after long-term androgen deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Conventional methods for the detection of cancer cells are usually tedious and cumbersome. Herein, we report on the use of a particle size analyzer for the convenient size-based differentiation of cancer cells from normal cells. Measurements made using a particle size analyzer revealed that size parameters for cancer cells are significantly greater (e.g., inner diameter and width) than the corresponding values for normal cells (white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes and splenocytes), with no significant difference in shape parameters (e.g., circularity and convexity). The inner diameter of many cancer cell lines is greater than 10 µm, in contrast to normal cells. For the detection of WBC having similar size to that of cancer cells, we developed a PC software ""Cancer Cell Finder"" that differentiates them from cancer cells based on brightness stationary points on a cell surface. Furthermore, the aforementioned method was validated for cancer cell/clusters detection in spiked mouse blood samples (a B16 melanoma mouse xenograft model) and circulating tumor cell cluster-like particles in the cat and dog (diagnosed with cancer) blood samples.

Methods:   A multimodality male pelvic phantom was used to simulate prostate image-guided radiotherapy with the system under evaluation. Target motion was simulated by placing the phantom on a motion platform. The tracking accuracy of the ultrasound system was evaluated using an independent optical tracking system under the conditions of beam-on, beam-off, poor image quality with an acoustic shadow introduced, and different phantom motion cycles. The time delay between the ultrasound-detected and actual phantom motion was investigated. A clinical case example of prostate treatment is presented as a demonstration of the utility of the system in practice.  Results:   Time delay between the motion phantom and ultrasound tracking system is 223 ± 45.2 milliseconds including video and optical tracking system frame rates. The tracking accuracy and precision were better with a longer period. The precision of ultrasound tracking performance in the axial (superior-inferior) direction was better than that in the lateral (left-right) direction (root mean square errors are 0.18 and 0.25 mm, respectively). The accuracy of ultrasound tracking performance in the lateral direction was better than that in the axial direction (the mean position errors are 0.23 and 0.45 mm, respectively). Interference by radiation and image quality do not affect tracking ability significantly. Further, utilizing the tracking system as part of a clinical study for prostate treatment further verified the accuracy and clinical appropriateness.  Conclusions:   It is feasible to use transperineal ultrasound daily to monitor prostate motion during treatment.

Results:   Statistically significant differences in the distribution of the rs1045531 genotypes and alleles were found between prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients undergoing prostate biopsy ( P = .035 and .046, respectively). We found that the rs1045531 AC genotype was significantly associated with a high risk of prostate cancer in the heterozygote model (AC vs CC; odds ratio = 2.383, 95% confidence interval: 1.198-4.741, χ2 = 6.229, P = .013) and the dominant model (AA/AC vs CC; odds ratio = 2.169, 95% confidence interval: 1.112-4.229, χ2 = 5.228, P = .022).

Androgen receptor (AR) antagonists such as enzalutamide are mainstay treatments for castration-sensitive prostate cancer. Though, a majority of patients initially respond to ADT, most will eventually progress to castrate-resistant, due to the development of different mutations on the AR. PCa cells express high telomerase activity, and there is a correlation between the total activity of telomerase and the Gleason score. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of enzalutamide plus a telomerase inhibitor could be more effective than enzalutamide alone in decreasing cell survival.  Methods:   In this study MTT test, RT-qPCR and imagebased cytometry were used to investigate cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle progression of androgen-responsive human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. The cells were treated with 5 μM enzalutamide and 40 μM telomerase inhibitor BIBR 1532, or with their combinations for 72 hrs.  Results:   Enzalutamide and BIBR 1532 alone inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The combinations of the two agents could synergistically induce apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Either inhibition of telomerase by BIBR 1532 or AR blockages by enzalutamide decreased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and the catalytic component of telomerase, hTERT, expression.  Conclusion:   These results suggest that telomerase inhibition therapy may contribute to the efficacy of enzalutamide in the androgen-sensitive PCa model.""","""['Karaca Kaan Gecgel', 'Mustafa Muduroglu', 'Suat Erdogan']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['PCA3 Silencing Sensitizes Prostate Cancer Cells to Enzalutamide-mediated Androgen Receptor Blockade.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Combined N-terminal androgen receptor and autophagy inhibition increases the antitumor effect in enzalutamide sensitive and enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Drug Resistance of Enzalutamide in CRPC.', 'The evolving role of enzalutamide on the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Hydralazine and Enzalutamide: Synergistic Partners against Prostate Cancer.', 'Antithetic hTERT Regulation by Androgens in Prostate Cancer Cells: hTERT Inhibition Is Mediated by the ING1 and ING2 Tumor Suppressors.', 'Transcriptional repression by androgen receptor: roles in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   Overall, 630 patients had an initially negative prostate biopsy between 2007 and 2015, either RTE targeted (n = 213) or systematically (n = 417). Follow-up data, ascertained by a questionnaire, of patients receiving RTE-bx were compared to data of patients receiving systematic biopsy (sbx) using Mann-Whitney-U test and Chi-square test. We performed logistic regression analyses to assess any association with PCa or high-grade PCa occurrence.  Results:   In total, 258 (41%) patients were diagnosed with PCa at repeat biopsy whereof 54 (8.6%) harboured high-grade PCa. PCa occurred in 95 (44.6%) patients with initially negative RTE-bx and in 163 (39.1%) patients with initially negative sbx (p = 0.003). 24 (11.3%) patients receiving RTE-bx and 30 (7.2%) patients receiving sbx were diagnosed with high-grade PCa (p = 0.095).

Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) acquire an abnormal enzymatic activity, resulting in the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate and alterations in cellular metabolism, histone modification, and DNA methylation. Mutant IDH1 has been identified in various human malignancies, and IDH1R132H constituted the vast majority of mutational events of IDH1. Most recent studies suggested that IDH1 mutations define a methylator subtype in PCa. However, the function of IDH1R132H in PCa development and progression is largely unknown. In this study, we showed that the prevalence of IDH1R132H in Chinese PCa patients is 0.6% (2/336). Of note, IDH1R132H-mutant PCa patients lacked other canonical genomic lesions (e.g., ERG rearrangement, PTEN deletion) that are common in most other PCa patients. The in vitro experiment suggested that IDH1R132H can promote proliferation of benign prostate epithelial cell RWPE-1 when under the situation of low cytokine. It could also promote migration capacity of RWPE-1 cells. Mechanistically, IDH1R132H was an important regulator of insulin-like growth factor 1receptor (IGF1R) by downregulating a set of microRNAs (miR-141-3p, miR-7-5p, miR-223-3p). These microRNAs were repressed by the alteration of epigenetic modification to decrease the enrichment of active marker H3K4me3 or to increase repressive marker H3K27me3 at their promoters. Collectively, we proposed a novel model for an IDH1R132H-microRNAs-IGF1R regulatory axis, which might provide insight into the function of IDH1R132H in PCa development.""","""['Lili Zhang', 'Mei Qi', 'Tingting Feng', 'Jing Hu', 'Lin Wang', 'Xinjun Li', 'Wei Gao', 'Hui Liu', 'Meng Jiao', 'Zhen Wu', 'Xinnuo Bai', 'Yifan Bie', 'Long Liu', 'Bo Han']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['miR-410-3p promotes prostate cancer progression via regulating PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Oncogenic microRNA-4534 regulates PTEN pathway in prostate cancer.', 'miR-34c is downregulated in prostate cancer and exerts tumor suppressive functions.', 'Role of lncRNAs in prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Epigenetic Modifications and Modulators in Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrated bioinformatics analysis for identifying key genes and pathways in female and male patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'Long non-coding RNA RPL34-AS1 ameliorates oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced neuronal injury via modulating miR-223-3p/IGF1R axis.', 'Effect of IGFBP2 Overexpression on the Expression of Fatty Acid Synthesis Genes in Primary Cultured Chicken Hepatocytes.', '2-Hydroxyglutarate in Cancer Cells.']"""

Around initial diagnosis, 36 patients were excluded from the study protocol; mp-MRI+MRGB reclassified 25/111 (23%) patients, and 11 patients were excluded at own request. Reasons for reclassification were as follows: GS upgrade (15/25, 60%); cT3 disease (3/25, 12%); suspicion of bone metastases (1/25, 4%); and multifocal disease upon MRGB (6/25, 24%). Repeat examinations after 1 yr showed reclassification in 33/75 patients (44%). Reasons were the following: GS upgrade upon TRUSGB (9/33, 27%); volume progression upon TRUSGB (9/33, 27%); cT3 disease upon mp-MRI (1/33, 3%); GS upgrade upon MRGB (1/33, 3%); volume progression upon MRGB (1/33, 3%); multifocal disease upon MRGB (2/33, 6%); and upgrade or upstage upon both TRUSGB and MRGB (10/33, 30%). On logistic regression analysis, the presence of cancer at initial mp-MRI and MRGB examinations was the only predictor of reclassification after 1 yr (odds ratio 5.9, 95% confidence interval 2.0-17.6).  Conclusions:   Although mp-MRI and MRGB are of additional value in the evaluation of PC patients on AS, the value of mp-MRI after 1 yr was limited. As a considerable percentage of GS ≥7 PC after 1 yr was detected only by TRUSGB, TRUSGB cannot be omitted yet.  Patient summary:   More aggressive tumors are detected if low-risk prostate cancer patients are additionally monitored by magnetic resonance imaging.

Methods and materials:   In this study, 15 patients with prostate cancer lesions visible on multiparametric MRI were selected for the validation. T2-weighted images with 1-mm isotropic voxel size and diffusion weighted images were acquired on a 1.5T Siemens imager. Three-dimensional (3D) TRUS images with 0.5-mm slice thickness were acquired. The investigated registration module was incorporated in the open-source 3D Slicer platform, which can compute rigid and deformable transformations. An extension of 3D Slicer, SlicerRT, allows import of and export to DICOM-RT formats. For validation, similarity indices, prostate volumes, and centroid positions were determined in addition to registration errors for common 3D points identified by an experienced radiation oncologist.  Results:   The average time to compute the registration was 35 ± 3 s. For the rigid and deformable registration, respectively, Dice similarity coefficients were 0.87 ± 0.05 and 0.93 ± 0.01 while the 95% Hausdorff distances were 4.2 ± 1.0 and 2.2 ± 0.3 mm. MRI volumes obtained after the rigid and deformable registration were not statistically different (p > 0.05) from reference TRUS volumes. For the rigid and deformable registration, respectively, 3D distance errors between reference and registered centroid positions were 2.1 ± 1.0 and 0.4 ± 0.1 mm while registration errors between common points were 3.5 ± 3.2 and 2.3 ± 1.1 mm.

In this study, we recruited 391 PCa patients in China and found that PCa patients with high level blood glucose (≥100 mg/dL) trended to have high Gleason score (GS ≥ 7). miRNA-301a levels were significantly higher in prostate cancer than that in normal prostate tissues. Hyperglycaemia or high glucose treatment induced miR-301a expression in prostate tissues or PCa cell lines. miR-301a suppressed the expression of p21 and Smad4, and subsequently promoted G1/S cell cycle transition and cell proliferation in vitro and xenograft growth in nude mice in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of p21 and Smad4 mimicked the effects of miR-301a overexpression. Restoration of p21 and smad4 could interrupt the effects of miR-301a overexpression. Importantly, inhibition of miR-301a severely blocked high glucose-induced PCa cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. These results revealed a novel molecular link between hyperglycaemia and PCa.

In combination with the extracellular matrix, all these cells constitute the tumor microenvironment. In the last decade the role of the tumor microenvironment in cancer progression has gained increased attention and prompted efforts directed to abrogate its deleterious effects on anti-cancer therapies. The immune system can detect and attack tumor cells, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (particularly CD8 T cells) have been associated with improved survival or better response to therapies in colorectal, melanoma, breast, prostate and ovarian cancer patients among others. Contrariwise, tumor-associated myeloid cells (myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs], dendritic cells [DCs], macrophages) or lymphoid cells such as regulatory T cells can stimulate tumor growth via inhibition of immune responses against the tumor or by participating in tumor neoangiogenesis. Herewith we analyzed the chemokine profile of mouse breast tumors regarding their capacity to generate factors capable of attracting and sequestering DCs to their midst. Chemoattractants from tumors were investigated by molecular biology and immunological techniques and tumor infiltrating DCs were investigated for matched chemokine receptors. In addition, we investigated the inflammatory response of breast cancer cells, a major component of the tumor microenvironment, to double-stranded RNA stimulation. By using molecular biology techniques such as qualitative and quantitative PCR, PCR arrays, and immunological techniques (ELISA, cytokine immunoarrays) we examined the effects of dsRNA treatment on the cytokine secretion profiles of mouse and human breast cancer cells and non-transformed cells. We were able to determine that tumors generate chemokines that are able to interact with receptors present on the surface of tumor infiltrating DCs. We observed that PRR signaling is able to modify the production of chemokines by breast tumor cells and normal breast cells, thereby constituting a possible player in shaping the profile of the leukocyte population in the TME.""","""['Amritha Venkatesh', 'Harika Nandigam', 'Maria Muccioli', 'Manindra Singh', 'Tiffany Loftus', 'Deana Lewis', 'Michelle Pate', 'Fabian Benencia']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Immunobiology""","""['Modulation of double-stranded RNA pattern recognition receptor signaling in ovarian cancer cells promotes inflammatory queues.', 'Dendritic cells: In vitro culture in two- and three-dimensional collagen systems and expression of collagen receptors in tumors and atherosclerotic microenvironments.', 'Phenotypic profile of dendritic and T cells in the lymph node of Balb/C mice with breast cancer submitted to dendritic cells immunotherapy.', 'Yin-yang effect of tumor infiltrating B cells in breast cancer: From mechanism to immunotherapy.', 'Monocytes and dendritic cells in a hypoxic environment: Spotlights on chemotaxis and migration.', 'Toll‑like receptor 3 ligands for breast cancer therapies (Review).', 'High expression of TLR3 in triple-negative breast cancer predicts better prognosis-data from the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center cohort and tissue microarrays.', 'The Innate Immune Signalling Pathways: Turning RIG-I Sensor Activation Against Cancer.', 'Two Opposing Faces of Retinoic Acid: Induction of Stemness or Induction of Differentiation Depending on Cell-Type.']"""

Objective:   To update the S3M, to give a detailed account of the value of each predictor in the S3M, and to evaluate the S3M as a reflex test for men with PSA ≥3ng/ml.  Design, setting, and participants:   During 2012-2015, the Stockholm-3 study evaluated the S3M relative to PSA as tests for Gleason score ≥7 prostate cancers among men aged 50-69 yr. The participants (n=59 159) underwent both tests, and biopsy was recommended if at least one was positive. A total of 5073 men had a biopsy because of elevated PSA (≥3ng/ml).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression was used to update the S3M: intact PSA was removed, HOXB13 was included, and the model was fitted to data from the Stockholm-3 training and validation cohorts. To compare S3M with PSA, we fixed the sensitivity for detection of high-grade cancer and evaluated the performance as the number of biopsies needed to achieve that sensitivity for each test.  Results and limitations:   The updated S3M slightly improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve compared to previously published results (0.75 vs 0.74). When used as a reflex test for men with PSA ≥3ng/ml, S3M reduced the number of biopsies needed by 34% compared to the use of PSA alone, with equal sensitivity. A limitation is the ethnically homogeneous population.  Conclusions:   A major problem with PSA screening-too many unnecessary biopsies-can be mitigated if S3M is used as a reflex test.  Patient summary:   To find aggressive prostate cancer with the minimum number of negative biopsies and detection of clinically insignificant cancers, we evaluated the use of a personalized diagnostic prediction model as a second test for men with a positive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.

Purpose:   To apply our newly developed [Fe]MRI method to the quantitative imaging in both space and time of the iron dynamics of anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) conjugated SPIONs within human prostate tumor xenografts in nude mice.  Study type:   Longitudinal.  Animal model:   45 Harlan Sprague Dawley athymic nude mice bearing xenografts from PSMA-positive LNCaP, C4-2 and PSMA-negative DU145 tumors from human prostate tumor cell lines.  Field strength/sequence:   1.0 Tesla/ T1 and T2 weighted spin echo.  Assessment:   Image intensity and contrast measurements.  Statistical tests:   Student's t-test.  Results:   The SPION diffusion coefficient within tumors was D = 44.8 ± 2.4 × 10-6 mm2 /s. The iron taken up by PSMA-positive LNCaP and C4-2 tumors was proportional to the tail-vein injected dose from 60 nmol to 1.6 μmol; injection of 1 μmol of iron in anti-PSMA conjugated SPIONs resulted in a tumor [Fe] of 76 μM. Even at the highest iron dose of 1.6 μmol, the PSMA-negative DU145 tumors took up no significant iron from the anti-PSMA conjugated SPIONs. A similar lack of nonspecific uptake was observed when the antibodies against PSMA were omitted from the injected SPION preparation. The fraction of the initial iron dose that was taken up by PSMA-positive tumors was 2.32 ± 0.75% (n = 10); uptake by the PSMA-negative DU145 tumors and for SPIONs without anti-PSMA antibodies was 0.16 ± 0.34% (n = 7) giving a ratio of [Fe] in PSMA + versus PSMA- tumors greater than 15:1 (P = 0.01).

Methods:   In this prospective study, patients were included before starting new treatment after developing CRPC. The blood samples were collected prior to start of the treatment and at three time points thereafter. cfDNA was extracted from 1.5 mL of plasma and before performing a methylation-specific PCR, bisulfate modification was carried out.  Results:   The median levels of cfDNA, GSTP1, and APC copies in the baseline samples of CRPC patients (n = 47) were higher than in controls (n = 30). In the survival analysis, the group with baseline marker levels below median had significant less PCa-related deaths (P-values <0.02) and did not reach the median survival point. The survival distributions for the groups were statistically significant for the cfDNA concentration, GSTP1 and APC copies, as well as PSA combined with GSTP1 + APC (P-values <0.03). Furthermore, there were strong positive correlations between PSA and marker response after starting treatment (P-values <0.04).  Conclusions:   In conclusion, this study showed the kinetics of methylated cfDNA (GSTP1 and APC) in plasma of CRPC patients after starting treatment.

Adipocytes are the main cell population in adipose tissues and their paracrine role contributes to PCa progression, however its implication in modulating immune reactions remains largely unknown. We investigated the adipocyte role in controlling the susceptibility of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cells to the cytotoxic action of natural killer (NK) cells.  Methods:   Using primary NK cells as the NK cell source, NK cell cytotoxicities to CRPC cells, either control media treated or adipocyte-conditioned media (CM) treated, were tested in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release-based assays. The levels of programmed death receptor ligand (PD-L1) and NK group 2D (NKG2D) ligands in adipocyte CM-treated CRPC cells were analyzed in qPCR analyses. Effects of blocking adipocyte action on altering PD-L1/NKG2D ligand levels and the susceptibility of CRPC cells to NK cell cytotoxicity were investigated.  Results:   We found NK cell cytotoxicity to CRPC cells decreases when tumor cells are treated with adipocyte CM associated with PD-L1 and NKG2D ligand level alterations. Further, we discovered that the JAK/Stat3 signaling pathway was responsible for the adipocyte CM effect. Two adipokine molecules, IL-6 and leptin, were shown to be important in activation of the JAK/Stat3 signaling in CRPC cells to modulate the PD-L1/NKG2D ligand level alteration. Adding the inhibitors of JAK/Stat3 signaling or neutralizing antibodies of IL-6 or leptin increased the susceptibility of CRPC cells to NK cell action.

Since differentiation of both strategies is not always clear, patients were compared with respect to the inclusion criteria, frequency of follow-up examinations (Prostate Specific Antigen = PSA tests, rebiopsies), and initiation of a deferred treatment.  Methods:   HAROW is a non-interventional, health-service research study on the management of localized PCa in the community setting. Of 3169 patients, prospectively enrolled from 2008 to 2013 with a mean follow-up of 28.2 months, 468 chose AS and 126 WW. Treating urologists reported clinical variables, information on therapy and clinical course of disease.  Results:   AS patients were significantly younger and had more low-risk tumors. No differences were seen in the number of PSA tests during follow-up: mean number of PSA tests was 6.08 for AS- and 5.18 for WW patients, more than four PSA tests were reported in 63.9% AS- and 59.5% WW patients (p = 0.136). At least one re-biopsy was performed in 39.7% AS- and 9.5% WW patients (p < 0.001). Discontinuation rates were 23.9% (n = 112) for AS and 11.9% (n = 15) for WW. Most of the AS patients opted for a curative treatment (prostatectomy = 65, radiotherapy = 30), whereas 12 WW patients received a palliative hormone therapy and three patients received radiotherapy.

We analyzed the largest genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia and lung, breast, prostate, ovary, and colon-rectum cancer including more than 220,000 subjects, and included genetic association with smoking behavior. Polygenic enrichment of associations with lung cancer was observed in schizophrenia, and weak enrichment for the remaining cancer sites. After excluding the major histocompatibility complex region, we identified three independent loci jointly associated with schizophrenia and lung cancer. The strongest association included nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and is an established pleiotropic locus shared between lung cancer and smoking.

In the present study, we explored the effects of PLCε on PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) in cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS We assessed PLCε and PTEN expression in human benign prostate tissues compared to prostate cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry. Lentivirus-shPLCε (LV-shPLCε) was designed to silence PLCε expression in DU145 and PC3 cell lines, and the effectiveness was tested by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. MTT assay and colony formation assay were conducted to observe cell proliferation. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect changed PTEN expression in DU145. RESULTS We observed that PLCε expression was reduced in human benign prostate tissues compared to prostate cancer tissues, while PTEN expression showed the opposite trend. Silencing of the PLCε gene significantly inhibited cell proliferation in DU145 and PC3 cell lines. DU145 is a PTEN-expressing cell, while PC3 is PTEN-deficient. After infection by LV-shPLCε, we noticed that PTEN expression was up-regulated in DU145 cells but not in PC3 cells. Furthermore, we found that PLCε gene knockdown decreased P-AKT protein levels, but AKT protein levels were not affected. Immunofluorescence assays showed that PTEN expression had an intracellular distribution change in the DU145 cell line, and Western blot analysis showed that PTEN was obviously up-regulated in cell nucleus and cytoplasm.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), an extensive class of approximately 22 nucleotide noncoding RNAs, are often aberrantly expressed in tissues and fluids from prostate cancer patients, but the mechanisms of how specific miRNAs regulate prostate tumorigenesis and metastasis are poorly understood. Here, miR-888 was identified as a novel prostate factor that promotes proliferation and migration. miR-888 resides within a genomic cluster of 7 miRNA genes (mir-892c, mir-890, mir-888, mir-892a, mir-892b, mir-891b, mir-891a) on human chromosome Xq27.3. Moreover, as miR-888 maps within HPCX1, a locus associated with susceptibility and/or hereditary prostate cancer, it was hypothesized that additional miRNA cluster members also play functional roles in the prostate. Expression analysis determined that cluster members were similarly elevated in metastatic PC3-ML prostate cells and their secreted exosomes, as well as enriched in expressed prostatic secretions urine-derived exosomes obtained from clinical patients with high-grade prostate cancer. In vitro assays revealed that miR-888 cluster members selectively modulated PC3-derived and LNCaP cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation. Mouse xenograft studies verified miR-888 and miR-891a as pro-oncogenic factors that increased prostate tumor growth in vivo Further analysis validated RBL1, KLF5, SMAD4, and TIMP2 as direct miR-888 targets and that TIMP2 is also coregulated by miR-891a. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the entire miR-888 cluster and reveals biological insight.Implications: This work reveals a complex noncoding RNA network in the prostate that could be developed as effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools for advanced prostate cancer.

We observed a reduction in cell motility and aerobic glycolysis in prostate cancer cells with treatment. These changes were not accompanied by a reduction in the ratio of high-energy phosphates or a change in total protein levels of enzymes and transporters involved in glycolysis. However, a decreased ratio of NAD+/NADH was observed, motivating the use of hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HP-MRS) to detect treatment response. Spectroscopic experiments were performed on tumor spheroids, 3D structures that self-organize in the presence of an extracellular matrix. Treated spheroids showed decreased lactate production with on-target inhibition confirmed using IHC, demonstrating that HP-MRS can be used to probe treatment response in prostate cancer spheroids and can provide a biomarker for treatment response.

Previous observations suggested a biochemical antagonism between GPCRs, CXCR4 and CB2 (CNR2), where agonist-bound CXCR4 and agonist-bound CB2 formed a physiologically nonfunctional heterodimer on the membrane of cancer cells, inhibiting their metastatic potential in vitro However, the reduced signaling entities responsible for the observed functional outputs remain elusive. This study now delineates the signaling mechanism whereby heterodimeric association between CXCR4 and CB2, induced by simultaneous agonist treatment, results in decreased CXCR4-mediated cell migration, invasion, and adhesion through inhibition of the Gα13/RhoA signaling axis. Activation of CXCR4 by its cognate ligand, CXCL12, stimulates Gα13 (GNA13), and subsequently, the small GTPase RhoA, which is required for directional cell migration and the metastatic potential of cancer cells. These studies in prostate cancer cells demonstrate decreased protein expression levels of Gα13 and RhoA upon simultaneous CXCR4/CB2 agonist stimulation. Furthermore, the agonist-induced heterodimer abrogated RhoA-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement resulting in the attenuation of cell migration and invasion of an endothelial cell barrier. Finally, a reduction was observed in the expression of integrin α5 (ITGA5) upon heterodimerization, supported by decreased cell adhesion to extracellular matrices in vitro Taken together, the data identify a novel pharmacologic mechanism for the modulation of tumor cell migration and invasion in the context of metastatic disease.Implications: This study investigates a signaling mechanism by which GPCR heterodimerization inhibits cancer cell migration.

These residual cancer cells can persist, locally or at distant sites, for years or decades. Therefore, understanding the pathways that regulate residual cancer cell survival may suggest opportunities for targeting these cells to prevent recurrence. Previously, it was observed that the proapoptotic protein (PAWR/Par-4) negatively regulates residual cell survival and recurrence in mice and humans. However, the mechanistic underpinnings on how Par-4 expression is regulated are unclear. Here, it is demonstrated that Par-4 is transcriptionally upregulated following treatment with multiple drugs targeting the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, and identify the Forkhead family of transcription factors as mediators of this upregulation. Mechanistically, Foxo3a directly binds to the Par-4 promoter and activates its transcription following inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway. This Foxo-dependent Par-4 upregulation limits the long-term survival of residual cells following treatment with therapeutics that target the PI3K-Akt pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that residual breast cancer tumor cell survival and recurrence requires circumventing Foxo-driven Par-4 upregulation and suggest that approaches to enforce Par-4 expression may prevent residual cell survival and recurrence.

With growing use of escalated doses and tighter margins, procedures to limit rectal size variation are needed to reduce prostate motion, increase treatment accuracy, and minimize rectal toxicity. This prospective study was done to determine whether the introduction of an antiflatulent medication would decrease rectal distention at computed tomography (CT) simulation and throughout a course of radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   Patients undergoing a radical course of radiation therapy to the prostate/prostate bed were eligible to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention arm (antiflatulent medication) or the control arm (no medication). For each participant, the number of CT simulation rescans was recorded. Rectal diameters were measured on CT simulation and treatment cone beam CT scans. Acute rectal toxicities were assessed at baseline and weekly using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.0. A χ2 analysis was used to compare the number of participants requiring a rescan in each study arm. Change in rectal diameter over time was assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance.  Results:   A total of 78 patients participated, with equal numbers assigned to each study arm. There was no significant difference between arms in the number of participants requiring a CT simulation rescan (P = .5551). There was no significant variation in rectal diameter between arms (P = .8999); however, there was a significant effect of time (P = .0017) and a significant interaction effect between study arm and time on rectal diameter (P = .0141). No acute rectal toxicities above grade 2 were reported.  Conclusions:   The addition of antiflatulent medication did not affect the frequency of CT simulation rescans. Both time and the interaction between study arm and time had a statistically significant effect on rectal diameter, although neither finding was clinically significant. Instead, standardized bowel preparation education developed for this study may have been sufficient to limit rectal size variation.""","""['Merrylee McGuffin', 'Naila Devji', 'Lyann Kehoe', 'Anne Carty', 'Steve Russell', 'Lisa Di Prospero', 'Carlo DeAngelis', 'Alex Kiss', 'Danny Vesprini', 'Andrew Loblaw', ""Laura D'Alimonte""]""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Hydrogel Spacer Prospective Multicenter Randomized Controlled Pivotal Trial: Dosimetric\xa0and Clinical Effects of Perirectal Spacer Application in Men Undergoing Prostate\xa0Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiation\xa0Therapy.', 'The effect of bowel preparation regime on interfraction rectal filling variation during image guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Phase 2 trial of guideline-based postoperative image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: Toxicity, biochemical, and patient-reported health-related quality-of-life outcomes.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Bowel and Bladder Reproducibility in Image Guided Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Results of a Patterns of Practice Survey.', 'Intrafractional stability of MR-guided online adaptive SBRT for prostate cancer.', 'Treating the primary in low burden metastatic prostate cancer: Where do we stand?']"""

Since dose dense MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin) has mostly replaced traditional MVAC, we compared pathological response and survival rates in patients with locally advanced bladder cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with dose dense MVAC vs gemcitabine and cisplatin.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with urothelial cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent cystectomy at a total of 20 contributing institutions from 2000 to 2015. Patients with cT3-4aN0M0 disease were selected for this analysis. The rates of ypT0N0 and ypT1N0 or less were compared between the gemcitabine and cisplatin, and dose dense MVAC regimens. Two multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models of overall mortality were generated using preoperative and postoperative data.  Results:   Of the patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy during the study period 319 met our inclusion criteria. A significantly lower rate of ypT0N0 was observed in the gemcitabine and cisplatin arm than in the dose dense MVAC arm (14.6% vs 28.0%, p = 0.005). The rate of ypT1N0 or less was 30.1% for gemcitabine and cisplatin compared to 41.0% for dose dense MVAC (p = 0.07). The mean Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival in the gemcitabine and cisplatin, and dose dense MVAC groups were 4.2 and 7.0 years, respectively (p = 0.001). On multivariable cox regression analysis based on preoperative data patients who received gemcitabine and cisplatin were at higher risk for death than patients who received dose dense MVAC (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.25-3.42, p = 0.003). Lymph node invasion (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.15-3.36, p = 0.01) and hydronephrosis (HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.43-3.30, p <0.001) were also associated with higher risk of death.  Conclusions:   In our retrospective cohort of patients with locally advanced bladder cancer dose dense MVAC was associated with higher complete pathological response and improved survival rates compared to gemcitabine and cisplatin.

All the models that incorporated PHI worked better in terms of calibration close to 45° on the slope. In the decision curve analysis, at a threshold probability of 40% we could prevent 82 biopsies, missing only 16 tumors and 5 high-grade tumors.

Counterintuitively, HSD17B4 expression increases in CRPC and predicts poor prognosis. Here, we show that, of five alternative splice forms, only isoform 2 encodes an enzyme capable of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone inactivation. In contrast with other transcripts, functional expression of isoform 2 is specifically suppressed in development of CRPC in patients. Genetically silencing isoform 2 shifts the metabolic balance toward 17β-OH androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone), stimulating androgen receptor (AR) and CRPC development.

Mechanistically, genome-wide DNA breaks are associated with enhanced acetylation of histone H4, leading to BRD4 recruitment, and stable establishment of the DNA repair complex. In support of this, we also show that, in clinical tumor samples, BRD4 protein levels are negatively associated with outcome after prostate cancer (PCa) radiation therapy.

Using the LQ model to represent the response to radiation of tumour and normal tissues, we formulate a constrained non-linear optimization problem in terms of the variables number and sizes of the dose fractions. Quadratic constraints are imposed to guarantee that the damages to the early and late responding normal tissues do not exceed assigned tolerable levels. Linear constraints are set to limit the size of the daily doses. The optimal solutions are found in two steps: i) analytical determination of the optimal sizes of the fractional doses for a fixed, but arbitrary number of fractions n; ii) numerical simulation of a sequence of the previous optima for n increasing, and for specific tumour classes. We prove the existence of a finite upper bound for the optimal number of fractions. So, the optimum with respect to n is found by means of a finite number of comparisons amongst the optimal values of the objective function at the first step. In the numerical simulations, the radiosensitivity and repopulation parameters of the normal tissue are fixed, while we investigate the behaviour of the optimal solution for wide variations of the tumour parameters, relating our optima to real clinical protocols. We recognize that the optimality of hypo or equi-fractionated treatment schemes depends on the value of the tumour radiosensitivity ratio compared to the normal tissue radiosensitivity.

The specific immunostaining for basal cell markers 34BetaE12 and p63 and for alfa-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase (AMACR) in neoplastic cells is commonly used as an ancillary tool to establish benign and malignant glands. In this study we carried out the immunohistochemical reactions for p63, 34BetaE12, and AMACR on 3 different and successive paraffin sections to discriminate malignant and benign prostatic glands, distorted and crushed by the thermal artifacts in 60 radical prostatectomies and 50 TURP samples. All prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma showed the loss of basal cell markers and expression of AMACR, whereas p63 failed to stain the basal cell layer in benign crushed prostatic glands. The same cauterized glands were steadily positive for 34BetaE12. The high percentage of p63 false negative cases in benign distorted and crushed glands could be explained by the thermal artifacts which might cause lack of p63 antigenicity. In contrast, the antigenicity of 34BetaE12 and AMACR seem not to be affected by cautery artifacts. Thus, in cauterized suspicious prostatic glands an immunohistochemistry panel including, p63, 34BetaE12, and AMACR or only 34BetaE12 is recommended.

Lung cancer results in a death higher rate each year compared to colon, breast and prostate cancer combined. Celecoxib is a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX‑2), an enzyme of which the expression is induced by various stimuli, such as inflammation. In addition, celecoxib triggers COX-2 loading on exosomes. Exosomes are small vesicles composed of a lipid bilayer membrane and are found in most biological fluids, such as blood breast milk and urine. In this study, we focused on exosomes containing COX-2 proteins from lung cancer cells to determine their involvement in the interaction with neighbor cells following treatment with celecoxib. We found that celecoxib induced COX-2 expression in both the cytosol and exosomes in lung cancer cells. Exosomes from celecoxib-treated lung cancer cell culture supernatant were isolated and incubated with several types of cells. The THP-1, monocytic leukemia cell line effectively absorbed COX-2 by lung cancer cell-derived exosomes. Following incubation with exosomes, the COX-2 protein level was increased in the THP-1 cells; however, COX-2 mRNA expression was not affected. Moreover, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by THP-1 cells was increased following incubation with exosomes from celecoxib-treated lung cancer cells. Conditioned medium from THP-1 following incubation with exosomes promoted formation in EA.hy926 cells.

We estimated IRs for each study cancer (bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreas, prostate, renal and uterine), standardised by age and sex and explored IR trends over time since treatment initiation. For all cancer analyses, only the first incident targeted cancer was considered. Of 72,917 patients (60% women; mean age at treatment start: 66 years), 3475 developed a study cancer during 259,072 person-years of follow-up. The most common study cancers were prostate (48.1% of study cancers in men), breast (40.0% of study cancers in women) and lung (15.4% of all study cancers). The overall standardised study cancer IR was 5.4 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 5.3-5.6); IRs were similar across individual OAB drugs. The standardised IRs for bladder and prostate cancers, which have symptoms in common with OAB, were highest in the first 6 months of treatment initiation and lower thereafter. In contrast, IRs for other study cancers were nearly constant during follow-up. Cancer IRs did not vary substantially by individual OAB drug.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the human imaging characteristics of [68Ga]THP-PSMA.  Procedures:   [68Ga]THP-PSMA positron emission tomography (PET)/x-ray computed tomography (CT) was performed in 25 patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Urinary and biliary excretion and tumor lesion uptake were quantified using standardized uptake values (SUVs). Imaging characteristics were assessed in terms of non-target organ uptake, background activity, target-to-background ratios (TBRs) of tumor lesions, and frequency of bladder halo artifacts. Findings were compared to a matched cohort of 25 patients undergoing PET/CT with the established agent [68Ga]PSMA I&T.  Results:   Physiologic uptake of [68Ga]THP-PSMA was significantly lower in salivary glands (P < 0.0001), liver (P < 0.0001), spleen (P < 0.0001), and kidneys (P < 0.0001) than with [68Ga]PSMA I&T. While biliary tracer excretion of [68Ga]THP-PSMA was negligible, urinary tracer excretion of [68Ga]THP-PSMA was fast, and significantly higher than for [68Ga]PSMA I&T, contributing to a higher frequency of bladder artifacts. Malignant lesion uptake of [68Ga]THP-PSMA assessed as either SUV or TBR was significantly lower than with [68Ga]PSMA I&T.  Conclusion:   [68Ga]THP-PSMA yields suitable in vivo uptake characteristics. The simplified synthesis method for [68Ga]THP-PSMA may facilitate wider application and higher patient throughput with PSMA imaging. However, direct intraindividual comparison studies are needed to assess the relative performance of [68Ga]THP-PSMA vs other PSMA ligands in terms of clinical detection rate and image quality.""","""['Thorsten Derlin', 'Sebastian Schmuck', 'Cathleen Juhl', 'Steffi Teichert', 'Johanna Zörgiebel', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Sophie M Schneefeld', 'Almut C A Walte', 'James T Thackeray', 'Tobias L Ross', 'Frank M Bengel']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'PSA-stratified detection rates for 68GaTHP-PSMA, a novel probe for rapid kit-based 68Ga-labeling and PET imaging, in patients with biochemical recurrence after primary therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Cold Kit for Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) PET Imaging: Phase 1 Study of 68Ga-Tris(Hydroxypyridinone)-PSMA PET/CT in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', '68Ga-Labeled 2-{3-5-(7-{1-benzyloxycarbonyl-5-2-(4,7,10-tris-carboxymethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododec-1-l)acetylaminopentylcarbamoyl}-heptanoylamino)-1-carboxypentylureido}pentanedioic acid.', '68Ga-Labeled 2-3-(1-carboxy-5-{7-5-carboxy-5-(3-phenyl-2-{3-phenyl-2-2-(4,7,10-tris-carboxymethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododec-1-l)acetylaminopropionylamino}propionylamino)pentylcarbamoylheptanoylamino}pentyl)ureidopentanedioic acid.', 'Good practices for 68Ga radiopharmaceutical production.', 'Cold Kit Labeling: The Future of 68Ga Radiopharmaceuticals?', 'Neurologically asymptomatic cerebral oligometastatic prostate carcinoma metastasis identified on GaGa-THP-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Radiolabelled Peptides for Positron Emission Tomography and Endoradiotherapy in Oncology.', 'The management impact of 68gallium-tris(hydroxypyridinone) prostate-specific membrane antigen (68Ga-THP-PSMA) PET-CT imaging for high-risk and biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.']"""

In the present study, the mRNA levels of GOLPH2 in PDAC cancer tissues were examined using RT‑qPCR. The effects of GOLPH2 on the growth and migration of cancer cells were examined using crystal violet and Boyden chamber assays. The study demonstrated that the expression of GOLPH2 mRNA and protein was elevated in PDAC clinical tissues. The growth and motility of the PDAC cells was enhanced following overexpression of GOLPH2, whereas downregulating the expression of GOLPH2 impaired the growth, motility and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, GOLPH2 was observed to interact with protein kinase B (Akt), which subsequently increased the activity of Akt. In addition, GOLPH2 was revealed as a downstream gene of Ras signaling and promoted the transformation of normal pancreatic cells.

There are currently no approved drugs available for clinical use in cancer chemotherapies to reverse MDR by inhibiting P-glycoprotein. Using computational studies, we previously identified several compounds that inhibit P-gp by targeting its nucleotide binding domain and avoiding its drug binding domains. Several of these compounds showed successful MDR reversal when tested on a drug resistant prostate cancer cell line. Using conventional two-dimensional cell culture of MDR ovarian and prostate cancer cells and three dimensional prostate cancer microtumor spheroids, we demonstrated here that co-administration with chemotherapeutics significantly decreased cell viability and survival as well as cell motility. The P-gp inhibitors were not observed to be toxic on their own. The inhibitors increased cellular retention of chemotherapeutics and reporter compounds known to be transport substrates of P-gp. We also showed that these compounds are not transport substrates of P-gp and that two of the three inhibit P-gp, but not the closely related ABC transporter, ABCG2/BCRP.

Methods:   Lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma of the skin and stomach cancer diagnoses among a cohort of 18,619 re-settlers living in the Saarland between 1990 and 2009 were identified by the federal state's cancer registry. Vital status was available for the respective time-period and used to calculate SIR and SMR in comparison to the autochthonous population. Tumor stages were condensed into local and advanced stages. Odds ratios (OR) for an advanced tumor stage were modeled in dependence of re-settler-status and relevant covariates by logistic regression. Missing values were addressed in a sensitivity analysis. The influence of duration of stay in Germany on advanced stage diagnosis was analyzed among re-settlers.  Results:   SIR and SMR of lung and breast cancer were lower among female re-settlers, while SIR and SMR of colorectal and prostate cancer were lower among male re-settlers. SIR and SMR of stomach cancer were elevated among both sexes. Female re-settlers showed an elevated OR for being diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer. Both male and female re-settlers showed an elevated OR when observing all six sites combined (OR among males 1.47, p = 0.04; OR among females 1.37, p = 0.05). The result of elevated ORs was supported in the sensitivity analysis. Finally, male re-settlers showed a weak association between duration of stay in Germany and reduced risk for advanced stage diagnosis.  Conclusion:   Re-settlers were more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced tumor stage. These findings are in line with previous research having shown unfavorable health care utilization of re-settlers.

Methods:   Included were 7466 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study cohort who at visit 4 (1996-1998) reported being edentulous or underwent the dental examination. Probing depth and gingival recession were measured at six sites on all teeth; these measurements were used to define periodontal disease severity. Incident cancers (n = 1648) and cancer deaths (n = 547) were ascertained during a median of 14.7 years of follow-up. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   An increased risk of total cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 1.44, Ptrend = .004) was observed for severe periodontitis (>30% of sites with attachment loss >3 mm) compared with no/mild periodontitis (<10% of sites with attachment loss >3 mm), adjusting for smoking and other factors. Strong associations were observed for lung cancer (HR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.51 to 3.60, Ptrend < .001), and elevated risks were noted for colorectal cancer for severe periodontitis, which were significant among never smokers (HR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.00 to 4.47). Associations were generally weaker, or not apparent among black participants, except for lung and colorectal cancers, where associations were similar by race. No associations were observed for breast, prostate, or hematopoietic and lymphatic cancer risk.

In DU-145 cells, the activation of ERβ1 by DPN increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of ERβ1 is required to maintain an epithelial phenotype in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. The activation of ERβ1 also increased the expression of β-catenin in cytoplasm of PC-3 and in the cellular membrane of DU-145 cells. In conclusion, our results indicate differential expression and localization of N-cadherin, E-cadherin and β-catenin in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. The reduction of N-cadherin content by activation of ERβ, exclusively observed in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells (PC-3), may be related to the activation of signaling pathways, such as the release of β-catenin into the cytoplasm, translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus and activation of gene transcription.""","""['Rafael de Souza Silva', 'Ana Paola G Lombardi', 'Deborah Simão de Souza', 'Carolina M Vicente', 'Catarina S Porto']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) mediates expression of β-catenin and proliferation in prostate cancer cell line PC-3.', 'Expression and regulation of the estrogen receptors in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Estrogen Receptor Signaling Pathways Involved in Invasion and Colony Formation of Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells PC-3.', 'Roles and regulation of Wnt signaling and beta-catenin in prostate cancer.', 'The role of estrogen receptor β in prostate cancer.', 'Estrogen receptors regulate galectin‑3 in androgen‑independent DU‑145 prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular regulation of prostate cancer by Galectin-3 and estrogen receptor.', 'Aging beyond menopause selectively decreases CD8+ T cell numbers but enhances cytotoxic activity in the human endometrium.', 'Chemotherapy and Physical Therapeutics Modulate Antigens on Cancer Cells.', 'Signal Crosstalk and the Role of Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ) in Prostate Cancer.']"""

We evaluated 1650 patients who underwent template biopsy. The distribution of 993 cancer lesions in 302 prostatectomy specimens was compared with the biopsy data to determine whether each lesion was detected. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and related markers. A medical record number (MRN) was used as a negative control. The cancer positive rate did not change as PSA increased in patients with PV ≥50 mL (P = 0.466), although it increased as PSA increased in patients with PV<50 mL (P = 0.001). The detection rate of cancer lesions decreased as the diameter of the lesions decreased (P = 0.018), but remained unchanged with respect to PV. The diameters of the maximum lesions in patients with PV ≥ 50 mL were significantly smaller than those in patients with PV<50 mL (P = 0.003). In patients with PV ≥ 50 mL, the areas under the ROC curves for PSA-related markers did not differ significantly from that for MRN, although they were significantly greater than that for MRN in patients with PV<50 mL (P < 0.001). These results suggest that an increase in PV is associated with a decrease in size and detectability of cancer lesions resulting in a decrease in biopsy yield. Loss of diagnostic accuracy of markers in patients with PV ≥ 50 mL indicates a decrease in serum levels of PSA produced by prostate cancer, which suggests growth inhibition of the cancer.""","""['Takayoshi Demura', 'Takenori Takada', 'Naohiko Shimoda', 'Takaya Hioka', 'Yoshihumi Iwaguchi', 'Shin Ichihara', 'Hiroko Gotoda']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Volume-based evaluation of serum assays for new prostate-specific antigen isoforms in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Transperineal template-guided prostate biopsy for patients with persistently elevated PSA and multiple prior negative biopsies.', 'Unilateral positive biopsies in low risk prostate cancer patients diagnosed with extended transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy schemes do not predict unilateral prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'When to biopsy and when to stop biopsying.', 'Sonohistology - ultrasonic tissue characterization for prostate cancer diagnostics.', 'Relationships between holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer detection rate and Gleason score in relation to prostate volume as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging cognitive biopsy and standard biopsy.']"""

Anecdotally, radiologists may demonstrate inconsistent reproducibility with this map.  Purpose:   To evaluate interobserver agreement in defining prostate tumor location on mpMRI using the PI-RADSv2 sector map.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   Thirty consecutive patients who underwent mpMRI between October, 2013 and March, 2015 and who subsequently underwent prostatectomy with whole-mount processing.  Field strength:   3T mpMRI with T2 W, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] and b-2000), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE).  Assessment:   Six radiologists (two high, two intermediate, and two low experience) from six institutions participated. Readers were blinded to lesion location and detected up to four lesions as per PI-RADSv2 guidelines. Readers marked the long-axis of lesions, saved screen-shots of each lesion, and then marked the lesion location on the PI-RADSv2 sector map. Whole-mount prostatectomy specimens registered to the MRI served as ground truth. Index lesions were defined as the highest grade lesion or largest lesion if grades were equivalent.  Statistical test:   Agreement was calculated for the exact, overlap, and proportion of agreement.  Results:   Readers detected an average of 1.9 lesions per patient (range 1.6-2.3). 96.3% (335/348) of all lesions for all readers were scored PI-RADS ≥3. Readers defined a median of 2 (range 1-18) sectors per lesion. Agreement for detecting index lesions by screen shots was 83.7% (76.1%-89.9%) vs. 71.0% (63.1-78.3%) overlap agreement on the PI-RADS sector map (P < 0.001). Exact agreement for defining sectors of detected index lesions was only 21.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.4-27.7%) and rose to 49.0% (42.4-55.3%) when overlap was considered. Agreement on defining the same level of disease (ie, apex, mid, base) was 61.4% (95% CI 50.2-71.8%).  Data conclusion:   Readers are highly likely to detect the same index lesion on mpMRI, but exhibit poor reproducibility when attempting to define tumor location on the PI-RADSv2 sector map.

PI3-kinase pathway mediates TGF-β effects on prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. PTEN inhibits PI3-kinase pathway and is frequently mutated in prostate cancers. We investigated possible role(s) of PTEN in TGF-β effects on proliferation and migration in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Expression of PTEN mRNA and proteins were determined using RT-PCR and Western blotting in RWPE1 and DU145 cells. We also studied the role of PTEN in TGF-β effects on cell proliferation and migration in DU145 cells after transient silencing of endogenous PTEN. Conversely, we determined the role of PTEN in cell proliferation and migration after over-expression of PTEN in PC3 cells which lack endogenous PTEN.  Results:   TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 had no effect on PTEN mRNA levels but both isoforms increased PTEN protein levels in DU145 and RWPE1 cells indicating that PTEN may mediate TGF-β effects on cell proliferation. Knockdown of PTEN in DU145 cells resulted in significant increase in cell proliferation which was not affected by TGF-β isoforms. PTEN overexpression in PC3 cells inhibited cell proliferation. Knockdown of endogenous PTEN enhanced cell migration in DU145 cells, whereas PTEN overexpression reduced migration in PC3 cells and reduced phosphorylation of AKT in response to TGF-β.

The aim of this study was to compare MRI/ultrasound-fusion biopsy (fusPbx) with systematic biopsy (sysPbx) in patients undergoing biopsy for AS.  Methods:   Patients undergoing mpMRI and transperineal fusPbx combined with transrectal sysPbx (comPbx) as surveillance biopsy were investigated. The detection of Gleason score upgrading and reclassification according to Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance criteria were evaluated.  Results:   Eighty-three patients were enrolled. PCa upgrading was detected in 39% by fusPbx and in 37% by sysPbx (p = 1.0). The percentage of patients who were reclassified in fusPbx and sysPbx (p = 0.45) were 64 and 59% respectively. ComPbx detected more frequently tumour upgrading than fusPbx (71 vs. 64%, p = 0.016) and sysPbx (71 vs. 59%, p < 0.001) and more patients had to be reclassified after comPbx than after fusPbx or sysPbx alone.  Conclusions:   The combination of fusPbx and sysPbx outperforms both modalities alone with regard to the detection of upgrading and reclassification in patients under AS. Because a high missing rate of significant PCa still exists in both biopsy modalities, a combination of fusPbx and sysPbx should be recommended in these patients.""","""['Angelika Borkowetz', 'Theresa Renner', 'Ivan Platzek', 'Marieta Toma', 'Roman Herout', 'Martin Baunacke', 'Christer Groeben', 'Johannes Huber', 'Michael Laniado', 'Gustavo B Baretton', 'Michael Froehner', 'Stefan Zastrow', 'Manfred P Wirth']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Prospective comparison of transperineal magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasonography fusion biopsy and transrectal systematic biopsy in biopsy-naïve patients.', 'Evaluation of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Classification in the Prediction of Tumor Aggressiveness in Targeted Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound-Fusion Biopsy.', 'Evaluation of Transperineal Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound-Fusion Biopsy Compared to Transrectal Systematic Biopsy in the Prediction of Tumour Aggressiveness in Patients with Previously Negative Biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Role of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging fusion biopsy in active surveillance of prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'MRI-targeted prostate biopsy: the next step forward!', 'Localised prostate cancer: radical prostatectomy or deferred treatment strategy.', 'The role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance-guided biopsy in active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer: A systematic review.']"""

TPS calculated dose distributions were compared with dose distributions as estimated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, calculated with the fast dose calculator (FDC) a system previously benchmarked to full MC. This study analyzed a total of 525 patients for four treatment sites (brain, head-and-neck, thorax and prostate). Dosimetric indices (D02, D05, D20, D50, D95, D98, EUD and Mean Dose) and a gamma-index analysis were utilized to evaluate the differences. The gamma-index passing rates for a 3%/3 mm criterion for voxels with a dose larger than 10% of the maximum dose had a median larger than 98% for all sites. The median difference for all dosimetric indices for target volumes was less than 2% for all cases. However, differences for target volumes as large as 10% were found for 2% of the thoracic patients. For organs at risk (OARs), the median absolute dose difference was smaller than 2 Gy for all indices and cohorts. However, absolute dose differences as large as 10 Gy were found for some small volume organs in brain and head-and-neck patients. This analysis concludes that for a fraction of the patients studied, TPS may overestimate the dose in the target by as much as 10%, while for some OARs the dose could be underestimated by as much as 10 Gy. Monte Carlo dose calculations may be needed to ensure more accurate dose computations to improve target coverage and sparing of OARs in proton therapy.""","""['Pablo Yepes', 'Antony Adair', 'David Grosshans', 'Dragan Mirkovic', 'Falk Poenisch', 'Uwe Titt', 'Qianxia Wang', 'Radhe Mohan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Radiobiological and dosimetric impact of RayStation pencil beam and Monte Carlo algorithms on intensity-modulated proton therapy breast cancer plans.', 'Quantitative evaluation of 3D dosimetry for stereotactic volumetric-modulated arc delivery using COMPASS.', 'Impact of grid size on uniform scanning and IMPT plans in XiO treatment planning system for brain cancer.', 'Is there a role for arcing techniques in proton therapy?', 'Proton Therapy.', 'Pre-treatment analysis of non-rigid variations can assist robust intensity-modulated proton therapy plan selection for head and neck patients.', 'Improving Proton Dose Calculation Accuracy by Using Deep Learning.', 'Dual-energy CT based mass density and relative stopping power estimation for proton therapy using physics-informed deep learning.', 'Treatment of ocular tumors through a novel applicator on a conventional proton pencil beam scanning beamline.', 'Fast, Automated, Knowledge-Based Treatment Planning for Selecting Patients for Proton Therapy Based on Normal Tissue Complication Probabilities.']"""

However, many tumors have a noninflamed microenvironment, and response rates to immunotherapy in melanoma have been <50%. We approached this problem by utilizing immunotherapy (CTLA-4 blockade) combined with chemotherapy to induce local inflammation. In murine models of melanoma and prostate cancer, the combination of chemotherapy and CTLA-4 blockade induced a shift in the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment, with infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells increasing the CD8/Foxp3 T-cell ratio. These changes were associated with improved survival of the mice. To translate these findings into a clinical setting, 26 patients with advanced melanoma were treated locally by isolated limb infusion with the nitrogen mustard alkylating agent melphalan followed by systemic administration of CTLA-4 blocking antibody (ipilimumab) in a phase II trial. This combination of local chemotherapy with systemic checkpoint blockade inhibitor resulted in a response rate of 85% at 3 months (62% complete and 23% partial response rate) and a 58% progression-free survival at 1 year. The clinical response was associated with increased T-cell infiltration, similar to that seen in the murine models.

Even within the high-risk PCa category, not all patients will invariably have a poor prognosis, and improved stratification of this heterogeneous group is needed. In this context, components of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway may have promise as biomarkers, because the available evidence suggests increased Hh pathway activity may confer a poorer outcome in advanced and castrate-resistant PCa. In this study, potential associations between Hh pathway protein expression and clinicopathological factors, including time to biochemical recurrence (BCR), were investigated using a tissue microarray constructed from benign and malignant prostate samples from 75 predominantly high-risk PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Hh signaling activity was found to differ between benign and malignant prostate tissue, with a greater amount of active Hh signaling present in malignant than benign prostate epithelium. High expression of Patched 1 in malignant prostate epithelium was found to be an independent predictor of BCR in high-risk PCa patients. Glioma-associated oncogene 1 may potentially represent a clinically useful biomarker of an aggressive tumor phenotype. Evaluation of Hh signaling activity in PCa patients may be useful for risk stratification, and epithelial Patched 1 expression, in particular, may be a prognostic marker for BCR in high-risk PCa patients.""","""['Annelies Gonnissen', 'Sofie Isebaert', 'Christiaan Perneel', 'Chad M McKee', 'Filip Van Utterbeeck', 'Evelyne Lerut', 'Clare Verrill', 'Richard J Bryant', 'Steven Joniau', 'Ruth J Muschel', 'Karin Haustermans']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Tissue microarray analysis indicates hedgehog signaling as a potential prognostic factor in intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Clinical significance of endothelial cell marker CD34 and mast cell marker CD117 in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Akt Activation Correlates with Snail Expression and Potentially Determines the Recurrence of Prostate Cancer in Patients at Stage T2 after a Radical Prostatectomy.', 'SIGIRR/TIR8, an important regulator of TLR4 and IL-1R-mediated NF-κB activation, predicts biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy in low-grade prostate carcinomas.', 'Tissue-Based MicroRNAs as Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: What Can We Learn from Past Studies?', 'New insight into the role of PTCH1 protein in serous ovarian carcinomas.', 'Persistent Properties of a Subpopulation of Cancer Cells Overexpressing the Hedgehog Receptor Patched.', 'Inhibition of Patched Drug Efflux Increases Vemurafenib Effectiveness against Resistant BrafV600E Melanoma.', 'The clinicopathologic significance of Notch3 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the Multidrug Transporter Ptch1 Potentiates Chemotherapy Efficiency.']"""

It is unclear how frequently this occurs in localized disease and existing detection methods rely on epithelial markers with low specificity and sensitivity. We used multiple methodologies of disseminated tumor cell detection in bone marrow harvested at radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Bone marrow was harvested from 208 clinically localized cases, 16 controls and 5 metastatic cases with peripheral blood obtained from 37 metastatic cases. Samples were evaluated at 4 centers with 4 distinct platforms using antibody enrichment with the AdnaTest (Qiagen®) or VERSA (versatile exclusion based rare sample analysis), or whole sample interrogation with the RareCyte platform (Seattle, Washington) or HD-SCA (high definition single cell assay) using traditional epithelial markers and prostate specific markers. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of these markers by evaluating expression levels in control and metastatic cases.  Results:   EpCAM, NKX3.1 and AR were nonspecifically expressed in controls and in most samples using AdnaTest with no relation to perioperative variables. Only 1 patient with localized disease showed positive results for the prostate specific marker PSA. With the VERSA platform no localized case demonstrated disseminated tumor cells. With the RareCyte and HD-SCA platforms only a single patient had 1 disseminated tumor cell.  Conclusions:   Evaluation across multiple platforms revealed that epithelial markers are nonspecific in bone marrow and, thus, not suitable for disseminated tumor cell detection.

Although indocyanine green is advantageous as a photosensitizer in terms of strong absorption in the near-infrared region, indocyanine green-based cancer treatment is still not approved as a clinical method. Some reasons for this are aggregation at high concentrations, rapid clearance of the photosensitizer from the body, low singlet oxygen quantum yield, and the uncertainty concerning its action mechanism. This in vitro study focuses on two of these points: ""what is the cell inhibition mechanism of indocyanine green-based therapy?"" and ""how the dose-dependent aggregation problem of indocyanine green alters its cell inhibition efficiency?"" The following experiments were conducted to provide insight into these points. Nontoxic doses of indocyanine green and near-infrared laser were determined. The aggregation behavior of indocyanine green was verified through experiments. The singlet oxygen quantum yield of indocyanine green at different concentrations were calculated. Various indocyanine green and energy densities of near-infrared light were applied to prostate cancer, neuroblastoma, and colon cancer cells. An MTT assay was performed at the end of the first, second, and third days following the treatments to determine the cell viability. Temperature changes in the medium during laser exposure were recorded. ROS generation following the treatment was verified by using a Total Reactive Oxygen Species detection kit. An apoptosis detection test was performed to establish the cell death mechanism and, finally, the cellular uptakes of the three different cells were measured. According to the results, indocyanine green-based therapy causes cell viability decrease for three cancer cell lines by means of excessive reactive oxygen species production. Different cells have different sensitivities to the therapy possibly because of the differentiation level and structural differences. The singlet oxygen generation of indocyanine green decreases at high concentrations because of aggregation. Nevertheless, better cancer cell killing effect was observed at higher photosensitizer concentrations. This result reveals that the cellular uptake of indocyanine green was determinant for better cancer cell inhibition.""","""['Mustafa Kemal Ruhi', 'Ayşe Ak', 'Murat Gülsoy']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther""","""['Photo-oxidative killing of human colonic cancer cells using indocyanine green and infrared light.', 'Calcium-carbonate packaging magnetic polydopamine nanoparticles loaded with indocyanine green for near-infrared induced photothermal/photodynamic therapy.', 'Effect of photodynamic therapy based on indocyanine green on expression of apoptosis-related genes in human gingival fibroblast cells.', 'Photodynamic therapy for atherosclerosis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ASCO Meeting abstracts. Combined relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects methods.  Results:   We included 7 articles in this meta-analysis, covering a total of 8660 patients who were used to evaluate cardiovascular toxicity. The use of new hormonal agents was associated with an increased risk of all-grade (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13-1.64; P = .001) and high-grade (RR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.21-2.80; P = .004) cardiac toxicity. The use of new hormonal agents was also associated with an increased risk of all-grade (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.62-2.43; P = .001) and high-grade (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.84-2.77; P = .004) hypertension compared with the controls. Abiraterone was found to significantly increase the risk of both cardiac toxicity and hypertension, whereas enzalutamide significantly increases only the risk of hypertension.

This study aimed to contribute to the nascent cancer prevention literature among trans and gender-nonconforming individuals by ascertaining rates of breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer screening behaviors by gender identity.  Methods:   Publicly available de-identified data from the 2014-2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys were utilized to evaluate rates of cancer screenings by gender identity, while controlling for healthcare access, sociodemographics, and survey year. Analyses were conducted in 2017.  Results:   Weighted chi-square tests identified significant differences in the proportion of cancer screening behaviors by gender identity among lifetime colorectal cancer screenings, Pap tests, prostate-specific antigen tests, discussing prostate-specific antigen test advantages/disadvantages with their healthcare provider, and up-to-date colorectal cancer screenings and Pap tests (p<0.036). Weighted logistic regressions found that although some differences based on gender identity were fully explained by covariates, trans women had reduced odds of having up-to-date colorectal cancer screenings compared to cisgender (cis) men (AOR=0.20) and cis women (AOR=0.24), whereas trans men were more likely to ever receive a sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy as compared to cis men (AOR=2.76) and cis women (AOR=2.65). Trans women were more likely than cis men to have up-to-date prostate-specific antigen tests (AOR=3.19). Finally, trans men and gender-nonconforming individuals had reduced odds of lifetime Pap tests versus cis women (AOR=0.14 and 0.08, respectively), and gender-nonconforming individuals had lower odds of discussing prostate-specific antigen tests than cis men (AOR=0.09; all p<0.05).  Conclusions:   The findings indicate that gender identity disparities in cancer screenings persist beyond known sociodemographic and healthcare factors. It is critical that gender identity questions are included in cancer and other health-related surveillance systems to create knowledge to better inform healthcare practitioners and policymakers of appropriate screenings for trans and gender-nonconforming individuals.""","""['Ariella R Tabaac', 'Megan E Sutter', 'Catherine S J Wall', 'Kellan E Baker']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Prev Med""","""['Ariella R.

Methods:   This retrospective cohort study analyzed claims data collected during the period of 1997-2012 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. We examined geriatric adverse events among patients who had received a diagnosis of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia and whom experienced UR, and compared those who received TURP and medication only. Primary outcomes included urinary tract infection (UTI), UR, inguinal hernia, hemorrhoids, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and bony fracture. We excluded patients who had concomitant prostate cancer, bladder cancer, or a long-term urinary catheter indwelling, as well as those who did not receive α-blocker medication regularly. Those aged <50 or >90 years were also excluded. The enrolled patients were categorized into TURP (n = 1218) and medication only (n = 795) groups. After 1:1 propensity score matching, we recorded and compared patients' characteristics, postoperative clinical outcomes, and geriatric adverse events.  Results:   The TURP cohort had a lower incidence of UTI and UR during the postoperative follow-up period from 2 months to 3 years than did the medication only group (20.7% vs. 28.9% and 12.5% vs. 27.6%, respectively, p < 0.001).

Methods:   41 patients were treated for low-intermediate risk prostate cancer with initial prostate-specific antigen of ≤20 ng ml-1, Gleason score 6-7. Patients had MR/CT fusion for delineation of prostate ±seminal vesicles. CT/MR fusion images were used for delineation and planned using flattening filter free modality. Verification on treatment was cone beam CT imaging with fiducial markers for matching. Patients had Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scoring for genitourinary and gastointestinal symptoms at baseline, week 4, 10 and 18.  Results:   Clinically acceptable plans were achieved for all patients, all plans achieved the objective clinical target volume D99% ≥ 95%, and for planning target volume D95% ≥ 95%. Rectum dose constraints were met for 95.1% for V18 Gy ≤ 35%, 80% V28 Gy ≤ 10%. A total of 32 (78.0%) plans achieved all rectum dose constraints. Grade 1 acute genitourinary symptoms were 53.7% of patients at baseline, 90.2% [95% CI (76.8-97.3%)] (p = 0.0005) at treatment 5, falling to 78.0% (62.4-89.4%) at week 4, and 75.0% (58.8-87.3%) by week 10 and 52.5% (36.1-68.5%) (p = 1.00) at week 18. Acute gastrointestinal symptoms were 5% at baseline, 46.3% [95% CI (30.7-62.6%)] at treatment 5, week 4 43.9% [95% CI (28.5-60.3%)], week 10 25.0% (11.1-42.3%), and declined slightly by week 18 [-20.095% CI (12.7-41.2)] p = 0.039. Overall 75.6% (31/41) of patients experienced Grade 1-2 toxicity during or after treatment.  Conclusion:   This planning and delivery technique is feasible, safe and efficient. A homogeneous dose can be delivered to prostate with confidence, whilst limiting high dose to nearby structures.

Methods:   Between 1995 and 2001, a total of 206 men who were randomized to receive RT either alone or with 6 months of ADT for unfavorable-risk PC and who had a comorbidity score assigned using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 metric comprised the study cohort. Multivariable competing risk regression was used to evaluate the impact of and possible interaction between comorbidity and TTR on PCSM and CVM.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 18.19 years, 30 men (18.6%), 39 men (24.2%), and 92 men (57.1%), respectively, had died of PC, CV disease, or other causes. As TTR increased, PCSM significantly decreased in men with no or minimal (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.53, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.34-0.84 [P =.007]) and moderate to severe (AHR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.14-0.99 [P = .048]) comorbidity. However, increasing TTR significantly increased the risk of CVM among men with moderate to severe comorbidity (AHR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.40-2.49 [P <.001]), but not those with no or minimal comorbidity (AHR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.57-1.29 [P =.46]), leading to a significant interaction between TTR and comorbidity (P = .001).  Conclusions:   The results of the current study indicate that considering an intermittent course of ADT such that the TTR approaches 18 months, instead of continuous long-term administration of ADT, in men with moderate to severe comorbidity and high-risk PC may reduce the increased risk of CVM without increasing the risk of PCSM.

Patient characteristics such as age, race, and Agent Orange (AO) exposure may influence advisability of AS in veterans. The 17-gene assay may improve risk stratification and management selection.  Objectives:   To compare management strategies for PCa at 6 VAMCs before and after introduction of the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) assay.  Study design:   We reviewed records of patients diagnosed with PCa between 2013 and 2014 to identify management patterns in an untested cohort. From 2015 to 2016, these patients received GPS testing in a prospective study. Charts from 6 months post biopsy were reviewed for both cohorts to compare management received in the untested and tested cohorts.  Subjects:   Men who just received their diagnosis and have National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) very low-, low-, and select cases of intermediate-risk PCa.  Results:   Patient characteristics were generally similar in the untested and tested cohorts. AS utilization was 12% higher in the tested cohort compared with the untested cohort. In men younger than 60 years, utilization of AS in tested men was 33% higher than in untested men. AS in tested men was higher across all NCCN risk groups and races, particular in low-risk men (72% vs 90% for untested vs tested, respectively). Tested veterans exposed to AO received less AS than untested veterans. Tested nonexposed veterans received 19% more AS than untested veterans. Median GPS results did not significantly differ as a factor of race or AO exposure.  Conclusions:   Men who receive GPS testing are more likely to utilize AS within the year post diagnosis, regardless of age, race, and NCCN risk group. Median GPS was similar across racial groups and AO exposure groups, suggesting similar biology across these groups. The GPS assay may be a useful tool to refine risk assessment of PCa and increase rates of AS among clinically and biologically low-risk patients, which is in line with guideline-based care.""","""['Julie A Lynch', 'Megan P Rothney', 'Raoul R Salup', 'Cesar E Ercole', 'Sharad C Mathur', 'David A Duchene', 'Joseph W Basler', 'Javier Hernandez', 'Michael A Liss', 'Michael P Porter', 'Jonathan L Wright', 'Michael C Risk', 'Mark Garzotto', 'Olga Efimova', 'Laurie Barrett', 'Brygida Berse', 'Michael J Kemeter', 'Phillip G Febbo', 'Atreya Dash']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Manag Care""","""['Stability of a 17-Gene Genomic Prostate Score in Serial Testing of Men on Active Surveillance for Early Stage Prostate Cancer.', 'A Biopsy-based 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score as a Predictor of Metastases and Prostate Cancer Death in Surgically Treated Men with Clinically Localized Disease.', 'New Histopathological & Genetic Features to Improve Active Surveillance Selection for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Identifying intermediate-risk candidates for active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'Tissue-based multigene expression tests for pretreatment prostate cancer risk assessment: current status and future perspectives.', 'The 17-Gene Genomic Prostate Score Assay Is Prognostic for Biochemical Failure in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy at a Community Cancer Center.', 'Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Current Data.', 'Biomarkers for prostate cancer detection and risk stratification.', 'Adoption of New Risk Stratification Technologies Within US Hospital Referral Regions and Association With Prostate Cancer Management.', 'Impact of a Genomic Test on Treatment Decision in a Predominantly African American Population With Favorable-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Randomized Trial.']"""

The objective of the study was to evaluate the best period between prostate biopsy and 3Tesla mpMRI and searching for predictive factors of intraprostatic blood.  Method:   A prostate biopsy followed by a 4-week prostate MRI (MRIp M1) was performed. In case of hemorrhage, MRI was rescheduled at 8 and 12 weeks (M2/M3). We analyzed the persistant bleeding to identify risk factors: anticoagulant/antiaggregant, post-biopsy side effects, histological criteria.  Results:   In this prospective, single-center study, we included 40 patients followed for suspected prostate cancer between December 2014 and March 2016. At the MRIpM1, blood was found for 97.5 % of the patients. The rates were 90.9 % and 88.9 % respectively at the M2 and M3 mpMRI. Compared to initial blood volume on MRIpM1, a significant decrease in blood volume was observed between M1 and M2 (55 %; P=0.0091). We showed a 75 % decrease between M1 and M3 (P=0.0003). Low urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggesting urinary infection at 4 weeks were significantly correlated with blood volume on MRIpM1 (P=0.0063). The blood volume was higher in case of unconformity between biopsy and mpMRI results for detection of significant tumors (11.3 vs. 2.3; P=0.0051).  Conclusions:   A minimum of 8-week biopsy and mpMRI period would limit post-biopsy hemorrhage, predicted by LUTS suggesting urinary infection.

Thus, we used knockout (KO) mouse models having deletion of the Tgfbr2 gene specifically in osteoblasts (Tgfbr2Col1CreERT KO) or in osteoclasts (Tgfbr2LysMCre KO). We found that PCa-induced bone lesion development was promoted in the Tgfbr2Col1CreERT KO mice, but was inhibited in the Tgfbr2LysMCre KO mice, relative to their respective control Tgfbr2FloxE2 littermates. Since metastatic PCa cells attach to osteoblasts when colonized in the bone microenvironment, we focused on the mechanistic studies using the Tgfbr2Col1CreERT KO mouse model. We found that bFGF was upregulated in osteoblasts from PC3-injected tibiae of Tgfbr2Col1CreERT KO mice and correlated with increased tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, amounts of cancer-associated fibroblasts and osteoclasts. In vitro studies showed that osteoblastogenesis was inhibited, osteoclastogenesis was stimulated, but PC3 viability was not affected, by bFGF treatments.

Patients and methods:   The records of 233 men undergoing prostatectomy with presurgical multiparametric 3T surface body coil MRI were reviewed. All initial films were read by a fellowship-trained body radiologist provided with relevant clinical information. A senior radiologist then reread all pelvic MRIs blinded to the initial interpretation with findings from both readings compared to final pathology. Kappa (κ) scores as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were determined.  Results:   When considering extraprostatic extension (EPE), there was low concordance comparing the initial vs. repeat MRI interpretation (κ = 0.22). Additionally, when the senior radiologist reread his own initial interpretation (n = 93, blinded to initial result), concordance for EPE was greater (κ = 0.36) albeit similarly low. With regard to EPE, a comparison of initial MRI interpretation vs. reread by senior radiologist noted universal improvements in diagnostic characteristics including sensitivity (30.3% vs. 56.1%), specificity (80.2% vs. 88.6%), PPV (37.7% vs. 66.1%), NPV (74.4% vs. 83.6%), and accuracy (66.1% vs. 79.4%).

Material and methods:   FLAME is a phase 3 multicentre RCT (NCT01168479) of patients with pathologically confirmed localized intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer. The standard treatment arm (n = 287) received a dose to the entire prostate of 77 Gy in 35 fractions. The dose-escalated treatment arm (n = 284) received 77 Gy in 35 fractions to the entire prostate, with an integrated boost up to 95 Gy to the multi-parametric MRI-defined (macroscopic) tumour within the prostate. Treatment related toxicity was measured using the CTCAE version 3.0. Grade 2 or worse GU or GI events up to two years were compared between groups by presenting proportions and by Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) analyses for repeated measures.  Results:   Ninety percent of the 571 men randomly assigned between September 2009 and January 2015 had high-risk disease (Ash 2000), of whom nearly 66% were prescribed hormonal therapy up to three years. Median follow-up was 55 months at the time of this analysis. Toxicity prevalence rates for both GI and GU increased until the end of treatment and regressed thereafter, with no obvious differences across treatment groups. Late cumulative GI toxicity rates were 11.1% and 10.2% for the standard and dose-escalated group, respectively. These rates were 22.6% and 27.1% for GU toxicity.

Second malignancies following radiation are also reported and compared with patients undergoing a prostatectomy.  Methods:   Included were patients receiving curative intent external beam radiation treatment for early prostate cancer between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2009. Medical records were reviewed for baseline characteristics, treatment details and outcomes. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to derive the 5-year cumulative incidence of the urological outcomes and second malignancy.  Results:   There were 439 patients identified. The median follow-up was 6.96 years. The median age was 69. A total of 56 patients developed a radiation related urological complication, 25 requiring hospital admission. The 5-year cumulative incidence for an MIUP and admission was 3.95% (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.47-6.28) and 2.24% (95% CI, 1.17-4.27), respectively. There were no open surgical procedures. Further malignancy developed in 27 patients during the 5- to 9-year posttreatment period with a cumulative incidence of 10.7% (95% CI, 7.31-15.51). Of the comparator prostatectomy group, of the 265 eligible patients analyzed, 19 patients developed a second malignancy with a cumulative incidence of 9.92% (95% CI, 6.28-15.48). On log-rank testing, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence rates of second malignancy between 5 and 9 years, following respective treatments (P = 0.8554).  Conclusions:   The incidence of MUIP, hospital admissions and open surgical procedures following radiation is reassuringly low.

However, activating mutations or gene rearrangements among MAPK signaling components, such as Ras and Raf, are not always observed in cancers with hyperactivated MAPK. The mechanisms underlying MAPK activation in these cancers remain largely elusive. Here we discover that genomic amplification of the PPP1CA gene is highly enriched in metastatic human CaP. We further identify an S6K/PP1α/B-Raf signaling pathway leading to activation of MAPK signaling that is antagonized by the PML tumor suppressor. Mechanistically, we find that PP1α acts as a B-Raf activating phosphatase and that PML suppresses MAPK activation by sequestering PP1α into PML nuclear bodies, hence repressing S6K-dependent PP1α phosphorylation, 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic accumulation. Our findings therefore reveal a PP1α/PML molecular network that is genetically altered in human cancer towards aberrant MAPK activation, with important therapeutic implications.""","""['Ming Chen', 'Lixin Wan', 'Jiangwen Zhang', 'Jinfang Zhang', 'Lourdes Mendez', 'John G Clohessy', 'Kelsey Berry', 'Joshua Victor', 'Qing Yin', 'Yuan Zhu', 'Wenyi Wei', 'Pier Paolo Pandolfi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['Steady-State Levels of Phosphorylated Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase 1/2 Determined by Mortalin/HSPA9 and Protein Phosphatase 1 Alpha in KRAS and BRAF Tumor Cells.', 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling is activated in prostate tumors but not mediated by B-RAF mutations.', 'The PI3K/Akt and mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathways in human uveal melanoma cells: interaction with B-Raf/ERK.', 'Dimerization of the kinase ARAF promotes MAPK pathway activation and cell migration.', 'Raf: a strategic target for therapeutic development against cancer.', ""Discovery of a Novel Bloom's Syndrome Protein (BLM) Inhibitor Suppressing Growth and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer."", 'Association of mTORC1‑dependent circulating protein levels with cataract formation: a mendelian randomization study.', 'Ubiquitin-specific proteases in inflammatory bowel disease-related signalling pathway regulation.', 'Ago-RIP Sequencing Identifies New MicroRNA-449a-5p Target Genes Increasing Sorafenib Efficacy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'PPP1R14B Is a Prognostic and Immunological Biomarker in Pan-Cancer.']"""

Conventional contact mode (CM) imaging of live cells is rather slow (scan rate < 0.2 Hz), and as the imaging speed increases, significant deformation of the soft and highly corrugated cell membrane is induced. Such a low speed CM imaging of live biological samples is not only time consuming, but also incapable of capturing dynamic biological evolutions occurring in seconds to minutes. The proposed ASM approach aims to address these issues through two synergetic efforts integrated together. First, an adaptive-scanning technique is proposed to optimally adjust the lateral scanning speed to accommodate the sample topography variation and the probe-sample interaction force, so that the scanning-caused sample deformation is maintained below the threshold value while the overall imaging time is minimized. Secondly, a data-driven iterative feedforward control is integrated to the vertical feedback loop along with a gradient-based optimization of the deflection set-point to substantially improve the tracking of the sample topography while maintaining the vertical sample deformation around the minimal. The ASM technique is experimentally validated through imaging live human prostate cancer cells on AFM. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to the conventional CM imaging, the imaging speed is increased over eight times without loss of tracking the topography details of the live cell membrane, and the probe-sample interaction force is substantially reduced.""","""['Juan Ren', 'Qingze Zou']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Ultramicroscopy""","""['High-speed atomic force microscope imaging: adaptive multiloop mode.', 'High-speed adaptive contact-mode atomic force microscopy imaging with near-minimum-force.', 'An integrated approach to piezoactuator positioning in high-speed atomic force microscope imaging.', 'High-speed atomic force microscopy: imaging and force spectroscopy.', 'High-speed atomic force microscopy imaging of live mammalian cells.']"""

Methods:   We assessed how various single and combined diseases differentially affect life years spent living with disease in Dutch elderly men and women (65+) over their remaining life course. Multistate life table calculations were applied to age and sex-specific disease prevalence, incidence and death rates for the Netherlands in 2007. We distinguished congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease (CHD), breast and prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, diabetes, COPD, stroke, dementia and osteoarthritis.  Results:   Across ages 65, 70, 75, 80 and 85, CHD caused the most time spent living with disease for Dutch men (from 7.6 years at age 65 to 3.7 years at age 85) and osteoarthritis for Dutch women (from 11.7 years at age 65 to 4.8 years at age 85).

The most of cases describe chronic lymphocytic leukemia as the leading lymphoproliferative disease with the tendency towards secondary malignancies development. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has been described in only 2 cases to co-occur with prostate adenocarcinoma (PAC). There are scarce data about the connection between MCL and urology cancers. We presented the first case of synchronous occurrence of MCL and PAC in the same patient in Serbia.  Case report:   A 64-year-old male initially presented with fatigue, splenomegaly, and bicytopenia. The bone marrow biopsy specimen revealed extensive infiltration with MCL. During lymphoma staging procedure prostate enlargement (57 mm) was accidentally found by multislice- computed tomography (MSCT). The serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) was elevated (52 ng/mL; normal values ≤ 4 ng/mL). Transrectal ultrasound biopsy revealed PAC. High Gleason score determined high-risk locally advanced PAC. The patient underwent treatment with chemotherapy and hormone therapy due to the existence of double malignancies. Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) was applied for MCL, and luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, triptorelin, for PAC. Partial response was obtained for MCL, and stable disease for PAC. In a 1.5-year observation period the patient was still disease progression free for both of malignancies.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion is a recurrent biomarker in about 50% of all prostate cancers. However, current screening tools for TMPRSS2-ERG are generally confined to research settings and hence, the development of a rapid, sensitive and accurate assay for TMPRSS2-ERG detection may aid in clinical PCa diagnosis and treatment. Herein, we described a new strategy for non-invasive TMPRSS2-ERG detection in patient urinary samples by coupling of isothermal reverse transcription-recombinase polymerization amplification (RT-RPA) to amplify TMPRSS2-ERG transcripts and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to directly detect the amplicons. This novel coupling of both techniques allows rapid and quantitative TMPRSS2-ERG detection. Our assay can specifically detect as low as 103 copies input of TMPRSS2-ERG transcripts and was successfully applied to clinical PCa urinary samples. Hence, we believe our assay is a potential clinical screening tool for TMPRSS2-ERG in PCa and may have broad applications in detecting other gene fusion transcripts in other diseases.""","""['Kevin M Koo', 'Benjamin McNamara', 'Eugene J H Wee', 'Yuling Wang', 'Matt Trau']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""J Biomed Nanotechnol""","""['High-speed biosensing strategy for non-invasive profiling of multiple cancer fusion genes in urine.', 'Colorimetric TMPRSS2-ERG Gene Fusion Detection in Prostate Cancer Urinary Samples via Recombinase Polymerase Amplification.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.', 'Amplification-Free Detection of Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer Urinary Samples Using mRNA-Gold Affinity Interactions.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Solid-Phase Primer Elongation Using Biotinylated dNTPs for the Detection of a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism from a Fingerprick Blood Sample.', 'Engineering State-of-the-Art Plasmonic Nanomaterials for SERS-Based Clinical Liquid Biopsy Applications.']"""

Moreover, SPARC expression levels were evaluated in a series of prostatic tissues, comparing normal prostate, pre-neoplastic prostate intraepithelial neoplasias and overtly malignant tumors, and also metastasis to its correspondent primary prostate tumors, ascertaining potential association between SPARC and clinicopathological data. Remarkably, SPARC was overexpressed in patients with higher Gleason Score, indicating tumors with poor prognosis, as well as in metastasis, particularly from bone sites, compared with their respective primary tumors.

However, little is known about how miR-182 regulates β-catenin signal molecular and impacts on the tumorigenesis of human prostate cancer. In this study, employing the analyses of qRT-PCR, we found that prostate cancer tissues expressed much more miR-182 than non-cancer tissues did. In vitro studies revealed that overexpression of miR-182 promoted cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and inhibited cell apoptosis; in vivo results demonstrated that silencing of miR-182 mediated by inhibitor dramatically reduced prostate cancer xenograft tumor growth. Importantly, through western blotting analysis, we identified that miR-182 dramatically activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway by targeting multiple negative regulators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, including GSK-3β, APC, CK1 and Axin.

Its approval by the Food and Drug Administration was based on demonstration of an overall survival (OS) benefit in randomized placebo-controlled phase III trials. However, treatment was associated with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline in only a small minority of patients. Understanding the clinical factors that are associated with OS could help guide treatment decisions, including patient selection and the timing of sipuleucel-T relative to other therapies.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively identified 94 mCRPC patients treated with sipuleucel-T from April 2010 to April 2016. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distribution of OS. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to identify the prognostic factors for OS.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 24.9 months, the median OS was 34.9 months. On multivariate analysis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, pretreatment PSA doubling time, and previous abiraterone and/or enzalutamide were significant prognostic factors for OS.

Material & methods:   Fifteen men (age mean=67.13±9.38 years) diagnosed with localized prostate cancer participated in three focus groups, grouped according to the treatment strategies radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and active surveillance.

(2) The decision-making process and the perceived time pressure. (3) The coping strategies, which showed a broad spectrum ranging from distraction and information search to lifestyle changes. (4) The perception of the disease over time. In particular men under active surveillance highlighted the importance of deceleration in their decision making and the role of lifestyle changes.  Discussion:   The time of the diagnosis is still very much present even a long time after the diagnosis has been communicated.

However, few studies have examined its relationship with physiology or have examined BF in men with cancer. This study investigated whether BF is associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity (ie, diurnal salivary cortisol) in men treated for prostate cancer. Positive affect (PA) is proposed as a potential pathway linking BF to diurnal salivary cortisol.  Methods:   A sample of 66 men treated for localized prostate cancer within the prior 2 years completed questionnaires and collected salivary cortisol 3 times per day over 3 consecutive days. Hierarchical linear modeling was used for estimating the effects of BF and PA on cortisol responses as measured by diurnal slope and area under the curve (AUCg). Confidence intervals for indirect effects were estimated using the Monte Carlo method for mediation testing.  Results:   BF was significantly associated with diurnal cortisol slope, controlling for body mass index and age (B = -.12, P = .03), such that greater BF was associated with steeper cortisol slope. Analyses revealed that PA mediated the effect of BF on cortisol slope (Monte Carlo estimation 95% CI = -0.087, -0.001); negative affect did not mediate this relationship.

In the frame of our ongoing program on traditionally used Salvia species from the Mediterranean Area, here we report the biological activities of Salvia aurea, S. judaica and S. viscosa essential oils against human prostate cancer cells (DU-145). The cell viability was measured by 3(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was used to quantify necrosis cell death. Genomic DNA, caspase-3 activity, expression of cleaved caspase-9, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated X (Bax) proteins were analyzed in order to study the apoptotic process. The role of reactive oxygen species in cell death was also investigated. We found that the three essential oils, containing caryophyllene oxide as a main constituent, are capable of reducing the growth of human prostate cancer cells, activating an apoptotic process and increasing reactive oxygen species generation. These results suggest it could be profitable to further investigate the effects of these essential oils for their possible use as anticancer agents in prostate cancer, alone or in combination with chemotherapy agents.""","""['Alessandra Russo', 'Venera Cardile', 'Adriana C E Graziano', 'Rosanna Avola', 'Maurizio Bruno', 'Daniela Rigano']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Cytotoxic and chemosensitization effects of Scutellarin from traditional Chinese herb Scutellaria\xa0altissima\xa0L. in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Tanshinone IIA reduces apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide in the human endothelium-derived EA.hy926 cells.', 'SRJ23, a new semisynthetic andrographolide derivative: in vitro growth inhibition and mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Is apoptosis mediated by reactive oxygen species?', 'Therapeutic benefits of Salvia species: A focus on cancer and viral infection.', 'The effect of 5-α reductase inhibitor on Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell-related inflammatory response in BPH.', 'Chemical composition, anticancer and antibacterial activity of Nepeta mahanensis essential oil.', 'CircSETD3 (hsa_circ_0000567) inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells via downregulation of microRNA-421 expression.', 'Knockdown of lncRNA C5orf66-AS1 inhibits osteosarcoma cell proliferation and invasion via miR-149-5p upregulation.', 'Expression of miR-195 and its target gene Bcl-2 in human intervertebral disc degeneration and their effects on nucleus pulposus cell apoptosis.']"""

In this paper we present a BOO formulation based on group sparsity that simultaneously optimizes non-coplanar beam angles for all fractions, yielding a fraction-variant (FV) treatment plan. Beam angles are selected by solving a multi-fraction fluence map optimization problem involving 500-700 candidate beams per fraction, with an additional group sparsity term that encourages most candidate beams to be inactive. The optimization problem is solved using the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. Our FV BOO algorithm is used to create five-fraction treatment plans for digital phantom, prostate, and lung cases as well as a 30-fraction plan for a head and neck case. A homogeneous PTV dose coverage is maintained in all fractions. The treatment plans are compared with fraction-invariant plans that use a fixed set of beam angles for all fractions. The FV plans reduced OAR mean dose and D 2 values on average by 3.3% and 3.8% of the prescription dose, respectively. Notably, mean OAR dose was reduced by 14.3% of prescription dose (rectum), 11.6% (penile bulb), 10.7% (seminal vesicle), 5.5% (right femur), 3.5% (bladder), 4.0% (normal left lung), 15.5% (cochleas), and 5.2% (chiasm). D 2 was reduced by 14.9% of prescription dose (right femur), 8.2% (penile bulb), 12.7% (proximal bronchus), 4.1% (normal left lung), 15.2% (cochleas), 10.1% (orbits), 9.1% (chiasm), 8.7% (brainstem), and 7.1% (parotids). Meanwhile, PTV homogeneity defined as D 95/D 5 improved from .92 to .95 (digital phantom), from .95 to .98 (prostate case), and from .94 to .97 (lung case), and remained constant for the head and neck case. Moreover, the FV plans are dosimetrically similar to conventional plans that use twice as many beams per fraction.

Our study aimed to analyze the ability of the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score to discern between favorable and non-favorable risk in patients with IRPCa.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the data of 203 IRPCa patients who underwent extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) performed by a single surgeon. Pathologic favorable IRPCa was defined as a Gleason score ≤ 6 and organ-confined stage at surgical pathology. The CAPRA score was compared with two established criteria for the within-group discrimination ability.  Results:   Overall, 38 patients (18.7% of the IRPCa cohort) had favorable pathologic features after RARP. The CAPRA score significantly correlated with established criteria I and II and was inversely associated with favorable pathology (all P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the discriminative ability between favorable and non-favorable pathology was 0.679 for the CAPRA score and 0.610 and 0.661 for established criteria I and II, respectively. During a median 37.8 (interquartile range, 24.6-60.2) months of follow-up, 66 patients (32.5%) experienced biochemical recurrence (BCR). Cox regression analysis revealed that the CAPRA score, as a continuous sum score model or 3-group risk model, was an independent predictor of BCR after RARP.

The Youden index was used to identify the optimal cut-off values for predicting extraprostatic disease. Univariate regression analyses were conducted to estimate the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results were stratified upon zonal location of the index tumor.  Results:   Extraprostatic disease was identified in 103 (56%) patients. The risk of extraprostatic disease was nine times higher in peripheral zone tumors with ADC ≤ 89 (OR 9.1, 95% CI 4.2-19.6), five times higher in MTV ≥ 0.9 ml (OR 5.5, 95% CI 2.6-11.4) and five times higher in case of TCL ≥ 14 mm (OR 4.9, 95% CI 2.3-10.2).

However, specific roles of the LTBPs remain understudied in the context of the primary tumor microenvironment. Herein, we investigated the role of LTBP3 in the distinct processes involved in cancer metastasis. By using three human tumor cell lines of different tissue origin (epidermoid HEp-3 and prostate PC-3 carcinomas and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma) and several metastasis models conducted in both mammalian and avian settings, we show that LTBP3 is involved in the early dissemination of primary cancer cells, namely in the intravasation step of the metastatic cascade. Knockdown of LTBP3 in all tested cell lines led to significant inhibition of tumor cell intravasation, but did not affect primary tumor growth. LTBP3 was dispensable in the late steps of carcinoma cell metastasis that follow tumor cell intravasation, including vascular arrest, extravasation, and tissue colonization. However, LTBP3 depletion diminished the angiogenesis-inducing potential of HEp-3 cells in vivo, which was restorable by exogenous delivery of LTBP3 protein. A similar compensatory approach rescued the dampened intravasation of LTBP3-deficient HEp-3 cells, suggesting that LTBP3 regulates the induction of the intravasation-supporting angiogenic vasculature within developing primary tumors. Using our recently developed microtumor model, we confirmed that LTBP3 loss resulted in the development of intratumoral vessels with an abnormal microarchitecture incompatible with efficient intravasation of HEp-3 carcinoma cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that LTBP3 represents a novel oncotarget that has distinctive functions in the regulation of angiogenesis-dependent tumor cell intravasation, a critical process during early cancer dissemination. Our experimental data are also consistent with the survival prognostic value of LTBP3 expression in early-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, further indicating a specific role for LTBP3 in cancer progression toward metastatic disease.""","""['Elena I Deryugina', 'Ewa Zajac', 'Lior Zilberberg', 'Tomoki Muramatsu', 'Grishma Joshi', 'Branka Dabovic', 'Daniel Rifkin', 'James P Quigley']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['EGFR regulates the development and microarchitecture of intratumoral angiogenic vasculature capable of sustaining cancer cell intravasation.', 'Tumor MMP-1 activates endothelial PAR1 to facilitate vascular intravasation and metastatic dissemination.', 'Comparative analysis of metastasis variants derived from human prostate carcinoma cells: roles in intravasation of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and uPA-mediated invasion.', 'The Extracellular Matrix Modulates the Metastatic Journey.', 'Tumor angiogenesis: MMP-mediated induction of intravasation- and metastasis-sustaining neovasculature.', 'ROCK2-RNA interaction map reveals multiple biological mechanisms underlying tumor progression in renal cell carcinoma.', 'LTA4H extensively associates with mRNAs and lncRNAs indicative of its novel regulatory targets.', 'Exploring the biological function of immune cell-related genes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).', 'Disruption of LTBP4 Inhibition-Induced TGFβ1 Activation Promoted Cell Proliferation and Metastasis in Skin Melanoma by Inhibiting the Activation of the Hippo-YAP1 Signaling Pathway.', 'Host tissue proteomics reveal insights into the molecular basis of Schistosoma haematobium-induced bladder pathology.']"""

Higher LET (Linear Energy Transfer) 12C-ions can overcome cancer radioresistance: DNA lesion complexity increases with LET, resulting in efficient cell killing, i.e. higher Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). However, economic and radiobiological issues hamper 12C-ion clinical amenability. Thus, enhancing proton RBE is desirable.

To maximize the reaction rate, we used sodium borocaptate (BSH) with natural boron content. Boron-Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) uses 10B-enriched BSH for neutron irradiation-triggered alpha particles.

The current study tests the hypothesis that the diet-derived cancer protective compounds, indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), affect the tumor microenvironment by regulation of inflammatory responses in monocytes and macrophages. We also ask whether I3C and DIM act through the aryl hydrocarbon (AHR)-dependent pathway or the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family protein CD84-mediated pathway. The effect of I3C and DIM was examined using the human THP-1 monocytic cell in its un-differentiated (monocyte) and differentiated (macrophage) state. We observed that I3C and DIM inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction of IL-1β mRNA and protein in the monocyte form but not the macrophage form of THP-1. Interestingly, CD84 mRNA but not protein was inhibited by I3C and DIM. AHR siRNA knockdown experiments confirmed that the inhibitory effects of I3C and DIM on IL-1β as well as CD84 mRNA are regulated through AHR-mediated pathways. Additionally, the AHR ligand appeared to differentially regulate other LPS-induced cytokines expression. Hence, cross-talk between AHR and inflammation-mediated pathways, but not CD84-mediated pathways, in monocytes but not macrophages may contribute to the modulation of tumor environments by I3C and DIM in prostate cancer.""","""['Thomas T Y Wang', 'Quynhchi Pham', 'Young S Kim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Indole-3-carbinol induces tumor cell death: function follows form.', 'Immunoregulatory effects of indole-3-carbinol on monocyte-derived macrophages in systemic lupus erythematosus: A crucial role for aryl hydrocarbon receptor.', 'Indole-3-carbinol induces G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through aryl hydrocarbon receptor in THP-1 monocytic cell line.', 'Estrogen receptor alpha as a target for indole-3-carbinol.', ""Indoles Derived From Glucobrassicin: Cancer Chemoprevention by Indole-3-Carbinol and 3,3'-Diindolylmethane."", 'Identification and elucidation of cross talk between SLAM Family Member 7 (SLAMF7) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways in monocytes and macrophages.', 'Transcriptomic signatures reveal a shift towards an anti-inflammatory gene expression profile but also the induction of type I and type II interferon signaling networks through aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in murine macrophages.', 'Differentiation-related genes in tumor-associated macrophages as potential prognostic biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Research Trend and Detailed Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms of Food Bioactive Compounds against Cancer: A Comprehensive Review with Special Emphasis on Probiotics.', 'Circ-Usp10 promotes microglial activation and induces neuronal death by targeting miRNA-152-5p/CD84.']"""

Recent studies have shown that miR-15b-5p (miR-15b) exhibits dual roles by accelerating or blocking tumour progression. However, the molecular mechanisms by which miR-15b contributes to prostate cancer (PCa) are still elusive. Here, miR-15b expression was found significantly up-regulated in PCa in comparison with the normal samples and was positively correlated with age and Gleason score in patients with PCa. Notably, PCa patients with miR-15b high expression displayed a higher recurrence rate than those with miR-15b low expression (P = 0.0058). Knockdown of miR-15b suppressed cell growth and invasiveness in 22RV1 and PC3 cells, while overexpression of miR-15b reversed these effects. Then, we validated that RECK acted as a direct target of miR-15b by dual-luciferase assay and revealed the negative correlation of RECK with miR-15b expression in PCa tissues. Ectopic expression of RECK reduced cell proliferation and invasive potential and partially abrogated the tumour-promoting effects caused by miR-15b overexpression. Additionally, miR-15b knockdown inhibited tumour growth activity in a mouse PCa xenograft model. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-15b promotes the progression of PCa cells by targeting RECK and represents a potential marker for patients with PCa.""","""['Ran Chen', 'Lu Sheng', 'Hao-Jie Zhang', 'Ming Ji', 'Wei-Qing Qian']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['A Comprehensive Review on Function of miR-15b-5p in Malignant and Non-Malignant Disorders.', 'MiR-374b-5p suppresses RECK expression and promotes gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis.', 'MicroRNA-182-5p promotes cell invasion and proliferation by down regulating FOXF2, RECK and MTSS1 genes in human prostate cancer.', 'Tumor-Suppressive Function of miR-30d-5p in Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration by Targeting NT5E.', 'microRNA-200b and microRNA-200c promote colorectal cancer cell proliferation via targeting the reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs.', 'An miRNA Signature Predicts Grading of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.', 'Circ-ABCC4 contributes to prostate cancer progression and radioresistance by mediating miR-1253/SOX4 cascade.', 'A Comprehensive Review on Function of miR-15b-5p in Malignant and Non-Malignant Disorders.', 'Identification of Candidate lncRNA and Pseudogene Biomarkers Associated with Carbon-Nanotube-Induced Malignant Transformation of Lung Cells and Prediction of Potential Preventive Drugs.', 'The histidine phosphatase LHPP: an emerging player in cancer.']"""

This may be improved via needle target optimization, accounting for guidance system errors and image registration errors. As an initial step toward the goal of optimized prostate biopsy targeting, we investigated how needle delivery error impacts tumor sampling probability for two targeting strategies.  Methods:   We obtained MRI and 3D TRUS images from 49 patients. A radiologist and radiology resident assessed these MR images and contoured 81 suspicious regions, yielding tumor surfaces that were registered to 3D TRUS. The biopsy system's root-mean-squared needle delivery error (RMSE) and systematic error were modeled using an isotropic 3D Gaussian distribution. We investigated two different prostate tumor-targeting strategies using (a) the tumor's centroid and (b) a ring in the lateral-elevational plane. For each simulation, targets were spaced at equal arc lengths on a ring with radius equal to the systematic error magnitude. A total of 1000 biopsy simulations were conducted for each tumor, with RMSE and systematic error magnitudes ranging from 1 to 6 mm. The difference in median tumor sampling probability and probability of obtaining a 50% core involvement was determined for ring vs centroid targeting.  Results:   Our simulation results indicate that ring targeting outperformed centroid targeting in situations where systematic error exceeds RMSE. In these instances, we observed statistically significant differences showing 1-32% improvement in sampling probability due to ring targeting. Likewise, we observed statistically significant differences showing 1-39% improvement in 50% core involvement probability due to ring targeting.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that the optimal targeting scheme for prostate biopsy depends on the relative levels of systematic and random errors in the system. Where systematic error dominates, a ring-targeting scheme may yield improved probability of tumor sampling. The findings presented in this paper may be used to aid in target selection strategies for clinicians performing targeted prostate biopsies on any MRI targeted, 3D TRUS-guided biopsy system and could support earlier diagnosis of prostate cancer while it remains localized to the gland and curable.""","""['Peter R Martin', 'Derek W Cool', 'Aaron Fenster', 'Aaron D Ward']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Critical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging targeted, transrectal ultrasound guided transperineal fusion biopsy for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Real-time registration of 3D to 2D ultrasound images for image-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Significance of MRI/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Three-Dimensional Model-Guided, Targeted Biopsy Based on Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Systematic Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Detection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Optimizing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy and detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: the role of core number and location.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate and extracapsular structures in MRI to predict needle deflection in percutaneous prostate intervention.', 'Concurrently bendable and rotatable continuum tubular robot for omnidirectional multi-core transurethral prostate biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasonography fusion guided seed placement in a phantom: Accuracy between 2-seed versus 1-seed strategies.', 'A prospective analysis of robotic targeted MRI-US fusion prostate biopsy using the centroid targeting approach.']"""

Of these 168 lesions, 103 were both 68Ga-PSMA PET-positive and CT-positive, 65 were only 68Ga-PSMA-positive, and 10 were only CT-positive. The Yang test showed that there were significantly more 68Ga-PSMA PET-positive lesions than CT-positive lesions. Association analysis showed that PSA plasma levels were significantly correlated with several 68Ga-PSMA-11-associated parameters in bone metastases, including the degree of tracer uptake (SUVaverage and SUVmax), its transport rate from plasma to the interstitial/intracellular compartment (K1), its rate of binding to the PSMA receptor and its internalization (k3), its influx rate (Ki), and its distribution heterogeneity.  Conclusion: 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT is a useful diagnostic tool in the detection of bone metastases in PC. 68Ga-PSMA PET visualizes more bone metastases than low-dose CT.

Although both have documented roles in prostate carcinoma and many cancer types, the weak immunogenicity of these peptides has remained a major challenge for use in immunotherapy. Here, we describe a novel strategy to inhibit GnRH and VEGF production and assess the effect on the immune responses against these hormones using the RM-1 prostate cancer model. We designed a novel recombinant fusion protein which combined GnRH and VEGF as a vaccine against this tumor. The newly constructed fusion protein hVEGF121-M2-GnRH3-hinge-MVP contains the human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF121) and three copies of GnRH in sequential linear alignment and T helper epitope MVP as an immunogenic vaccine. The effectiveness of the vaccine in eliciting an immune response and attenuating the prostate tumor growth was evaluated. Results showed that administration of a new vaccine effectively elicited humoral and cellular immune responses. We found that, a novel fusion protein, hVEGF121-M2-GnRH3-hinge-MVP, effectively inhibited growth of RM-1 prostate model and effectively promoted immune response. In conclusion, hVEGF121-M2-GnRH3-hinge-MVP is an effective dual mechanism tumor vaccine that limits RM-1 prostate growth.

Study design and setting:   A grounded theory study. We interviewed 69 GPs consulting in primary care practices in Australia (n=40) and the UK (n=29).  Results:   GPs explained their communication practices in relation to their primary goals. In Australia, three different communication goals were reported: to encourage asymptomatic men to either have a PSA test, or not test, or alternatively, to support men to make their own decision. As well as having different primary goals, GPs aimed to provide different information (from comprehensive to strongly filtered) and to support men to develop different kinds of understanding, from population-level to 'gist' understanding. Taking into account these three dimensions (goals, information, understanding) and building on Entwistle et al's Consider an Offer framework, we derived four overarching approaches to communication: Be screened, Do not be screened, Analyse and choose, and As you wish. We also describe ways in which situational and relational factors influenced GPs' preferred communication approach.  Conclusion:   GPs' reported approach to communicating about prostate cancer screening varies according to three dimensions-their primary goal, information provision preference and understanding sought-and in response to specific practice situations. If GP communication about PSA screening is to become more standardised in Australia, it is likely that each of these dimensions will require attention in policy and practice support interventions.""","""['Kristen Pickles', 'Stacy M Carter', 'Lucie Rychetnik', 'Kirsten McCaffery', 'Vikki A Entwistle']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""[""Doctors' approaches to PSA testing and overdiagnosis in primary healthcare: a qualitative study."", ""Doctors' perspectives on PSA testing illuminate established differences in prostate cancer screening rates between Australia and the UK: a qualitative study."", ""General Practitioners' Experiences of, and Responses to, Uncertainty in Prostate Cancer Screening: Insights from a Qualitative Study."", 'Prostate specific antigen testing policy worldwide varies greatly and seems not to be in accordance with guidelines: a systematic review.', 'How well do general practitioners manage laboratory test results for patients with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease?: A systematic review.', 'Strategies used in managing conversations about prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing among family physicians (FPs): a qualitative study.', ""General practitioners' (GPs) understanding and views on breast density in Australia: a qualitative interview study."", 'Attitudes Toward and Use of Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Among Urologists and General Practitioners in Germany: A Survey.', ""Delivering the unexpected-Information needs for PSA screening from Men's perspective: A qualitative study."", 'Evaluating two decision aids for Australian men supporting informed decisions about prostate cancer screening: A randomised controlled trial.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyze 172 consecutive patients undergoing prostate MRI with 315 histopathologically verified lesions. We select all lesions either assigned category 3 or category 4 in the peripheral zone for further analysis. We compare cancer rates with the two-sided chi-squared test. To determine inter-observer agreement about contrast enhancement two blinded radiologists evaluate the subset of category 3 lesions based on the diffusion weighted sequence.  Results:   The frequency of peripheral PI-RADS 3, upgraded PI-RADS 4 and PI-RADS 4 lesions based on markedly low ADC value is 10.8%, 10.8% and 20.3%, respectively. Cancer rates (significant cancer only) in these subgroups are 8.8% (3/34), 23.5% (8/34) and 40.6% (26/64), P < 0.01. Inter-observer agreement is moderate for evaluation of contrast enhancement with kappa values between 0.46 and 0.5.  Conclusion:   We demonstrate a trend of increasing cancer rate from PI-RADSv2 category 3 to upgraded category 4 to category 4 based on markedly low ADC value. Peripheral lesions of intermediary risk in the diffusion weighted sequence account for 21.6% of all prostate lesions encountered. Since it is likely that patient management recommendations will be linked to assessment categories in future versions of PI-RADS, cancer rates in upgraded category 4 and category 4 based on markedly low ADC values should be in a similar range.

Methods:   Four thousand three hundred sixty-three Deaf patients recorded in five UASS, 80 diagnosed between 2005/01/01 and 2014/12/31 were selected from medical records and/or ICD-10 coding. Data regarding cancers were extracted, grouped by stage and compared to literature. Statistical significance was tested with Fisher's Exact Test.  Results:   Eighty patients were selected.

Connexin32 (Cx32; also known as GJB1) is expressed by the polarized cells in epithelia. We discovered two dileucine-based motifs, which govern the intracellular sorting and endocytosis of transmembrane proteins, in the C-terminal tail of Cx32 and explored their role in regulating its endocytosis and gap junction-forming abilities in pancreatic and prostate cancer cells. One motif, designated as LI, was located near the juxtamembrane domain, whereas the other, designated as LL, was located distally. We also discovered a non-canonical motif, designated as LR, in the C-terminal tail. Our results showed that rendering these motifs non-functional had no effect on the intracellular sorting of Cx32. However, rendering the LL or LR motif nonfunctional enhanced the formation of gap junctions by inhibiting Cx32 endocytosis by the clathrin-mediated pathway. Rendering the LI motif nonfunctional inhibited gap junction formation by augmenting the endocytosis of Cx32 via the LL and LR motifs. Our studies have defined distinct roles of these motifs in regulating the endocytosis of Cx32 and its gap junction-forming ability.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.""","""['Anuttoma Ray', 'Parul Katoch', 'Nimansha Jain', 'Parmender P Mehta']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['The carboxyl tail of connexin32 regulates gap junction assembly in human prostate and pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Cysteine residues in the C-terminal tail of connexin32 regulate its trafficking.', 'Phosphorylation on Ser-279 and Ser-282 of connexin43 regulates endocytosis and gap junction assembly in pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Gap junction disorders of myelinating cells.', 'Molecular mechanisms of gap junction mutations in myelinating cells.', 'The Potential Role of Connexins in the Pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis.', 'Identification of a Prognostic Signature Model with Tumor Microenvironment for predicting Disease-free Survival after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Binding of α-synuclein oligomers to Cx32 facilitates protein uptake and transfer in neurons and oligodendrocytes.', 'Acetylation of C-terminal lysines modulates protein turnover and stability of Connexin-32.']"""

Summary answer:   While epididymal CRISPs are not absolutely required for male fertility, they are required for optimal sperm function.  What is known already:   CRISPs are members of the CRISP, Antigen 5 and Pathogenesis related protein 1 (CAP) superfamily and are characterized by the presence of an N-terminal CAP domain and a C-terminal CRISP domain. CRISPs are highly enriched in the male reproductive tract of mammals, including in the epididymis. Within humans there is one epididymal CRISP, CRISP1, whereas in mice there are two, CRISP1 and CRISP4.  Study design, size, duration:   In order to define the role of CRISPs within the epididymis, Crisp1 and Crisp4 knockout mouse lines were produced then interbred to produce Crisp1 and 4 double knockout (DKO) mice, wherein the expression of all epididymal CRISPs was ablated. Individual and DKO models were then assessed, relative to their own strain-specific wild type littermates for fertility, and sperm output and functional competence at young (10-12 weeks of age) and older ages (22-24 weeks). Crisp1 and 4 DKO and control mice were also compared for their ability to bind to the zona pellucida and achieve fertilization.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   Knockout mouse production was achieved using modified embryonic stem cells and standard methods. The knockout of individual genes was confirmed at a mRNA (quantitative PCR) and protein (immunochemistry) level. Fertility was assessed using breeding experiments and a histological assessment of testes and epididymal tissue. Sperm functional competence was assessed using a computer assisted sperm analyser, induction of the acrosome reaction using progesterone followed by staining for acrosome contents, using immunochemical and western blotting to assess the ability of sperm to manifest tyrosine phosphorylation under capacitating conditions and using sperm-zona pellucida binding assays and IVF methods. A minimum of three biological replicates were used per assay and per genotype.  Main results and the role of chance:   While epididymal CRISPs are not absolutely required for male fertility, their production results in enhanced sperm function and, depending on context, CRISP1 and CRISP4 act redundantly or autonomously. Specifically, CRISP1 is the most important CRISP in the establishment of normally motile sperm, whereas CRISP4 acts to enhance capacitation-associated tyrosine phosphorylation, and CRISP1 and CRISP4 act together to establish normal acrosome function. Both are required to achieve optimal sperm-egg interaction. The presence of immune infiltrates into the epididymis of older, but not younger, DKO animals also suggests epididymal CRISPs function to produce an immune privileged environment for maturing sperm within the epididymis.  Limitations reasons for caution:   Caution should be displayed in the translation of mouse-derived data into the human wherein the histology of the epididymis is someone what different. The mice used in the study were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment and were thus not exposed to the full range of environmental challenges experienced by wild mice or humans. As such, the role of CRISPs in the maintenance of an immune privileged environment, for example, may be understated.  Wider implications of the findings:   The combined deletion of Crisp1 and Crisp4 in mice is equivalent to the removal of all CRISP expression in humans. As such, these data suggest that mammalian CRISPs, including that in humans, function to enhance sperm function and thus male fertility. These data also suggest that in the presence of an environmental challenge, CRISPs help to maintain an immune privileged environment and thus, protect against immune-mediated male infertility.  Large scale data:   Not applicable.

Patients and methods:   A prospective study of all urology admissions to a public urology department at a tertiary hospital in a 6-month period was performed. Patients admitted with complications attributable to radiotherapy were included in the study. Data obtained included patient demographics, radiotherapy details, complication type and management required.  Results:   A total of 1198 patients were admitted; 921 (77%) were elective and 277 (23%) were emergency admissions. Thirteen out of the 921 (1.4%) elective admissions and 20 out of the 277 (7.2%) emergency admissions were attributable to radiotherapy complications. Radiotherapy complications was the fourth most common reason for emergency admission, ahead of acute urinary retention. These 33 admissions were accounted for by 21 patients. A total of 39 separate complications attributable to radiotherapy were diagnosed, with some patients having multiple complications. The median (interquartile range) time to onset of complications was 4 (1-9) years. The surgical intervention rate was 67%. The commonest procedures were washout with/without clot evacuation or diathermy in theatre (15.8%) and urethral dilatation/bladder neck incision (15.8%).

Individuals with PC and a personal history of another cancer associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) or Lynch syndrome (LS) may be more likely to carry germline mutations.  Methods:   Participants with PC and a history of cancer were selected from a pancreatic disease registry. Of 1296 individuals with PC, 149 had a relevant history of cancer. If banked DNA was available, a multigene panel was performed for individuals who had not 1) previously had a mutation identified through clinical testing or 2) undergone clinical multigene panel testing with no mutations detected.  Results:   Twenty-two of 124 individuals with PC and another HBOC- or LS-related cancer who underwent genetic testing had a mutation identified in a PC susceptibility gene (18%). If prostate cancer is excluded, the mutation prevalence increased to 23% (21/93). Mutation carriers were more likely to have more than 1 previous cancer diagnosis (P = .001), to have had clinical genetic testing (P = .001), and to meet National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) genetic testing criteria (P < .001). Approximately 23% of mutation carriers did not meet NCCN HBOC or LS testing guidelines based on their personal cancer history and reported cancer history in first-degree relatives.  Conclusion:   At least 18% of individuals with PC and a personal history of other HBOC- or LS-related cancers carry mutations in a PC susceptibility gene based on our data, suggesting that criteria for genetic testing in individuals with PC should include consideration of previous cancer history.

The current practice of CT number-based registration for patient positioning focuses on matching the target and is not sufficient for proton therapy because the proton range depends on the medium traversed by the beam. Patient body deformations and anatomical changes result in range deviation in the target. We propose proton range-based registration to minimize the range deviation.  Methods:   The range was calculated from cone beam-computed tomography (CBCT) of the patient on couch, and the range deviation was the difference of the calculated range from that on the initial (day 1) CBCT. In the investigated prostate cases in which the main cause of range deviation was the rotation of femur bones, and in the investigated abdomen cases in which the main cause of range deviation was body growth and anatomic change, our range-based registration was used to obtain the optimal beam angle by minimizing the range deviation. The new angle was limited to be ±5° from that planned to prevent potentially increased dose to the organs at risk. To demonstrate the benefit of range-based registration, we investigated the range at the voxels on the surface of the target volume. The calculation error of range deviation due to CBCT scatter was investigated by using solid water phantoms with different thicknesses. Range-based registration using both CBCTs and CTs was performed in cases of two patients with pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma and one patient with upper abdominal tumor. The range was represented by the water-equivalent thickness to shorten the computation for online application purposes.  Results:   In the phantom study, the calculation error of range deviation due to CBCT scatter was within 2 mm for a 1-cm thickness change (the mean range deviation was 0.8 mm). In the CT study of the prostate cases, the range deviation (mean ± root-mean-square deviation) on the contour in each slice was efficiently reduced from 3.6 ± 2.8 mm to 2.1 ± 1.4 mm, with most slices being within 3 mm; in the CT study of the abdomen cases, the range deviation of the whole set was reduced from 4.4 ± 1.9 mm to 3.5 ± 2.1 mm. Both the mean and root-mean-square deviation of the range deviation on each treatment day were decreased. The dose coverage on the target was improved and the dose on the OARs was only slightly changed.  Conclusion:   Range-based registration can efficiently mitigate range deviation due to patient positioning and anatomical changes. It can shorten patient positioning time and reduce the patient's dose from CBCT.""","""['Weiguang Yao', 'Matthew J Krasin', 'Jonathan B Farr', 'Thomas E Merchant']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Validation of a deformable image registration technique for cone beam CT-based dose verification.', 'Investigating deformable image registration and scatter correction for CBCT-based dose calculation in adaptive IMPT.', 'Feasibility of CBCT-based proton dose calculation using a histogram-matching algorithm in proton beam therapy.', 'Exposure Risks Among Children Undergoing Radiation Therapy: Considerations in the Era of Image Guided Radiation Therapy.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of scatter rejection and correction performance of 2D antiscatter grids in cone beam computed tomography.']"""

Patients and methods:   Records of all patients with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer were reviewed prior to the intervention (July 2014 to July 2015), and the results of this audit were presented to participating urologists by a clinical champion. Urologists then underwent focused education based on current guidelines. Patterns of imaging use for staging were then re-evaluated (November 2015 to July 2016). Patients were stratified into low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups as described by the D'Amico classification system.  Results:   A total of 144 patients were retrospectively enrolled into the study cohort. The use of diagnostic imaging for staging purposes significantly decreased in men with low- and intermediate-risk disease post intervention. In low-risk patients, the use of CT decreased from 43% to 0% (P = 0.01). A total of 21% of patients underwent bone scans in the pre-intervention group compared with18% in the post-intervention group (P = 0.84).

In this study we describe the use of Pathology Imagebase, a novel reference image library, for setting an international standard in prostate cancer grading.  Methods and results:   The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) recently launched a reference image database supervised by experts. A panel of 24 international experts in prostate pathology reviewed independently microphotographs of 90 cases of prostate needle biopsies with cancer. A linear weighted kappa of 0.67 (95% confidence interval = 0.62-0.72) and consensus was reached in 50 cases. The interobserver weighted kappa varied from 0.48 to 0.89. The highest level of agreement was seen for Gleason score (GS) 3 + 3 = 6 (ISUP grade 1), while higher grades and particularly GS 4 + 3 = 7 (ISUP grade 3) showed considerable disagreement. Once a two-thirds majority was reached, images were moved automatically into a public database available for all ISUP members at www.isupweb.org. Non-members are able to access a limited number of cases.  Conclusions:   It is anticipated that the database will assist pathologists to calibrate their grading and, hence, decrease interobserver variability. It will also help to identify instances where definitions of grades need to be clarified.""","""['Lars Egevad', 'Brett Delahunt', 'Daniel M Berney', 'David G Bostwick', 'John Cheville', 'Eva Comperat', 'Andrew J Evans', 'Samson W Fine', 'David J Grignon', 'Peter A Humphrey', 'Jonas Hörnblad', 'Kenneth A Iczkowski', 'James G Kench', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Katia R M Leite', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Jesse K McKenney', 'Jon Oxley', 'Chin-Chen Pan', 'Hemamali Samaratunga', 'John R Srigley', 'Hiroyuki Takahashi', 'Lawrence D True', 'Toyonori Tsuzuki', 'Theo van der Kwast', 'Murali Varma', 'Ming Zhou', 'Mark Clements']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""[""Re: Comment on Egevad et al., 'Utility of Pathology Imagebase for standardisation of prostate cancer grading'."", ""In reply to Egevad et al.: 'Utility of Pathology Imagebase for standardisation of prostate cancer grading'."", 'Pathology Imagebase-a reference image database for standardization of pathology.', 'International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading of prostate cancer - An ISUP consensus on contemporary grading.', 'SOCS3 Immunohistochemical Expression Seems to Support the 2005 and 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Modified Gleason Grading System.', 'Controversial issues in Gleason and International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) prostate cancer grading: proposed recommendations for international implementation.', 'Evolution, controversies and the future of prostate cancer grading.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Detecting and grading prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens through deep learning techniques.', 'Interobserver reproducibility of perineural invasion of prostatic adenocarcinoma in needle biopsies.', 'Identification of areas of grading difficulties in prostate cancer and comparison with artificial intelligence assisted grading.', 'The 2019 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected data from patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer in the CHAARTED study, a phase III multicentre study conducted between 2006 and 2014. The main outcome of the present analysis was overall survival, assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis or log-rank testing, in the whole cohort according to different prostascores. In addition, patients with different scores were compared according to treatment arm.  Results:   A total of 702 cases had complete baseline data, allowing calculation of prostascores and inclusion in the present analysis. Overall survival was assessed according to prostascores in the entire cohort and the P value for overall survival trend was significant (P < 0.001). Likewise, progression-free survival was assessed according to prostascores in the entire cohort and the P value for progression-free survival trend was also significant (P < 0.001). Overall survival comparisons according to treatment arm were evaluated among different prostascores. Notably, the P value for overall survival difference was not significant for a prostascore = 2 (P = 0.702), but was significant for scores of 3, 4 and 5 (P < 0.05). The cause-specific hazard ratio for cancer-specific survival (adjusted for treatment arm used) was also evaluated. The P value for pairwise comparisons between different scores was significant (P < 0.01) except for the comparison between scores 4 and 5.

However, the missing heritability in (CMM) is still high. For such and in order to identify new genetic factors for CMM, we conducted an exome sequencing study in high-risk CMM patients. Two rounds of exome sequencing were successively performed in 33 and 27 high-risk patients. We focused on genes carrying rare nonsense, frameshift, and splice variants (allelic frequency <1%) that were present in both series of exomes. An extension study was then conducted in a large cohort (1 079 CMM patients and 1 230 Caucasian ethnically matched healthy controls), and the inactivating variants frequency was compared between groups using two-sided Fisher exact test. Two TP53AIP1 truncating mutations were identified in four patients: a frameshift c.63_64insG, p.Q22Afs*81 in two patients from the same family and in the proband of a second family; and a nonsense mutation c.95 C > A, p.Ser32Stop in a patient with multiple CMMs. In all patients, TP53AIP1 truncating variants were strongly associated with CMM risk (two-sided Fisher exact test = 0.004, OR = 3.3[1.3-8.5]). Additionally, we showed that TP53AIP1 mRNA was strongly down-regulated throughout different phases of melanoma progression. TP53AIP1 gene is a TP53 target which plays a key role by inducting apoptosis in response to UV-induced DNA damage. Constitutional mutations of TP53AIP1 had previously been involved in susceptibility to prostate cancer. Our results show that constitutional truncating TP53AIP1 mutations predispose to CMM in the French population.

In this study, overall and age-specific incidence and mortality trends are analyzed in order to present the past and current epidemiological situation of the disease in Navarre (Spain).  Methods:   Population-based incidence data from the 1975-2010 period, provided by the Cancer Registry of Navarre and prostate cancer specific mortality data for 1975-2013, provided by the Spanish Statistical Office, were used in the analysis. Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates, change-points and annual percentage changes (APC) were estimated by joinpoint regression analysis. One-dimensional P-spline models were used to estimate projections up to 2016.  Results:   Considerable increases of cancer incidence rates in men aged 45-74 years were observed, with APC of +4.5% (p<0.001), +9.5% (p<0.001) and +2.4% (p<0.05) in the 1975-1990, 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 periods, respectively. In the older than 74 age-group, an increase of incidence rates in the 1975-1999 period was registered (APC +3.3%, p<0.001), followed by a significant decrease up to 2010 (APC -4.0%, p<0.01). Mortality rates rose until 1995 (APC +2.2%, p<0.001) whereas a decline occurred afterwards up to 2013 (APC -3.4%, p<0.001).  Conclusion:   Even though overall prostate cancer incidence rates seem to have stabilized in 2002-2010 in Navarra, trends were different by age groups: increased in men 45-74 years old and decreased in the 75+ year age-group. A decline in mortality rates was observed in both age groups since about 1995.

In this study, we report that CRPC cells are particularly sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of reengineered tricyclic sulfonamides, a class of molecules that activate the protein phosphatase PP2A, which inhibits multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. Treatment of CRPC cells with small-molecule activators of PP2A (SMAP) in vitro decreased cellular viability and clonogenicity and induced apoptosis. SMAP treatment also induced an array of significant changes in the phosphoproteome, including most notably dephosphorylation of full-length and truncated isoforms of the AR and downregulation of its regulatory kinases in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. In murine xenograft models of human CRPC, the potent compound SMAP-2 exhibited efficacy comparable with enzalutamide in inhibiting tumor formation. Overall, our results provide a preclinical proof of concept for the efficacy of SMAP in AR degradation and CRPC treatment.Significance: A novel class of small-molecule activators of the tumor suppressor PP2A, a serine/threonine phosphatase that inhibits many oncogenic signaling pathways, is shown to deregulate the phosphoproteome and to destabilize the androgen receptor in advanced prostate cancer.

Sphere formation and side population assays suggested that miR-1301-3p promoted the expansion of prostate cancer stem cells, and increased the expression of prostate cancer stem cell-associated genes, such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, CD44, KLF4, c-MYC, and MMP2.

However, published studies include only small patient numbers at low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. For this study, 272 consecutive patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and PSA value between 0.2 and 1ng/ml were included. The 68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/computed tomography (CT) was evaluated, and detection rates were determined and correlated to various clinical variables using univariate and multivariable analyses. Subgroups of patients with very low (0.2-0.5ng/ml) and low (>0.5-1.0ng/ml) PSA values were analyzed. In total, lesions indicative of PC recurrence were detected in 55% (74/134) and 74% (102/138) with very low and low PSA values, respectively. Main sites of recurrence were pelvic or retroperitoneal lymph nodes metastases, followed by local recurrence and bone metastases with higher probability in the low versus very low PSA subgroup. Detection rates significantly increased with higher PSA values, primary pT≥3a, primary pN+ disease, grade group ≥4, previous radiation therapy, and concurrent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in univariate analysis. In a multivariable logistic regression model, concurrent ADT and PSA values were identified as most relevant predictors of positive 68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT. Further, prediction nomograms were established, which may help in estimating pretest PSMA-ligand PET positivity in clinical practice.  Patient summary:   In our study, 68Ga-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-ligand positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) detected recurrent disease after radical prostatectomy in 55% (74/134) and 74% (102/138) of patients with very low (0.2-0.5ng/ml) and low (>0.5-1.0ng/ml) prostate-specific antigen values, respectively. On the basis of these data, it seems reasonable to perform 68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT also in patients with early biochemical recurrence, as it can tailor further therapy decisions (eg, local vs systemic treatment). The established prediction nomograms can further assist urologists in discussions on the use of 68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT with their patients in specific clinical settings.""","""['Isabel Rauscher', 'Charlotte Düwel', 'Bernhard Haller', 'Christoph Rischpler', 'Matthias M Heck', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Matthias Eiber']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Imaging: Predicting 68Ga-PSMA-PET-CT positivity for recurrent disease.', 'Is 68Ga-Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Ready To Simplify the Conundrum of Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer?', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Single Lesion on Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-ligand Positron Emission Tomography and Low Prostate-specific Antigen Are Prognostic Factors for a Favorable Biochemical Response to Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-targeted Radioguided Surgery in Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'The Application of Radiolabeled Targeted Molecular Probes for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Triplet Therapy in Metastatic Castrate Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mCSPC)-A Potential New Standard of Care.', 'PSMA-PET Guided Treatment in Prostate Cancer Patients with Oligorecurrent Progression after Previous Salvage Treatment.', 'Histology and PSMA Expression on Immunohistochemistry in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: Comparison with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Features in Primary Staging.', 'Clinical advancement of precision theranostics in prostate cancer.']"""

Since in silico data revealed that FAM3B can be expressed in prostate tumors, we evaluated the putative role of this cytokine in prostate tumor progression.  Methods:   FAM3B expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR in tumor tissue clinical samples and prostate tumor cell lines. Culture growth and viability of DU145 cell line were evaluated after treatment with either exogenous FAM3B protein obtained from conditioned media (CM) of 293 T cells overexpressing FAM3B or a recombinant FAM3B protein produced in a bacterial host. DU145 cells overexpressing FAM3B protein were produced by lentiviral-mediated transduction of full-length FAM3B cDNA. Cell viability and apoptosis were analyzed in DU145/FAM3B cells after treatment with several cell death inducers, such as TNF-alpha, staurosporine, etoposide, camptothecin, and serum starvation conditions. Anchorage-independent growth in soft agarose assay was used to evaluate in vitro tumorigenicity. In vivo tumorigenicity and invasiveness were evaluated by tumor xenograft growth in nude mice.  Results:   We observed an increase in FAM3B expression in prostate tumor samples when compared to normal tissues. DU145 cell viability and survival increased after exogenous treatment with recombinant FAM3B protein or FAM3B-secreted protein. Overexpression of FAM3B in DU145 cells promoted inhibition of DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine externalization in a time and dose-dependent fashion, upon apoptosis triggered by TNF-alpha. These events were accompanied by increased gene expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, decreased expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and diminished caspase-3, -8 and -9 proteolytic activities. Furthermore, inhibition of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic family proteins with small molecules antagonists decreases protective effects of FAM3B in DU145 cells. When compared to the respective controls, cells overexpressing FAM3B displayed a decreased anchorage- independent growth in vitro and increased tumor growth in xenografted nude mice.

Currently available therapies for hormone-refractory PCa are only marginally effective. Plumbagin (PLB), a natural naphthoquinone isolated from the traditional folk medicine Plumbago zeylanica, is known to selectively kill tumor cells. Nevertheless, antitumor mechanisms initiated by PLB in cancer cells have not been fully defined.  Methods:   MTT assay was used to evaluate the effect of PLB on the viability of cancer cells. Cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were determined by flow cytometry. Protein expression was detected by western blotting. In vivo anti-tumor effect was measured by using tumor xenoqraft model in nude mice.  Results:   In the present study, we found that PLB decreases cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis in DU145 and PC-3 cells. In addition, by increasing intracellular ROS levels, PLB induced a lethal endoplasmic reticulum stress response in PCa cells. Importantly, blockage of ROS production significantly reversed PLB-induced ER stress activation and cell apoptosis. In vivo, we found that PLB inhibits the growth of PCa xenografts without exhibiting toxicity Treatment of mice bearing human PCa xenografts with PLB was also associated with induction of ER stress activation.

There is support for a genetic contribution to this disparity, with evidence of genetic heterogeneity in the underlying risk alleles between populations. Studies of PCa among African men may inform the contribution of genetic risk factors to the elevated disease burden in this population.  Methods:   We conducted an association study of >100 previously reported PCa risk alleles among 571 incidence cases and 485 controls among Uganda men. Unconditional logistic regression was used to test genetic associations and a polygenic risk score (PRS) was derived to assess the cumulative effect of the known risk alleles in association with PCa risk. In an exploratory analysis, we also tested associations of 17 125 421 genotyped and imputed markers genome-wide in association with PCa risk.  Results:   Of the 111 known risk loci with a frequency >1%, 75 (68%) had effects that were directionally consistent with the initial discovery population,14 (13%) of which were nominally significantly associated with PCa risk at P < 0.05. Compared to men with average risk (25th -75th percentile in PRS distribution), Ugandan men in the top 10% of the PRS, constructed of alleles outside of 8q24, had a 2.9-fold (95%CI: 1.75, 4.97) risk of developing PCa; risk for the top 10% increased to 4.86 (95%CI: 2.70, 8.76) with the inclusion of risk alleles at 8q24. In genome-wide association testing, the strongest associations were noted with known risk alleles located in the 8q24 region, including rs72725854 (OR = 3.37, P = 2.14 × 10-11 ) that is limited to populations of African ancestry (6% frequency).  Conclusions:   The ∼100 known PCa risk variants were shown to effectively stratify PCa risk in Ugandan men, with 10% of men having a >4-fold increase in risk.

Methods:   We sequenced 160 genes purported to be involved in carcinogenic pathways in germline DNA samples collected from 96 African American men diagnosed with early-onset prostate cancer (≤55 years at diagnosis).

Results:   We observed three protein-truncating mutations, one in BRCA2 and two in BRIP1 in three African American men diagnosed with early-onset prostate cancer. Furthermore, we observed five rare, mostly private, missense variants among four genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PMS2, and ATM) that were predicted to be deleterious and hence likely pathogenic in our patient sample.

It has been demonstrated to exhibit antiproliferative properties, promote apoptosis, and inhibit cell invasion in a number of cancer cell lines by modulating the NF-κB pathway to downregulate the expression of MMP2 and MM9. It has also been shown to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy when it is combined with other chemotherapy drugs. However, the therapeutic potential of matrine for prostate cancer needs to be further studied.  Methods:   We analyzed KEGG pathways of differential gene expression between matrine-treated and untreated prostate cancer cell lines and identified GADD45B as one of major target genes of matrine based on its role in apoptosis and prognosis value for prostate cancer patients in TCGA database. We further analyzed the expression of GADD45B protein in a tissue microarray and mRNA in TCGA database, and tested the synergistic impacts of matrine and GADD45B overexpression on proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cell DU145.  Results:   Matrine promoted the expression of GADD45B, a tumor suppressive gene that is involved in the regulation of cell cycle, DNA damage repair, cell survival, aging, apoptosis and other cellular processes through p38/JNK, ROS-GADD45B-p38, or other signal pathways. Although GADD45B is elevated in prostate cancer tissues, levels of GADD45B in prostate tumor tissues are reduced at late stage of tumor invasion, and higher levels of GADD45B predict better survivals of prostate cancer patients.

Blood examination was done to estimate fasting plasma glucose and PSA.  Results:   The mean ages of diabetic and non-diabetic patients were 55.2 ± 10.5 and 55.9 ± 10.9 years, respectively. The mean total serum PSA was significantly lower among diabetic than non-diabetic men (1.97 ± 1.05 ng/ml vs. 2.60 ± 1.22 ng/ml, respectively, P = 0.001). The multivariate linear regression analysis showed that age, DM and BMI were independent predictors of serum PSA variation. Age was significantly related to PSA in non-diabetics, but not in diabetic patients.  Conclusion:   Serum PSA level is significantly lower and less age dependent in type 2 diabetic patients than in non-diabetics. Therefore, DM should be considered in setting of PSA threshold when screening for prostate cancer.""","""['Jasim N Al-Asadi', 'Lamia M Al-Naama', 'Muhannad M Abdul-Kareem', 'Fawzi C Mashkoor']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Niger Postgrad Med J""","""['Relationship of prostate-specific antigen to age and testosterone in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus.', 'Prostate size correlates with fasting blood glucose in non-diabetic benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with normal testosterone levels.', 'Prostate-specific Antigen Levels in Moroccan Diabetic Males: A Cross-sectional Study.', 'Hypogonadal obese men with and without diabetes mellitus type 2 lose weight and show improvement in cardiovascular risk factors when treated with testosterone: an observational study.', 'Why are diabetics at reduced risk for prostate cancer?

Materials and methods:   This was a prospective study of 96 patients investigated for prostate cancer. An extended 10-aspiration TRUS-guided FNAB using a 22G Echotip Chiba needle was performed. Inclusion criteria included the presence of one or more of the following: Abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, persistently elevated prostate specific antigen, and abnormal prostatic imaging. A set of traditional sextant aspirations were carried out as well as four laterally guided aspirations taken from the middle base of the peripheral zone on either side. The cancer detection rates of sextant and extended (combination of sextant and lateral) FNAB protocols were determined and compared. The value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   The overall cancer detection rate was 24%. Benign cases were reported in 71.8% of patients and 4.2% reported as suspicious. Of the 23 patients' aspirations positive for malignancy, 16 (69.6%) were detectable by the sextant protocol while the lateral protocol detected 21 (91.3%). Two cancers were detected by the sextant protocol only (where the lateral technique was negative for malignancy), 7 cancers were detected by the lateral protocol only while 14 cancers were positive in both the sextant and lateral protocols. The extended protocol showed a statistically significant 30.4% increase in cancer detection over the traditional sextant (P = 0.007).

Thus, the objective of this study was to synthesize compounds based computational modeling that indicated the pyrido[3,4-b]indole class bind to MDM2, a new cancer target for which there are still no drug on the market.  Methods:   Compounds were synthesized by established methods and tested for antiproliferative activity against a broad range of human cancer cell lines, comprising HCT116 colon, HPAC, MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 pancreatic, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 breast, A375 and WM164 melanoma, A549 lung, and LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer lines. Computational docking was also undertaken.  Results:   The novel pyrido[3,4-b]indoles synthesized exhibited a clear SAR with regards to antiproliferative activity, with potent broad-spectrum anticancer activity with IC50s down to 80, 130, 130 and 200 nM for breast, colon, melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells, respectively. 1-Naphthyl at C1 combined with methoxy at C6 provided the best antiproliferative activity. Thus, compound 11 (1-naphthyl-6-methoxy-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole) showed the highest potency. A mechanistic feature of the compounds as a group is a strongly selective G2/M cell cycle phase arrest. Docking at on MDM2 suggested a hydrogen bond interaction between the 6-methoxy Tyr106, hydrophobic interaction with Val93, pi-pi stacking interactions with Tyr100 and His96 and hydrophobic interactions with Leu54 and Ile99. An N9-methyl group disrupted binding interactions, such as H-bond interactions involving the N9 hydrogen.  Conclusion:   We have identified a novel series of pyrido[3,4-b]indoles with potent broad spectrum anticancer activity towards the most aggressive and difficult to treat cancers including metastatic pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancers, and BRAFV600E mutant melanoma, as well as metastatic colon and prostate cancers.

It has also been documented that AR is expressed in more than 60% of breast tumors, which promotes the growth of estrogen receptor-negative (ER-)/AR-positive (AR+) breast cancer cells. Thus, AR might be a potential therapeutic target for AR-positive/ER-negative breast cancer patients. Previously we reported that in prostate cancer cells proteasome-associated deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14) stabilized AR protein level by removing its ubiquitin chain. In the current study, we studied the USP14-AR protein interaction and cell proliferation status after USP14 reduction or inhibition in breast cancer cells, and our results support the conclusion that targeting USP14 is a novel strategy for treating AR-responsive breast cancer. We found that inhibition of USP14 accelerated the K48-ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of AR protein. Additionally, both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of USP14 significantly suppressed cell proliferation in AR-responsive breast cancer cells by blocking G0/G1 to S phase transition and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, AR overexpression inhibited USP14 inhibition-induced events, suggesting that AR deubiquitination by USP14 is critical for breast cancer growth and USP14 inhibition is a possible strategy to treat AR-positive breast cancer.""","""['Yuning Liao', 'Xiaohong Xia', 'Ningning Liu', 'Jianyu Cai', 'Zhiqiang Guo', 'Yanling Li', 'Lili Jiang', 'Q Ping Dou', 'Daolin Tang', 'Hongbiao Huang', 'Jinbao Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Proteasome-associated deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 14 regulates prostate cancer proliferation by deubiquitinating and stabilizing androgen receptor.', 'Inhibition of USP14 enhances the sensitivity of breast cancer to enzalutamide.', 'Selective degradation of AR-V7 to overcome castration resistance of prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor signaling pathways as a target for breast cancer treatment.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting proteasomal deubiquitinases USP14 and UCHL5 with b-AP15 reduces 5-fluorouracil resistance in colorectal cancer cells.', 'Nuclear transport maintenance of USP22-AR by Importin-7 promotes breast cancer progression.', 'A review of deubiquitinases and thier roles in tumorigenesis and development.', 'Neddylation of HER2 Inhibits its Protein Degradation and promotes Breast Cancer Progression.', 'USP14 regulates cell cycle progression through deubiquitinating CDK1 in breast cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Our Markov model allowed patients to transition between health states with yearly probabilities of developing cancer recurrence and/or toxicity. Probabilities were assigned according to favorable intermediate, unfavorable intermediate, or high-risk prostate cancer groups. The primary analysis examined outcomes for patients aged 65 years, whereas secondary analyses explored the effects of younger age, elevated baseline cardiovascular risk, and the use of salvage therapy. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.  Results:   Across all primary and secondary analyses, and using a wide-range of assumptions, RT + ADT was the preferred treatment strategy for men with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer. The QALE was higher after RT + ADT by 0.5 to 1.14 quality-adjusted life years, compared with RP. Radiation plus ADT was cost-effective in all situations, falling beneath a threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year. Among all risk groups, a greater proportion of patients undergoing RP experienced single or multiple treatment toxicities.  Conclusions:   Radiation plus ADT may result in improved QALE compared with RP for intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer.

CASC2 acts as a tumor suppressor in human malignancies serving as a ceRNA for miRNAs; Sprouty2 (SPRY2), a key antagonist of RTK signaling, also serves as a tumor suppressor. Herein, CASC2 and SPRY2 expression was down-regulated in PC tissues and cell lines; the overexpression of CASC2 and SPRY2 could suppress PC cell proliferation, promote PC cell apoptosis, and enhance the sensitivity of PC cells to docetaxel. CASC2 positively regulated SPRY2 expression and inhibited downstream extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) signaling activation through SPRY2. By using online tools, miR-183 might be a direct target of CASC2, and might simultaneously bind to the 3'UTR of SPRY2. The direct binding between CASC2, miR-183 and SPRY2 was then validated; miR-183 inhibition enhanced the cytotoxicity of docetaxel on PC cells, which could be partially attenuated by SPRY2 knockdown. In summary, CASC2 competes with SPRY2 for miR-183 binding to rescue the expression of SPRY2 in PC cells, thus enhancing the sensitivity of PC cells to docetaxel through SPRY2 downstream ERK signaling pathway; CASC2 and SPRY2 might be novel adjuvants for docetaxel-based chemotherapy for PC.""","""['Weiyin Gao', 'Shuangquan Lin', 'Cheng Cheng', 'Anyi Zhu', 'Yingbo Hu', 'Zimin Shi', 'Xiao Zhang', 'Zhengdong Hong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Arch Biochem Biophys""","""['Long non-coding RNA CASC2 enhances cisplatin sensitivity in oral squamous cell cancer cells by the miR-31-5p/KANK1 axis.', 'LncRNA CASC2 Interacts With miR-181a to Modulate Glioma Growth and Resistance to TMZ Through PTEN Pathway.', 'lncRNA CASC2 Enhances 131I Sensitivity in Papillary Thyroid Cancer by Sponging miR-155.', 'CASC2: An emerging tumour-suppressing long noncoding RNA in human cancers and melanoma.', 'Long non-coding RNA CASC2 in human cancer.', 'The miR-183 Cluster: Biogenesis, Functions, and Cell Communication via Exosomes in Cancer.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer resistance leads to a global deregulation of translation factors and unconventional translation.', 'Navigating the genomic instability mine field of osteosarcoma to better understand implications of non-coding RNAs.', 'MiR-182-5p Modulates Prostate Cancer Aggressive Phenotypes by Targeting EMT Associated Pathways.']"""

Material and methods:   75 patients with 888 consecutive histopathologically verified lesions were included in this study. Step 1, an initial 5-point scoring system was developed based on conventional transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). Step 2, a final scoring system was evaluated according to contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasound (CE-TRUS). Each lesion was evaluated using the two-step scoring system (step 1 + step 2) and compared with only using conventional TRUS (step 1).  Results:   888 lesions were histologically verified: 315 of them were prostate cancer from 46 patients and 573 were benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) from 29 patients. According to the two-step scoring system, 284 lesions were upgraded and 130 lesions were downgraded from step 1 to step 2 (this means using step 2 to assess the results by step 1). However, 96 cases were improperly upgraded after step 2 and 48 malignant lesions were still missed after step 2 as score-1. For the two-step scoring system, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 84.7%, 83.2%, and 83.7%, respectively, versus 22.8%, 96.6%, and 70.4%, respectively, for conventional TRUS. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for lesion diagnosis was 0.799-0.952 for the two-step scoring system, versus 0.479-0.712 for conventional TRUS. The difference in the diagnostic accuracy of the two-step scoring system and conventional TRUS was statistically significant (P<0.0001).

Consequently, there has been a rapid uptake in the use of focal ablative therapies. However, there are several biological and practical concerns about such approaches as they have yet to be proved as robust treatment options. In particular, the multifocal nature of prostate cancer argues against unifocal treatment, while limitations in imaging can preclude the accurate identification of the number, location, and extent of prostate cancer foci. To date, a number of ablative options have reported results on mainly low-risk disease. Most series are relatively immature, with a lack of consistent follow-up, and the morbidity of retreatment is often not considered. The authors consider focal therapy to be an investigational modality, and encourage prospective recording of outcomes and recruitment of suitable patients.  Patient summary:   Focal therapy of prostate cancer is the targeted destruction of cancer within a specific part of the prostate gland, sparing the rest of the prostate and nearby tissue. This procedure could potentially reduce side effects when compared with established standard treatments, such as surgery or radiotherapy, which treat the entire prostate. Studies show that for most men with low-risk cancer, active surveillance is the preferred treatment option. However, the available data regarding all forms of focal therapy are still poor and inconclusive. Consequently, due to both the lack of clear results associated with focal therapy and the difficulties in detecting all cancerous areas of the prostate, focal therapy should be considered an investigational modality only.""","""['Henk G van der Poel', 'Roderick C N van den Bergh', 'Erik Briers', 'Philip Cornford', 'Alex Govorov', 'Ann M Henry', 'Thomas B Lam', 'Malcolm D Mason', 'Olivier Rouvière', 'Maria De Santis', 'Peter-Paul M Willemse', 'Hendrik van Poppel', 'Nicolas Mottet']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Focal Therapy in Primary Localised Prostate Cancer: The European Association of Urology Position in 2018.', 'Re: Henk G. van der Poel, Roderick C.N. van den Bergh, Erik Briers, et al.

Prostate VMAT plans were created for the patients using the 6 MV photon beam produced by a Varian TrueBEAM linac with the calculation grid size equal to 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 mm. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of targets and organs at risk were generated for different grid sizes. We calculated the radiobiological parameters of the tumor control probability (TCP) of clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV), and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of organs at risk (rectal wall, rectum, bladder wall, bladder, left femur, and right femur). The homogeneity, conformity, and gradient indexes of CTV and PTV were calculated for different grid sizes. The TCP of PTV was found decreasing with a rate of 0.06%/mm when the calculation grid size increased from 1 to 5 mm. On the other hand, both NTCPs of rectal wall and rectum were found decreasing with rates of 0.03%/mm and 0.05%/mm, respectively, with an increase of grid size. The homogeneity index of PTV increased with a rate of 0.57/mm of the calculation grid size, whereas the conformity index of PTV decreased with a rate of 0.0075/mm. The gradient index of PTV was found increasing with a rate equal to 0.05/mm. In prostate VMAT planning, variations of dose-volume and radiobiological parameters with calculation grid size on PTV, rectal wall, and rectum were more significant than those of CTV and other organs at risk such as bladder wall, bladder, and femurs.

In this context, we have previously identified candidate genes that predict risk of late-occurring hematologic acute radiation syndrome (HARS) in a baboon model. The goal of the current study was to validate these genes after radiation exposure in humans. We also examined ex vivo relative to in vivo measurements in both species and describe dose-response relationships. Eighteen baboons were irradiated in vivo to simulate different patterns of partial- or total-body irradiation (TBI), corresponding to an equivalent dose of 2.5 or 5 Sv. Human in vivo blood samples were obtained from patients exposed to different dose ranges: diagnostic computerized tomography (CT; 0.004-0.018 Sv); radiotherapy for prostate cancer (0.25-0.3 Sv); and TBI of leukemia patients (2 × 1.5 or 2 × 2 Sv, five patients each). Peripheral whole blood of another five baboons and human samples from five healthy donors were cultivated ex vivo and irradiated with 0-4 Sv. RNA was isolated pairwise before and 24 h after irradiation and converted into cDNA. Gene expression of six promising candidate genes found previously by us in a baboon model ( WNT3, POU2AF1, CCR7, ARG2, CD177, WLS), as well as three genes commonly used in ex vivo whole blood experiments ( FDXR, PCNA, DDB2) was measured using qRT-PCR. We confirmed the six baboon candidate genes in leukemia patients. However, expression for the candidate gene FDXR showed an inverse relationship, as it was downregulated in baboons and upregulated in human samples. Comparisons among the in vivo and ex vivo experiments revealed the same pattern in both species and indicated peripheral blood cells to represent the radiation-responsive targets causing WNT3 and POU2AF1 gene expression changes. CCR7, ARG2, CD177 and WLS appeared to be altered due to radiation-responsive targets other than the whole blood cells. Linear dose-response relationships of FDXR, WNT3 and POU2AF1 using human ex vivo samples corresponded with human in vivo samples, suggesting that ex vivo models for in vivo dose estimates can be used over a wide dose range (0.001-5 Sv for POU2AF1). In summary, we validated six baboon candidate genes in humans, but the FDXR measurements underscored the importance of independent assessments even when candidates from animal models have striking gene sequence homology to humans. Since whole blood cells represented the same radiation-responsive targets for FDXR, WNT3 and POU2AF1 gene expression changes, ex vivo cell culture models can be utilized for in vivo dose estimates over a dose range covering up to 3.5 log scales. These findings might be a step forward in the development of a gene expression-based high-throughput diagnostic test for populations involved in large-scale radio/nuclear incidents.""","""['M Port', 'M Majewski', 'F Herodin', 'M Valente', 'M Drouet', 'F Forcheron', 'A Tichy', 'I Sirak', 'A Zavrelova', 'A Malkova', 'B V Becker', 'D A Veit', 'S Waldeck', 'C Badie', ""G O'Brien"", 'H Christiansen', 'J Wichmann', 'M Eder', 'G Beutel', 'J Vachelova', 'S Doucha-Senf', 'M Abend']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiat Res""","""['First Generation Gene Expression Signature for Early Prediction of Late Occurring Hematological Acute Radiation Syndrome in Baboons.', 'Four Genes Predictive for the Severity of Hematological Damage Reveal a Similar Response after X Irradiation and Chemotherapy.', 'Impact of Inter-Individual Variance in the Expression of a Radiation-Responsive Gene Panel Used for Triage.', 'Basis of radiation protection.', 'Gene Expression Changes in Irradiated Baboons: A Summary and Interpretation of a Decade of Findings.', 'The role of Evi/Wntless in exporting Wnt proteins.', 'Lung transcriptome of nonhuman primates exposed to total- and partial-body irradiation.', 'Transcriptional Dynamics of DNA Damage Responsive Genes in Circulating Leukocytes during Radiotherapy.', 'Identifying radiation responsive exon-regions of genes often used for biodosimetry and acute radiation syndrome prediction.', 'Development of Biomarkers for Radiation Biodosimetry and Medical Countermeasures Research: Current Status, Utility, and Regulatory Pathways.']"""

Materials and methods:   Patients diagnosed as prostate adenocarcinoma during 2004-2009 without any surgical treatment to the primary site were selected from the SEER registry. Excluded were cases with incomplete or unavailable staging, PSA and Gleason score information.  Results:   A total of 144,443 cases were identified. The median follow-up time was 84 months.

The optimal timing of postoperative radiotherapy is unclear.  Objective:   To compare the clinical outcomes of postoperative ART and ESRT administered to patients with prostate cancer with adverse pathological features.  Design, setting, and participants:   This multi-institutional, propensity score-matched cohort study involved 1566 consecutive patients who underwent postprostatectomy ART or ESRT at 10 US academic medical centers between January 1, 1987, and December 31, 2013. Propensity score 1-to-1 matching was used to account for covariates potentially associated with treatment selection. Data were collected from January 1 to September 30, 2016. Data analysis was conducted from October 1, 2016, to October 21, 2017.  Main outcomes and measures:   Freedom from postirradiation biochemical failure, freedom from distant metastases, and overall survival. All outcomes were measured from date of surgery to address lead-time bias.  Results:   Of 1566 patients, 1195 with prostate-specific antigen levels of 0.1 to 0.5 ng/mL received ESRT and 371 patients with prostate-specific antigen levels lower than 0.1 ng/mL received ART. The median age (interquartile range) was 60 (55-65) years. After propensity score matching, the median (interquartile range) follow-up after surgery was similar between the ESRT and ART groups (73.3 [44.9-106.6] months vs 65.8 [40-107] months; P = .22). Adjuvant RT, compared with ESRT, was associated with higher freedom from biochemical failure (12-year actuarial rates: 69% [95% CI, 60%-76%] vs 43% [95% CI, 35%-51%]; effect size, 26%), freedom from distant metastases (95% [95% CI, 90%-97%] vs 85% [95% CI, 76%-90%]; effect size, 10%), and overall survival (91% [95% CI, 84%-95%] vs 79% [95% CI, 69%-86%]; effect size, 12%). Adjuvant RT, lower Gleason score and T stage, nodal irradiation, and postoperative androgen deprivation therapy were favorable prognostic features on multivariate analysis for biochemical failure. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the decreased risk of biochemical failure associated with ART remained significant unless more than 56% of patients in the ART group were cured by surgery alone. This threshold is greater than the estimated 12-year freedom from biochemical failure rate of 33% to 52% after radical prostatectomy alone, as determined by a contemporary dynamic nomogram.  Conclusions and relevance:   Adjuvant RT, compared with ESRT, was associated with reduced biochemical recurrence, distant metastases, and death for high-risk patients, pending prospective validation. These findings suggest that a greater proportion of patients with prostate cancer who have adverse pathological features may benefit from postprostatectomy ART rather than surveillance followed by ESRT.""","""['William L Hwang', 'Rahul D Tendulkar', 'Andrzej Niemierko', 'Shree Agrawal', 'Kevin L Stephans', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Jason W Hearn', 'Bridget F Koontz', 'W Robert Lee', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'Thomas M Pisansky', 'Stanley L Liauw', 'Matthew C Abramowitz', 'Alan Pollack', 'Drew Moghanaki', 'Mitchell S Anscher', 'Robert B Den', 'Anthony L Zietman', 'Andrew J Stephenson', 'Jason A Efstathiou']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Data Presentation Error in Results Paragraph of Abstract.', 'Re: Comparison between Adjuvant and Early-Salvage Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer with Adverse Pathological Features.', 'Comparing Adjuvant vs Early-Salvage Radiotherapy After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Comparing Adjuvant vs Early-Salvage Radiotherapy After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Comparing Adjuvant vs Early-Salvage Radiotherapy After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Comparing Adjuvant vs Early-Salvage Radiotherapy After Radical Prostatectomy-Reply.', 'Postoperative Radiation Therapy in Localized Prostate Cancer: When, How Much, and How Fast?', 'Long-term results of adjuvant versus early salvage postprostatectomy radiation: A large single-institutional experience.', 'Long-term Impact of Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in pT3N0 Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Multi-institutional Series.', 'Early salvage radiation therapy does not compromise cancer control in patients with pT3N0 prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: results of a match-controlled multi-institutional analysis.', 'Adjuvant versus early Salvage radiation therapy for prostate cancer with adverse pathological features on radical prostatectomy-Do we finally have an answer?', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'What benefit can be obtained from magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis with artificial intelligence in prostate cancer compared with clinical assessments?', 'MRI-derived tumor volume as a predictor of biochemical recurrence and adverse pathology in patients after radical prostatectomy: a propensity score matching study.', 'Phase II Randomized Study of Salvage Radiation Therapy Plus Enzalutamide or Placebo for High-Risk Prostate-Specific Antigen Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: The SALV-ENZA Trial.', 'The Effect of Adverse Surgical Margins on the Risk of Biochemical Recurrence after Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The Risk of Heart Disease-Related Death Among Anaplastic Astrocytoma Patients After Chemotherapy: A SEER Population-Based Analysis.']"""

The number of deaths and years of life lost (YLL) due to a disease can be used to monitor health status, assess healthcare needs and determine the prioritisation and allocation of health resources within a population; in addition, the latter calculation can serve as a baseline indicator of premature mortality. This study aimed to measure prostate cancer-related mortality and YLL in Yazd Province, Iran.  Methods:   This study included all prostate cancer-related deaths in Yazd Province reported between March 2001 and March 2010. Mortality data were obtained from a provincial death registration system which integrates data from different sources. YLL was calculated based on an individual's age at death and their life expectancy according to age group.  Results:   During the study period, prostate cancer was the fourth most common fatal cancer among men, resulting in 324 deaths or 10.0% of all cancer-related deaths. The crude mortality rate per 100,000 individuals increased from 4.7 in 2001 to 8.8 in 2010. Premature deaths caused 1,358.7 YLL and the YLL caused by prostate cancer deaths more than doubled from 94.7 in 2001 to 196.5 in 2010.  Conclusion:   Due to changes in population structure, it is likely that the burden of prostate cancer will continue to increase in Yazd Province. As such, it is necessary that the national health system implements screening programmes and improves public awareness of prostate cancer-associated risk factors.""","""['Mojtaba Mirzaei', 'Mahboobehsadat Mirzadeh', 'Mohsen Mirzaei']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J""","""['Expected Years of Life Lost Due to Adult Cancer Mortality in Yazd ( 2004-2010 ).', 'Years of Life Lost Due to Main Causes of Deaths in Yazd Province, Iran.', 'Years of life lost (YLL) associated with COVID-19 deaths in Khorasan-RAZAVI province, Iran.', 'Years of Life Lost and Childhood and Adolescent Cancer Mortality in Yazd Province, Iran (2004-2009).', 'Trends in Road Traffic Deaths in Yazd, Iran, 2004 - 2010.', 'Mortality Rate and Years of Life Lost due to Hypertension in the South of Iran between 2004 and 2019: A Population-Based Study.', 'Years of life lost due to asthma in a population-based 10-year study in Yazd, Iran.', 'HoxB13 mediates AR-V7 activity in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods: Twenty-one patients with known metastatic disease were staged with both conventional bone scanning and PSMA ligand scintigraphy within a time frame of less than 10 d. Imaging included planar whole-body scanning and SPECT or SPECT/CT with 2 bed positions 3 h after injection of either 500-750 MBq of 99mTc-MIP-1427 or 600-750 MBq of 99mTc-MDP. Lesions were scored as typical tumor, equivocal (benign/malignant), or normal within a standard reporting schema divided into defined anatomic regions. Masked and consensus readings were performed with sequential unmasking: planar scans first, then SPECT/CT, the best evaluable comparator (including MRI), PET/CT, and follow-up examinations. Results: Eleven patients had PSMA-positive visceral metastases that were predictably not diagnosed with conventional bone scanning. However, SPECT/CT was required to distinguish between soft-tissue uptake and overlapping bone. Four patients had extensive 99mTc-MDP-negative bone marrow lesions. Seven patients had superscan characteristics on bone scans; in contrast, the extent of red marrow involvement was more evident on PSMA scans. Only 3 patients had equivalent results on bone scans and PSMA scans. In 16 patients, more suspect lesions were detected with PSMA scanning than with bone scanning. In 2 patients (10%), a PSMA-negative tumor phenotype was present. Conclusion: PSMA scanning provided a clear advantage over bone scanning by reducing the number of equivocal findings in most patients. SPECT/CT was pivotal for differentiating bone metastases from extraosseous tumor lesions.""","""['Hendrik Rathke', 'Ali Afshar-Oromieh', 'Frederik Lars Giesel', 'Christophe Kremer', 'Paul Flechsig', 'Sabine Haufe', 'Walter Mier', 'Tim Holland-Letz', 'Maximilian De Bucourt', 'Thomas Armor', 'John W Babich', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Clemens Kratochwil']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Head-to-head comparison of 99mTc-PSMA and 99mTc-MDP SPECT/CT in diagnosing prostate cancer bone metastasis: a prospective, comparative imaging trial.', 'PSMA SPECT/CT with 99mTc-MIP-1404 in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: predictive factors and efficacy for the detection of PSMA-positive lesions at low and very-low PSA levels.', 'Comparison of Bone Uptake in Bone Scan and Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT Images in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Head-To-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy for the Detection of Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', '18F-NaF-PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy in the Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer.', 'Head-to-head comparison of 99mTc-PSMA and 99mTc-MDP SPECT/CT in diagnosing prostate cancer bone metastasis: a prospective, comparative imaging trial.', 'Planar 99m Tc-PSMA Imaging of Prostate Cancer in a Low-Resource Setting: A Series Report.', '99mTc-PSMA Left Behind: a Call for Collaboration.', 'Advances in PSMA theranostics.', 'A Review on the Current State and Future Perspectives of 99mTcTc-Housed PSMA-i in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods: Four hundred seven patients who underwent Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys radiolabeled with 68Ga-gallium N,N-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]ethylenediamine-N,N-diacetic acid (68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC) PET (combined with a diagnostic CT) were retrospectively analyzed. The number of 68Ga-PSMA PET-positive cervical, celiac, and sacral ganglia was determined, and the configuration and SUVmax of each ganglion were measured. In addition, the configuration and SUVmax of adjacent lymph node metastases in the respective region (cervical, celiac, or sacral) were determined. Results:68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake above background was detected in 401 (98.5%) patients in any peripheral ganglia, in 369 (92%) patients in cervical ganglia, in 363 (89%) patients in celiac ganglia, and in 183 (46%) patients in sacral ganglia. The 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake was highest in celiac (mean SUVmax, 2.9 ± 0.8 vs. cervical mean SUVmax, 2.4 ± 0.6) and sacral (mean SUVmax 1.7 ± 0.5; both P < 0.0001) ganglia. Intraindividually there was a statistically significant but weak to moderate correlation between the 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake in cervical versus celiac ganglia (R = 0.34, P < 0.0001), cervical versus sacral (R = 0.52, P < 0.0001), and celiac versus sacral (R = 0.16, P < 0.05). The 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake was significantly more intense in adjacent lymph node metastases than the respective ganglia (cervical: 18.0 ± 16.2 vs. 2.4 ± 0.6, P < 0.0001; celiac: 13.5 ± 12.3 vs. 2.9 ± 0.8, P < 0.0001; sacral: 13.4 ± 11.6 vs. 1.7 ± 0.5, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, ganglia predominantly exhibit a band-shaped configuration (71.2%), followed by a teardrop (26.8%) and only rarely a nodular configuration (2.0%). Conversely, lymph node metastases are only rarely band-shaped (1.1%), but more often show teardrop (40.3%) or nodular appearance (58.6%) (P < 0.00001). Conclusion:68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake in ganglia along the sympathetic trunk as assessed by 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET represents an important pitfall in prostate cancer PET imaging. The 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake is higher in celiac ganglia than cervical or sacral ganglia, and the level of 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake seems to be patient-related. For the differentiation between lymph node metastases and sympathetic ganglia, both intensity of 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake and exact localization and configuration of the respective lesion should be examined carefully.""","""['Christoph Rischpler', 'Teresa I Beck', 'Shozo Okamoto', 'Anna M Schlitter', 'Karina Knorr', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Jürgen Gschwend', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Philipp T Meyer', 'Matthias Eiber']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Quantitative Test-Retest Measurement of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC in Tumor and Normal Tissue.', 'Value of 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET for the Assessment of Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence: Comparison with Histopathology After Salvage Lymphadenectomy.', '(68)GaPSMA-HBED uptake mimicking lymph node metastasis in coeliac ganglia: an important pitfall in clinical practice.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Can Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT replace conventional imaging modalities for primary lymph node and bone staging of prostate cancer?', 'Novel radionuclide therapy combinations in prostate cancer.', 'The diagnosis and treatment of castrate-sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer: A review.', 'New perspectives on metabolic imaging in the management of prostate cancer in 2022: A focus on radiolabeled PSMA‑PET/CT (Review).', 'Identification of incidental brain tumors in prostate cancer patients via PSMA PET/CT.', 'Imaging quality of an artificial intelligence denoising algorithm: validation in 68Ga PSMA-11 PET for patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.']"""

Design:   Observational cohort study.  Setting:   Primary care.  Participants:   A total of 52 044 patients with T2D who participated in the ZODIAC (Zwolle Outpatient Diabetes project Integrating Available Care) study between 1998 and 2012 was included (49% women). A dataset of these patients was linked to available information of the Netherlands Cancer Registry to obtain data on cancer incidents.  Primary outcome measures:   Analyses were performed for the total group of obesity-related cancers and for non-sex-specific and sex-specific obesity-related cancers (in men: advanced prostate cancer, in women: ovarian, endometrial and postmenopausal breast cancer).  Results:   The median follow-up period in all analyses was 3.1 (1.7-5.0) years in men and 3.1 (1.7-5.1) in women. During follow-up, 689 men and 914 women were diagnosed with an obesity-related cancer. In men, BMI was associated with a higher risk of the total group of obesity-related cancers and non-sex-specific obesity-related cancers (HR (per 5 kg/m2 increase) 1.12 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.23) and HR 1.18 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.31)). No association was found with prostate cancer. In women, an association between BMI and all obesity-related cancers combined and sex-specific obesity-related cancers was present (HR 1.15 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.22) and HR 1.22 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.32)). No association with non-sex-specific cancers was found in women.  Conclusions:   BMI is associated with obesity-related cancers in men with T2D, except with advanced prostate cancer.

However, the effects of lead time and overdiagnosis can inflate survival even without real screening benefit.  Methods:   A simulation model of PCS in the early PSA era (1991-2000) was created. The modeled survival started with baseline survival in the pre-PSA era (1975-1990) and added lead times and overdiagnosis using estimates from published studies. The authors quantified 1) discrepancies between modeled and observed PCS in the PSA era and 2) residual period effects on PCS given specified values for screening benefit.  Results:   Lead time and overdiagnosis explained more of the improvement in PCS for older ages at diagnosis (46% [95% confidence interval (CI), 44%-50%] for blacks and 51% [95% CI, 50%-52%] for all races ages 50-54 years vs 98% [95% CI, 97%-99%] for blacks and 100% for all races ages 75-79 years). They also explained more of the narrowing in PCS disparities for older ages (33% [95% CI, 31%-43%] for men ages 50-54 years vs 74% [95% CI, 71%-81%] for men ages 75-79 years). The period effects amounted to reductions of 27% to 40% among blacks and 26% to 38% among all races in the risk of prostate cancer death, depending on the screening benefit.  Conclusions:   Real improvements in survival disparities in the PSA era are smaller than those observed and reflect similar reductions in the risk of prostate cancer death among blacks and all races.

To the authors' knowledge, it remains unclear whether patients of Hispanic ethnicity have better or worse survival outcomes. In the current study, the authors evaluated whether Hispanic participants in SWOG clinical trials had different survival outcomes compared with non-Hispanics.  Methods:   Adult patients registered in SWOG phase 2/3 clinical trials between 1986 and 2012 were analyzed. Studies of similar histology and stage of disease were combined. Within each analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated to examine differences in outcome by ethnicity. Multivariate Cox regression was used to estimate the association between ethnicity and survival outcomes, controlling for major disease-specific prognostic factors and demographic variables plus area-level income and education to account for socioeconomic status.  Results:   A total of 29,338 patients registered to 38 trials were included; 5% of these patients were Hispanic. Hispanic patients were more likely to be younger and from areas of lower income and education (all P<.05). No differences in survival were observed across tumor types except in the patients with advanced stage prostate cancer, in whom the authors observed an association between Hispanic ethnicity and worse overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; P = .006), progression-free survival (HR, 1.36; P = .007), and cancer-specific survival (HR, 1.42; P = .013).

In the general population, women have a lower risk for obesity-related cancer compared to men. Previous studies involving cardiovascular disease have shown that T2DM eliminates a female advantage of lower CVD risk in the general population compared to men. It is unclear whether the same could be true for obesity-related cancer. This study aimed to this investigate obesity-related cancer incidence in women and men known with T2DM as compared to the Dutch general population.  Methods:   This study included 69,583 patients with T2DM selected from a prospective primary care cohort, which was linked to the Dutch National Cancer Registry to obtain cancer specific data. Obesity-related cancers included liver, kidney, colorectal, gallbladder, pancreas, ovarian, endometrial, advanced prostate cancer, post-menopausal breast cancer and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Primary outcome was sex-stratified, age and year of cancer diagnosis adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for three time periods: 5 years before, the year after diagnosis and the next 4 years after T2DM diagnosis. The Dutch general population was used as reference group.  Results:   Women with T2DM were at an increased risk for obesity-related cancer compared to women in the general population already 5 years before diabetes diagnosis (SIR 1.77; 95%CI: 1.63-1.91). In both men and women, there was a peak in obesity-related cancer incidence following diabetes diagnosis (SIR: 1.38; 95%CI 1.11-1.64 and SIR: 2.21; 95%CI 1.94-2.30, respectively). From the second to the fifth year after diabetes diagnosis the obesity-related cancer incidence was higher in women compared to women in the general population (SIR: 2.12; 95%CI 1.94-2.30).  Conclusions:   Women with T2DM seem to have a substantially higher obesity-related cancer risk. As opposed to men, in women this risk was already increased years before diabetes diagnosis. These results could imply that a relative advantage of women in the general population with regard to cancer risk is lost in women with T2DM.""","""['Dennis Schrijnders', 'Steven H Hendriks', 'Nanne Kleefstra', 'Pauline A J Vissers', 'Jeffrey A Johnson', 'Geertruida H de Bock', 'Henk J G Bilo', 'Gijs W D Landman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Association between body mass index and obesity-related cancer risk in men and women with type 2 diabetes in primary care in the Netherlands: a cohort study (ZODIAC-56).', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Diabetes mellitus type 2 and subsite-specific colorectal cancer risk in men and women: results from the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer.', 'Type 2 diabetes and gender differences in liver cancer by considering different confounding factors: a meta-analysis of cohort studies.', 'Gender Differences in Obesity-Related Cancers.', 'Role of Serum Lipids, Blood Glucose and Blood Pressure in Breast Cancer Risk for Women with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.', 'Are the factors associated with overweight/general obesity and abdominal obesity different depending on menopausal status?', 'Activation of cancer-related and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in human mature osteoblasts isolated from patients with type 2 diabetes.']"""

Similar to other types of cancers, early diagnosis of thyroid cancer is important to increase the survival and treatment of this disease. Several immunohistochemical markers are used in the differential diagnosis of thyroid papillary carcinoma. Also, increasing evidence indicates that P-element induced wimpy testis like 2 (PIWIL2) is an RNA-binding protein involved in the induction and progression of numerous types of human malignancies such as lung, breast, colon, prostate and cervix cancers. However, the role of PIWIL2 was poorly investigated in thyroid cancers. Accordingly, aim of the present study was to elucidate the relationship between PIWIL2 and thyroid cancers. The expression level of PIWIL2 was determined by analyzing both protein and mRNA levels in papillary and micropapillary carcinoma tissues by using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR methods, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis of HBME-1, galectin-3 and CK-19 was also performed. Similar to other immune markers of HBME-1, galectin-3 and CK-19, protein expression levels of PIWIL2 was significantly up-regulated in both papillary and micropapillary thyroid cancers (p < 0.01). Moreover, consistent with protein expression levels, mRNA expression levels of PIWIL2 was elevated in both papillary and micropapillary thyroid cancer tissues. Yet, mRNA expression changes were statistically insignificant. In conclusion, results of the current study suggest that PIWIL2 can be involved in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis and can be used as a novel predictive biomarker and/or therapeutic target.""","""['Ibrahim Halil Erdogdu', 'Onder Yumrutas', 'M Ozgur Cevik', 'Ibrahim Bozgeyik', 'Miyase Erdogdu', 'Hacı Mehmet Inan', 'Haydar Bagis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Combined staining for immunohistochemical markers in the diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma: improvement in the sensitivity or specificity?', 'Galectin-1 is a diagnostic marker involved in thyroid cancer progression.', 'Role of cd56 and e-cadherin expression in the differential diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma and suspected follicular-patterned lesions of the thyroid: the prognostic importance of e-cadherin.', 'Expression of CK-19, galectin-3 and HBME-1 in the differentiation of thyroid lesions: systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis.', 'Prognostic biomarkers in thyroid cancer.', 'Potential roles of PIWI-interacting RNAs in lung cancer.', 'Novel piRNA MW557525 regulates the growth of Piwil2-iCSCs and maintains their stem cell pluripotency.', 'Ku80 gene knockdown by the CRISPR/Cas9 technique affects the biological functions of human thyroid carcinoma cells.', 'Cancer stem-like cell-derived exosomes promotes the proliferation and invasion of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells.']"""

The accuracy of this system at five sites was evaluated with clinical data from cancer patients. The dependence of calculation accuracy on the size of the region of interest (ROI) and initial position was evaluated for clinical use.  Methods:   For a preliminary verification, treatment planning and positioning data from eight setup patterns using a head and neck phantom were evaluated. Following this, data from 50 patients with prostate, lung, head and neck, liver, or pancreatic cancer (n = 10 each) were evaluated. Root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the results calculated by our system and the reference positions were assessed. The reference positions were manually determined by two radiological technologists to best-matching positions with orthogonal DRs and DRRs in six axial directions. The ROI size dependence was evaluated by comparing RMSEs for three different ROI sizes. Additionally, dependence on initial position parameters was evaluated by comparing RMSEs for four position patterns.  Results:   For the phantom study, the average (± standard deviation) translation error was 0.17 ± 0.05, rotation error was 0.17 ± 0.07, and ΔD was 0.14 ± 0.05. Using the optimal ROI size for each patient site, all cases of prostate, lung, and head and neck cancer with initial position parameters of 10 mm or under were acceptable in our tolerance. However, only four liver cancer cases and three pancreatic cancer cases were acceptable, because of low-reproducibility regions in the ROIs.

The present study investigated the effects of curcumin on the inhibition of intracrine androgen synthesis in prostate cancer. Human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells were incubated with or without curcumin after which cell proliferation was measured at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively. Prostate tissues from the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model were obtained after 1-month oral administration of 200 mg/kg/d curcumin. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations in LNCaP prostate cancer cells were determined through LC-MS/MS assay. Curcumin inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Curcumin decreased the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory proteins, CYP11A1 and HSD3B2 in prostate cancer cell lines, supporting the decrease of testosterone production. After 1-month oral administration of curcumin, Aldo-Keto reductase 1C2 (AKR1C2) expression was elevated. Simultaneously, decreased testosterone levels in the prostate tissues were observed in the TRAMP mice. Meanwhile, curcumin treatments considerably increased the expression of AKR1C2 in prostate cancer cell lines, supporting the decrease of dihydrotestosterone. Taken together, these results suggest that curcumin's natural bioactive compounds could have potent anticancer properties due to suppression of androgen production, and this could have therapeutic effects on prostate cancer.""","""['Hisamitsu Ide', 'Yan Lu', 'Takahiro Noguchi', 'Satoru Muto', 'Hiroshi Okada', 'Suguru Kawato', 'Shigeo Horie']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Human type 3 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (aldo-keto reductase 1C2) and androgen metabolism in prostate cells.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen synthesis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Role of human type 3 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C2) in androgen metabolism of prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of the molecular switch that regulates access of 5alpha-DHT to the androgen receptor.', 'Classical and Non-Classical Roles for Pre-Receptor Control of DHT Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Curcumin-zinc framework encapsulated microneedle patch for promoting hair growth.', 'Pharmacological Mechanisms and Clinical Applications of Curcumin: Update.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Phenolic Compounds in Medicinal Plants-Natural Health Products for Human Health.', 'Comprehensive analysis regarding the prognostic significance of downregulated ferroptosis-related gene AKR1C2 in gastric cancer and its underlying roles in immune response.', 'Establishment of a novel prognostic prediction model through bioinformatics analysis for prostate cancer based on ferroptosis-related genes and its application in immune cell infiltration.']"""

Methods:   Forced expression of p62 in PC-3 cells and normal prostate epithelial cells, RWPE-1 and PZ-HPV7, were carried out by transfection of these cells with pcDNA3.1/p62 or p62 shRNA plasmid. Autophagosomes and autophagic flux were measured by transfection of tandem fluorescence protein mCherry-GFP-LC3 construct. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V/PI staining. Tumorigenesis was measured by a xenograft tumor growth model.  Results:   Verteporfin inhibited cell growth and colony formation in PC-3 cells. Verteporfin generated crosslinked p62 oligomers, resulting in inhibition of autophagy and constitutive activation of Nrf2 as well as its target genes, Bcl-2 and TNF-α. In normal prostate epithelial cells, forced expression of p62 caused constitutive Nrf2 activation, development of apoptosis resistance, and Verteporfin treatment exhibited inhibitory effects. Verteporfin treatment also inhibited starvation-induced autophagic flux of these cells. Verteporfin inhibited tumorigenesis of both normal prostate epithelial cells with p62 expression and prostate cancer cells and decreased p62, constitutive Nrf2, and Bcl-xL in xenograft tumor tissues, indicating that p62 can be developed as a drug target against prostate cancer.

Pre-operatively, all patients received transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies according to inhomogeneous templates chosen by the referring urologist. We evaluated the outcomes according to a stratified group-analysis: Group 1 received less than 12 biopsies, Group 2 received more than 12 biopsies, and Group 3 received exactly 12 biopsies, according to the EAU Guidelines template.

We aimed to define pathological and clinical characteristics associated with germline DNA-repair gene mutations, to facilitate selection of patients for germline testing.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 150 unselected patients with recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer who were offered germline genetic testing by a single oncologist using a clinical-grade assay (Color Genomics). This platform utilizes next-generation sequencing from saliva to interrogate 30 cancer-susceptibility genes. Presence or absence of a deleterious germline mutation was correlated with histological and clinical characteristics, and with family history of cancer. All patients with DNA-sequence alterations (pathogenic or variants) were offered genetic counseling.  Results:   Between July 2016 and July 2017, 150 consecutive patients underwent germline testing; pathogenic mutations were identified in 21 men (14%). Among those with germline mutations, 9 (43%) were in BRCA2, 3 (14%) were in ATM, 3 (14%) were in CHEK2, and 2 (9%) were in BRCA1. While there were no associations between germline mutations and age, tumor stage, Gleason sum or family history; mutation-positive patients had lower median PSA levels at diagnosis (5.5 vs 8.6 ng/mL, P = 0.01) and unique pathologic features. Namely, men with germline mutations were more likely to harbor intraductal/ductal histology (48% vs 12%, P < 0.01) and lymphovascular invasion (52% vs 14%, P < 0.01). Finally, 44% of patients with a positive germline test would not have been offered genetic screening according to current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.  Conclusions:   Presence of intraductal/ductal histology and lymphovascular invasion appear to be associated with pathogenic germline DNA-repair gene mutations in men with prostate cancer, and identification of these features may help to select patients for germline testing.

The median follow-up was 50 months (range 6-164 months). (Results) We identified IDC-P in 112 cases (25.4%).

Detailed examination led to a diagnosis of bilateral ureteral cancer and prostate cancer. Total nephroureterectomy was performed for bilateral ureteral cancers on separate occasions, while prostate cancer was managed with hormone therapy. Because multiple bladder tumors were found by cystoscopy conducted after 3 months, total cystectomy was performed. Neither distant metastasis nor local recurrence had developed, 2 years later, when the patient visited our department again because of glans enlargement and received a diagnosis of penile cancer. Partial penectomy was performed, and a 1-cm indurated nodule was found in the skin of the hypogastric region during surgery and treated by simultaneous wedge-shaped excision. Histopathologically, the lesions were urothelial carcinomas. Multiple metastatic foci occurred in the skin postoperatively centering on the hypogastric region, growing rapidly and accompanied by bleeding and exudate causing a bad odor. Topical application of Mohs paste resulted in dramatic improvement of the pain and exudate, which thereby improved the patient's quality of life (QOL) to a level enabling discontinuation of narcotic drug therapy for cancer-related pain. Thereafter, hepatic metastasis was found and chemotherapy with gemcitabine and paclitaxel was administered. The patient did not respond to this chemotherapy and died of cancer 3 months later. Cutaneous metastasis of urothelial carcinoma, which is a very rare condition, is often managed with palliative therapy due to the lack of response to anticancer chemotherapy. In such cases, the use of Mohs paste appears to be of great value for maintaining the patient's QOL which otherwise might deteriorate markedly.""","""['Hiroshi Masumoto', 'Seiji Fujiwara']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi""","""[""Clinical usefulness of Mohs' chemosurgery for palliative purposes in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma with risk factors or without indication for surgery: three case reports."", 'Port-site metastasis after retroperitoneoscopy-assisted nephroureterectomy and cystectomy for bladder cancer invading the ureter: a case report.', 'Clinical diagnosis and treatment of spontaneous urinary extravasation caused by primary lower ureteral tumor.', 'Intravesical Recurrence of Small Cell Carcinoma of the Ureter: A Case Report.', 'A case of vaginal metastasis of transitional cell carcinoma.']"""

However, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is a less invasive procedure than conventional surgery. Therefore, we perform RARP for elderly patients whose general condition is good (Performance status ≤1). The aim of this study is to evaluate surgical, oncological and functional outcomes for RARP in men age 75 and older. (Patients and methods) From July 2013 to April 2016, 300 patients underwent RARP at our institution. They were divided into two groups: an older patient group (≥75 years) and a younger patient group (<75 years). Treatment outcomes for each group, including surgical, oncological and functional outcomes, were compared. (Results) There were no statistically significant differences in surgical outcomes with the exception of nerve sparing rates (older patients: 5.9% vs. younger patients: 17.7%, P=0.0192). Importantly, intra- and postoperative complication rates were similar in both groups (minor complication: 7.4% vs. 3.9%, P=0.322, major complication: 0.0% vs. 2.2%, P=0.592). Regarding oncological outcomes, including positive surgical margin rate and PSA failure (PSA>0.2 ng/ml) at 12 months after surgery, no significant differences existed. Lastly, functional outcomes between the groups, including continence (≤1 pads/day) at 12 months after surgery, had no significant differences.

Recent studies showed that miR-376c regulates UGT2B15 in prostate cancer cells via a canonical target site in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The UGT2B15 3'UTR also contains a canonical miR-331-5p target site; previous work indicated that deleting this site reduced, but did not abolish, the ability of miR-331-5p to repress a luciferase reporter carrying the UGT2B15 3'UTR We report here the discovery and characterization of a second, noncanonical miR-331-5p target site in the UGT2B15 3'UTR miR-331-5p-mediated repression of a UGT2B15 3'UTR-reporter was partly inhibited by mutating either of the two miR-331-5p target sites separately, but completely abolished by mutating the two sites simultaneously, indicating that the two sites act cooperatively. miR-331-5p mimics significantly reduced both UGT2B15 mRNA levels and glucuronidation activity in prostate cancer cells, confirming that the native transcript is a miR-331-5p target. Transfection of either miR-331-5p or miR-376c mimics repressed the activity of the UGT2B15 3'UTR-reporter; however, cotransfection of both microRNAs (miRNAs) further reduced activity, indicating cooperative regulation by these two miRNAs. A significant negative correlation between miR-331 and UGT2B15 mRNA levels was observed in a tissue RNA panel, and analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) hepatocellular carcinoma data set provided further evidence that miR-331 may play an important role in regulation of UGT2B15 in vivo. There was no significant correlation between miR-331 and UGT2B15 mRNA levels in the TCGA prostate adenocarcinoma cohort, which may reflect the complexity of androgen-mediated regulation in determining UGT2B15 levels in prostate cancer. Finally, we show that miR-331-5p does not regulate UGT2B17, providing the first evidence for a post-transcriptional mechanism that differentially regulates these two important androgen-metabolizing UGTs.""","""['Dhilushi D Wijayakumara', 'Peter I Mackenzie', 'Ross A McKinnon', 'Dong Gui Hu', 'Robyn Meech']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Regulation of Human UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 by miR-376c in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Epigenetic regulation of steroid inactivating UDP-glucuronosyltransferases by microRNAs in prostate cancer.', ""Identification and validation of the microRNA response elements in the 3'-untranslated region of the UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 and 2B15 genes by a functional genomics approach."", 'Multiple roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)2B15 and UGT2B17 enzymes in androgen metabolism and prostate cancer evolution.', 'Regulation of human UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) genes by miRNAs.', 'Long non-coding RNA anti-differentiation non-coding RNA affects proliferation, invasion, and migration of breast cancer cells by targeting miR-331.', 'Coordinated Regulation of UGT2B15 Expression by Long Noncoding RNA LINC00574 and hsa-miR-129-5p in HepaRG Cells.', 'Sweet Control: MicroRNA Regulation of the Glycome.', 'MicroRNAs hsa-miR-495-3p and hsa-miR-486-5p suppress basal and rifampicin-induced expression of human sulfotransferase 2A1 (SULT2A1) by facilitating mRNA degradation.']"""

We randomized 202 patients with treatment-naïve mCRPC to abiraterone or enzalutamide and performed whole-exome and deep targeted 72-gene sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA prior to therapy. For these agents, which have never been directly compared, time to progression was similar. Defects in BRCA2 and ATM were strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes independently of clinical prognostic factors and circulating tumor DNA abundance. Somatic alterations in TP53, previously linked to reduced tumor dependency on AR signaling, were also independently associated with rapid resistance. Although detection of AR amplifications did not outperform standard prognostic biomarkers, AR gene structural rearrangements truncating the ligand binding domain were identified in several patients with primary resistance. These findings establish genomic drivers of resistance to first-line AR-directed therapy in mCRPC and identify potential minimally invasive biomarkers.Significance: Leveraging plasma specimens collected in a large randomized phase II trial, we report the relative impact of common circulating tumor DNA alterations on patient response to the most widely used therapies for advanced prostate cancer.

Contemporary rates of aRP are unknown in North America.  Objective:   To examine the rate of aRP and its effect on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in contemporary North American patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2014), we identified 3719 pN1 PCa patients.  Intervention:   RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Incidence proportion and median survival of LN metastatic PCa patients who underwent aRP versus completed RP (cRP). Cumulative incidence plots and competing-risks regression (CRR) models tested CSM and other-cause mortality rates according to aRP versus cRP. The effect of selected variables on CSM rate was graphically depicted using LOESS methodology. All analyses were repeated after propensity score matching.  Results and limitations:   Between 2004 and 2014, the rate of aRP decreased from 20.4% to 5.6% (p<0.001). Ten-year CSM rates were significantly higher after aRP (38.9% vs 21.6%) versus cRP (p<0.001). In multivariable CRR models, aRP yielded higher CSM (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.99) than cRP. A higher 5-yr CSM rate was recorded after aRP through the entire range of baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values and in patients with up to nine LN metastases. After propensity score matching, aRP resulted in overall higher CSM (HR: 1.72). Higher CSM was recorded after aRP for PSA values up to 50ng/ml and in patients with up to seven LN metastases. Results were limited by a selection bias that applies to aRP patients.  Conclusions:   Of contemporary North American patients, 5% are affected by aRP. It confers a significant survival disadvantage that applies to patients with baseline PSA values up to 50ng/ml and in those with up to seven LN metastases.

Objective:   To evaluate predictors for the level of self-assessed QoL at 3 mo, 12 mo, and 24 mo after robot-assisted laparoscopic (RALP) and open radical prostatectomy (ORP).  Design, setting, and participants:   The LAParoscopic Prostatectomy Robot Open study, a prospective, controlled, nonrandomised trial of more than 4000 men who underwent radical prostatectomy at 14 centres. Here we report on QoL issues after RALP and ORP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was self-assessed QoL preoperatively and at 3 mo, 12 mo, and 24 mo postoperatively. A direct validated question of self-assessed QoL on a seven-digit visual scale was used. Differences in QoL were analysed using logistic regression, with adjustment for confounders.  Results and limitations:   QoL did not differ between RALP and ORP postoperatively. Men undergoing ORP had a preoperatively significantly lower level of self-assessed QoL in a multivariable analysis compared with men undergoing RALP (odds ratio: 1.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-1.43), that disappeared when adjusted for preoperative preparedness for incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and certainty of being cured (odds ratio: 1.18, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-1.40). Incontinence and erectile dysfunction increased the risk for poor QoL at 3 mo, 12 mo, and 24 mo postoperatively. Biochemical recurrence did not affect QoL. A limitation of the study is the nonrandomised design.  Conclusions:   QoL at 3 mo, 12 mo, and 24 mo after RALP or ORP did not differ significantly between the two techniques. Poor QoL was associated with postoperative incontinence and erectile dysfunction but not with early cancer relapse, which was related to thoughts of death and waking up at night with worry.

We investigated whether body composition parameters could predict radiographic progression-free and cancer specific survival in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   In this multicenter retrospective study we evaluated data on 282 consecutive patients diagnosed with castration resistant prostate cancer between September 2009 and March 2017. The subcutaneous fat index, the visceral fat index and the skeletal muscle index at the diagnosis of castration resistant prostate cancer were determined by computerized tomography data. Survival analyses were performed using the subcutaneous fat, visceral fat and skeletal muscle indexes dichotomized at 39.9, 58 and 52.4 cm2/m2, respectively.  Results:   At the diagnosis of castration resistant prostate cancer, cancer specific survival was independently predicted using prostate specific antigen levels, Gleason score 8 or greater, performance status, a shorter interval from androgen deprivation therapy to castration resistant prostate cancer and a subcutaneous fat index of less than 39.9 cm2/m2. During the median followup of 16.0 months patients with a subcutaneous fat index of 39.9 cm2/m2 or greater received more docetaxel cycles than patients with a subcutaneous fat index of less than 39.9 cm2/m2. Compared to patients with a subcutaneous fat index of less than 39.9 cm2/m2 those with an index of 39.9 cm2/m2 or greater had better 1-year progression-free and 2-year cancer specific survival (p = 0.009 and 0.021, respectively).  Conclusions:   Patients with a subcutaneous fat index of 39.9 cm2/m2 or greater at the diagnosis of castration resistant prostate cancer showed higher progression-free and cancer specific survival rates than those with a subcutaneous fat index of less 39.9 cm2/m2 at diagnosis.

Materials and methods:   We evaluated the circulating AR gene copy number (CN) gain using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction in 21 control and 91 prostate cancer serum samples and its prognostic and therapeutic implications in prostate cancer.  Results:   In CRPC, AR CN gain was associated with faster progression to CRPC (P = .026), a greater number of previous treatments (P = .045), and previous chemotherapy (P = .016). Comparing patients with and without CN gain, the median progression-free survival (PFS) in the abiraterone subgroup was 1.7 months versus not reached (P = .004), and the median overall survival (OS) was 7 months versus 20.9 months (P = .020). In the enzalutamide subgroup, PFS was 1.7 versus 10.8 months (P = .006), and OS was 6.1 versus 16.5 months (P = .042). In the taxane subgroup, PFS was 3.2 versus 6.5 months (P = .093), and OS was 3.9 months versus not reached (P = .026). The presence of more AR copies correlated with shorter androgen deprivation (P = .002), abiraterone (P = .022), enzalutamide (P = .008), and taxane (P = .039) therapy.

Our previous report indicated that bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) induced CRPC via tumour-infiltrating macrophages. In a separate line of study, we have observed that the WNT5A/BMP6 loop in CaP bone metastasis mediates resistance to androgen deprivation in tissue culture. Simultaneously, we have reported that BMP6 induced castration resistance in CaP cells via tumour-infiltrating macrophages. Therefore, our present study aims to investigate the mechanism of WNT5A and its interaction with macrophages on CRPC.  Methods:   Doxycycline inducible WNT5A overexpression prostate cancer cell line was used for detailed mechanical study.  Results:   WNT5A was associated with increased expression of chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) in the human CaP cell line, LNCaP. Mechanistically, this induction of CCL2 by WNT5A is likely to be mediated via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathway. Our in vivo experiments demonstrated that the overexpression of WNT5A in LNCaP cells promoted castration resistance. Conversely, this resistance was inhibited with the removal of macrophages via clodronate liposomes. When patient-derived CaP LuCaP xenografts were analysed, high levels of WNT5A were correlated with increased levels of CCL2 and BMP6. In addition, higher levels of CCL2 and BMP6 were more commonly observed in intra-femoral transplanted tumours as compared to subcutaneous-transplanted tumours in the patient-derived PCSD1 bone-niche model.  Conclusions:   These findings collectively suggest that WNT5A may be a key gene that induces CRPC in the bone niche by recruiting and regulating macrophages through CCL2 and BMP6, respectively.""","""['Geun Taek Lee', 'Seok Joo Kwon', 'Jongmyung Kim', 'Young Suk Kwon', 'Nara Lee', 'Jeong Hee Hong', 'Christina Jamieson', 'Wun-Jae Kim', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Recent advances in prostate cancer: WNT signaling, chromatin regulation, and transcriptional coregulators.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases acquire resistance to androgen deprivation via WNT5A-mediated BMP-6 induction.', 'Bone morphogenetic protein-6 induces castration resistance in prostate cancer cells through tumor infiltrating macrophages.', 'Macrophages induce neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells via BMP6-IL6 Loop.', 'Deregulated kinase action in prostate cancer: molecular basis and therapeutic implications.', 'Recent advances in prostate cancer: WNT signaling, chromatin regulation, and transcriptional coregulators.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Serum CCL2 Is a Prognostic Biomarker for Non-Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'CC Chemokine Ligand-2: A Promising Target for Overcoming Anticancer Drug Resistance.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Here, we investigated the effect of docetaxel+Aneustat on metastasis.  Methods:   C4-2 cells were incubated with docetaxel, Aneustat and docetaxel+Aneustat to assess effects on cell migration. The LTL-313H model, similarly treated, was analysed for effects on lung micro-metastasis and kidney invasion. The LTL-313H gene expression profile was compared with profiles of PCa patients (obtained from Oncomine) and subjected to IPA to determine involvement of cancer driver genes.  Results:   Docetaxel+Aneustat markedly inhibited C4-2 cell migration and LTL-313H lung micro-metastasis/kidney invasion. Oncomine analysis indicated that treatment with docetaxel+Aneustat was associated with improved patient outcome. The drug combination markedly downregulated expression of cancer driver genes such as FOXM1 (and FOXM1-target genes). FOXM1 overexpression reduced the anti-metastatic activity of docetaxel+Aneustat.  Conclusions:   Docetaxel+Aneustat can inhibit PCa tissue invasion and metastasis. This activity appears to be based on reduced expression of cancer driver genes such as FOXM1.

The expression of ING3 was assessed by IHC on a human prostate cancer tissue microarray (TMA). Gene expression was measured by DNA microarray and validated by real-time qPCR.  Results:   We found that ING3 stimulates cellular proliferation in ex vivo tissues, suggesting that ING3 could be oncogenic. Indeed, ING3 overexpression transformed normal human dermal fibroblasts. We observed elevated levels of ING3 in prostate cancer samples, which correlated with poorer patient survival. Consistent with an oncogenic role, gene-silencing experiments revealed that ING3 is required for the proliferation of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer cells. Finally, ING3 controls the expression of an intricate network of cell cycle genes by associating with chromatin modifiers and the H3K4me3 mark at transcriptional start sites.

Patients and methods:   Between 2010 and 2016, 324 patients with PC and PSA levels of less than or equal to 5 ng/ml were recruited. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 71 (10) years. All patients were treated with a radical prostatectomy±lymphadenectomy. One-hundred and twenty-one patients were under hormonal therapy at the time of PET/CT, whereas 203 were not. The mean (SD) PSA at the time of PET/CT was 1.33 (1.19) ng/ml, the mean (SD) PSA doubling time (PSAdt) was 10 (12) months, and the mean (SD) PSA velocity (PSAvel) was 1.94 (3.31) ng/ml/year. The correlation between continuous and categorical data was assessed using Student's t-test or by analysis of variance and by the χ-test, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analysis was carried out for the identification of clinical variables able to predict the presence of OMD.  Results:   One-hundred and ninety-three patients had a negative F-FCH PET/CT, whereas 131 (40.4%) had a positive scan. Of these latter patients, 35 had a significant F-FCH uptake in the prostatic fossae, 59 in the lymph nodes, and 37 in bone. PSA levels were significantly different between patients with a positive than those with a negative scan (P<0.001). F-FCH PET/CT was negative in the majority of patients with a PSA of less than or equal to 1 (63.2%) ng/ml. More than 60% of patients with a PSAdt of less than or equal to 6 months had a positive F-FCH PET/CT scan for OMD. PSAvel was higher in patients with a positive scan than those with a negative finding. At univariate analysis, PSA level, PSAdt, and PSAvel were predictors of a positive F-FCH PET/CT for OMD, whereas on multivariate analysis, only PSA level and PSAdt were independent predictors (both P<0.01). Furthermore, PSAdt was the only independent predictor of OMD at the lymph node level.  Conclusion:   In patients with early recurrence of PC, F-FCH PET/CT is able to detect OMD in 40% of cases. This finding has an important impact on the detection of PC recurrent lesions that could be treated by local therapy to achieve long-term survival or cure.""","""['Laura Evangelista', 'Lea Cuppari', 'Andrea Guttilla', 'Mario Gardi', 'Andrea Agostini', 'Lorenzo Ruggera', 'Umberto Basso', 'Giorgio Saladini']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['PET/CT with (18)F-choline after radical prostatectomy in patients with PSA ≤2\xa0ng/ml.

We compared the activity of ARN versus bicalutamide on prostate cancer cell lines. The 22Rv1, PC3, and DU145 cell lines were used to study the effect of ARN and bicalutamide on the expression cytoplasmic/nuclear kinetics of AR, AR-V7 variant, phosphorylated AR, as well as the levels of the AR downstream proteins prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2, under exposure to testosterone and/or hypoxia. The effects on autophagic flux (LC3A, p62, TFEB, LAMP2a, cathepsin D) and cell metabolism-related enzymes (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α/2α, BNIP3, carbonic anhydrase 9, LDHA, PDH, PDH-kinase) were also studied. The 22Rv1 cell line responded to testosterone by increasing the nuclear entry of AR, AR-V7, and phosphorylated AR and by increasing the levels of prostate-specific antigen and TMPRSS2. This effect was strongly abrogated by ARN and to a clearly lower extent by bicalutamide at 10 μmol/l, both in normoxia and in hypoxia. ARN had a stronger antiproliferative effect than bicalutamide, which was prominent in the 22Rv1 hormone-responsive cell line, and completely repressed cell proliferation at a concentration of 100 μmol/l. No effect of testosterone or of antiandrogens on autophagy flux, hypoxia-related proteins, or metabolism enzyme levels was noted. The PC3 and DU145 cell lines showed poor expression of the proteins and were not responsive to testosterone. On the basis of in-vitro studies, evidence has been reported that ARN is more potent than bicalutamide in blocking the AR pathway in normoxia and in hypoxia.

Especially in cancer patients, malnutrition is common and known to complicate treatment. This study aims to evaluate the nutritional status and its associated factors in community-dwelling older adults with and without cancer.  Design:   This is an observational study.  Setting:   This study focuses on older community-dwelling people.  Participants:   This study included older people with and without cancer (≥70 years). Cancer patients included patients with a new diagnosis of breast, lung, prostate, or colorectal cancer.  Measurements:   Data collection included measures of nutritional status, quality of life, depression, fatigue, distress and functional status. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess the association between personal characteristics and malnutrition.  Results:   Data were available for 657 people; 383 people without cancer and 274 with a cancer diagnosis. Overall, malnutrition was detected in 245 (37.5%) people; in cancer patients this was 66.1%. Multivariate analysis showed that having cancer (OR 14.4, 95% CI: 8.01 - 23.3), being male (OR 2.38, 95% CI: 1.49 - 3.70), having depression (OR 13.5, 95% CI: 6.02-30.0), distress (OR 2.60, 95% CI: 1.55 - 4.37) and impaired instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) (OR 2.63, 95% CI: 1.63 - 4.24) were associated with a higher risk of malnutrition.

The aberrant dysfunction of tumor suppressor p53 has an important role in the prognosis of cancer. We previously found that androgen treatments translocate p53 to the cytoplasm. The mechanism of this translocation depends on sumoylation of p53 by complex of SUMO E3 ligase RanBP2 with androgen-induced GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 2 (G3BP2). Here, we identified tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)/estrogen-responsive finger protein (Efp) as a novel interacting partner of G3BP2 protein complex. Then, we demonstrated that TRIM25 knockdown resulted in p53 downstream activation for cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis induction in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. In contrast, overexpression of TRIM25 promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis by docetaxel treatment in LNCaP cells. We observed that p53 activity was reduced by mechanism of G3BP2-mediated nuclear export in TRIM25-overexpressing prostate cancer cells. We also found TRIM25 is important for G3BP2/RanBP2-mediated p53 modification. Clinically, we newly demonstrated that TRIM25 is a prognostic factor for prostate cancer patients. Expression of TRIM25 is significantly associated with cytoplasmic p53 expression and G3BP2. Moreover, TRIM25 knockdown results in reduced tumor growth and increased p53 activity in the mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer. Thus, our findings show that overexpression of TRIM25 promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation and cell survival by modulating p53 nuclear export mechanism with G3BP2 interaction.""","""['Ken-Ichi Takayama', 'Takashi Suzuki', 'Tomoaki Tanaka', 'Tetsuya Fujimura', 'Satoru Takahashi', 'Tomohiko Urano', 'Kazuhiro Ikeda', 'Satoshi Inoue']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Androgen induces G3BP2 and SUMO-mediated p53 nuclear export in prostate cancer.', 'Association of USP10 with G3BP2 Inhibits p53 Signaling and Contributes to Poor Outcome in Prostate Cancer.', 'The ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 targets ERG for degradation in prostate cancer.', 'Efp/TRIM25 and Its Related Protein, TRIM47, in Hormone-Dependent Cancers.', 'The role of Trim25 in development, disease and RNA metabolism.', 'TRIM25 promotes temozolomide resistance in glioma by regulating oxidative stress and ferroptotic cell death via the ubiquitination of keap1.', 'Ribonuclease H2 Subunit A Preserves Genomic Integrity and Promotes Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'USP7- and PRMT5-dependent G3BP2 stabilization drives de novo lipogenesis and tumorigenesis of HNSC.', 'The E3 Ligase TRIM25 Impairs Apoptotic Cell Death in Colon Carcinoma Cells via Destabilization of Caspase-7 mRNA: A Possible Role of hnRNPH1.', 'Par14 interacts with the androgen receptor, augmenting both its transcriptional activity and prostate cancer proliferation.']"""

We have found that the nuclear ERK-selective phosphatase DUSP5 is downregulated in colorectal tumours and cell lines, as previously observed in gastric and prostate cancer. The DUSP5 promoter is methylated in a subset of CRC cell lines and primary tumours, particularly those with a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). However, this epigenetic change alone could not account for reduced DUSP5 expression in CRC cells. Functionally, DUSP5 depletion failed to alter ERK signalling or proliferation in CRC cell lines, and its transgenic overexpression in the mouse intestine had minimal impact on normal intestinal homeostasis or tumour development.

USP10 maintains p53 protein levels and controls epigenetic changes induced by the androgen receptor (AR). GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 2 (G3BP2), an androgen-responsive gene, is known as the main component of stress granules (SG) that interacts with USP10 in SGs. This study explores the roles of USP10 in prostate cancer progression in p53, G3BP2, and AR signaling. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequence analysis, it was found that USP10 is transcriptionally induced with AR recruitment to an intronic region. Furthermore, USP10 regulates androgen-mediated signaling and cell growth. USP10 maintained G3BP2 protein stability by reducing polyubiquitylation. G3BP2-dependent growth activation and p53 nuclear export that reduced p53 signaling were repressed by USP10 knockdown. Clinically, USP10 was expressed primarily in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer tissues. High levels of USP10 expression were strongly correlated with high levels of AR, G3BP2, and p53 in the cytoplasm. High expression of USP10 was significantly associated with poor prognosis of patients with prostate cancer. Taken together, USP10 has a repressive effect on p53 signaling for cell growth by regulating G3BP2 expression. These findings highlight an important oncogenic aspect of USP10 through its modulation of the p53-G3BP2 complex and AR signaling in prostate cancer.Implications: These findings elucidate the oncogenic role of USP10 in prostate cancer through an increase in G3BP2 protein that inhibits p53 activity, in addition to the promotion of AR signaling.

Methods:   A series of acceptable (majority class, n = 61) and erroneous (minority class, n = 12) RT plans as well as a disjoint set of acceptable plans used to develop features (n = 273) were used to develop a dataset for testing. A series of five widely used imbalanced-data classification algorithms were tested with a modularized guided undersampling procedure that includes ensemble-outlier filtering and normalized-cut sampling.  Results:   Hybrid methods including either ensemble-outlier filtering or both filtering and normalized-cut sampling yielded the strongest performance in identifying unacceptable treatment plans. Specifically, five methods demonstrated superior performance in both area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and false positive rate when the true positive rate is equal to one. Furthermore, ensemble-outlier filtering significantly improved results in all but one hybrid method (p < 0.01). Finally, ensemble-outlier filtering methods identified four minority instances that were considered outliers in over 96% of cross-validation iterations. Such instances may be considered distinct planning errors and merit additional inspection, providing potential areas of improvement for the planning process.

However, the precise mechanisms of the carcinoma's development from HGPIN are unclear. Many studies have attempted a comparative molecular genetic characterisation of HGPIN and its corresponding carcinoma to study this transformation. However, to date, some HGPIN mimickers, such as intraductal carcinoma, which can engage in retrograde colonisation of the prostatic acini in an HGPIN-like manner, have been described. In this work, we hypothesise that the lesion formerly known as HGPIN adjacent to invasive carcinoma does not necessarily represent its respective precursor lesion. This hypothesis stems from recent morphological, experimental, and theoretical evidence on the development of tumour clonality, as well as recent studies outlining the three-dimensional architecture of prostate adenocarcinomas (most importantly, their interconnection with the tumoural glandular system).

Except for malignancies of gynaecological organs, ER remains largely unutilised as a target to treat cancers of ER-expressing brain, prostate, skin etc. We have previously developed oestrogen targeting cationic lipid molecule (ES-C10), which showed targeted killing of ER + breast and skin cancer cells. In this study, we explored the targeting ability of ES-C10 as a ligand as well as its additive killing effect (if any), when incorporated in two different liposomes (DCME and DCDE), carrying two anticancer molecules MCIS3 and Docetaxel™, respectively. DCME and DCDE exhibited higher cytotoxicity in ER + cancer cells than in ER - cancer or in non-cancer cells. Both liposomes induced ER-mediated cytotoxicity and caspase 3-induced apoptosis in ER + melanoma cells. Further, decreased levels of pAkt, and increased levels of PTEN and p53 were also observed. Both the targeted liposomes were least haemolytic. These selectively delivered drug-cargoes to tumour mass over other vital organs and induced better anti-tumour effect, which led to increased survivability than their respective controls. In conclusion, we demonstrated the development of two independent liposomal drug-delivery systems associated with an anticancer, oestrogen-structure based ligand for efficient, ER-mediated anti-melanoma effect.""","""['Anirban Ganguly', 'Hari Krishna Reddy Rachamalla', 'Dwaipayan Bhattacharya', 'Keerti Bhamidipati', 'Abhishek Pal', 'Halley Gora Ravuri', 'Sumana Chakravarty', 'Susanta Sekhar Adhikari', 'Rajkumar Banerjee']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Drug Target""","""['Peptide-modified vemurafenib-loaded liposomes for targeted inhibition of melanoma via the skin.', 'Targeted liposomal c-myc antisense oligodeoxynucleotides induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth and metastases in human melanoma models.', 'Development of new estradiol-cationic lipid hybrids: ten-carbon twin chain cationic lipid is a more suitable partner for estradiol to elicit better anticancer activity.', 'A review on liposome-based therapeutic approaches against malignant melanoma.', 'Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery for treating melanoma.']"""

Transurethral resection and laser vaporization are second line interventions, while the role of laparoscopic extraperitoneal adenomectomy is not fully understood.  Aim:   To evaluate the role of laparoscopic technique as a surgical modality for BPH greater than 80 cm3.  Materials and methods:   This study retrospectively evaluated the results of 79 patients (mean age 68 years) who underwent transcapsular extraperitoneoscopic adenomectomy from 2011 to 2016.  Results:   The mean operative time was 206 (100-450) min; the prostate volume was 134 (80-300) cm3, blood loss was 256 (30-1200) ml. The I-PSS score after surgery decreased by an average of 18.3 points, the maximum urinary flow rate increased by 12 ml/s, the residual urine volume reduced from 147 to 28 ml. 35 (44%) patients underwent simultaneous operations (inguinal hernioplasty, cystolithotomy, etc.). There was one intraoperative complication, and 10 (12.6%) patients had postoperative complications. There were no conversions to open surgery. Incidental prostate cancer was detected in one patient. None of the patients required repeat surgery for infravesical obstruction.  Conclusion:   Extraperitoneoscopic adenomectomy is efficient, safe and reproducible surgical modality able to take the place of open surgery. There is a need for an evidence base to support the optimal choice between various minimally invasive techniques. Currently, laparoscopic procedure is more justified in patients with concomitant diseases, which can be simultaneously corrected.""","""['R G Biktimirov', 'A G Martov', 'T R Biktimirov', 'A A Kaputovskii']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['Comparative study of extraperitoneoscopic adenomectomy and monopolar transurethral resection in surgical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia with prostate volume of 100180 cm3.', 'Millin adenomectomy in the era of laser enucleation: results in a series of 240 cases.', 'Feasibility of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) for recurrent/residual benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).', 'Comparative study between laparoscopic extraperitoneal and open adenomectomy.', 'Laparoscopic adenomectomy in BPH - Does it have a role today?']"""

These patients receive a combination of drugs, which involves high risk for drug-drug interaction. NAF exhibits superior efficacy but must be administered at a much higher dosage than other therapeutic drugs. We previously showed that extensive glucuronidation of NAF enantiomers caused poor bioavailability. However, the metabolic pathway and mechanism of action of NAF enantiomer remain to be elucidated. The present study was performed to identify the human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) responsible for the glucuronidation of NAF enantiomers and to investigate the potential inhibition of UGT activity by NAF. The major metabolic sites examined were liver and kidney, which were compared with intestine. Screening of 12 recombinant UGTs showed that UGT2B7 primarily contributed to the metabolism of both enantiomers. Moreover, enzyme kinetics for R(+)-NAF, UGT2B7 (mean Km, 21 μM; mean Vmax, 1043 pmol/min/mg) showed significantly higher activity than observed for UGT2B4 and UGT1A9. UGT2B4 (mean Km, 55 μM; mean Vmax, 1976 pmol/min/mg) and UGT2B7 (mean Km, 38 μM; mean Vmax, 1331 pmol/min/mg) showed significantly higher catalysis of glucuronidation of S(-)-NAF than UGT1A9. In human liver microsomes, R(+)-NAF and S(-)-NAF also inhibited UGT1A9: mean Ki values for R(+)-NAF and S(-)-NAF were 10.0 μM and 11.5 μM, respectively. These data indicate that UGT2B7 was the principal enzyme mediating glucuronidation of R(+)-NAF and S(-)-NAF. UGT2B4 plays the key role in the stereoselective metabolism of NAF enantiomers. R(+)-NAF and S(-)-NAF may inhibit UGT1A9. Understanding the metabolism of NAF enantiomers, especially their interactions with metabolic enzymes, will help to elucidate potential drug-drug interactions and to optimize the administration of this medicine.""","""['Xia-Wen Liu', 'Yi Rong', 'Xing-Fei Zhang', 'Jun-Jun Huang', 'Yi Cai', 'Bi-Yun Huang', 'Liu Zhu', 'Bo Wu', 'Ning Hou', 'Cheng-Feng Luo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Stereoselective glucuronidation of propranolol in human and cynomolgus monkey liver microsomes: role of human hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms, UGT1A9, UGT2B4 and UGT2B7.', 'In Vitro Characterization of Ertugliflozin Metabolism by UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase and Cytochrome P450 Enzymes.', 'Prominent but reverse stereoselectivity in propranolol glucuronidation by human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 1A9 and 1A10.', 'Poor and enantioselective bioavailability of naftopidil enantiomers is due to extensive and stereoselective metabolism in rat liver.', 'Enantiomer selective glucuronidation of the non-steroidal pure anti-androgen bicalutamide by human liver and kidney: role of the human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A9 enzyme.', 'In Vitro Hepatic Assessment of Cineole and Its Derivatives in Common Brushtail Possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and Rodents.']"""

Here, we developed hPEBP4-derived immunogenic peptides for inducing antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) targeting breast cancer. A panel of hPEBP4-derived peptides predicted by peptide-MHC-binding algorithms was evaluated to characterize their HLA-A2.1 affinity and immunogenicity. We identified a novel immunogenic peptide, P40-48 (TLFCQGLEV), that was capable of eliciting specific CTL responses in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice, as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes from breast cancer patients. Furthermore, amino-acid substitutions in the P40-48 sequence improved its immunogenicity against hPEBP4, a self-antigen, thus circumventing tolerance. We designed peptide analogs by preferred auxiliary HLA-A*0201 anchor residue replacement, which induced CTLs that were crossreactive to the native peptide. Several analogs were able to stably bind to HLA-A*0201 and elicit specific CTL responses better than the native sequence. Importantly, adoptive transfer of CTLs induced by vaccination with two analogs more effectively inhibited tumor growth than the native peptide.

One of the proteins involved in NSCLC progression may be special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1), a potent transcriptional regulator, able to control the expression of whole sets of genes simultaneously. SATB1 has been found to be associated with aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis in numerous malignancies, including breast, colon, ovary and prostate cancer. However, its role in NSCLC is still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of SATB1 protein and mRNA in NSCLC and non-malignant lung tissue (NMLT) samples, as well as to determine possible relationships of SATB1 expression with both the expression of Ki-67 and the clinicopathological data of the patients.  Materials and methods:   The study was performed on 277 NSCLC (158 AC, 119 LSCC) and 20 NMLT samples.  Results:   We observed increased SATB1 immunoreactivity in NSCLC when compared to NMLT, and in LSCC when compared to AC cases. We also noted that an elevated SATB1 immunoreactivity was associated with a poor degree of AC differentiation, whereas in LSCC, an inverse relationship was observed. Our analyses revealed that the expression of SATB1 positively correlated with Ki-67 index in NSCLC and LSCC, but not in AC cases. Finally, we found that high SATB1 expression was associated with a better overall survival of patients with NSCLC.  Conclusion:   SATB1 plays diverse roles in different NSCLC subtypes, and its expression may have a prognostic significance for patients with these tumours.""","""['Natalia Glatzel-Plucinska', 'Aleksandra Piotrowska', 'Jedrzej Grzegrzolka', 'Mateusz Olbromski', 'Adam Rzechonek', 'Piotr Dziegiel', 'Marzenna Podhorska-Okolow']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['SATB1 protein is associated with the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition process in non‑small cell lung cancers.', 'Loss of special AT-rich binding protein 1 expression is a marker of poor survival in lung cancer.', 'Expression of special AT-rich sequence-binding protein mRNA and its clinicopathological significance in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'A meta-analysis for CXCR4 as a prognostic marker and potential drug target in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'The Role of SATB1 in Tumour Progression and Metastasis.', 'Analysis of the relationship between Ki-67 expression and chemotherapy and prognosis in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Prognostic Significance of TLR2, SMAD3 and Localization-dependent SATB1 in Stage I and II Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients.', 'SATB1 protein is associated with the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition process in non‑small cell lung cancers.', 'Pre-treatment with Bifidobacterium infantis and its specific antibodies enhance targeted radiosensitization in a murine model for lung cancer.', 'ADRB3 expression in tumor cells is a poor prognostic factor and promotes proliferation in non-small cell lung carcinoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   Forty-seven patients had biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer, and received a CTP. Blood volume (BV), blood flow (BF) and mean transit time (MTT) maps were derived and 1,701 radiomic features were determined per patient. Regression models were built to estimate post-surgical Gleason score (GS), microvessel density (MVD) and distinguish between the different risk groups.  Results:   Six out of the 47 patients had to be excluded from further analysis. A weak relationship between postsurgical GS and one radiomic parameter was found (R2=0.21, p=0.01). The same parameter combined with MTT inter-quartile range was prognostic for the risk group categorisation (AUC=0.81). Two different radiomic parameters were able to distinguish between low-intermediate risk and high-intermediate risk (AUC=0.77). Four parameters correlated with MVD (R2=0.53, p<0.02).  Conclusion:   This exploratory study shows the potential of radiomics to classify prostate cancer.""","""['Stephanie Tanadini-Lang', 'Marta Bogowicz', 'Patrick Veit-Haibach', 'Martin Huellner', 'Chantal Pauli', 'Vyoma Shukla', 'Matthias Guckenberger', 'Oliver Riesterer']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Assessment of prostate cancer with dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography using an en bloc approach.', 'Correlation between CT perfusion and clinico-pathological features in prostate cancer: a prospective study.', 'Integrated CT-perfusion shows no meaningful correlation with PSA and presurgical Gleason score in patients with early prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Radiomics and radiogenomics of prostate cancer.', 'Integrating CT-based radiomic model with clinical features improves long-term prognostication in high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Development of PSMA-PET-guided CT-based radiomic signature to predict biochemical recurrence after salvage radiotherapy.', 'Cone-beam CT delta-radiomics to predict genitourinary toxicities and international prostate symptom of prostate cancer patients: a pilot study.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.', 'Radiomics-based prognosis classification for high-risk prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy.']"""

It contains a central ATPase (BRM or BRG1) and various combinations of 10-14 accessory subunits (BAFs for BRM/BRG1 Associated Factors). Two distinct complexes differing in size, BAF and the slightly larger polybromo-BAF (PBAF), share many of the same core subunits but are differentiated primarily by having either AT-rich interaction domain 1A/B (ARID1A/B in BAF) or ARID2 (in PBAF). Using density gradient centrifugation and immunoprecipitation, we have identified and characterized a third and smaller SWI/SNF subcomplex. We termed this complex GBAF because it incorporates two mutually exclusive paralogs, GLTSCR1 (glioma tumor suppressor candidate region gene 1) or GLTSCR1L (GLTSCR1-like), instead of an ARID protein. In addition to GLTSCR1 or GLTSCR1L, the GBAF complex contains BRD9 (bromodomain-containing 9) and the BAF subunits BAF155, BAF60, SS18, BAF53a, and BRG1/BRM. We observed that GBAF does not contain the core BAF subunits BAF45, BAF47, or BAF57. Even without these subunits, GBAF displayed in vitro ATPase activity and bulk chromatin affinity comparable to those of BAF. GBAF associated with BRD4, but, unlike BRD4, the GBAF component GLTSCR1 was not required for the viability of the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. In contrast, GLTSCR1 or GLTSCR1L knockouts in the metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC3 resulted in a loss in proliferation and colony-forming ability. Taken together, our results provide evidence for a compositionally novel SWI/SNF subcomplex with cell type-specific functions.""","""['Aktan Alpsoy', 'Emily C Dykhuizen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['BRD9 Is a Critical Regulator of Androgen Receptor Signaling and Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'A non-canonical BRD9-containing BAF chromatin remodeling complex regulates naive pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells.', 'SS18 together with animal-specific factors defines human BAF-type SWI/SNF complexes.', 'BAFfling pathologies: Alterations of BAF complexes in cancer.', 'The Many Roles of BAF (mSWI/SNF) and PBAF Complexes in Cancer.', 'The AT-hook is an evolutionarily conserved auto-regulatory domain of SWI/SNF required for cell lineage priming.', 'Differential Contributions of mSWI/SNF Chromatin Remodeler Sub-Families to Myoblast Differentiation.', 'Current Landscape of Genome-Wide Association Studies in Acute Myeloid Leukemia: A Review.', 'The role of chromatin remodeler SMARCA4/BRG1 in brain cancers: a potential therapeutic target.', 'Canonical BAF complex activity shapes the enhancer landscape that licenses CD8+ T\xa0cell effector and memory fates.']"""
