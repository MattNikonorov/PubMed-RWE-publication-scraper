In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether miR-34a attenuates chemoresistance to paclitaxel by regulating target genes associated with drug resistance.  Methods:   We used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to compare miR-34a expression levels in prostate cancer (PC) tissues with normal prostate tissues. The effects of miR-34a inhibition and overexpression on PC proliferation were evaluated in vitro via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis, and cell-cycle assays. A luciferase reporter assay was employed to identify the interactions between miR-34a and specific target genes. To determine the effects of up-regulation of miR-34a on tumor growth and chemo-resistance in vivo, we injected PC cells overexpressing miR-34a into nude mice subcutaneously and evaluated the rate of tumor growth during paclitaxel treatment. We examined changes in the expression levels of miR-34a target genes JAG1 and Notch1 and their downstream genes via miR-34a transfection by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot assay.  Results:   miR-34a served as an independent predictor of reduced patient survival. MiR-34a was down-regulated in PC-3PR cells compared with PC-3 cells. The CCK-8 assay showed that miR-34a overexpression resulted in increased sensitivity to paclitaxel while miR-34a down-regulation resulted in chemoresistance to paclitaxel in vitro. A study of gain and loss in a series of functional assays revealed that PC cells expressing miR-34a were chemosensitive. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-34a increased the sensitivity of PC-3PR cells to chemotherapy in vivo. The luciferase reporter assay confirmed that JAG1 and Notch1 were directly targeted by miR-34a. Interestingly, western blot analysis and qRT-PCR confirmed that miR-34a inhibited the Notch1 signaling pathway. We found that miR-34a increased the chemosensitivity of PC-3PR cells by directly repressing the TCF1/ LEF1 axis.  Conclusion:   Our results showed that miR-34a is involved in the development of chemosensitivity to paclitaxel. By regulating the JAG1/Notch1 axis, miR-34a or its target genes JAG1 or Notch1 might serve as potential predictive biomarkers of response to paclitaxel-based chemotherapy and/or therapeutic targets that will help to overcome chemoresistance at the mCRPC stage.""","""['Xiaobing Liu', 'Xing Luo', 'Yuqi Wu', 'Ding Xia', 'Wei Chen', 'Zhenqiang Fang', 'Jianping Deng', 'Yaxing Hao', 'Xia Yang', 'Teng Zhang', 'Luqiang Zhou', 'Yingbing Wu', 'Qingqing Wang', 'Jie Xu', 'Xiaoyan Hu', 'Longkun Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['MicroRNA-34a Attenuates Metastasis and Chemoresistance of Bladder Cancer Cells by Targeting the TCF1/LEF1 Axis.', 'MiR-34a attenuates paclitaxel-resistance of hormone-refractory prostate cancer PC3 cells through direct and indirect mechanisms.', 'miR-375 induces docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by targeting SEC23A and YAP1.', 'MicroRNA-34a and its target genes: Key factors in cancer multidrug resistance.', 'Expanding the Biotherapeutics Realm via miR-34a: ""Potent Clever Little"" Agent in Breast Cancer Therapy.', ""Notch1 promotes resistance to cisplatin by up-regulating Ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) in triple-negative breast cancer cells."", 'MicroRNAs as clinical tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Role of Nanotechnology in Overcoming the Multidrug Resistance in Cancer Therapy: A Review.', 'MicroRNA-34a, Prostate Cancer Stem Cells, and Therapeutic Development.', 'Interaction between prostate cancer stem cells and bone microenvironment regulates prostate cancer bone metastasis and treatment resistance.']"""

Nanoparticles (NPs) composed of poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) were prepared by single-emulsion solvent evaporation technique and characterized in terms of morphology with atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. HPLC method for simultaneous determination of AbrA and Dtx encapsulation efficacy was developed. Also differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy were provided. To study the effectiveness of cellular internalization and distribution of NPs with AbrA and Dtx co-encapsulation (NP-AbrA/Dtx), a fluorescence microscopy was utilized. NPs prepared had size 256.3 ±9.4 nm and zeta potential -18.4 ±1.4 mV. Encapsulation efficacy for AbrA was 68.7% and for Dtx was 74.3%. NPs were able to control the AbrA and Dtx release within 24 h. The mathematical model of drug release was performed. The results obtained from confocal microscopy showed the effective accumulation of the NP-AbrA/Dtx in the cytoplasm of cells. Synthesized NPs possessed satisfactory parameters and a biphasic release profile, proceeding by the Fick diffusion mechanism, which provide prolonged release of the drugs and maintenance of their concentration. It was shown that NPs loaded with AbrA and Dtx exhibited a high cytotoxic activity on the LNCaP cell line, similar to the combination of free drugs of AbrA and Dtx, but in contrast to the combination of substances, had a synergistic mechanism of action.

Materials and methods:   Information was extracted from the Deceased Registry of the Peruvian Ministry of Health. We analysed age-standardised mortality rates (world population) per 100 000 men. Spatial autocorrelation was determined according to the Moran Index. In addition, we used Cluster Map to explore relations between regions.  Results:   Mortality rates increased from 20.9 (2005-2009) to 24.1 (2010-2014) per 100 000 men, an increase of 15.2%. According to regions, during the period 2010-2014, the coast had the highest mortality rate (28.9 per 100 000), whilst the rainforest had the lowest (7.43 per 100 000). In addition, there was an increase in mortality in the coast and a decline in the rainforest over the period 2005-2014. The provinces with the highest mortality were Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Callao, Lima, Ica, and Arequipa. Moreover, these provinces (except Arequipa) showed increasing trends during the years under study. The provinces with the lowest observed prostate cancer mortality rates were Loreto, Ucayali, and Madre de Dios. This study showed positive spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I: 0.30, P = 0.01).

The challenge remains to differentiate benign and malignant lesions. Based on recent research, acoustic angiography, a novel contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging technique, can provide high-resolution visualization of tissue microvasculature and has demonstrated the ability to differentiate vascular characteristics between healthy and tumor tissue in preclinical studies. We hypothesize that transrectal acoustic angiography may enhance the assessment of prostate cancer. In this paper, we describe the development of a dual frequency, dual-layer colinear array transducer for transrectal acoustic angiography. The probe consists of 64 transmitting (TX) elements with a center frequency of 3 MHz and 128 receiving (RX) elements with a center frequency of 15 MHz. The dimensions of the array are 18 mm in azimuth and 9 mm in elevation. The pitch is [Formula: see text] for TX elements and 140 [Formula: see text] for RX elements. Pulse-echo tests of TX/RX elements and aperture acoustic field measurements were conducted, and both results were compared with the simulation results. Real-time contrast imaging was performed using a Verasonics system and a tissue-mimicking phantom. Nonlinear acoustic responses from microbubble contrast agents at a depth of 35 mm were clearly observed. In vivo imaging in a rodent model demonstrated the ability to detect individual vessels underneath the skin. These results indicate the potential use of the array described herein for acoustic angiography imaging of prostate tumor and identification of regions of neovascularization for the guidance of prostate biopsies.""","""['Sibo Li', 'Jinwook Kim', 'Zhuochen Wang', 'Sandeep Kasoji', 'Brooks D Lindsey', 'Paul A Dayton', 'Xiaoning Jiang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control""","""['Visualization of Microvascular Angiogenesis Using Dual-Frequency Contrast-Enhanced Acoustic Angiography: A Review.', 'An Improved CMUT Structure Enabling Release and Collapse of the Plate in the Same Tx/Rx Cycle for Dual-Frequency Acoustic Angiography.', 'Phantom evaluation of stacked-type dual-frequency 1-3 composite transducers: A feasibility study on intracavitary acoustic angiography.', 'In Vitro Superharmonic Contrast Imaging Using a Hybrid Dual-Frequency Probe.', 'Ultrasound contrast agents and prostate cancer.', 'A Rapid Prototyping Method for Sub-MHz Single-Element Piezoelectric Transducers by Using 3D-Printed Components.', 'Dual-Resonance (16/32 MHz) Piezoelectric Transducer With a Single Electrical Connection for Forward-Viewing Robotic Guidewire.', 'Implementation of a Novel 288-Element Dual-Frequency Array for Acoustic Angiography: In Vitro and In Vivo Characterization.', 'Characterization of an Array-Based Dual-Frequency Transducer for Superharmonic Contrast Imaging.', 'Visualization of Microvascular Angiogenesis Using Dual-Frequency Contrast-Enhanced Acoustic Angiography: A Review.']"""

Since its Food and Drug Administration approval in 1978 for the treatment of advanced ovarian and bladder cancer, this chemotherapeutic has made significant strides and its application has been extended to a large variety of other cancers. However, the vast majority of patients who receive cisplatin therapy often suffer from nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, nausea, and ototoxicity. Numerous methods currently exist for overcoming nephrotoxicity- and nausea-related side effects, but there is no clear prevention to fight ototoxicity and neurotoxicity. In this work, we examined Platin- A, a prodrug of cisplatin and aspirin, using preclinical mouse- and guinea pig-based models and demonstrated its efficacy with reduced ototoxicity. In addition, in vitro studies documented that when Platin- A is used in combination with a clinically relevant dose of radiation, its efficacy can further be improved by attacking cellular bioenergetic profiles, producing multiple modes of DNA damage, and delaying repair of damaged DNA. These studies demonstrated novel properties of the prodrug, Platin- A, highlighting its superior efficacy with reduced toxicity.""","""['Bapurao Surnar', 'Nagesh Kolishetti', 'Uttara Basu', 'Anis Ahmad', 'Erik Goka', 'Brian Marples', 'David Kolb', 'Marc E Lippman', 'Shanta Dhar']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochemistry""","""['The prodrug platin-A: simultaneous release of cisplatin and aspirin.', 'Preclinical activity of lobaplatin as a single agent and in combination with taxanes for ovarian carcinoma cells.', 'Chemotherapeutic potential of diazeniumdiolate-based aspirin prodrugs in breast cancer.', 'In vitro and in vivo models of drug ototoxicity: studying the mechanisms of a clinical problem.', 'True or false?

Retrospective data has shown equivalent oncologic outcomes compared to radiation therapy (RT). RP may provide local tumor control and prevent secondary interventions from local invasion, and may decrease costs.  Materials and methods:   Using SEER-Medicare data from 1995-2011 we identified men with locally-advanced prostate cancer undergoing RP or RT. Rates of post-treatment diagnoses and interventions were identified using ICD-9 and CPT codes. Skeletal related events (SRE), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) utilization, all-cause mortality, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and costs were compared.  Results:   A total of 8367 men with locally-advanced prostate cancer were identified (6200 RP, 2167 RT). RT was associated with increased urinary obstruction, hematuria, infection, and cystoscopic intervention while RP was associated with increased urethral stricture intervention and erectile dysfunction. Compared to RT, RP was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (3.1 versus 5.2 deaths/100-person-years, p < 0.001), prostate cancer-specific mortality (0.8 versus 2.0 deaths/100-person-years, p < 0.001), SREs (2.0 versus 3.4 events/100 person-years, p < 0.001), and ADT utilization overall (7.4 versus 33.8 doses/100-person-years, p < 0.001) and > 3 years after treatment (3.6 versus 4.6 doses/100-person-years, p < 0.001). Overall and cancer specific costs were significantly lower for RP versus RT.  Conclusions:   RT for locally-advanced prostate cancer has a higher incidence of mortality, secondary diagnoses and interventions, SRE, and ADT utilization compared to RP. This may lead to increased costs and have implications for quality of life. Our findings support the utility of RP in appropriately selected men with locally-advanced prostate cancer given the possible decreased morbidity and survival benefit.""","""['Rachael Sussman', 'Filipe L F Carvalho', 'Andrew Harbin', 'Choayi Zheng', 'John H Lynch', 'Lambros Stamatakis', 'Jonathan Hwang', 'Stephen B Williams', 'Jim C Hu', 'Keith J Kowalczyk']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Comparative effectiveness of radical prostatectomy with adjuvant radiotherapy versus radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Effectiveness of androgen-deprivation therapy and radiotherapy for older men with locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Functional outcomes after prostate cancer treatment: A comparison between single and multiple modalities.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Locally advanced prostate cancer: effective treatments, but many adverse effects.']"""

We investigated the importance of metformin in patients treated with radiotherapy or brachytherapy.  Materials and methods:   All patients from a large institutionalized database, treated for primary localized prostate cancer with either brachytherapy or external-beam radiotherapy ± androgen deprivation therapy were identified. Groups were compared by Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox regression models. Multivariate analysis was adjusted for CAPRA-Score, type of treatment and age.  Results:   A total of 2441 patients with complete data was identified. Among the 382 patients (16% of total) were diabetic. Two-hundred and eighty-one of the 382 diabetics (74%) were treated with metformin and 101 were treated with other anti-diabetic medication. Median follow up was 48 months (interquartile range [IQR] 24-84). Two-hundred eighteen patients (9%) died and 150 (6%) experienced biochemical recurrence (BCR). On unadjusted univariate analysis for BCR-free survival, metformin users showed a 50% reduction in BCR compared to non-metformin users. The results remained significant on multivariate analysis comparing diabetic metformin users to non-metformin users (diabetics and non-diabetics combined) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.5-0.6, p = 0.03-0.04) but lost its significance when adjusting for cancer aggressiveness. On multivariate analysis, diabetics had worse overall survival (OS) than non-diabetics (HR 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-2.06, p = 0.01), but diabetics on metformin fared better than diabetics not taking metformin (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.26-0.86, p = 0.01).

The androgen-dependent (AD) transcription factor, androgen receptor (AR), drives PCa-but inhibiting AR or androgen biosynthesis induces remission for only a short time. At which point, patients acquire more aggressive castration-resistant (CR) disease with re-activated AR-dependent signaling. To combat treatment resistance, down-regulating AR protein expression has been considered as a potential treatment strategy for CR-PCa.  Methods:   AD- and CR-PCa cell lines were treated with the well-tolerated FDA-approved oral medicine, riluzole. Expression of full-length or wild-type AR (AR-FL) and constitutively active AR-splice variant 7 (AR-V7) was assessed by immunoblotting. AR-FL/AR-V7 activity was measured using qRT-PCR of AR-target genes. Cytoplasmic [Ca2+ ] levels were measured using a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator microplate assay. Markers of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) pathway and autophagy were assessed by immunoblotting. Direct interaction between AR and selective autophagy receptor p62 was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation.  Results:   We demonstrate that riluzole downregulates AR-FL, mutant ARs, and AR-V7 proteins expression by protein degradation through ERS pathway and selective autophagy. Riluzole also significantly inhibited AR transcription activity by decreasing its target genes expression (PSA, TMPRSS2, and KLK2).

However, the treatment options for metastatic PCa are very limited. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been reported to be an indispensable step for tumor metastasis and is suggested to associate with acquisition of cancer stem cell (CSC) attributes. We propose that small-molecule compounds that can reverse EMT or induce mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) of PCa cells may serve as drug candidates for anti-metastasis therapy. Methods: The promoters of CDH1 and VIM genes were sub-cloned to drive the expression of firefly and renilla luciferase reporter in a lentiviral vector. Mesenchymal-like PCa cells were infected with the luciferase reporter lentivirus and subjected to drug screening from a 1274 approved small-molecule drug library for the identification of agents to reverse EMT. The dosage-dependent effect of candidate compounds was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and immunoblotting. Wound-healing assay, sphere formation, transwell migration assay, and in vivo intracardiac and orthotopic tumor xenograft experiments were used to evaluate the mobility, metastasis and tumor initiating capacity of PCa cells upon treatment. Possible downstream signaling pathways affected by the candidate compound treatment were analyzed by RNA sequencing and immunoblotting. Results: Drug screening identified Amlexanox, a drug used for recurrent aphthous ulcers, as a strong agent to reverse EMT. Amlexanox induced significant suppression of cell mobility, invasion, serial sphere formation and in vivo metastasis and tumor initiating capacity of PCa cells.

Prostate HistoScanning (PHS) is an ultrasound imaging test that might inform prostate biopsy in such men.  Methods:   PICTURE was a prospective, paired-cohort validating trial to assess the diagnostic accuracy of imaging in men requiring a further biopsy (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01492270) (11 January 2012-29 January 2014). We enrolled 330 men who had undergone a prior TRUS biopsy but where diagnostic uncertainty remained. All eligible men underwent PHS and transperineal template prostate mapping (TTPM) biopsy (reference standard). Men were blinded to the imaging results until after undergoing TTPM biopsies. We primarily assessed the ability of PHS to rule out clinically significant prostate (negative predictive value [NPV] and sensitivity) for a target histological condition of Gleason ≥4+3 and/or a cancer core length (MCCL) ≥6 mm. We also assessed the role of visually estimated PHS-targeted biopsies.  Results:   Of the 330 men enrolled, 249 underwent both PHS and TTPM biopsy. Mean (SD) age was 62 (7) years, median (IQR) PSA 6.8 (4.98-9.50) ng/ml, median (IQR) number of previous biopsies 1 (1-2) and mean (SD) gland size 37 (15.5) ml. One hundred and forty six (59%) had no clinically significant cancer. PHS classified 174 (70%) as suspicious. Sensitivity was 70.3% (95% CI 59.8-79.5) and NPV 41.3% (95% CI 27.0-56.8).

We sought to determine the impact of age, comorbidity, and PSA doubling time (PSADT) on competing risks for mortality in men with nmCRPC.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1238 patients diagnosed with nmCRPC in 2000-2015 in the SEARCH database. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards and competing risks regression were used to determine the hazards of overall, prostate cancer-specific (PCSM), and other-cause mortality (OCM) across age, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and PSADT subgroups.  Results:   Men with nmCRPC were elderly (median age 77) and had substantial comorbidity burdens (CCI > 1 n = 701, 57%). Multivariable Cox analysis showed higher CCI was associated with higher hazard of OCM, while slower PSADT was associated with lower hazard of PCSM across all age subgroups. Among those with CCI ≥ 3 (vs. CCI0), the hazard ratio of OCM was 2.7 (95% CI 1.1-6.3), 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.6), and 2.5 (95% CI 1.5-4.0) for those aged <70, 70-79, and ≥80, respectively. Among those with PSADT ≥ 9 months (vs. < 9 months), the hazard ratios for PCSM were 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-0.9), 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.9), and 0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.9) for those aged <70, 70-79, and ≥80. Competing risks curves revealed PCSM was the predominant cause of death for those with PSADT < 9 months across all age and comorbidity groups. PCSM and OCM were relatively equal competitors for mortality among those with PSADT≥9 months except those aged > 80 with CCI ≥ 3, in whom OCM was the predominant cause of death.

Patients and methods:   Retrospective observational study to evaluate the impact of age on the first steady-state sample of patients treated with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide in routine daily clinical practice. The effect of age on target attainment was assessed.  Results:   For abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, 71 and 64 patients were included, respectively. Baseline patients' characteristics and administered doses were not age-dependent. No age-related differences were observed in exposure to the main metabolites of abiraterone acetate, except for active metabolite Δ(4)-Abiraterone (D4A) with a median plasma concentration of 2.5 × 10-3 mg/L in the oldest versus 1.3 × 10-3 mg/L in the youngest age quartile (coefficient of variation, CV, 72%, p = 0.03).

However, this was driven by one patient aged 99 years old. Age had no significant influence on target attainment of either compound.  Conclusions:   This study showed no significant impact of age on the pharmacokinetic profiles of abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, except for the active metabolite D4A and the inactive metabolite carboxylic acid enzalutamide, both having significantly higher exposure in older males. Target attainments of abiraterone and enzalutamide were not significantly affected by age, which suggests that age has no clinically relevant impact on exposure to these oral antiandrogen therapies.

We examined the association between PTEN status on biopsy and subsequent clinicopathologic outcomes in men with GS6 cancers who enrolled in AS.  Methods:   We performed a case-control study of men enrolled in the Johns Hopkins AS cohort with diagnostic biopsy tissue available for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. IHC was performed for PTEN using genetically validated protocols for all patients. Cases included men who underwent grade reclassification to GS ≥ 3 + 4 = 7 on biopsy within 2 years of follow-up (i.e., early reclassification) or reclassification to GS ≥ 4 + 3 = 7 on biopsy or radical prostatectomy during follow-up (i.e., extreme reclassification). Control patients were diagnosed with GS6 cancer and monitored on AS for at least 8 years without undergoing biopsy reclassification.  Results:   Among 67 cases with adequate tissue, 31 men underwent early reclassification and 36 men underwent extreme reclassification. Cases were compared to 65 control patients with adequate tissue for assessment. On initial prostate biopsy, cases were older (median age 67 vs. 65, p = 0.024) and were less likely to meet very-low-risk criteria (64 vs 79%, p = 0.042) as compared to controls. Although not statistically significant, PTEN loss was observed in only 1 (1.5%) of 65 controls as compared to 6 (9%) of 67 cases (p = 0.062).  Conclusions:   PTEN loss was rare among men with GS6 prostate cancer enrolled in AS at Johns Hopkins.

Anomalies in these pathways can be linked to neural deficits. In a different field, contrast-enhanced ultrasound is used to assess anomalies in blood flow with the aim of locating cancer-induced angiogenesis. Like water diffusion, blood flow and transport of contrast agents also shows a principal direction; however, this is now determined by the local vasculature. Here we show how the tractographic techniques developed for magnetic resonance imaging DTT can be translated to contrast-enhanced ultrasound, by first estimating contrast flow velocity fields from contrast-enhanced ultrasound acquisitions, and then applying tractography. We performed 4D in-vivo contrast-enhanced ultrasound of three human prostates, proving the feasibility of the proposed approach with clinically acquired datasets. By comparing the results to histopathology after prostate resection, we observed qualitative agreement between the contrast flow tracts and typical markers of cancer angiogenic microvasculature: higher densities and tortuous geometries in tumor areas.

Incidence and mortality trend plots were used to assess the potential for overdiagnosis. Incidence rates increased from 67% (uterine) to 375% (melanoma). Change in mortality rates ranged from -69% (cervical) to +239% (liver). The greatest divergences occurred in uterine (IMR = 132), prostate (IMR = 9.6), oral (IMR = 9.8) and thyroid cancer (IMR = 5.3). Only in liver cancer did mortality track incidence (IMR = 1.1). For four cancer sites; uterine, prostate, oral and thyroid, incidence and mortality trends are suggestive of overdiagnosis. Trends in melanoma and kidney cancer suggest potential overdiagnosis and an underlying increase in true risk, whereas for cervical and breast cancer, trends may also reflect improvements in treatments or earlier diagnosis.

However, the function of BAF53A in the androgen receptor pathway in prostate cancer cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that BAF53A positively regulates the expression of endogenous AR target genes (e.g. PSA, TMPRSS2, FKBP5, and KLK2) in LNCaP cells. It functions as a coactivator in AR-mediated transcription by interacting with other nuclear receptor coactivators, such as p300 and FLII, and is associated with AR in the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The DHT-induced recruitment of BAF53A to the proximal and distal androgen response elements (AREs) of the PSA gene in the presence of BRG1 (but not BRM) was inhibited by an AR antagonist, suggesting the coactivator function of BAF53A in the SWI/SNF complex. Depletion of BAF53A in LNCaP cells resulted in a significant decrease in growth rate. Furthermore, the expression of BAF53A in prostate cancer tissue was significantly elevated, compared to that in normal prostate tissue, and correlated with the expression of AR, and BRG1, but not BRM.

Patient concerns:   A 22-year-old man presented with gross hematuria and voiding difficulty for 2 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 6-cm mass in the left lobe of the prostate.  Diagnoses:   Core needle biopsy results revealed high-grade sarcoma, suggestive of poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma. The final diagnosis of laparoscopic prostatectomy was MPNST, because it did not show the presence of SYT-SSX fusion transcripts on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis.  Interventions:   Adjuvant radiotherapy was planned because preoperative positron emission tomography-computed tomography (CT) did not show any metastatic lesion and the resection margin was microscopically involved. However, chest CT showed multiple lung metastases a month after prostatectomy. A chemotherapeutic regimen of doxorubicin and ifosfamide was administered.  Outcomes:   The best response to chemotherapy was partial response. After several courses of chemotherapy, he died 9 months after the surgery.

In a previous study, we found that in prostate cancer cells, the GqPCR of GnRH induces apoptosis by reducing the PKC-dependent AKT activity and elevating JNK phosphorylation. Since it was thought that GqPCR induces mainly activation of AKT, we undertook to examine how general is this phenomenon and understand its signaling.  Methods:   We used various cells to follow the phosphorylation of signaling components using western blotting.  Results:   In a screen of 21 cell lines, we found that PKC activation results in the reduction of AKT activity, which correlates nicely to JNK activation and in some cases to apoptosis. To further understand the signaling pathways involved in this stimulation, we studied in detail the SVOG-4O and αT3-1 cells. We found that PGF2α and GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) indeed induce significant Gq- and PKC- dependent apoptosis in these cells. This is mediated by two signaling branches downstream of PKC, which converge at the level of MLK3 upstream of JNK. One branch consists on c-Src activation of the JNK cascade and the second involves reduction of AKT activity that alleviates its inhibitory effect on MLK3, to allow the flow of the c-Src signal to JNK. At the MAPKK level, we found that the signal is transmitted by MKK7 and not MKK4.  Conclusion:   Our results present a general mechanism that mediates a GqPCR-induced, death receptors-independent, apoptosis in physiological, as well as cancer-related systems.""","""['Guy Nadel', 'Zhong Yao', 'Ido Ben-Ami', 'Zvi Naor', 'Rony Seger']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['Gq protein-induced apoptosis is mediated by AKT kinase inhibition that leads to protein kinase C-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone induces apoptosis of prostate cancer cells: role of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, protein kinase B, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways.', 'Stimulation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by gonadotropin-releasing hormone in pituitary alpha T3-1 cell line is mediated by protein kinase C, c-Src, and CDC42.', 'GqPCR-mediated signalling in the spotlight: from visualization towards dissection and quantification.', 'Therapeutic potential of natural compounds that regulate the activity of protein kinase C.', 'VEGF promotes diabetic retinopathy by upregulating the PKC/ET/NF-κB/ICAM-1 signaling pathway.', 'GqPCR-stimulated dephosphorylation of AKT is induced by an IGBP1-mediated PP2A switch.', 'Trafficking to the Cell Surface of Amino Acid Transporter SLC6A14 Upregulated in Cancer Is Controlled by Phosphorylation of SEC24C Protein by AKT Kinase.', 'Dissecting the Hormonal Signaling Landscape in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptors in Prostate Cancer: Molecular Aspects and Biological Functions.']"""

Design:   Longitudinal cohort study (Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study).  Setting:   Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Memphis, Tennessee.  Participants:   Black and white men and women aged 70 to 79 during recruitment (N=3,075; 48% men, 42% black) followed for a median of 13 years.  Measurements:   A committee of physicians adjudicated cause of death, which was categorized as cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, cancer, dementia, pulmonary, infection, kidney, or other causes. Using competing risks regression, we examined whether known risk factors at baseline (demographic characteristics, smoking, body mass index, chronic diseases, physical function, cognition) could explain racial differences in cause-specific mortality risk.  Results:   During follow-up, 1,991 (65%) participants died. Black participants died at higher rates from cancer (hazard ratio (HR)=1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.14-1.63), kidney disease (HR=2.09, 95% CI=1.16-3.74), stroke (HR=1.31, 95% CI=0.98-1.76); and CVD (HR=1.16, 95% CI=0.98-1.37). Poorer physical and cognitive performance at baseline among black participants explained most of the racial difference in risks of dying from kidney disease, stroke, and CVD but not cancer. When examining types of cancer deaths, black participants died at higher rates from multiple myeloma, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer, which baseline risk factors did not explain either.  Conclusion:   Factors contributing to poorer physical and cognitive performance in similarly aged black men and women could be targets to reduce excess mortality from CVD, stroke, and kidney disease.

The goal of this project was to develop a new approach using regional bolus tracking to trigger Bloch-Siegert B1 mapping and real-time B1 calibration based on regional B1 measurements, followed by dynamic imaging of hyperpolarized 13 C metabolites in vivo.  Methods:   The proposed approach was implemented on a system which allows real-time data processing and real-time control on the sequence. Real-time center frequency calibration upon the bolus arrival was also added. The feasibility of applying the proposed framework for in vivo hyperpolarized 13 C imaging was tested on healthy rats, tumor-bearing mice and a healthy volunteer on a clinical 3T scanner following hyperpolarized [1-13 C]pyruvate injection. Multichannel receive coils were used in the human study.  Results:   Automatic acquisition timing based on either regional bolus peak or bolus arrival was achieved with the proposed framework. Reduced blurring artifacts in real-time reconstructed images were observed with real-time center frequency calibration. Real-time computed B1 scaling factors agreed with real-time acquired B1 maps.

By simply rotating the RPPS, a light source can selectively activate the desired working zones of the cyto-sensor. To realize the high-performance paper-based PEC cyto-sensor, a cascaded photoactive interface consisting of neat TiO2 nanotubes arrays, Pt nanoparticles (NPs), and nitrogen-carbon dots was introduced into paper fibers, gaining signal-on PEC state (NTPP for short). Then the NTPP fixed with a hairpin probe H1 allowed the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to happen with CuS NPs-labeled hairpin probe H2 by the free primer strand (PS) triggering; hence, the CuS NPs as the emulative sensitizers were introduced onto the NTPP with the photocurrent intensity decrement for signal-off PEC state. During this process, the PS carefully designed with specific sequences can recognize the target strand (TS) of MCF-7 cells and stimulate HCR by its trigger zone. The presence of MCF-7 cells destroyed the interaction between PS and ZnFe2O4 functionalized TS, causing the PS release from the mixture of PS and TS under the help of a magnet. Then, the released PS, acting as a primer probe, realized ultrasensitive detection of a cell-surface protein. On the basis of this novel protocol, multiple-signal amplification was skillfully imported into the addressable paper PEC chip, resulting in ultrasensitive quantification of carcinoembryonic antigen in the surface of MCF-7 cells. Given the fascinating analytical performances of the developed cyto-sensor, ultralow expression of antigens for MCF-7, A549, and PC 3 cells was discriminated effectively.""","""['Li Li', 'Xiaoxiao Zheng', 'Yuzhen Huang', 'Lina Zhang', 'Kang Cui', 'Yan Zhang', 'Jinghua Yu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Ultrasensitive sandwich-type photoelectrochemical immunosensor based on CdSe sensitized La-TiO2 matrix and signal amplification of polystyrene@Ab2 composites.', 'A ""signal-on"" photoelectrochemical aptasensor based on graphene quantum dots-sensitized TiO2 nanotube arrays for sensitive detection of chloramphenicol.', 'Photoelectrochemical biosensor of HIV-1 based on cascaded photoactive materials and triple-helix molecular switch.', 'Using carbon nanotubes-gold nanocomposites to quench energy from pinnate titanium dioxide nanorods array for signal-on photoelectrochemical aptasensing.', 'Ligating Dopamine as Signal Trigger onto the Substrate via Metal-Catalyst-Free Click Chemistry for ""Signal-On"" Photoelectrochemical Sensing of Ultralow MicroRNA Levels.', 'Research progress on the applications of paper chips.', 'Flexible photoelectrochemical sensor for highly sensitive chloramphenicol detection based on M-TiO2-CdTe QDs/CdS QDs composite.']"""

We used the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to assess relative risks (RRs) and causes of death in SPCs until the year 2015 in patients with a PC diagnosis between 2001 and 2010. Among a total of 4.26 million men, 76 614 were diagnosed with PC at the median age of 71 years. Among them, 8659 (11.3%) received a subsequent diagnosis of SPC after a median follow-up of 4 years. The most common SPCs were colorectal, skin, bladder, and lung cancers, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The ranking was almost identical with first cancers among elderly men in Sweden. The RR for SPCs in prostate-specific antigen-detected PC was approximately equal to RR in other PC. Mortality patterns of PC patients were distinct depending on the presence or absence of SPC. Among patients with SPC, 47.8% died as a result of the corresponding SPC, followed by other causes (22.2%) and PC (18.1%). For patients without SPC, PC and non-neoplastic causes almost matched each other as the main causes of death (48.5% and 47.8%). The results suggest that SPCs appear autonomous from primary PC and reflect incidence and mortality of first cancers in general. SPC was the most common cause of death in patients with SPC; close to half of the patients died due to SPC. For improved survival in PC patients, prevention and early detection of SPCs would be important, and the present results suggest that risk factors for SPC in PC are the same as those for first cancer in general.""","""['Subhayan Chattopadhyay', 'Guoqiao Zheng', 'Otto Hemminki', 'Asta Försti', 'Kristina Sundquist', 'Kari Hemminki']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Impact of family history of cancer on risk and mortality of second cancers in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Association of First Primary Cancer With Risk of Subsequent Primary Cancer Among Survivors of Adult-Onset Cancers in the United States.', 'Second primary cancer after female breast cancer: Familial risks and cause of death.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence-Based Analysis.', 'Risk of extracolonic second primary cancers following a primary colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Clinical characteristics and prostate-cancer-specific mortality of competitive risk nomogram in the second primary prostate cancer.', 'Development and Validation of a Nomogram for Predicting Overall Survival in Patients with Second Primary Small Cell Lung Cancer After Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A SEER-Based Study.', 'Second primary malignancies in colorectal cancer patients.', 'Clinical characteristics and overall survival nomogram of second primary malignancies after prostate cancer, a SEER population-based study.', 'The Risk of Second Primary Cancers in Prostate Cancer Survivors Treated in the Modern Radiotherapy Era.']"""

Methods:   The study cohort consisted of 359 consecutive non-metastatic prostate cancer patients who underwent Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between November 2012 and January 2016. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network prostate cancer risk classification, 164 patients (45.7%) had high- or very high-risk prostate cancer. No patient received adjuvant therapy until documented biochemical recurrence. Biochemical recurrence-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine variables predictive of biochemical recurrence.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 26 months (interquartile range 19-38 months). The overall biochemical recurrence rate was 14.8%, and the median time to biochemical recurrence was 11 months (interquartile range 6-22 months).

To explain this gender gap, several theories have been proposed, including the impact of androgen hormones. The aim of this study was to investigate the differential impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on subsequent risk of developing BCa in men with prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   A total of 196,914 patients diagnosed with histologically confirmed localized PCa between 2000 and 2009 were identified in the SEER-Medicare insurance program-linked database. Competing-risk regression analyses were performed to assess the risk of developing BCa adjusting for the risk of all-cause mortality. Univariable and multivariable competing-risk regression analyses were performed to test the effect of ADT on BCa incidence for each PCa treatment modality.  Results:   Of the 196,914 individuals included in the study, 68,421 (34.7%) received ADT. Median (IQR) follow-up was 59 (29-95) months. Overall, a total of 2495 (1.3%) individuals developed BCa during follow-up. After stratification according to ADT, the 10-year cumulative incidence rate was 1.75% (95% CI 1.65-1.85). In the untreated group, the 10-year cumulative incidence rate was 1.99% (95% CI 1.83-2.15). In multivariable competing-risk regression, the use of ADT was not associated with BCa, after accounting for the risk of dying from any cause (p = 0.1).  Conclusion:   We failed to identify any impact of ADT on the risk of developing a subsequent BCa even after stratifying according to the type of treatment.

However, most publications are based on simulation models of theoretical cohorts, and long-term implications are not usually considered.  Objective:   To assess the real cost differences of two cohorts of men with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) treated with AS or laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) in a public health system.  Materials and methods:   Patients diagnosed from 2005 to 2009 were included in an AS program (Group 1) or treated with LRP at diagnosis (Group 2), with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Actual costs for each patient were calculated on an individual basis: Group 1: semiannual PSA measurements and repeat biopsies are scheduled every 1-3 years. Costs of outpatient clinic visits were calculated, as well as all tests required for monitoring or active treatment. Group 2: costs of the procedure, emergency visits, re-admissions and outpatient clinic visits were calculated, as well as costs of oncological salvage therapies or functional surgical procedures.  Results:   Out of 151 men diagnosed with low-risk PC, 54 (35.8%) were included in an AS (Group 1) and 97 (64.2%) were submitted to LRP (Group 2). Mean follow-up for both groups was 6.5 years (SD 1.8) and 6.7 years (SD 1.4), respectively, p = 0.49. Group 1 had a total cost per patient of 2970.47€.

Results:   Eleven out of 71 patients presented a spontaneous onset of the disease and for 60 out of 71 patients a trigger was detected. Breast cancer (29.6%) and prostate cancer (22.5%) were the most frequent underlying disease for prescription of an antiresorptive therapy, mostly zoledronate. Submucosal soft tissue biofilms significantly differed from biofilms harvested from the MRONJ lesions bottom, yet the most frequent bacteria were equally present in both groups: Streptococcus species (spp.), Prevotella spp., Actinomyces spp., Veillonella spp., and Parvimonas micra.

For scoring of RBM3 expression, NF (nuclear staining fraction)×NI (nuclear staining intensity) was used. The RBM3 expression score was considered indicative of either low (≤4) or high (>4) expression. Western blot analysis was performed on breast cancer cell lines to evaluate RBM3 expression.  Results:   Of the total 361 samples, 240 (66.5%) exhibited high RBM3 expression. High RBM3 expression was significantly associated with positivity for ER (p<0.001), PR (p<0.001), T stage (p<0.001), histologic grade (p<0.001), and % Ki-67 staining (p=0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed that high RBM3 expression was closely associated with prolonged disease-free survival (DFS) (p<0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p<0.001). Western blot analysis revealed reduced RBM3 expression in HCC1954 (HER2-enriched) and BT-20 (basal-like) cells with an aggressive phenotype.  Conclusion:   High nuclear RBM3 expression is strongly associated with a prolonged DFS and OS. Furthermore, RBM3 expression is closely associated with good prognostic markers such as ER and PR in IBC. High nuclear RBM3 expression is, therefore, a critical biomarker of favorable clinical outcomes in IBC.""","""['Sun Hee Kang', 'Jihyoung Cho', 'Hasong Jeong', 'Sun Young Kwon']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Breast Cancer""","""['Nuclear expression of the RNA-binding protein RBM3 is associated with an improved clinical outcome in breast cancer.', 'High RNA-Binding Motif Protein 3 (RBM3) Expression is Independently Associated with Prolonged Overall Survival in Intestinal-Type Gastric Cancer.', 'Decreased expression of RNA-binding motif protein 3 correlates with tumour progression and poor prognosis in urothelial bladder cancer.', 'Low RBM3 protein expression correlates with tumour progression and poor prognosis in malignant melanoma: an analysis of 215 cases from the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study.', 'Cellular Functions of RNA-Binding Motif Protein 3 (RBM3): Clues in Hypothermia, Cancer Biology and Apoptosis.', 'RNA Binding Motif Protein 3 Promotes Cell Metastasis and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Through STAT3 Signaling Pathway in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Systematic analysis of the relationship between ovarian cancer prognosis and alternative splicing.', 'Elevated expression of the RNA-binding motif protein 43 predicts poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Cold stress protein RBM3 responds to hypothermia and is associated with good stroke outcome.', 'The prognostic and clinicopathological significance of RBM3 in the survival of patients with tumor: A Prisma-compliant meta-analysis.']"""

Mutation in the genes of stem cells is required for benign (normal) prostate to develop into prostatic adenocarcinoma. Stem/basal cells survive androgen deprivation therapy in humans and castrated mice to repopulate glandular cells by proliferation when stimulated by androgen. We hypothesized that using different embedding and staining methods, it would be possible to identify two types of stem cells in human prostate by localization of CD133.  Materials and methods:   Prostate biopsy or prostatectomy pieces from 13 untreated and eight diethylstilbestrol-treated men with prostate cancer were sectioned, stained by methylene blue and CD133 was localized by immunogold technique.  Results:   Methylene blue stained basic proteins in dark basal cells, but not in light cells. Light basal cells expressed androgen receptors and dark cells estrogen receptors. Light and dark cells expressed CD133, indicating them to be stem cells. Light stem cells produced the lineage of columnar/cuboidal cells. Estrogen-dependent dark cells produced a lineage of columnar/cuboidal cells, that also expressed estrogen receptors.  Conclusion:   Our analysis indicates that stem/basal cells are privileged cells in the basal compartment. Stem cells are not under the regulation of steroid hormones, whereas their lineage of cuboidal/columnar cells are. The lineage of androgen-dependent cells are columnar/cuboidal cells and the lineage of estrogen-dependent cells are also columnar/cuboidal cells. Epon-embedding and methylene blue staining showed two types of CD133-positive stem cells in prostate. Paraffin sections did not show two types of stem cells in prostate and bone marrow leukemia cells. Our study indicates the continuity of embryonic stem cells into adult prostate as organ-specific stem cells.

NE prostate cancer (NEPC) has poor prognosis, and its development is poorly understood.Experimental Design: We applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics to a unique set of 17 prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) to characterize the effects of castration in vivo, and the proteome differences between NEPC and prostate adenocarcinomas. Genome-wide profiling of REST-occupied regions in prostate cancer cells was correlated to the expression changes in vivo to investigate the role of the transcriptional repressor REST in castration-induced NEPC differentiation.  Results:   An average of 4,881 proteins were identified and quantified from each PDX. Proteins related to neurogenesis, cell-cycle regulation, and DNA repair were found upregulated and elevated in NEPC, while the reduced levels of proteins involved in mitochondrial functions suggested a prevalent glycolytic metabolism of NEPC tumors. Integration of the REST chromatin bound regions with expression changes indicated a direct role of REST in regulating neuronal gene expression in prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, depletion of REST led to cell-cycle arrest in G1, which could be rescued by p53 knockdown. Finally, the expression of the REST-regulated gene secretagogin (SCGN) correlated with an increased risk of suffering disease relapse after radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   This study presents the first deep characterization of the proteome of NEPC and suggests that concomitant inhibition of REST and the p53 pathway would promote NEPC.

In this study, we confirmed the expression of enzymes essential for de novo synthesis of androgens in mouse adrenals, with high intratissue concentration of progesterone (P4) and moderate levels of androgens, such as androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone, in the adrenal glands of both intact and orchectomized (ORX) mice. ORX alone had no effect on serum P4 concentration, whereas orchectomized and adrenalectomized (ORX + ADX) resulted in a significant decrease in serum P4 and in a further reduction in the low levels of serum androgens (androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone), measured by mass spectrometry. In line with this, the serum prostate-specific antigen and growth of VCaP xenografts in mice after ORX + ADX were markedly reduced compared with ORX alone, and the growth difference was not abolished by a glucocorticoid treatment. Moreover, ORX + ADX altered the androgen-dependent gene expression in the tumors, similar to that recently shown for the enzalutamide treatment.

Results:   Nine case-control studies and three cohort studies including 83,197 subjects met the inclusion criteria. The overall meta-analysis results showed that individuals with the highest category of DII (dietary inflammatory index) were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (RR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.30-2.02); subgroup analysis showed consistent results. For kidney and bladder cancer, significant positive associations were found in individuals with the highest category of DII score; however, no significant association was found between DII and the risk of urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC).

In this study, we analyzed the contribution of Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in staging and therapy management of newly diagnosed PCa.  Materials and methods:   A total of 78 patients with biopsy-proven PCa who were referred for Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for primary staging were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into risk groups according to the D'Amico risk stratification criteria. All of the patients had undergone pelvic MRI, and 65 patients had bone scintigraphy also. The findings of Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were compared with these conventional imaging (CI) methods for staging of the disease. The relations between SUVmax of the primary tumors and Gleason scores (GSs), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and metastatic extent of the disease were analyzed.  Results:   Of 78 patients, 5 patients were in low-risk group, 18 patients were in intermediate-risk group, and 55 patients were in high-risk group. Metastatic disease was found in 40 (51.2%) of 78 patients in Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Ten patients had regional lymph node metastases, and 30 patients had distant metastases. Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT changed the staging in 44 (56.4%) of 78 patients compared with CI. There was significant difference between the SUVmax of the tumors with GSs of 6 and 7 compared with GSs of 8, 9, and 10 (P = 0.003). The SUVmax were significantly different between the patients with no metastasis (n = 38) and patients with regional lymph node metastases or distant metastases (n = 40; 16.1 ± 10.9, 28.7 ± 25.8, P = 0.003, respectively). There was significant difference between the SUVmax of patients with PSA level less than 10 ng/mL compared with patients with PSA level of 10 or greater and less than 20 ng/mL and PSA 20 ng/mL or greater (P = 0.009). A weak correlation between PSA and primary tumor SUVmax was also found (r = 0.21).  Conclusions:   Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is an important imaging modality for primary evaluation of newly diagnosed PCa changing the disease stage substantially.

Methods:   Impact of CS on growth of prostate cancer was determined in vivo and in vitro.  Results:   Firstly, the serum testosterone level was significantly elevated in mice fed CS. Prostate glands were significantly enlarged (weight index 0.53 ± 0.04 mg/g vs. 0.31 ± 0.04 mg/g, P = 0.006). Furthermore, cell viability was increased twofold in the androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell line (VCaP) after CS treatment. This promoting effect disappeared after bicalutamide was added. In addition, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in mice bearing VCaP xenografts was significantly elevated (0.66 ± 0.04 ng/ml vs. 0.26 ± 0.06 ng/ml, P < 0.001) after treatment with CS. Finally, VCaP tumors in mice treated with CS grew much faster (479.2 ± 78.74 mm3 vs. 283 ± 58.97 mm3, P = 0.074). However, the above promoting effects of CS were not observed in parallel studies using the PC-3 cell line which lacks AR expression.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that CS promotes growth of prostate cancer cells by increasing production of testosterone and stimulating the AR-dependent pathway.

However, the anticancer effect of JIB‑04 against human hepatic carcinoma, and its underlying mechanisms, are still unclear. In the present study, MHCC97H and HepG2 cells were employed to investigate the anticancer effects of JIB‑04 on cell viability and apoptosis. Annexin V/PI staining, a CCK‑8 assay and western blot analysis demonstrated that JIB‑04 induced apoptosis in MHCC97H and HepG2 cells, which was evidenced by the expression of proapoptotic and apoptotic proteins including p53, Bak, Bax, caspase‑3 and caspase‑9. Subsequently, the expression trends of Bcl‑2 and p53 were reversed after co‑treatment with pifithrin‑α (PFT‑α, a p53 inhibitor). The results revealed that JIB‑04 suppressed the cell viability of MHCC97H and HepG2 cells in a concentration‑dependent manner. Meanwhile, it was also demonstrated that JIB‑04 effectively triggered MHCC97H and HepG2 cell apoptosis by downregulating Bcl‑2/Bax expression, and upregulating proapoptotic and apoptotic protein expression via the p53/Bcl2/caspase signaling pathway. JIB‑04 had effects on the inhibition of cell viability and the induction of apoptosis in MHCC97H and HepG2 cells. The underlying mechanism of action of JIB‑04 was associated with the p53/Bcl‑2/caspase signaling pathway.

We analyzed NELL1 DNA methylation in tissues from patients with RCC and in adjacent normal renal tissues. In addition, we evaluated NELL1 methylation in cell lines derived from different urogenital tumors (prostate cancer, urothelial cancer and RCC). We performed regression analyses to determine whether NELL1 methylation is associated with clinicopathological parameters and recurrence‑free survival (RFS). This cross‑sectional study included 98 patients with RCC and 63 paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples. We analyzed a locus in the intron 1 region of NELL1 with pyrosequencing. We performed in silico analysis of NELL1 methylation in the TCGA Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) data set (n=284 patients), which served as a validation study. Statistical analyses were performed with the two‑sided paired t‑test for paired tumor and adjacent normal samples. We used logistic regression for subgroup comparisons and Cox regression for RFS comparisons. The mean methylation level was 6.8% higher in RCC tissues compared to paired adjacent normal tissues (paired t‑test, P<0.001). Methylation levels in RCC were associated with advanced disease (P=0.002), the presence of distant metastases (P=0.004), and shorter RFS (P=0.035, HR: 4.15). In silico validation with TCGA KIRC data for adjacent loci also demonstrated that high relative methylation levels were associated with adverse clinicopathology and shortened RFS.

Localized tumors can be treated via surgery or radiation; however, it remains difficult to prevent disease progression. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is an epigenetic reader protein that binds to acetylated lysine on histones and has been reported to serve critical roles in numerous types of cancers. In the present study, it was demonstrated that BRD4 expression levels were significantly increased in cancerous prostate tissue specimens and cells, which were associated with clinical stage and metastasis. In addition, the present study reported that inhibition of BRD4 via short hairpin RNA or JQ1 (a bromodomain inhibitor) decreased PCa cell proliferation, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, mitigated cell invasion and migration in vitro, and impaired tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, BRD4 inhibition-induced suppression of cell cycle progression was associated with the upregulation of p21 and cyclin D1. c-Myc and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), important genes responsible for cell cycle regulation and anti-apoptotic functions, were downregulated in response to BRD4 inhibition. Furthermore, the present study revealed that c-Myc expression was negatively regulated by p21, and that the induction of p21 via BRD4 inhibition was mediated by forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), rather than p53.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene-1 (NAG-1) has been reported to exert proapoptotic effects and therefore, may serve an important role in cancer prevention. The present study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which GLP stimulates anticancer activity in human prostate cancer (PCa) PC-3 cells. In addition, the role of NAG-1 in GLP-induced cancer inhibition was examined. The results of the present study demonstrated that GLP significantly inhibited cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner in PC-3 cells. Flow cytometry indicated that GLP induced late apoptosis, which was accompanied by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP) cleavage, and inhibition of pro-caspase-3, -6 and -9 protein expression. Furthermore, it was observed that the expression levels of NAG-1, and its transcriptional factor early growth response-1, were upregulated in a time- and dose-dependent manner upon GLP treatment. The results of a luciferase assay demonstrated that GLP induced the promoter activity of NAG-1, thus indicating that NAG-1 may be transcriptionally regulated by GLP. The secretion of NAG-1 proteins into the cell culture medium was also upregulated upon GLP treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of NAG-1 expression by small interfering RNA significantly, but not completely, prevented GLP-induced apoptosis, and reversed the effects of GLP on PARP and pro-caspase expression. It was further demonstrated that GLP inhibited the phosphorylation of protein kinase B and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in PC-3 cells. The present study is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to report that GLP may induce apoptosis of PCa cells, which is partially mediated through NAG-1 induction. The present findings may be helpful in elucidating the anticancer mechanisms of GLP through NAG-1 induction for its chemopreventive potential in PCa.""","""['Kaikai Wu', 'Kun Na', 'Dian Chen', 'Yujie Wang', 'Haitao Pan', 'Xingya Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['A novel anticancer effect of Astragalus saponins: Transcriptional activation of NSAID-activated gene.', 'Cyclooxygenase inhibitors induce apoptosis in sinonasal cancer cells by increased expression of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene.', 'Tolfenamic acid induces apoptosis and growth inhibition in anaplastic thyroid cancer: Involvement of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene-1 expression and intracellular reactive oxygen species generation.', 'Ganoderma lucidum Polysaccharides as An Anti-cancer Agent.', 'The diverse roles of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug activated gene (NAG-1/GDF15) in cancer.', 'An overview of arsenic trioxide-involved combined treatment algorithms for leukemia: basic concepts and clinical implications.', 'Removing the sporoderm from the sporoderm-broken spores of Ganoderma lucidum improves the anticancer and immune-regulatory activity of the water-soluble polysaccharide.', 'Research Progress on the Anticancer Activities and Mechanisms of Polysaccharides From Ganoderma.', 'Understanding the Role of Autophagy in Cancer Formation and Progression Is a Real Opportunity to Treat and Cure Human Cancers.', 'Transcriptional Regulation of GDF15 by EGR1 Promotes Head and Neck Cancer Progression through a Positive Feedback Loop.']"""

Previous work has shown that androgens can drive the expression of alternative mRNA isoforms as well as transcriptional changes in prostate cancer cells. Yet to what extent androgens control alternative mRNA isoforms and how these are expressed and differentially regulated in prostate tumours is unknown. Methods: Here we have used RNA-Seq data to globally identify alternative mRNA isoform expression under androgen control in prostate cancer cells, and profiled the expression of these mRNA isoforms in clinical tissue. Results: Our data indicate androgens primarily switch mRNA isoforms through alternative promoter selection. We detected 73 androgen regulated alternative transcription events, including utilisation of 56 androgen-dependent alternative promoters, 13 androgen-regulated alternative splicing events, and selection of 4 androgen-regulated alternative 3' mRNA ends. 64 of these events are novel to this study, and 26 involve previously unannotated isoforms. We validated androgen dependent regulation of 17 alternative isoforms by quantitative PCR in an independent sample set. Some of the identified mRNA isoforms are in genes already implicated in prostate cancer (including LIG4, FDFT1 and RELAXIN), or in genes important in other cancers (e.g. NUP93 and MAT2A). Importantly, analysis of transcriptome data from 497 tumour samples in the TGCA prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) cohort identified 13 mRNA isoforms (including TPD52, TACC2 and NDUFV3) that are differentially regulated in localised prostate cancer relative to normal tissue, and 3 ( OSBPL1A, CLK3 and TSC22D3) which change significantly with Gleason grade and tumour stage. Conclusions: Our findings dramatically increase the number of known androgen regulated isoforms in prostate cancer, and indicate a highly complex response to androgens in prostate cancer cells that could be clinically important.""","""['Jennifer Munkley', 'Teresa M Maia', 'Nekane Ibarluzea', 'Karen E Livermore', 'Daniel Vodak', 'Ingrid Ehrmann', 'Katherine James', 'Prabhakar Rajan', 'Nuno L Barbosa-Morais', 'David J Elliott']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""F1000Res""","""['Identification of novel androgen-regulated pathways and mRNA isoforms through genome-wide exon-specific profiling of the LNCaP transcriptome.', 'Differential regulation of clusterin and its isoforms by androgens in prostate cells.', 'RNA splicing and splicing regulator changes in prostate cancer pathology.', 'AIbZIP, a novel bZIP gene located on chromosome 1q21.3 that is highly expressed in prostate tumors and of which the expression is up-regulated by androgens in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor involvement in the progression of prostate cancer.', 'Integrating Pharmacogenomics Data-Driven Computational Drug Prediction with Single-Cell RNAseq to Demonstrate the Efficacy of a NAMPT Inhibitor against Aggressive, Taxane-Resistant, and Stem-like Cells in Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Transcript-targeted analysis reveals isoform alterations and double-hop fusions in breast cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and its splice variant, AR-V7, differentially induce mRNA splicing in prostate cancer cells.', 'Pan-cancer driver copy number alterations identified by joint expression/CNA data analysis.', 'Androgen-regulated transcription of ESRP2 drives alternative splicing patterns in prostate cancer.']"""

Consequently, AR-V7 not only recapitulates AR-FL's partial functions but also regulates an additional gene expression program uniquely via binding to gene promoters rather than ARE enhancers. AR-V7 binding and AR-V7-mediated activation at these unique targets do not require FOXA1 but rely on ZFX and BRD4. Knockdown of ZFX or select unique targets of AR-V7/ZFX, or BRD4 inhibition, suppresses growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. We also define an AR-V7 direct target gene signature that correlates with AR-V7 expression in primary tumors, differentiates metastatic prostate cancer from normal, and predicts poor prognosis. Thus, AR-V7 has both ARE/FOXA1 canonical and ZFX-directed non-canonical regulatory functions in the evolution of anti-androgen therapeutic resistance, providing information to guide effective therapeutic strategies.""","""['Ling Cai', 'Yi-Hsuan Tsai', 'Ping Wang', 'Jun Wang', 'Dongxu Li', 'Huitao Fan', 'Yilin Zhao', 'Rohan Bareja', 'Rui Lu', 'Elizabeth M Wilson', 'Andrea Sboner', 'Young E Whang', 'Deyou Zheng', 'Joel S Parker', 'H Shelton Earp', 'Gang Greg Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Cell""","""['Androgen receptor splice variant-7 expression emerges with castration resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor and its splice variant, AR-V7, differentially regulate FOXA1 sensitive genes in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Interplay between Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Androgen Receptor Splice Variants Mediates Castration Resistance.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant, AR-V7, as a Biomarker of Resistance to Androgen Axis-Targeted Therapies in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'LSD1 Inhibition Disrupts Super-Enhancer-Driven Oncogenic Transcriptional Programs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Harnessing transcriptionally driven chromosomal instability adaptation to target therapy-refractory lethal prostate cancer.', 'Dissecting and targeting noncanonical functions of EZH2 in multiple myeloma via an EZH2 degrader.', 'Increased AR expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer rapidly induces AR signaling reprogramming with the collaboration of EZH2.']"""

The study was developed to inform consultations with public health insurances on PET/CT coverage.  Methods:   We evaluated a prospective patient cohort having a clinically indicated PET/CT at a single German University Center from April 2013 to August 2016. The registry collected questionnaire data from requesting physicians on intended patient management before and after PET/CT. A total of 4,504 patients with 5,939 PET/CT examinations were enrolled in the registry, resulting in evaluable data from 3,724 patients receiving 4,754 scans. The impact of PET/CT on patient management was assessed across 22 tumor types, for different indications (diagnosis, staging, suspected recurrence) and different categories of management including treatment (curative or palliative) and non-treatment (watchful waiting, additional imaging, invasive tests).  Results:   The most frequent PET/CT indication was tumor staging (59.7%). Melanoma, lung cancer, lymphoma, neuroendocrine tumor and prostate cancer accounted for 70% of cases. Overall, the use of PET/CT resulted in a 37.1% change of clinical management (95% CI, 35.7-38.5), most frequently (30.6%) from an intended non-treatment strategy before PET/CT to active treatment after PET/CT. The frequency of changes ranged from 28.3% for head and neck cancers up to 46.0% for melanomas. The impact of PET/CT was greatest in reducing demands for additional imaging which decreased from 66.1% before PET/CT to 6.1% after PET/CT. Pre-PET/CT planned invasive tests could be avoided in 72.7% of cases. The treatment goal changed after PET/CT in 21.7% of cases, in twice as many cases from curative to palliative therapy than vice versa.

Design:   Observational study using serial cross-sections, 2003 to 2013.  Setting:   National fee-for-service Medicare.  Participants:   Men aged 68 and older eligible for prostate cancer screening.  Measurements:   National PSA screening practices in men aged 68 and older from 2003 to 2013 and change in regional screening rates in men aged 75 and older.  Results:   The PSA screening rate in men aged 68 and older was 17.2% in 2003, 22.3% in 2008, and 18.6% in 2013 (p < .001 for all differences); rates ended slightly lower than rates in 2003 only in men 80 and older. Racial disparities in screening became less pronounced over this period. In men aged 75 and older, change in regional screening rates varied widely, with absolute rates growing by 15 per 100 enrollees in some areas and declining by the same amount in others. Areas with high social capital, a measure associated with diffusion of new ideas, were more likely to decline; malpractice intensity and managed care penetration had no effect.  Conclusion:   Studying Medicare enrollees over time, we found little reduction in PSA screening and even increases according to race and in some regions.

Purpose:   To evaluate the feasibility of high spectral and spatial resolution imaging using multiecho gradient echo (MEGE) MRI for identification of ablation zones, after FLA of prostate cancers.  Study type:   Prospective.  Population:   Fourteen patients with biopsy-confirmed localized prostate cancers.  Field strength/sequence:   FLA was performed under monitored conscious sedation with a 1.5T MRI scanner. Axial MEGE images were acquired before and after the last FLA. Pre- and postcontrast enhanced T1 -weighted (pT1 W) images were acquired to assess the FLA zone as a reference standard.  Assessment:   The T 2 * maps and water resonance peak height (WPH) images were calculated from the MEGE data. Ablation area was outlined using an active contour method. The maximum ablation area and total ablation volume were calculated from T 2 * and WPH images, and compared with the sizes measured from pT1 W images.  Statistical tests:   Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to determine whether there was significant difference in calculated ablation areas and volumes between T 2 * , WPH, and pT1 W images.  Results:   Average T 2 * (38.9 ± 14.1 msec) in the ablation area was significantly shorter (P = 0.03) than the preablation area T 2 * (57.8 ± 25.3 msec). The normalized WPH value over the ablation area (1.3 ± 0.6) was significantly decreased (P = 0.02) more than the preablation area (2.0 ± 0.9). The maximum ablation areas measured by T 2 * (295.7 ± 96.4 mm2 ), WPH (312.2 ± 63.0 mm2 ), and pT1 W (320.3 ± 82.9 mm2 ) images were all similar. Furthermore, there was no significant difference (P = 0.31) for measured ablation volumes 3310.5 ± 649.5, 3406.4 ± 684.9, and 3672.5 ± 832.4 mm3 between T 2 * , WPH, and pT1 W images, respectively. DATA CONCLUSION: T 2 * and WPH images provide acceptable measurements of ablation zones during FLA treatment of prostate cancers without the need for contrast agent injection.

Herein, we evaluate the cooperative role of ERG and PTEN in oncological outcomes after radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. We evaluated ERG and PTEN status using three previously described cohorts. The first cohort included 235 clinically localized prostate cancer cases represented on tissue microarrays (TMA), evaluated using previously validated FISH assays for ERG and PTEN. The second cohort included 167 cases of clinically localized prostate cancer on TMAs evaluated for PTEN by FISH, and for PTEN and ERG by dual IHC. The third cohort comprised 59 clinically localized prostate cancer cases assessed by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Kaplan-Meir plots and long rank tests were used to assess the association of ERG and PTEN status with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. Of the 317 cases eligible for analyses with evaluable ERG and PTEN status, 88 (27.8%) patients developed biochemical recurrence over a median follow-up of 5.7 years. Overall, 45% (142/317) of cases demonstrated ERG rearrangement and 20% (62/317) of cases demonstrated PTEN loss. Hemizygous and homozygous deletion of PTEN was seen in 10% (18/175) and 3% (5/175) of ERG-negative cases, respectively. In contrast, hemizygous and homozygous deletion of PTEN was seen in 11% (15/142) and 17% (24/123) of ERG-positive cases, respectively. PTEN loss (heterozygous or homozygous) was significantly associated with shorter time to biochemical recurrence compared to no PTEN loss (p < 0.001). However, ERG rearrangement versus no rearrangement was not associated with time to PSA recurrence (p = 0.15). Patients who exhibited ERG rearrangement and loss of PTEN had no significant difference in time to recurrence compared to patients with wild-type ERG and loss of PTEN (p = 0.30).

CITED2 is highly expressed in metastatic prostate cancer, and its expression is correlated with poor survival. The CITED2 gene is highly activated by ETS-related gene that is overexpressed due to chromosomal translocation. CITED2 acts as a molecular chaperone to guide PRMT5 and p300 to nucleolin, thereby activating nucleolin. Informatics and experimental data suggest that the CITED2-nucleolin axis is involved in prostate cancer metastasis.

It is unclear what underlies the decades-long clinical latency before recurrence, but evidence points to the existence of dormant residual tumor cells that disseminated before the primary tumor was eliminated. To design therapies to prevent progression of disseminated tumor cells (DTC) into lethal metastases, it is crucial to understand the mechanism(s) underlying this dormancy. The current study functionally validated our previous observation that implicated the GAS6/AXL axis in mediating DTC dormancy in the bone marrow. AXL-null and AXL-overexpressing prostate cancer cell lines were generated to determine if AXL was necessary and/or sufficient for dormancy. Characterization of these cells in vitro and using in vivo mouse models of DTC growth demonstrated that AXL was indeed sufficient to induce dormancy, but was unable to maintain it long-term and was not absolutely required for a dormancy period. Clinically, AXL expression correlated with longer survival in prostate cancer patients, and AXL was not expressed by cancer cells in primary or metastatic tissue. These data point to a tumor-suppressive role for AXL in prostate cancer, and future work is required to determine if AXL is expressed on human bone marrow DTCs. IMPLICATIONS: The ability of AXL to initiate but not maintain dormancy, coupled with its dispensability, suggests that targeting AXL alone will not prevent lethal metastatic outgrowth, and likely a cooperative network of factors exists to mediate long-term cellular dormancy.""","""['Haley D Axelrod', 'Kenneth C Valkenburg', 'Sarah R Amend', 'Jessica L Hicks', 'Princy Parsana', 'Gonzalo Torga', 'Angelo M DeMarzo', 'Kenneth J Pienta']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Hypoxia stabilizes GAS6/Axl signaling in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'GAS6 receptor status is associated with dormancy and bone metastatic tumor formation.', 'Mer Tyrosine Kinase Regulates Disseminated Prostate Cancer Cellular Dormancy.', 'Gene of the month: Axl.', 'The biology and clinical implications of prostate cancer dormancy and metastasis.', 'How circulating tumor cluster biology contributes to the metastatic cascade: from invasion to dissemination and dormancy.', 'Transcriptome Analysis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Cells Inducibly Expressing MyD88 L265P Mutation Identifies Upregulated CD44, LGALS3, NFKBIZ, and BATF as Downstream Targets of Oncogenic NF-κB Signaling.', 'The genomic regulation of metastatic dormancy.', 'Bone Marrow Endothelial Cells Increase Prostate Cancer Cell Apoptosis in 3D Triculture Model of Reactive Stroma.', '20 (S)-ginsenoside Rh2 inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth by suppressing the Axl signaling pathway in\xa0vitro and in\xa0vivo.']"""

We determined its radiation dosimetry and relationships to pretherapeutic imaging and outcomes. Methods: Thirty patients with prostate cancer receiving 177Lu-PSMA-617 within a prospective clinical trial (ACTRN12615000912583) were studied. Screening 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT demonstrated high PSMA expression in all patients. After therapy, patients underwent quantitative SPECT/CT at 4, 24, and 96 h. Pharmacokinetic uptake and clearance at a voxel level were calculated and translated into absorbed dose using voxel S values. Volumes of interest were drawn on normal tissues and tumor to assess radiation dose, and a whole-body tumor dose was defined. Correlations between PSMA PET/CT parameters, dosimetry, and biochemical and therapeutic response were analyzed to identify relationships between absorbed dose, tumor burden, and patient physiology. Results: Mean absorbed dose to kidneys, submandibular and parotid glands, liver, spleen, and bone marrow was 0.39, 0.44, 0.58, 0.1, 0.06, and 0.11 Gy/MBq, respectively. Median whole-body tumor-absorbed dose was 11.55 Gy and correlated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response at 12 wk. A median dose of 14.1 Gy was observed in patients achieving a PSA decline of at least 50%, versus 9.6 Gy for those achieving a PSA decline of less than 50% (P < 0.01). Of 11 patients receiving a tumor dose of less than 10 Gy, only one achieved a PSA response of at least 50%. On screening PSMA PET, whole-body tumor SUVmean correlated with mean absorbed dose (r = 0.62), and SUVmax of the parotids correlated with absorbed dose (r = 0.67). There was an inverse correlation between tumor volume and mean dose to the parotids (r = -0.41) and kidneys (r = -0.43). The mean parotid dose was also reduced with increasing body mass (r = -0.41) and body surface area (r = -0.37). Conclusion:177Lu-PSMA-617 delivers high absorbed doses to tumor, with a significant correlation between whole-body tumor dose and PSA response. Patients receiving less than 10 Gy were unlikely to achieve a fall in PSA of at least 50%. Significant correlations between aspects of screening 68Ga-PET/CT and tumor and normal tissue dose were observed, providing a rationale for patient-specific dosing. Reduced salivary and kidney doses were observed in patients with a higher tumor burden. The parotid dose also reduced with increasing body mass and body surface area.""","""['John Violet', 'Price Jackson', 'Justin Ferdinandus', 'Shahneen Sandhu', 'Tim Akhurst', 'Amir Iravani', 'Grace Kong', 'Aravind Ravi Kumar', 'Sue Ping Thang', 'Peter Eu', 'Mark Scalzo', 'Declan Murphy', 'Scott Williams', 'Rodney J Hicks', 'Michael S Hofman']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Radiation Dosimetry for 177Lu-PSMA I&T in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Absorbed Dose in Normal Organs and Tumor Lesions.', 'Examining Absorbed Doses of Indigenously Developed 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients at Baseline and During Course of Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy.', 'Post-therapeutic dosimetry of 177Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617 in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Radiation Dosimetry in 177Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy.', 'Therapeutic Responses and Survival Effects of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.', 'Novel radionuclide therapy combinations in prostate cancer.', 'A machine learning-based model for a dose point kernel calculation.', 'Tumor dosimetry using 177Lu: influence of background activity, measurement method and reconstruction algorithm.', 'Determinants of outcome following PSMA-based radioligand therapy and mechanisms of resistance in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PET imaging of new target CDK19 in prostate cancer.']"""

For the purpose of epidemiological studies, it is necessary to ensure accuracy and completeness of cancer diagnoses in CPRD.  Method:   Cases included had a colorectal, oesophagogastric (OG), breast, prostate or lung cancer diagnosis recorded in a least one of CPRD, Cancer Registry (CR) or Hospital Episodes Statistics(HES) between 2000 and 2013. Agreement in diagnosis between the datasets, difference in dates, survival at one and five-years, and whether patient characteristics differed according to the dataset or the timing of diagnosis were investigated.  Results:   116,769 patients were included. For each cancer, approximately 10% of cases identified from CPRD or HES were not confirmed in the CR. 25.5% colorectal, 26.0% OG, 8.9% breast, 32.0% lung and 18.6% prostate cases identified from the CR were missing in CPRD. The diagnosis date was recorded later in CPRD compared with CR for each cancer, ranging from 81.1% for prostate to 59.6% for colorectal, especially if the diagnosis was an emergency. Compared with the CR and HES, the adjusted risk of a missing diagnosis in CPRD was significantly higher if the patient was older, had more co-morbidities or was diagnosed as an emergency. Survival at one and five-years was highest for CPRD.  Conclusion:   Patient demographics and the route of diagnosis impact the accuracy of cancer diagnosis in CPRD.

Urea Transporter B is expressed in skin, but we found that there is little expression in human melanoma tissue. In this study, we examined the effects of UT-B overexpression in melanoma. The results indicated that there is no UT-B mRNA expression in B16 cells, and UT-B overexpression repressed B16 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro. We show that UT-B overexpression causes increased reactive oxygen species production, which may be caused by mitochondria dysfunction. The mitochondrial membrane potential (ΨΔm) was lower in UT-B-overexpressing B16 cells. The proteins involved in complexes I, III, IV and V of the respiratory chain were clearly downregulated in UT-B-overexpressing B16 cells, which would strongly reduce the activity of the electron transport chain. We found that mitochondrial release of cytochrome C into the cytoplasm also increased, indicating that apoptosis had been activated. In addition, UT-B overexpression reduced AKT phosphorylation and MDM2 expression and increased p53 expression; p53 activation may be involved in the anticancer effects of UT-B overexpression. Urea Transporter B overexpression also inhibited tumor growth in vivo.

How to predict prostate cancer progression at the time of diagnosis remains challenging.  Objective:   To identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with death from prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Blood samples from 11 506 men in Sweden were collected during 1991-1996. Of these, 1053 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 245 died from the disease. Stage and grade at diagnosis and outcome information were obtained, and DNA from all cases was genotyped.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A total of 6 126 633 SNPs were tested for association with prostate-cancer-specific survival time using a Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted for age, stage, and grade at diagnosis. A value of 1×10-6 was used as suggestive significance threshold. Positive candidate SNPs were tested for association with gene expression using expression quantitative trait locus analysis.  Results and limitations:   We found 12 SNPs at seven independent loci associated with prostate-cancer-specific survival time. One of 6 126 633 SNPs tested reached genome-wide significance (p<5×10-8) and replicated in an independent cohort: rs73055188 (p=5.27×10-9, per-allele hazard ratio [HR]=2.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72-2.98) in the AOX1 gene.

The SNP rs73055188 is correlated with AOX1 expression levels, which is associated with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer in independent cohorts. This association is yet to be validated in other ethnic groups.  Conclusions:   The SNP rs73055188 at the AOX1 locus is associated with prostate-cancer-specific survival time, and AOX1 gene expression level is correlated with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.

Combined biomarkers may improve prognostication, and ensuring validation against more clinically relevant endpoints are required. The Australian PCa Research Centre NSW has contributed to numerous studies of molecular biomarkers associated with biochemical relapse. In the current study, these biomarkers were re-analyzed for biochemical relapse, metastatic relapse and PCa death with extended follow-up. Biomarkers of significance were then used to develop a combined prognostic model for clinical outcomes and validated in a large independent cohort. The discovery cohort (n = 324) was based on 12 biomarkers with a median follow-up of 16 years. Seven biomarkers were significantly associated with biochemical relapse. Three biomarkers were associated with metastases: AZGP1, Ki67 and PML. Only AZGP1 was associated with PCa death. In their individual and combinational forms, AZGP1 and Ki67 as a dual BM signature was the most robust predictor of metastatic relapse (AUC 0.762). The AZPG1 and Ki67 signature was validated in an independent cohort of 347 PCa patients. The dual BM signature of AZGP1 and Ki67 predicted metastasis in the univariable (HR 7.2, 95% CI, 1.6-32; p = 0.01) and multivariable analysis (HR 5.4, 95% CI, 1.2-25; p = 0.03).

Deciphering their downstream effectors, we aimed at finding new potential prognostic biomarkers and treatment targets for ovarian cancer patients. KLK4-7-transfected (OV-KLK4-7) and vector-control OV-MZ-6 (OV-VC) ovarian cancer cells were established to select differentially regulated factors.  Methods:   With three independent approaches, PCR arrays, genome-wide microarray and proteome analyses, we identified 10 candidates (MSN, KRT19, COL5A2, COL1A2, BMP5, F10, KRT7, JUNB, BMP4, MMP1). To determine differential protein expression, we performed western blot analyses, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry for four candidates (MSN, KRT19, KRT7, JUNB) in cells, tumour xenograft and patient-derived tissues.  Results:   We demonstrated that KLK4-7 clearly regulates expression of MSN, KRT19, KRT7 and JUNB at the mRNA and protein levels in ovarian cancer cells and tissues. Protein expression of the top-upregulated effectors, MSN and KRT19, was investigated by immunohistochemistry in patients afflicted with serous ovarian cancer and related to KLK4-7 immunoexpression. Significant positive associations were found for KRT19/KLK4, KRT19/KLK5 and MSN/KLK7.

TSP1 is downregulated in advanced prostate cancer patient samples and negatively correlates with NE markers and EZH2.

Sequencing was performed on peripheral blood. We evaluated MutationTaster, Polyphen2, SIFT, PROVEAN algorithms, analyzed segregation with cancer disease (in both families with identified BRCA2 variants) and in one family performed LOH (based on 2 primary tumors). We found neither pathogenic mutations nor variants of unknown significance within BRCA1. We identified two BRCA2 variants of unknown significance: c.9334G>A and c.4534 C>T. Disease allele frequency was evaluated by genotyping of 1230 consecutive melanoma cases, 5000 breast cancer patients, 3500 prostate cancers and 9900 controls. Both variants were found to be absent among unselected cancer patients and healthy controls. The MutationTaster, Polyphen2 and SIFT algorithms indicate that c.9334G>A is a damaging variant. Due to lack of tumour tissue LOH analysis could not be performed for this variant. The variant segregated with the disease. The c.4534 C>T variant did not segregate with disease, there was no LOH of the variant. The c.9334G>A variant, classified as a rare variant of unknown significance, on current evidence may predisposes to cancers of the breast, prostate and melanoma.

Whether robotic surgery can be a better option when comparing with laparoscopic surgery is still not well-known.  Methods:   Comprehensive search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Clinical Trials was conducted to identify relevant studies in March 2018. Studies comparing robotic surgery with laparoscopic surgery were included. Measurement of urogenital function was through the International Prostate Symptom Score and International Index of Erectile Function.  Results:   Six studies with 386 patients in robotic group and 421 patients in laparoscopic group were finally included. Pooled analysis indicated that bladder function was better at 12 months in the robotic group after the procedures (mean difference, - 0.30, 95% CI, - 0.52 to - 0.08). No significant difference was found at 3 and 6 months postoperatively (mean difference, - 0.37, 95% CI, - 1.48 to 0.73; mean difference, - 1.21, 95% CI, - 2.69 to 0.28).

In addition, more than 3 million Hispanic Americans live in the US territory of Puerto Rico. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society reports on cancer occurrence, risk factors, and screening for Hispanics in the United States based on data from the National Cancer Institute, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the first time, contemporary incidence and mortality rates for Puerto Rico, which has a 99% Hispanic population, are also presented. An estimated 149,100 new cancer cases and 42,700 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanics in the continental United States and Hawaii in 2018. For all cancers combined, Hispanics have 25% lower incidence and 30% lower mortality compared with non-Hispanic whites, although rates of infection-related cancers, such as liver, are up to twice as high in Hispanics. However, these aggregated data mask substantial heterogeneity within the Hispanic population because of variable cancer risk, as exemplified by the substantial differences in the cancer burden between island Puerto Ricans and other US Hispanics. For example, during 2011 to 2015, prostate cancer incidence rates in Puerto Rico (146.6 per 100,000) were 60% higher than those in other US Hispanics combined (91.6 per 100,000) and 44% higher than those in non-Hispanic whites (101.7 per 100,000). Prostate cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death among men in Puerto Rico, accounting for nearly 1 in 6 cancer deaths during 2011-2015, whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among other US Hispanic men combined. Variations in cancer risk are driven by differences in exposure to cancer-causing infectious agents and behavioral risk factors as well as the prevalence of screening. Strategies for reducing cancer risk in Hispanic populations include targeted, culturally appropriate interventions for increasing the uptake of preventive services and reducing cancer risk factor prevalence, as well as additional funding for Puerto Rico-specific and subgroup-specific cancer research and surveillance.""","""['Kimberly D Miller', 'Ann Goding Sauer', 'Ana P Ortiz', 'Stacey A Fedewa', 'Paulo S Pinheiro', 'Guillermo Tortolero-Luna', 'Dinorah Martinez-Tyson', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Rebecca L Siegel']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""CA Cancer J Clin""","""['Cancer statistics for the US Hispanic/Latino population, 2021.', 'Cancer statistics for Hispanics/Latinos, 2012.', 'Cancer statistics for Hispanics/Latinos, 2015.', 'Elimination of cervical cancer in U.S. Hispanic populations: Puerto Rico as a case study.', 'Cardiovascular mortality in Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic whites: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the Hispanic paradox.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Survival Among People With Second Primary Cancer in the US.', 'Remodeling of Stromal Immune Microenvironment by Urolithin A Improves Survival with Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Access Denied: Disparities in Thyroid Cancer Clinical Trials.', 'Complications after endoscopic submucosal dissection for early colorectal cancer (Review).', 'Exploring the Burden of Cancer in Pakistan: An Analysis of 2019 Data.']"""

Despite these challenges, black men are underrepresented in psychosocial cancer research, possibly due to limited access to supportive oncology programs. The purpose of this article is to examine the acceptability and efficacy for reducing disease-specific distress of a tablet-delivered psychosocial intervention for older men with advanced PC (APC) and explore differences by race. Men with APC (N = 192, 37.5% black, age M = 68.84 years) were randomized to 10-week Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) or attention-control Health Promotion (HP), both delivered via tablets. Assessments occurred at baseline in person, weekly during the 10-week program via tablets, and at 6 and 12 months in person. Weekly session evaluations and postprogram exit surveys assessed acceptability. Efficacy was assessed with a measure of PC-anxiety validated with racially diverse PC patients using linear mixed effects modeling. Study retention and group attendance did not differ by race. CBSM and HP were both acceptable among older APC patients. Black men rated both conditions more favorably than NHW men. Men in CBSM (vs. HP) reported greater reductions in PC-anxiety at 6 months (not sustained at 12 months). Black men in CBSM reported greater decreases in PC-anxiety over time compared with all other groups. Tablet-delivered CBSM and HP were acceptable for black and NHW APC patients, although black men rated both conditions more favorably.

Materials and methods:   Human PC cell lines (LNCaP, DU-145) were cultured with an exogenous LF at a dose corresponding to IC30. The expression levels of steroid hormone receptors (androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor), Her2/neu, Ki-67, E- and N-cadherin, were monitored by immunohistochemical analysis. The levels of miRNAs were assessed using q-PCR. The invasive activity of the cells was examined in a standard invasion test.  Results:   Exogenous LF reduced expression of steroid hormone receptors (ERα and PR) and Ki-67 in both PC cell lines. The expression of E-cadherin increased significantly in LF-treated DU-145 cells. Also, we established the decrease in invasive activity upon LF treatment by 40% and 30% in DU-145 and LNCaP cells, respectively. In DU-145 cells, incubation with exogenous LF resulted in an increase in the expression of oncosuppressive (miR-133a and miR-200b) miRNAs.

Androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) participates in regulating prostate cancer cell proliferation and gene expression. This study aimed to investigate the expression of AR-V7 in circulated tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with prostate cancer and to assess its correlation with drug sensitivity against enzalutamide or abiraterone. MATERIAL AND METHODS Blood samples of prostate cancer patients were collected for separating CTCs, in which mRNA expression level of full-length AR and AR-V7 was measured to analyze their correlation with enzalutamide or abiraterone resistance. Progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with different AR-V7 expression levels was compared. AR-V7 was overexpressed in transfected prostate cancer cells, and its effects on proliferation were analyzed by clonal formation assay. RESULTS qRT-PCR showed AR-V7 overexpression in a total of 13 patients; 76.92% of these patients developed drug resistance, the distal metastasis of which was significantly higher than that in the group with AR-V7 downregulation, with lower PFS (p<0.01). In cultured prostate cancer cells, AR-V7 upregulation resulted in a significantly higher clonal formation rate than in the control group with enzalutamide-containing medium (p<0.05).

AITC induces autophagy in RV1 and PC3 cells, judging from the increased level of LC3-II protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but not in the normal prostate epithelial cell (PrEC). Inhibition of autophagy in AITC-treated cells decreased cell viability and enhanced apoptosis, suggesting that the autophagy played a protective role. There are several pathways activated in ATIC-treated cells. We detected the phosphorylation forms of mTOR, ERK, AMPK, JNK and p38, and ERK AMPK and JNK activation were also detected. However, inhibition of AITC-activated ERK, AMPK and JNK by pre-treatment of specific inhibitors did not alter autophagy induction. Finally, increased beclin-1 expression was detected in AITC-treated cells, and inhibition of AITC-induced beclin-1 attanuated autophagy induction, indicating that AITC-induced autophagy occurs through upregulating beclin-1.

Materials and methods:   This study included a total of 47 consecutive Japanese mCRPC patients treated with cabazitaxel and assessed the prognostic significance of cabazitaxel, focusing on patient age and the correlation of efficacy between docetaxel and cabazitaxel.  Results:   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline was observed in 27 patients (57.4%), including 19 (40.0%) achieving the response defined by PSA decline ≥ 30%. The median overall survival (OS) periods after the introduction of cabazitaxel was 16.1 months. Twenty (42.6%) were judged to have responded to cabazitaxel with a PSA decrease ≥ 30% from the baseline. A 30% PSA response to cabazitaxel was achieved in 4 (50.0%) patients with ≧ 75 years (n = 8) and 16 (41.0%) patients with less than 75 years (n = 39). There was no significant correlation between the PSA response and patients' age (p = 0.707). A 30% PSA response to cabazitaxel was achieved in 13 (46.4%) and 7 (36.8%) patients with and without that to docetaxel, respectively. A 30% PSA response to cabazitaxel was achieved in 5 (16.6%) and 7 (41.2%) patients who had treated with less than 10 cycles docetaxel or 10 ≦ cycles, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that there were no significant correlation of patient age (p = 0.537), the response to prior docetaxel therapy (p = 0.339) or cycles of docetaxel therapy (p = 0.379) with shorter OS.

While preclinical studies and clinical trials have demonstrated antitumor activity of DAG in a variety of malignancies, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying DAG-induced cytotoxicity is essential for proper clinical qualification. Using non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as a model system, we show that DAG-induced cytotoxicity materializes when cells enter S phase with unrepaired N7-guanine DNA crosslinks. In S phase, DAG-mediated DNA crosslink lesions translated into replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that subsequently triggered irreversible cell cycle arrest and loss of viability. DAG-treated NSCLC cells attempt to repair the DSBs by homologous recombination (HR) and inhibition of the HR repair pathway sensitized NSCLC cells to DAG-induced DNA damage.

Materials and methods:   Between 2005 and 2017, the clinicopathological records of patients with high prostatespecific antigen (PSA) levels who underwent initial and repeat prostate biopsies were retrospectively reviewed. The presence of HI and its degree in each biopsied specimen were interpreted by one uropathologist with 20 years of experience. The association between HI and cancer diagnosis was statistically assessed, with p < 0.05 considered significant, and the cancer and non-cancer groups were compared.  Results:   Among the 522 patients with a median PSA levels of 6.5 ng/dL, including 258 (49.4%) whose cancer was diagnosed following repeat biopsy, the median degrees of HI in the initial and repeat biopsies were 25.0% and 41.7%, respectively. Furthermore, 211 (40.4%) and 247 (47.3%) patients had HI (> 0%) on biopsied specimens, respectively. Comparison of the cancer and noncancer groups revealed that a greater rate of HI specimens in the initial biopsy was associated with fewer prostate cancer diagnoses following repeat biopsy (p < 0.001). Other comparisons between the cancer and non-cancer groups showed that the cancer group had a significantly higher rate of hypertension, whereas those non-cancer group had a significantly higher rate of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis (p < 0.05).

Materials and methods:   A total of 1,261 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy during a 3-year period had tumor maps constructed with the Gleason pattern denoted as low-3 or high-4 or 5 and volumetric data generated using commercially available software. Univariate Cox regression models were used to assess whether each volume related parameter was associated with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. A multivariable Cox regression base model (age, prostate specific antigen, Gleason score/grade group, pathological stage and margin status) was compared with 6 additional models (base model plus each volume related parameter) to evaluate enhancement in predictive accuracy. Decision curve analysis was performed to determine the clinical utility of parameters that enhanced predictive accuracy.  Results:   On univariate analysis each parameter was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence except prostate volume. Predictive accuracy of the multivariable base model was high (c-index = 0.861). Adding volume related parameters marginally enhanced discrimination. Decision curve analysis failed to show added benefit even for high grade total tumor volume/total tumor volume, which was the parameter with the highest discriminative improvement.

Objective:   To determine the predictive characteristics of biomarkers for prostate cancer for cancer on biopsy following 3 months of finasteride use compared with placebo.  Design, setting and participants:   383 men from multiple clinical sites with intermediate prostate cancer risk, without history of prostate cancer, were randomly allocated in a double-blinded manner, 4:1, to receive either finasteride or placebo for 90 days at which time a prostate biopsy was performed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcomes were associations of biomarkers with prostate cancer that were tested using multiple logistic regression and area under the receiver operating curves (AUC). Biomarkers for PCA risk (PCA3, TMPRSS2:ERG (T2:ERG) gene product, and PSA) were measured at baseline and at biopsy in a blinded fashion to assess the predictive performance of baseline levels, 90-day levels, and measures of change relative to standard predictors.  Results and limitations:   A total of 292 (233 finasteride; 59 placebo) randomized patients underwent biopsy and were analyzed. On finasteride, baseline and 90-day measures of PCA3 and T2:ERG had similar moderate discrimination capacity with AUCs 62 to 65% (p-values < 0.001 and 0.001, respectively), but their rates of change had no discrimination ability (AUC 51%, (95% CI 43 to 60% p = 0.72) and 48% (95% CI 44 to 60%, p = 0.62), respectively).) Relative to baseline, the 90-day PCA3 and PSA decreased in the finasteride group by 25% and 50%, respectively (both p<0.001). T2:ERG had a smaller, non-significant change post finasteride treatment (p = 0.08).  Conclusions:   Short-term finasteride therapy did not improve performance of the most commonly-employed prostate cancer biomarkers. Threshold values for new biomarkers of prostate cancer should be interpreted with caution in patients receiving finasteride until formal validation of test performance in these patients is conducted.  Patient summary:   Three months of finasteride treatment did not increase the accuracy for predicting the outcome on prostate biopsy but did have a significant effect on biomarker values.

This study investigates the role of minimally invasive treatment with the Argus sling in a heterogenic hard-to-treat patient group.  Method:   The study was a retrospective follow-up study with patients as their own controls. Forty-one patients were enrolled and treated with the Argus sling. Patients enrolled had persisting SUI after prostate surgery for more than 12 months, despite conservative treatment. The pre-operative daily usage of pads and the 24 hours urinary leakage were compared to the post-operative findings. The primary goal was to achieve complete continence or a reduction of more than 50% in pad usage or urinary leakage.  Results:   In total, 71% of the 41 patients enrolled met our primary objective. Complete continence was obtained in 56%, and a reduction of 50% or more was obtained in an additional 15%.  Conclusion:   This study has reproduced continence rates seen in previous studies, but in the hard-to-treat patients with urgency or formerly failed surgery, the continence rate was found to be inferior.

Methods:   In a period running from January 2013 to December 2016, 245 low risk patients underwent RP. Patients were classified into three groups, which included case with pathology grade group one (no upgrading pattern), two-three (intermediate upgrading pattern), and four-five (high upgrading pattern). The association of factors with the upgrading risk was evaluated by the multinomial logistic regression model. It was used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) analysis to assess the efficacy of predictors.  Results:   Overall, tumor upgrading was detected in 158 patients (67.3%). Tumor upgrading patterns were absent in 80 patients (32.7%), intermediate in 152 cases (62%) and high in 13 subjects (5.3%). Median prostate specific (PSA) levels and proportion of biopsy positive core (BPC) were higher in patients with intermediate (PSA=6 ng/mL; BPC=0.28) and high (PSA=8.9 ng/mL; BPC=0.33) than those without (PSA=5.7 ng/mL; BPC=0.17) and the difference was significant (PSA: P=0.002; BPC: P=0.001). When compared to not upgraded cases, higher BPC proportions were independent predictors of intermediate upgrading patterns (odds ratio, OR=36.711; P<0.0001; AUC=0.613) while higher PSA values were independent predictors of high upgrading patterns (OR=2.033, P<0.0001; AUC=0.779).  Conclusions:   PSA and BPC were both independent predictors of tumor upgrading in low risk PCA.

Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2014), we identified 1286 patients with T3 or T4, N 0-3 M0 UTUC. Kaplan-Meier plots, as well as multivariable Cox regression models (MCRMs) relying on inverse probability after treatment weighting (IPTW) and landmark analyses, were used to test the effect of CHT vs no CHT on overall mortality (OM) in the overall population (n =1286), as well as after stratification according to lymph node invasion (LNI).  Results:   Overall, 37.4% patients received CHT. The CHT rate was higher with LNI (62.2% vs 35.2%, p < 0.001). In MCRMs, testing for OM in the overall population, CHT was associated with lower rates of OM (HR 0.71, CI 0.58-0.87; p = 0.001). Similarly, in MCRMs testing for OM in patients with LNI, CHT achieved independent predictor status for lower OM (HR 0.61, CI 0.48-0.78; p < 0.001). Conversely, in MCRMs testing for OM in patients without LNI, no CHT effect was recorded (HR 0.72, CI 0.52-1.01; p = 0.05). All results were confirmed after IPTW adjustment and in landmark analyses.  Conclusions:   Our results represent a contemporary North American report indicating lower OM after CHT for patients with locally advanced non-metastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma, specifically in patients with T3-T4, N1-N3, M0 disease.

Owing to the unclear role of zinc in this process, therapeutic applications using zinc are limited. This study aimed to clarify the role of zinc and its underlying mechanism in the growth of PCa. ZnCl₂ suppressed the proliferation of androgen receptor (AR)-retaining PCa cells, whereas it did not affect AR-deficient PCa cells. In LNCaP and TRAMP-C2 cells, zinc downregulated the expression of AR in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Zinc-mediated AR suppression accordingly inhibited the androgen-mediated transactivation and expression of the androgen target, prostate specific antigen (PSA). This phenomenon resulted from facilitated protein degradation, not transcriptional control. In studies using mice bearing TRAMP-C2 subcutaneous tumors, the intraperitoneal injection of zinc significantly reduced tumor size. Analyses of both xenograft tumors and normal prostates showed reduced expression of AR and increased cell death. Considering the significant loss of intracellular zinc and the dominant growth-modulating role of AR during PCa development, loss of zinc may be a critical step in the transformation of normal cells to cancer cells. This study provides the underlying mechanism by which zinc functions as a PCa suppressor, and forms the foundation for developing zinc-mediated therapeutics for PCa.""","""['Phuong Kim To', 'Manh-Hung Do', 'Young-Suk Cho', 'Se-Young Kwon', 'Min Soo Kim', 'Chaeyong Jung']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Pharmacological inhibition of androgen receptor expression induces cell death in prostate cancer cells.', 'Monomethylated selenium inhibits growth of LNCaP human prostate cancer xenograft accompanied by a decrease in the expression of androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).', 'Suppression of androgen receptor expression by dibenzoylmethane as a therapeutic objective in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Novel anti-prostate cancer curcumin analogues that enhance androgen receptor degradation activity.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'Zinc: From Biological Functions to Therapeutic Potential.', 'The role of zinc in follicular development.', 'Essential Elements and Isoflavonoids in the Prevention of Prostate Cancer.', 'Copper-lowering agents as an adjuvant in chemotherapy.', 'Dietary Phytochemicals in Zinc Homeostasis: A Strategy for Prostate Cancer Management.']"""

To address this gap in knowledge, we analyzed data from veterans (n=971) diagnosed with prostate cancer during 1991-1995. Factors included age, detection of prostate cancer by screening, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, anatomic stage, and Gleason score. Information on molecular markers obtained from immunohistochemical staining of prostate tissue, included B cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2), p53, and microvessel density (MVD), each having a previously documented association with disease progression and increased risk of prostate cancer death. We first examined the bivariate association of demographic, clinical, and molecular factors with age, and found evidence that race, screening status, Gleason score, PSA, bcl-2, p53, and MVD varied across categories of age in this study population. After further characterizing the association between age and Gleason score, we used logistic regression to examine the association between age and molecular markers-accounting for race, screening status, PSA, and Gleason score. Comparing men older than 80 years to those younger than 70 years, adjusted ORs and 95% CIs were 1.89 (0.73 to 4.92), 1.91 (1.05 to 3.46), and 2.00 (1.06 to 3.78), for positive bcl-2, p53, and MVD markers, respectively; no statistically significant associations were found for men 70-79 years old, compared with men younger than 70 years.

Using a pull-down approach coupled with proteomics, we have identified Hsp70 as a cofactor for the NTD of AR in prostate cancer cells. Hsp70 inhibition using siRNA or small molecules indicated that Hsp70 played an important role in the expression and transactivation of endogenous AR. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter/enhancer-driven luciferase assays showed that Hsp70 was also required for transactivation of AR mutant lacking LBD.

Results:   We generate genome-wide regulatory element maps and performed genome-wide chromosome confirmation capture assays (in situ Hi-C) in normal and tumorigenic prostate cells.

We next identify prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF sites involved in long-range chromatin loops. We use CRISPR-mediated deletion to remove prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF anchor regions and the CTCF anchor regions looped to the prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF sites, and we observe up to 100-fold increases in expression of genes within the loops when the prostate cancer risk-associated CTCF anchor regions are deleted.

We report clinicopathologic and outcomes data on 131 patients who were further managed with surgical resection. Using Cox-proportional hazards models, predictors of disease-specific survival (DSS) were analyzed.  Results:   Median follow-up was 7.3 years. Of the 112 patients who underwent postsalvage chemotherapy RPLND, histology was reported as viable GCT in 30 (27%), teratoma only in 26 (23%) and fibrosis in 56 (50%). 5-year DSS for the entire cohort was 74% (95% confidence interval 63%-80%).

Primary outcomes were feasibility and initial efficacy on anxiety and depression; secondary outcomes included demoralization, coping, loneliness, and spiritual well-being.  Results:   Fifty-nine participants were randomized to either the CARE arm (n = 31) or the enhanced Social Work Control arm (n = 28). The intervention was feasible and tolerable, meeting a priori criteria for rates of eligibility, acceptance, retention, assessment, and treatment fidelity.

The protein classically functions as part of the RAD9A-HUS1-RAD1 complex but can also act independently. RAD9A can selectively transactivate multiple genes, including CDKN1A and NEIL1 by binding p53-consensus sequences in or near promoters. RAD9A is overexpressed in human prostate cancer specimens and cell lines; its expression correlates with tumor progression. Silencing RAD9A in prostate cancer cells impairs their ability to form tumors in vivo and migrate as well as grow anchorage independently in vitro. We demonstrate herein that RAD9A transcriptionally controls AGR2, a gene aberrantly overexpressed in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Transient or stable knockdown of RAD9A in PC-3 cells caused downregulation of AGR2 protein abundance. Reduced AGR2 protein levels were due to lower abundance of AGR2 mRNA. The AGR2 genomic region upstream of the coding initiation site contains several p53 consensus sequences. RAD9A bound specifically to the 5'-untranslated region of AGR2 in PC-3 cells at a partial p53 consensus sequence at position +3136 downstream from the transcription start site, determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by PCR amplification. Binding of RAD9A to the p53 consensus sequence was sufficient to drive AGR2 gene transcription, shown by a luciferase reporter assay. In contrast, when the RAD9A-binding sequence on the AGR2 was mutated, no luciferase activity was detected. Knockdown of RAD9A in PC-3 cells impaired cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. However, ectopically expressed AGR2 in RAD9A-depleted PC-3 cells restored these phenotypes.

The mouse prostate has four distinct pairs of lobes, each with their own characteristics. This article demonstrates the proper method of dissection and identification of mouse prostate lobes for disease analysis. Post-dissection, the prostate cells can be further cultured in vitro for mechanistic understanding. Since mouse prostate primary cells tend to lose their normal characteristics when cultured in vitro, we outline here a method for isolating the cells and growing them as 3D spheroid cultures, which is effective for preserving the physiological characteristics of the cells. These 3D cultures can be used for analyzing cell morphology and behavior in near-physiological conditions, investigating altered levels and localizations of key proteins and pathways involved in the development and progression of a disease, and looking at responses to drug treatments.""","""['Disharee Nath', 'Julie R White', 'Gennady Bratslavsky', 'Leszek Kotula']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Generation of Tumor Organoids from Genetically Engineered Mouse Models of Prostate Cancer.', 'In-air production of 3D co-culture tumor spheroid hydrogels for expedited drug screening.', 'Prostate Cancer Spheroids: A Three-Dimensional Model for Studying Tumor Heterogeneity.', 'Biological behavior of prostate cancer cells in 3D culture systems.', 'The mouse prostate: a basic anatomical and histological guideline.', 'Modelling aggressive prostate cancers of young men in immune-competent mice, driven by isogenic Trp53 alterations and Pten loss.', 'Immunomodulatory Role of Surfactant Protein-D in a Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) Model.']"""

Methods:   This is a prospective cohort of men with localised prostate cancer captured in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry Victoria (PCOR-Vic), who received PPRT between January 2010 and December 2015. The primary outcome was ADT use with PPRT. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify patient, tumour and institutional factors influencing ADT use.  Results:   485 men were included in this study - 115 (24%) had pT2 disease, 231 (48%) pT3a, 134 (28%) pT3b and 5 (1%) pT4. Eighteen (4%) men had ISUP grade 1 disease, 139 (29%) ISUP grade 2, 170 (35%) ISUP grade 3 and 158 (33%) ISUP grade 4/5, while 267 (64%) men had positive surgical margins. Median time from prostatectomy to PPRT was 8.1 months (IQR = 5.3-13.9). Sixty-six (14%) patients had ADT with PPRT. In multivariate analyses, men who had increased age (OR = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.01-1.11), seminal vesicle involvement (OR = 3.81; 95% CI = 1.63-8.91) and underwent treatment in regional centres (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.08-4.33) were more likely to have ADT with PPRT.  Conclusion:   We reported that 14% of men treated with PPRT received ADT in a population-based cohort of Australian men, which was less than half of the proportion of ADT use with PPRT in the US. It will be of interest to evaluate the uptake of ADT with PPRT in the coming years following recent publications of level 1 evidence confirming overall survival benefits of ADT with PPRT.""","""['Wee Loon Ong', 'Farshad Foroudi', 'Sue Evans', 'Jeremy Millar']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Large institutional variations in use of androgen deprivation therapy with definitive radiotherapy in a population-based cohort of men with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy in men with node-positive prostate cancer treated with postoperative radiotherapy.', 'National trends in the recommendation of radiotherapy after prostatectomy for prostate cancer before and after the reporting of a survival benefit in March 2009.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.']"""

Methods:   Twenty patients in each of the 3 groups (advanced head and neck, breast, and high-risk prostate) were selected for an in silico planning study. For each patient, reference plans were developed for volumetric modulated arc therapy technique with 6 MV photon beams from a TrueBeam linear accelerator and compared against the corresponding plans for the Halcyon system. Plan comparison was performed in terms of dose volume histogram quantitative analysis.  Results:   Concerning the planning target volumes, with identical dose calculation and optimization algorithms and with identical planning techniques, no clinically relevant difference in coverage (D98%), hot spot (D2%), or homogeneity was observed. Similarly, for all the organs at risk, the dosimetric findings showed that (1) all planning constraints were met by the 2 delivery systems and (2) although statistical significant differences were reported for most of the parameters but none of these were judged of potential clinical relevance.  Conclusion:   The data presented confirmed that the new delivery system can generate treatment plans for volumetric modulated arc therapy with the same dosimetric quality of what is achievable with other systems routinely used in the clinics without significantly changing the current practice.

Though statins are mainly used as antihyperlipidemic drugs, many studies have reported their proapoptotic and antimetastatic activities on prostate cancer. However, the poor solubility and insufficient delivery of statins in tumor site limit their anticancer activity. The present study introduces an efficient hybrid drug delivery system for the treatment of prostate cancer. The system involves the chemical conjugation of Simvastatin (SMV), a statin compound, to acid-terminated poly(D, L-lactic-co-glycolic acid), PLGA chains followed by its conversion into nanoparticles (NPs), with in situ physical incorporation of more SMV and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONS) into the PLGA NPs. The PLGA-based hybrid nanocarrier system has been designed in such a way to evade the low bioavailability of SMV, confer sustained release of both encapsulated and chemically conjugated SMV, as well as enhancing the anti-cancer effect of the formula via the magnetic targeting with the aid of the encapsulated SPIONS. Magnetism, morphological and physicochemical characterizations, as well as in-vitro release studies were performed. Besides, cytotoxicity on human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) was evaluated using MTT assay, cell cycle arrest analysis, annexin V/propidium iodide apoptosis assay and ELISA immunoassay for apoptotic enzyme. Optimum PLGA-based hybrid nanocarrier significantly improved the SMV anticancer activity against human prostate cancer cell line through both apoptosis mechanism and retardation of G2-M phase of cell cycle.

Objective.—:   To assess the effects of preanalytic variables on an analytically validated and fully automated PTEN immunohistochemistry assay.  Design.—:   PTEN immunohistochemistry was performed on Ventana immunostaining systems. In benign prostate tissues, immunostaining intensity across variable conditions was assessed by digital image analysis. In prostate tumor tissues, immunostaining was scored visually.  Results.—:   Delay of fixation for 4 hours or longer at room temperature or 48 hours or longer at 4°C and duration of formalin fixation did not significantly alter immunostaining intensity. Intensity of staining was highest in 10% formalin compared with other fixatives. Tumor tissues with PTEN loss processed using protocols from 11 academic institutions were all evaluable and scored identically. PTEN immunostaining of needle biopsies where tissue blocks had been stored for less than 10 years was more frequently scored as nonevaluable compared with blocks that had been stored for 10 years or longer. This effect was less evident for radical prostatectomy specimens, where low rates of nonevaluable staining were seen for 23 years or more of storage. Storage of unstained slides for 5 years at room temperature prior to immunostaining resulted in equivalent scoring compared with freshly cut slides. Machine-to-machine variability assessed across 3 Ventana platforms and 2 institutions was negligible in 12 tumors, and platform-to-platform variability was also minor comparing Ventana and Leica instruments across 77 tumors (κ = 0.926).

However, PC-related molecular alterations that could guide the timing of repeat biopsies and help monitor PC risk in ASAP-diagnosed patients have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to first investigate the expression of seven different PC-related RNAs that included serine 2 (TMPRSS2): erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) gene (TMPRSS2-ERG, T2E) fusion, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), kallikrein related peptidase 3 (KLK3), androgen receptor (AR), prostate cancer specific antigen 3 (PCA3), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and 9.  Methods:   PC-related RNAs were evaluated using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) system in pathologically ASAP-diagnosed prostate biopsy cores from 55 patients presenting with a normal digital rectal examination and a PSA level of 4-10 ng/mL.  Results:   We detected that positive T2E fusion status (P = 0.013) and the expression of AMACR (P = 0.016), AR (P = 0.016) and MMP-2 (P = 0.013) were independently and significantly associated with PC risk in ASAP patients. There were also several statistically significant correlations between expression levels. Additionally, we demonstrated that T2E fusion positive ASAP patients with higher MMP-2 expression were more likely to be diagnosed with PC at a subsequent biopsy during the follow-up period (P = 0.003).  Conclusions:   Although, more clinical validations are needed for the stratification of PC risk in ASAP-diagnosed biopsy cores, our current results indicate that the coexistence of T2E fusion positivity with MMP-2 upregulation may help clinicians adjust their biopsy timetable and/or assessment of PC risk in ASAP-diagnosed patients with a PSA level of 4-10 ng/mL.""","""['I Ezgi Eryilmaz', 'Berna Aytac Vuruskan', 'Onur Kaygısız', 'Unal Egeli', 'Berrin Tunca', 'Yakup Kordan', 'Gulsah Cecener']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['T2E (TMPRSS2-ERG) fusion transcripts are associated with higher levels of AMACR mRNA and a subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis in patients with atypical small acinar proliferation.', 'Are biomarkers evaluated in biopsy specimens predictive of prostate cancer aggressiveness?', 'High alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) is associated with ERG expression and with adverse clinical outcome in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP): Is a repeat biopsy necessary ASAP?

However, development of a second primary tumor is still poorly investigated.  Objective:   To investigate the impact of RP and EBRT on subsequent risk of developing bladder (BCa) and/or rectal cancer (RCa) among PCa survivors.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 84397 patients diagnosed with localized PCa, treated with RP or EBRT between 1988 and 2009, and older than 65 yr of age were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare insurance program-linked database. Our primary objective was to investigate the effect of EBRT and RP on the second primary BCa and RCa incidence.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable competing-risk regression analyses were performed to assess the risk of developing a second primary BCa or RCa.  Results and limitations:   Of the 84397 individuals included in the study, 33252 (39%) were treated with RP and 51145 (61%) with EBRT. Median follow-up was 69 months, and follow-up periods for patients who did not develop BCa, RCa, or pelvic cancer were 68, 69, and 68 mo, respectively. A total of 1660 individuals developed pelvic tumors (1236 BCa and 432 RCa). The 5- and 10-yr cumulative BCa incidence rates were 0.75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64-0.85%) and 1.63% (95% CI: 1.45-1.80%) versus 1.26% (95% CI: 1.15-1.37%) and 2.34% (95% CI: 2.16-2.53%) for patients treated with RP versus EBRT, respectively. The 5- and 10-yr cumulative RCa incidence rates were 0.32% (95% CI: 0.25-0.39%) and 0.73% (95% CI: 0.61-0.85%) versus 0.36% (95% CI: 0.30-0.41%) and 0.69% (95% CI: 0.60-0.79%) for patients treated with RP versus EBRT, respectively. On multivariable competing risk regression analyses, treatment with EBRT was independently associated with the risk of developing a second primary BCa (hazard ratio: 1.35, CI: 1.18-1.55; p<0.001), but not RCa (p=0.4). Limitations include lack of information regarding the dose of radiotherapy and the retrospective nature with the implicit risk of selection bias.  Conclusions:   Patients treated with EBRT are at increased risk of developing a second primary BCa compared with those treated with RP. However, no differences were found considering RCa incidence in patients treated with RP or EBRT within the first 5 yr after primary therapy. These results need to be validated in a well-designed randomized prospective trial.  Patient summary:   We retrospectively analyzed the risk of developing a second primary bladder or rectal cancer during follow-up for patients treated with radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy for a localized prostate cancer. We found that those treated with external beam radiotherapy are at an increased risk of developing a second primary bladder cancer tumor.""","""['Marco Moschini', 'Emanuele Zaffuto', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'David D Andrea', 'Beat Foerster', 'Mohammad Abufaraj', 'Francesco Soria', 'Agostino Mattei', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Shahrokh F Shariat']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Marco Moschini, Emanuele Zaffuto, Pierre I.

Of these patients, 28 had received standard-of-care radium-223 at Johns Hopkins between February 2013 and February 2018.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) responses and time-to-ALP-progression were the coprimary endpoints. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses, overall survival (OS), and time to next systemic therapy were also evaluated.  Results and limitations:   Of the 28 patients included, 10 men (35.7%) had a germline/somatic HRD mutation (three in BRCA2, and one each in ATM, ATR, CHEK2, FANCG, FANCI, FANCL, and PALB2) and 18 (64.3%) did not. Men with HRD mutations (HRD+) had numerically lower ages (66 vs 73yr, p=0.25), more soft-tissue metastases (50% vs 38%, p=0.43), and higher baseline ALP levels (130 vs 108 U/l, p=0.84). Compared with HRD(-) men, HRD(+) patients showed greater ALP responses (80% vs 39%, p=0.04), longer time to ALP progression (median10.4 vs 5.8mo, hazard ratio [HR] 6.4, p=0.005), and a trend toward longer OS (median 36.9 vs 19.0mo, HR 3.3, p=0.11). PSA responses (0% vs 0%, p>0.99) and time to next systemic therapy (HR 1.5, p=0.39) were similar between the two groups. Results are limited by the retrospective nature of the analysis and the small sample size.  Conclusions:   In this exploratory study, bone-metastatic CRPC patients with inactivating HRD mutations demonstrated significantly improved ALP responses and time to ALP progression. These results should motivate prospective validation of the ""synthetic lethality"" hypothesis between HRD mutations and radium-223 activity.  Patient summary:   In this report, we retrospectively examined outcomes to metastatic prostate cancer in patients with and without DNA repair mutations who received radium-223, a therapy that kills cancer cells by causing direct DNA damage. Our study suggested that patients who have inherited or acquired DNA repair gene mutations derived greater benefit from radium-223 when compared with patients without these mutations. We concluded that radium-223 might have an important role in this setting; however, prospective studies are needed to confirm whether DNA repair mutations truly make radium-223 work better or not.""","""['Pedro Isaacsson Velho', 'Fahad Qazi', 'Sayeedul Hassan', 'Michael A Carducci', 'Samuel R Denmeade', 'Mark C Markowski', 'Daniel L Thorek', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Daniel Y Song', 'Phuoc T Tran', 'Mario A Eisenberger', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Impact of DNA damage repair defects on response to radium-223 and overall survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Germline DNA-repair Gene Mutations and Outcomes in Men with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Receiving First-line Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'The impact of genetic aberrations on response to radium-223 treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases.', 'DNA-Damage-Repair Gene Alterations in Genitourinary Malignancies.', 'Optimal usage of radium-223 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'High-LET radiation induces large amounts of rapidly-repaired sublethal damage.', 'Determinants of outcome following PSMA-based radioligand therapy and mechanisms of resistance in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Urinary DNA as a Tool for Germline and Somatic Mutation Detection in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'DNA Damage Repair Defects and Targeted Radionuclide Therapies for Prostate Cancer: Does Mutation Really Matter?

Methods:   Consecutive patients undergoing LDR with I-125 at our institution between 1998 through 2013 for primary intact prostate cancer were examined. Those with low- and intermediate-risk disease receiving LDR with a minimum of 2 years followup and at least one post-LDR prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were included.  Results:   About 974 patients satisfied inclusion criteria. With median followup of 72 months, biochemical failure occurred in 45 patients. Freedom from biochemical failure as defined by the Phoenix criterion was 96% and 88% at 5 and 10 years, worse for intermediate risk as compared with low risk, with 10-year freedom from biochemical failure of 76% versus 92% (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.7, p < 0.001), respectively. On multivariable analysis, increased prebiopsy PSA, Gleason 4 + 3, and no androgen deprivation therapy were associated with biochemical failure. Gleason 4 + 3 was the factor most strongly associated with biochemical failure (HR = 7.01, p < 0.001). No examined factors were associated with local failure. Gleason 4 + 3 disease increased the likelihood of distant metastasis (HR = 12.4, p = 0.003) and prostate cancer-specific death (HR = 13.2, p < 0.001). No difference in outcomes between patients with Gleason 3 + 3 versus 3 + 4 was observed.  Conclusions:   LDR brachytherapy provided excellent outcomes in this large series of patients treated for localized organ-confined prostate cancer. Local recurrence at 10 years was low at 2.1%. Primary Gleason 4 + 3, higher pretreatment PSA, and no receipt of androgen deprivation therapy were the only factors associated with biochemical failure.

Improvements to patient selection and identification of at-risk patients are central to reducing mortality. We aimed to determine if cancer aggressiveness correlates with androgen levels in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for localized PCa. We performed a prospective, multicenter cohort study between June 2013 and June 2016, involving men with localized PCa scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy. Clinical and hormonal patient data (testosterone deficiency, defined by total testosterone (TT) levels < 300 ng/dL and/or bioavailable testosterone (BT) levels < 80 ng/dL) were prospectively collected, along with pathological assessment of preoperative biopsy and subsequent radical prostatectomy specimens, using predominant Gleason pattern (prdGP) 3/4 grading. Of 1343 patients analyzed, 912 (68%) had prdGP3 PCa and 431 (32%) had high-grade (prdGP4, i.e., ISUP ≥ 3) disease on prostatectomy specimens. Only moderate concordance in prdGP scores between prostate biopsies and prostatectomy specimens was found. Compared with patients with prdGP3 tumors (i.e., ISUP ≤ 2), significantly more patients with prdGP4 cancers had demonstrable hypogonadism, characterized either by BT levels (17.4% vs. 10.7%, p < 0.001) or TT levels (14.2% vs. 9.7%, p = 0.020). BT levels were also lower in patients with prdGP4 tumors compared to those with prdGP3 disease. Testosterone deficiency (defined by TT and/or BT levels) was independently associated with higher PCa aggressiveness. BT is a predictive factor for prdGP4 disease, and evaluating both TT and BT to define hypogonadism is valuable in preoperative assessment of PCa (AndroCan Trial: NCT02235142).""","""['Yann Neuzillet', 'Jean-Pierre Raynaud', 'Jean-François Dreyfus', 'Camélia Radulescu', 'Mathieu Rouanne', 'Marc Schneider', 'Sylvie Krish', 'Morgan Rouprêt', 'Sarah J Drouin', 'Eva Comperat', 'Marc Galiano', 'Xavier Cathelineau', 'Pierre Validire', 'Vincent Molinié', 'Jean Fiet', 'Franck Giton', 'Thierry Lebret', 'Henry Botto']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Obesity and hypogonadism are associated with an increased risk of predominant Gleason 4 pattern on radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Low pretreatment serum total testosterone is associated with a high incidence of Gleason score 8-10 disease in prostatectomy specimens: data from ethnic Chinese patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Low circulating free and bioavailable testosterone levels as predictors of high-grade tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Current state of practice regarding testosterone supplementation therapy in men with prostate cancer.', 'Testosterone Therapy and Prostate Cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life in patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer: CAPLIFE study.', 'Dietary Patterns and Prostate Cancer: CAPLIFE Study.', 'Serine and one-carbon metabolisms bring new therapeutic venues in prostate cancer.', 'The Association of Nighttime Fasting Duration and Prostate Cancer Risk: Results from the Multicase-Control (MCC) Study in Spain.', 'NUAK2 and RCan2 participate in the p53 mutant pro-tumorigenic network.']"""

Such cancer may have a very slow progression or may be associated with a ""dark prognosis"" when tumor cells are spreading very quickly. Prostate cancers have the particular properties to be marked by the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in blood which allows to follow its evolution. At least in its first phase, prostate adenocarcinoma is most often hormone-dependent and, consequently, hormone therapy is a possible treatment. Since few years, hormone therapy started to be provided intermittently for improving patient's quality of life. Today, durations of on- and off-treatment periods are still chosen empirically, most likely explaining why there is no clear benefit from the survival point of view. We therefore developed a model for describing the interaction between the tumor environment, the PSA produced by hormone-dependent and hormone-independent tumor cells, respectively, and the level of androgens. Model parameters were identified using a genetic algorithm applied to the PSA time series measured in a few patients who initially received prostatectomy and were then treated by intermittent hormone therapy (LHRH analogs and anti-androgen). The measured PSA time series is quite correctly reproduced by free runs over the whole follow-up. Model parameter values allow for distinguishing different types of patient (age and Gleason score) meaning that the model can be individualized. We thus showed that the long-term evolution of the cancer can be affected by durations of on- and off-treatment periods.""","""['Clément Draghi', 'Fabrice Denis', 'Alain Tolédano', 'Christophe Letellier']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['Short-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy versus intermediate-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy, with or without zoledronic acid, in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (TROG 03.04 RADAR): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 factorial trial.', 'Intermittent androgen deprivation in prostate cancer patients: factors predictive of prolonged time off therapy.', 'Intermittent complete androgen blockade in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-cancer-specific survival and clinical progression-free survival in men with prostate cancer treated intermittently with testosterone-inactivating pharmaceuticals.', 'Prostate-specific antigen and androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

Taxane-derived anticancer agents are the primary agents used to treat metastatic prostate cancer patients; however, the side effects and acquired drug resistance limit the success of these therapies. Because there is no specific treatment for paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer, it is necessary to develop new targets and therapeutic strategies to overcome the acquired resistance. In this study, the antitumor activity of a novel selenonucleoside (4'-selenofuranosyl-2,6-dichloropurine, LJ-2618), a third-generation nucleoside, and its plausible mechanisms of action in paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer (PC-3-Pa) cells were investigated. The established PC-3-Pa cells exhibited over 100-fold resistance against paclitaxel compared to the paclitaxel-sensitive PC-3 cells. LJ-2618, however, effectively inhibited the proliferation of both cell lines with similar IC50 values in vitro. In PC-3-Pa cells, the activated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was suppressed by LJ-2618 treatment. In addition, Skp2 was found to be over-expressed in paclitaxel-resistant cells, and the transfection of Skp2 siRNA recovered the sensitivity of paclitaxel in PC-3-Pa cells. Furthermore, LJ-2618 significantly down-regulated Skp2 expression in PC-3-Pa cells by promoting degradation and inducing destabilization of Skp2, which triggers G2/M cell cycle arrest. In a xenograft mouse model implanted with PC-3-Pa cells, LJ-2618 (3 or 10 mg/kg) effectively inhibited tumor growth with the enhancement of Skp2 degradation and induction of p27 expression in tumor tissues. These findings suggest that LJ-2618 may have potential for overcoming paclitaxel resistance via promoting Skp2 degradation and stabilizing p27 expression in PC-3-Pa cells. Therefore, the novel selenonucleoside LJ-2618 may lead to the development of a new treatment strategy for patients with paclitaxel-resistant, castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Woong Sub Byun', 'Minkyung Jin', 'Jinha Yu', 'Won Kyung Kim', 'Jayoung Song', 'Hwa-Jin Chung', 'Lak Shin Jeong', 'Sang Kook Lee']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Skp2 is associated with paclitaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells.', 'Caffeic acid phenethyl ester induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via regulation of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.', 'Targeting ribosomal S6 kinases/Y-box binding protein-1 signaling improves cellular sensitivity to taxane in prostate cancer.', 'Targeted nanomedicine modalities for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Emerging Roles of SKP2 in Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'Skp2-mediated MLKL degradation confers cisplatin-resistant in non-small cell lung cancer cells.', 'DHW-221, a Dual PI3K/mTOR Inhibitor, Overcomes Multidrug Resistance by Targeting P-Glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) and Akt-Mediated FOXO3a Nuclear Translocation in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'RIOK2 Inhibitor NSC139021 Exerts Anti-Tumor Effects on Glioblastoma via Inducing Skp2-Mediated Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis.', 'Synthesis of 4-Selenothreofuranose Derivatives via Pummerer-Type Reactions of trans-3,4-Dioxygenated Tetrahydroselenophenes Mediated by a Selenonium Intermediate.', 'Targeting the MYC Ubiquitination-Proteasome Degradation Pathway for Cancer Therapy.']"""

Included were questions relating to workforce planning, patient preparation, insertion procedure and verification methods. The survey was open from September 2016 to January 2017.  Results:   Results from 15 centres routinely inserting fiducial markers for prostate IGRT are presented. Eleven professional groups insert fiducial markers across the UK. Fourteen centres insert fiducial markers trans-rectally; one trans-perineally. Centres adopting a trans-rectal approach administer prophylactic ciprofloxacin as a single agent or combined with gentamicin or metronidazole; poor agreement between regimes presented. One centre has introduced targeted antibiotic prophylaxis. Five brands of fiducial markers are utilised nationally. Fourteen centres standardly insert three single fiducial markers, two common configurations emerged. Coupled fiducial markers are routinely implanted by one centre. All centres delay at least one week between fiducial marker insertion and planning CT; seven centres wait two weeks. The most common fiducial verification method is two-dimensional, paired kilo Voltage imaging.  Conclusion:   Variation in fiducial marker practice across the UK is considerable.

Here, we sought to evaluate if this targeted molecular surgical approach might be more effective than conventional salvage lymph node dissection (sLND). We prospectively analysed 42 consecutive patients who underwent sLND based on preoperative 68Gallium (68Ga)-PSMA-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging between 2015 and 2018. In 29 patients, the dissection field was based solely 68Ga-PSMA-PET imaging (conventional surgical approach [CSA]), whereas 13 patients underwent 99mTc-PSMA-RGS. Preoperative characteristics of both groups were similar. Final pathology revealed no metastases in nine CSA patients (31%), whereas all visible lesions on preoperative 68Ga-PSMA-PET were removed in patients who underwent RGS.

The apparent diffusion coefficient ADC, the diffusion coefficient D and the perfusion fraction f were calculated from IVIM DWI using a biexponential fit.  Results:   A total of 120 lymph nodes were detected on MRI. 95 of these were determined as benign and 25 as malignant. The average ADC was significantly lower in malignant compared to benign lymph nodes (0.88 × 10-³ vs 1.67 × 10-³ mm²/s, p < 0.001). Likewise, the average diffusion coefficient D was significantly lower in lymph node metastasis (0.54 × 10-³ vs 1.10 × 10-³ mm²/s, p < .001). The signal rate due to perfusion was significantly higher in malignant compared to benign nodes (33.4% vs. 27.1%, p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Applying biexponential IVIM MRI demonstrates significant differences in diffusion parameters ADC and D, as well as in the perfusion fraction f for benign and malignant lymph nodes. Therefore, IVIM might help to further improve the preoperative assessment of lymph nodes in MRI.""","""['Markus Sauer', 'Christiane Klene', 'Michael Kaul', 'Azien Quitzke', 'Maxim Avanesov', 'Cyrus Behzadi', 'Lars Budäus', 'Dirk Beyersdorff', 'Gerhard Adam', 'Marc Regier']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Role of quantitative intravoxel incoherent motion parameters in the preoperative diagnosis of nodal metastasis in patients with rectal carcinoma.', 'Lymph node metastasis in head and neck squamous carcinoma: Efficacy of intravoxel incoherent motion magnetic resonance imaging for the differential diagnosis.', 'Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) in evaluation of breast lesions: comparison with conventional DWI.', 'Perfusion-driven Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) MRI in Oncology: Applications, Challenges, and Future Trends.', 'Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Skeletal Muscle: Review and Future Directions.', 'Study on diagnostic value of quantitative parameters of intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) in prostate cancer.', 'The value of bi-exponential and non-Gaussian distribution diffusion-weighted imaging in the differentiation of recurrent soft tissue neoplasms and post-surgical changes.', 'Combinative evaluation of primary tumor and lymph nodes to predict pelvic lymphatic metastasis in cervical cancer: an integrated PET-IVIM MRI study.']"""

Most tumors progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and develop the neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype under androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The molecular basis for NE transdifferentiation after ADT remains incompletely understood. Herein, we show that an immunocyte expression protein, ZBTB46, induces inflammatory response gene expression and contributes to NE differentiation of prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated a molecular mechanism whereby ZBTB46 can be regulated by the androgen-responsive gene, SPDEF, and is associated with NE prostate cancer (NEPC) differentiation. In addition, ZBTB46 acts as a transcriptional coactivator that binds to the promoter of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (PTGS1) and transcriptionally regulated PTGS1 levels. Overexpression of ZBTB46 decreases the sensitivity of the combination of enzalutamide and a PTGS1 inhibitor; however, knockdown of ZBTB46 sensitizes the PTGS1 inhibitor and reduces tumor malignancy. ZBTB46 is inversely correlated with SPDEF and is increased in higher tumor grades and small-cell NE prostate cancer (SCNC) patients, which are positively associated with PTGS1. Our findings suggest that the induction of ZBTB46 results in increased PTGS1 expression, which is associated with NEPC progression and linked to the dysregulation of the AR-SPDEF pathway.""","""['Wei-Yu Chen', 'Tao Zeng', 'Yu-Chng Wen', 'Hsiu-Lien Yeh', 'Kuo-Ching Jiang', 'Wei-Hao Chen', 'Qingfu Zhang', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Yen-Nien Liu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Loss of SPDEF and gain of TGFBI activity after androgen deprivation therapy promote EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Promotes Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer and Neuroendocrine Differentiation by Activated ZBTB46.', 'ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6: Novel Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation upregulates SPINK1 expression and potentiates cellular plasticity in prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical Models of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'The nerve growth factor-delivered signals in prostate cancer and its associated microenvironment: when the dialogue replaces the monologue.', 'The Pleiotropic role, functions and targeted therapies of LIF/LIFR axis in cancer: Old spectacles with new insights.', 'Molecular mechanisms of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer progression.', 'Obesity-Associated Differentially Methylated Regions in Colon Cancer.', 'Aggressive variants of prostate cancer: underlying mechanisms of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation.']"""

The primary objective of this prospective phase 2 trial (NCT00450411) was to evaluate late gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse events (AEs) after salvage LDR brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   Eligible patients had low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer before EBRT and biopsy-proven recurrence >30 months after EBRT, with prostate-specific antigen levels <10 ng/mL and no regional/distant disease. The primary endpoint was grade 3 or higher late treatment-related gastrointestinal or genitourinary AEs occurring 9 to 24 months after brachytherapy. These AEs were projected to be ≤10%, with ≥20% considered unacceptable. All events were graded with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Multivariate analyses investigated associations of pretreatment or treatment variables with AEs.  Results:   One hundred patients from 20 centers were registered from May 2007 to January 2014. The 92 analyzable patients had a median follow-up of 54 months (range, 4-97) and a median age of 70 years (interquartile range [IQR], 65-74). The initial Gleason score was 7 in 48% of patients. The median dose of EBRT was 74 Gy (IQR, 70-76) at a median interval of 85 months previously (IQR, 60-119). Only 16% had androgen deprivation at study entry. Twelve patients (14%) had late grade 3 gastrointestinal/genitourinary AEs, with no treatment-related grade 4 or 5 AEs. No pretreatment variable predicted late AEs, including prior EBRT dose and elapsed interval. Higher V100 (percentage of prostate enclosed by prescription isodose) predicted both occurrence of late AEs (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.52; P = .03) and earlier time to first occurrence (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.34; P = .02).  Conclusions:   This prospective multicenter trial reports outcomes of salvage LDR brachytherapy for post-EBRT recurrence. The rate of late grade 3 AEs did not exceed the unacceptable threshold.

Methods:   Two hundred fifty-one men undergoing RP were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter (10), and proof-of-concept study in the United States. Fresh prostate samples were taken from known areas of cancer in the operating room immediately after RP. Samples were shipped and tested at a central laboratory. Utilizing the LPCP test, a suite of phenotypic biomarkers was analyzed and quantified using objective machine vision software. Biomarkers were objectively ranked via machine learning-derived statistical algorithms (MLDSA) to predict postsurgical adverse pathological features. Sensitivity and specificity were determined by comparing blinded predictions and unblinded RP surgical pathology reports, training MLDSAs on 70% of biopsy cells and testing MLDSAs on the remaining 30% of biopsy cells across the tested patient population.

We previously identified a population of castration-resistant luminal progenitor cells expressing Bmi1 in the normal mouse prostate that can serve as a cancer cell-of-origin. Here, we investigate the potential of Bmi1-expressing tumor cells that survive castration to initiate recurrence in vivo.  Methods:   We employed lineage retracing in Bmi1-CreER; R26R-confetti; Ptenf/f transgenic mice to mark and follow the fate of emerging recurrent tumor clones after castration. A tissue recombination strategy was used to rescue transgenic mouse prostates by regeneration as grafts in immunodeficient hosts. We also used a small molecule Bmi1 inhibitor, PTC-209, to directly test the role of Bmi1 in recurrence.  Results:   Transgenic prostate tumors (n = 17) regressed upon castration but uniformly recurred within 3 months. Residual regressed tumor lesions exhibited a transient luminal-to-basal phenotypic switch and marked cellular heterogeneity. Additionally, in these lesions, a subpopulation of Bmi1-expressing castration-resistant tumor cells overexpressed the stem cell reprogramming factor Sox2 (mean [SD] = 41.1 [3.8]%, n = 10, P < .001). Bmi1+Sox2+ cells were quiescent (BrdU+Bmi1+Sox2+ at 3.4 [1.5]% vs BrdU+Bmi1+Sox2- at 18.8 [3.4]%, n = 10, P = .009), consistent with a cancer stem cell phenotype. By lineage retracing, we established that recurrence emerges from the Bmi1+ tumor cells in regressed tumors. Furthermore, treatment with the small molecule Bmi1 inhibitor PTC-209 reduced Bmi1+Sox2+ cells (6.1 [1.4]% PTC-209 vs 38.8 [2.3]% vehicle, n = 10, P < .001) and potently suppressed recurrence (retraced clone size = 2.6 [0.5] PTC-209 vs 15.7 [5.9] vehicle, n = 12, P = .04).  Conclusions:   These results illustrate the utility of lineage retracing to define the cellular origins of recurrent prostate cancer and identify Bmi1+Sox2+ cells as a source of recurrence that could be targeted therapeutically.""","""['Young A Yoo', 'Rajita Vatapalli', 'Barbara Lysy', 'Hanlin Mok', 'Mohamed M Desouki', 'Sarki A Abdulkadir']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Strategies to Identify and Target Cells of Origin in Prostate Cancer.', 'Bmi1 marks distinct castration-resistant luminal progenitor cells competent for prostate regeneration and tumour initiation.', 'Aberrantly elevated Bmi1 promotes cervical cancer tumorigenicity and tumor sphere formation via enhanced transcriptional regulation of Sox2 genes.', 'A rare castration-resistant progenitor cell population is highly enriched in Pten-null prostate tumours.', 'Yin Yang 1 is associated with cancer stem cell transcription factors (SOX2, OCT4, BMI1) and clinical implication.', 'Role of BMI1, a stem cell factor, in cancer recurrence and chemoresistance: preclinical and clinical evidences.', 'Hairy gene homolog increases nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell stemness by upregulating Bmi-1.', 'Immune mechanisms shape the clonal landscape during early progression of prostate cancer.', 'SOX2 inhibits LLGL2 polarity protein in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via miRNA-142-3p.', 'The driver role of JAK-STAT signalling in cancer stemness capabilities leading to new therapeutic strategies for therapy- and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Crucial Roles of Bmi-1 in Cancer: Implications in Pathogenesis, Metastasis, Drug Resistance, and Targeted Therapies.']"""

Objective:   We compared 2 programs implementing PtDAs for men with localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   This was a comparative case study. Case 1 was a hospital prostate pathway and case 2 was a provincial prostate pathway with 2 locations (2a, 2b). Nurses provided the men with PtDAs and answered questions. Data sources were as follows: (a) 2 years administrative data for men with localized prostate cancer, (b) clinicians survey and interviews, and (c) patients/spouses interviews. Analysis was within and across cases.  Results:   The PtDA was used with 23% of men in case 1 (95% confidence interval, 19.8%-26.1%) and 98% of men in case 2a (95% confidence interval, 96.5%-99.8%). The pathway was not implemented in case 2b. Men given the PtDA had positive experiences. Many clinicians supported the use of PtDAs, some adapted their discussions with patients, and others did not support the use of PtDAs. To increase use in case 1, participants identified needing a Canadian PtDA available electronically and endorsed by all clinicians. In case 2b, the provincial prostate pathway needed to be implemented.  Conclusions:   There was variable uptake of the PtDAs between the cases. Men who received the PtDA had positive outcomes.

Thus, we conducted a national survey of radiation oncologists (ROs) and urologists (UROs) to elucidate perceived barriers to AS for low-risk PCa.  Methods:   In 2017, we undertook a four-wave mail survey of 1855 ROs and UROs. The survey instrument assessed attitudes about possible barriers towards AS for low-risk PCa. We used Pearson Chi square and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify physician characteristics associated with attitudes about AS.  Results:   We received 691 completed surveys for an overall response rate of 37.3%. A majority of respondents indicated that they felt comfortable recommending AS (90.0%), agreed that high-level evidence supports it (82.3%), and considered AS equally effective for survival compared with surgery and radiation therapy (84.4%). UROs were less likely to agree that patients were not interested in AS for low-risk PCa compared with ROs (16.5 vs. 48.9%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.18, p < 0.001). Similarly, UROs were less likely to concur patients avoid AS because of repeat prostate biopsies than ROs (36.3 vs. 55.4%; adjusted OR 0.41, p < 0.001).

In addition, we used the shRNA lentiviral vector to inhibit the PLD1 mRNA expression and observed its effect on LNCaP cell proliferation after AIPC transition by using MTS method. The results showed that the expression level of PLD1 mRNA was increased by 373-fold after AIPC transition (P<0.05); the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-related gene expression was also elevated (P<0.05); the growth rate of LNCaP cells that had transited to androgen independence was reduced by about 30% when the PLD1 mRNA expression was inhibited by the shRNA lentivirus as compared with the negative control group (P<0.05).

Patients and methods:   Brachytherapy DE caused by AuNPs is investigated using two methods, namely 192Ir and eBx™ Brachytherapy. The second method, which was recently introduced clinically, operates at ~50 kV, which is also the optimal beam energy for DE. In this in vitro study, two cancer cell lines, lung (A549) and prostate (DU145), were used. Cells were incubated with 1 mM (2% w/w) concentration of AuNPs of ~15 nm in size. The control groups were exposed to a range of doses from 0 (control) to 6 Gy, with eBx™ and 192Ir sources separately. A clonogenic assay was conducted to determine cell survival curves.  Results:   High dose enhancement factor (DEF) values were achieved in treated groups with low concentration of AuNPs with the 50 kV energy associated with the eBx™. The DE levels in eBx™ for Du145 and A549 cells were found to be 2.90 and 2.06, respectively. The results showed DEFs measured for the same cell lines using 192Ir brachytherapy to be 1.67 and 1.54 for Du145 and A549 cancer cells, respectively. This clearly indicates that much higher DE values are obtained in the case of eBx™ X-ray brachytherapy compared to 192Ir gamma brachytherapy.  Conclusion:   The higher DE values obtained with eBx™ compared to 192Ir brachytherapy can be attributed to the lower average energy of the former and being closer to the optimal energy for DE. This could potentially be utilized by medical practitioners and clinicians to achieve the same tumor control with a significantly lower dose from the eBx™ compared to the 192Ir brachytherapy treatment, thus bringing huge benefits to the brachytherapy-treated patients.""","""['Elham Shahhoseini', 'Prabhakar Ramachandran', 'William Roy Patterson', 'Moshi Geso']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Effect of Gold Nanoparticle Radiosensitization on Plasmid DNA Damage Induced by High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy.', 'Measurement of dose enhancement factor for Xoft Axxent electronic brachytherapy device using nanoparticle-embedded alginate film and radiochromic film.', 'Investigation of the effects of cell model and subcellular location of gold nanoparticles on nuclear dose enhancement factors using Monte Carlo simulation.', 'Xoft Axxent electronic brachytherapy: a new device for delivering brachytherapy to the breast.', 'Intraoperative Radiotherapy with Balloon-Based Electronic Brachytherapy System-A Systematic Review and First Bulgarian Experience in Breast Cancer Patients.', 'Natural Baicalein-Rich Fraction as Radiosensitizer in Combination with Bismuth Oxide Nanoparticles and Cisplatin for Clinical Radiotherapy.', 'Breast radiotherapy with kilovoltage photons and gold nanoparticles as radiosensitizer: An in vitro study.', 'Effect of Gold Nanoparticle Radiosensitization on Plasmid DNA Damage Induced by High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy.', 'Synergetic Influence of Bismuth Oxide Nanoparticles, Cisplatin and Baicalein-Rich Fraction on Reactive Oxygen Species Generation and Radiosensitization Effects for Clinical Radiotherapy Beams.', 'Surface stress-induced membrane biosensor based on double-layer stable gold nanostructures for E. coli detection.']"""

Objective:   To assess whether germline mutations are associated with grade reclassification (GR) in patients undergoing active surveillance (AS).  Design, setting, and participants:   Two independent cohorts of PCa patients undergoing AS; 882 and 329 patients from Johns Hopkins and North Shore, respectively.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Germline DNA was sequenced for DNA repair genes, including BRCA1/2 and ATM (three-gene panel). Pathogenicity of mutations was defined according to the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Association of mutation carrier status and GR was evaluated by a competing risk analysis.  Results and limitations:   Of 1211, 289 patients experienced GR; 11 of 26 with mutations in a three-gene panel and 278 of 1185 noncarriers; adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.004-3.84, p=0.04). Reclassification occurred in six of 11 carriers of BRCA2 mutations and 283 of 1200 noncarriers; adjusted HR=2.74 (95% CI=1.26-5.96, p=0.01). The carrier rates of pathogenic mutations in the three-gene panel, and BRCA2 alone, were significantly higher in those reclassified (3.8% and 2.1%, respectively) than in those not reclassified (1.6% and 0.5%, respectively; p=0.04 and 0.03, respectively). Carrier rates for BRCA2 were greater for those reclassified from Gleason score (GS) 3+3 at diagnosis to GS ≥4+3 (4.1% vs 0.7%, p=0.01) versus GS 3+4 (2.1% vs 0.6%; p=0.03). Results are limited by the small number of mutation carriers and an intermediate end point.  Conclusions:   Mutation status of BRCA1/2 and ATM is associated with GR among men undergoing AS.

Genes expressed only in cancer tissue may be useful biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. The aims of the present study were to analyse regulator of calcineurin 2 (RCAN2) in a large number of GCs, and to investigate how these expression patterns correlate with clinicopathological parameters and various markers.  Methods and results:   An immunohistochemical analysis of RCAN2 in 207 GC tissue samples showed that 110 (53%) GCs were positive for RCAN2. RCAN2-positive GCs were more advanced in terms of TNM classification and tumour stage than RCAN2-negative GCs. Furthermore, RCAN2 was an independent prognostic classifier for GC patients. The cell growth and invasiveness of RCAN2 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected GC cell lines were less than those of the negative control siRNA-transfected cell lines, whereas those of RCAN2-transfected cells were significantly increased as compared with those of empty vector-transfected cells.

This system integrates with our treatment planning system (TPS), Linacs recording and verification system (R&V), and CBCT imaging system, consisting of three modules: Treatment Schedule Monitoring module (TSM), pseudo-CT Generating module (PCG), and Treatment Dose Reconstruction/evaluation module (TDR). TSM watches the treatment progress in the R&V system and triggers the PCG module when new CBCT is available. PCG retrieves the CBCTs and performs planning CT to CBCT deformable registration (DIR) to generate pseudo-CT. The 4D-CBCT images are taken for target localization and correction in lung cancer patient before treatment. To take full advantage of the valuable information carried by 4D-CBCT, a novel phase-matching DIR scheme was developed to generate 4D pseudo-CT images for 4D dose reconstruction. Finally, TDR module creates TPS scripts to automate Tx-Dose calculation on the pseudo-CT images. Both initial quantitative commissioning and patient-specific qualitative quality assurance of the DIR tool were utilized to ensure the DIR quality. The treatment doses of ten patients (six SBRT-lung, two head and neck (HN), one breast and one prostate cancer patients) were retrospectively constructed and evaluated. The target registration error (mean ± STD: 1.05 ± 1.13 mm) of the DIR tool is comparable to the interobserver uncertainty (0.88 ± 1.31 mm) evaluated by a publically available lung-landmarks dataset. For lung SBRT patients, the D99 of the final cumulative Tx-Dose of GTV is 93.8 ± 5.5% (83.7-100.1%) of the originally planned D99 . CTV D99 decreases by 3% and mean ipsilateral parotid dose increases by 11.5% for one of the two HN patients.

However, such studies suffer from residual confounding (due to unmeasured or imprecisely measured confounders), undermining causal inference. Mendelian randomization uses randomly assigned (hence unconfounded and pre-disease onset) germline genetic variation to proxy for phenotypes and strengthen causal inference in observational studies. We tested the hypothesis that serum calcium is associated with an increased risk of overall and advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   A genetic instrument was constructed using five single-nucleotide polymorphisms robustly associated with serum calcium in a genome-wide association study (n ≤ 61,079). This instrument was then used to test the effect of a 0.5 mg/dL increase (1 standard deviation, SD) in serum calcium on risk of prostate cancer in 72,729 men in the PRACTICAL (Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome) Consortium (44,825 cases, 27,904 controls) and risk of advanced prostate cancer in 33,498 men (6,263 cases, 27,235 controls).

Acting as a bypass mechanism, GR activates AR-regulated genes, although GR-target genes contributing to PCa therapy resistance remain to be identified. Emerging evidence also shows that African American (AA) men, who disproportionately develop aggressive PCa, have hypersensitive GR signaling linked to cumulative stressful life events. Using racially diverse PCa cell lines (MDA-PCa-2b, 22Rv1, PC3, and DU145) we examined the effects of glucocorticoids on the expression of two stress oncoproteins associated with PCa therapy resistance, Clusterin (CLU) and Lens Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor p75 (LEDGF/p75). We observed that glucocorticoids upregulated LEDGF/p75 and CLU in PCa cells. Blockade of GR activation abolished this upregulation. We also detected increased GR transcript expression in AA PCa tissues, compared to European American (EA) tissues, using Oncomine microarray datasets.

The number of M2 macrophages in the airway correlates with asthma severity in humans. Sex differences in asthma suggest that sex hormones modify lung inflammation and macrophage polarization. Asthmatic women have more M2 macrophages than asthmatic men and androgens have been used as an experimental asthma treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that although androgen (dihydrotestosterone) reconstitution of castrated mice reduced lung inflammation in a mouse model of allergic lung inflammation, it enhanced M2 polarization of AM. This indicates a cell-specific role for androgens. Dihydrotestosterone also enhanced IL-4-stimulated M2 macrophage polarization in vitro. Using mice lacking androgen receptor (AR) in monocytes/macrophages (ARfloxLysMCre), we found that male but not female mice exhibited less eosinophil recruitment and lung inflammation due to impaired M2 polarization. There was a reduction in eosinophil-recruiting chemokines and IL-5 in AR-deficient AM. These data reveal an unexpected and novel role for androgen/AR in promoting M2 macrophage polarization. Our findings are also important for understanding pathology in diseases promoted by M2 macrophages and androgens, such as asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis, and prostate cancer, and for designing new approaches to treatment.""","""['Mireya Becerra-Díaz', 'Ashley B Strickland', 'Aleksander Keselman', 'Nicola M Heller']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Immunol""","""['ATP/P2X7r axis mediates the pathological process of allergic asthma by inducing M2 polarization of alveolar macrophages.', 'Estrogen Signaling Contributes to Sex Differences in Macrophage Polarization during Asthma.', 'The transcription factor PU.1 promotes alternative macrophage polarization and asthmatic airway inflammation.', 'Androgen and Androgen Receptors as Regulators of Monocyte and Macrophage Biology in the Healthy and Diseased Lung.', 'Macrophages in allergic asthma: fine-tuning their pro- and anti-inflammatory actions for disease resolution.', 'Gender-Specific Impact of Sex Hormones on the Immune System.', 'Case report: Mafb promoter activity may define the alveolar macrophage dichotomy.', 'Selective androgen receptor modulator microparticle formulation reverses muscle hyperalgesia in a mouse model of widespread muscle pain.', 'Sex-the most underappreciated variable in research: insights from helminth-infected hosts.', 'S-nitrosylation of CSF1 receptor increases the efficacy of CSF1R blockage against prostate cancer.']"""

Androgen signaling also impacts DNA damage signaling through mechanisms involving gene expression and transcription-associated DNA damaging events. Defining the contributions of androgen signaling to DNA repair is important for understanding androgen receptor function, and it also has translational implications.  Methods:   We generated RNA-seq data from multiple prostate cancer lines and used bioinformatic analyses to characterize androgen-regulated gene expression. We compared the results from cell lines with gene expression data from prostate cancer xenografts, and patient samples, to query how androgen signaling and prostate cancer progression influences the expression of DNA repair genes. We performed whole genome sequencing to help characterize the status of the DNA repair machinery in widely used prostate cancer lines. Finally, we tested a DNA repair enzyme inhibitor for effects on androgen-dependent transcription.  Results:   Our data indicates that androgen signaling regulates a subset of DNA repair genes that are largely specific to the respective model system and disease state. We identified deleterious mutations in the DNA repair genes RAD50 and CHEK2. We found that inhibition of the DNA repair enzyme MRE11 with the small molecule mirin inhibits androgen-dependent transcription and growth of prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Our data supports the view that crosstalk between androgen signaling and DNA repair occurs at multiple levels, and that DNA repair enzymes in addition to PARPs, could be actionable targets in prostate cancer.""","""['Kasey Jividen', 'Katarzyna Z Kedzierska', 'Chun-Song Yang', 'Karol Szlachta', 'Aakrosh Ratan', 'Bryce M Paschal']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['HOXC8 inhibits androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells by inhibiting SRC-3 recruitment to direct androgen target genes.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'FOXP1 is an androgen-responsive transcription factor that negatively regulates androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'DNA Damage Repair Pathways in Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review of Molecular Mechanisms, Emerging Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Precision Oncology.', 'Induction of PARP7 Creates a Vulnerability for Growth Inhibition by RBN2397 in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Development and validation of a tumor immune cell infiltration-related gene signature for recurrence prediction by weighted gene co-expression network analysis in prostate cancer.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.', 'DNA Repair Mechanisms, Protein Interactions and Therapeutic Targeting of the MRN Complex.']"""

The control group was composed of patients who underwent NS-RARP at our institution without the application of ChiMe from January 2015. The patients were further classified into two groups based on the amount of nerves spared: Group A, comprised patients who underwent a monolateral or bilateral full NS; Group B, comprised patients in which a full NS was not performed. The demographics, peri- and postoperative data, and complications were recorded and compared. Potency recovery was recorded for Group A vs Group B in both the ChiMe and the control groups.  Results:   In all, 136 patients were enrolled in the ChiMe group and 334 patients in the control group. There were no differences between groups in terms of baseline variables. Based on the amount of nerves preserved, 183 patients were included in Group A and 287 in Group B. Odds ratios at different time points showed that the only two factors influencing potency recovery were the amount of nerves preserved (Group A vs Group B) and the application or not of ChiMe on the NVBs spared.

The impact of laser power (10-125 W), pulse duration (100 ns and 100 µs) and pulse frequency (10 and 100 Hz) on tissue ablation and coagulation rates and sizes was explored.  Results:   Good agreement between the computational model and analytical and experimental results was found. Continuous-wave laser results in 13% less coagulation zone thickness and 10% higher ablation rate than the low frequency pulsed laser. With increasing laser power; ablation rate is expected to increase linearly, while coagulation zone thickness is expected to increase asymptotically. Pulse frequency influence on tissue ablation and coagulation is relevant at high power, but pulse duration is found to have minimal effect at all powers.  Conclusions:   Laser thermal tissue ablation employing continuous wave mode lasers outperforms that employing pulsed mode lasers. Laser power settings should be carefully selected to maximize the rate of tissue ablation and minimize tissue coagulation.""","""['Hossam Elkhalil', 'Aiman Alshare', 'Gal Shafirstein', 'John Bischof']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Hyperthermia""","""['The Comparison of Thermal Effects of a 1940-nm Tm:fiber Laser and 980-nm Diode Laser on Cortical Tissue: Stereotaxic Laser Brain Surgery.', 'In vitro investigation of wavelength-dependent tissue ablation: laser prostatectomy between 532 nm and 2.01 microm.', 'Predicting clinical efficacy of photoangiolytic and cutting/ablating lasers using the chick chorioallantoic membrane model: implications for endoscopic voice surgery.', 'Laser therapy for benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Photoselective vaporization of the prostate for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Transient simulation of laser ablation based on Monte Carlo light transport with dynamic optical properties model.', 'Picosecond Laser-Induced Photothermal Skin Damage Evaluation by Computational Clinical Trial.']"""

While conventional oncology focuses on targeted medicine, research on LCS101 adopts a multi-targeted approach, examining its preclinical (in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo) and clinical (randomized controlled trial, pragmatic) effects. This includes examining the formula's impact on the immune system, selective anticancer effects, and improved chemotherapy-related symptoms and quality of life. Effects on the Immune System: In murine splenic cell cultures, LCS101 significantly increased T-cell proliferation and macrophage tumor necrosis factor-α production. Blood samples from healthy volunteers exposed to LCS101 showed a dose-dependent increase in natural killer cell activity; and a randomized controlled trial showed significantly lower rates of leucopenia/neutropenia and anemia in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Selective Anticancer Effects: In vitro LCS101 demonstrated selective growth inhibition (on XTT viability assay) in human breast and prostate cancer cell lines, without any harmful effects on normal human epithelial cells. The anticancer effects were attributed to reactive oxygen species activity. Cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil on breast cancer cell lines were significantly increased following exposure to LCS101, with a protective effect in normal cells. Symptom Relief and Quality of Life: Clinical research shows that patients taking LCS101 during chemotherapy are less likely to report symptoms such as fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting.  Conclusion:   LCS101 exhibits multi-targeted effects, with significant implications for cancer care. Further research is needed to better understand the impact of these findings.""","""['Yair Maimon', 'Noah Samuels', 'Zoya Cohen', 'Raanan Berger', 'David S Rosenthal']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Integr Cancer Ther""","""['Selective anticancer effects and protection from chemotherapy by the botanical compound LCS101: Implications for cancer treatment.', 'Effect of the botanical formula LCS101 on the anti-cancer effects of radiation therapy.', 'A prospective, controlled study of the botanical compound mixture LCS101 for chemotherapy-induced hematological complications in breast cancer.', 'Primary prophylactic colony-stimulating factors for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in breast cancer patients.', 'Targeting of cytotoxic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs to breast, ovarian, endometrial, and prostate cancers.', 'BK002 Induces miR-192-5p-Mediated Apoptosis in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells via Modulation of PI3K/CHOP.', 'Exploring Herbal Medicine Use during Palliative Cancer Care: The Integrative Physician as a Facilitator of Pharmacist-Patient-Oncologist Communication.']"""

In the current study, we detected the expression and regulatory relationship between miR-10a and Lysine-specific demethylase 4A (KDM4A) to reveal their function in prostate cancer (PCa) progression. We found that miR-10a levels were significantly decreased in PCa cell lines in comparison with the normal epithelial cell line RWPE-1. Downregulation of miR-10a levels was also observed in tumor tissues from PCa patients compared with the adjacent normal tissues. Enhanced expression of miR-10a inhibited cell proliferation and colony forming capability of PCa cells. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis showed a significant decrease of KDM4A in response to miR-10a elevation in PCa cells. Using dual luciferase assay, we confirmed that KDM4A was a target gene for miR-10a. Furthermore, Western blot analysis indicated that miR-10a overexpression inactivated YAP signaling and suppressed transcription of YAP target genes. Additionally, cell growth arrest and colony forming capacity inhibition induced by miR-10a overexpression could be reversed by YAP overexpression in PCa cells. More importantly, miR-10a mimics inhibited PC-3 tumor growth in nude mice accompanied with a remarkable reduction of KDM4A and YAP expression. In conclusion, our results uncovered a tumor suppressor role of miR-10a in PCa via negative regulation of KDM4A and its downstream Hippo-YAP pathway.""","""['Haiqi Mu', 'Luxia Xiang', 'Shaoxun Li', 'Dapang Rao', 'Shuaibin Wang', 'Kaiyuan Yu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Circ_SPECC1 enhances the inhibition of miR-526b on downstream KDM4A/YAP1 pathway to regulate the growth and invasion of gastric cancer cells.', 'Histone demethylase JMJD2A drives prostate tumorigenesis through transcription factor ETV1.', 'LncRNA MALAT1/miR-181a-5p affects the proliferation and adhesion of myeloma cells via regulation of Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.', 'ETS transcription factor ERG cooperates with histone demethylase KDM4A.', 'Regulation and methylation of tumor suppressor miR-124 by androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cantharidin Inhibits Proliferation of Liver Cancer by Inducing DNA Damage via KDM4A-Dependent Histone H3K36 Demethylation.', 'Transcriptomic and Drug Discovery Analyses Reveal Natural Compounds Targeting the KDM4 Subfamily as Promising Adjuvant Treatments in Cancer.', 'Analysis of m6A-Related lncRNAs for Prognosis Value and Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'TCF21 regulates miR-10a-5p/LIN28B signaling to block the proliferation and invasion of melanoma cells.']"""

Quantification of 14C per cell prior to injection into animals, and quantification of 14C in whole organs allows us to extrapolate the number of cancer cells available to initiate metastatic tumors. The 14C labeling was optimized such that 1 cancer cell was detected among 1 million normal cells. We show that ~1-5% of human cancer cells injected into immunodeficient mice form subcutaneous tumors, and even fewer cells initiate metastatic tumors. Comparisons of metastatic site colonization between a highly metastatic (PC3) and a non-metastatic (LnCap) cell line showed that PC3 cells colonize target tissues in greater quantities at 2 weeks post-delivery, and by 12 weeks post-delivery no 14C was detected in LnCap xenografts, suggesting that all metastatic cells were cleared. The 14C-signal correlated with the presence and the severity of metastatic tumors. AMS measurements of 14C-labeled cells provides a highly-sensitive, quantitative assay to experimentally evaluate metastasis and colonization of target tissues in xenograft mouse models.

The presence or absence of androgen receptor (AR) splice variants, AR-V7 and ARv567es, in mCRPC patient circulating tumor cells (CTC) may be associated with taxane treatment outcomes.Experimental Design: A novel digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) assay assessed AR-splice variant expression in CTCs from patients receiving docetaxel or cabazitaxel in TAXYNERGY (NCT01718353). Patient outcomes were examined according to AR-splice variant expression, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA)50 response and progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   Of the 54 evaluable patients, 36 (67%) were AR-V7+, 42 (78%) were ARv567es+, 29 (54%) were double positive, and 5 (9%) were double negative. PSA50 response rates at any time were numerically higher for AR-V7- versus AR-V7+ (78% vs. 58%; P = 0.23) and for ARv567es- versus ARv567es+ (92% vs. 57%; P = 0.04) patients. When AR-V mRNA status was correlated with change in nuclear AR from cycle 1 day 1 to day 8 (n = 24), AR-V7+ patients (n = 16) had a 0.4% decrease versus a 12.9% and 26.7% decrease in AR-V7-/ARv567es- (n = 3) and AR-V7-/ARv567es+ (n = 5) patients, respectively, suggesting a dominant role for AR-V7 over ARv567es. Median PFS was 12.02 versus 8.48 months for AR-V7- versus AR-V7+ (HR = 0.38; P = 0.01), and 12.71 versus 7.29 months for ARv567es- versus ARv567es+ (HR = 0.37; P = 0.02). For AR-V7+, AR-V7-/ARv567es+, and AR-V7-/ARv567es- patients, median PFS was 8.48, 11.17, and 16.62 months, respectively (P = 0.0013 for trend).  Conclusions:   Although detection of both CTC-specific AR-V7 and ARv567es by ddPCR influenced taxane outcomes, AR-V7 primarily mediated the prognostic impact.

The goal of this study was to develop a tumor-specific optical probe for real-time fluorescence-guided surgery.  Experimental design:   A humanized antibody fragment against PSCA (A11 minibody, A11 Mb) was conjugated with a near-infrared fluorophore, IRDye800CW. The integrity and binding of the probe to PSCA were confirmed by gel electrophoresis, size-exclusion chromatography, and flow cytometry, respectively. The ability of the probe to detect tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes and metastatic lesions was evaluated in 2 xenograft models, as well as in transgenic mice expressing human PSCA (hPSCA). An invasive intramuscular model was utilized to evaluate the efficacy of the A11 Mb-IRDye800CW-guided surgery.  Results:   A11 Mb was successfully conjugated with IRDye800CW and retained specific binding to PSCA. In vivo imaging showed maximal signal-to-background ratios at 48 hours. The A11 Mb-IRDye800CW specifically detected PSCA-positive primary tumors, tumor-infiltrated lymph nodes, and distant metastases with high contrast. Fluorescence guidance facilitated more complete tumor resection, reduced tumor recurrence, and improved overall survival, compared with conventional white light surgery. The probe successfully identified primary orthotopic tumors and metastatic lesions in hPSCA transgenic mice.  Conclusions:   Real-time fluorescence image-guided surgery with A11 Mb-IRDye800CW enabled detection of lymph node metastases and positive surgical margins, facilitated more complete tumor removal, and improved survival, compared with white light surgery.

Our aim was to investigate the current opinion on FT in the European urological community.  Methods:   A 25-item questionnaire was devised according to the Cherries checklist and distributed through SurveyMonkey using a web link from November 2016 to October 2017. After a pilot validation (n = 40 urologists), the survey was sent through EAU and 9 other national European urological societies mailing list. Twitter was also used.  Results:   We received 484 replies from 51 countries. Almost half (44.8%, n = 217) stated FT would represent a step forward, and 52.0% (n = 252) would suggest FT to a patient. Almost three-quarters (70.8%, n = 343) agreed FT will become a standard option after improvements in patient selection (n = 66) or when its effectiveness will be proven (n = 78), or both (n = 199). Most frequently used definition of FT was treatment of all significant (life-threatening) cancer foci whilst leaving untreated the rest of the gland (39.3%, n = 190). FT use was considered as an alternative to whole-gland treatments by 29.7% (n = 144), and to AS by 25.0% (n = 121). On multivariate analysis, FT availability and publications were associated with a positive opinion on FT. Conversely, attending International congresses, treating high PCa volumes and high percentages of high-risk PCa was associated with a negative opinion.  Conclusions:   FT is considered as an attractive option for PCa treatment by the European urological community sampled by our survey. FT availability positively influences these thoughts.

Observational studies suggest that physical activity may lower the risk of aggressive PCa. To our knowledge, the association between physical activity and PCa defined by TMPRSS2:ERG has not been evaluated.  Objective:   To prospectively examine the association between physical activity and risk of PCa defined by clinical features and TMPRSS2:ERG.  Design, setting, and participants:   We studied 49160 men aged 40-75 yr in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study from 1986 to 2012. Data was collected at baseline and every 2 yr with >90% follow-up. Total and vigorous physical activity were measured in metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-h/wk.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   Advanced PCa was defined as stage T3b, T4, N1, or M1 at diagnosis and lethal PCa as distant metastases or death due to disease over follow-up. Presence of TMPRSS2:ERG was estimated by immunohistochemistry of ERG protein expression. Cox proportional hazards models were used to obtain multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incidence of subtype-specific PCa.  Results and limitations:   During 26 yr of follow-up, 6411 developed PCa overall and 888 developed lethal disease. There were no significant associations between total physical activity and risk of PCa in the overall cohort. In multivariable-adjusted models, men in the highest quintile of vigorous activity had a significant 30% lower risk of advanced PCa (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.53-0.92) and 25% lower risk of lethal PCa (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.94) than men in the lowest quintile of vigorous activity. The association was independent of screening history. Vigorous activity was not associated with total PCa in the overall cohort but was inversely associated among highly screened men (top vs bottom quintile, HR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97). Of all cases, 945 were assayed for ERG (48% ERG-positive). Men with higher vigorous activity had a lower risk of ERG-positive PCa (top vs bottom quintile, HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.52-0.97). There was no significant association with the risk of ERG-negative disease (p heterogeneity=0.09).  Conclusions:   Our study confirms that vigorous physical activity is associated with lower risk of advanced and lethal PCa and provides novel evidence for a lower risk of TMPRSS2:ERG-positive disease.  Patient summary:   The identification of modifiable lifestyle factors for prevention of clinically important prostate cancer (PCa) is needed.

However, SLND may be associated with intra- and postoperative complications, and the oncological benefit may be limited to specific groups of patients.  Objective:   To identify the optimal candidates for SLND based on preoperative characteristics.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 654 patients who experienced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise and nodal recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) and underwent SLND at nine tertiary referral centers. Lymph node recurrence was documented by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan using either 11C-choline or 68Ga-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand.  Intervention:   SLND.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The study outcome was early clinical recurrence (eCR) developed within 1 yr after SLND. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to develop a predictive model. Multivariable-derived coefficients were used to develop a novel risk calculator. Decision-curve analysis was used to evaluate the net benefit of the predictive model.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up was 30 (interquartile range, 16-50) mo among patients without clinical recurrence (CR), and 334 patients developed CR after SLND. In particular, eCR at 1 yr after SLND was observed in 150 patients, with a Kaplan-Meier probability of eCR equal to 25%. The development of eCR was significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer-specific mortality at 3 yr, being 20% versus 1.4% in patients with and without eCR, respectively (p<0.0001). At multivariable analysis, Gleason grade group 5 (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.04; p<0.0001), time from RP to PSA rising (HR: 0.99; p=0.025), hormonal therapy administration at PSA rising after RP (HR: 1.47; p=0.0005), retroperitoneal uptake at PET/CT scan (HR: 1.24; p=0.038), three or more positive spots at PET/CT scan (HR: 1.26; p=0.019), and PSA level at SLND (HR: 1.05; p<0.0001) were significant predictors of CR after SLND. The coefficients of the predictive model were used to develop a risk calculator for eCR at 1 yr after SLND. The discrimination of the model (Harrel'sC index) was 0.75. At decision-curve analysis, the net benefit of the model was higher than the ""treat-all"" option at all the threshold probabilities.  Conclusions:   We reported the largest available series of patients treated with SLND. Roughly 25% of men developed eCR after surgery. We developed the first risk stratification tool to identify the optimal candidate to SLND based on routinely available preoperative characteristics. This tool can be useful to avoid use of SLND in men more likely to progress despite any imaging-guided approach.

DAB2IP and SPRY2 are regulatory elements, which act as feedback inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases signaling in mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These elements have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of cancer. Therefore, this study is aimed to investigate the expression of all known splice variants of DAB2IP and SPRY2 in prostate tissue. Fresh Prostate tissue samples (50 prostate cancer/ matched normal tissue and 30 BPH) were collected and total RNA was extracted followed by cDNA synthesis. The expression of DAB2IP and SPRY2 transcript variants were evaluated using RT-PCR and quantitative Real-time PCR. The results indicated significant down-regulation of DAB2IP transcript variant 1 in cancerous tissues compared to paired normal tissues (P = 0.001) as well as SPRY2 transcript variant 2 in cancerous tissues in comparison with the normal counterparts and BPH (P = 0.008 and P = 0.025, respectively). In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between DAB2IP.1 and SPRY2.2 expression with PSA levels in prostate cancer (P = 0.039 ρ =-0.24 and P = 0.045 ρ =-0.3, respectively). Interestingly, the down-regulation of DAB2IP.1 mRNA and SPRY2.2 mRNA was positively correlated in tumor samples (P = 0.002 ρ = 0.434). For the first time, this experiment highlights the deregulation of DAB2IP and SPRY2 transcript variants in human prostate cancer.

Moreover, androgen receptor (AR) has been well defined to play an important role in lethal PCa aggressiveness from androgen-responsive to castration-resistant status. In this study, we showed that the quality-assured Ganoderma tsugae ethanol extract (GTEE), a Chinese natural and herbal product, significantly inhibited expression of SREBP-1 and its downstream genes associated with lipogenesis in PCa cells. Through inhibiting SREBP-1, GTEE reduced the levels of intracellular fatty acids and lipids in PCa cells. Importantly, GTEE also downregulated the expression of AR and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in both androgen-responsive and castration-resistant PCa cells. By blocking the SREBP-1/AR axis, GTEE suppressed cell growth and progressive behaviors, as well as activating the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway in PCa cells.

This randomized phase 2 trial aimed to assess the activity of weekly docetaxel with radiation therapy (RT) plus androgen deprivation in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer. The study examined the benefit of 9 weekly docetaxel administrations to RT plus 3 years of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues.  Methods and materials:   A total of 132 patients were recruited for the study. Patients' characteristics included T3-T4 stage (81.1%), Gleason score ≥8 (77.3%), prostate-specific antigen level >20 ng/mL (28.9%), and pN+ (18.2%). All patients included in the trial received either the standard-of-care control arm with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues plus RT (arm A) or the experimental arm (RT + 9 weekly cycles of docetaxel + 3 years of androgen deprivation therapy, arm B). The primary objective was to achieve a high percentage of patients who were free of biochemical recurrence within 5 years of randomization. Secondary endpoints included biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), clinical response rate, biochemical response rate, and toxicity.  Results:   No difference between the arms of the study was found in biochemical recurrence (93.4% at 60 months for arm A vs 85.3% for arm B; P = .3297). PFS at 60 months was 93.4% and 83.7% in arms A and B, respectively (P = .2532).

Patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2000 to 2008 with followup through May 2016. Clinical, pathological and demographic variables were compared by Agent Orange exposure. Associations of Agent Orange with overall survival, skeletal related events and cancer specific survival were performed using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models after IPSW (inverse propensity score weighted) adjustment.  Results:   Overall 87,344 patients were identified. The 3,475 Agent Orange exposed patients were younger (p <0.001), had lower prostate specific antigen (p = 0.002) and were more likely to receive local therapy and chemotherapy (p <0.001) than the 83,869 nonexposed patients.

We sought to better understand the immune landscape in prostate cancer and identify immune-related biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.  Methods:   We analyzed gene expression data from 7826 prospectively collected prostatectomy samples (2013-2016), and 1567 retrospective samples with long-term clinical outcomes, for a total of 9393 samples, all profiled on the same commercial clinical platform in a CLIA-certified lab. The primary outcome was distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Secondary outcomes included biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS). All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of hallmark pathways demonstrated an immune-related tumor cluster. Increased estimated immune content scores based on immune-specific genes from the literature were associated with worse bRFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.26 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12 to 1.42]; P < .001), DMFS (HR = 1.34 [95% CI = 1.13 to 1.58]; P < .001), PCSS (HR = 1.53 [95% CI = 1.21 to 1.92]; P < .001), and OS (HR = 1.27 [95% CI = 1.07 to 1.50]; P = .006). Deconvolution using Cibersort revealed that mast cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells conferred improved DMFS, whereas macrophages and T-cells conferred worse DMFS. Interestingly, while PD-L1 was not prognostic, consistent with its low expression in prostate cancer, PD-L2 was expressed at statistically significantly higher levels (P < .001) and was associated with worse bRFS (HR = 1.17 [95% CI = 1.03 to 1.33]; P = .01), DMFS (HR = 1.25 [95% CI = 1.05 to 1.49]; P = .01), and PCSS (HR = 1.45 [95% CI = 1.13 to 1.86]; P = .003). PD-L2 was strongly associated with immune-related pathways on gene set enrichment analysis suggesting that it is playing an important role in immune modulation in clinical prostate cancer samples. Furthermore, PD-L2 was correlated with radiation response pathways, and also predicted response to postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) on multivariable interaction analysis (P = .03).

While low levels of ANXA7 are associated with aggressive types of cancer, the clinical impact of ANXA7 in prostate cancer remains unclear. Tissue microarrays (TMA) have revealed several new molecular markers in human tumors. Herein, we have identified the prognostic impact of ANXA7 in a prostate cancer using a tissue microarray containing 637 different specimens.  Methods:   The patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer and long-term follow-up information on progression (median 5.3 years), tumor-specific and overall survival data (median 5.9 years) were available. Expression of Ki67, Bcl-2, p53, CD-10 (neutral endopeptidase), syndecan-1 (CD-138) and ANXA7 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   A bimodal distribution of ANXA7 was observed. Tumors expressing either high or no ANXA7 were found to be associated with poor prognosis. However, ANXA7 at an optimal level, in between high and no ANXA7 expression, had a better prognosis. This correlated with low Ki67, Bcl-2, p53 and high syndecan-1 which are known predictors of early recurrence. At Gleason grade 3, ANXA7 is an independent predictor of poor overall survival with a p-value of 0.003. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, which is known to be associated with overexpression of Bcl-2 and inhibition of Ki67 LI and CD-10, was found to be associated with under-expression of ANXA7.

Its fast diffusion as an imaging method for diagnosis and follow-up of cancer has been facilitated by the existence of a single tracer for all kinds of oncological PET explorations. Nowadays, this tracer, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), is so largely distributed that non oncological PET indications have emerged. For instance, PET with FDG has totally supplanted gallium-67 for the evaluation of inflammatory conditions. Another non oncological domain in which PET with FDG has kept an important clinical role is neurology. The strong local relationship between neuronal activity and cerebral glucose uptake confers to PET with FDG a primordial role in neurological conditions in which structural changes are insufficient to establish a firm diagnosis. This is the case for focal epilepsy that remains an undisputed indication of PET with FDG, and for neurodegenerative disorders, in particular those that lead to dementia for which tracers detecting amyloid and tau depositions are now available. New tracers have enlarged PET indications in oncology, in particular for cancers that are not well evaluated with FDG.

Recording was performed with a system for measuring pressure changes using a stainless steel needle electrode inside the cavernous bodies. Stimulation was systematically performed at three distinct moments during the surgery at various points. An increase or decrease in pressure of 4 cm of H20 in the cavernous bodies was considered a positive result and negative response when no changes occurred after 30 seconds of continuous stimulation.  Results:   Of patients, 91.6% had positive responses to initial stimulation. The anesthetic regimen did not appear to significantly influence the responses in our series.  Conclusions:   In light of the results of this study, the stimulation of the cavernous nerves may be a viable technique in the right context, which includes good patient selection (young patients with a localized tumor and with preserved potency). The major limitation is that mapping techniques are useful to localize functional nerves, but not to monitor function in a continuous manner.""","""['Guillermo Martín-Palomeque', 'Lidia Cabañes-Martínez', 'Gema de Blas Beorlegui', 'M Del Mar Moreno Galera', 'Jaime R López', 'Francisco Javier Burgos', 'Ignacio Regidor Bailly-Baillière']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Neurophysiol""","""['Intraoperative cavernous nerve stimulation and Laser-Doppler flowmetry during radical prostatectomy.', 'Intraoperative electrical stimulation of cavernous nerves with monitoring of intracorporeal pressure to confirm nerve sparing during radical prostatectomy: Early clinical results.', 'Prospective comprehensive assessment of sexual function after retropubic non nerve sparing radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'Nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy: techniques and clinical considerations.']"""

Yet, few data are available on therapy efficacy in the subgroup with visceral metastases, who represent a small population with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical experience of AAP in patients with mCRPC with liver and/or lung metastases in real-world setting. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients with mCRPC with liver and/or lung metastases treated at the National Cancer Institute 'Fondazione G. Pascale' from September 2011 to May 2017. Co-primary end points were overall survival and radiographic PFS. Survival estimates were computed using Kaplan-Meier method. Secondary end points were response rate and safety. Of 143 patients with mCRPC treated, 18.9% (N=27) had visceral metastases: 85.2% (N=23) of the lung, 11.1% (N=3) of the liver and 3.7% (N=1) of both. Median PFS was 13.1 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.8-NA] in the pre-CT setting (N=11, median follow-up: 12.9 months), and 10.5 months (95% CI: 4.4-16.6) in the post-CT setting (N=16, median follow-up: 17.2 months). Pre-CT and post-CT patients with lung metastases had a median PFS of 16.5 months (95% CI: 4.3-NA) and 11.4 months (95% CI: 4.2-17.0), respectively. AAP tolerability was consistent with that previously reported in patients with mCRPC, without new safety concerns.

Despite the low expression, EGFR has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for patients with castration‑resistant PCa. Non‑invasive methods for determination of EGFR expression in PCa can serve for patient stratification and therapy response monitoring. Radionuclide imaging probes based on affibody molecules (7 kDa) provide high contrast imaging of cancer‑associated molecular targets. We hypothesized that the anti‑EGFR affibody molecule DOTA‑ZEGFR:2377 labeled with 55Co (positron‑emitter, T1/2=17.5 h) would enable imaging of EGFR expression in PCa xenografts. The human PCa cell line DU‑145 was used for in vitro and in vivo experiments and 57Co was used as a surrogate for 55Co in the present study. Binding of 57Co‑DOTA‑ZEGFR:2377 to EGFR‑expressing xenografts was saturable with anti‑EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab, which would motivate the use of this tracer for monitoring the receptor occupancy during treatment. A signiﬁcant dose‑dependent difference in radioactivity accumulation in tumors and normal organs was observed when the biodistribution was studied 3 h after the injection of 10 and 35 µg of 57Co‑DOTA‑ZEGFR:2377: At lower doses the tumor uptake was 2‑fold higher although tumor‑to‑organ ratios were not altered. For clinically relevant organs for PCa, tumor‑to‑organ ratios increased with time, and at 24 h pi were 2.2±0.5 for colon, 7±2 for muscle, and 4.0±0.7 for bones. Small animal SPECT/CT images confirmed the capacity of radiocobalt labeled DOTA‑ZEGFR:2377 to visualize EGFR expression in PCa. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the feasibility of using the radiocobalt labeled anti‑EGFR affibody conjugate ZEGFR:2377 as an imaging agent for in vivo visualization of low EGFR‑expressing tumors, like PCa, and for monitoring of receptor occupancy during cetuximab therapy as well as the importance of optimal dosing in order to achieve higher sensitivity molecular imaging.""","""['Bogdan Mitran', 'Ken Gösta Andersson', 'Elin Lindström', 'Javad Garousi', 'Maria Rosestedt', 'Vladimir Tolmachev', 'Stefan Ståhl', 'Anna Orlova', 'John Löfblom']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Evaluation of a radiocobalt-labelled affibody molecule for imaging of human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 expression.', 'Feasibility of imaging of epidermal growth factor receptor expression with ZEGFR:2377 affibody molecule labeled with 99mTc using a peptide-based cysteine-containing chelator.', 'Affibody-Based PET Imaging to Guide EGFR-Targeted Cancer Therapy in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer Models.', 'Analysis of Progress and Challenges of EGFR-Targeted Molecular Imaging in Cancer With a Focus on Affibody Molecules.', 'Identification of Disease States and Response to Therapy in Humans by Utilizing the Biomarker EGFR for Targeted Molecular Imaging.', 'Rational Design of Constrained Peptides as Protein Interface Inhibitors.', 'PET and SPECT Imaging of the EGFR Family (RTK Class I) in Oncology.', 'Affibody Molecules as Targeting Vectors for PET Imaging.']"""

In this context, galectin-1 (Gal-1) is a key molecule in the determination of the prostatic carcinoma microenviroment; therefore, it is essential to understand all the molecular processes in which this protein is involved. Most of the previous studies found in the literature have focused on the microenvironment remodeling properties of tumor-secreted Gal-1, through its interactions with the glyco-receptors at the cell membrane and the extracellular matrix. This report shows original aspects of the lectin by focusing on the role of lymphocyte endogenous Gal-1 in controlling anti-prostate tumor immunity. Using a murine preclinical model of prostate cancer, our results demonstrate that endogenous Gal-1 in lymphocytes modulates their proliferative rate and cytotoxic function in conditions of high extracellular Gal-1 concentration, mainly derived from tumor cells. In such conditions, the absence of Gal-1 in T lymphocytes potentiates anti-tumor immune responses. Further studies demonstrated that endogenous Gal-1 in CD4+, but mainly in CD8+T cells, acts as a negative regulator of anti-tumor immunity. In conclusion, prostate tumors require Gal-1 in lymphocytes to evade immune responses.

Recent studies have also demonstrated benefits in progression free survival in patients with non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Enzalutamide has an excellent toxicity profile, but we have to avoid it in patients with history of seizure episodes, mainly if they are under anti-epileptic drug therapy. Enzalutamide is rapidly metabolized by the liver, mainly through the CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4/5 so that its metabolism may be altered when cytochrome isoenzyme inductor or inhibitor drugs are given concomitantly. Moreover, enzalutamide may require dose adjustment for other drugs since it is a potent inductor of CYP3A4 and a moderate inductor of CYP2C9 y el CYP2C19. Even though treatment with enzalutamide has significantly altered the natural history of the disease, in most cases it will progress by development of resistance mechanisms, among which we may emphasize androgen receptor mutations, overexpression, amplification and variants, as well as the intracrine production of androgens.

We also identified changes unique to each of the two cancer subpopulations. Those specific to cancer luminal cells were associated with regulation of metabolic processes, cell proliferation and epithelial development. Within the prostate cancer TCGA dataset, these changes were able to distinguish not only cancers from normal samples, but also organ-confined cancers from those with extraprostatic extensions.

Objective:   We sought to develop a web-based system that uses a prostate cancer (CaP) registry to provide newly diagnosed men with a platform to view predicted treatment decisions based on patients with similar characteristics.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) is a quality improvement consortium of urology practices that maintains a prospective registry of men with CaP. We used registry data from 45 MUSIC urology practices from 2015 to 2017 to develop and validate a random forest machine learning model. After fitting the random forest model to a derivation cohort consisting of a random two-thirds sample of patients after stratifying by practice location, we evaluated the model performance in a validation cohort consisting of the remaining one-third of patients using a multiclass area under the curve (AUC) measure and calibration plots.  Results and limitations:   We identified 7543 men diagnosed with CaP, of whom 45% underwent radical prostatectomy, 30% surveillance, 17% radiation therapy, 5.6% androgen deprivation, and 1.8% watchful waiting. The personalized prediction for patients in the validation cohort was highly accurate (AUC 0.81).  Conclusions:   Using clinical registry data and machine learning methods, we created a web-based platform for patients that generates accurate predictions for most CaP treatments.  Patient summary:   We have developed and tested a tool to help men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer to view predicted treatment decisions based on similar patients from our registry.

Given the need to minimize scan time during most routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions of body regions, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with only three orthogonal diffusion weighting directions (x, y, z) is usually performed. Moreover, as water diffusion within malignant tumors is generically thought to be almost isotropic, DWI with only three diffusion weighting directions is considered sufficient for oncological application and it represents the de facto standard in body DKI. In this context, since the kurtosis tensor and diffusion tensor cannot be obtained, the averages of the three directional (Kx , Ky , Kz ) and (Dx , Dy , Dz ) - namely K and D, respectively - represent the best-possible surrogates of directionless DKI-derived indices of kurtosis and diffusivity, respectively. This would require fitting the DKI model to the diffusion-weighted images acquired along each direction (x, y, z) prior to averaging. However, there is a growing tendency to perform only a single fit of the DKI model to the geometric means of the images acquired with diffusion-sensitizing gradient along (x, y, z), referred to as trace-weighted (TW) images. To the best of our knowledge, no in vivo studies have evaluated how TW images affect estimates of DKI-derived indices of K and D. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the potential bias and error introduced in estimated K and D by fitting the DKI model to the TW images in HN cancer patients.  Methods:   Eighteen patients with histologically proven malignant tumors of the HN were enrolled in the study. They underwent pretreatment 3 T MRI, including DWI (b-values: 0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 s/mm2 ). Some patients had multiple lesions, and thus a total of 34 lesions were analyzed. DKI-derived indices were estimated, voxel-by-voxel, using single diffusion-weighted images along (x, y, z) as well as TW images. A comparison between the two estimation methods was performed by calculating the percentage error in D (Derr ) and K (Kerr ). Also, diffusivity anisotropy (Danis ) and diffusional kurtosis anisotropy (Kanis ) were estimated. Agreements between the two estimation methods were assessed by Bland-Altman plots. The Spearman rank correlation test was used to study the correlations between Kerr /Derr and Danis /Kanis. RESULTS: The median (95% confidence interval) Kerr and Derr were 5.1% (0.8%, 32.6%) and 1.7% (-2.5%, 5.3%), respectively. A significant relationship was observed between Kerr and Danis (correlation coefficient R = 0.694, P < 0.0001), as well as between Kerr and Kanis (R = 0.848, P < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   In HN cancer, the fit of the DKI model to TW images can introduce bias and error in the estimation of K and D, which may be non-negligible for single lesions, and should hence be adopted with caution.""","""['Simona Marzi', 'Silvia Minosse', 'Antonello Vidiri', 'Francesca Piludu', 'Marco Giannelli']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['On the use of trace-weighted images in body diffusional kurtosis imaging.', 'Evaluation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Standard Diffusion Imaging for Detection and Grading of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.', 'Correlation study between DKI and conventional DWI in brain and head and neck tumors.', 'Visualizing non-Gaussian diffusion: clinical application of q-space imaging and diffusional kurtosis imaging of the brain and spine.', 'Body diffusion kurtosis imaging: Basic principles, applications, and considerations for clinical practice.', 'Whole lesion histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient predicts therapy response in locally advanced rectal cancer.', 'Application of diffusion kurtosis tensor MR imaging in characterization of renal cell carcinomas with different pathological types and grades.', 'A comparative study of methods for determining Intravoxel incoherent motion parameters in cervix cancer.', 'Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging as a Prognostic Marker in Osteosarcoma Patients with Preoperative Chemotherapy.', 'Can Trace-Weighted Images Be Used to Estimate Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging-Derived Indices of Non-Gaussian Water Diffusion in Head and Neck Cancer?']"""

And the signaling pathways underlying the function of GAS5 during the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PC) were clarified.  Materials and methods:   Patients with PC were recruited and grouped according to their specific genotypes of rs55829688 and rs145204276. Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves were calculated and compared among different groups. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays were conducted to examine the expression of different factors involved in PC. And computational analyses and luciferase assays were conducted to clarify the regulatory relationships among the above factors. MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide), flow cytometry, and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) assays were used to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis.  Results:   The expression of GAS5, PDCD4, PTEN, and AKT was decreased gradually in the order of patient Group 1-4, whereas the expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and miR-1284 showed an opposite trend. GAS5 was identified to target miR-21 and miR-1284, whereas miR-21 and miR-1284 regulated the expression of PDCD4/PTEN and AKT, respectively. Moreover, the GAS5/miR-21/PDCD4/PTEN and GAS5/miR-1284/AKT signaling pathway was found to be closely related to the tumorigenesis of PC.  Conclusions:   GAS5 SNPs affected the survival rate and prognosis in patients with PC via regulating the expression of miR-21/miR-1284, which in turn affected the expression of PDCD4, PTEN, and AKT. GAS5 downregulated the expression of miR-21/miR-1284, thus leading to the elevated expression of key regulators of apoptosis.

Phenolic acids (syringic, gallic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic), indole compounds (L-tryptophan, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, 5-methyltryptamine), sterols (ergosterol, ergosterol peroxide, hexestrol, cholecalciferol), and triterpenes (betulinic acid, betulin) were determined quantitatively by high performance liquid chromatography with UV-Vis/DAD detection, while fatty acids were assessed with the gas chromatography method. Cytotoxic activity against selected human cancer cell lines was determined using the lactate dehydrogenase test. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated on lipopolysaccharide activated A549 cells. Those extracts with anti-inflammatory activity were evaluated for their inhibition of pro-inflammatory enzymes. The mycelium extract exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against prostate cancer cells, while the fruiting body extract indicated a moderate effect on the viability of melanoma and prostate cancer. Incubation of lung epithelial cells with biomass extract significantly decreased cyclooxygenase-2 levels compared to LPS activated A549 cells. This paper is the first report of a comparative quantitative analysis of the metabolites in mycelial cultures and fruiting bodies.

However, the correlation between hyperglycemia and lymphatic metastasis in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. Our previous study demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) enhances vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) expression, a lymphangiogenic factor, through activating it receptors LPA1/3 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Moreover, hyperglycemia up-regulates autotaxin (ATX) expression, a LPA-generating enzyme. Therefore, we propose that high glucose promotes VEGF-C expression through LPA signaling in PCa cells.  Methods:   Pharmacological inhibitors and siRNAs were utilized to investigate the molecular mechanism of high glucose-induced VEGF-C expression. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to determine the mRNA and protein expressions, respectively. Cellular bioenergetics analysis was performed to determine the glycolysis levels.  Results:   We demonstrated that the expressions of VEGF-C, ATX, and calreticulin were increased upon high glucose treatments in PC-3 cells. Moreover, high glucose-induced VEGF-C expression was mediated through the LPA1/3, PLC, Akt, ROS and LEDGF-dependent pathways. Additionally, high glucose enhanced the aerobic glycolysis via LPA1/3.

We provide a long-term update after 10 years of follow-up of the primary endpoint (progression-free survival) and report on the late toxicities of treatment.  Methods:   The trial was designed as a 2 × 2 factorial study with hormonal sequencing as one stratification factor and radiation field as the other factor and tested whether NHT improved progression-free survival versus AHT, and NHT plus WPRT versus NHT plus PORT. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed, clinically localised adenocarcinoma of the prostate, an estimated risk of lymph node involvement of more than 15% and a Karnofsky performance status of more than 70, with no age limitations. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) by permuted block randomisation to receive either NHT 2 months before and during WPRT followed by a prostate boost to 70 Gy (NHT plus WPRT group), NHT 2 months before and during PORT to 70 Gy (NHT plus PORT group), WPRT followed by 4 months of AHT (WPRT plus AHT group), or PORT followed by 4 months of AHT (PORT plus AHT group). Hormonal therapy was combined androgen suppression, consisting of goserelin acetate 3·6 mg once a month subcutaneously or leuprolide acetate 7·5 mg once a month intramuscularly, and flutamide 250 mg twice a day orally for 4 months. Randomisation was stratified by T stage, Gleason Score, and prostate-specific antigen concentration. NHT was given 2 months before radiotherapy and was continued until radiotherapy completion; AHT was given at the completion of radiotherapy for 4 months. The primary endpoint progression-free survival was analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00769548. The trial has been terminated to additional follow-up collection and this is the final analysis for this trial.  Findings:   Between April 1, 1995, and June 1, 1999, 1322 patients were enrolled from 53 centres and randomly assigned to the four treatment groups. With a median follow-up of 8·8 years (IQR 5·07-13·84) for all patients and 14·8 years (7·18-17·4) for living patients (n=346), progression-free survival across all timepoints continued to differ significantly across the four treatment groups (p=0·002). The 10-year estimates of progression-free survival were 28·4% (95% CI 23·3-33·6) in the NHT plus WPRT group, 23·5% (18·7-28·3) in the NHT plus PORT group, 19·4% (14·9-24·0) in the WPRT plus AHT group, and 30·2% (25·0-35·4) in the PORT plus AHT group. Bladder toxicity was the most common grade 3 or worse late toxicity, affecting 18 (6%) of 316 patients in the NHT plus WPRT group, 17 (5%) of 313 in the NHT plus PORT group, 22 (7%) of 317 in the WPRT plus AHT group, and 14 (4%) of 315 in the PORT plus AHT group. Late grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in 22 (7%) of 316 patients in the NHT plus WPRT group, five (2%) of 313 in the NHT plus PORT group, ten (3%) of 317 in the WPRT plus AHT group, and seven (2%) of 315 in the PORT plus AHT group.  Interpretation:   In this cohort of patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk localised prostate cancer, NHT plus WPRT improved progression-free survival compared with NHT plus PORT and WPRT plus AHT at long-term follow-up albeit increased risk of grade 3 or worse intestinal toxicity. Interactions between radiotherapy and hormonal therapy suggests that WPRT should be avoided without NHT.

No conclusive data are reported about the length of the learning curve of a BS.  Objective:   To highlight the role of a BS during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and to analyze the effect of the learning curve of a BS on intra- and postoperative outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   From June 2013 to September 2016, 129 RARPs were performed by one expert CS (>1000 RARPs) and two BSs (residents). According to the learning curve of the BS, the patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (first 20 procedures), group 2 (21-40 procedures), and group 3 (>40 procedures).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Preoperative variables, pathological data, operating time (OT), blood loss (BL), number of lymph nodes excised (LE), length of hospital stay (LHS), and time to catheter removal (CR) were analyzed. Linear/logistic regression analyses tested the impact of BS experience on surgical outcomes. T test and chi-square test compared the outcomes of the two BSs.  Results and limitations:   Perfect interaction between CSs and BSs are requested to obtain the optimal exposure and avoid any conflict. On the linear regression model, BS learning curve was not related to OT, BL, LHS, and CR, but was related to LE (r2=0.09; p=0.03). On multivariate analyses, no correlation between BS experience and OT, BL, LHS, CR, LE, margin status, and complications (all p>0.05) was found. Comparing the two BSs, no difference was found for the abovementioned outcomes in the first 40 surgeries (all p>0.05). Study limitations include the limited cohort of patients and its retrospective nature.  Conclusions:   In this study, BS learning curve does not appear to influence the surgical outcomes; good experience of the CS was probably the explanation.

Positive biopsy rates were compared using Chi-square tests between biopsy groups in all patients and two subgroups divided by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 10 ng/mL.  Results:   The positive biopsy rate decreased in the order of the focal lesion group, the sextant biopsy group, and the nonfocal lesion group. All prostate cancers and prostate cancers with a Gleason score ≥7 were detected more frequently among patients with PSA ≤10 ng/mL in the focal lesion group than in the sextant biopsy group ( p = 0.008 and 0.007, respectively) and less frequently among patients with PSA >10 ng/mL in the nonfocal lesion group than in the sextant biopsy group ( p = 0.007 and 0.003, respectively).

Methods:   Between January 2008 and February 2017, we identified 13 RTRs who were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and underwent radical prostatectomy. We reviewed all available clinicopathologic data for these 13 patients.  Results:   The median patient age was 61 years and median serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 8.79 ng/mL. The mean period between transplantation and diagnosis of prostate cancer was 136 months. The sources for the kidney transplants included 10 living and 3 deceased donors. Biopsies indicated that the Gleason scores were 7 in 10 patients and 8 to 10 in 3 patients. Meanwhile, the D'Amico risk classification indicated an intermediate risk in 9 patients and a high risk in 4 patients. Eight patients were at stage cT1 and 5 were at stage cT2. The surgical procedure was retropubic radical prostatectomy in one recipient, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in 3 recipients, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in 9 RTRs. Intraoperative complications were not noted in any patient, although one patient demonstrated postoperative complications (Clavien grade ≥ 3). An indwelling urinary catheter was required in 3 patients for over 3 weeks due to delayed wound healing. Biochemical recurrence evaluated by PSA monitoring occurred in four patients. Postoperative graft function was stable in all but one patient who required resumption of dialysis before prostatectomy; however, all patients are alive at the time of publication with 12 patients showing well-functioning renal allografts.

There are currently no guidelines or consensus on prostate cancer screening and treatment in donors. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical course of donor candidates with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Between January 2006 and December 2016, 9 donor candidates for living related kidney transplantation were incidentally diagnosed with prostate cancer at our institution. All male kidney transplant donor candidates routinely received prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. The patients with PSA levels > 4.0 ng/mL underwent prostate biopsies. For future kidney transplantation, treatment for localized prostate cancer was prostatectomy.  Results:   Seven low- or intermediate-risk patients according to the D'Amico risk classification underwent endoscopic prostatectomy, while 2 high-risk patients underwent high dose-rate brachytherapy to prioritize prostate cancer treatment. Of the 7 who underwent surgery, 3 patients ultimately became living related kidney transplantation donors for their wives. There was no recurrence of PSA elevation after treatment.  Conclusion:   This study showed that donor candidates with prostate cancer could safely donate a kidney after a thorough evaluation to exclude those with high-risk prostate cancer.

TM1 was in two forms: (i) 1, 3-dione-5, 5-dimethylcyclohexane; and, (ii) 2-enone-3hydroxy -5,5-dimethylcylohex, while TM2 was 4H-1,3-dioxin-4-one-2,3,6-trimethyl. These metabolites did not exhibit any irritant or allergic reaction as revealed by HET- CAM test. TM2 significantly inhibited the growth of H. pylori and Shigella toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) as evident by in vitro and microscopic observations of bacterial cell death. TM2 also induced the cell death and cytotoxicity, as revealed by cell viability test and western blot analysis. According to microscopic, flow cytometer and western blot analysis, TM2 treated cells displayed higher ROS, cell death, and apoptosis-related protein expression than TM1 and control.

Additionally, low dose trivalent Cr [Cr(III)] exposure has no obvious carcinogenic effects in prostate cancer. However, Cr(VI) can promote proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cell line PC3 cells in vitro and in vivo. In seeking the molecular mechanism of Cr(VI) exposure on cancer progression, we found that Cr(VI) could down-regulate the epithelial protein marker, E-cadherin, and up-regulate mesenchymal protein markers, such as N-cadherin and Snail.

Current clinical planning systems do not exploit the total dose information and largely use the American Association of Physicists in Medicine TG-43 dosimetry formalism to ensure clinically acceptable planning times. Thus, suboptimal plans may be derived as a result of TG-43-related dose overestimation and nonconformity with dose distribution requirements. The purpose of this study was to propose an inverse planning approach that can improve planning quality by combining dose-volume information and precision without compromising the overall execution times.  Methods and materials:   The dose map was generated by accumulating precomputed Monte Carlo (MC) dose kernels for each candidate source implantation site. The MC computational burden was reduced by using graphics processing unit acceleration, allowing accurate dosimetry calculations to be performed in the intraoperative environment. The proposed dose-volume histogram (DVH) fast simulated annealing optimization algorithm was evaluated using clinical plans that were delivered to 18 patients who underwent low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.

Patients and methods:   A total of 17 prostate cancer patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and interstitial brachytherapy (IBT). CT and MRI datasets were acquired back-to-back based on a 65 cm3 air-filled ERB and drinking instructions. After rigid co-registration of the imaging data, the CT-based planning target volume (PTV) used for treatment planning was retrospectively compared to an MRI-based adaptive PTV and the dose to the PB was determined in each case. The adapted PTV encompassed a caudally cropped CT-based PTV which was defined on the basis of the MRI-based prostate contour plus an additional 5 mm safety margin.  Results:   In the seven-field IMRT treatment plans, the MRI-based adapted PTV achieved mean (Dmean) and maximum (Dmax) doses to the PB which were significantly lower (by 7.6 Gy and 10.9 Gy, respectively; p <0.05) than those of the CT-contoured PTV. For 6 patients, the estimated PB Dmax (seven-field IMRT and IBT) for the adapted PTV was <70 Gy, whereas only 1 patient fulfilled this criterium with the CT-based PTV.  Conclusion:   MRI-based contouring and seven-field IMRT-based treatment planning achieved dose sparing to the PB. Whereas the comparison of MRI and CT contouring only relates to external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) sparing, considering EBRT and IBT shows the improvement in PB sparing for the total treatment.""","""['F Böckelmann', 'M Hammon', 'S Lettmaier', 'R Fietkau', 'C Bert', 'F Putz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Sparing the penile bulb in the radical irradiation of clinically localised prostate carcinoma: A comparison between MRI and CT prostatic apex definition in 3DCRT, Linac-IMRT and Helical Tomotherapy.', 'The radiation doses to erectile tissues defined with magnetic resonance imaging after intensity-modulated radiation therapy or iodine-125 brachytherapy.', 'Vessel-sparing prostate radiotherapy: dose limitation to critical erectile vascular structures (internal pudendal artery and corpus cavernosum) defined by MRI.', 'IMRT for prostate cancer: defining target volume based on correlated pathologic volume of disease.', 'Radiation dose-volume effects and the penile bulb.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy and the dosimetric impact of inter- and intrafractional motion on the planning target volume for prostate cancer patients.', '4D perfusion CT of prostate cancer for image-guided radiotherapy planning: A proof of concept study.']"""

Previous studies reported higher total hospital charges (THCs) for RARP than open RP (ORP). We hypothesized that based on increasing RARP surgical expertise, differences in THCs between RARP and ORP should have decreased or even disappeared in the United States in most contemporary years.  Patients and methods:   Within the National Inpatient Sample database (2008-2015), we identified patients who underwent RARP or ORP. Multivariable linear regression models with adjustment for clustering were used to test for differences in THCs. Subgroup analyses focused on geographical regions, defined as West, Midwest, South and Northeast.  Results:   Of 83,693 RP patients, 51,363 (61.4%) underwent RARP. RARP rates increased from 13.1 to 81.5% (p = 0.04). Overall, median THCs were $11,898 vs. $10,162 (p < 0.001) for RARP vs. ORP, respectively. After adjustment for complications, length of stay and clustering, RARP was associated with higher THCs ($3124 more for each RARP, p < 0.001). Additional charges for RARP did not change over time (p = 0.3). However, additional charges for RARP were highest in the West ($4610, p < 0.001), followed by the Midwest ($3278, p < 0.001), the South ($2906, p < 0.001) and the Northeast ($2216, p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   RARP rates have increased exponentially from 13.1 to over 80%. Similar rates were identified across all four geographical regions. RARP THCs exceeded those of ORP.

The only FDA-cleared method, CellSearch, makes use of antibody against epithelial surface protein expressed on CTCs, thus obstructing wide application for various cancers with non-epithelial and semi-epithelial characteristics including renal cell carcinoma. Due to rarity and ambiguity of CTCs, designed experiment including non-biased CTC isolation and subsequent cytopathological study for finding applicable immunomarkers are urgently needed for clinical use of CTCs for less-studied cancers. Here, in order to construct the fundamental step for CTC diagnosis without limitation of its epithelial characteristics, we present the simple and novel method which incorporate both label-free CTC isolation and pathological study using hydrogel-based cell block formation. Six cell lines from lung, ovarian, kidney cancers were used to make cell block and analyzed by conventional immunocytochemical staining method to find the candidate markers for CTC. Especially for renal cancer, the physically isolated CTCs were further immunocytochemically examined with the screened candidate markers by cell block construction, and verified their clinical utility using blood samples from patients with renal cell carcinoma. This comprehensive study demonstrates that the present approach can be used to find the potential markers for any type of cancers regardless of their epithelial characteristics and isolate the specific type of CTCs in label-free manners.""","""['Yoon-Tae Kang', 'Young Jun Kim', 'Tae Hee Lee', 'Young-Ho Cho', 'Hee Jin Chang', 'Hyun-Moo Lee']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition leads to disease-stage differences in circulating tumor cell detection and metastasis in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer.', 'Classification of circulating tumor cells by epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers.', 'Nanoroughened adhesion-based capture of circulating tumor cells with heterogeneous expression and metastatic characteristics.', 'Circulating tumor cells as promising novel biomarkers in solid cancers.', 'Circulating tumour cells in metastatic head and neck cancers.', 'Clinical Validation of a Size-Based Microfluidic Device for Circulating Tumor Cell Isolation and Analysis in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells as Biomarkers for Renal Cell Carcinoma: Ready for Prime Time?', 'Liquid Biopsy-Based Colorectal Cancer Screening via Surface Markers of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'A lab-on-a-disc platform enables serial monitoring of individual CTCs associated with tumor progression during EGFR-targeted therapy for patients with NSCLC.', 'BRMS1: a multifunctional signaling molecule\xa0in metastasis.']"""

Here, we investigated how ETS TFs bind with the AP1 TFs JUN-FOS at composite DNA-binding sites. DNA-binding ability with JUN-FOS correlated with the phenotype of ETS proteins in prostate cancer. We found that the oncogenic ETS-related gene (ERG) and ETS variant (ETV) 1/4/5 subfamilies co-occupy ETS-AP1 sites with JUN-FOS in vitro, whereas JUN-FOS robustly inhibited DNA binding by the tumor suppressors ETS homologous factor (EHF) and SAM pointed domain-containing ETS TF (SPDEF). EHF bound ETS-AP1 DNA with tighter affinity than ERG in the absence of JUN-FOS, possibly enabling EHF to compete with ERG and JUN-FOS for binding to ETS-AP1 sites. Genome-wide mapping of EHF- and ERG-binding sites in prostate epithelial cells revealed that EHF is preferentially excluded from closely spaced ETS-AP1 DNA sequences. Structural modeling and mutational analyses indicated that adjacent positively charged surfaces from EHF and JUN-FOS use electrostatic repulsion to disfavor simultaneous DNA binding. Conservation of positive residues on the JUN-FOS interface identified E74-like ETS TF 1 (ELF1) as an additional ETS TF exhibiting anticooperative DNA binding with JUN-FOS, and we found that ELF1 is frequently down-regulated in prostate cancer. In summary, divergent electrostatic features of ETS TFs at their JUN-FOS interface enable distinct binding events at ETS-AP1 DNA sites, which may drive specific targeting of ETS TFs to facilitate distinct transcriptional programs.""","""['Bethany J Madison', 'Kathleen A Clark', 'Niraja Bhachech', 'Peter C Hollenhorst', 'Barbara J Graves', 'Simon L Currie']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Identification of amino acid residues in the ETS transcription factor Erg that mediate Erg-Jun/Fos-DNA ternary complex formation.', 'The Ets transcription factors interact with each other and with the c-Fos/c-Jun complex via distinct protein domains in a DNA-dependent and -independent manner.', 'Long-range electrostatic interactions influence the orientation of Fos-Jun binding at AP-1 sites.', 'Jun and Fos regulation of NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase gene expression.', 'Close encounters of many kinds: Fos-Jun interactions that mediate transcription regulatory specificity.', 'Polymorphism, Genetic Effect, and Association with Egg-Laying Performance of Chahua Chickens Matrix Metalloproteinases 13 Promoter.', 'Sci-Seq of Human Fetal Salivary Tissue Introduces Human Transcriptional Paradigms and a Novel Cell Population.', 'ESE3-positive PSCs drive pancreatic cancer fibrosis, chemoresistance and poor prognosis via tumour-stromal IL-1β/NF-κB/ESE3 signalling axis.', 'EHF is a novel regulator of cellular redox metabolism and predicts patient prognosis in HNSCC.', 'Past, Current, and Future Strategies to Target ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.']"""

ADT failure results in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which inevitably leads to metastasis. We hypothesized that differences in tumor transcriptional programs may reflect differential responses to ADT and subsequent metastasis.  Results:   We performed whole transcriptome analysis of 20 patient-matched Pre-ADT biopsies and 20 Post-ADT prostatectomy specimens, and identified two subgroups of patients (high impact and low impact groups) that exhibited distinct transcriptional changes in response to ADT. We found that all patients lost the AR-dependent subtype (PCS2) transcriptional signatures. The high impact group maintained the more aggressive subtype (PCS1) signal, while the low impact group more resembled an AR-suppressed (PCS3) subtype. Computational analyses identified transcription factor coordinated groups (TFCGs) enriched in the high impact group network. Leveraging a large public dataset of over 800 metastatic and primary samples, we identified 33 TFCGs in common between the high impact group and metastatic lesions, including SOX4/FOXA2/GATA4, and a TFCG containing JUN, JUNB, JUND, FOS, FOSB, and FOSL1. The majority of metastatic TFCGs were subsets of larger TFCGs in the high impact group network, suggesting a refinement of critical TFCGs in prostate cancer progression.

This study aimed to propose an original nonlocal mean patch-based method (PBM) and to compare this PBM to an atlas-based method (ABM) and to a bulk density method (BDM) for prostate MRI-only radiation therapy.  Materials and methods:   Thirty-nine patients received a volumetric modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer. In addition to the planning computed tomography (CT) scans, T2-weighted MRI scans were acquired. pCTs were generated from MRIs using 3 methods: an original nonlocal mean PBM, ABM, and BDM. The PBM was performed using feature extraction and approximate nearest neighbor search in a training cohort. The PBM accuracy was evaluated in a validation cohort by using imaging and dosimetric endpoints. Imaging endpoints included mean absolute error and mean error between Hounsfield units of the pCT and the reference CT (CTref). Dosimetric endpoints were based on dose-volume histograms calculated from the CTref and the pCTs for various volumes of interest and on 3-dimensional gamma analyses. The PBM uncertainties were compared with those of the ABM and BDM.  Results:   The mean absolute error and mean error obtained from the PBM were 41.1 and -1.1 Hounsfield units. The PBM dose-volume histogram differences were 0.7% for prostate planning target volume V95%, 0.5% for rectum V70Gy, and 0.2% for bladder V50Gy. Compared with ABM and BDM, PBM provided significantly lower dose uncertainties for the prostate planning target volume (70-78 Gy), the rectum (8.5-29 Gy, 40-48 Gy, and 61-73 Gy), and the bladder (12-78 Gy). The PBM mean gamma pass rate (99.5%) was significantly higher than that of ABM (94.9%) or BDM (96.1%).  Conclusions:   The proposed PBM provides low uncertainties with dose planned on CTref.

Owning to the open access of many miRNA-related databases, up until recently, kinds of feasible in silico models have been proposed. In this work, we developed a computational model of Maximal Entropy Random Walk on heterogenous network for MiRNA-disease Association prediction (MERWMDA). MERWMDA integrated known disease-miRNA association, pair-wise functional relation of miRNAs and pair-wise semantic relation of diseases into a heterogenous network comprised of disease and miRNA nodes full of information. As a kind of widely-applied biased walk process with more randomness, MERW was then implemented on the heterogenous network to reveal potential disease-miRNA associations. Cross validation was further performed to evaluate the performance of MERWMDA. As a result, MERWMDA obtained AUCs of 0.8966 and 0.8491 respectively in the aspect of global and local leave-one-out cross validation. What' more, three different case study strategies on four human complex diseases were conducted to comprehensively assess the quality of the model. Specifically, one kind of case study on Esophageal cancer and Prostate cancer were conducted based on HMDD v2.0 database. 94% and 88% out of the top 50 ranked miRNAs were confirmed by recent literature, respectively. To simulate new disease without known related miRNAs, Lung cancer (confirmed ratio 94%) associated miRNAs were removed for case study. Lymphoma (verified ratio 88%) was adopted to assess the prediction robustness of MERWMDA based on HMDD v1.0 database. We anticipated that MERWMDA could offer valuable candidates for in vitro biomedical experiments in future.""","""['Ya-Wei Niu', 'Hua Liu', 'Guang-Hui Wang', 'Gui-Ying Yan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Math Biosci""","""['Integrating random walk and binary regression to identify novel miRNA-disease association.', 'MDHGI: Matrix Decomposition and Heterogeneous Graph Inference for miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'HNMDA: heterogeneous network-based miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'MicroRNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'In silico drug repositioning based on drug-miRNA associations.', 'Neutral quasispecies evolution and the maximal entropy random walk.', 'Prediction of disease-related metabolites using bi-random walks.', 'Benchmark of computational methods for predicting microRNA-disease associations.']"""

Recent developments in subgroup analysis consider subgroups that are defined in terms of the predicted individual treatment effect, i.e. the difference between the predicted outcome under treatment and the predicted outcome under control for each individual, which in turn may depend on multiple biomarkers. In this work, we study the properties of different modelling strategies to estimate the predicted individual treatment effect. We explore linear models and compare different estimation methods, such as maximum likelihood and the Lasso with and without randomized response. For the latter, we implement confidence intervals based on the selective inference framework to account for the model selection stage. We illustrate the methods in a dataset of a treatment for Alzheimer disease (normal response) and in a dataset of a treatment for prostate cancer (survival outcome). We also evaluate via simulations the performance of using the predicted individual treatment effect to identify subgroups where a novel treatment leads to better outcomes compared to a control treatment.""","""['Nicolás M Ballarini', 'Gerd K Rosenkranz', 'Thomas Jaki', 'Franz König', 'Martin Posch']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Multiplicity-adjusted semiparametric benefiting subgroup identification in clinical trials.', 'A Bayesian credible subgroups approach to identifying patient subgroups with positive treatment effects.', 'Bayesian credible subgroup identification for treatment effectiveness in time-to-event data.', 'Current vaccination strategies for prostate cancer.', 'Relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of methods of androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Selecting predictive biomarkers from genomic data.', 'A likely responder approach for the analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Applying methods for personalized medicine to the treatment of alcohol use disorder.', 'Q-Finder: An Algorithm for Credible Subgroup Discovery in Clinical Data Analysis - An Application to the International Diabetes Management Practice Study.', 'A critical review of graphics for subgroup analyses in clinical trials.']"""

OSG are complementary, yet significant adjunct to patient journeys. Machine learning and natural language processing techniques can be applied to these large volumes of unstructured text discussions accumulated in OSG for intelligent extraction of patient-reported demographics, behaviours, decisions, treatment, side effects and expressions of emotions. New insights from the fusion and synthesis of such diverse patient-reported information, as expressed throughout the patient journey from diagnosis to treatment and recovery, can contribute towards informed decision-making on personalized healthcare delivery and the development of healthcare policy guidelines.  Methods and findings:   We have designed and developed an artificial intelligence based analytics framework using machine learning and natural language processing techniques for intelligent analysis and automated aggregation of patient information and interaction trajectories in online support groups. Alongside the social interactions aspect, patient behaviours, decisions, demographics, clinical factors, emotions, as subsequently expressed over time, are extracted and analysed. More specifically, we utilised this platform to investigate the impact of online social influences on the intimate decision scenario of selecting a treatment type, recovery after treatment, side effects and emotions expressed over time, using prostate cancer as a model. Results manifest the three major decision-making behaviours among patients, Paternalistic group, Autonomous group and Shared group. Furthermore, each group demonstrated diverse behaviours in post-decision discussions on clinical outcomes, advice and expressions of emotion during the twelve months following treatment. Over time, the transition of patients from information and emotional support seeking behaviours to providers of information and emotional support to other patients was also observed.  Conclusions:   Findings from this study are a rigorous indication of the expectations of social media empowered patients, their potential for individualised decision-making, clinical and emotional needs. The increasing popularity of OSG further confirms that it is timely for clinicians to consider patient voices as expressed in OSG. We have successfully demonstrated that the proposed platform can be utilised to investigate, analyse and derive actionable insights from patient-reported information on prostate cancer, in support of patient focused healthcare delivery. The platform can be extended and applied just as effectively to any other medical condition.""","""['Daswin De Silva', 'Weranja Ranasinghe', 'Tharindu Bandaragoda', 'Achini Adikari', 'Nishan Mills', 'Lahiru Iddamalgoda', 'Damminda Alahakoon', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Raj Persad', 'Evgeny Osipov', 'Richard Gray', 'Damien Bolton']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Face-to-face vs. online peer support groups for prostate cancer: A cross-sectional comparison study.', 'Robotic-assisted vs. open radical prostatectomy: A machine learning framework for intelligent analysis of patient-reported outcomes from online cancer support groups.', 'The effect of an online support group on patients׳ treatment decisions for localized prostate cancer: An online survey.', 'Internet and information technology use in treatment of diabetes.', 'Emotions as Social Information in Shared Decision-Making in Oncology.', 'An artificial intelligence life cycle: From conception to production.', 'A Mental Health Chatbot with Cognitive Skills for Personalised Behavioural Activation and Remote Health Monitoring.', 'How aging of the global population is changing oncology.', 'Information Patients With Melanoma Spontaneously Report About Health-Related Quality of Life on Web-Based Forums: Case Study.', 'Analysis of Online Peripartum Depression Communities: Application of Multilabel Text Classification Techniques to Inform Digitally-Mediated Prevention and Management.']"""

However, these studies provide little information pertaining to AR-V7 expression in prostate cancer (PC) tissue.  Methods:   Following generation and validation of a potentially novel AR-V7 antibody for IHC, AR-V7 protein expression was determined for 358 primary prostate samples and 293 metastatic biopsies. Associations with disease progression, full-length androgen receptor (AR-FL) expression, response to therapy, and gene expression were determined.  Results:   We demonstrated that AR-V7 protein is rarely expressed (<1%) in primary PC but is frequently detected (75% of cases) following androgen deprivation therapy, with further significant (P = 0.020) increase in expression following abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide therapy. In CRPC, AR-V7 expression is predominantly (94% of cases) nuclear and correlates with AR-FL expression (P ≤ 0.001) and AR copy number (P = 0.026). However, dissociation of expression was observed, suggesting that mRNA splicing remains crucial for AR-V7 generation. AR-V7 expression was heterogeneous between different metastases from a patient, although AR-V7 expression was similar within a metastasis. Moreover, AR-V7 expression correlated with a unique 59-gene signature in CRPC, including HOXB13, a critical coregulator of AR-V7 function. Finally, AR-V7-negative disease associated with better prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses (100% vs. 54%, P = 0.03) and overall survival (74.3 vs. 25.2 months, hazard ratio 0.23 [0.07-0.79], P = 0.02) from endocrine therapies (pre-chemotherapy).  Conclusion:   This study provides impetus to develop therapies that abrogate AR-V7 signaling to improve our understanding of AR-V7 biology and to confirm the clinical significance of AR-V7.

Results:   A total of 37 intact O-glycopeptides and 23 intact N-glycopeptides are identified in the urinary profiles of 238 normal subjects. Among the most commonly identified O-glycoproteins are Apolipoprotein C-III and insulin-like growth factor II, while titin among the N-glycoproteins. Further statistical analysis reveals that three O-glycopeptides and five N-glycopeptides differed significantly in their abundance among the different cancer types, comparing to normal subjects.

As of 2018, the indications for MRI in the diagnosis and risk assessment of prostate cancer have expanded from preoperative evaluation to the pre-biopsy setting, as well as for surveillance protocols.

Methods:   Twenty-three patients, after radical prostatectomy were treated with adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy between July and December 2016 and considered for this evaluation. Weekly CBCT scans (n = 138) were imported into the treatment planning system, and the clinical tumor volume (CTV), the rectum and the bladder were contoured. The initially calculated dose distribution and the dose-volume histograms generated from weekly CBCTs were compared. The prostatic fossa dose coverage was assessed by the proportion of the CTV fully encompassed by the 95% and 98% isodose lines. Rectal and bladder volumes receiving 50, 60 and 65 Gy during the treatment were compared to the initial plan, with statistical significance determined using the one-sample t‑test.  Results:   Marked variations in the total organ volume of the rectum and the bladder were observed. The correlation between rectum volume and V50 was not significant (p = 0.487), while the bladder volume and V50 demonstrated a significant correlation. There was no correlation between urinary bladder volume and CTV. The change in rectal volume correlated significantly with CTV. The dose coverage (D98% and D95%) to the prostatic bed could be achieved for all patients due to the ventral shift in the volume differences of the rectum.  Conclusion:   Weekly CBCTs can be considered as adequate verification tools to assess the interfractional variability of the CTV and organs at risk. The proven volume changes in the urinary bladder and the rectum do not compromise the final delivered dose in the CTV.""","""['Ahmed Gawish', 'Ahmed Ali Chughtai', 'Michael J Eble']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Does rectum and bladder dose vary during the course of image-guided radiotherapy in the postprostatectomy setting?', 'Relationship between pelvic organ-at-risk dose and clinical target volume in postprostatectomy patients receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices during prostate external-beam radiation therapy: A review.', 'Development of RTOG consensus guidelines for the definition of the clinical target volume for postoperative conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Risk Factors of Acute Radiation-Induced Lung Injury Induced by Radiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer.', 'Evaluating the impact of possible interobserver variability in CBCT-based soft-tissue matching using TCP/NTCP models for prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Analysis of the Influence of Peripheral Anatomical Changes for CBCT-Guided Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Salvage radiation therapy in prostate cancer: relationship between rectal dose and long-term, self-reported rectal bleeding.', 'Moderately HRT vs. CRT for localized prostate cancer using image-guided VMAT with SIB: evaluation of acute and late toxicities.']"""

However, understanding rare cells is a complex problem, which requires cell isolation/purification and downstream molecular interrogation - processes challenged by non-target populations, which vary patient-to-patient and change with disease. As such, cell isolation platforms must be amenable to a range of sample types while maintaining high efficiency and purity. The multiplexed technology for automated extraction (mTAE) is a versatile magnetic bead-based isolation platform that facilitates positive, negative, and combinatorial selection with integrated protein staining and nucleic acid isolation. mTAE is validated by isolating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) - a model rare cell population - from breast and prostate cancer patient samples. Negative selection yielded high efficiency capture of CTCs while positive selection yielded higher purity with an average of only 95 contaminant cells captured per milliliter of processed whole blood. With combinatorial selection, an overall increase in capture efficiency was observed, highlighting the potential significance of integrating multiple capture approaches on a single platform. Following capture (and staining), on platform nucleic acid extraction enabled the detection of androgen receptor-related transcripts from CTCs isolated from prostate cancer patients. The flexibility (e.g. negative, positive, combinatorial selection) and capabilities (e.g. isolation, protein staining, and nucleic acid extraction) of mTAE enable users to freely interrogate specific cell populations, a capability required to understand the potential of emerging rare cell populations and readily adapt to the heterogeneity presented across clinical samples.""","""['Hannah M Pezzi', 'David J Guckenberger', 'Jennifer L Schehr', 'Jacob Rothbauer', 'Charlotte Stahlfeld', 'Anupama Singh', 'Sacha Horn', 'Zachery D Schultz', 'Rory M Bade', 'Jamie M Sperger', 'Scott M Berry', 'Joshua M Lang', 'David J Beebe']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Lab Chip""","""['High-purity and label-free isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in a microfluidic platform by using optically-induced-dielectrophoretic (ODEP) force.', 'All-in-one centrifugal microfluidic device for size-selective circulating tumor cell isolation with high purity.', 'Optimization and Evaluation of a Novel Size Based Circulating Tumor Cell Isolation System.', 'Microfluidic Devices for Circulating Tumor Cells Isolation and Subsequent Analysis.', 'Aptamer-functionalized nano/micro-materials for clinical diagnosis: isolation, release and bioanalysis of circulating tumor cells.', 'Enhanced Ribonucleoprotein Immunoprecipitation (RIP) Technique for the Identification of mRNA Species in Ribonucleoprotein Complexes.', 'Reversible epigenetic alterations regulate class I HLA loss in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular characterization of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase mutant T cells in human blood: The concept of surrogate selection for immunologically relevant cells.', 'A 3D mixing-based portable magnetic device for fully automatic immunofluorescence staining of γ-H2AX in UVC-irradiated CD4+ cells.', 'Analytical validation and initial clinical testing of quantitative microscopic evaluation for PD-L1 and HLA I expression on circulating tumor cells from patients with non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

The results showed that an elevated GCN5 expression was stimulated by IL-6. Knockdown of GCN5 significantly inhibited IL-6-driven proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, early growth response-1 (Egr-1) expression was elevated by IL-6 treatment and GCN5 siRNA down-regulated the expression of Egr-1. Furthermore, overexpression of Egr-1 attenuated the effects of GCN5 silence on cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in PCa. Besides, knockdown of GCN5 resulted in the down-regulation of p-Akt and up-regulation of PTEN, which was partly impeded by Egr-1 overexpression.

This national register-based cohort study utilizes a unique data source to investigate whether a stress resilience measure is associated with survival in cancer patients.  Methods:   The cohort includes 9,318 Swedish male cancer patients born during 1952 to 1956 who had their stress resilience evaluated at a semistructured interview with a psychologist during mandatory conscription examination in late adolescence.  Results:   Over a median of 3 years of follow-up from cancer diagnosis, a total of 2,541 patients died (2,322 from cancer). Overall, low (23%) compared with high (25%) stress resilience was associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio estimated by Cox regression 1.45; 95% confidence interval 1.28-1.65), particularly among men with carcinomas of the oropharynx (2.62, 1.24-5.56), upper respiratory tract (4.64, 1.05-20.41), and prostate (2.20, 1.04-4.62), as well as with Hodgkin lymphoma (3.52, 1.40-8.86). An association was evident for both cancer types associated with smoking (1.35, 1.10-1.66) and malignancies without an established smoking etiology (1.32, 1.12-1.56). The association between low stress resilience and mortality could partly be explained by tumor stage, marital status, and psychiatric comorbidity at cancer diagnosis.  Conclusions:   We observed an association between low stress resilience and mortality among men diagnosed with cancer, particularly oropharyngeal cancer, upper respiratory tract cancers, prostate cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma.

In this study, genetic, transcriptional, and epigenetic features of invasive cribriform carcinoma (ICC) tumors were compared with non-cribriform Gleason 4 (NC4) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. ICC (n = 164) had distinctive molecular features when compared with NC4 (n = 102). These include: (i) increased somatic copy number variations (SCNV), specifically deletions at 6q, 8p and 10q, which encompassed PTEN and MAP3K7 losses and gains at 3q; (ii) increased SPOP mut and ATMmut ; (iii) enrichment for mTORC1 and MYC pathways by gene expression; and (iv) increased methylation of selected genes. In addition, when compared with the metastatic prostate cancer, ICC clustered more closely to metastatic prostate cancer than NC4. Validation in clinical cohorts and genomically annotated murine models confirmed the association with SPOPmut (n = 38) and PTENloss (n = 818).

The PC-3AcT cells manifested increased tolerance to low-pH media with enhanced percent cell viability and increased resistance to docetaxel compared to their parental PC-3 cells. Arctigenin alone or in combination with docetaxel induced potent cytotoxicity. Preferential sensitization of PC-3AcT cells to arctigenin was accompanied by increased cell fractions with sub-G0/G1 peak and annexin V-PE(+), increased ROS levels, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP content, and inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. A series of changes caused by arctigenin were efficiently reversed through reducing ROS levels by radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine, thus placing ROS upstream of arctigenin-driven cytotoxicity.

This study investigates the impact of previous radiation for PCa on survival for patients with RCa.  Method:   We conducted a population-based study identifying men who underwent surgical treatment of RCa from 2002 to 2010. Patients were classified into three cohorts: no prior PCa, prior PCa treated without radiotherapy, and prior PCa treated with radiotherapy. The primary outcome was overall survival. Secondary outcomes included RCa surgical approach, ICU admission, length of stay, ER visits, and delayed formation of a new stoma.  Results:   Seven thousand ninety-six men underwent surgery for RCa; 6867 patients had no prior PCa, 58 had prior PCa treated without radiotherapy, and 171 had prior PCa treated with radiotherapy. The 5-year overall survival was 62% (95% CI 61-64%) for patients without prior PCa, 46% (95% CI 25-65%) for patients with prior PCa treated without radiotherapy, and 42% (95% CI 29-54%) for patients with prior PCa treated with radiotherapy (p < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, patients with prior PCa treated with radiotherapy were at increased risk of death (aHR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.69) compared to those without prior PCa. Furthermore, patients with prior PCa treated with radiotherapy had a significantly increased risk of resection with permanent stoma.  Conclusions:   Prior radiotherapy for PCa is a poor prognostic factor in RCa patients with significantly increased risk of death. Additionally, patients with prior radiotherapy for PCa are more likely to require a permanent stoma.""","""['Adina E Feinberg', 'Christopher J D Wallis', 'Robert K Nam', 'Usmaan Hameed']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Colorectal Dis""","""['Radiation therapy for prostate cancer increases the risk of subsequent rectal cancer.', 'Surgery for rectal cancer after high-dose radiotherapy for prostate cancer: is sphincter preservation relevant?', 'Brachytherapy Boost Utilization and Survival in Unfavorable-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'The impact of age at the time of radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer on the development of second primary malignancies.', 'Survival and Complications Following Surgery and Radiation for Localized Prostate Cancer: An International Collaborative Review.', 'Treatment of rectal cancer after previous prostate cancer: A single institution experience.', 'Prostate radiotherapy and the risk of secondary rectal cancer-a meta-analysis.']"""

We compare the spatial co-localization at sextant resolution of MRI lesions and histopathological mapping by combined targeted and extended systematic biopsies.  Materials and methods:   Sextants were mapped for sPC (ISUP group ≥ 2) by 24-core transperineal systematic biopsies in 316 patients with suspicion for sPC and by MR lesions of PI-RADS score of ≥ 3. The gold standard is combined systematic (median 23 cores) and targeted biopsies.  Results:   Of 316 men, 121 (38%) harbored sPC. Of these 121 patients, 4 (3%) had a negative MRI. MRI correctly identified 117/121 (97%) patients with sPC. In these patients, mpMRI missed no additional sPC in 96 (82%), while MRI-negative sPC lesions were present in 21 patients (18%). Of 1896 sextants, 379 (20%) harbored sPC. MR-positive sextants contained sPC in 26% (337/1275), compared to 7% (42/621) in MR-negative sextants. On a patient basis, sensitivity was 0.97, specificity 0.22, positive predictive value 0.43, and negative predictive value 0.91. On a sextant basis, sensitivity was 0.73, specificity 0.38, positive predictive value 0.26, and negative predictive value 0.93.  Conclusion:   MpMRI mapping agreed well with histopathology with, at the observed sPC prevalence and on a patient basis, excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value, and acceptable specificity and positive predictive value for sPC. However, 18% of sPC was outside the mpMRI mapped region, quantifying limitations of MRI for complete localization of disease extent.  Key points:   • Currently, exclusive MRI mapping of the prostate for focal treatment planning cannot be recommended, as significant prostate cancer may remain untreated in a substantial number of cases. • At the observed sPC prevalence and on a patient basis, mpMRI has excellent sensitivity and NPV, and acceptable specificity and PPV for detection of prostate cancer, supporting its use to detect suspicious lesions before biopsy. • Despite the excellent global performance, 18% of sPC was outside the mpMRI mapped region even when a security margin of 10 mm was considered, indicating that prostate MRI has limited ability to completely map all cancer foci within the prostate.""","""['David Bonekamp', 'Patrick Schelb', 'Manuel Wiesenfarth', 'Tristan Anselm Kuder', 'Fenja Deister', 'Albrecht Stenzinger', 'Joanne Nyarangi-Dix', 'Matthias Röthke', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Heinz-Peter Schlemmer', 'Jan Philipp Radtke']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Multicentre evaluation of targeted and systematic biopsies using magnetic resonance and ultrasound image-fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI to improve detection of prostate cancer compared with transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy alone: the PROMIS study.', 'Multicentre evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging supported transperineal prostate biopsy in biopsy-naïve men with suspicion of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'Intraoperative 3D-US-mpMRI Elastic Fusion Imaging-Guided Robotic Radical Prostatectomy: A Pilot Study.', 'Automated deep-learning system in the assessment of MRI-visible prostate cancer: comparison of advanced zoomed diffusion-weighted imaging and conventional technique.', 'Prospective evaluation of PI-RADS v2 and quantitative MRI for clinically significant prostate cancer detection in Indian men - East meets West.', ""Impact of Surgeon's Experience in Rigid versus Elastic MRI/TRUS-Fusion Biopsy to Detect Significant Prostate Cancer Using Targeted and Systematic Cores."", 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 68Ga Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography, and Respective Quantitative Parameters in Detection and Localization of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Intermediate- and High-Risk Group Patients: An Indian Demographic Study.']"""

The aim of the present study was to correlate tumor perfusion parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and clinical prognostic factors and further to explore the diagnostic value of DCE-MRI parameters in early stage prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Sixty-two newly diagnosed patients with histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma were enrolled in our prospective study. Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (12 cores, 6 on each lobe) was performed in each patient. Pathology was reviewed and graded according to the Gleason system. DCE-MRI was performed and analyzed using a two-compartmental model; quantitative parameters including volume transfer constant (K trans), reflux constant (K ep), and initial area under curve (iAUC) were calculated from the tumors and correlated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, and clinical stage.  Results: K trans (0.11 ± 0.02 min-1 versus 0.16 ± 0.06 min-1; p < 0.05), K ep (0.38 ± 0.08 min-1 versus 0.60 ± 0.23 min-1; p < 0.01), and iAUC (14.33 ± 2.66 mmoL/L/min versus 17.40 ± 5.97 mmoL/L/min; p < 0.05) were all lower in the clinical stage T1c tumors (tumor number, n=11) than that of tumors in clinical stage T2 (n=58). Serum PSA correlated with both tumor K trans (r=0.304, p < 0.05) and iAUC (r=0.258, p < 0.05).

We prospectively studied lipid-lowering medication use and both incident and fatal prostate cancer in black and white men in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. A total of 6,518 men without cancer at visit 2 (1990-1992), the start of the statin era, were followed for prostate cancer incidence and death through 2012. Medication use was collected during study visits and telephone calls at up to nine time points during follow-up.

Lipid-lowering medication use was modeled as time-dependent current use or duration (never, <10, and ≥10 years). By visit 4 (1996-1998), 21% of white and 11% of black men had used a lipid-lowering medication, mostly statins. There was a suggestion that current users were less likely to die from prostate cancer than nonusers (HR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.42-1.07) after multivariable adjustment. We observed no statistically significant differences between black and white men. Current use was not associated with incident prostate cancer, although long-term use was statistically significantly inversely associated with incidence (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.50-0.92).

However, diagnostic accuracy is affected by variability between radiologists.  Objective:   To determine the accuracy and variability in prostate mpMRI interpretation among radiologists, both individually and in teams, in a blinded fashion.  Design, setting, and participants:   A study cohort (n=32) was created from our prospective registry of patients who received prostate mpMRI with subsequent biopsy. The cohort was then independently reviewed by four radiologists of varying levels of experience, who assigned a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) classification, blinded to all clinical information. Consensus interpretation by teams of two radiologists was evaluated after a 12-wk wash-out period. Interpretive accuracy was calculated with various cutoffs for PI-RADS classification and Gleason score. Variability among individual radiologists and teams was calculated using the Fleiss kappa and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).  Results and limitations:   Using PI-RADS 3+/Gleason 7+ (p<0.01) and PI-RADS 4+/Gleason 6+ (p=0.02) as cutoffs, significant differences in accuracy among the four radiologists were noted. At no cutoff for PI-RADS classification or Gleason score did a team read achieve higher accuracy than the most accurate radiologist. The kappa and ICC ranged from 0.22 to 0.29 for the individuals and from 0.16 to 0.21 for the teams (poor agreement). A larger sample size may be needed to adequately power differences in accuracy among individual radiologists.  Conclusions:   At various cutoffs for PI-RADS classification and Gleason score, we find significant differences in individual radiologist accuracy, as well as a poor agreement among individual radiologists. Consensus interpretations-as teams of two radiologists-did not improve accuracy or reduce variability.

Itraconazole may have antitumor activity without affecting circulating androgen levels. We therefore evaluated itraconazole as a potentially noncastrating treatment approach in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer and PSADT ≤ 15 months, with serum testosterone > 150 ng/dL, were prospectively enrolled. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who experienced ≥ 50% decline from baseline in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) by week 12.  Results:   Twenty-one patients were enrolled. The median (range) age, baseline PSA, and PSADT at study entry was 72 (49-76) years, 7.6 (1.5-45.5) ng/mL, and 5.7 (1.2-13.0) months, respectively. Among 19 patients with evaluable data, 1 patient (5%) had a > 50% PSA decline. Nine patients (47%) experienced any PSA decline (mean decline 25.0%, range 2%-60%) by week 12. Among 10 patients without a PSA decline, the on-treatment versus pretreatment PSADT was not significantly longer (median 6.8 vs. 4.3 months, P = .17). There was no significant change from baseline to week 12 in serum testosterone (median change = 32.4%, P = .21) or androstenedione (median change = -8.3%, P = .85). The most common adverse events were edema (52%), fatigue (38%), hypertension (24%), and hypokalemia (24%).  Conclusion:   Itraconazole modulates serum PSA levels without lowering serum testosterone. However, the magnitude of effect is modest, and treatment carries risk of toxicities associated with mineralocorticoid excess.""","""['Mina Lee', 'Haemin Hong', 'Won Kim', 'Li Zhang', 'Terence W Friedlander', 'Lawrence Fong', 'Amy M Lin', 'Eric J Small', 'Xiao X Wei', 'Tammy J Rodvelt', 'Brigid Miralda', 'Brian Stocksdale', 'Charles J Ryan', 'Rahul Aggarwal']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['A non-comparative randomized phase II study of 2 doses of ATN-224, a copper/zinc superoxide dismutase inhibitor, in patients with biochemically recurrent hormone-naïve prostate cancer.', 'The change of PSA doubling time and its association with disease progression in patients with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer treated with intermittent androgen deprivation.', 'Dutasteride monotherapy in men with serologic relapse following radical therapy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a pilot study.', 'Prostate-specific antigen doubling time predicts response to deferred antiandrogen therapy in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Biochemical relapse after primary treatment for prostate cancer: studies on natural history and therapeutic considerations.', 'Itraconazole Reverts ABCB1-Mediated Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Signaling Pathways and Targeted Therapies for Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'Angiogenesis and Anti-Angiogenic Treatment in Prostate Cancer: Mechanisms of Action and Molecular Targets.', 'The Role of Smoothened-Dependent and -Independent Hedgehog Signaling Pathway in Tumorigenesis.', 'Bone microenvironment signaling of cancer stem cells as a therapeutic target in metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Although the molecular interactions between the bone microenvironment and cancer cells have been researched extensively, the relevance of the microvascular properties of prostate cancer bone metastases remains largely unknown. Most preclinical studies focusing on microvascular analyses are based on heterotopic tumor implantation, whereas the impact of the microenvironment on site-specific growth behavior and angiogenesis is rarely addressed.  Methods:   The microvascular changes associated with tumor growth in bone and soft tissue were characterized by implanting single cell suspensions of LnCap, Du145, and Pc3 cells into the femur (femur window) or striated muscle (dorsal skinfold chamber) of NSG mice. Tumor growth and the local microvasculature were analyzed for 21 days using intravital fluorescence microscopy.  Results:   The results showed a higher engraftment of tumor cells in bone than in striated muscle associated with accelerated growth of LnCap cells and Pc3 cells. Permeability, blood flow, and tissue perfusion rates were greater in bone than in striated muscle. Du145 cells showed similar growth behavior in both tissues with similar vascular properties. The bone microenvironment facilitated tumor engraftment and growth. Increased microvascular density in striated muscle led to a higher tumor burden during early growth, whereas the increased perfusion promoted later prostate cancer growth in bone.

In prostate cancer (PCa), Myc transcription factors are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of the full spectrum of PCa, from adenocarcinoma to advanced castration-resistant and neuroendocrine phenotypes. Though a high-value therapeutic target, clinically approved anti-Myc drugs have yet to be discovered. To elicit its oncogenic effects, Myc must form a heterodimer with its partner Max, which together bind DNA and activate transcription of a spectrum of target genes that promote cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis while blocking differentiation. In this study, we identified a binding site on the DNA-binding domain of the structurally ordered Myc-Max complex and employed a computer-aided rational drug discovery approach to identify small molecules that effectively inhibit Myc-Max functionality. A large-scale virtual screening protocol implementing structure-based methodologies was utilized to select a set of top-ranked compounds that were subsequently evaluated experimentally and characterized mechanistically for their ability to inhibit Myc-Max transcriptional activity and subsequent downstream functions, to reduce viability in PCa cell lines, disrupt protein-DNA interactions and to induce apoptosis as their mechanism of action. Among compounds identified that effectively inhibit Myc-Max activity with low to mid-micromolar range potency and no or minimal generic cytotoxicity, VPC-70067, a close analog of the previously identified Myc inhibitor 10058-F4, served as proof-of-concept that our in silico drug discovery strategy performed as expected. Compound VPC-70063, of a chemically different scaffold, was the best performer in a panel of in vitro assays, and the forerunner for future hit-to-lead optimization efforts. These findings lay a foundation for developing more potent, specific and clinically optimized Myc-Max inhibitors that may serve as promising therapeutics, alone or in combination with current anti-cancer treatments, for treatment of specific phenotypes or heterogeneous tumors.""","""['Lavinia A Carabet', 'Nada Lallous', 'Eric Leblanc', 'Fuqiang Ban', 'Helene Morin', 'Sam Lawn', 'Fariba Ghaidi', 'Joseph Lee', 'Ian G Mills', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Paul S Rennie', 'Artem Cherkasov']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Therapeutic Inhibition of Myc in Cancer.

As androgens stimulate erythropoiesis, ADT is associated with a reduction in hematocrit, which in turn contributes to fatigue and related morbidity. However, the mechanisms involved in ADT-induced reduction in erythropoiesis remain unclear. We conducted a 6-mo prospective cohort study and enrolled men with PCa about to undergo ADT (ADT-Group) and a control group of men who had previously undergone prostatectomy for localized PCa and were in remission (Non-ADT Group). All participants had normal testosterone levels at baseline. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline, 12 wk, and 24 wk after initiation of ADT; samples were obtained at the same intervals from enrollment in the Non-ADT group. Blood count, iron studies, erythropoietin, erythroferrone, and hepcidin levels were measured. Seventy participants formed the analytical sample (31 ADT, 39 Non-ADT). ADT was associated with a significant reduction in erythrocyte count (estimated mean difference = -0.2×106 cells/µl, 95%CI = -0.3 to -0.1×106 cells/µl, P < 0.001), hematocrit (-1.9%, 95%CI = -2.7 to -1.1%, P < 0.001), and hemoglobin (-0.6 g/dl, 95%CI = -0.8 to -0.3 g/dl, P < 0.001). Serum hepcidin concentration increased in the ADT-group (18 ng/ml, P < 0.001); however, iron concentrations did not change (-1.1 µg/dl, P = 0.837). Ferritin levels increased in men on ADT (60 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation, erythroferrone, and erythropoietin did not change.

However, literature is controversy about the real incremental value of DCE in detection of clinically significant (CS) prostate cancer (PCa), since absence of enhancement does not exclude cancer, and enhancement alone is not definitive for tumor.  Purpose:   To test the hypothesis that DCE images do not increase CS PCa detection on MRI prior to biopsy, comparing exams without and with contrast sequences. Material and Materials and Methods: All men who come to our institution to perform MRI on a 3T scanner without a prior diagnosis of CS PCa were invited to participate in this study. Reference standard was transrectal prostate US with systematic biopsy and MRI/US fusion biopsy of suspicious areas. Radiologists read the MRI images prospectively and independently (first only sequences without contrast, and subsequently the entire exam) and graded them on 5-points scale of cancer suspicion.  Results:   102 patients were included. Overall detection on biopsy showed CS cancer in 43 patients (42.2%), clinically non-significant cancer in 11 (10.8%) and negative results in 48 patients (47%). Positivities for CS PCa ranged from 8.9% to 9.8% for low suspicion and 75.0% to 88.9% for very high suspicion.

The PSA determination before 40 years seems interesting because it not suffers yet the drawbacks related to more advanced ages. Considering the scarcity of data on this topic, an analysis of PSA kinetics in this period seems interesting.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective assay in a database of a private diagnostic center was performed from 2003 to 2016. All subjects with a PSA before 40 years were included.  Results:   92995 patients performed PSA between the ages of 21 - 39. The mean value ranged from 0.66 ng / mL (at age 22) to 0.76 ng / mL (at age 39) and the overall mean was 0.73 ng / mL. As for outliers, 3783 individuals presented a baseline PSA > 1.6 ng / mL (p95). A linear regression model showed that each year there is a PSA increase of 0.0055 ng / mL (β = 0.0055; r² = 0.0020; p < 0.001). A plateau in PSA between 23 and 32 years was found and there were only minimal variations among the ages regardless of the evaluated percentile.  Conclusion:   It was demonstrated that PSA kinetics before 40 years is a very slow and progressive phenomenon regardless of the assessed percentile. Considering our results, it could be suggested that any PSA performed in this period could represent the baseline value without significant distortions.""","""['Cristiano Linck Pazeto', 'Thiago Fernandes Negris Lima', 'Jose Carlos Truzzi', 'Nairo Sumita', 'Jose de Sa', 'Fernando R Oliveira', 'Sidney Glina']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Serum prostate-specific antigen in a community-based population of healthy men.

Tobacco products excreted in the urine are hypothesized to cause tumor - promoting effects on urothelial cells through direct contact. We determined if moderate or severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) (defined as International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] ≥ 8) was associated with increased tumor recurrence.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively identified 70 consecutive men initially diagnosed with NMIBC at our institution from 2010 - 2016. Means were compared with independent T - test and proportions with chi - square analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine independent predictors of recurrence.  Results:   The majority of patients had Ta disease (58.6%) followed by T1 (28.6%) and Tis (12.9%). Forty - one (58.6%) patients had moderate or severe LUTS upon presentation within 30 days of initial TURBT with mean IPSS of 13.2 vs. 5.2 in the control group (p < 0.01). Biopsy - proven tumor recurrence occurred in 24 (34.3%) patients at mean follow-up of 31.7 months. Mean time to recurrence was 14.6 months. Moderate or severe LUTS was an independent predictor of tumor recurrence (odds ratio [OR]: 19.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.86 - 127; p = 0.002). Voiding or storage symptoms based on the IPSS did not independently correlate with tumor recurrence (p = 0.08 and p = 0.31, respectively) although total mean IPSS score did (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.07 - 1.47, p = 0.005).  Conclusions:   The presence of moderate or severe LUTS may be an important prognostic factor in NMIBC.

The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of additional features in patients undergoing RP in our clinic.  Materials and methods:   We studied 556 RP operations performed between 2009 and 2016 for prostate cancer at this clinic. Preoperative and postoperative data of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. RP specimens were examined by two pathologists specialized in this subject. Of these patients, 78 (14.02%) patients with PSM were included in the study. The pathology slides of these patients were reassessed. The length of PSM (mm), localization (apex, basis and posterolateral) and Gleason pattern at this margin was determined and statistical correlations with BCR were calculated.  Results:   The mean follow-up after the RP of 41 patients included in the study was 37.4 ± 13.2 months. During the follow-up period of the patients, BCR was observed in 16 patients (39.02%). No statistically significant difference was observed in age and prostate volume between the groups with and without BCR development (p > 0.05). Preoperative PSA level was found to be statistically significantly higher in the group with BCR development compared to the group without recurrence (p = 0.004). In-group comparisons in each aforementioned Gleason score groups were performed in terms of BCR development and the preoperative Gleason score in the group with development of recurrence was found to be statistically significantly higher compared to the group without recurrence (p = 0.007). The length of the surgical margin was measured as 7.4 ± 4.4 mm in the BCR-developing group and 4.7 ± 3.8 mm in the no-BCR- developing group; it was statistically significantly higher in the group with development of recurrence (p = 0.03).

Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis of data that were collected prospectively from January 2011 to June 2016 from patients who underwent prostate biopsy and subsequent radical prostatectomy. The study cohort was divided into two groups: US-MRI FB (Group A) and TRUS SRB (Group B). US-MRI FB was performed in patients with a previous MRI with a focal lesion with a Likert score ≥3; otherwise, a TRUS SRB was performed.  Results:   In total, 73 men underwent US-MRI FB, and 89 underwent TRUS SRB. The GU rate was higher in Group B (31.5% vs. 16.4%; p=0.027). According to the Gleason grade pattern, GU was higher in Group B than in Group A (40.4% vs. 23.3%; p=0.020). Analyses of the Gleason grading patterns showed that Gleason scores 3+4 presented less GU in Group A (24.1% vs. 52.6%; p=0.043).

The standard therapy for advanced PCa is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Although ADT, including bicalutamide treatment, is initially effective, resistance to bicalutamide frequently occurs and leads to the development of castration-resistant PCa. Thus, clarifying the mechanisms of bicalutamide resistance is urgently needed. We designed this study to assess the expression and function of PCDHB9, which encodes the protocadherin B9 protein. Methods The expression of PCDHB9 was determined using immunohistochemistry and a qRT-PCR. The effects of the overexpression or knockdown of PCDHB9 on cell growth, migration, adhesion were evaluated. To evaluate the PCDHB9-mediated effects in PCa, we performed a gene expression analysis using DU145 transfected with PCDHB9. We examined the effects of PCDHB9 inhibition on bicalutamide resistance. Results The qRT-PCR revealed that the expression of PCDHB9 was much higher in PCa than that in non-neoplastic prostate tissues. In 152 clinically localized PCa cases immunohistochemistry showed that 59% of PCa cases were positive for protocadherin B9. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression of protocadherin B9 was associated with PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy. A functional analysis showed that PCDHB9 modulated cell migration and adhesion. We also found that PCDHB9 induced the expression of ITGB6 based on a gene expression analysis. The effect of PCDHB9 inhibition on bicalutamide sensitivity was examined using MTT assays. The IC50 value of PCDHB9 siRNA-transfected PCa cells was significantly lower than that of negative control siRNA-transfected cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of protocadherin B9 in 74 PCa patients who were treated with androgen depletion therapy, including bicalutamide treatment, demonstrated that the high expression of protocadherin B9 was significantly associated with poor overall survival. Conclusions PCDHB9 plays an important role in the progression of PCa and bicalutamide resistance. Collectively, our results suggest that PCDHB9 targeted therapy may be more effective than bicalutamide alone.""","""['Yohei Sekino', 'Naohide Oue', 'Shoichiro Mukai', 'Yoshinori Shigematsu', 'Keisuke Goto', 'Naoya Sakamoto', 'Kazuhiro Sentani', 'Tetsutaro Hayashi', 'Jun Teishima', 'Akio Matsubara', 'Wataru Yasui']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Overexpression of PCDHB9 promotes peritoneal metastasis and correlates with poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.', 'Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) promotes bicalutamide resistance and is associated with survival in prostate cancer.', 'Interleukin-6 increases prostate cancer cells resistance to bicalutamide via TIF2.', 'Bicalutamide dosages used in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Endocrinotherapy resistance of prostate and breast cancer: Importance of the NF‑κB pathway (Review).', 'Identification of bicalutamide resistance-related genes and prognosis prediction in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Stress Reactivity, Susceptibility to Hypertension, and Differential Expression of Genes in Hypertensive Compared to Normotensive Patients.', 'KIFC1 Is Associated with Basal Type, Cisplatin Resistance, PD-L1 Expression and Poor Prognosis in Bladder Cancer.', 'HOXB5 Overexpression Is Associated with Neuroendocrine Differentiation and Poor Prognosis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Overexpression of claspin promotes docetaxel resistance and is associated with prostate-specific antigen recurrence in prostate cancer.']"""

Remarkably, due to the improved delivery to the tumour tissue upon aggregation, we have succeeded in reducing the doses of CAP-based drugs in vivo in prostate cancer by two orders of magnitude while maintaining a substantial antitumor activity.""","""['Angel Sampedro', 'Ágata Ramos-Torres', 'Christian Schwöppe', 'Christian Mück-Lichtenfeld', 'Ingo Helmers', 'Alicia Bort', 'Inés Díaz-Laviada', 'Gustavo Fernández']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Angew Chem Int Ed Engl""","""['Near-infrared emitting fluorescent homobimetallic gold(I) complexes displaying promising in\xa0vitro and in\xa0vivo therapeutic properties.', 'Design, synthesis and cytotoxicity of BODIPY FL labelled triterpenoids.', 'Amphiphilic redox-sensitive NIR BODIPY nanoparticles for dual-mode imaging and photothermal therapy.', 'Effect of capsaicin on prostate cancer cells.', 'Fluorescent indicators based on BODIPY.', 'Capsaicin: A Two-Decade Systematic Review of Global Research Output and Recent Advances Against Human Cancer.', 'BODIPY Conjugates as Functional Compounds for Medical Diagnostics and Treatment.', 'Recent progress and future challenges in the supramolecular polymerization of metal-containing monomers.', 'Redox responsive activity regulation in exceptionally stable supramolecular assembly and co-assembly of a protein.', 'Impact of Positional Isomerism on Pathway Complexity in Aqueous Media.']"""

At present, prostate-specific antigen levels are widely used to diagnose PCa in the clinic, but they are not sufficient for an accurate early diagnosis or prognosis.  Methods:   To identify potential molecular markers for PCa, we used real-time PCR to measure the expression levels of various microRNAs, including miR-1825, miR-484, miR-205, miR-141, and let-7b, in the serum of 72 PCa patients and 34 healthy controls.  Results:   miR-1825, miR-484, miR-205, miR-141, and let-7b were shown to be highly specific for PCa, suggesting that they could be used as PCa tumor screening biomarkers. miR-205 may also be used as a biomarker for indicating bone metastasis in PCa patients, miR-1825 levels may help indicate tumor-node-metastasis classification, the evaluation of treatment effects, and determining prognosis, while let-7b levels may indicate potential tumor malignancy and the hormone resistance status and could be used as a basis to adjust individual treatments for the high-risk, early diagnosis of refractory PCa.

Eighteen patients were suitable for inclusion. Axial T2w images were obtained using the WPC and ERC, and DWI images were obtained using the WPC, ERC, and PPA. Analysis was performed in consensus by two readers with experience in prostate MRI. The readers scored the T2w images using six qualitative criteria and the DWI images using five criteria. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was also measured.  Results:   T2w artifact severity was greater for an ERC than a WPC (p = 0.003). There was no significant difference in T2w qualititatve image quality by other measures. The distinction of zonal anatomy on DWI was superior for an ERC compared with both a WPC and a PPA (p = 0.018 and p < 0.001 respectively), and there was no significant difference in DWI image quality by other measures. SNR was significantly higher for ERC imaging for both T2w and DWI.  Conclusion:   WPC imaging provides comparable image quality to that of an ERC, potentially reducing the need for an ERC. WPC imaging shows reduced T2w artifact severity and inferior DWI zonal anatomy distinction compared with an ERC.

Methods:   This study retrospectively analyzed 54 consecutive patients with PCa who underwent 99mTc-labeled PSMA-based image-guided surgery between January 2016 and September 2017. These patients received a radical prostatectomy (RP) with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) or salvage lymph node dissection (sLND).

Results:   In 31 patients, PSMA single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography (CT) could find 52 suspicious lymph node metastases (LNMs). With the help of PSMA SPECT/CT, 12 patients with recurrence received sLND, 19 primary PCa patients received RP with extended PLND, and 23 primary PCa patients received RP with standard PLND. The findings showed that PSMA SPECT/CT could detect LNMs with high sensitivity and specificity. In six patients, PSMA SPECT/CT could find more LNMs that were not found by MRI and help to modify the extent of lymphadenectomy. At the latest follow-up evaluation, 39 patients showed a biochemical response (BR), 9 patients showed a biochemical recurrence (BCR) after BR, and 6 patients never exhibited BR. The patients who received RP with standard PLND or extended PLND had a better prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response than the patients who received sLND. The patients with pelvic LNMs also had a better PSA response than the patients with retroperitoneal LNMs.  Conclusions:   This study showed that 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT-guided surgery can remove more LNMs than conventional imaging with high sensitivity and specificity and delay disease progression in PCa patients.""","""['Heng-Chuan Su', 'Yao Zhu', 'Si-Long Hu', 'Chang Liu', 'Guo-Wen Lin', 'Bo Dai', 'Ying-Jian Zhang', 'Ding-Wei Ye']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['99mTc-PSMA targeted robot-assisted radioguided surgery during radical prostatectomy and extended lymph node dissection of prostate cancer patients.', 'Metastases-yield and Prostate-specific Antigen Kinetics Following Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Prostate Cancer: A Comparison Between Conventional Surgical Approach and Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-radioguided Surgery.', 'Prospective evaluation of 68Gallium-prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography for preoperative lymph node staging in prostate cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-guided salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer: a novel technology to detect lymph node metastases.', 'A Review on the Current State and Future Perspectives of 99mTcTc-Housed PSMA-i in Prostate Cancer.', 'Single-fraction image-guided robotic radiosurgery efficiently controls local prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', '99mTc-PSMA targeted robot-assisted radioguided surgery during radical prostatectomy and extended lymph node dissection of prostate cancer patients.', 'Molecular Imaging in Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer Patients: Current Aspects and Future Trends.', 'Direct comparison of 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

In this large Swedish cohort study consisting of a total of nearly 180,000 older men, we found that those with prostate cancer and ADT have a significantly increased risk of future osteoporotic fractures.  Introduction:   Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients with prostate cancer is associated to increased risk of fractures. In this study, we investigated the relationship between ADT in patients with prostate cancer and the risk of incident fractures and non-skeletal fall injuries both compared to those without ADT and compared to patients without prostate cancer.  Methods:   We included 179,744 men (79.1 ± 7.9 years (mean ± SD)) from the Swedish registry to which national directories were linked in order to study associations regarding fractures, fall injuries, morbidity, mortality and medications. We identified 159,662 men without prostate cancer, 6954 with prostate cancer and current ADT and 13,128 men with prostate cancer without ADT. During a follow-up of approximately 270,300 patient-years, we identified 10,916 incident fractures including 4860 hip fractures.  Results:   In multivariable Cox regression analyses and compared to men without prostate cancer, those with prostate cancer and ADT had increased risk of any fracture (HR 95% CI 1.40 (1.28-1.53)), hip fracture (1.38 (1.20-1.58)) and MOF (1.44 (1.28-1.61)) but not of non-skeletal fall injury (1.01 (0.90-1.13)). Patients with prostate cancer without ADT did not have increased risk of any fracture (0.97 (0.90-1.05)), hip fracture (0.95 (0.84-1.07)), MOF (1.01 (0.92-1.12)) and had decreased risk of non-skeletal fall injury (0.84 (0.77-0.92)).  Conclusions:   Patients with prostate cancer and ADT is a fragile patient group with substantially increased risk of osteoporotic fractures both compared to patients without prostate cancer and compared to those with prostate cancer without ADT.

All CRPC patients with at least one prescription of AA and/or ENZ between September 2013 and August 2016 in the pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy setting were extracted and matched to the Austrian death and hospital admission statistics. Drug adherence was estimated by the medication possession ratio (MPR).  Results:   Data of 457 patients (mean age: 74.4 ± 8.5 years) were analyzed. The mean MPR was 90% for AA, 85% for ENZ and 88% for the sequence therapy cohort.

SSeCKS is downregulated in the metastases of many human cancer types, and its forced re-expression suppresses the metastatic behavior of prostate cancer cells. SSeCKS is also downregulated in breast and prostate cancer stroma, and SSeCKS-null mice (KO) are metastasis-prone, suggesting a role in suppressing formation of the pre-metastatic niche. Here, we show that lung colonization and metastasis formation by B16F10 and SM1WT1[Braf V600E] mouse melanoma cells is 9-fold higher in syngeneic KO compared to WT hosts, although there is no difference in orthotopic tumor volumes. Although melanoma cells adhered equally to KO or WT lung fibroblasts (LF), co-injection of melanoma cells with KO (vs. WT) LF increased lung macrometastasis formation in WT hosts, marked by increased melanoma colonization at foci of leaky vasculature. Increased melanoma adhesion on KO lung endothelial cells (LEC) was facilitated by increased E-Selectin levels and by increased STAT3-regulated secretion of senescence-associated factors from KO-LF, such as Vegf. Finally, the ability of SSeCKS to attenuate IFNα-induced Stat3 activation in KO-LF required its Src-scaffolding domain. Taken together, these data suggest that SSeCKS normally suppresses metastatic colonization in the lung by attenuating the expression of Selectin adhesion proteins, which can be controlled autonomously by local endothelial cells or enhanced by senescence factors secreted by neighboring fibroblasts in a SSeCKS-regulated, Src/Stat3-dependent manner.""","""['Masashi Muramatsu', 'Shin Akakura', 'Lingqiu Gao', 'Jennifer Peresie', 'Benjamin Balderman', 'Irwin H Gelman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['SSeCKS/AKAP12 scaffolding functions suppress B16F10-induced peritoneal metastasis by attenuating CXCL9/10 secretion by resident fibroblasts.', 'Carcinogen-induced squamous papillomas and oncogenic progression in the absence of the SSeCKS/AKAP12 metastasis suppressor correlate with FAK upregulation.', 'SSeCKS/Gravin/AKAP12 inhibits cancer cell invasiveness and chemotaxis by suppressing a protein kinase C- Raf/MEK/ERK pathway.', 'Suppression of tumor and metastasis progression through the scaffolding functions of SSeCKS/Gravin/AKAP12.', 'The role of SSeCKS/gravin/AKAP12 scaffolding proteins in the spaciotemporal control of signaling pathways in oncogenesis and development.', 'AKAP12 ameliorates liver injury via targeting PI3K/AKT/PCSK6 pathway.', 'Rethinking the biology of metastatic melanoma: a holistic approach.', 'Potential antitumor activity of digitoxin and user-designed analog administered to human lung cancer cells.', 'Lung-Seeking Metastases.']"""

Molecular chaperones play a key role in the regulation of protein homeostasis and are potential targets for overcoming chemoresistance.Experimental Design: We established 4 chemoresistant prostate cancer cell lines and used image-based high-content siRNA functional screening, based on gene-expression signature, to explore mechanisms of chemoresistance and identify new potential targets with potential roles in taxane resistance. The functional role of a new target was assessed by in vitro and in vivo silencing, and mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify its downstream effectors.  Results:   We identified FKBP7, a prolyl-peptidyl isomerase overexpressed in docetaxel-resistant and in cabazitaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells. This is the first study to characterize the function of human FKBP7 and explore its role in cancer. We discovered that FKBP7 was upregulated in human prostate cancers and its expression correlated with the recurrence observed in patients receiving docetaxel. FKBP7 silencing showed that FKBP7 is required to maintain the growth of chemoresistant cell lines and chemoresistant tumors in mice. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that FKBP7 interacts with eIF4G, a component of the eIF4F translation initiation complex, to mediate the survival of chemoresistant cells. Using small-molecule inhibitors of eIF4A, the RNA helicase component of eIF4F, we were able to kill docetaxel- and cabazitaxel-resistant cells.

The aim of the study is to evaluate screening effect on prostate cancer incidence and mortality in relation to number of screening rounds attended.Experimental Design: The participants in the screening arm of the Finnish trial (31,867 men) were classified according to screening attendance in a time-dependent fashion. Initially, all men in the screening arm were regarded as nonattenders until the first screening attendance, then remained among the once-screened until the second screen and similarly for the possible third round. The control arm was the reference. Follow-up started at randomization and ended at death, emigration, or end of 2013. Prostate cancer incidence and mortality, as well lung cancer and overall mortality were evaluated.  Results:   Prostate cancer incidence was increased among screened men, but was not directly related to the number of screening rounds. Prostate cancer mortality was decreased in men screened twice or three times, but did not materially differ in those who did not attend the screening, and in men screened once compared with the control arm. The largest mortality reduction was in men screened three times [HR 0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.09-0.33]. However, a reduction was also seen in lung cancer (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.73) and overall mortality (HR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.52-0.60).  Conclusions:   Assuming a similar relative reduction being due to selection bias and screening in prostate cancer as other causes of death (40% reduction), approximately half of the observed prostate cancer mortality reduction by repeated screening is likely to be noncausal and a real screening effect may account for up to 40% reduction in men screened three times.

They were given a qualitative rating based on how well they provided information on factors such as preparation for the procedure, mechanism of the procedure and possible side effects. Data were also collected on view count, country of origin, likes, and dislikes.  Results:   A total of 41 videos were reviewed, with no videos achieving an ""excellent"" rating, 32 being rated as ""very poor"", and only one rated as ""good"". Despite the poor-quality information, 39 of the videos were from healthcare organisations or individual surgeons.

Materials and methods:   The medical records of consecutive ONU and LNU cases from five tertiary institutions were retrospectively analyzed between 2000 and 2012. The propensity-score matching methodology was used to compare the two surgical approaches in terms of age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, tumor location, grade, pathologic T and N categories, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, and follow-up duration. The Kaplan-Meier with log-rank tests and clustered Cox regression were used to compare the estimated rates of survival for each surgical approach and to investigate the effect of the surgical approach on each prognostic outcome.  Results:   Six hundred thirty-eight propensity-score matching pairs (n=1,276) were compared; LNU was significantly better than ONU in all types of survival, including intravesical recurrencefree survival (IVRFS), disease-free survival, overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) (p < 0.05). The 3-year OS and CSS rates were significantly higher with LNU than with ONU (p < 0.05). Compared with ONU, LNU had significantly better 3-year OS and CSS rates (82.9% and 86.2% vs. 78.3% and 81.8%); there were no differences at 5 years. In subgroup analysis of the early-staged group, advanced-stage group, lymph node-positive group, and lymph node-negative group, the two approaches did not significantly affect prognostic outcomes, except LNU improved the IVRFS in the lymph node-negative or no history of previous bladder cancer group.

TRPM4 is involved in different physiological processes such as T cell activation and the migration of endothelial and certain immune cells. Overexpression of this channel has been reported in various types of tumors including prostate cancer. In this study, a significant overexpression of TRPM4 was found only in samples from cancer with a Gleason score higher than 7, which are more likely to spread. To evaluate whether TRPM4 overexpression was related to the spreading capability of tumors, TRPM4 was knockdown by using shRNAs in PC3 prostate cancer cells and the effect on cellular migration and invasion was analyzed. PC3 cells with reduced levels of TRPM4 (shTRPM4) display a decrease of the migration/invasion capability. A reduction in the expression of Snail1, a canonical epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor, was also observed. Consistently, these cells showed a significant change in the expression of key EMT markers such as MMP9, E-cadherin/N-cadherin, and vimentin, indicating a partial reversion of the EMT process. Whereas, the overexpression of TRPM4 in LnCaP cells resulted in increased levels of Snail1, reduction in the expression of E-cadherin and increase in their migration potential. This study suggests a new and indirect mechanism of regulation of migration/invasion process by TRPM4 in prostate cancer cells, by inducing the expression of Snail1 gene and consequently, increasing the EMT.""","""['Alfredo I Sagredo', 'Eduardo A Sagredo', 'Victor Pola', 'César Echeverría', 'Rodrigo Andaur', 'Luis Michea', 'Andrés Stutzin', 'Felipe Simon', 'Katherine Marcelain', 'Ricardo Armisén']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 channel contributes to migration of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-150 suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis in prostate cancer through the TRPM4-mediated β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'ETS1 induces transforming growth factor β signaling and promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells.', 'TRPM4 in Cancer-A New Potential Drug Target.', 'TRPM4 channel and cancer.', 'Monitoring trafficking and expression of hemagglutinin-tagged transient receptor potential melastatin 4 channel in mammalian cells.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'On the modulation of TRPM channels: Current perspectives and anticancer therapeutic implications.', 'Recent Developments on the Roles of Calcium Signals and Potential Therapy Targets in Cervical Cancer.', 'The interplay between physical cues and mechanosensitive ion channels in cancer metastasis.']"""

However, contemporary data are unavailable. We described community-based NIT rates within 16 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries between 2010 and 2014.  Patients and methods:   We identified 23,360 PCa patients who fulfilled the University of California San Francisco AS criteria (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] < 10 ng/mL, clinical T stage ≤ T2a, Gleason score ≤ 6, and positive cores < 33%). Annual NIT rates as well as patient distribution according to PSA, age, number of positive cores, and clinical T stage were studied. Multivariable logistic regression analysis tested NIT predictors.  Results:   Between 2010 and 2014, the NIT rate increased from 30.2% to 57.5% (P = .004). Within 16 SEER registries, NIT rates ranged from 25.9% to 62%. NIT rate increased uniformly within all examined registries. Of patient and tumor characteristics (PSA > 4 ng/mL, cT2a and > 1 positive core) only the proportion of NIT patients aged < 65 years increased over time from 47.3% to 53.2% (P = .03). By multivariable logistic regression analysis predicting NIT rate, older age (odd ratio [OR] = 1.05), more contemporary year of diagnosis (OR = 1.41), and being unmarried (OR = 1.45) and uninsured (OR = 2.41) were independent predictors.  Conclusion:   The NIT rate has markedly increased across all examined SEER registries. Nonetheless, important differences distinguish those who received high-end NIT from low-end NIT. PCa characteristics of NIT patients remained unchanged over time. However, in addition to geographical differences in NIT rates, patient characteristics such as age, marital status, and insurance status represent potential NIT access barriers.""","""['Marco Bandini', 'Sebastiano Nazzani', 'Michele Marchioni', 'Felix Preisser', 'Zhe Tian', 'Marco Moschini', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Markus Graefen', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Fred Saad', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Contemporary Management of Prostate Cancer Patients Suitable for Active Surveillance: A North American Population-based Study.', 'Inverse stage migration patterns in North American patients undergoing local prostate cancer treatment: a contemporary population-based update in light of the 2012 USPSTF recommendations.', 'A National Survey of Radiation Oncologists and Urologists on Perceived Attitudes and Recommendations of Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'Adverse upgrading and/or upstaging in contemporary low-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Rethinking prostate cancer screening: could MRI be an alternative screening test?']"""

Objective:   To assess the accuracy of available tools to predict LNI and to develop a novel model for men diagnosed via MRI-targeted biopsies.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 497 patients diagnosed via MRI-targeted biopsies and treated with RP and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) at five institutions were retrospectively identified.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Three available models predicting LNI were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analyses. A nomogram predicting LNI was developed and internally validated.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 62 patients (12.5%) had LNI. The median number of nodes removed was 15. The AUC for the Briganti 2012, Briganti 2017, and MSKCC nomograms was 82%, 82%, and 81%, respectively, and their calibration characteristics were suboptimal. A model including PSA, clinical stage and maximum diameter of the index lesion on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), grade group on targeted biopsy, and the presence of clinically significant PCa on concomitant systematic biopsy had an AUC of 86% and represented the basis for a coefficient-based nomogram. This tool exhibited a higher AUC and higher net benefit compared to available models developed using standard biopsies. Using a cutoff of 7%, 244 ePLNDs (57%) would be spared and a lower number of LNIs would be missed compared to available nomograms (1.6% vs 4.6% vs 4.5% vs 4.2% for the new nomogram vs Briganti 2012 vs Briganti 2017 vs MSKCC).  Conclusions:   Available models predicting LNI are characterized by suboptimal accuracy and clinical net benefit for patients diagnosed via MRI-targeted biopsies. A novel nomogram including mpMRI and MRI-targeted biopsy data should be used to identify candidates for ePLND in this setting.  Patient summary:   We developed the first nomogram to predict lymph node invasion (LNI) in prostate cancer patients diagnosed via magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy undergoing radical prostatectomy.

Nevertheless, here we elucidate the synthesis, characterization and theoretical study of bio-active small molecule 4-hydroxy-3,4'-bichromenyl-2,2'-dione (4HBD). Then we have illuminated the binding interactions of 4HBD with calf thymus DNA (ctDNA), which is particularly designed for biological application. Extensive investigations of the binding of 4HBD with ctDNA are provided by utilizing multi-spectroscopic and molecular docking approaches, including UV-vis absorbance, steady-state, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism study. The calculated binding and quenching constant value from quantitative data analysis of absorption and emission spectroscopy shows that 4HBD binds to the ctDNA groove. Further confirmation of the same is found by comparative displacement and iodide quenching studies. Negative enthalpy, negative free energy and positive entropy change imply a hydrophobic force monitors the association of 4HBD with the biomacromolecule. Interestingly the small molecule (4HBD) shows potential anti-bacterial activity against the model pathogenic gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. The noncytotoxic nature of the 4HBD is demonstrated in vitro with the help of MTT assay by normal kidney epithelial (NKE), breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and human prostate cancer cell (PC3) lines.

We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of HRS use for reduction in radiation therapy (RT) toxicities in patients with prostate cancer (PC) undergoing external beam RT (EBRT).  Methods and materials:   A multistate Markov model was constructed from the U.S. payer perspective to examine the cost-effectiveness of HRS in men with localized PC receiving EBRT (EBRT alone vs EBRT + HRS). The subgroups analyzed included site of HRS placement (hospital outpatient, physician office, ambulatory surgery center) and proportion of patients with good baseline erectile function (EF). Data on EF, gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities incidence, and potential risks associated with HRS implantation were obtained from a recently published randomized clinical trial. Health utilities and costs were derived from the literature and the 2018 Physician Fee Schedule and were discounted 3% annually. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were modeled for a 5-year period from receipt of RT. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and value-based threshold analyses were conducted.  Results:   The per-patient 5-year incremental cost for spacers administered in a hospital outpatient setting was $3578, and the incremental effectiveness was 0.0371 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $96,440/QALY for patients with PC undergoing HRS insertion in a hospital and $39,286/QALY for patients undergoing HRS insertion in an ambulatory facility. For men with good baseline EF, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $35,548/QALY and $9627/QALY in hospital outpatient and ambulatory facility settings, respectively.

Our results showed that miR-93 was significantly upregulated in human PC tissues and several PC cell lines, and its overexpression was correlated with poor survival in PC patients. Furthermore, functional analysis showed that miR-93 overexpression promoted the migration, invasion and proliferation of PC-3 cells transfected with miR-93 mimics, while its knockdown displayed an opposite result in DU145 cells following miR-93 inhibitor transfection. Additionally, in vivo tumorigenic studies on nude mice confirmed that miR-93 mimic treatment accelerated the growth of PC-3 xenograft tumors. As expected, GTP (25, 50 and 100 μg/ml) inhibited growth of PC-3 cells via inducing apoptosis, which was achieved by elevation of bax/bcl-2 ratio and caspae-3 protein expression, as well as a decrease of miR-93.

This study investigated the feasibility of building a deep convolutional neural network for MRI-based S-CT generation and evaluated the dosimetric accuracy on prostate IMRT planning.  Methods:   A paired CT and T2-weighted MR images were acquired from each of 51 prostate cancer patients. Fifteen pairs were randomly chosen as tested set and the remaining 36 pairs as training set. The training subjects were augmented by applying artificial deformations and feed to a two-dimensional U-net which contains 23 convolutional layers and 25.29 million trainable parameters. The U-net represents a nonlinear function with input an MR slice and output the corresponding S-CT slice. The mean absolute error (MAE) of Hounsfield unit (HU) between the true CT and S-CT images was used to evaluate the HU estimation accuracy. IMRT plans with dose 79.2 Gy prescribed to the PTV were applied using the true CT images. The true CT images then were replaced by the S-CT images and the dose matrices were recalculated on the same plan and compared to the one obtained from the true CT using gamma index analysis and absolute point dose discrepancy.  Results:   The U-net was trained from scratch in 58.67 h using a GP100-GPU. The computation time for generating a new S-CT volume image was 3.84-7.65 s. Within body, the (mean ± SD) of MAE was (29.96 ± 4.87) HU. The 1%/1 mm and 2%/2 mm gamma pass rates were over 98.03% and 99.36% respectively. The DVH parameters discrepancy was less than 0.87% and the maximum point dose discrepancy within PTV was less than 1.01% respect to the prescription.

CircAGO2 is up-regulated in gastric cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and neuroblastoma, and is associated with poor prognosis of patients. CircAGO2 promotes the growth, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies reveal that circAGO2 physically interacts with human antigen R (HuR) protein to facilitate its activation and enrichment on the 3'-untranslated region of target genes, resulting in reduction of AGO2 binding and repression of AGO2/miRNA-mediated gene silencing associated with cancer progression. Pre-clinically, administration of lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA targeting circAGO2 inhibits the expression of downstream target genes, and suppresses the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of xenografts in nude mice. In addition, blocking the interaction between circAGO2 and HuR by cell-penetrating inhibitory peptide represses the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of cancer cells.

We tested these genes in a functional genomics screen in a panel of three prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, DU145), using RNA interference. The screen revealed several genes whose knockdown caused strong growth inhibition in all cell lines. Additionally, we tested the gene set in the presence of docetaxel to see whether any gene exhibited additive or synergistic effects with the drug. We observed a strong synergistic effect between DLGAP5 knockdown and docetaxel in the androgen-sensitive line LNCaP, but not in the two other androgen-independent lines. We then tested whether this effect was connected to androgen pathways and found that knockdown of the androgen receptor by si-RNA attenuated the synergy significantly. Similarly, androgen desensitized LNCaP-AI cells had a higher IC50 to docetaxel and did not exhibit the synergistic interaction. Short-term exposure to enzalutamide did not significantly alter the behaviour of parental LNCaP cells. An immunofluorescence analysis in LNCaP cells suggests that under the double insult of DLGAP5 knockdown and docetaxel, cells predominantly arrest in metaphase. In contrast, the knockdown of the androgen receptor by siRNA appears to assist cells to progress through metaphase in to anaphase, even in the presence of docetaxel.

Overall survival according to patient subsets (nondiabetic patients, diabetic metformin patients, and diabetic non-metformin patients) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank testing. Multivariate analysis of factors affecting overall survival was then performed through Cox regression analysis.  Results:   A total of 1600 patients were enrolled into the current study, of which 147 patients were diabetic patients receiving metformin, 116 patients were diabetic patients not receiving metformin, and 1337 were nondiabetic patients. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, no evidence for overall survival difference was found among the 3 patient subsets (diabetic metformin patients, diabetic non-metformin patients, and nondiabetic patients) (P = .908). The following factors were predictive of worse overall survival in multivariate analysis: lower hemoglobin (P < .0001), lower body mass index (P = .041), shorter docetaxel treatment (P < .0001), and higher M1 sub-stage (P = .016).

Earlier reports indicated that it exerts antioxidant activity. We hypothesized that maclurin exerts antioxidant activity and anti-cancer effects in small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (SCNCs), a very aggressive type of human prostate cancer. To verify our hypothesis, we selected PC3 cells as a model system and investigated the antioxidant activity and anti-cancer effects of maclurin. In the reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection assay for the verification of antioxidant activity, we observed the unexpected prooxidant activity of maclurin in PC3 cells. For the anti-cancer activities, we investigated the effects of maclurin on induction of apoptosis and inhibition of metastatic characteristics of PC3 cells. In the apoptosis assay, maclurin significantly induced apoptosis of PC3 cells. Maclurin also showed significant anti-metastatic effects. Maclurin inhibited cell migration in a dosage-dependent manner. In addition, the gelatin zymography assay indicated that maclurin inhibited activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) that affect cell migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Then, we investigated the effects of maclurin on the cancer-related signaling molecules. Maclurin activated p38 signaling and inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), focal-adhesion kinase (FAK), AKT, and c-Myc signalings in PC3 cells. Finally, we observed prooxidant activity and anti-SCNC effects of maclurin in DU145 cells. This suggests that the effects of maclurin may not be specifically limited to PC3 cells.

Performing a wider excision of peri-prostatic tissue helps achieve negative surgical margins, but can compromise urinary and sexual function. Alternatively, sparing peri-prostatic tissue to maintain functional outcomes may result in an increased risk of cancer recurrence. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of providing surgeons with detailed information about their patient outcomes through a surgical report card.  Methods:   We propose a prospective cohort quasi-experimental study. The intervention is the provision of feedback to prostate cancer surgeons via surgical report cards. These report cards will be distributed every 3 months by email and will present surgeons with detailed information, including urinary function, erectile function, and surgical margin outcomes of their patients compared to patients treated by other de-identified surgeons in the study. For the first 12 months of the study, pre-operative, 6-month, and 12-month patient data will be collected but there will be no report cards distributed to surgeons. This will form the pre-feedback cohort. After the pre-feedback cohort has completed accrual, surgeons will receive quarterly report cards. Patients treated after the provision of report cards will comprise the post-feedback cohort. The primary comparison will be post-operative function of the pre-feedback cohort vs. post-feedback cohort. The secondary comparison will be the proportion of patients with positive surgical margins in the two cohorts. Outcomes will be stratified or case-mix adjusted, as appropriate. Assuming a baseline potency of 20% and a baseline continence of 70%, 292 patients will be required for 80% power at an alpha of 5% to detect a 10% improvement in functional outcomes. Assuming 30% of patients may be lost to follow-up, a minimum sample size of 210 patients is required in the pre-feedback cohort and 210 patients in the post-feedback cohort.

Conclusions:   In vitro, miR-618 overexpression decreases TIMP-1 and miR-618 inhibition decreases MMP-9, suggesting that miR-618 might be an oncomiR. However, the analysis of clinical samples of localized prostate cancer revealed an inconsistent pattern, as increased miR-618 expression was associated with lower Gleason score and pathological status.

PACE4, a member of the proprotein convertase family of enzymes, has been shown to play a major role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, through the formation of an oncogenic isoform named PACE4-altCT. PACE4 isoforms have also been suggested to play a role in other cancers, including thyroid cancer, but have never been investigated in a detailed manner. Our objective is to compare the histochemical distribution of the two major PACE4 isoforms in benign and malignant thyroid nodules, in order to determine their potential usefulness as discriminatory biomarkers.  Methods:   Thyroid tissues of patients who underwent thyroidectomy were classified according to final pathology. Corresponding tissue sections were immunostained, using two previously validated antibodies raised against the C-terminal end of the two PACE4 isoforms, namely the full-length PACE4 protein (PACE4-FL) and its alternative isoform (PACE4-altCT). Nodules were compared with adjacent normal parenchyma and immunostaining was rated as ""low"" or ""high"" by a head and neck pathologist.  Results:   Non-lesional thyroid parenchyma did not express PACE4-FL (p = 0.002). As a group, malignant (n = 17) nodules expressed PACE4-FL significantly more than benign (n = 24) nodules (percentage of high immunostaining: 52.9% vs 4.2%; p = 0.001). Reciprocally, there was a statistically lower expression of PACE4-altCT in malignant nodules than in adjacent non-lesional parenchyma (p = 0.014). The specificity of a high PACE4-FL immunostaining in determining malignancy was 95.8% (95% CI, 78.9% to 99.9%).  Conclusion:   This study supports the previously described relationship between PACE4-FL and PACE4-altCT through alternative splicing. It also suggests that PACE4-FL is a promising biomarker for thyroid malignancy. Its high specific expression for malignancy could make it an interesting ""rule in"" test for thyroid cancer. Further prospective, quantitative studies are currently being designed to address how measurements of PACE4 isoforms could be used in a clinical setting.

The aim of this study was to establish the effects of M4, uroA, and their combinations on LNCaP cells, an androgen dependent prostate cancer in vitro model.. The LNCaP cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of tested metabolites. The cell proliferation was determined by measurement of DNA-bisbenzimide H 33 258 complexes fluorescence. The isobolographic analysis was used to establish the type of interaction between metabolites. The apoptosis, androgen receptor (AR) localization, and phosphorylation of Akt kinase were measured by flow cytometry. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) secretion was determined by ELISA. M4 showed modest antiproliferative activity in LNCaP cells (IC50 = 117 µM; CI: 81 - 154). UroA decreased proliferation (IC50 = 32.7 µM; CI: 24.3 - 41.1) and induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells. The mixture of M4 with uroA had synergistic antiproliferative effect. Moreover, M4 potentiated inhibition of PSA secretion and enhanced retention of AR in cytoplasm caused by uroA. Interestingly, uroA increased levels of pSer473 Akt in LNCaP cells.

The precise effects of overexpression of these two key oncogenes on the regulation of metabolic pathways in prostate cancer are under active investigation; however, few studies have investigated their bivariate oncogene-pair expressions in metabolic prostate cancer phenotypes. This is primarily due to the lack of a suitable statistical method to analyze the data in the presence of oncogene interactions and within-metabolite-set correlations.  Methods:   We analyzed data on the expressions of phosphorylated AKT1 and MYC and the concentrations of 228 metabolites from 60 human prostate tumor samples and 16 normal tissue samples. The metabolomic data allowed us to study not only the measurement of individual metabolites, which can exhibit a dynamic range, but the enriched phenotypes in terms of ""metabolite sets"" that come from known metabolic pathways. We studied 71 metabolite sets defined by KEGG annotation. We used a modification of linear combination test (LCT) for multiple continuous outcomes to find associations between metabolite sets and oncogenic expressions, after accounting for the correlation between AKT1 and MYC expressions and the correlation between metabolites in a metabolite set. The LCT performance was evaluated using a simulation study.  Results:   Through a comprehensive analytical method, our study linked oncogenomics and metabolomics data from patients to improve our understanding of the interconnected mechanisms underlying prostate cancer. This study showed that dysregulations of AKT1 and MYC significantly alter the metabolic pathways activated by nonglucose nutrient sources and their downstream targets. Our findings highlighted the role of MYC as the leading, but not the only, oncogene in prostate oncogenesis. In our simulation study, the LCT performed better than the known alternative method, gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA).

In this work, we develop a computer aided diagnosis system for automatic grading of PCa in digitized histopathology images using supervised learning methods. Our pipeline comprises extraction of multi-scale features that include glandular, cellular, and image-based features. A number of novel features are proposed based on intra- and inter-nuclei properties; these features are shown to be among the most important ones for classification. We train our classifiers on 333 tissue microarray (TMA) cores that were sampled from 231 radical prostatectomy patients and annotated in detail by six pathologists for different Gleason grades. We also demonstrate the TMA-trained classifier's performance on additional 230 whole-mount slides of 56 patients, independent of the training dataset, by examining the automatic grading on manually marked lesions and randomly sampled 10% of the benign tissue. For the first time, we incorporate a probabilistic approach for supervised learning by multiple experts to account for the inter-observer grading variability. Through cross-validation experiments, the overall grading agreement of the classifier with the pathologists was found to be an unweighted kappa of 0.51, while the overall agreements between each pathologist and the others ranged from 0.45 to 0.62.

Then, the existing evaluation method of PC risk grades is based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging/scoring system. It utilizes the comprehensive risk data of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, Gleason score, and T2 staging score as the evaluation criteria of PC patients. However, these risk data of PC patients not only may belong to different risk grades simultaneously to result in the unreasonable and uncertain evaluation results to some extent, but also may lose useful fuzzy and uncertain information in the existing evaluation method with non-fuzzy information. To overcome these insufficiencies, the research problems in this study are: (a) to present a new concept of a cubic hesitant fuzzy set (CHFS) for expressing uncertain and hesitant fuzzy information; (b) to propose the generalized distance and similarity measure between CHFSs; (c) to establish a comprehensive evaluation method of PC risk grades with CHFS information by using the similarity measure of CHFSs; and (d) to provide the evaluation examples of PC patients as actual clinical cases for indicating the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed risk evaluation method. Then, the main contribution of this original study is that we present a new concept of CHFS to express uncertain and hesitant information of PC risk grades and the generalized distance-based similarity measure of CHFSs to establish a comprehensive evaluation method of PC risk grades.

Of 4864 patients from multiple institutions for whom NGS was ordered by physicians, only 67 (1.4%) had prostate cancer, representing 1/10 the ordering rate for lung cancer. Prostate cancers harbored 148 unique alterations affecting 63 distinct genes. No two patients had an identical molecular portfolio. The median number of characterized genomic alterations per patient was 3 (range, 1 to 9). Fifty-six of 67 patients (84%) had ≥ 1 potentially actionable alteration.

Patients and methods:   Expression levels of microRNA-373-3p and AKT1 in PCa tissues and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPN) tissues were detected by quantitative Real-Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). According to the follow-up data, survival curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to investigate whether microRNA-373-3p could be served as a biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis of PCa. The effect of microRNA-373-3p on cell proliferation was examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Subsequently, we explored the direct binding condition of AKT1 and microRNA-373-3p by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and Western blot.  Results:   QRT-PCR results showed that microRNA-373-3p level was significantly lower in PCa tissues compared with that of BPN tissues, whereas AKT1 expression was significantly increased. By analyzing the survival curve and ROC curve, we found that the overall survival (OS) of PCa patients with higher microRNA-373-3p expression was markedly longer than those with lower expression. Besides, microRNA-373-3p could be used as an early diagnostic marker to distinguish PCa from BPH. Overexpression of microRNA-373-3p in PCa cells (LNCaP and PC3 cells) remarkably inhibited cell proliferation. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and Western blot showed that microRNA-373-3p targeted the 3'UTR of AKT1 and inhibited its expression.

Methods:   We identified adults enrolled at Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were prevalent statin medication users, newly diagnosed with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer between 2000 and 2012. Statin adherence was measured using the proportion of days covered (PDC) during the 2-year pre-cancer diagnosis and the 2-year post-cancer diagnosis. Adherence patterns were assessed using generalized estimating equations, for all cancers combined and stratified by cancer type and race/ethnicity, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and tumor characteristics.  Results:   Among 10,177 cancer patients, statin adherence decreased from pre- to post-cancer diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj):0.91, 95% confidence interval (95% CI):0.88-0.94). Statin adherence decreased from pre- to post-cancer diagnosis among breast (ORadj:0.94, 95% CI:0.90-0.99) and colorectal (ORadj:0.79, 95% CI:0.74-0.85) cancer patients. No difference in adherence was observed among prostate cancer patients (ORadj:1.01, 95% CI:0.97-1.05). Prior to cancer diagnosis, adherence to statins was generally higher among non-Hispanic whites and multi-race patients than other groups. However, statin adherence after diagnosis decreased only among these two populations (ORadj:0.85, 95% CI:0.85-0.92 and ORadj:0.86, 95% CI:0.76-0.97), respectively.  Conclusions:   We found substantial variation in statin medication adherence following diagnosis by cancer type and race/ethnicity among a large cohort of prevalent statin users in an integrated health care setting.

Insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) are major targets of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) tyrosine kinase activated by IGFs, and are known to play important roles in the activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as the Erk1/2 pathway. Dysregulation of IGF signaling represents a central tumor promoting principle in human carcinogenesis. Prostate carcinoma is highly dependent on the IGF/IGF-IR/IRS axis. Here we identified the deubiquitinase, ubiquitin specific peptidase 9X (USP9X) as a novel binding partner of IRS-2. In a human prostate carcinoma cell line, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of USP9X reduced IGF-IR as well as IRS-2 protein levels and increased their ubiquitination. Knockdown of USP9X suppressed basal activation of the Erk1/2 pathway, which was significantly restored by exogenous expression of IRS-2 but not by IGF-IR, suggesting that the stabilization of IRS-2 by USP9X is critical for basal Erk1/2 activation. Finally, we measured anchorage-independent cell growth, a characteristic cancer feature, by soft-agar colony formation assay. Knockdown of USP9X significantly reduced anchorage-independent cell growth of prostate carcinoma cell line.

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated the octogenarian patients who recieved biopsy for prostatic carcinoma and underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy from 2007 to 2016. We collected the data of clinical variables, perioperative parameters and postoperative pathological results for the octogenarian patients. We recorded and analyzed the recovery of urinary continence of the patients 3 months, 6 months and 1 year after surgery. Biochemical progression was defined as postoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) greater than 2 μg/L for 2 times. We evaluated the non-biochemical recurrence survival rate and overall survival rate by Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis for the patients aged 80 years or older. Multivariable COX regression analyses were used for evaluating the influence factors of biochemical recurrence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.  Results:   For all the 51 patients, the average age was (81.6±1.6) years,and prebiopsy PSA was (15.19±13.68) μg/L. There were 14 cases (27.5%), 19 cases (37.3%) and 18 cases (35.3%) for biopsy Gleason score 6, 7 and ≥8. There were 6 patients (11.8%) with clinical stage T1, 31 patients (60.8%) with clinical stage T2 and 14 patients (27.5%) with clinical stage T3. According to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, grade I was in 6 patients and grade II in 45 patients. All the octogenarian patients received extra-peritoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The average operation time was (189.6±69.1) min, the estimated blood volume was (169.9±163.5) mL, and 11 patients (21.6%) had perioperative complications. There were 29 cases (56.9%) and 22 cases (43.1%) staged for pT2 and pT3 based on postoperative pathological test. Of the pT3 patients, 18 (35.3%) and 4 (7.8%) were pT3a and pT3b. Eight cases (15.7%) presented Gleason score 6,21 cases (41.1%) 7 and 22 cases(43.1%) ≥8. Fourteen cases were positive surgical margin patients after surgery. Overall, the median follow up was 42 months. The continence rate of the octogenarian patients was 64.7%, 82.4% and 92.2% for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the surgery. Twelve cases (23.5%) had biochemical recurrence and 4 cases (7.8%) died in the follow up. There was 1 patient who died of prostate cancer progression and 3 died for other reasons. PSA (P=0.019), pT≥T3 (P=0.017) and positive surgical margin (P=0.020) were independent risk factors for biochemical recurrence of the octogenarian prostate cancer patients according to multivariable COX regression analysis.  Conclusion:   For well selected octogenarian prostate cancer patients, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was a feasible treatment option.

A population-based case-control study has been conducted from January 2015 to December 2016 in a single institution of the municipality of Catania, southern Italy. A total of 118 PCa and 238 population-based controls were collected. Controls had significantly higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, which was evident for several subgroups (including age groups, overweight and obese men, current smokers, alcohol intake, low and medium physical activity levels). PCa cases were found to consume lower amount of vegetables (223 g/d vs. 261 g/d; p = 0.001), legumes (34.26 g/d vs. 53.55 g/d; p = 0.003), and fish (47.75 g/d vs. 58.3 g/d) than controls; other differences emerged were related to alcohol intake (12.37 g/d vs 5.07 g/d; p < 0.01), cereals (254.06 g/d vs.235.94 g/d; p < 0.001), dairy (196 g/d vs. 166 g/d; p < 0.001), and meat consumption (98.09 g/d vs. 70.15 g/d; p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant differences between cases and controls were found regarding fruit, legumes, and olive oil consumption. The Mediterranean diet score was inversely associated with lower likelihood of having PCa in a linear manner (odds ratio [OR]: 0.86 [95% CI 0.77-0.96]). Specifically, individuals in the highest group of adherence had 78% less likelihood of have PCa and 14% less likelihood for each point increase of the score. The model adjusted for total polyphenol intake showed still a significant inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and PCa, but the relation was no more linear and not significant for one-point increase of the score (OR: 0.88 [95% CI 0.77-1.01]).

Experimental design:   We developed and validated a conjugate of the STAT3 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) tethered to immunostimulatory TLR9 agonist (CpG oligonucleotide) to improve targeting of human and mouse prostate cancer and myeloid immune cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC).  Results:   CpG-STAT3ASO conjugates showed improved biodistribution and potency of STAT3 knockdown in target cells in vitro and in vivo. Systemic administration of CpG-STAT3ASO (5 mg/kg) eradicated bone-localized, Ras/Myc-driven, and Ptenpc -/- Smad4pc -/- Trp53c -/- prostate tumors in the majority of treated mice.

Both innate and adaptive immunity contributed to systemic antitumor responses as verified by the depletion of Gr1+ myeloid cells and CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively. Importantly, only the bifunctional CpG-STAT3ASO, but not control CpG oligonucleotides, STAT3ASO alone, or the coinjection of both oligonucleotides, succeeded in recruiting neutrophils and CD8+ T cells into tumors. Thus, the concurrence of TLR9 activation with STAT3 inhibition in the same cellular compartment is indispensable for overcoming tumor immune tolerance and effective antitumor immunity against prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   The bifunctional, immunostimulatory, and tolerance-breaking design of CpG-STAT3ASO offers a blueprint for the development of effective and safer oligonucleotide strategies for treatment of immunologically ""cold"" human cancers.""","""['Dayson Moreira', 'Tomasz Adamus', 'Xingli Zhao', 'Yu-Lin Su', 'Zhuoran Zhang', 'Seok Voon White', 'Piotr Swiderski', 'Xin Lu', 'Ronald A DePinho', 'Sumanta K Pal', 'Marcin Kortylewski']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Myeloid cells as a target for oligonucleotide therapeutics: turning obstacles into opportunities.', 'B Cell Lymphoma Immunotherapy Using TLR9-Targeted Oligonucleotide STAT3 Inhibitors.', 'Leukemia cell-targeted STAT3 silencing and TLR9 triggering generate systemic antitumor immunity.', 'TLR9-Targeted STAT3 Silencing Abrogates Immunosuppressive Activity of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells from Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'STAT3 in Tumor-Associated Myeloid Cells: Multitasking to Disrupt Immunity.', 'Targeted TLR9 Agonist Elicits Effective Antitumor Immunity against Spontaneously Arising Breast Tumors.', 'Evolving cognition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway: autoimmune disorders and cancer.', 'In Vivo Models for Prostate Cancer Research.', 'Engineered adult stem cells: a promising tool for anti-cancer therapy.', ""STAT3 and Its Pathways' Dysregulation-Underestimated Role in Urological Tumors.""]"""

Given the connection between prostate and urethra, we hypothesized that semen ejaculate would be an ideal specimen for detection of CaP specific biomarkers, such as AMACR. This study explores the detection of semen AMACR protein in men with and without CaP.  Methods:   Semen ejaculates from 28 biopsy proven CaP patients prior to radical prostatectomy and 15 age-comparable controls were analyzed. An indirect sandwich ELISA chemiluminescence assay was used to detect semen AMACR, PSA, and Matriptase proteins. Tissue AMACR protein was quantified in 12 corresponding prostatectomy specimens using automated quantitative analysis (AQUA).  Results:   Semen AMACR protein was detected in 23 of 28 (82%) CaP patients and 23 of 24 (96%) CaP patients with significant tumor volume (>0.5 cc or 0.3 g). Among the 5 cancer patients with undetectable semen AMACR, 4 patients had small tumor volumes (<1% or 0.3 g). Semen AMACR protein was also detected in 7 of 15 (47%) control noncancer patients. Using 76 ng/ml as a cutoff value, 20 of 28 (71%) patients and 20 of 24 (83%) patients with significant tumor volume were positive for semen AMACR protein, whereas only 5 of 15 (33%) age-comparable controls were positive. AMACR levels degrade with time.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to demonstrate that AMACR protein is detectable in semen ejaculate. The higher AMACR levels detected in cancer patients suggests that semen AMACR protein may be useful as a noninvasive test for prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2014), we identified 539 patients with nonsurgically treated primary mUTUC. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted Kaplan-Meier plots, as well as multivariable Cox regression models relying on IPTW and landmark analyses, were used to test the effect of CHT versus no CHT on overall mortality and cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   Of 539 patients with metastatic UTUC, 277 (51.4%) underwent CHT. In nonadjusted and IPTW-adjusted Kaplan-Meier plots, CHT was associated with better overall survival (9 vs. 2 months; P < .001 in both analyses). In multivariable Cox regression models, CHT administration independently predicted lower overall mortality before IPTW (hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.39; P < .001), as well as after IPTW adjustment (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.25-0.38; P < .001).

We conducted a retrospective study to explore disease characteristics and treatment outcomes of men with metastatic prostate cancer harboring germline and/or somatic MMR mutations detected using clinical-grade genomic assays. Thirteen patients with a deleterious MMR gene mutation were identified. Median age was 64 yr, 75% had grade group 5 (Gleason sum 9 or 10), 23% had intraductal histology, 46% had metastatic disease at initial diagnosis, and 31% had visceral metastases. Most patients (46%) had MSH6 mutations, 73% demonstrated microsatellite instability, and median tumor mutational load was 18/Mb (range, 3-165 mutations/Mb). Surprisingly, responses to standard hormonal therapies were very durable (median progression-free survival [PFS] of 67 mo to initial androgen deprivation and median PFS of 26 mo to abiraterone/enzalutamide). Two of four men receiving PD-1 inhibitors achieved a ≥50% prostate-specific antigen response at 12 wk, with a median PFS duration in these four men of 9 mo. Despite aggressive clinical and pathological features, patients with MMR-mutated advanced prostate cancer appear to have particular sensitivity to hormonal therapies, as well as anecdotal responses to PD-1 inhibitors. Certain histological features (grade group 5, intraductal carcinoma) should prompt evaluation for MMR deficiency. These data are only hypothesis generating.

The current trend observed in various European and American studies is a decrease in the number of radical prostatectomy (RP) in low-risk PCa and an increase for intermediate or locally advanced diseases. The objective of this study was to observe the migration of the pathological stages from radical prostatectomy (RP) over 10 years in France through 2 French centers.  Methods:   It was a multicentric retrospective study, where all the RP realized in 2 French tertiary centers, in a laparoscopic or retropubic approach for each of the years 2005, 2010 and 2015 were included. Preoperative data (age, PSA, clinical stage, number of positive biopsies, Gleason biopsy score) and postoperative data (pTNM, pathological Gleason score (pGS)) were analyzed and compared.  Results:   In all, 1282 RP were realized (503 in 2005, 403 in 2010, 376 in 2015). Respectively between 2005, 2010, 2015 the average number of positive biopsy increased significantly from 2.30 vs. 2.88 vs. 5.3 (P=0.0001). The distribution of D'Amico's risk evolves with time: low-risk: 49.9 vs. 44.4 vs. 15.7% (P=0.0001); intermediate risk: 40.95 vs. 43.92 vs. 64.1% (P=0.0001) and high-risk: 9.15 vs. 11.66 vs. 20.2% (P=0.0001) between 2005, 2010 and 2015 respectively. pGS evolved to higher score with SG<7: 22.8 vs. 29.9 vs. 7.1% et SG≥7: 77.2 vs. 70.1 vs. 92.9% (P=0.001). Also, pTNM increased to non-organ-confined disease: pT2: 66.9 vs. 51.9 vs. 48.7%; pT3: 33.1 vs. 48.1 vs. 51.3% (P=0.0001).  Conclusion:   This study showed a change in the management of PCa since new recommendations from medical authorities about PSA screening and evolving of conservative treatment. Number of RP increase for higher risk PCa. This change corresponds to better patient selection for RP: decrease for low-risk and increase for high-risk organ-confined disease.

Methods:   Interfractional CTV shape variations were estimated from weekly cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images using statistical point distribution models. The interfractional CTV shape variation was taken into account in the van Herk's margin formula. The PTV margins without and with the CTV shape variation, i.e., standard (PTVori) and new (PTVshape) margins, were applied to 10 clinical cases that had weekly CBCT images acquired during their treatment sessions. Each patient was replanned for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk CTVs, using both margins. The dose indices (D98 and V70) of treatment plans with the two margins were compared on weekly pseudo-planning computed tomography (PCT) images, which were defined as PCT images registered using a deformable image registration technique with weekly CBCT images, including contours of the CTV, rectum, and bladder.  Results:   The percentage of treatment fractions of patients who received CTV D98 greater than 95% of a prescribed dose increased from 80.3 (PTVori) to 81.8% (PTVshape) for low-risk CTVs, 78.8 (PTVori) to 87.9% (PTVshape) for intermediate-risk CTVs, and 80.3 (PTVori) to 87.9% (PTVshape) for high-risk CTVs.

Methods:   An Alderson phantom was irradiated using four VMAT treatment plans (one prostate, two head-and-neck and one lung case) in which delivery, thickness and setup errors were introduced. EPID measurements were performed to reconstruct 3D dose distributions of ""error"" plans, which were compared with ""no-error"" plans using the mean gamma (γmean), near-maximum gamma (γ1%) and the difference in isocenter dose (ΔDisoc) as metrics.  Results:   Out of a total of 42 serious errors, the number of errors detected was 33 (79%), and 27 out of 30 (90%) if setup errors are not included. The system was able to pick up errors of 5 mm movement of a leaf bank, a wrong collimator rotation angle and a wrong photon beam energy. A change in phantom thickness of 1 cm was detected for all cases, while only for the head-and-neck plans a 2 cm horizontal and vertical shift of the phantom were alerted. A single leaf error of 5 mm could be detected for the lung plan only.  Conclusion:   Although performed for a limited number of cases and error types, this study shows that EPID-based 3D transit dosimetry is able to detect a number of serious errors in dose delivery, leaf bank position and patient thickness during VMAT delivery.

Materials and methods:   Twelve clinicians interpreted 210 myocardial computed tomography (CT) perfusion (CTP) examinations, and nine clinicians interpreted 165 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) prostate images. In three separate sessions, each participant read the same image set using greyscale, hot-iron, and rainbow scales, respectively. Participants scored their level of confidence for tumour presence in the ADC study, and for ischaemia in the CTP study, from 0 to 100. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used as the performance metric. For cases that scored >50, CTP readers' agreement on the ischaemic transmural extent was analysed, and ADC map readers' selected values and coordinates for the lowest ADC within the detected tumour were compared across different colour scales.  Results:   For CTP detection, the AUC was up to 0.10 higher with greyscale, 0.67±0.02 (standard error), compared to rainbow, 0.56±0.02, and detection with hot-iron was in between (0.61±0.03). For ischaemic transmural lesion categorisation, observed inter-reader agreement was highest with greyscale for category 25-50%. There is a small tendency for rainbow and greyscale to outperform hot-iron in the detection of prostate tumours.

In these workflows, intraprostatic gold fiducial markers (GFM) show similar signal behavior as calcifications and bleeding in T2-weighted MRI-images. Accurate GFM identification in MRI-only radiotherapy workflows is therefore a major challenge. C-arm X-ray images (CkV-images), acquired at GFM implantation, could provide GFM position information and be used to confirm correct identification in T2-weighted MRI-images. This would require negligible GFM migration between implantation and MRI-imaging. Marker migration was therefore investigated. The aim of this study was to show the feasibility of using CkV-images to confirm GFM identification in an MRI-only prostate radiotherapy workflow. An anterior-posterior digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR)-image and a mirrored posterior-anterior CkV-image were acquired two weeks apart for 16 patients in an MRI-only radiotherapy workflow. The DRR-image originated from synthetic CT-images (created from MRI-images). A common image geometry was defined between the DRR- and CkV-image for each patient. A rigid registration between the GFM center of mass (CoM) coordinates was performed and the distance between each of the GFM in the DRR- and registered CkV-image was calculated. The same methodology was used to assess GFM migration for 31 patients in a CT-based radiotherapy workflow. The distance calculated was considered a measure of GFM migration. A statistical test was performed to assess any difference between the cohorts. The mean absolute distance difference for the GFM CoM between the DRR- and CkV-image in the MRI-only cohort was 1.7 ± 1.4 mm. The mean GFM migration was 1.2 ± 0.7 mm. No significant difference between the measured total distances of the two cohorts could be detected (P = 0.37). This demonstrated that, a C-Arm X-ray image acquired from the GFM implantation procedure could be used to confirm GFM identification from MRI-images.

This investigation aimed to evaluate the effect of high concentrations of fatty acids and/or glucose in tumour prostate cells, focusing on the proliferation/migration profile and oxidative stress. PC3 cells were treated with high concentration of saturated fatty acid (palmitate, 100 µM), glucose (220 mg/dL), or both for 24 or 48 h. Results demonstrated that PC3 cells showed a significant increase in proliferation after 48 h of treatment with glucose and palmitate+glucose. Cell proliferation was associated with reduced levels of AMPK phosphorylation in glucose group at 24 and 48 h of treatment, while palmitate group presented this result only after 48 h of treatment. Also, there was a significant increase in cell migration between time 0 and 48 h after all treatments, except in the control. Catalase activity was increased by palmitate in the beginning of treatment, while glucose presented a later effect. Also, nitrite production was increased by glucose only after 48 h, and the total antioxidant activity was enhanced by palmitate in the initial hours.

Transparent communication accessibility is needed between deaf male ASL users and their physicians to maximize the benefit to risk ratio of using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a screening tool for early detection. The objective is to compare shared decision-making outcomes between deaf and hearing males who are (1) age-eligible for PSA screening and (2) younger than 45 years old with a family history of cancer. An accessible health survey including questions about PSA test, PCC, modes of communication, and cancer history was administered in ASL to a nationwide sample of deaf adults from February 2017 to April 2018. Two subsamples were created: (1) 45- to 69-year-old men who were age-eligible for PSA testing and (2) 18- to 44-year-old men with a family history of cancer. Age-eligible and younger deaf men with a family history of cancer are at disparity for shared decision making compared to their hearing peers. Regardless of age and PSA testing status, deaf men felt significantly less engaged in shared decision making with their health care providers compared to hearing men. Participation in shared decision making requires not only accessible communication but also cultural competency in working with deaf patients.

The β-catenin:TCF interaction plays a critical role in the Wnt signaling pathway which is over-activated in multiple cancers, including prostate cancer. Using the Rosetta suite of protein design algorithms, we evaluate how different macrocycle structures can bind a pocket on β-catenin that associates with TCF. The in silico designed macrocycles are screened in vitro using luciferase reporters to identify promising compounds.

Methods:   The case-control portion of the study was conducted in nine UK centers with men ages 50-69 years who underwent prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer within the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial. Two data sources were used to appraise causality: a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of metabolites in 24,925 participants and a GWAS of prostate cancer in 44,825 cases and 27,904 controls within the Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium.  Results:   Thirty-five metabolites were strongly associated with prostate cancer (P < 0.0014, multiple-testing threshold). These fell into four classes: (i) lipids and lipoprotein subclass characteristics (total cholesterol and ratios, cholesterol esters and ratios, free cholesterol and ratios, phospholipids and ratios, and triglyceride ratios); (ii) fatty acids and ratios; (iii) amino acids; (iv) and fluid balance. Fourteen top metabolites were proxied by genetic variables, but MR indicated these were not causal.  Conclusions:   We identified 35 circulating metabolites associated with prostate cancer presence, but found no evidence of causality for those 14 testable with MR. Thus, the 14 MR-tested metabolites are unlikely to be mechanistically important in prostate cancer risk.

As some states elected to expand Medicaid and others did not, the goal of this study was to determine the effect of Medicaid expansion on the insurance status at cancer diagnosis of brachytherapy patients.  Methods and materials:   Patients aged 19-64 years with breast, cervical, uterine, or prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy from 2011 to 2014 with known insurance status were identified within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. Fisher's exact test was used to test for associations of insurance status with expanded versus nonexpanded states. For multivariate analysis, a binomial logistic regression was performed, dichotomized to uninsured versus any insurance.  Results:   Fifteen thousand four hundred ninety-seven subjects met entry criteria. In the entire cohort, rates of uninsurance were higher in nonexpanded states at baseline (4.5% vs. 2.9%, p < 0.00001). With selective Medicaid expansion in 2014, expanded states had a reduction in uninsurance rates (2.9-1.8%, p = 0.026), whereas nonexpanded states had a nonsignificant increase in uninsurance (4.5-5.0%, p = 0.371). There was a reduction in uninsurance in expanded states in areas of highest poverty (2.9-1.1%, p = 0.0004) not seen in nonexpanded states. These associations remained significant on multivariate analysis (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.8-2.8, p < 0.00001).  Conclusions:   Patients who received brachytherapy were less likely to be uninsured in states where Medicaid was expanded, particularly evident in regions with highest poverty levels.

Prior studies are retrospective and based on incomplete responses (<50%) to questionnaires, with small sample sizes for any particular surgery. The ORIOLES initiative was a prospective cohort study (2017-2018) designed to measure postdischarge opioid prescribing and use and clinical predictors of use for consecutive patients after radical prostatectomy. The objectives were to establish a postdischarge opioid reference value to meet the needs of >80% of patients and compare open and robotic surgery. A total of 205 adult patients were enrolled, with 100% completing follow-up. In units of oral morphine equivalents (OMEQ), a median of 225mg was prescribed and 22.5mg used. There was no difference by surgical approach or among patients with a history of pain-related diagnoses. Overall, 77% of postdischarge opioid medication was unused, with 84% of patients requiring ≤112.5mg OMEQ. Only 9% of patients appropriately disposed of leftover medication. Approximately 5% reported continued incisional pain due to surgery at 30d, but none required continued opioid medication use. Prescribing more opioids was independently associated with greater opioid use in adjusted models.

However, side effects of ADT often lead to reduced quality of life and physical function. Existing evidence demonstrates that exercise can ameliorate multiple treatment-related side effects for men on ADT, yet adherence rates are often low. The method of exercise delivery (e.g., supervised group in-centre vs. individual home-based) may be important from clinical and economic perspectives; however, few studies have compared different delivery models. Additionally, long-term exercise adherence and an understanding of predictors of adherence are critical to achieving sustained benefits, but such data are lacking. The primary aim of this multi-centre phase III non-inferiority randomized controlled trial is to determine whether a home-based delivery model is non-inferior to a group-based delivery model in terms of benefits in fatigue and fitness in this population. Two other key aims include examining cost-effectiveness and long-term adherence.  Methods:   Men diagnosed with prostate cancer of any stage, starting or continuing on ADT for at least 6 months, fluent in English, and living close to a study centre are eligible. Participants complete five assessments over 12 months (baseline and every 3 months during the 6-month intervention and 6-month follow-up phases), including a fitness assessment and self-report questionnaires. Biological outcomes are collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months. A total of 200 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to supervised group training or home-based training supported by smartphones, health coaches, and Fitbit technology. Participants are asked to complete 4 to 5 exercise sessions per week, incorporating aerobic, resistance and flexibility training. Outcomes include fatigue, quality of life, fitness measures, body composition, biological outcomes, and program adherence. Cost information will be obtained using patient diary-based self-report and utilities via the EQ-5D.  Discussion:   To disseminate publicly funded exercise programs widely, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness have to be demonstrated. The goals of this trial are to provide these data along with an increased understanding of adherence to exercise among men with prostate cancer receiving ADT.

The consultations followed a patient-centered approach with the aim to provide guidance and evidence-based information. Sociodemographic, disease-related data as well as information about the consultations' content were collected in a standardized manner, and feedback questionnaires were sent out immediately after the consultations.  Results:   Overall, 5269 callers from all over Germany used the service (57% patients, 43% relatives). The ""big 4"" cancer types (breast, gastrointestinal, prostate, and lung) accounted for 55% of all calls. In 67% of calls, patients had just received the diagnosis or commenced anticancer therapy; 69% of patients had advanced or metastatic diseases. More than half of the callers (55%) had vague concerns like ""what else can I do?"" rather than specific questions related to CAM. The consultations covered a broad spectrum of issues from CAM therapies to cancer treatment and measures supportive of health, nutrition, and psychosocial support. Callers highly valued the service.  Conclusions:   Consulting about CAM addresses important unmet needs from cancer patients and their relatives. It provides clinicians with the opportunity to engage in open and supportive dialogues about evidence-based CAM to help with symptom management, psychological support, and individual self-care.

The Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) recommendations propose standardised reporting mpMRI data for these men. This includes accurate size measurements of lesions over time, but such approach is time consuming for the radiologist and there is a strong need of dedicated tools to report serial scans in a systematic manner. We present the results from an initial validation cohort using dedicated PRECISE reporting software to allow automated comparison between sequential scans on AS.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analysed baseline and follow-up scans of 20 men randomised to 6 months of daily dutasteride (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) from the MAPPED trial. Men underwent 3T mpMRI at baseline and after 6 months, and a dedicated radiologist reported the scans using both a widespread commercially-available platform (Osirix®) and a semi-automated dedicated PRECISE reporting tool (MIM®). Tumour volume by planimetry in all sequences and conspicuity on diffusion-weighted imaging were assessed. Reporting time was recorded, and we used the Wilcoxon test for statistical analysis.  Results:   Median tumour volumes and conspicuity were similar using both approaches. The reporting time of the follow-up scan was quicker using the PRECISE reporting workflow both in the whole population (12'33″ vs 10'52″; p = 0.005) and in the dutasteride arm (15'50″ vs 12'59″; p = 0.01). A structured report including clinical and imaging data was generated according to the PRECISE recommendations and a comparison table between lesion characteristics at baseline and follow-up scans was also included.  Conclusion:   We conclude that a dedicated PRECISE reporting tool for sequential scans in men on AS results in a significant reduction in the reporting time and allows the radiologist to easily compare scans over time.

However, few studies have examined the association between physical activity and sitting time with cancer incidence within the same population.  Methods:   We followed 38,154 healthy Norwegian adults in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) for cancer incidence from 1995-97 to 2014. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate risk of site-specific and total cancer incidence by baseline sitting time and physical activity.  Results:   During the 16-years follow-up, 4,196 (11%) persons were diagnosed with cancer. We found no evidence that people who had prolonged sitting per day or had low levels of physical activity had an increased risk of total cancer incidence, compared to those who had low sitting time and were physically active. In the multivariate model, sitting ≥8 h/day was associated with 22% (95% CI, 1.05-1.42) higher risk of prostate cancer compared to sitting <8 h/day. Further, men with low physical activity (≤8.3 MET-h/week) had 31% (95% CI, 1.00-1.70) increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and 45% (95% CI, 1.01-2.09) increased risk of lung cancer compared to participants with a high physical activity (>16.6 MET-h/week). The joint effects of physical activity and sitting time the indicated that prolonged sitting time increased the risk of CRC independent of physical activity in men.

Clinical experience shows that prostate cancer occurs predominantly in the peripheral zone (PZ) and there exist different evaluation criteria for different regions in the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS).  Purpose:   To develop a fully automatic approach to segmenting the prostate outer contour and the PZ contour with high efficacy.  Population:   In all, 163 subjects, including 61 healthy subjects and 102 prostate cancer patients. For each subject, all slices that contained prostate gland in diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) and T2 -weighted images (T2 WIs) were selected as the datasets.  Field strength:   T2 -weighted, DWI at 3.0T.  Assessment:   The computer-generated segmentation results were compared with the manual outlining results that were depicted by two experts with more than 5 years' experience. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), false-positive rate (FPR), and false-negative rate (FNR) were used to compared the algorithm and manual segmentation results.  Statistical tests:   A paired t-test was adopted for comparison between our method and classical U-Net segmentation methods.  Results:   The mean DSC was 92.7 ± 4.2% for the total whole prostate gland and 79.3 ± 10.4% for the total peripheral zone. Compared with classical U-Net segmentation methods, our segmentation precision was significantly higher (P < 0.001).  Data conclusion:   By cropping the region of interest and cascading the two networks, our method balances the positive and negative sample gradually, and results in higher segmentation accuracy. This fully automatic strategy could provide satisfactory performance in prostate DWIs and T2 WIs-based image segmentation.  Level of evidence:   2 Technical Efficacy Stage 1 J. Magn. Reson.

However, because of attenuation of the radiofrequency (RF) fields at 7T, it is not certain if this SNR gain can be realized for prostate imaging.  Purpose/hypothesis:   To investigate the SNR gain in prostate imaging at 7T as compared with 3T. It is expected that SNR will improve for prostate imaging at 7T compared with 3T.  Study type:   Prospective.  Subjects:   Four healthy volunteers and one prostate cancer patient.  Field strength/sequence:   All subjects were scanned at 3T and at 7T using optimal coil setups for both field strengths. For all volunteers, proton density-weighted images were acquired for SNR analysis and actual flip angle imaging (AFI) B1+| maps were acquired for correction of measured SNR values. In the patient, a T2 -weighted (T2 w) image was acquired at 3T and at 7T.  Assessment:   SNR was calculated in the prostate region for all volunteers. SNR was normalized for flip angle, receiver bandwidth, and voxel volume. SNR was also calculated for different sensitivity encoding (SENSE) acceleration factors.  Statistical testing:   SNR values are represented as the arithmetic mean of SNR values in the prostate. Estimated SNR in the T2 w image is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the signal intensity (SI) divided by the standard deviation of the SI in a specified zone. Tumor-to-tissue contrast is calculated as (SItumor +SIzone )/( SItumor -SIzone ).  Results:   An increase in SNR ranging from 1.7-fold to 2.8-fold was measured in the prostate at 7T in comparison to 3T for four volunteers. At 7T, it is possible to achieve a 4-fold SENSE acceleration in the left-right direction with similar SNR to a nonaccelerated 3T image. T2 w imaging was done at 3T and 7T in one patient, where improved tumor-to-tissue contrast was demonstrated at 7T.  Data conclusion:   SNR improves for prostate imaging at 7T as compared with 3T.

The prepared NLCs were imaged with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Particle size and zeta potential and FLV entrapment efficiency (%EE) were measured, and the FLV release profile was constructed.

The prepared NLCs were spherical, with a size of 85.2 ± 4.1 nm, and had a zeta potential of - 25.1 ± 3.4 mV and a %EE of 98.2 ± 1.1%. FLV IC50 was decreased by half by the formula and by about 30% when compared with the three drugs together. According to cell-cycle analysis, treatment with FLV-ALA-EA NLCs caused a significant increase in pre-G1 phase by about 1.44-fold in comparison with FLV-ALA-EA.

Thus, we compared postoperative prostate-specific antigen levels at the first follow-up with the expected levels while considering the half-life of prostate-specific antigen to improve the prediction of biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy in patients with adverse pathologic features.  Methods:   Patients treated with robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy were enrolled. Patients with a follow-up duration of < 12 months or positive lymphadenectomy results were excluded. ""Adverse prostate-specific antigen"" was defined as a prostate-specific antigen level higher than the expected level at 6 weeks.  Results:   Among 450 patients, adverse pathologic features and adverse prostate-specific antigen were found in 260 (57.8%) and 245 (54.5%) patients, respectively. Analysis of patients with and without abnormal prostate-specific antigen level revealed significantly different biochemical failure-free survival outcomes. Patients with one adverse pathologic feature but without adverse prostate-specific antigen showed similar biochemical failure-free survival to those without adverse pathologic features. Adverse prostate-specific antigen was identified as an independent predictor for biochemical failure within 1 year after radical prostatectomy. The area under the curve when adding adverse prostate-specific antigen to the conventional factors was significantly higher than that for the conventional factors alone.

Results:   Of 738 patients, 402 were included in the propensity-score matching analysis, and they were equally distributed among groups. The overall iPCa detection rates were similar in both groups (9.9% vs. 8.5%; p = 0.73), and there were no statistically significant differences in terms of tumour stage, Gleason score or the rate of clinically significant iPCa, although the number of cassettes analysed was significantly higher in the morcellation group than in the OSP group.

Beyond the tumor suppressor TP53, the POLR2A gene encoding the catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) is also included in a ~20-megabase deletion region of 17p in 63% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Using a focused CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we discovered that heterozygous loss of 17p confers a selective dependence of CRPC cells on the ubiquitin E3 ligase Ring-Box 1 (RBX1). RBX1 activates POLR2A by the K63-linked ubiquitination and thus elevates the RNAP2-mediated mRNA synthesis. Combined inhibition of RNAP2 and RBX1 profoundly suppress the growth of CRPC in a synergistic manner, which potentiates the therapeutic effectivity of the RNAP2 inhibitor, α-amanitin-based antibody drug conjugate (ADC).

TNFα promotes the activity of NFκB, which regulates a number of anti-apoptotic and proinflammatory genes, including those encoding the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs); however, in the presence of IAP antagonists, TNFα can induce cell death. In the presence of recombinant or macrophage-derived TNFα, we found that IAP antagonists triggered degradation of cIAP1 and induced formation of Complex-IIb, consisting of caspase-8, FADD and RIPK1 in CRPC models; however, no, or modest levels of apoptosis were induced. This resistance was found to be mediated by both the long (L) and short (S) splice forms of the caspase-8 inhibitor, FLIP, another NFκB-regulated protein frequently overexpressed in CRPC. By decreasing FLIP expression at the post-transcriptional level in PC3 and DU145 cells (but not VCaP), the Class-I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Entinostat promoted IAP antagonist-induced cell death in these models in a manner dependent on RIPK1, FADD and Caspase-8. Of note, Entinostat primarily targeted the nuclear rather than cytoplasmic pool of FLIP(L). While the cytoplasmic pool of FLIP(L) was highly stable, the nuclear pool was more labile and regulated by the Class-I HDAC target Ku70, which we have previously shown regulates FLIP stability.

It is yet unclear whether invasive cribriform and intraductal carcinoma of the prostate both have independent prognostic value, or whether field size of invasive cribriform carcinoma has impact on disease outcome. Our objective was to determine the prognostic impact of intraductal and invasive cribriform prostate cancer histological subtypes in radical prostatectomies. We reviewed 420 prostatectomy specimens with ISUP grade 2 prostate cancer, assessed the percentages of Gleason grade 4 and tertiary 5, and performed immunohistochemistry for basal cells to discriminate intraductal from invasive cribriform growth. Small and large invasive cribriform fields were distinguished based on a diameter of at least twice the size of adjacent pre-existent normal glands. Clinicopathological parameters and biochemical recurrence-free survival were used as endpoints. Cribriform architecture was observed in 228 (54.3%) men, 103 (24.5%) of whom had intraductal, 194 (46.2%) small invasive, and 34 (8.1%) large invasive cribriform growth. Large invasive cribriform architecture was associated with older age (P < 0.001), higher percentage Gleason grade 4 (P = 0.001), extraprostatic expansion (P < 0.001), and more frequent lymph node metastases (P = 0.002), when compared with small invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma. Univariate analysis identified PSA, pT-stage, surgical margin status, and intraductal and invasive cribriform growth as significant predictors for biochemical recurrence-free survival. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, pT-stage (hazard ratio = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.02-2.63, P = 0.04), positive surgical margins (hazard ratio = 3.28, 95% CI: 2.06-5.23, P < 0.001), and large cribriform growth (hazard ratio = 4.36, 95% CI: 2.08-9.17, P < 0.001) were independent predictors for biochemical recurrence-free survival, while intraductal carcinoma, small cribriform growth, and percentage of Gleason grade 4 were not.

Nanotechnology-based imaging is particularly promising for overcoming these limitations because nanosized imaging agents can specifically home in on tumors via the ""enhanced permeation and retention"" (EPR) effect, thus resulting in enhanced imaging sensitivity and specificity. Here, we report an original nanosystem for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging based on an amphiphilic dendrimer, which bears multiple PET reporting units at the terminals. This dendrimer is able to self-assemble into small and uniform nanomicelles, which accumulate in tumors for effective PET imaging. Benefiting from the combined dendrimeric multivalence and EPR-mediated passive tumor targeting, this nanosystem demonstrates superior imaging sensitivity and specificity, with up to 14-fold increased PET signal ratios compared with the clinical gold reference 2-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG). Most importantly, this dendrimer system can detect imaging-refractory low-glucose-uptake tumors that are otherwise undetectable using [18F]FDG. In addition, it is endowed with an excellent safety profile and favorable pharmacokinetics for PET imaging.

However, there is limited evidence to support the efficacy or mechanism of action of banana flower against benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In the present study, the anti-BPH activity and mechanisms of banana flower extracts were investigated in vitro and in vivo.  Materials and methods:   The banana flower extract is a water-soluble extract obtained by sonication. MTT assay was used to examine whether banana flower extract exhibited cytotoxic effects on BPH-1 cells. The effect of banana flower extract on cell-cycle distribution was examined by flow cytometry. The expression of cell-cycle-regulatory molecules was determined by western blot analysis. Testosterone propionate (TP)-induced rat model of BPH was used to evaluate the anti-BPH activity of banana flower extract in vivo.  Results:   Banana flower extract reduced epithelial cell line BPH-1 cell viability through cell-cycle arrest at G1 phase. Moreover, banana flower extract reduced the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6, while it increased the expression of p53 and p27. Interestingly, banana flower extract suppressed BPH-related inflammatory responses through suppressing cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 production. Finally, banana flower extract administered orally to male rats reduced prostatic weight and serum dihydrotestosterone level, and improved prostate gland morphology. High-performance liquid chromatography revealed that banana flower extract contains citric acid, taurine, pantothenic acid and nicotinic acid components. In summary, banana flower extract may be used as a therapeutic agent for BPH via anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities.""","""['Liang-Chih Liu', 'Yung-Hsiang Lin', 'Ying-Chao Lin', 'Chi-Tang Ho', 'Chao-Ming Hung', 'Tzong-DER Way', 'DA-Tian Bau']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""In Vivo""","""['Paljung-San, a traditional herbal medicine, attenuates benign prostatic hyperplasia in vitro and in vivo.', 'Evaluation of the therapeutic effect against benign prostatic hyperplasia and the active constituents from Epilobium angustifolium L.', 'Anti-proliferative effects of qianliening capsules on prostatic hyperplasia in vitro and in vivo.', 'Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge flower extract inhibits benign prostatic hyperplasia in rats.', 'Voratins A-C: Pyridinium Alkaloids from the Marine Dinoflagellate Effrenium voratum with Inhibitory Effects on Biomarkers for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Cancer Preventive and Therapeutic Potential of Banana and Its Bioactive Constituents: A Systematic, Comprehensive, and Mechanistic Review.']"""

Almost all of the studied compounds (except 5-HT1A receptor agonist (2R)-(+)-8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT)) exhibited absolute cytotoxic activity against the examined cancer cells. The compound 4-Fluoro-N-[2-[4-(7-methoxy-1-naphthalenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]benzamide hydrochloride (S14506) that showed highest activity against neuroblastoma tumors was the 5-HT1A receptor agonist (although not alike other 5-HT1A receptor agonists). On the other hand, the compound 6-nitro-2-(4-undecylpiperazin-1-yl)quinoline hydrochloride (AZ07) that had the highest activity against PC-3 prostate cancer cells was a compound exhibiting antagonistic activity against the 5-HT1A receptor. Thus, compounds of oncotoxic properties S14506 and AZ07 should be evaluated further for their potential use in the prevention and treatment of cancer. Most of the 15 compounds tested exhibited either agonistic or antagonistic activity for both the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathways in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells that overexpress the 5HT1AR gene. However, compounds paroxetine, N-Ac-paroxetine and 2-[4-(cyclobutylmethyl)piperazin-1-yl]-6-nitroquinoline hydrochloride (AB22) simultaneously exhibited antagonistic activity on the cAMP pathway and agonistic activity on the ERK1/2 pathway. Fluoxetine relative to compound AZ07 had almost three times lower cytotoxic activity against PC-3 prostate cancer cells. However, the proapoptotic activity of fluoxetine compared to compound AZ07 is almost two times higher which would suggest that the cytotoxic activity of both compounds may be dependent on different cell death mechanisms. Compound S14506 was found to be an antagonist of the serine-threonine protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Prosurvival Akt activity may be reversed by Akt antagonists. Therefore, the antagonistic activity of S14506 on the Akt pathway may evoke caspase-3 expression and cytotoxicity. It appears that one should not expect a straightforward relationship between the activation of particular serotonergic pathways by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and 5-HT1A receptor ligands and their cytotoxic or cytoprotective activity. Additionally, nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB), which may be involved in 5-HT-dependent biochemical pathways by coordinating different subunits in the formation of a dimer, may regulate the transcription of different transduction pathways. Therefore, it can be suggested that the mechanism of the cytotoxic activity of certain compounds (serotonergic against nonserotonergic) may depend on the compound and cancer type being examined. Docking studies showed that S14506, buspirone and spiperone bind in similar ways in the 5-HT1A receptor model and interacted with similar 5-HT1A receptor residues. S14506 and spiperone were found to be located closer to both phenylalanines in TM6 than buspirone, thus exhibiting more antagonist binding modes.""","""['Jarosław Walory', 'Lidia Mielczarek', 'Małgorzata Jarończyk', 'Mirosława Koronkiewicz', 'Jerzy Kossakowski', 'Ryszard Bugno', 'Andrzej J Bojarski', 'Zdzisław Chilmonczyk']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Dual actions of 5-MeO-DIPT at the serotonin transporter and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor in the mouse striatum and prefrontal cortex.', 'Mechanism of action of the bimodal antidepressant vilazodone: evidence for serotonin1A-receptor-mediated auto-augmentation of extracellular serotonin output.', 'Novel 4-aryl-pyrido1,2-cpyrimidines with dual SSRI and 5-HT(1A) activity. part 3.', 'Characterization of the potent 5-HT(1A/B) receptor antagonist and serotonin reuptake inhibitor SB-649915: preclinical evidence for hastened onset of antidepressant/anxiolytic efficacy.', 'Serotonin transporter and receptor ligands with antidepressant activity as neuroprotective and proapoptotic agents.', 'The Effect of the Stress Induced by Hydrogen Peroxide and Corticosterone on Tryptophan Metabolism, Using Human Neuroblastoma Cell Line (SH-SY5Y).']"""

Targeted drug delivery systems may offer the possibility to overcome the above issues as reported. In this research, a series of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-activated CPT prodrugs were designed and synthesized by coupling water-soluble pentapeptide, a PSMA hydrolyzing substrate, to CPT through an appropriate linker. The cytotoxicity of CPT prodrugs was masked temporarily until they were hydrolyzed by the PSMA present within the tumor sites, which restored cytotoxicity. The in vitro selective cytotoxic activities of the prodrugs were evaluated against PSMA-expressing human prostate cancer cells LNCaP-FGC and non-PSMA-expressing cancer cells HepG2, Hela, MCF-7, DU145, PC-3 and normal cells MDCK, LO2 by standard methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Most of the newly synthesized CPT prodrugs showed excellent selective toxicity to PSMA-producing prostate cancer cells LNCaP-FGC with improved water solubility. From among the library, CPT-HT-J-ZL12 showed the best cytotoxic selectivity between the PSMA-expressing and the non-PSMA-expressing cancer cells. For example, the cytotoxicity of CPT-HT-J-ZL12 (IC50 = 1.00 ± 0.20 µM) against LNCaP-FGC (PSMA⁺) was 40-fold, 40-fold, 21-fold, 5-fold and 40-fold, respectively, higher than that against the non-PSMA-expressing cells HepG2 (IC50 > 40.00 µM), Hela (IC50 > 40.00 µM), MCF-7 (IC50 = 21.68 ± 4.96 µM), DU145 (IC50 = 5.40 ± 1.22 µM), PC-3 (IC50 = 42.96 ± 3.69 µM) cells. Moreover, CPT-HT-J-ZL12 exhibited low cytotoxicity (IC50 > 40 μM) towards MDCK and LO2 cells. The cellular uptake experiment demonstrated the superior PSMA-targeting ability of the CPT-HT-J-ZL12, which was significantly accumulated in LNCaP-FGC (PSMA⁺), while it was minimized in HepG2 (PSMA-) cells. Further cell apoptosis analyses indicated that it showed a dramatically higher apoptosis-inducing activity in LNCaP-FGC (PSMA⁺) cells than in HepG2 (PSMA-) cells.

Platelets protect cancer cells from immune surveillance and exhibit many other prometastatic effects. Notably, platelets can change the epithelial tumor phenotype, a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which confers stem cell-like properties onto tumor cells associated with an increased motility and drug resistance. The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of heparin on the platelet induced EMT program in pancreatic and prostate tumor cells. Platelet activation and interaction with cancer cells were determined by static adhesion assays. Applying ELISAs, the platelet release of EMT inducing mediators was quantified. EMT marker protein expression by tumor cells was explored by western blot and qPCR. Our data show that different tumor cell entities have different platelet binding capacities and also that a weak interaction is sufficient to change tumor cell phenotype. Additionally, unfractionated heparin (UFH) as well as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) reduced tumor cell platelet interaction. Subsequently, attenuated platelet-derived mediator release resulted in reduced EMT marker protein and transcription factor expression by the cancer cells and decreased cell migration. These data suggest that heparin reduces platelet induced EMT program and prevents the formation of cancer cells with stem cell-like properties.

The diagnostic standard to confirm prostate cancer is the transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. However, this procedure is associated with the underdetection of clinically significant prostate cancer and therefore needs to be improved. In the last years MRI fusion based targeted biopsy gained importance as consequence. In this study, we evaluated the quality of MRI ultrasound image fusion and evaluated factors influencing the image fusion quality. This was done by comparing fusion quality with the histopathological findings in the defined MRI target on the one hand and the PIRADS score on the other hand.  Materials and methods:   Single arm study including patients with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) and a multiparametric MRI showing a suspicious lesion underwent a MRI fusion targeted biopsy at our institution. MRI fusion targeted biopsy and an additional 12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy was performed using the Philips Percunav device (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, WA). The fusion accuracy was rated by two experienced clinicians (1 radiologist, 18 years of experience, 1 urologist, 5 years of experience) using a five-point rank scale (1 = best) and comparing the result with the histological findings in the target and the PIRADS score.  Results:   The detection rate of clinically significant cancer (Gleason 7a or greater) by MRI-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy was 58.6% (17/29) compared to 50% (19/38) in the standard transrectal ultrasound-guided approach. PCa was found in 36.4% (4/11 patients) of patients with a PIRADS 3 lesion, in 57.7% (15/26 patients) of patients with a PIRADS 4 lesion. In 76.9% (10/13 patients) of patients with a PIRADS 5 lesion PCa was diagnosed. No statistical significance was found comparing the quality of registration either with the PIRADS (p = 0.7873) nor with the Gleason score (p = 0.4376). The study is limited by the small number of patients.  Conclusions:   MRI fusion based targeted biopsy improves the identification of clinical significant cancer. The Gleason score of detected PCa is not influenced by the quality of fusion.""","""['B Schlenker', 'M Apfelbeck', 'A Buchner', 'C Stief', 'D-A Clevert']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Hemorheol Microcirc""","""['Comparison of PIRADS 3 lesions with histopathological findings after MRI-fusion targeted biopsy of the prostate in a real world-setting.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with MRI image fusion for monitoring focal therapy of prostate cancer with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)1.', 'Real-time MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy in biopsy-naïve and pre-biopsied patients with suspicion for prostate cancer.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Data exploring real-world toxicity and outcomes are scarce.  Methods:   Retrospective study on unselected patients with mCRPC on AA plus steroids.  Results:   93 patients were included in the study. Median duration of treatment by AA was 7.5 months (95% CI 5.7-12) among the 58 patients pretreated with chemotherapy, versus 12.7 months ( 95% CI 8.2-35.9) among the 33 chemo-naive patients.

The selectivity analyses showed that 5f has excellent selectivity to ANO1 (>1000-fold over ANO2). In cellular assays, 5f significantly inhibited cell proliferation of PC3, MCF7, and BxPC3 cells expressing high levels of ANO1.

Material and methods:   We identified 4123 men with complete data treated by radical prostatectomy between 1988 and 2015. We tested the association between BMI and BCR using Cox models, and among men with BCR, prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) was compared across BMI categories using linear regression. Models were adjusted for age, race, prostate-specific antigen, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage, year and surgical centre.  Results:   Overall, 922 men (22%) were of normal weight (BMI <25 kg/m2 ), 1863 (45%) were overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2 ), 968 (24%) were obese (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2 ), and 370 (9%) were moderately or severely obese (BMI ≥35 kg/m2 ). After adjustment for multiple clinical characteristics, higher BMI was significantly associated with higher risk of BCR (P = 0.008). Among men with BCR, men in the four BMI categories had similar multivariable-adjusted PSADT values (increasing BMI categories: 20.9 vs 21.3 vs 21.0 vs 14.9 months; P = 0.48).

Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of PCa progression is of paramount importance to help determining the course of disease.

Methods:   We profiled the microRNA expression of 20 recurrent and 20 non-recurrent PCa patients with microRNA microarray, and validated the differential expression of significantly deregulated microRNAs in 40 recurrent and 39 non-recurrent PCa specimens using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Data were statistically analyzed using two-sided Student's t-test, Pearson Correlation test, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.  Results:   Our results demonstrated that a total of 682 probes were significantly deregulated in recurrent versus non-recurrent PCa specimen comparison. Among those, we confirmed the significant downregulation of miR-424 and upregulation of miR-572 with further qRT-PCR analysis in a larger sample set. Further ROC analysis showed that these microRNAs have enough power to distinguish recurrent specimens from non-recurrent ones on their own.

Novel N-terminal domain (NTD) binding AR-targeting compounds, including EPI-001 (EPI), have the promising ability to block constitutively active splice variants, which represent a major resistance mechanism in CRPC. Autophagy is a conserved lysosomal degradation pathway that acts as survival mechanism in cells exposed to anticancer treatments. We hypothesized, that promising NTD-AR treatment may upregulate autophagy and that a combination of NTD-AR and autophagy inhibition might therefore increase antitumor effects.  Methods:   AR-expressing prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, LNCaP-EnzR) were treated with different concentrations of EPI (10, 25, 50 μM) and in combination with the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine (CHQ, 20 μM) or 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 5 mM). Cell proliferation was assessed by WST-1-assays after 1 and 7 days. Ethidium bromide and Annexin V were used to measure viability and apoptosis on day 7 after treatment. Autophagosome formation was detected by AUTOdot staining. In addition, autophagic activity was monitored by immunocytochemistry and Western blot (WES) for the expression of ATG5, Beclin1, LC3-I/II and p62.  Results:   Treatment with EPI resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of cell growth and increased apoptosis in both cancer cell lines on day 7. In addition, EPI treatment demonstrated an upregulated autophagosome formation in LNCaP and LNCaP-EnzR cells. Assessment of autophagic activity by immunocytochemistry and WES revealed an increase of ATG5 and LC3-II expression and a decreased p62 expression in all EPI-treated cells. A combined treatment of EPI with autophagy inhibitors led to a further significant reduction of cell viability in both cell lines.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that NTD targeting AR inhibition using EPI leads to an increased autophagic activity in LNCaP and LNCaP-EnzR prostate cancer cells. A combination of NTD AR blockage with simultaneous autophagy inhibition increases the antitumor effect of EPI in prostate cancer cells.

We aimed to investigate and compare the effect of goserelin acetate with leuprolide acetate on total prostate volume (TPV), post voiding residue (PVR), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum flow rate (Qmax) reduction on cases of advanced Pca.  Methods:   Patients with advanced Pca were treated with goserelin acetate (10.8 mg/3 months) or leuprolide acetate (22.5 mg/3 months) for 6 months. Changes in Prostate specific antigen (PSA), testesterone level, TPV, IPSS, PVR, and Qmax were assessed every 3 months.  Results:   Fifty-one patients analyzed in this study.

Materials and Methods: Between March 2015 and September 2017, 111 patients underwent RALP by a single surgeon in our clinic. The learning curve was analyzed using the moving average method. We compared the rate of positive surgical margins(PSM) and oncological outcomes, operation times, hematocrit changes and duration of hospitalization among the patients during and after the LC. Complications were also noted according to Clavien system.  Results:   LC analysis using the moving average method showed that the LC stabilized between cases 51-60. So, patients were classified into two groups; 1-50 cases (Group 1) and 51-111 cases (Group 2). PSM rates were 36% for group 1 and 18% for group 2, and statistically different (p=0,032). Extracapsular invasion (ECI) was significantly higher in group 1 (56,5%) than in group 2 (29,5%) (p=0,005). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that presence of ECI was an independent factor for PSM associated with the groups (OR: 2.512; 95% CI: 1.055-5.979). Both operation time and duration of postoperative hospitalization were significantly reduced from group 1 to group 2. A total of 11 patients (10%) had complications and one of them (0,9%) required surgical intervention.

Androgen receptor (AR) plays a large role in the development and progression of PCa, even after castration. The present study aimed at investigating the effects of triptolide on AR protein stability and the possible mechanism. Materials and Methods: By blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX), the effect of triptolide on AR protein stability was investigated with western blot assay. The potential role of calpains in triptolide reduced AR protein stability was investigated with calpain inhibitor and Ca2+ chelator. Results: Triptolide down-regulated AR protein level when protein synthesis was blocked by CHX, demonstrating the decrease of AR protein stability. The AR protein level was restored when the cells were co-treated with triptolide and calpain inhibitor or Ca2+ chelator, indicating the important role of calpains. Conclusions: The results indicate that triptolide can activate calpain via promoting intracellular Ca2+ accumulation, and thus decrease the stability of AR protein, subsequently resulting in the breakdown of the AR protein in LNCaP cells.

Group 0 was a control group of 75 patients with no signs of bone metastases and group 1 included 56 patients with bone metastases.  Results:   We used stepwise selection multivariate logistic regression for choosing the multimarker formula for calculation of risk score for bone metastases diagnostics. For detection of bone metastasis, it was shown to be most effective measurement of 3 biomarkers: procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide, growth differentiation factor-15, and osteonectin and combining with calculation of risk score by designating measured concentrations in mathematical formula: bone risk score = procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide × 0.0500 + growth differentiation factor-15 × 1.4179 + osteonectin × 0.00555.

We have designed a novel polyethylene sack (ProSac) to improve the morcellation process following LEP. Both silicone and cadaver models were utilized to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ProSac.  Methods:   The inanimate model used tissue-mimicking silicone to accurately approximate bladder volume and compliance. The second model was developed using a fresh cadaver. Heat-fixed chicken breast was used to mimic enucleated prostatic adenoma. Morcellation of the simulated adenoma tissue was tested in both models with and without the ProSac. Morcellated tissue was removed from the filter, desiccated, and weighed after each run to establish morcellation efficiency. Visual inspection was used to evaluate for mucosal injury or bladder perforation. A hydromanometer was placed in the cadaveric bladder to measure bladder pressure.  Results:   The device was able to capture up to 30 g of tissue with good closure while maintaining good distention and visualization during morcellation. In the silicone model, morcellation efficiency with the device was 4.6 g/minute, while efficiency without the device was 2.6 g/minute (p = 0.03). In the cadaveric model, mean entrapment time was 22 ± 11 seconds. Morcellation efficiency with the device was 2.1 g/minute when excluding entrapment time and 1.9 g/minute including entrapment time. Without the ProSac, morcellation efficiency was 1.2 g/minute (p = 0.05). In both models, multiple mucosal injuries occurred without the device, while none occurred with the device. Bladder pressure was similar between study arms.  Conclusions:   The ProSac is a novel device that can provide additional safety during adenoma morcellation.

This information is not readily available for prostate cancer counseling because most patient reported outcomes are presented as averages, which minimize individual patient experiences. Using the EPIC (Expanded Prostate Index Composite) we present data to characterize the best case and the worst case after prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   The EPIC bowel, urinary irritation, continence and sexual function scores were measured in 1,418 men stratified by baseline function who underwent prostatectomy. Patient level functional trajectories were modeled using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The 5-year best and worst case outcomes were defined as the upper 95th and the lower 5th percentiles, respectively.  Results:   Five years after surgery in patients with good baseline urinary continence the best case was a score of 100.0 (95% credible interval 100.0-100.0) and the worst case was 54.4 (95% credible interval 42.2-63.7). Among men with good baseline sexual function who underwent nerve sparing surgery the best case was 83.9 points (95% credible interval 74.1-93.1) and the worst case was 17.6 (95% credible interval 7.5-26.1). The differences between best and worst case for bowel and urinary irritation were relatively small (11.4 and 13.6 points, respectively).  Conclusions:   Prostatectomy exerted a minimal negative impact on urinary irritation and bowel function with minimal variability. There was a larger range in patient experience for urinary continence and sexual function with most patients experiencing a significant functional decline.

We aimed to predict the risk of prostate cancer based on prostate specific antigen together with single nucleotide polymorphism information.  Materials and methods:   We performed a prospective study of 20,575 men with prostate specific antigen testing and 4,967 with a polygenic risk score for prostate cancer based on 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the Finnish population based screening trial of prostate cancer and 5,269 samples of 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the Finnish prostate cancer DNA study. A Bayesian predictive model was built to estimate the risk of prostate cancer by sequentially combining genetic information with prostate specific antigen compared with prostate specific antigen alone in study subjects limited to those with prostate specific antigen 4 ng/ml or above.  Results:   The posterior odds of prostate cancer based on 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms together with the prostate specific antigen level ranged from 3.7 at 4 ng/ml, 14.2 at 6 and 40.7 at 8 to 98.2 at 10 ng/ml. The ROC AUC was elevated to 88.8% (95% CI 88.6-89.1) for prostate specific antigen combined with the risk score based on 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms compared with 70.1% (95% CI 69.6-70.7) for prostate specific antigen alone. It was further escalated to 96.7% (95% CI 96.5-96.9) when all prostate cancer susceptibility polygenes were combined.  Conclusions:   Expedient use of multiple genetic variants together with information on prostate specific antigen levels better predicts the risk of prostate cancer than prostate specific antigen alone and allows for higher prostate specific antigen cutoffs. Combined information also provides a basis for risk stratification which can be used to optimize the performance of prostate cancer screening.""","""['Sam Li-Sheng Chen', 'Jean Ching-Yuan Fann', 'Csilla Sipeky', 'Teng-Kai Yang', 'Sherry Yueh-Hsia Chiu', 'Amy Ming-Fang Yen', 'Virpi Laitinen', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Ulf-Håkan Stenman', 'Anssi Auvinen', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'Hsiu-Hsi Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'A genetic score can identify men at high risk for prostate cancer among men with prostate-specific antigen of 1-3 ng/ml.', 'Single nucleotide polymorphisms and the likelihood of prostate cancer at a given prostate specific antigen level.', 'Polygenic hazard score to guide screening for aggressive prostate cancer: development and validation in large scale cohorts.', 'A genetic-based approach to personalized prostate cancer screening and treatment.', 'A multiparametric approach to improve upon existing prostate cancer screening and biopsy recommendations.', 'The Combined Effect of Polygenic Risk Score and Prostate Health Index in Chinese Men Undergoing Prostate Biopsy.', 'Interleukin-13 rs1800925/-1112C/T promoter single nucleotide polymorphism variant linked to anti-schistosomiasis in adult males in Murehwa District, Zimbabwe.', 'Germline Genetics of Prostate Cancer: Prevalence of Risk Variants and Clinical Implications for Disease Management.', 'Population-Based Comparison of Different Risk Stratification Systems Among Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Cost effectiveness analysis of a polygenic risk tailored breast cancer screening programme in Singapore.']"""

Aim of our study was to determine the usefulness of USPSA as predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Methods:   This retrospective study included 213 prostate cancer patients who had a postoperative USPSA between 0.01 and 0.2 ng/mL and at least 2 years of follow-up. We developed predictive models for BCR with PSA ≥0.2 and ≥0.5 ng/mL.  Results:   A total of 103 patients (48.3%) had BCR at a median follow-up of 13.3 months. Higher postoperative USPSA (odds ratio [OR] = 4.73, P < 0.01), bilateral positive surgical margin in both sides (OR = 1.32, P = 0.044), higher average PSA rise (OR = 1.67, P = 0.031), ISUP grade group ≥3 (OR = 1.48, P = 0.003), and shorter interval since RARP (OR = 0.58, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of BCR with PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL. Higher postoperative USPSA (OR = 3.85, P < 0.01), bilateral positive surgical margin (OR = 1.34, P = 0.011), ISUP grade group ≥3 (OR = 1.5, P = 0.002), and shorter interval since RARP (OR = 0.61, P = 0.001) were independent predictors of BCR with PSA ≥0.5 ng/mL.

Based on data from genome‑wide association study of the Consortium for Chinese Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics, rs1815009 and rs2684788 inside 3'UTR of insulin‑like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) presented significant genotype distribution between PCa and control samples. In the current study, targeting miRNAs were predicted using TargetScan and miRanda. The prediction was confirmed using a thermodynamic model for miRNA‑target interaction and luciferase reporter assays for miRNA binding inside IGF1R 3'UTR. Furthermore, data from public databases and miRNA overexpression further supported miRNAs function. The results suggested that miR‑133a and miR‑133b may bind near rs1815009, and miR‑455 near rs2684788, within IGF1R 3'UTR.

Furthermore, upregulation of miR‑505‑3p suppressed the activity of TGF‑β signaling by directly targeting downstream effectors of TGF‑β signaling, SMAD2 and SMAD3, further inhibiting the invasion and migration abilities of PCa cells.

Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the clinical value and associated molecular mechanism of microRNA (miR)‑1 in PCa. A meta‑analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnosis of miR‑1 in PCa via Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress datasets, The Cancer Genome Atlas miR‑1 expression data and published literature. It was identified that expression of miR‑1 was significantly downregulated in PCa. Decreased miR‑1 expression possessed moderate diagnostic value, with area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity and odds ratio values at 0.73, 0.77, 0.57 and 4.60, respectively. Using bioinformatics methods, it was revealed that a number of pathways, including the 'androgen receptor signaling pathway', 'androgen receptor activity', 'transcription factor binding' and 'protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum', were important in PCa. A total of seven hub genes, including phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase and phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide synthase (PAICS), cadherin 1 (CDH1), SRC proto‑oncogene, non‑receptor tyrosine kinase, twist family bHLH transcription factor 1 (TWIST1), ZW10 interacting kinetochore protein (ZWINT), PCNA clamp associated factor (KIAA0101) and androgen receptor, among which, five (PAICS, CDH1, TWIST1, ZWINT and KIAA0101) were significantly upregulated and negatively correlated with miR‑1, were identified as key miR‑1 target genes in PCa. Additionally, it was investigated whether miR‑1 and its hub genes were associated with clinical features, including age, tumor status, residual tumor, lymph node metastasis, pathological T stage and prostate specific antigen level. Collectively the results suggest that miR‑1 may be involved in the progression of PCa, and consequently be a promising diagnostic marker. The 'androgen receptor signaling pathway', 'androgen receptor activity', 'transcription factor binding' and 'protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum' may be crucial interactive pathways in PCa.

The proliferative, invasive and migratory capacities of DU145 cells were analyzed using Cell Counting Kit‑8, transwell and wound healing assays, respectively. The expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2 and MMP‑9 were determined with an ELISA. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting assays were performed to evaluate the expression levels of extracellular matrix, epithelial‑mesenchymal transition and Wnt/β‑catenin pathway‑associated factors. In the present study, it was observed that Zey not only suppressed the viability of DU145 cells; however, it additionally attenuated the invasive and migratory capacities of cells in a concentration‑dependent manner. Treatment of Zey decreased the expression levels of MMP‑2, MMP‑9 and fibronectin‑1; whereas, it increased tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases‑1 and collagen‑1 expression levels. Additionally, the vimentin expression level was downregulated, however, the epithelial‑cadherin expression level was upregulated in cells treated with Zey. Furthermore, Zey decreased the expression levels of wnt5a, β‑catenin and cyclin D1.

However, the risk association was short term as neither HDL or LDL measured 3 years earlier had an effect on PCa prognosis. Modest statin-induced cholesterol decline lowered the risk of PCa recurrence. Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) by modest total cholesterol and LDL declines were 0.24 (0.09-0.60) and 0.31 (0.11-0.88), respectively.  Conclusions:   The findings do not support cholesterol as a risk factor for PCa severity or prognosis after prostatectomy.

Of the patients, 82 had large prostatic calculi visualised by transrectal ultrasonography and 88 did not or had scarce prostatic calculi. We divided these patients into two groups: patients with large prostatic calculi (group 1) and patients without prostatic calculi (group 2). These groups were compared according to age, total prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, prostate volume, and final pathological diagnosis.  Results:   The mean age of all patients was 61.4 ± 6.2 years, the mean total PSA was 12.3 ± 17.4 ng/mL, the mean prostate volume was 41.7 ± 17.6 mL, and the overall cancer detection rate was 31.5%.

Advanced age, androgen stimulation, and ethnicity have been reported to be possible risk factors. It has been suggested that particular genetic polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferases (GST), xenobiotic-metabolising enzymes, could predispose to prostate cancer through heritable deficiency in detoxification of environmental carcinogens. Conflicts in the published results and the absence of similar in depth studies in Algeria prompted us to perform the present case-control study of GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and their possible association with PCa in an Algerian population. Methods: We determined GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes for 49 histologically verified prostate cancer patients and in 41 age-matched healthy controls by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using peripheral blood DNA samples. Result: While an association between the GSTM1 null genotype and PCa risk (OR= 3.69, 95% CI= 1.30-10.44; P = 0.01) was evident, the GSTT1 null genotype (OR= 0.92, 95% IC= 0.32-2.62; P = 0.49) appeared without influence. Furthermore, no statistically significant differences between the double null genotype and PCa is detected, also no statistically significant differences between smoking status and PCa is detected. Conclusion: The GSTM1 null genotype may increase individual susceptibility to prostate cancer. On the other hand, the null-activity genotype of GSTT1 did not appear to contribute to the risk of prostate cancer in our population.""","""['Maroua Benabdelkrim', 'Omar Djeffal', 'Hajira Berredjem']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Polymorphism of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes in prostate cancer: a study from North India.', 'Glutathione S-transferase gene polymorphisms (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1) and prostate cancer: a case-control study in Tehran, Iran.', 'Association of genetic polymorphism of glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1) with bladder cancer susceptibility.', 'Association of GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms with early pregnancy loss in an Indian population and a meta-analysis.', 'GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk in Asians: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association of Androgen-Receptor Gene Mutations with the Copy Number of Androgen-Receptor Silk Protein A Complex and Glutathione-S-Transferases T1 and M1 in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Association of glutathione S-transferases (GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1) genes polymorphisms with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease susceptibility: A PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Relationship between GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and HPV infection: a systematic review.', 'A Review of Cancer Genetics and Genomics Studies in Africa.', 'Polymorphism of glutathione S-transferase in the population of Polish patients with carcinoma of the prostate.']"""

The use of intra-prostatic gold fiducial markers for daily prostate position verification and correction before and during treatment delivery (image-guided radiotherapy, IGRT) is widely used in the radiation therapy centers to accurately target the prostate. Usually, the fiducial markers are implanted through the rectum, with complications such as infections and rectal bleeding. We report our experience in prostate fiducial markers implantation through a transperineal approach.  Patients and methods:   Between September 2011 and January 2018 at our center, 101 patients underwent gold seed fiducial marker transperineal ultrasound-guided implantation for prostate IGRT. We retrospectively reviewed their features and outcome. Twenty-two (21.8%) patients had previously been subjected to a transurethral prostate resection (TURP) for obstructive urinary symptoms because of benign prostatic hypertrophy. No antibiotic prophylaxis was used.  Results:   The procedure was well tolerated. In one patient, a single episode of self-limiting urinary bleeding occurred just after it. No other complication was recorded. All the patients, at the evaluation before discharge, reported no pain or dysuria. No rectal bleeding, hematospermia, urinary obstruction or infection were reported in the next days. No markers lost or migration occurred.  Discussion and conclusion:   According to our experience, prostate fiducial markers implantation through a transperineal approach is safe and should be recommended to limit the use of antibiotic therapy and patients morbidity.

Clinical and animal model studies indicate that adipose stromal cells (ASC), the progenitors of adipocytes, are recruited by tumors and promote tumor growth as tumor stromal cells. Here, we investigated the role of ASC in cancer chemoresistance and invasiveness, the attributes of tumor aggressiveness. By using human cell co-culture models, we demonstrate that ASC induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer cells. Our results for the first time demonstrate that ASC interaction renders cancer cells more migratory and resistant to docetaxel, cabazitaxel, and cisplatin chemotherapy. To confirm these findings in vivo, we compared cancer aggressiveness in lean and obese mice grafted with prostate tumors. We show that obesity promotes EMT in cancer cells and tumor invasion into the surrounding fat tissue. A hunter-killer peptide D-CAN, previously developed for targeted ASC ablation, suppressed the obesity-associated EMT and cancer progression. Importantly, cisplatin combined with D-CAN was more effective than cisplatin alone in suppressing growth of mouse prostate cancer allografts and xenografts even in non-obese mice.

In addition to its cardiovascular properties, its anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic traits are believed to play important roles in carcinogenesis. The present study examines the influence of Ang1-7 on processes associated with development and progression of prostate cancer cells. Our findings indicate that while Ang1-7 (1 nM; 48 h) can effectively reduce cell proliferation in DU-145, it can induce a significant decrease in the expression of MKI67 in LNCaP. In both cell lines we also observed a reduction in colony size in soft agar assay. A various changes in gene expression were noted after exposure to Ang1-7: those of anti- and pro-apoptotic agents and the NF-kB family of transcription factors, as well as mesenchymal cell markers and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). In addition, Ang1-7 was found to modulate cell adhesion and matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) activity. Changes were also observed in the levels of angiotensin receptors and sex steroid hormone receptors. Ang1-7 reduced the levels of estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) and increased the expression of estrogen receptor beta gene (ESR2) in all prostate cancer cells; it also up-regulated androgen receptor (AR) expression in androgen-sensitive cells but contradictory effect was observed in androgen- irresponsive cell lines. In summary, the results confirm the existence of complex network between the various elements of the local RAS and the molecular and cellular mechanisms of prostate cancerogenesis.

Patients were divided into several subgroups and the data was evaluated statistically using absolute and relative values. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in WBC (p=0.007), NC (p=0.031) and PLT (p=0.026) count decrease (absolute values) after treatment, between two treatment methods (CRT and IMRT), all in favor of IMRT. The relationship still proves to be significant regarding WBC (p=0,02) and (NC) (p=0,049) after presenting the data as relative percentage loss of starting value. However using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE), PLT count toxicity was more common in IMRT group (p=0.045). Conclusion: IMRT in comparison to CRT in bladder and prostate cancer patients is associated with a lesser absolute and relative decrease of hematologic indices. The hematologic effect of radiation was observed mainly regarding LC. Patients treated with IMRT suffered from significantly lesser decrease in relative and absolute values of WBC and NC. The mean of absolute PLT decrease count was lower in IMRT group; however, toxicity according to CTCAE was slightly more prevalent in IMRT group.""","""['Marcin Miszczyk', 'Wojciech Majewski']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['A comparison of morbidity following conformal versus intensity-modulated radiotherapy for urinary bladder cancer.', 'Influence of organ motion on conformal vs. intensity-modulated pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Whole pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer using 3D conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Benefit of intensity modulated and image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Acute toxicity with intensity modulated radiotherapy versus 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy during preoperative chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer.', 'Dosimetric and Hematologic Implications of Prostate-Only Versus Whole Pelvic Radiotherapy: Results of the Multicentric Phase 3 PROPER Study.', 'Reference Results for Blood Parameter Changes and Recovery after Pelvic Radiation without Chemotherapy.', 'Hematological Changes Following Low Dose Radiation Therapy and Comparison to Current Standard of Care Cancer Treatments.', 'Effect of Radiotherapy and Low-Level Laser Therapy on Circulating Blood Cells of Rats.']"""

Materials and methods:   DU-145 cells were cultured as spheroids in 300 micron diameter. Then the following treatments were conducted: (a) EBRT at doses of either 2 Gy or 4 Gy of photon 15 MV, (b) HT for 0, 30, 60, and 90 minutes duration at 43 °C from a 13.56 MHz radiofrequency capacitive heating device (Celsius TCS), (c) BR with Ir-192 seed at doses of either 2 Gy or 5.5 Gy, (d) The mentioned HT followed by EBRT (HT + EBRT) and (e) EBRT followed by BR (EBRT + BR).

The incidence of prostate cancer is continuously increasing across the globe and the existing treatment options for this disease are limited and associated with a lot of side effects. Therefore there is an urgent need to identify novel and efficient therapeutic agents for the management of prostate cancer. In the current study we evaluated the anticancer activity of royleanone diterpenoid against prostate cancer LNCaP cell line.  Methods:   The anticancer activity of royleanone was determined by CCK8 assay. Apoptosis was detected by acridine orange and ethidium bromide as well as by annexin V/ propidium iodide (PI) staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cell cycle analysis were investigated by flow cytometry and protein expression by western blotting.  Results:   The results showed that royleanone exerts potent anticancer activity on LNCaP prostate cancer cells with an IC50 of 12.5 μM at 48 hrs of incubation. The anticancer activity of royleanone was due to induction of cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, royleanone could also suppress the cell migration potential and inhibited the mTOR/ PI3/AKT signalling pathway in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Taken together, we propose that royleanone could prove to be an important anticancer lead molecule for the treatment and overall management of prostate cancer, provided further in vivo studies are carried out.""","""['Xiaoming Wu', 'Yi He', 'Gaoyue Zhang', 'Jianhui Wu', 'Yansong Hou', 'Yanqin Gu', 'Hao Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['Anticancer effects of kaempferol in A375 human malignant melanoma cells are mediated via induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, inhibition of cell migration and downregulation of m-TOR/PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'Anticancer action of lactucopicrin in SKMEL-5 human skin cancer cells is mediated via apoptosis induction, G2/M cell cycle arrest and downregulation of m=TOR/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.', 'Anticancer effects of α-Bisabolol in human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells are mediated via apoptosis induction, cell cycle arrest, inhibition of cell migration and invasion and upregulation of P13K/AKT signalling pathway.', 'Signalling transduction of O-GlcNAcylation and PI3K/AKT/mTOR-axis in prostate cancer.', 'Berberine: An Important Emphasis on Its Anticancer Effects through Modulation of Various Cell Signaling Pathways.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'The Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Advances on Natural Abietane, Labdane and Clerodane Diterpenes as Anti-Cancer Agents: Sources and Mechanisms of Action.', 'Inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway in Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention and Intervention.', 'miR-31 Modulates Liver Cancer HepG2 Cell Apoptosis and Invasion via ROCK1/F-Actin Pathways.']"""

Glypican-1 (GPC1+) exosomes may serve as a noninvasive diagnostic tool to detect early stages of PDAC. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the serum GPC1 levels and determine whether serum GPC1 serves as a novel biomarker for PDAC patients. Blood samples were collected from 156 patients with PDAC, 199 non-cancer controls, and 240 patients with other cancers. Serological levels of GPC1 were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Finally, a 5-year follow-up was monitored to evaluate the correlation between serum GPC1 levels and overall survival in 156 patients with PDAC. The results suggested that levels of serum GPC1 and CA19-9 were higher in PDAC patients than that of controls (P < 0.05). Serum GPC1 levels in PDAC were different from those in gallbladder carcinoma (P < 0.001), colorectal carcinoma (P < 0.001), gastric carcinoma (P < 0.001), and prostate cancer (P < 0.001), but not hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.395) and cholangiocarcinoma (P = 0.724). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed that serum CA19-9 was significantly better than serum GPC1 in distinguishing PDAC patients from the controls (AUC, 95% CI: 0.908, 0.868-0.947 vs 0.795, 0.749-0.841, respectively). The serum GPC1 cannot be used as a serum diagnostic biomarker for PDAC patients. The level of serum GPC1 decreased 2 days after surgery (P = 0.001), which were not different from serum GPC1 levels in healthy control (P = 0.381). The overall survival rate was shorter in patients with high levels of serum GPC1 compared to those with low levels of serum GPC1 (log-rank = 5.16, P = 0.023). Taken together, the results indicate that high levels of serum GPC1 predict poor prognosis in PDAC patients.

APMs were compared between two experience levels: experts (100-750 cases) and super-experts (2100-3500 cases). Clinical outcomes (peri-operative, oncological and functional) were then compared between the two groups. APMs and outcomes were analysed for 125 RARPs using multi-level mixed-effect modelling.  Results:   For the four cardinal steps selected, super-experts showed differences in select APMs compared with experts (P < 0.05). Despite similar PSA and Gleason scores, super-experts outperformed experts clinically with regard to peri-operative outcomes, with a greater lymph node yield of 22.6 vs 14.9 nodes, respectively (P < 0.01), less blood loss (125 vs 130 mL, respectively; P < 0.01), and fewer readmissions at 30 days (1% vs 13%, respectively; P = 0.02). A similar but nonsignificant trend was seen for oncological and functional outcomes, with super-experts having a lower rate of biochemical recurrence compared with experts (5% vs 15%, respectively; P = 0.13) and a higher continence rate at 3 months (36% vs 18%, respectively; P = 0.14).

These percentages are even larger in high-income countries with 58% overweight/obese and 33% insufficiently active. Fourteen cancer types have been declared by the World Cancer Research Fund to be causally associated with being overweight or obese: oesophageal adenocarcinoma, stomach cardia, colon, rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, breast, endometrium, ovary, advanced/fatal prostate, kidney, thyroid and multiple myeloma. Colon, postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancers have also been judged causally associated with physical inactivity. We aimed to quantify the proportion of cancer cases that would be potentially avoidable in Australia if the prevalence of overweight/obesity and physical inactivity in the population could be reduced. We used the simulation modelling software PREVENT 3.01 to calculate the proportion of avoidable cancers over a 25-year period under different theoretical intervention scenarios that change the prevalence of overweight/obesity and physical inactivity in the population. Between 2013 and 2037, 10-13% of overweight/obesity-related cancers in men and 7-11% in women could be avoided if overweight and obesity were eliminated in the Australian population. If everyone in the population met the Australian physical activity guidelines for cancer prevention (i.e. engaged in at least 300 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week), an estimated 2-3% of physical inactivity-related cancers could be prevented in men (colon cancer) and 1-2% in women (colon, breast and endometrial cancers). This would translate to the prevention of up to 190,500 overweight/obesity-related cancers and 19,200 inactivity-related cancers over 25 years.""","""['Louise F Wilson', 'Peter D Baade', 'Adele C Green', 'Susan J Jordan', 'Bradley J Kendall', 'Rachel E Neale', 'Catherine M Olsen', 'Danny R Youlden', 'Penelope M Webb', 'David C Whiteman']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Cancers in Australia in 2010 attributable to overweight and obesity.', 'The impact of reducing alcohol consumption in Australia: An estimate of the proportion of potentially avoidable cancers 2013-2037.', 'Avoidable cancer cases in the Nordic countries - The impact of overweight and obesity.', 'Weight control and physical activity in cancer prevention: international evaluation of the evidence.', 'Obesity and diabetes epidemics: cancer repercussions.', 'An ecological study of obesity-related cancer incidence trends in Australia from 1983 to 2017.', 'Prevalence, Associated Factors and Psychological Determinants of Obesity among Adults in Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Diabetes Care: A Position Statement of the Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists.']"""

We found that high c-myc level was significantly associated with HIF-1α elevated expression (p = 0.008) in our 72 samples. Statistical analysis of 497 TCGA prostate cancer specimens confirmed the strong association (p = 0.0005) of c-myc and HIF-1α expression levels, as we found in our series. Moreover, we found high c-myc levels significantly associated with low Glutatione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) expression (p = 0.01), with high Transketolase (TKT) expression (p < 0.0001). High TKT levels were found in TCGA samples with low GSTP1 mRNA (p < 0.0001), as shown for c-myc, and with ERG increased expression (p = 0.02). Finally, samples with low GSTP1 expression displayed higher ERG mRNA levels than samples with high GSTP1 score (p < 0.0001), as above shown for c-myc.

However, for large tumors, multiple insertions of the laser probe would be needed to achieve full coverage of the tumor, increasing the complexity of the treatment and occasionally resulting in the incomplete killing of tumor cells due to a mismatch between the planned insertion location and the actual probe insertion location. Treatment with a dual-fiber laser results in greater lesion coverage following a single insertion of the probe, with the lesion coverage being even greater than the sum of the coverage of two sequential insertion of a single-fiber laser probe, potentially reducing treatment time and clinical complications. Both theoretical and experimental analyses have been performed to evaluate the proposed dual-fiber laser treatment. A finite element model was established to simulate the treatment process. The simulation results indicated that there is a clear difference between the ablation coverage created using dual-fiber laser ablation and that created using the superposition of sequential single-fiber laser ablation. In addition, the coverage is dependent on the spacing distance between the two fibers. Both ex vivo and in vivo canine prostate tissues were treated by dual-fiber laser ablation, with lesions analyzed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound imaging, and pathology. The results demonstrate that dual-fiber laser ablation can markedly increase the range of the ablation zone when compared with single-fiber modes. The safety and feasibility of dual-fiber laser treatment has been confirmed, and a treatment plan using dual-fiber laser ablation has also been proposed.""","""['Xing Wu', 'Kangwei Zhang', 'Yini Chen', 'Ren Wang', 'Lei Chen', 'Aili Zhang', 'Bing Hu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Evaluation of tumor coverage after MR-guided prostate focal laser ablation therapy.', 'Focal Laser Ablation of Prostate Cancer: Phase I Clinical Trial.', 'Focal Laser Ablation of Prostate Cancer: An Office Procedure.', 'MRI-guided interventions for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided Thermal Therapy for Localized and Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Optimization of laser dosimetry based on patient-specific anatomical models for the ablation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor.', 'Measurement of Ex Vivo Liver, Brain and Pancreas Thermal Properties as Function of Temperature.']"""

We aimed to compare standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer, with and without radiotherapy.  Methods:   We did a randomised controlled phase 3 trial at 117 hospitals in Switzerland and the UK. Eligible patients had newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer. We randomly allocated patients open-label in a 1:1 ratio to standard of care (control group) or standard of care and radiotherapy (radiotherapy group). Randomisation was stratified by hospital, age at randomisation, nodal involvement, WHO performance status, planned androgen deprivation therapy, planned docetaxel use (from December, 2015), and regular aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Standard of care was lifelong androgen deprivation therapy, with up-front docetaxel permitted from December, 2015. Men allocated radiotherapy received either a daily (55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks) or weekly (36 Gy in six fractions over 6 weeks) schedule that was nominated before randomisation. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured as the number of deaths; this analysis had 90% power with a one-sided α of 2·5% for a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·75. Secondary outcomes were failure-free survival, progression-free survival, metastatic progression-free survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, and symptomatic local event-free survival. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards and flexible parametric models, adjusted for stratification factors. The primary outcome analysis was by intention to treat. Two prespecified subgroup analyses tested the effects of prostate radiotherapy by baseline metastatic burden and radiotherapy schedule. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00268476.  Findings:   Between Jan 22, 2013, and Sept 2, 2016, 2061 men underwent randomisation, 1029 were allocated the control and 1032 radiotherapy. Allocated groups were balanced, with a median age of 68 years (IQR 63-73) and median amount of prostate-specific antigen of 97 ng/mL (33-315). 367 (18%) patients received early docetaxel. 1082 (52%) participants nominated the daily radiotherapy schedule before randomisation and 979 (48%) the weekly schedule. 819 (40%) men had a low metastatic burden, 1120 (54%) had a high metastatic burden, and the metastatic burden was unknown for 122 (6%). Radiotherapy improved failure-free survival (HR 0·76, 95% CI 0·68-0·84; p<0·0001) but not overall survival (0·92, 0·80-1·06; p=0·266). Radiotherapy was well tolerated, with 48 (5%) adverse events (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3-4) reported during radiotherapy and 37 (4%) after radiotherapy. The proportion reporting at least one severe adverse event (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or worse) was similar by treatment group in the safety population (398 [38%] with control and 380 [39%] with radiotherapy).  Interpretation:   Radiotherapy to the prostate did not improve overall survival for unselected patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer.

End points were local control, pain control, and adverse events. Local control was defined as elimination, shrinkage, or stable disease in the tumor on imaging evaluations. Pain status was measured on a scale of 0 to 10 by patients' self-reports, and pain response was defined as the time at which pain scale score decreased by 2 or more from the baseline score without increase in analgesics. In addition, various treatment- and tumor-specific factors were evaluated to determine predictive values for local and pain control.  Results:   This study included 134 lesions in 131 patients, with: lesion histopathology, lung/colorectal/thyroid/renal/breast/prostate/sarcoma/other cancer, 24/22/18/14/12/10/6/25; reirradiation stereotactic body radiotherapy, 82 (61.2%) cases; and postoperative stereotactic body radiotherapy for epidural spinal cord compression, 45 (33.6%) cases.

The recent success of immunotherapy in high-frequency MSI (MSI-H) and/or MMR-D tumors now supports testing for MSI in all advanced solid tumors. The extent to which LS accounts for MSI-H across heterogeneous tumor types is unknown. Here, we establish the prevalence of LS across solid tumors according to MSI status.  Methods:   MSI status was determined using targeted next-generation sequencing, with tumors classified as MSI-H, MSI-indeterminate, or microsatellite-stable. Matched germline DNA was analyzed for mutations in LS-associated mismatch repair genes ( MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM). In patients with LS with MSI-H/I tumors, immunohistochemical staining for MMR-D was assessed.  Results:   Among 15,045 unique patients (more than 50 cancer types), LS was identified in 16.3% (53 of 326), 1.9% (13 of 699), and 0.3% (37 of 14,020) of patients with MSI-H, MSI-indeterminate, and microsatellite-stable tumors, respectively ( P < .001). Among patients with LS with MSI-H/I tumors, 50% (33 of 66) had tumors other than CRC/EC, including urothelial, prostate, pancreas, adrenocortical, small bowel, sarcoma, mesothelioma, melanoma, gastric, and germ cell tumors. In these patients with non-CRC/EC tumors, 45% (15 of 33) did not meet LS genetic testing criteria on the basis of personal/family history. Immunohistochemical staining of LS-positive MSI-H/I tumors demonstrated MMR-D in 98.2% (56 of 57) of available cases.  Conclusion:   MSI-H/MMR-D is predictive of LS across a much broader tumor spectrum than currently appreciated. Given implications for cancer surveillance and prevention measures in affected families, these data support germline genetic assessment for LS for patients with an MSI-H/MMR-D tumor, regardless of cancer type or family cancer history.""","""['Alicia Latham', 'Preethi Srinivasan', 'Yelena Kemel', 'Jinru Shia', 'Chaitanya Bandlamudi', 'Diana Mandelker', 'Sumit Middha', 'Jaclyn Hechtman', 'Ahmet Zehir', 'Marianne Dubard-Gault', 'Christina Tran', 'Carolyn Stewart', 'Margaret Sheehan', 'Alexander Penson', 'Deborah DeLair', 'Rona Yaeger', 'Joseph Vijai', 'Semanti Mukherjee', 'Jesse Galle', 'Mark A Dickson', 'Yelena Janjigian', ""Eileen M O'Reilly"", 'Neil Segal', 'Leonard B Saltz', 'Diane Reidy-Lagunes', 'Anna M Varghese', 'Dean Bajorin', 'Maria I Carlo', 'Karen Cadoo', 'Michael F Walsh', 'Martin Weiser', 'Julio Garcia Aguilar', 'David S Klimstra', 'Luis A Diaz Jr', 'Jose Baselga', 'Liying Zhang', 'Marc Ladanyi', 'David M Hyman', 'David B Solit', 'Mark E Robson', 'Barry S Taylor', 'Kenneth Offit', 'Michael F Berger', 'Zsofia K Stadler']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Errata.', 'Tumor Testing for Microsatellite Instability to Identify Lynch Syndrome: New Insights Into an Old Diagnostic Strategy.', 'Lynch Syndrome: Widening the Net.', 'High predictability for identifying Lynch syndrome via microsatellite instability testing or immunohistochemistry in all Lynch-associated tumor types.', 'Screening for Lynch syndrome in young Saudi colorectal cancer patients using microsatellite instability testing and next generation sequencing.', 'Prevalence and Clinical Implications of Mismatch Repair-Proficient Colorectal Cancer in Patients With Lynch Syndrome.', 'Association of tumor morphology with mismatch-repair protein status in older endometrial cancer patients: implications for universal versus selective screening strategies for Lynch syndrome.', 'Lynch or not Lynch?

Such a radioligand may be of interest also for PET imaging, possibly enabling better visualization of even small metastases at late time-points after injection. The aim of this study was, therefore, to modify PSMA-ALB-56 by exchanging the DOTA chelator with a NODAGA chelator for stable coordination of 64Cu ( T1/2 = 12.7 h; Eβ+av = 278 keV). The resulting NODAGA-functionalized PSMA-ALB-89 ligand, and the previously establish DOTA-functionalized PSMA-ALB-56 ligand were labeled with 64Cu and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Both radioligands showed plasma protein-binding properties in vitro and PSMA-specific uptake in PC-3 PIP cells. Biodistribution studies, performed in tumor-bearing mice, revealed high accumulation of 64Cu-PSMA-ALB-89 in PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumor xenografts (25.9 ± 3.41% IA/g at 1 h p.i.), which was further increased at later time-points (65.1 ± 7.82% IA/g at 4 h p.i. and 97.1 ± 7.01% IA/g at 24 h p.i.). High uptake of 64Cu-PSMA-ALB-89 was also seen in the kidneys, however, 64Cu-PSMA-ALB-89 was efficiently excreted over time. Mice injected with 64Cu-PSMA-ALB-56 showed increased accumulation of radioactivity in the liver (25.3 ± 4.20% IA/g) when compared to the liver uptake of 64Cu-PSMA-ALB-89 (4.88 ± 0.21% IA/g, at 4 h p.i.). This was most probably due to in vivo instability of the 64Cu-DOTA complex, which was also the reason for lower tumor uptake (49.7 ± 16.1% IA/g at 4 h p.i. and 28.3 ± 3.59% IA/g at 24 h p.i.). PET/CT imaging studies confirmed these findings and enabled excellent visualization of the PSMA-positive tumor xenografts in vivo after injection of 64Cu-PSMA-ALB-89. These data indicate that 64Cu-PSMA-ALB-89 is favorable over 64Cu-PSMA-ALB-56 with regard to the in vivo stability and tissue distribution profile. Moreover, 64Cu-PSMA-ALB-89 outperformed previously developed 64Cu-labeled PSMA ligands. Further optimization of long-circulating PSMA-targeting PET radioligands will be necessary before translating this concept to the clinics.""","""['Christoph A Umbricht', 'Martina Benešová', 'Roger Hasler', 'Roger Schibli', 'Nicholas P van der Meulen', 'Cristina Müller']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Optimization of the Tissue Distribution Profile.', 'Preclinical Development of Novel PSMA-Targeting Radioligands: Modulation of Albumin-Binding Properties To Improve Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Development of a new class of PSMA radioligands comprising ibuprofen as an albumin-binding entity.', 'Copper, PET/CT and prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Peptide and pseudo-peptide.', '64Cu-DOTHA2-PSMA, a Novel PSMA PET Radiotracer for Prostate Cancer with a Long Imaging Time Window.', 'Advances in PSMA theranostics.', 'Radiosynthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of Bispecific PSMA/FAP Heterodimers for Tumor Imaging.', 'The Effect of Albumin-Binding Moiety on Tumor Targeting and Biodistribution Properties of 67Ga-Labeled Albumin Binder-Conjugated Alpha-Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone Peptides.', 'Preclinical and Clinical Status of PSMA-Targeted Alpha Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

To further explore this relationship, we conducted a study within the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.  Methods:   Among 153 730 eligible men enrolled in the NIH-AARP cohort from 1995 to 1996 (median follow-up = 15.1 years), we identified 630 fatal PCA cases and 16 896 incident cases. BMI was assessed for ages 18, 35 and 50 and at study entry, enabling examination of latent class-identified BMI trajectories. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   BMI at study entry (mean age = 63, HR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.24, per 5-unit increase) and maximum BMI during adulthood (HR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.24, per 5-unit increase) shared modest associations with increased risk of fatal PCA. Smoking status likely modified the relationship between BMI trajectories and fatal PCA (Pinteraction = 0.035 via change-in-estimate variable section, P = 0.065 via full a priori model). Among never-smokers, BMI trajectory of normal weight to obesity was associated with increased risk of fatal disease (HR = 2.37; 95% CI = 1.38, 4.09), compared with the maintained normal weight trajectory, whereas there was no association among former or current-smokers. Total and non-aggressive PCA exhibited modest inverse associations with BMI at all ages, whereas no association was observed for aggressive PCA.  Conclusions:   Increased BMI was positively associated with fatal PCA, especially among never-smokers. Future studies that examine PCA survival will provide additional insight as to whether these associations are the result of biology or confounding.""","""['Scott P Kelly', 'Hannah Lennon', 'Matthew Sperrin', 'Charles Matthews', 'Neal D Freedman', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Michael F Leitzmann', 'Andrew G Renehan', 'Michael B Cook']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Epidemiol""","""['Prediagnostic Body Mass Index Trajectories in Relation to Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality in the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Body weight trajectories and risk of oesophageal and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas: a pooled analysis of NIH-AARP and PLCO Studies.', 'Body mass index and risk of lung cancer among never, former, and current smokers.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of tobacco use and prostate cancer mortality and incidence in prospective cohort studies.', 'Association between Alcohol Intake and Prostate Cancer Mortality and Survival.', 'Are associations between obesity and prostate cancer outcomes following radical prostatectomy the same in smokers and non-smokers?

Using real-world evidence (i.e., observational data), we aimed to further assess the difference in mortality between these two drug categories.  Material and methods:   We emulated a trial using data from Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden 3.0. We specifically focused on men diagnosed in 2006-2012 with high-risk PCa who had no distant metastasis. They either received primary hormonal therapy with AA (n = 2078) or GnRH agonists (n = 4878) who were followed for a median time of 5 years. Risk of death from PCa and other causes was assessed using competing risk analyses and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, including propensity score matching.  Results:   The cumulative 5-year PCa mortality was lower for men treated with AA (16% [95% confidence interval, CI, 15-18%]) than men treated with GnRH agonists (22% [95% CI 21-24%]). The 5-year other cause mortality was also lower for men on AA (17% [95% CI 15-19%] compared to men on GnRH agonists (27% [95% CI 25-28%]). In regression analyses, the risk of PCa death was similar, GnRH agonists versus AA (reference), hazard ratio (HR) 1.08 (95% CI 0.95-1.23), but the risk of death from all causes was higher for men on GnRH agonists, HR 1.23 (95% CI 1.13-1.34). Consistent results were seen in the propensity score-matched cohort.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that the use of AA as primary hormonal therapy in men with high-risk non-metastatic PCa does not increase PCa-specific mortality compared to GnRH. Using AA instead of GnRH agonists may result in shorter time on/exposure to GnRH-treatment, which may reduce the risk of adverse events associated with this treatment.""","""['Frederik Birkebæk Thomsen', 'Cecilia Bosco', 'Hans Garmo', 'Jan Adolfsson', 'Niklas Hammar', 'Pär Stattin', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Androgen Deprivation Therapies and Changes in Comorbidity: A Comparison of Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone Agonists and Antiandrogen Monotherapy as Primary Therapy in Men with High-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Association between duration and type of androgen deprivation therapy and risk of diabetes in men with prostate cancer.', 'Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Long-term adherence to GnRH agonists in men with prostate cancer.

During the screening of natural products to find STAT3 inhibitors, we identified 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA) as a STAT3 inhibitor, which was isolated from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia. In this study, we found that HCA inhibited constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation in STAT3-activated DU145 prostate cancer cells. HCA selectively inhibited the STAT3 activity by direct binding to STAT3, which was confirmed by biochemical methods, including a pull-down assay with biotin-conjugated HCA, a drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) experiment and a cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). HCA inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation at the tyrosine 705 residue, dimer formation, and nuclear translocation in DU145 cells, which led to a downregulation of STAT3 target genes. The downregulation of cell cycle progression and antiapoptosis-related gene expression by HCA induced the accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and then induced apoptosis. We also found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in the HCA-induced inhibition of STAT3 activation and cell proliferation because the suppressed p-STAT3 level was rescued by glutathione or N-acetyl-L-cysteine treatment, which are general ROS inhibitors. These results suggest that HCA could be a potent anticancer agent targeting STAT3-activated tumor cells.""","""['Yae Jin Yoon', 'Young-Hwan Kim', 'Yu-Jin Lee', 'Jiyeon Choi', 'Cheol-Hee Kim', 'Dong Cho Han', 'Byoung-Mog Kwon']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Acacetin Inhibits the Growth of STAT3-Activated DU145 Prostate Cancer Cells by Directly Binding to Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3).', '8-Epi-xanthatin induces the apoptosis of DU145 prostate carcinoma cells through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 inhibition and reactive oxygen species generation.', ""2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde inhibits cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth by targeting the pyruvate kinase M2."", 'Inhibiting STAT3 signaling pathway by natural products for cancer prevention and therapy: In vitro and in vivo activity and mechanisms of action.', 'STAT3 signaling in prostate cancer progression and therapy resistance: An oncogenic pathway with diverse functions.', ""STAT3 and Its Pathways' Dysregulation-Underestimated Role in Urological Tumors."", 'An update of label-free protein target identification methods for natural active products.', ""Regulation of ROS-Dependent JNK Pathway by 2'-Hydroxycinnamaldehyde Inducing Apoptosis in Human Promyelocytic HL-60 Leukemia Cells."", 'Acacetin Inhibits the Growth of STAT3-Activated DU145 Prostate Cancer Cells by Directly Binding to Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3).', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.']"""

Visualization of the bladder neck and urethra using transperineal ultrasound (US) may promote self-recognition of urethral closure during PFM contraction. This study aimed to examine whether transperineal US-guided PFMT promotes early recovery of post-RARP incontinence.  Methods:   This prospective cohort study included 116 men undergoing RARP. All men were offered to undergo transperineal US-guided PFMT, and 36 men agreed. The protocol consisted of biofeedback PFMT using transperineal US before RARP and 1-month after RARP with verbal instruction of PFMT immediately after urethral catheter removal. The remaining 80 patients received verbal instruction for PFMT alone. Continence recovery was defined as the number of days requiring a small pad (20 g) per day by self-report.  Results:   No differences were observed in demographic or peri-operative parameters between the two groups except the longer operative time in the US-guided PFMT group. The mean time until continence recovery was significantly shorter in the US-guided PFMT group (75.6 ± 100.0 days) than in the verbal-PFMT group (121.8 ± 132.0 days, P = 0.037).

Methods:   Initial data were acquired from patients with prostate cancer (N = 3) and high-grade brain tumors (N = 3) on a 3T scanner. Samples of [1-13 C]pyruvate were polarized for at least 2 h using a 5T SPINlab system operating at 0.8 K. Following injection of the HP substrate, pyruvate, lactate, and bicarbonate (for brain studies) were sequentially excited with a singleband spectral-spatial RF pulse and signal was rapidly encoded with a single-shot echo planar readout on a slice-by-slice basis. Data were acquired dynamically with a temporal resolution of 2 s for prostate studies and 3 s for brain studies.  Results:   High pyruvate signal was seen throughout the prostate and brain, with conversion to lactate being shown across studies, whereas bicarbonate production was also detected in the brain.

Here, we explored the effect of androgen receptor blockade (ARB) on PSMA expression visualized by PET and its potential additive effect when combined with 177Lu-PSMA RLT in a mouse model of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Mice bearing human CRPC (C4-2 cells) xenografts were treated with 10 mg/kg enzalutamide (ENZ), with 50 mg/kg bicalutamide (BIC), or vehicle (control) for 21 days. PSMA expression was evaluated by 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/CT and quantified by flow cytometry of tumor fine needle aspirations before treatment and on days 23, 29, 34, and 39 post-therapy induction. For the RLT combination approach, mice bearing C4-2 tumors were treated with 10 mg/kg ENZ or vehicle for 21 days before receiving either 15 MBq (84 GBq/μmol) 177Lu-PSMA617 or vehicle. DNA damage was assessed as phospho-γH2A.X foci in tumor biopsies. Reduction of tumor volume on CT and survival were used as study endpoints.  Results:   Tumor growth was delayed by ARB while 68Ga-PSMA11 uptake increased up to 2.3-fold over time when compared to controls. ABR-induced upregulation of PSMA expression was confirmed by flow cytometry. Phospho-γH2A.X levels increased 1.8- and 3.4-fold at 48 h in response to single treatment ENZ or RLT and ENZ+RLT, respectively. Despite significantly greater DNA damage and persistent increase of PSMA expression at the time of RLT, no additional tumor growth retardation was observed in the ENZ+RLT group (vs. RLT only, p = 0.372 at day 81). Median survival did not improve significantly when ENZ was combined with RLT.  Conclusion:   ARB-mediated increases in PSMA expression in PC xenografts were evident by 68Ga-PSMA11 PET imaging and flow cytometry. 177Lu-PSMA617 effectively decreased C4-2 tumor size.

There are 2 aims in bone management of prostate cancer:one is to prevent fragility fractures in patients without bone metastasis and the other is to prevent symptomatic skeletal events(SSE)which are pathologic fractures, spinal compression, radiation to bones and surgery to bones. Bone fractures and SSE are both correlated with worse overall survival(OS). Concomitant use of novel anti-androgens further increases the risk of falls and fractures. The earlier and appropiriate intervention with vitamin D and bone modifying agents(BMA)is necessary to prevent treatment related bone fractures and SSE. Bone management algorithm aids to decide the timing and doses of BMA. As for sarcopenia physical exercise and life style advices are important. Because abiraterone with glucocorticoid therapy induces stronger bone resorption, it is recommended to start denosumab simultaneously.

Methods:   Our virtual dose reconstruction method uses in air EPID measurements to calculate virtual 3D dose distributions within a CT data set. Patient errors are introduced by transforming the plan-CT into an error-CT data set. Virtual patient dose distributions reconstructed using the plan-CT and the error-CT data set are compared to the planned dose distributions by γ(3%/3 mm) and DVH analysis using seven indicators: ΔDISOC , γ-mean, near γ-max, γ-pass rate, ΔPTVD 2 , ΔPTVD 50, and ΔPTVD 98 . Translation and rotation patient setup errors and uniform contour changes are studied for 104 VMAT plans of 4 treatment sites. Lung expansions and contractions to simulate changes in lung density are considered for 26 IMRT lung plans. A ROC curve is generated for each combination of error and indicator. For each ROC curve, the AUC value and the optimal alert threshold value of the indicator are determined.  Results:   AUC values for γ-indicators and ΔPTVD 2 are consistently higher than for ΔDISOC and ΔPTVD 98 . For VMAT plans, error detectability to patient position shifts is worse for pelvic treatments and best for head-and-neck and brain plans. Excellent detectability is observed for 5 mm translations in head-and-neck plans (AUC = 0.94) and for 4° rotations in brain plans (AUC = 0.89). All sites but prostate show good-to-excellent detectability (AUC > 0.8) for 10 mm translations and 8° rotations and excellent detectability (AUC > 0.9) for ±6 mm patient contour changes. For head-and-neck, excellent detectability is obtained with γ-mean and γ-pass rate threshold values of around 0.63 and 83%, respectively. For brain and rectum, these threshold values are 0.53 and 90%, respectively. In IMRT lung plans, expansions of 3 mm and contractions of 6 mm are detected (AUC > 0.8).  Conclusions:   By combining virtual dose reconstructions with synthetic patient data, we developed a framework to assess the sensitivity of our 3D EPID transit dosimetry method to patient-related variations. The detectability of each introduced error is specific to the treatment site and indicator used. Optimal alert criteria can be determined to ensure excellent detectability for each combination of error type and indicator. The alert threshold values and the magnitude of the error that can be detected are site-specific. In situations where the minimum error that can be detected is larger than the clinically desirable action level, EPID transit dosimetry must be used in combination with IGRT procedures to ensure correct patient positioning and early detection of anatomy variations.""","""['Igor Olaciregui-Ruiz', 'Roel Rozendaal', 'Ben Mijnheer', 'Anton Mans']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['The effect of the choice of patient model on the performance of in vivo 3D EPID dosimetry to detect variations in patient position and anatomy.', 'Error detection during VMAT delivery using EPID-based 3D transit dosimetry.', 'In aqua vivo EPID dosimetry.', 'Clinical experience with EPID dosimetry for prostate IMRT pre-treatment dose verification.', 'A literature review of electronic portal imaging for radiotherapy dosimetry.', 'Extending in aqua portal dosimetry with dose inhomogeneity conversion maps for accurate patient dose reconstruction in external beam radiotherapy.', 'A recurrent neural network for rapid detection of delivery errors during real-time portal dosimetry.', 'Reduction of systematic dosimetric uncertainties in volumetric modulated arc therapy triggered by patient-specific quality assurance.', 'Augmented reality-guided positioning system for radiotherapy patients.', 'Evaluation of Daily CT for EPID-Based Transit In Vivo Dosimetry.']"""

Unfortunately, whilst the use of margins can increase the probability that sufficient dose is delivered to the CTV, it can also result in delivering high dose of radiation to surrounding organs at risk (OARs). We expand on our previous work on beam-dependent margins and propose a novel adaptive margin concept, where margins are moulded away from selected OARs for better OAR-high-dose sparing, whilst maintaining similar dose coverage probability to the CTV. This, however, comes at a cost of a larger irradiation volume, and thus can negatively impact other structures. We investigate the impact of the adaptive margin concept when applied to prostate radiotherapy treatments, and compare treatment plans generated using our beam-dependent margins without adaptation, with adaption from the rectum and with adaptation from both the rectum and bladder. Five prostate patients were used in this planning study. All plans achieved similar dose coverage probability, and were able to ensure at least 90% population coverage with the target receiving at least 95% of the prescribed dose to [Formula: see text].

Many studies have confirmed improvement in delivery efficiency by removing the FF, also known as flattening filter free (FFF), especially for small field stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT); but it is unclear if large treatment fields still favor the FFF beam. We propose a novel, unified approach to quantify delivery efficiency of the FFF and flattened beams.  Methods:   We modeled the FF effect by inverse conical filters and systematically studied delivery efficiency (beam-on time, BOT) by varying the filter thickness, including the FF and FFF mode. We formulated the BOT of different beams for any arbitrary fluence map in linear programming to solve the optimal inverse conical filter that minimizes the BOT. One-dimensional optimal filters of minimum BOT were also derived in closed form for conical fluence to gain insight for arbitrary clinical fluence maps. We evaluated the BOT of the FFF beam and flattened beam for conformal treatment fields of various dimensions ranging from 5 cm × 5 cm to 25 cm × 25 cm. We also analyzed the BOT for 698 clinical IMRT prostate fluence maps of field size 10 cm × 10 cm, 17 head-and-neck fluence maps of field size 15 cm × 15 cm, and additional realistic test data from 90° rotation and up to 40 cm × 40 cm enlargement of these clinical fluence maps, which were all initially generated with flattened beams.  Results:   The FFF beam minimized the BOT for A field size less than 20 cm in single leaf pair cases and for conformal fields of dimension less than 20 cm × 20 cm. The FFF beam also minimized the BOT for all tested prostate and head-and-neck cases. The median BOT ratios of the FFF beam to the flattened beam were 0.56 and 0.61 for prostate and head-and-neck cases, respectively. The FFF beam minimized the BOT for field size up to 30 cm × 30 cm and had similar BOTs to those of the flattened beam for field size greater than 30 cm × 30 cm in those clinically realistic test data.  Conclusion:   The filter modeling and BOT calculation enable us to quantify delivery efficiency of the FFF beam and flattened beam in a unified approach. The FFF beam minimized the BOT both theoretically and in simulations for all clinically relevant field sizes and fluence maps in IMRT. The results for conformal fields imply that the FFF beam requires less BOT than the flattened beam for volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatments. The delivery efficiency consideration favors the FFF beam in intensity-modulated treatments and may eventually lead to removal of the FF in all future linear accelerator head designs.""","""['Chaoqiong Ma', 'Mingli Chen', 'Troy Long', 'David Parsons', 'Xuejun Gu', 'Steve Jiang', 'Qing Hou', 'Weiguo Lu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['MO-A-BRB-02: Facts and Fiction of Flattening Filter Free (FF-FFF) X-Rays Beams.', 'Beam flatness modulation for a flattening filter free photon beam utilizing a novel direct leaf trajectory optimization model.', 'FFF-VMAT for SBRT of lung lesions: Improves dose coverage at tumor-lung interface compared to flattened beams.', 'Efficacy of flattening-filter-free beam in stereotactic body radiation therapy planning and treatment: A systematic review with meta-analysis.', 'Current status and future perspective of flattening filter free photon beams.', 'Planning issues on linac-based stereotactic radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric advantages of robust optimization combined with flattening filter free in treating cancer of the left breast.', 'Increased carcinoembryonic antigen expression on the surface of lung cancer cells using gold nanoparticles during radiotherapy.', 'Contrast Enhancement for Portal Imaging in Nanoparticle-Enhanced Radiotherapy: A Monte Carlo Phantom Evaluation Using Flattening-Filter-Free Photon Beams.']"""

The timewise association between the diagnosis of AF and a subsequent diagnosis of cancer may clarify whether a mutual cause exists, and may also guide clinicians about time windows of high risk of cancer occurrence. Methods and Results We conducted a population-based cohort study among 26 222 men and 28 879 women free of AF and cancer at baseline based on the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study. The participants were followed for the development of AF (the Danish National Patient Registry) and subsequent cancer (the Danish Cancer Registry) until 2013. We used Cox proportional hazard models with new-onset AF as time-dependent exposure. The men (median age 56 years) and women (median age 56 years) were followed for medians of 16.7 and 19.6 years, respectively. AF was associated with higher risks of any type of cancer (men: hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [ CI ], 1.26-1.58; women: HR 1.15, 95% CI , 1.02-1.32), and for men only, lung ( HR 1.66, 95% CI , 1.19-2.30), and colorectal cancer ( HR 1.37, 95% CI , 1.02-1.85). Within the initial 90 days following the diagnosis of AF , the risks of any type of cancer (men: HR 2.89, 95% CI , 2.10-3.98; women: HR 3.72, 95% CI , 2.49-5.56), lung (men: HR 7.70, 95% CI , 4.34-13.68; women: HR 7.98, 95% CI , 3.96-16.09), and colorectal cancer (men: HR 3.35, 95% CI , 1.03-10.90; women: HR 5.91, 95% CI , 2.44-14.29) were higher for men and women.

In three CML patients being monitored for urologic diseases, we observed that switching of TKI therapy affected prostate-specific antigen (PSA) titers. Urologists and other medical professionals need to be aware of the potential side-effects of drugs that patients may be receiving for other indications to modify this important prostate diseases indicator. TKIs may affect PSA titers independent of prostate growth or volume.  Materials and methods:   We followed PSA levels in urology patients who were also undergoing TKI treatment for CML. We determined the effects of nilotinib and imatinib on proliferation, AR and PSA expression in the LNCaP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines using real-time PCR and Western blotting.  Results:   Clinically, nilotinib and dasatinib reversibly reduced PSA titers compared to imatinib. At high doses nilotinib and imatinib both demonstrated antiproliferative effects in the PCa cells. At low doses expression of AR and PSA was decreased by both drugs, at mRNA and protein levels. Nilotinib exerted greater effects at lower doses than imatinib.  Conclusions:   Nilotinib down-regulates serum PSA in patients being treated for non-urological indications, potentially masking a clinical useful marker, we cannot exclude a similar but smaller effect of imatinib. Nilotinib and imatinib both decreased AR and PSA expression in PCa cell lines with the nilotinib effect evident at lower doses.

Our objective was to assess the concentration levels of sex steroids in prostatic tissue and serum, in two cohorts of patients with localized PCa or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Methods:   Between September 2014 and January 2017, men selected for radical cystectomy (for bladder cancer) or open prostatectomy (for BPH), and men selected for radical prostatectomy for localized PCa were included. Blood samples were collected at baseline before surgery, and steroid concentrations were assessed following the recommendations of the Endocrine Society. Intra-prostatic samples were collected from fresh surgical samples, and assessed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Permanova analysis was performed. Analyses were adjusted for age, prostate weight, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.  Results:   A total of 73 patients (41 patients with PCa and 32 patients with BPH) were included in this study. Patients with PCa were younger, and had smaller prostate volumes with higher levels of PSA. The levels of Total Testosterone (TT), Di-Hydro-Testosterone (DHT), and Estradiol (E2) in the serum were not significantly different between PCa and BPH. In PCa tissue, TT concentrations were significantly lower (0.11 ng/g vs 0.47 ng/g, P = 0.0002), however its derivative E2 had significantly higher concentrations (31.0 ng/g vs 22.3 ng/g, P = 0.01). DHT tissue concentrations were not significantly different between the two groups (5.55 ng/g vs 5.42 ng/g, P = 0.70). Intra-prostatic TT concentrations were significantly lower in the peripheral zone than in the central zone for the CaP group (0.07 ng/g vs 0.15 ng/g, P = 0.004).  Conclusions:   Patients with PCa had lower intra-prostatic TT and higher E2 concentrations levels compared to the patients with BPH.

Consistent with its more evident in vivo tumor suppressor role in prostate cancer, wild-type(wt)-ANXA7 in vitro induced similar G2-arrests, but reduced survival more drastically in prostate cancer cells compared to breast cancer cells (DU145 versus MDA-MB-231 and -435). In all three hormone-resistant cancer cell lines, wt-ANXA7 abolished the expression of the oncogenic low-molecular weight (LMW) cyclin E which was for the first time encountered in prostate cancer cells. Dominant-negative nMMM-ANXA7 (which lacks phosphatidylserine liposome aggregation properties) failed to abrogate LMW-cyclin E and simultaneously induced fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) in DU145 that was consistent with the continuing cell cycle progression and reduced cell death. Adenoviral vector alone induced FGF8 in MDA-MB-231/435 cell lines, but not in DU145 cells. Our data indicated that the LMW-Cyclin E expressions in breast cancer and prostate cancer cell-lines were differentially regulated by wild-type and dominant-negative ANXA7 isoforms, demonstrating a different survival mechanism utilized by breast cancer cells. Conventional tumor suppressor p53 failed to completely abolish FGF8 and LMW-cyclin E in breast cancer cells, which were eventually translated into their survival. Thus, ANXA7 tumor suppression could modulate FGF8 and cyclin E expression, and control implying more specific associations with the annexin properties of ANXA7 in prostate tumorigenesis.""","""['A Bera', 'X-M Leighton', 'H Pollard', 'M Srivastava']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Trends Cancer Res""","""['Annexin-A7 protects normal prostate cells and induces distinct patterns of RB-associated cytotoxicity in androgen-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Distinct effects of annexin A7 and p53 on arachidonate lipoxygenation in prostate cancer cells involve 5-lipoxygenase transcription.', 'ANXA7 expression represents hormone-relevant tumor suppression in different cancers.', 'ANXA7-GTPase as Tumor Suppressor: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Potential role of annexin A7 in cancers.', 'Exploring the Structural and Functional Diversity among FGF Signals: A Comparative Study of Human, Mouse, and Xenopus FGF Ligands in Embryonic Development and Cancer Pathogenesis.', 'AnnexinA7 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition by interacting with Sorcin and contributes to aggressiveness in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'FGF/FGFR signaling in health and disease.', 'Prognostic roles of miR-124-3p and its target ANXA7 and their effects on cell migration and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Downregulation of annexin A7 decreases proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells by reducing matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 9 expression.']"""

Magnetic resonance(MR)imaging is the method to detect skull-base metastases, which demonstrates focal lesions of low-intensity signal and enhancement on T1-weighted MR images.  Methods:   We reviewed clinical data and MR images from 127 patients with skull-base metastases diagnosed at Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital between August 2012 and November 2017.  Results:   The most common primary site was the lung(44 patients), followed by the breast(34), colon(8), and prostate(8). The interval from diagnosis of the primary tumor to skull-base metastasis ranged from 0 to 276 months(median, 9 months). The interval was shortest with lung cancer(median, 0 month), and longest with carcinoma of the liver(median, 81 months). The most commonly affected site was the clivus(74%), followed by the petrous(35%), and the occipital condyle(18%). We classified 55 symptomatic patients into 6 clinical syndromes: orbital(18%), parasellar(7%), middle cranial fossa(24%), jugular foramen(7%), and occipital condyle(15%), described by Greenberg, and a new entity ""clivopetrosal"" syndrome presenting diplopia due to abducens palsy(20%).

Methods:   3D high-resolution T2 -weighted images (0.9 × 0.9 × 3 mm3 ) were obtained with a multishot T2 -prepared balanced steady-state free precession (T2 -prep-bSSFP) acquisition sequence using a 3D variable density undersampled Cartesian trajectory. Each T2 -weighted image was reconstructed using total variation regularized sensitivity encoding. A flexible simulation framework based on extended phase graphs generated a dictionary of magnetization signals, which was customized to the proposed sequence. The dictionary was matched to the acquired T2 -weighted images to retrieve quantitative T2 values, which were then compared to gold-standard spin echo acquisition values using monoexponential fitting. The proposed approach was validated in simulations and a T1 /T2 phantom, and feasibility was tested in 8 healthy subjects.  Results:   The simulation analysis showed that the proposed T2 mapping approach is robust to noise and typically observed T1 variations. T2 values obtained in the phantom with T2 prep-bSSFP and the acquisition-specific, dictionary-based matching were highly correlated with the gold-standard spin echo method (r = 0.99).

Aberrant splicing isoforms and abnormal isoform ratios can contribute to cancer development. Kinase genes are key regulators of multiple cellular processes. Many kinases are found to be oncogenic and have been intensively investigated in the study of cancer and drugs. RNA-Seq provides a powerful technology for genome-wide study of alternative splicing in cancer besides the conventional gene expression profiling. But this potential has not been fully demonstrated yet.  Methods:   We characterized the transcriptome profile of prostate cancer using RNA-Seq data from viewpoints of both differential expression and differential splicing, with an emphasis on kinase genes and their splicing variations. We built a pipeline to conduct differential expression and differential splicing analysis, followed by functional enrichment analysis. We performed kinase domain analysis to identify the functionally important candidate kinase gene in prostate cancer, and calculated the expression levels of isoforms to explore the function of isoform switching of kinase genes in prostate cancer.  Results:   We identified distinct gene groups from differential expression and splicing analyses, which suggested that alternative splicing adds another level to gene expression regulation. Enriched GO terms of differentially expressed and spliced kinase genes were found to play different roles in regulation of cellular metabolism. Function analysis on differentially spliced kinase genes showed that differentially spliced exons of these genes are significantly enriched in protein kinase domains. Among them, we found that gene CDK5 has isoform switching between prostate cancer and benign tissues, which may affect cancer development by changing androgen receptor (AR) phosphorylation. The observation was validated in another RNA-Seq dataset of prostate cancer cell lines.  Conclusions:   Our work characterized the expression and splicing profiles of kinase genes in prostate cancer and proposed a hypothetical model on isoform switching of CDK5 and AR phosphorylation in prostate cancer. These findings bring new understanding to the role of alternatively spliced kinases in prostate cancer and also demonstrate the use of RNA-Seq data in studying alternative splicing in cancer.""","""['Huijuan Feng', 'Tingting Li', 'Xuegong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['RNA splicing and splicing regulator changes in prostate cancer pathology.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 acts as a critical determinant of AKT-dependent proliferation and regulates differential gene expression by the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 modulates STAT3 and androgen receptor activation through phosphorylation of Ser⁷²⁷ on STAT3 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Identifying differentially spliced genes from two groups of RNA-seq samples.', 'Targeting Splicing in Prostate Cancer.', 'EventPointer 3.0: flexible and accurate splicing analysis that includes studying the differential usage of protein-domains.', 'Characterization and clustering of kinase isoform expression in metastatic melanoma.', 'SRSF1-dependent inhibition of C9ORF72-repeat RNA nuclear export: genome-wide mechanisms for neuroprotection in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.', 'ISOGO: Functional annotation of protein-coding splice variants.']"""

Recently, we found that, in androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 cells, PGE2 acts through an intracrine mechanism by which its uptake by the prostaglandin transporter (PGT) results in increased intracellular PGE2 (iPGE2 ), leading to enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and loss of cell adhesion to collagen I. These iPGE2 -mediated effects were dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α), whose expression increased upon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation by a subset of intracellular PGE2 receptors. Here, we aimed to study the role of COX in PGE2 protumoral effects in PC3 cells and found that the effects were prevented by inhibition of COX-2, which highlights its crucial role amplifying the levels of iPGE2 . Treatment with exogenous PGE2 determined a transcriptional increase in COX-2 expression, which was abolished by genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of PGT. PGE2 -induced increase in COX-2 expression and, thereby, in transcriptional increase in HIF-1α expression was due to EGFR activation, leading to the activation of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, Extracellular signal -regulated kinases 1/2, p38 and Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (PI3K/Akt, Erk1/2, p38 and MSK-1). Collectively, the data suggest that EGFR-dependent COX-2 upregulation by a novel positive feedback loop triggered by iPGE2 underlies the intracrine pro-tumoral effects of PGE2 in PC3 cells. Therefore, this feedback loop may be relevant in prostate cancer for the maintenance of PGE2 -dependent cancer cell growth through amplifying the activity of the COX-2 pathway.""","""['Antonio Madrigal-Martínez', 'Vera Constâncio', 'Francisco J Lucio-Cazaña', 'Ana B Fernández-Martínez']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Intracellular EP2 prostanoid receptor promotes cancer-related phenotypes in PC3 cells.', 'Intracrine prostaglandin E2 pro-tumoral actions in prostate epithelial cells originate from non-canonical pathways.', 'Role of intracellular prostaglandin E₂ in cancer-related phenotypes in PC3 cells.', 'Inflammation in gastric cancer: Interplay of the COX-2/prostaglandin E2 and Toll-like receptor/MyD88 pathways.', 'Prostaglandin E2 as a potent therapeutic target for treatment of colon cancer.', 'Phloretin in Benign Prostate Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A Contemporary Systematic Review.', 'The Potential Tumor-Suppressor DHRS7 Inversely Correlates with EGFR Expression in Prostate Cancer Cells and Tumor Samples.', 'Leukotriene B4 receptor-2 contributes to KRAS-driven lung tumor formation by promoting interleukin-6-mediated inflammation.', 'Chemotherapy: a double-edged sword in cancer treatment.', 'Moringa oleifera Alkaloids Inhibited PC3 Cells Growth and Migration Through the COX-2 Mediated Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.']"""

ETS+ PCa express high levels of the androgen receptor (AR), yet PCa tumors lacking ETS fusions (ETS-) also express AR and demonstrate androgen-regulated growth. In this study, we evaluate the differences in the AR-regulated transcriptomes between ETS+ and ETS- PCa tumors.  Methods:   10,608 patient tumors from three independent PCa datasets classified as ETS+ (samples overexpressing ERG or other ETS family members) or ETS- (all other PCa) were analyzed for differential gene expression using false-discovery-rate adjusted methods and gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA).  Results:   Based on the expression of AR-dependent genes and an unsupervised Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model, AR-regulated gene expression alone was able to separate PCa samples into groups based on ETS status in all PCa databases. ETS status distinguished several differentially expressed genes in both TCGA (6.9%) and GRID (6.6%) databases, with 413 genes overlapping in both databases. Importantly, GSEA showed enrichment of distinct androgen-responsive genes in both ETS- and ETS+ tumors, and AR ChIP-seq data identified 131 direct AR-target genes that are regulated in an ETS-specific fashion. Notably, dysregulation of ETS-dependent AR-target genes within the metabolic and non-canonical WNT pathways was associated with clinical outcomes.

Patients and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2015), we identified men who underwent RP with pathologic T2 or T3a stage. Annual trends of PSM rates were plotted. Subgroups focused on geographic regions, namely the North Central, Northeast, South, and West. Cumulative incidence plots depicted other-cause mortality-adjusted CSM rates. Multivariable competing risks regression models tested the relationship between PSM and CSM. Subgroup analyses focused on pathologic stage, Gleason score, and geographic region.  Results:   Of 153,329 patients treated with RP, 12.3% (n = 18,935) exhibited PSM. Overall, in pathologic T2 stage and pathologic T3a stage, PSM rates decreased during the study period from 18.7% to 9.7% (P < .001), 15.7% to 7.3% (P < .001), and 39.0% to 18.0% (P < .001), respectively. In subgroup analyses focusing on geographic regions, PSM rates universally decreased. However, the magnitude differed. In multivariable competing risks regression models, PSM rates were associated with higher CSM (hazard ratio, 1.45; P < .001). However, geographic regions failed to reach independent predictor status. Insufficient information about PSM focality, length, and associated Gleason score represent important limitations.  Conclusion:   It is encouraging that PSM rates decreased during the study period, even after stratification according to tumor stage. PSM decreased within the 4 examined geographic regions. However, the rate of decrease varied in magnitude, but geographic regions did not represent an independent predictor of PSM.""","""['Felix Preisser', 'Elio Mazzone', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Sebastiano Nazzani', 'Marco Bandini', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Zhe Tian', 'Fred Saad', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Kevin C Zorn', 'Markus Graefen', 'Derya Tilki', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Effect of positive surgical margins at radical prostatectomy on cancer-specific mortality in high/very high-risk prostate cancer patients with Gleason Grade Group 4-5.', 'Primary Gleason grade 4 at the positive margin is associated with metastasis and death among patients with Gleason 7 prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'The importance of surgical margins in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Value of Gleason Score at Positive Surgical Margin in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Intravoxel incoherent motion predicts positive surgical margins and Gleason score upgrading after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Concordance between Preoperative mpMRI and Pathological Stage and Its Influence on Nerve-Sparing Surgery in Patients with High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Prediction of surgical margin status and location after radical prostatectomy using positive biopsy sites on 12-core standard prostate biopsy.', 'Practice Patterns of Korean Urologists Regarding Positive Surgical Margins after Radical Prostatectomy: a Survey and Narrative Review.', 'Predictive Factors for Positive Surgical Margins in Patients With Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Patients and methods:   Data of 843 diabetic men who underwent RP were stratified on the basis of preoperative use of no drug or of metformin, statin, or both. Multivariable Cox models were used to test the association between treatment and BCR. In a secondary analysis, models were stratified by race and body mass index (BMI) and further adjusted for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).  Results:   A total of 259 men (31%) received statin therapy, 94 (11%) metformin, 307 (36%) metformin + statin, and 183 (22%) neither. Five-year BCR-free survival rates were 75% in metformin only versus 75% in metformin + statin versus 60% in statin versus 68% in no drug groups (log-rank, P = .003). On multivariable analysis, preoperative statin use was associated with increased BCR risk versus men receiving neither drug (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.64). Metformin alone (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.53-1.47) and metformin + statin (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.58-1.33) were unrelated to BCR risks. In secondary analysis, the association between statin use and higher BCR risk was similar regardless of race, but was stronger among men with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (HR 3.12; 95% CI, 1.70-5.72). These results were largely unchanged after adjusting for HbA1c.  Conclusion:   Among diabetic men undergoing RP, preoperative statin use was associated with worse BCR risk, especially among men with a high BMI, but these associations may be mitigated by concomitant use of metformin. If validated in future findings, research is needed to understand the basis for these associations.""","""['Alireza Aminsharifi', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Christopher L Amling', 'William J Aronson', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Martha K Terris', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Postoperative statin use and risk of biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.', 'Synergism between metformin and statins in modifying the risk of biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy in men with diabetes.', 'Metformin does not affect risk of biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy: results from the SEARCH database.', 'Statins and prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Effect of Metformin and Statin Use on Survival in Pancreatic Cancer Patients: a Systematic Literature Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Individual and joint effects of metformin and statins on mortality among patients with high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Associations among statins, preventive care, and prostate cancer mortality.']"""

The Hippo pathway has been well established as a tumor suppressor pathway and is involved in many diverse biologic processes including cell growth, cell death, and organ size control in organisms. Here we showed that DHA induces cell growth inhibition and apoptosis of human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells dependent on the Hippo pathway. DHA inactivates YAP by promoting phosphorylation in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines, accompanied by increased YAP cytoplasm translocation. We also observed that DHA-induced YAP phosphorylation was reversed by both the LATS1 and MST1 siRNAs. Further experiments showed that the mechanism of DHA-induced YAP phosphorylation associated with FFAR1 and FFAR4. Down-regulation of FFAR1 and FFAR4 resulted in reduced YAP phosphorylation and reversed DHA-induced YAP phosphorylation. In addition, DHA-induced YAP phosphorylation was abolished by dominant negative Gαs and PKA inhibitor H-89. Overall, these findings define a mechanism by which FFAR1-and FFAR4-dependent activation of Hippo pathway mediates DHA-induced apoptosis of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, thus providing a promising therapeutic target for prostate cancer.""","""['Jingzhao Wang', 'Yuheng Hong', 'Shuai Shao', 'Kun Zhang', 'Wei Hong']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Wnt signaling promotes androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation through up-regulation of the hippo pathway effector YAP.', 'G-protein-coupled receptors mediate ω-3 PUFAs-inhibited colorectal cancer by activating the Hippo pathway.', 'Syndecan-1-dependent suppression of PDK1/Akt/bad signaling by docosahexaenoic acid induces apoptosis in prostate cancer.', 'The Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'YAP/TAZ for cancer therapy: opportunities and challenges (review).', 'The novel epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related proteins and their therapeutic targets in cholangiocarcinoma: a narrative review.', 'Lipid-Sensing Receptor FFAR4 Modulates Pulmonary Epithelial Homeostasis following Immunogenic Exposures Independently of the FFAR4 Ligand Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA).', 'Lipids as Targets for Renal Cell Carcinoma Therapy.', 'Candesartan Reduces Neuronal Apoptosis Caused by Ischemic Stroke via Regulating the FFAR1/ITGA4 Pathway.', 'Effect of taurine on the proliferation, apoptosis and MST1/Hippo signaling in prostate cancer cells.']"""
