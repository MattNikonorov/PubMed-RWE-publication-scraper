The role of miR-93 in human cancers is inconsistent and the underlying mechanism on the aberrant expression of miR-93 is complicated.  Methods:   We first conducted gene enrichment analysis to give insight into the prospective mechanism of miR-93. Second, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical value of miR-93. Finally, a validation test based on quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to further investigate the role of miR-93 in pan-cancer.  Results:   Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis results showed that the target genes of miR-93 were closely related to transcription, and MAPK1, RBBP7 and Smad7 became the hub genes. In the diagnostic meta-analysis, the overall sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were 0.76 (0.64-0.85), 0.82 (0.64-0.92), and 0.85 (0.82-0.88), respectively, which suggested that miR-93 had excellent performance on the diagnosis for human cancers. In the prognostic meta-analysis, dysregulated miR-93 was found to be associated with poor OS in cancer patients. In the qPCR validation test, the serum levels of miR-93 were upregulated in breast cancer, breast hyperplasia, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, nasopharyngeal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, gastric ulcer, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, and prostate cancer compared with healthy controls.  Conclusions:   miR-93 could act as an effective diagnostic and prognostic factor for cancer patients. Its clinical value for cancer early diagnosis and survival prediction is promising.""","""['Yun Gao', 'Kaifeng Deng', 'Xuexiang Liu', 'Meiyu Dai', 'Xiaoli Chen', 'Jifei Chen', 'Jianming Chen', 'Yujie Huang', 'Shengming Dai', 'Jingfan Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Clinical value screening, prognostic significance and key pathway identification of miR-204-5p in endometrial carcinoma: A study based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and bioinformatics analysis.', 'Clinical value of miR-182-5p in lung squamous cell carcinoma: a study combining data from TCGA, GEO, and RT-qPCR validation.', 'Clinical value of miR-198-5p in lung squamous cell carcinoma assessed using microarray and RT-qPCR.', 'Meta-analysis of microRNA-183 family expression in human cancer studies comparing cancer tissues with noncancerous tissues.', 'Integrative data mining and meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic role of microRNA-200 family in various human malignant neoplasms: A consideration on heterogeneity.', 'Shifting the Cancer Screening Paradigm: The Rising Potential of Blood-Based Multi-Cancer Early Detection Tests.', 'Construction of a serum diagnostic signature based on m5C-related miRNAs for cancer detection.', 'The Role and Interactions of Programmed Cell Death 4 and its Regulation by microRNA in Transformed Cells of the Gastrointestinal Tract.', 'Predictive and Prognostic Value of Non-Coding RNA in Breast Cancer.', 'mirTarRnaSeq: An R/Bioconductor Statistical Package for miRNA-mRNA Target Identification and Interaction Analysis.']"""

It is difficult to determine (1) when PCa disseminates in the natural history of the disease; (2) where cancer cell disseminates before becoming overt metastatic lesions; and (3) which tumors are aggressive and which are indolent. Tumor tissue and liquid (blood and bone marrow) biopsies provide important information to answer these questions, but significant limitations exist for immunostaining strategies that assess protein expression in these tissues. Classic immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays can typically assess expression of one or two proteins per tissue section. We have developed a novel immunofluorescence staining protocol to detect a panel of seven proteins on PCa tissue from primary tumor biopsies and metastatic lesion autopsy tissue, as well as cancer cells from liquid biopsies. We used a tyramide-based system to amplify the true signal and optimized the protocol to reduce background signal, thereby boosting the signal-to-noise ratio. Any protein-specific antibody in this protocol can be exchanged for a different validated antibody. This protocol therefore, represents a highly informative and flexible assay that can be used to provide important information about cancer tissue for the purpose of improving detection, diagnosis, and treatment.""","""['Sounak Roy', 'Haley D Axelrod', 'Kenneth C Valkenburg', 'Sarah Amend', 'Kenneth J Pienta']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Potential establishment of lung metastatic xenograft model of androgen receptor-positive and androgen-independent prostate cancer (C4-2B).', 'Applicability of biomarkers in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Global expression of AMACR transcripts predicts risk for prostate cancer - a systematic comparison of AMACR protein and mRNA expression in cancerous and noncancerous prostate.', 'The utility of PSMA and PSA immunohistochemistry in the cytologic diagnosis of metastatic prostate carcinoma.', 'The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of the prostate specific membrane antigen/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (PSMA/GCPII) in cancer and neurological disease.', 'Lineage plasticity enables low-ER luminal tumors to evolve and gain basal-like traits.', 'Phenotypic heterogeneity driven by plasticity of the intermediate EMT state governs disease progression and metastasis in breast cancer.', 'A Rapid Method for Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging of Frozen Tissue Sections.', 'A manual multiplex immunofluorescence method for investigating neurodegenerative diseases.', 'Procedural Requirements and Recommendations for Multiplex Immunofluorescence Tyramide Signal Amplification Assays to Support Translational Oncology Studies.']"""

As ghrelin stimulates prostate cancer proliferation, the ghrelin receptor antagonist [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 is a potential treatment for castrate-resistant prostate cancer and for preventing the metabolic consequences of androgen-targeted therapies. We therefore explored the effect of [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 on PC3 prostate cancer xenograft growth.  Methods:   NOD/SCID mice with PC3 prostate cancer xenografts were administered 20 nmoles/mouse [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 daily by intraperitoneal injection for 14 days and tumour volume and weight were measured. RNA sequencing of tumours was conducted to investigate expression changes following [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 treatment. A second experiment, extending treatment time to 18 days and including a higher dose of [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 (200 nmoles/mouse/day), was undertaken to ensure repeatability.  Results:   We demonstrate here that daily intraperitoneal injection of 20 nmoles/mouse [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 reduces PC3 prostate cancer xenograft tumour volume and weight in NOD/SCID mice at two weeks post treatment initiation. RNA-sequencing revealed reduced expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in these tumours. Further experiments demonstrated that the effects of [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 are transitory and lost after 18 days of treatment.  Conclusions:   We show that [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 has transitory effects on prostate xenograft tumours in mice, which rapidly develop an apparent resistance to the antagonist. Although further studies on [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 are warranted, we suggest that daily treatment with the antagonist is not a suitable treatment for advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Michelle L Maugham', 'Inge Seim', 'Patrick B Thomas', 'Gabrielle J Crisp', 'Esha T Shah', 'Adrian C Herington', 'Laura S Gregory', 'Colleen C Nelson', 'Penny L Jeffery', 'Lisa K Chopin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Endocrine""","""['Ghrelin receptor antagonism decreases alcohol consumption and activation of perioculomotor urocortin-containing neurons.', 'Long-term treatment with the ghrelin receptor antagonist d-Lys3-GHRP-6 does not improve glucose homeostasis in nonobese diabetic MKR mice.', 'D-Lys(3)-GHRP-6 antagonizes the effect of unacylated but not of acylated ghrelin on the growth of HECa10 murine endothelial cells.', 'The contractile effect of the ghrelin receptor antagonist, D-Lys3-GHRP-6, in rat fundic strips is mediated through 5-HT receptors.', 'Inhibitor of ghrelin receptor reverses gefitinib resistance in lung cancer.', 'Development of a ghrelin receptor inverse agonist for positron emission tomography.', 'Role of Calcium Signaling in Prostate Cancer Progression: Effects on Cancer Hallmarks and Bone Metastatic Mechanisms.', 'Attribution of Ghrelin to Cancer; Attempts to Unravel an Apparent Controversy.']"""

However, reports on toxicity and outcome have mainly focused on younger patients. We aimed to determine toxicity and biochemical control rates after combined HDR-BT and EBRT in men ≥75 years.  Methods:   From 1999 to 2015, 134 patients aged ≥75 years (median 76 years; 75-82 years) were identified. Patients received 18 Gy of HDR-BT (9 Gy/fraction on days 1 and 8) with an iridium-192 source. After 1 week, supplemental EBRT with a target dose of 50.4 Gy was started (delivered in 1.8 Gy fractions).  Results:   Median follow-up time was 25 months (0-127 months). No severe (grade 4) gastrointestinal (GIT) or genitourinary (GUT) toxicities were observed. In 76 patients (56.7%), 3D conformal radiation therapy (CRT) and in 34.3% intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was applied. CRT-treated patients were at a 2.17-times higher risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31-3.57, p = 0.002) of experiencing GUT. GIT risks could be reduced by 78% using IMRT (HR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.07-0.75, p = 0.015). Patients with a higher T stage (T2c-3a/b) were less likely to experience GIT or GUT (HR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.29-0.85, p = 0.011 and HR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.81, p = 0.005, respectively).  Conclusion:   HDR-BT/EBRT is a well-tolerated treatment option for elderly men ≥75 years with a limited number of comorbidities and localized intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer.

The application of PSMA-specific 18F-labeled PET probes such as 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007 considerably improved the accuracy of PCa tumor detection. However, there remains a need for further improvements in sensitivity and specificity. The aim of this study was the development of highly selective and specific PSMA probes with enhanced imaging properties, in comparison with 18F-DCFPyL, 18F-PSMA-1007, and 68Ga-PSMA-11. Methods: Eight novel 18F-labeled PSMA ligands were prepared. Their cellular uptake in PSMA-positive LNCaP C4-2 and PSMA-negative PC-3 cells was compared with that of 18F-DCFPyL. The most promising candidates were additionally evaluated by small-animal PET in healthy rats using PSMA-positive peripheral ganglia as a model for small PCa lesions. PET images of the ligand with the best outcome, 18F-JK-PSMA-7, were compared with those of 18F-DCFPyL, 18F-PSMA-1007, and 68Ga-PSMA-11 with respect to key image-quality parameters for the time frame 60-120 min. Results: Compared with 18F-DCFPyL, 18F-JK-PSMA-7 demonstrated increased PSMA-specific cellular uptake. Although target-to-background ratios of 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007 were comparable, this parameter was higher for 18F-JK-PSMA-7 and lower for 68Ga-PSMA-11. Image acutance was significantly higher for 18F-JK-PSMA-7 and 18F-PSMA-1007 than for 18F-DCFPyL and 68Ga-PSMA-11. Image resolution was similar for all 4 tracers. 18F-PSMA-1007 demonstrated significantly higher blood protein binding and bone uptake than the other tracers.

Our objective was to introduce 90Y-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 to clinical application, providing additional avenues for personalized medicine. Here, we present our dosimetry estimate for 90Y-PSMA-617, report first clinical experiences, and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of varying the β-emitter in PSMA-targeting radioligand therapy. Methods: To approximate radiation dosimetry, 4 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer underwent serially performed imaging up to 1 wk after 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. Time-activity curves were extrapolated to the half-life of 90Y, and OLINDA was used to calculate the dosimetry estimate. In clinical practice, 11 patients with PSMA-positive lymph-nodal bulk disease were stratified to receive 90Y-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (mean, 3.2 GBq; range, 2.8-3.7 GBq); afterward, safety lab tests, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, and clinical findings were thoroughly followed. Results: The projected dosimetry for 90Y-PSMA-617 estimated a mean kidney dose of 3.47 ± 1.40 Gy/GBq, red marrow dose of 0.11 ± 0.04 Gy/GBq, and salivary gland dose of 5.57 ± 1.34 Gy/GBq; randomly chosen metastases were approximated with 22.8 ± 16.10 Gy/GBq. The observed acute hematologic toxicity (5 cases of leukopenia and 2 of thrombocytopenia, all grade 1 or 2) and clinical side effects (2 cases of transient xerostomia and 1 of nausea, all grade 1 or 2), as well as PSA response (any PSA response, 7/11 patients; >50% PSA decline, 5/11 patients), were comparable to 177Lu-PSMA-617 literature data. Conclusion: A factor 3-4 lower treatment activity for 90Y-PSMA-617 translates into a comparable dosimetry estimate and clinical findings similar to those of 177Lu-PSMA-617.

However, PCA3 urine tests have some limitations. Therefore, we developed a colorimetric method for PCA3 detection in urine.  Methods:   The assay was based on interactions between unmodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and thiolated PCR products. Thiolated PCR products were amplified by RT-PCR using a thiol-labeled primer at the 5' end. Thiolated products of PCA3 bound to the surface of AuNPs and led to the prevention of salt-induced aggregation (red color). In the absence of the PCR products, AuNPs changed their color from red to blue due to the salt-induced aggregation. These changes were detected by the naked eye and spectrophotometer.  Results:   Our assay was specific for PCA3 in prostate cancer cell lines with a visual detection limit of 31.25 ng/reaction. The absorption ratio 520/640 nm was linear against PCR product concentration (R2 = 0.9798) in the reaction.

Patients and methods:   Patients were identified from a provincial cancer registry and a genitourinary cancer outcomes unit (2005-2014). Of a total of 4723 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, 167 patients with pN+ P-Ca were identified (28/2181 from 2005-2007 and 139/2542 from 2010-2014). Persistently elevated postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥ 0.2 ng/ml was noted in 52 (31%) patients, 23 (44.2%) of whom had salvage androgen deprivation therapy plus radiotherapy (ADT + RT), 25 (48%) were managed with ADT alone and four (7.8%) had no treatment. Of 115 patients with postoperative PSA <0.2 ng/ml, 47 (41%) had ADT alone and 50 (43.5%) had ADT + RT. Survival estimation was carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method. The association of prognostic factors with survival was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis and was limited to the newer cohort (2010-2014).  Results:   The median age was 64 years; the median baseline PSA was 12.5 ng/mL (range 2.5-108.4). After a median follow-up of 48 months, overall survival at 5 and 10 years for the entire cohort were 89% and 81%, respectively, and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) at the same time points were 77% and 58%, respectively. For the newer cohort, 5-year overall survival and DMFS were 91.5% and 76%, respectively. On univariate analysis, persistently elevated postoperative PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml (P = 0.0003), seminal vesicle involvement (P = 0.027), ≥2 nodes (P = 0.035) and ADT alone (P = 0.054) had a poor prognostic impact on DMFS, whereas margin involvement had a marginally negative influence on overall survival (P = 0.06). On multivariate analysis, postoperative PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml (hazard ratio 4.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-11.4; P = 0.002) continued to have a significant association with DMFS. On a sensitivity analysis, postoperative PSA ≥0.1 also had a significant association with DMFS on univariate and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 3.69, 95% confidence interval 1.32-10.29; P = 0.01). Similarly, postoperative PSA ≥0.4 ng/ml had a significant association with DMFS (hazard ratio 3.87, 95% confidence interval 1.58-9.46, P = 0.003).

We investigated 10-year PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall mortality (OM) in high-risk patients treated with HDR-BT/EBRT (calculated EQD2 = 102 Gy) compared to EBRT alone (70 Gy).  Methods:   HDR-BT boosts (10 Gy × 2) were given 2 weeks apart followed by 50 Gy conformal EBRT (2 Gy × 25) to the prostate and seminal vesicles. The HDR-BT/EBRT group (N:325) received Androgen Deprivation Therapy for a median duration of 2 years. The historical control group (N:296), received a median dose of 70 Gy (2 Gy × 35) to the prostate and seminal vesicles with lifelong Anti-Androgen Treatment. For each treatment group PCSM and OM were established by competing-risk analyses and Kaplan-Meier analyses respectively. Differences were evaluated by the logrank test. Independent associations were established by Cox regression analyses. Significance level set to p < 0.05.  Results:   Median follow-up was 104 and 120 months for the HDR-BT/EBRT and the EBRT group respectively. A 3.6-fold decreased risk of PCSM (p < 0.01) and a 1.6-fold decreased risk of OM (p = 0.02) in the HDR-BT/EBRT cohort compared to the EBRT-only group were revealed. Ten-year OM and PCSM rates were 16% and 2.5% in the HDR-BT/EBRT group versus 23% and 8.2% in the EBRT-only group respectively. Both treatment modality (HR = 3.59, 95%CI 1.50-8.59) and Gleason score (HR = 2.48, 95%CI 1.18-5.21) were associated with PCSM. Only treatment modality (HR = 1.63, 95%CI = 1.08-2.44) was significantly associated with OM.  Conclusions:   Men with high-risk PCa have a significantly reduced PCSM and OM rates when treated with dose-escalated radiotherapy achieved by HDR-BT/EBRT compared to EBRT alone (70 Gy). A Gleason score of 8-10 was independently associated with increased risk of PCSM. Randomized studies are warranted.  Summary:   Observational study of 10-year survival in high-risk Prostate Cancer (PCa) after High-Dose-Rate brachytherapy combined with External Beam Radiation Therapy (HDR-BT/EBRT) compared to EBRT alone. The combined HDR-BT/EBRT treatment was found to give a 3.6-fold decrease in Prostate Cancer Specific Mortality (PCSM) and a 1.6-fold decrease in Overall Mortality (OM). Gleason score and type of treatment strongly influenced PCSM whereas only treatment modality was associated with OM. The observed benefits of dose-escalation warrant future randomized trials.""","""['Trude B Wedde', 'Milada C Småstuen', 'Sigmund Brabrand', 'Sophie D Fosså', 'Stein Kaasa', 'Gunnar Tafjord', 'Kjell M Russnes', 'Taran P Hellebust', 'Wolfgang Lilleby']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['The addition of low-dose-rate brachytherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy decreases biochemical failure and prostate cancer death compared with dose-escalated external-beam radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy With a Brachytherapy Boost Versus Radical Prostatectomy in Gleason Pattern 5 Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Radical Prostatectomy, External Beam Radiotherapy, or External Beam Radiotherapy With Brachytherapy Boost and Disease Progression and Mortality in Patients With Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Combination of brachytherapy and external beam radiation for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical factors affecting the long-term survival of breast cancer patients.', 'Late Adverse Health Outcomes and Quality of Life after curative radiotherapy\xa0+\xa0long-term ADT in Prostate Cancer Survivors: Comparison with men from the general population.', 'Role of Brachytherapy Boost in Clinically Localized Intermediate and High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Lack of Benefit in Patients with Very High-Risk Factors T3b-4 and/or Gleason 9-10.', 'Propensity score-matched analysis comparing dose-escalated intensity-modulated radiation therapy versus external beam radiation therapy plus high-dose-rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Conventional dose versus dose escalated radiotherapy including high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost for patients with Gleason score 9-10 clinical localized prostate cancer.']"""

One unintended consequence of the MMA may be an increase in the racial disparities in receipt of ADT. Given these policy changes, it becomes increasingly important to assess racial disparities in timely receipt of ADT.  Methods:   The purpose of this study is to evaluate the associations between race and median time to receipt of ADT among men with metastatic prostate cancer before and after the passage of the MMA. A population-based retrospective cohort was created from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare.  Results:   A total of 1,846 African-American and 9,462 Caucasian men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer from 2000 through 2011 were included. An accelerated failure time regression model was used to examine factors associated with racial differences in median time to receipt of ADT. Results indicate that African-American men had a longer median time to receipt of ADT both before the MMA (Time Ratio (TR): 1.15; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [1.05, 1.27]) and after the MMA (TR: 1.29; 95% CI [1.10, 1.53]) as compared to Caucasian men. In addition to race, men residing in South had longer median time to receipt of ADT (TR: 1.26, 1.52; 95% CI [1.01, 1.52; 1.24, 1.87] before and after MMA, respectively) compared to the Northeast region.

Methods:   From a large healthcare database, patients aged 21-89 years, diagnosed with diabetes before January 2002 (prevalent) or during 2002-2010 (incident), were followed for cancer during 2004-2012 (excluding cancers diagnosed within the first 2 years since diabetes diagnosis). Risks of selected cancers (all-sites, colon, breast, lung, prostate, pancreas and liver) were estimated according to glycemic-control in a Cox regression model with time-dependent covariates, adjusted for age, sex, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status, smoking and parity. Missing glucose or HbA1c values were imputed.  Results:   Among 440,000 patients included in our analysis, cancer was detected more than 2 years after diabetes diagnosis in 26,887 patients (6%) during the follow-up period. Associations of poor glycemic-control with all-sites cancer and most specific cancers were either null or only weak (hazard ratios (HRs) for a 1% HbA1c or a 30 mg/dl glucose increase between 0.94 and 1.09). Exceptions were pancreatic cancer, for which there was a strong positive association (HRs: 1.26-1.51), and prostate cancer, for which there was a moderate negative association (HRs: 0.85-0.96).  Conclusion:   Overall, poor glycemic-control appears to be only weakly associated with cancer-risk, if at all. A substantial part of the positive association with pancreatic cancer is attributable to reverse causation, with the cancer causing poorer glycemic-control prior to its diagnosis. The negative association with prostate cancer may be related to lower PSA levels in those with poor control.""","""['R Dankner', 'L Keinan Boker', 'P Boffetta', 'R D Balicer', 'H Murad', 'A Berlin', 'L Olmer', 'N Agai', 'L S Freedman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Glycemic Control and the Risk of Tuberculosis: A Cohort Study.', 'Diabetes, prostate cancer screening and risk of low- and high-grade prostate cancer: an 11\xa0year historical population follow-up study of more than 1 million men.', 'Metabolic memory: Evolving concepts.', 'Correlates of poor glycemic control among patients with diabetes initiating hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease.', 'Report of the Japan Diabetes Society (JDS)/Japanese Cancer Association (JCA) Joint Committee on Diabetes and Cancer, Second Report.', 'Potential preventive properties of GLP-1 receptor agonists against prostate cancer: a nationwide cohort study.', 'High glucose-upregulated PD-L1 expression through RAS signaling-driven downregulation of PTRH1 leads to suppression of T cell cytotoxic function in tumor environment.', 'The crosstalk within the breast tumor microenvironment in type II diabetes: Implications for cancer disparities.', 'Association between diabetes, obesity, aging, and cancer: review of recent literature.', 'Metformin Treatment Among Men With Diabetes and the Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Historical Cohort Study.']"""

Patients and methods:   Fifty-eight hormone-naive men with advanced prostate cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) to either subcapsular orchiectomy or triptorelin 22.5 mg/24 week depot injections. The participants were followed for 48 weeks, with study visits at baseline, 12, 24 and 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was changes in fasting plasma glucose. Secondary endpoints included changes in body composition (i.e. weight, fat mass, visceral adipose tissue [VAT], subcutaneous adipose tissue [SAT], lean body mass [LBM] and android/gynoid fat [AG] ratio) assessed with dual X-ray absorptiometry, serum lipid profiles, and insulin resistance evaluated during an oral glucose tolerance test. Linear mixed models were used to analyse the between-group differences.  Results:   No treatment differences in the changes in fasting plasma glucose (0.2 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.1, 0.4; P = 0.32) were observed. The orchiectomy group experienced greater increases in total fat mass (+2.06 kg, 95% CI 0.55, 3.56), SAT (+133 cm3 , 95% CI 22, 243) and weight (+3.30 kg, 95% CI 0.74, 5.87) at 48 weeks than did the triptorelin group (all P < 0.05), with the increases in fat mass being moderately correlated with increases in insulin resistance (P < 0.001). No differences in changed VAT, LBM or AG ratio were observed between the groups. The pooled analyses, combining data from both groups, showed androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to significantly increase fat mass, SAT, VAT, serum cholesterols (total, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein) and all measures of insulin resistance over time, while LBM decreased as compared with baseline values (all P < 0.05). These changes were apparent after only 12-24 weeks of ADT.  Conclusions:   Androgen deprivation therapy leads to adverse changes in body composition and increased insulin resistance and serum cholesterols, with changes already observed after only 12-24 weeks of treatment. This study further demonstrates that orchiectomy causes greater increases in fat accumulation compared with GnRH agonists and that these increases are associated with an increase in insulin resistance.""","""['Peter B Østergren', 'Caroline Kistorp', 'Mikkel Fode', 'Finn N Bennedbaek', 'Jens Faber', 'Jens Sønksen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone Agonists are Superior to Subcapsular Orchiectomy in Lowering Testosterone Levels of Men with Prostate Cancer: Results from a Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'GnRH antagonist associates with less adiposity and reduced characteristics of metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis compared with orchiectomy and GnRH agonist in a preclinical mouse model.', 'Football training improves lean body mass in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'An Update on Triptorelin: Current Thinking on Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Long-term and sequential treatment for osteoporosis.', 'Tolerability of concurrent external beam radiotherapy and 177LuLu-PSMA-617 for node-positive prostate cancer in treatment naïve patients, phase I study (PROQURE-I trial).', 'Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists versus orchiectomy in the treatment of prostate cancer: A systematic review.', 'FSH-blocking therapeutic for osteoporosis.', 'Quality of life in low-income men after surgical castration for metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Therefore, it is crucial to be able to identify a relatively small number of methylation sites that provide high precision and sensitivity for the diagnosis of pathological states. We propose an algorithm for constructing limited subsamples from high-dimensional data to form diagnostic panels. We have developed a tool that utilizes different methods of selection to find an optimal, minimum necessary combination of factors using cross-entropy loss metrics (LogLoss) to identify a subset of methylation sites. We show that the algorithm can work effectively with different genome methylation patterns using ensemble-based machine learning methods. Algorithm efficiency, precision and robustness were evaluated using five genome-wide DNA methylation datasets (totaling 626 samples), and each dataset was classified into tumor and non-tumor samples. The algorithm produced an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-0.99, 9 sites) for prostate adenocarcinoma and an AUC of 1.0 (from 2 to 6 sites) for urothelial bladder carcinoma, two types of kidney carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma. For prostate adenocarcinoma we showed that identified differential variability methylation patterns distinguish cluster of samples with higher recurrence rate (hazard ratio for recurrence = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.05-0.92; log-rank test, p-value < 0.03). We also identified several clusters of correlated interchangeable methylation sites that can be used for the elaboration of biological interpretation of the resulting models and for further selection of the sites most suitable for designing diagnostic panels.

Herein, we report on prostate-specific results from CLARITY-BPA (Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity), which aims to resolve uncertainties regarding BPA toxicity.  Objectives:   We sought to a) reassess whether a range of BPA exposures drives prostate pathology and/or alters prostatic susceptibility to hormonal carcinogenesis, and b) test whether chronic low-dose BPA targets prostate epithelial stem and progenitor cells.  Methods:   Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged daily with vehicle, ethinyl estradiol (EE) or [Formula: see text] BPA/kg-BW during development or chronically, and prostate pathology was assessed at one year. One developmentally exposed cohort was given testosterone plus estradiol ([Formula: see text]) implants at day 90 to promote carcinogenesis with aging. Epithelial stem and progenitor cells were isolated by prostasphere (PS) culture from dorsolateral prostates (DLP) of rats continuously exposed for six months to [Formula: see text] BPA/kg-BW. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).  Results:   Exposure to BPA alone at any dose did not drive prostate pathology. However, rats treated with EE, 2.5, 250, or [Formula: see text] BPA/kg-BW plus [Formula: see text] showed greater severity of lateral prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and DLP ductal adenocarcinoma multiplicity was markedly elevated in tumor-bearing rats exposed to [Formula: see text]-BW. DLP stem cells, assessed by PS number, doubled with chronic EE and [Formula: see text] exposures. PS size, reflecting progenitor cell proliferation, was greater at 25 and [Formula: see text] BPA doses, which also shifted lineage commitment toward basal progenitors while reducing luminal progenitor cells.  Conclusions:   Together, these results confirm and extend previous evidence using a rat model and human prostate epithelial cells that low-dose BPA augments prostate cancer susceptibility and alters adult prostate stem cell homeostasis. Therefore, we propose that BPA exposures may contribute to the increased carcinogenic risk in humans that occurs with aging. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3953.""","""['Gail S Prins', 'Wen-Yang Hu', 'Lishi Xie', 'Guang-Bin Shi', 'Dan-Ping Hu', 'Lynn Birch', 'Maarten C Bosland']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Environ Health Perspect""","""['Prostate Cancer Risk and DNA Methylation Signatures in Aging Rats following Developmental BPA Exposure: A Dose-Response Analysis.', 'Bisphenol A promotes human prostate stem-progenitor cell self-renewal and increases in vivo carcinogenesis in human prostate epithelium.', 'Bisphenol A Disrupts HNF4α-Regulated Gene Networks Linking to Prostate Preneoplasia and Immune Disruption in Noble Rats.', 'CLARITY-BPA academic laboratory studies identify consistent low-dose Bisphenol A effects on multiple organ systems.', ""Flaws in design, execution and interpretation limit CLARITY-BPA's value for risk assessments of bisphenol A."", 'Re-evaluation of the risks to public health related to the presence of bisphenol A (BPA) in foodstuffs.', 'Effects of perinatal exposure to bisphenol A on induction of prostate cancer in Sprague Dawley rats by MNU and testosterone.', 'Individual and Combined Effect of Bisphenol A and Bisphenol AF on Prostate Cell Proliferation through NF-κB Signaling Pathway.', 'Characterization of the Molecular Alterations Induced by the Prolonged Exposure of Normal Colon Mucosa and Colon Cancer Cells to Low-Dose Bisphenol A.', 'Environmental Phenol and Paraben Exposure Risks and Their Potential Influence on the Gene Expression Involved in the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2016. Diagnostic accuracy was quantitatively pooled for all studies by using hierarchical logistic regression modeling, including bivariate modeling and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves (AUCs). The Z test was used to determine whether adding functional MRI to T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) results in significantly increased diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.  Results:   Meta-analysis of 13 studies involving 826 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 91%, and the AUC was 0.96. Meta-analysis of 7 studies involving 329 patients who underwent radiotherapy showed a pooled sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 81%, and the AUC was 0.88. Meta-analysis of 11 studies reporting 1669 sextant biopsies from patients who underwent radiotherapy showed a pooled sensitivity of 54% and specificity of 91%, and the AUC was 0.85. Sensitivity after radiotherapy was significantly higher when diffusion-weighted MRI data were combined with T2WI than when only T2WI results were used. This was true when meta-analysis was performed on a per-patient basis (p = 0.027) or per sextant biopsy (p = 0.046). A similar result was found when 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) data were combined with T2WI and sextant biopsy was the unit of analysis (p = 0.036).

Established methods rely on γ emitting tracers coupled with γ detecting probes. The efficacy of this technique is however hindered by the high penetration of γ radiation, limiting its applicability to low background conditions. To overtake such limitations, a novel approach to RGS has been proposed, relying on β- emitting isotopes together with a dedicated β probe. This technique has been proved to be effective in first ex-vivo trials.

Its protein product, a mitotic kinesin, accelerates growth of normal mammary epithelial cells in vitro and retinoblastoma tumours in a mouse model, while KIF14 knockdown blocks growth of brain, liver, ovarian, breast, prostate, and other tumour cells and xenografts. However, the tumour-initiating effects of Kif14 overexpression have not been studied. We aged a cohort of Kif14-overexpressing transgenic mice and wild-type littermates and documented survival, cause of death, and tumour burden. The Kif14 transgene was expressed in all tissues examined, and was associated with increased proliferation marker expression. Neither mouse weights nor overall survival differed between genotypes. However, Kif14 transgenic mice showed a higher incidence of fatal lymphomas (73 vs. 50%, p = 0.03, Fisher's exact test), primarily follicular and diffuse B-cell lymphomas. Non-tumour findings included a bilateral ballooning degeneration of lens in 12% of Kif14 transgenic mice but no wild-type mice (p = 0.02).

However, little is known about the effect surgical duration has on complications. We assess the relationship between operative time and TURP complications using a modern national surgical registry.  Methods:   We queried the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) from 2006 to 2016 for patients undergoing TURP. Patients were separated into five groups based on operative time: 0-30 min, 30.1-60 min, 60.1-90 min, 90.1-120 min, and greater than 120 min. Standard statistical analysis, including multivariate regression, was performed to determine factors associated with complications.  Results:   31,813 patients who underwent TURP were included. The overall complication rate was 9.0% and increased significantly with longer surgical duration (p < 0.001). Longer operative time was associated with a greater risk of postoperative sepsis or shock, transfusion, reoperation, and deep vein thrombus or pulmonary embolism. Longer surgical duration was associated with increased odds of any complication and, specifically, blood transfusion after controlling for age, race, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) class, type of anesthesia administered, and trainee involvement. The adjusted risk of each of the above complications remained significantly increased for surgeries lasting longer than 120 min.

Methods:   CfDNA from 663 plasma samples from 140 patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) was subject to sparse whole genome sequencing. Tumor fraction (TFx) estimated using the computational tool ichorCNA was correlated with clinical features and responses to therapy.

Given heterogeneity and multifocality of primary prostate cancer, such assays should ideally be robust to the coexistence of unsampled higher grade disease elsewhere in the prostate in order to have clinical utility. Herein, we comprehensively evaluated transcriptomic profiles of primary multifocal prostate cancer to assess robustness to clinically relevant multifocality.  Methods:   We designed a comprehensive, multiplexed targeted RNA-sequencing assay capable of assessing multiple transcriptional classes and deriving commercially available prognostic signatures, including the Myriad Prolaris Cell Cycle Progression score, the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score, and the GenomeDX Decipher Genomic Classifier. We applied this assay to a retrospective, multi-institutional cohort of 156 prostate cancer samples. Derived commercial biomarker scores for 120 informative primary prostate cancer samples from 44 cases were determined and compared.  Results:   Derived expression scores were positively correlated with tumor grade (rS = 0.53-0.73; all P < 0.001), both within the same case and across the entire cohort. In cases of extreme grade-discordant multifocality (co-occurrence of grade group 1 [GG1] and ≥GG4 foci], gene expression scores were significantly lower in low- (GG1) versus high-grade (≥GG4) foci (all P < 0.001). No significant differences in expression scores, however, were observed between GG1 foci from prostates with and without coexisting higher grade cancer (all P > 0.05).  Conclusions:   Multifocal, low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer foci exhibit distinct prognostic expression signatures. These findings demonstrate that prognostic RNA expression assays performed on low-grade prostate cancer biopsy tissue may not provide meaningful information on the presence of coexisting unsampled aggressive disease.

He underwent a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for pT2aNx adenocarcinoma with negative margins. In 2008, he was found to have muscle-invasive high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma and underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy and ileal conduit for pT2bN0 urothelial carcinoma.

A robot-assisted lysis of adhesions and placement of a tissue expander in the prostatic fossa was performed. Three robotic ports and 1 assistant port were utilized. The sigmoid and small bowel were displaced during lysis of adhesions. The deflated tissue expander was inserted through the midline trocar site, inflated intra-abdominally, and filled with 330 cc of saline. The tissue expander was secured with proline sutures in a dependent position. The patient subsequently underwent Intensity-modulated radiation therapy of 66 Gy to the prostatic fossa. Eleven days after finishing intensity-modulated radiation therapy, he underwent successful laparoscopic removal of the tissue expander. PSA nadir was <0.02 ng/mL.

Cell viability assay, Edu assay, neurosphere formation assay and xenograft experiments were used to detect the proliferative ability. Western blot, Elisa and luciferase reporter assays were used to detect the possible mechanism.  Findings:   Our study firstly found that PSAP was highly expressed and secreted in clinical glioma specimens, glioma stem cells, and glioma cell lines. It was associated with poor prognosis. We found that PSAP significantly promoted the proliferation of glioma stem cells and cell lines. Moreover, PSAP promoted tumorigenesis in subcutaneous and orthotopic models of this disease. Furthermore, GSEA and KEGG analysis predicted that PSAP acts through the TLR4 and NF-κB signaling pathways, which was confirmed by western blot, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and use of the TLR4-specific inhibitor TAK-242.  Interpretation:   The findings of this study suggest that PSAP can promote glioma cell proliferation via the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and may be an important target for glioma treatment.

AKAP12 expression is known to be suppressed in several human malignancies including breast, prostate, gastric and colon cancers. In this study, we evaluated the role of AKAP12 in the migration of breast cancer cells, an important cellular process in cancer progression. AKAP12 gene expression was analyzed in human breast cancer tissues using the Gene expression-based Outcome for Breast cancer Online (GOBO) database and TissueScan array, followed by relapse free survival (RFS) analysis with the Kaplan-Meier Plotter. AKAP12 protein was then analyzed in normal MCF10A breast cell line and six different breast cancer cell lines (AU565, Hs578T, MCF7, MDA-MB-231, T47D and ZR751). After which, siRNA-mediated knockdown of AKAP12 was carried out in MCF10A, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells, followed by phenotypic assays. AKAP12 was observed to be reduced in breast cancer tissues as analyzed by GOBO and TissueScan array. Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with AKAP12 gene expression had a higher RFS survival. There was also decreased AKAP12 protein expression in breast cancer cell lines compared to MCF10A normal epithelial breast cell line. Knockdown of AKAP12 in both MCF10A cells and Hs578T cells induced cell migration but did not alter cell proliferation. Moreover, siAKAP12 in aggressive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells led to an increase in cell migration. Immunofluorescence analysis of AKAP12 depleted MCF10A cells also revealed formation of thick stress fibers which could affect cell migration. Hence, the findings in this study suggest that AKAP12 is a potential metastasis suppressor in breast cancer.""","""['Regina You Zhen Soh', 'Jia Pei Lim', 'Ramar Perumal Samy', 'Pei Jou Chua', 'Boon Huat Bay']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['Inhibition of endothelial cell migration through the down‑regulation of MMP-9 by A-kinase anchoring protein 12.', 'Re-expression of AKAP12 inhibits progression and metastasis potential of colorectal carcinoma in vivo and in vitro.', 'Upregulation of AKAP12 with HDAC3 depletion suppresses the progression and migration of colorectal cancer.', 'Suppression of tumor and metastasis progression through the scaffolding functions of SSeCKS/Gravin/AKAP12.', 'The Mechanism and Influence of AKAP12 in Different Cancers.', 'Methylation factors as biomarkers of fibromyalgia.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of the Immune Implication of AKAP12 in Stomach Adenocarcinoma.', 'Pan-cancer analysis of the prognosis and immunological role of AKAP12: A potential biomarker for resistance to anti-VEGF inhibitors.', 'The short inverted repeats-induced circEXOC6B inhibits prostate cancer metastasis by enhancing the binding of RBMS1 and HuR.', 'AKAP12 ameliorates liver injury via targeting PI3K/AKT/PCSK6 pathway.']"""

Our aim was to analyse the potential benefit of this radiotracer in the biochemical relapse of prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   This retrospective analysis included 53 studies, performed on 50 male prostate cancer patients referred due to biochemical recurrence. In all cases, previous imaging techniques were negative or inconclusive.  Results:   Of the 53 studies, 36 (68%) were positive. Significant differences were found between the positive and negative PET groups in Gleason's scale, PSA levels, PSAdt, late acquisition and the administration of androgen deprivation therapy during treatment (P<.05). Regarding PSA levels, 10 (48%) of the 21 patients with PSA<1ng/ml, obtained a pathological PET result. When the PSAdt was below six months, 86.7% of the patients obtained an abnormal PET. In the multivariate analysis, only Gleason's scale was associated independently with an abnormal PET result.  Conclusions: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET shows a high disease detection rate in patients where other techniques showed negative or doubtful images.

Objective:   Using Movember's Global Action Plan Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance initiative (GAP3) database, we report on reasons for AS discontinuation.  Design, setting, and participants:   We compared data from 10296 men on AS from 21 centres across 12 countries.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cumulative incidence methods were used to estimate the cumulative incidence rates of AS discontinuation.  Results and limitations:   During 5-yr follow-up, 27.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 26.4-28.6%) men showed signs of disease progression, 12.8% (95% CI: 12.0-13.6%) converted to active treatment without evidence of progression, 1.7% (95% CI: 1.5-2.0%) continued to watchful waiting, and 1.7% (95% CI: 1.4-2.1%) died from other causes. Of the 7049 men who remained on AS, 2339 had follow-up for >5yr, 4561 had follow-up for <5yr, and 149 were lost to follow-up. Cumulative incidence of progression was 27.5% (95% CI: 26.4-28.6%) at 5yr and 38.2% (95% CI: 36.7-39.9%) at 10yr. A limitation is that not all centres were included due to limited information on the reason for discontinuation and limited follow-up.  Conclusions:   Our descriptive analyses of current AS practices worldwide showed that 43.6% of men drop out of AS during 5-yr follow-up, mainly due to signs of disease progression. Improvements in selection tools for AS are thus needed to correctly allocate men with PCa to AS, which will also reduce discontinuation due to conversion to active treatment without evidence of disease progression.  Patient summary:   Our assessment of a worldwide database of men with prostate cancer (PCa) on active surveillance (AS) shows that 43.6% drop out of AS within 5yr, mainly due to signs of disease progression.

This division of slow and fast subsystems reduces the analysis and hence reduces the computation time, which can be expensive. In our new method, we first apply the singularly perturbed vector field method that is the global quasi-linearization method. This method exposes the hierarchy of a given complex system.

The 5 year survival rate remains extensively low owing to intrinsic resistance to conventional therapy which can be attributed to the genetic modulators involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, this study aims to generate a model for early diagnosis and timely treatment of liver metastasis in lung cancer patients.  Methods:   mRNA expression of 15 genes was quantified by real time PCR on lung cancer specimens with (n = 32) and without (n = 30) liver metastasis and their normal counterparts. Principal Component analysis, linear discriminant analysis and hierarchical clustering were conducted to obtain a predictive model. The accuracy of the models was tested by performing Receiver Operating Curve analysis.  Results:   The expression profile of all the 15 genes were subjected to PCA and LDA analysis and 5 models were generated. ROC curve analysis was performed for all the models and the individual genes. It was observed that out of the 15 genes only 8 genes showed significant sensitivity and specificity. Another model consisting of the selected eight genes was generated showing a specificity and sensitivity of 90.0 and 96.87 respectively (p <0.0001). Moreover, hierarchical clustering showed that tumors with a greater fold change lead to poor prognosis.

Methods::   41 consenting patients who underwent prostate DCE MR and dPET were included in this institutionally approved study.

Quantitative and semi-quantitative DCE MR and two-tissue compartmental model dPET parameters were determined and tumor-to-normal gland ratios (T/N) for these parameters were calculated. Finally, dPET and DCE MR correlation was estimated using Spearman correlation coefficients.  Results::   There were 46 malignant lesions per standard of reference. On dPET, peripheral zone (PZ) tumors had higher K1 (p < 0.001), and a T/N ratio ≥2 was significant (p < 0.001). On DCE MR, the parameters in, kep, Ktrans and quantitative iAUC were higher for PZ and non-PZ tumors than corresponding normal tissue (p < 0.001); for PZ tumors, a T/N ratio ≥ 1.5 for Ktrans and pei was significant (p = 0.0019 and 0.0026, respectively). Moderate Spearman correlation (0.40 < ρ < 0.59) was found between dPET K1 and DCE MR Ktrans and pei.  Conclusion::   In patients with high-risk PCa, quantitative dPET and DCE-MR parameters in primary tumors differ from normal tissue. Only moderate correlation exists between K1 (dPET) and Ktrans and pei (DCE MR). The incremental value of any of these parameters to PI-RADS v2 warrants further investigation.

We investigated the mechanism of galectin-9-induced cell death in PC-3 prostate cancer cells in comparison with in Jurkat T cells. Galectin-9 induced apoptotic cell death in Jurkat cells, as typically revealed by DNA ladder formation. On the other hand, DNA ladder formation and other features of apoptosis were not apparent in PC-3 cells undergoing galectin-9-induced death. Exogenous galectin-9 was endocytosed and destined to the lysosomal compartment in PC-3 cells. The internalized galectin-9 was resistant to detergent solubilization but was solubilized with lactose. Agents inhibiting actin filament dynamics abolished the internalization and cytocidal effect of galectin-9 in PC-3 but not Jurkat cells. Galectin-9 induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, possibly heterogeneously ubiquitinated and/or monoubiquitinated proteins, in PC-3 cells. PYR-41, an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating E1 enzyme, suppressed the cytocidal effect of galectin-9. Although ubiquitination was upregulated also in Jurkat cells by galectin-9, PYR-41 was ineffective against galectin-9-induced cell death. Colocalization of ubiquitinated proteins and LAMP-1 was detectable in PC-3 cells treated with galectin-9. The ubiquitinated proteins were recovered in the insoluble fraction upon cell fractionation. In contrast, ubiquitinated proteins that accumulated after treatment with proteasome inhibitors did not co-localize with LAMP-1 and were mainly recovered in soluble fraction.

One such possible new target is YWHAZ of the 14-3-3 protein family as this gene has prognostic significance for metastatic CRPC patients. However, there are no small molecules targeting YWHAZ commercially available. Hence, we explored whether the small molecule BV02 targeting another 14-3-3 protein family member SFN also binds to YWHAZ. Using advanced docking algorithms we find that BV02 docks many other 14-3-3 family members.

Patients and methods:   In all, 81 patients with LUTS, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) ≥10, maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax ) ≤12 mL/s, and prostate volume <75 mL, were enrolled in this prospective Research Ethics Committee-approved multicentre study. The main exclusion criteria were: haemostatic disorders, post-void residual urine volume (PVR) >250 mL, obstructive median lobe, and previous prostate surgery. The iTIND was implanted within the bladder neck and the prostatic urethra under light sedation, using a rigid cystoscope. The device was removed 5-7 days later in an outpatient setting. Demographics, perioperative results, complications (according to the Clavien-Dindo system), functional results and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively.  Results:   The mean (sd) patient age was 65 (8.9) years, prostate volume was 40.5 (12.25) mL, Qmax was 7.3 (2.6) mL/s, IPSS was 22.5 (5.6), and the median (interquartile range) IPSS QoL score was 4 (2-5). All the implantations were successful, with no intraoperative complications recorded; all patients were discharged on the same day of surgery. The devices were retrieved at a mean (SD) of 5.9 (1.1) days after implantation, typically under topical anaesthesia. No Clavien-Dindo Grade >II complications were recorded. The mean (SD) Qmax at the 1 month follow-up visit was 11.2 (5.7) mL/s and continued to improve thereafter, reaching 14.7 (8.1) mL/s at the 12-month follow-up visit (+100%). The mean (SD) IPSS urinary symptom scores were 11.7 (8.0) after 1 month and further improved to 8.8 (6.4) at the 12-month follow-up (-60%). In parallel, the mean (SD) IPSS QoL score drop reached 1.6 (1.3) by the end of the study. During the 12-month period, two patients (2.4%) required medical therapy for BPH, two patients (2.4%) required transurethral resection of the prostate, whilst 10 patients were lost to follow-up (12.3%). As compared to baseline, none of the 61 sexually active patients who completed the 12-month follow-up period reported sexual or ejaculatory dysfunction.  Conclusion:   iTIND implantation is feasible, safe and effective in providing relief of BPH-related symptoms, at least until 12 months postoperatively. Sexual and ejaculatory functions are fully preserved. Further studies with a longer follow-up period are needed to assess the durability of these results and to clearly define the indications for iTIND implantation.""","""['Francesco Porpiglia', 'Cristian Fiori', 'Daniele Amparore', 'Gregor Kadner', 'Arya Manit', 'Massimo Valerio', 'Lumen Nicolaas', 'Brian S H Ho', 'Sergio Alonso', 'Claude Schulman', 'Neil Barber']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Second-Generation of Temporary Implantable Nitinol Device for the Relief of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Results of a Prospective, Multicentre Study at 1 Year of Follow-up.', 'Temporary implantable nitinol device (TIND): a novel, minimally invasive treatment for relief of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): feasibility, safety and functional results at 1\xa0year of follow-up.', 'Second generation of temporary implantable nitinol device (iTind) in men with LUTS: 2\xa0year results of the MT-02-study.', '3-Year follow-up of temporary implantable nitinol device implantation for the treatment of benign prostatic obstruction.', 'The role of novel minimally invasive treatments for lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', ""What's New in TIND?"", 'Update on the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the role of minimally invasive procedures.', 'Pharmacological and interventional treatment of benign prostatic obstruction: An evidence-based comparative review.', 'iTIND for BPH: Technique and procedural outcomes: A narrative review of current literature.', 'Virtual and augmented reality in urology.', 'Minimally invasive treatment options for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.']"""

Methods:   Eligible prostate cancer patients from four cancer centres were recruited (November 2014-June 2015) from radiation or surgical oncology clinics. A physician and/or health care professional reviewed the EPIC-CP results as part of the clinical encounter. Patient experience with the tool was evaluated using a nine-item Patient Exit Survey (PES). Clinician experience was evaluated through semi-structured qualitative interviews. Patient and clinician results were compared to identify common themes.  Results:   A total of 333 patients were enrolled, of whom, 287 completed the PES. Most patients had one clinical encounter, although the number of EPIC-CP assessments ranged from 1 to 11 per patient, for a total of 937 EPIC-CP questionnaires completed. Item completion rates were high (91-100%), with items addressing sexual health among the lowest (91-92%). On the PES, most patients (70%) agreed with the item: ""Completing this questionnaire helped me tell the clinicians about how I have been feeling"". Thematic analysis from clinician interviews revealed that the EPIC-CP captures essential prostate-specific effects that facilitated person-centred communication and customization of interventions. Targeted clinical education and patient resources were seen as necessary for uptake.  Conclusions:   EPIC-CP was generally endorsed by clinicians and patients. The implementation of a disease-specific measure in place of a generic symptom screening tool has the potential to improve the quality of the clinical encounter and provide outcome measures for further health services research.

A key component of MR-TRUS fusion is image registration. However, it is very challenging to obtain a robust automatic MR-TRUS registration due to the large appearance difference between the two imaging modalities. The work presented in this paper aims to tackle this problem by addressing two challenges: (i) the definition of a suitable similarity metric and (ii) the determination of a suitable optimization strategy.  Methods:   This work proposes the use of a deep convolutional neural network to learn a similarity metric for MR-TRUS registration. We also use a composite optimization strategy that explores the solution space in order to search for a suitable initialization for the second-order optimization of the learned metric. Further, a multi-pass approach is used in order to smooth the metric for optimization.  Results:   The learned similarity metric outperforms the classical mutual information and also the state-of-the-art MIND feature-based methods. The results indicate that the overall registration framework has a large capture range. The proposed deep similarity metric-based approach obtained a mean TRE of 3.86 mm (with an initial TRE of 16 mm) for this challenging problem.  Conclusion:   A similarity metric that is learned using a deep neural network can be used to assess the quality of any given image registration and can be used in conjunction with the aforementioned optimization framework to perform automatic registration that is robust to poor initialization.""","""['Grant Haskins', 'Jochen Kruecker', 'Uwe Kruger', 'Sheng Xu', 'Peter A Pinto', 'Brad J Wood', 'Pingkun Yan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Robust 2-D-3-D Registration Optimization for Motion Compensation During 3-D TRUS-Guided Biopsy Using Learned Prostate Motion Data.', 'Non-rigid MR-TRUS image registration for image-guided prostate biopsy using correlation ratio-based mutual information.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.', 'Inter-fraction deformable image registration using unsupervised deep learning for CBCT-guided abdominal radiotherapy.', 'Double-Camera Fusion System for Animal-Position Awareness in Farming Pens.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Cross-modal attention for multi-modal image registration.', 'Custom 3D fMRI Registration Template Construction Method Based on Time-Series Fusion.']"""

Methods:   Prostate cancer patients were prospectively included between December 2011 and August 2014 and benefited from these three whole-body imaging (WBI) modalities within 1 month in addition to the standard PCa workup. Management was prospectively decided by clinicians during two multidisciplinary meetings, before and after the whole-body imaging workup. Rates of induced changes of whole-body imaging modalities were compared by Cochran's Q test.  Results:   One-hundred-one patients (27 at staging, 59 at first biochemical recurrence (BCR) and 15 at first episode of rising serum level of prostate-specific antigen during androgen-deprivation therapy) were included. The overall rate of management changes was 52%: 29% as a consequence of WBI, higher for FCH-PET/CT than for NaF-PET/CT or DW-MRI (p < 0.0001) and highest (41%) for FCH-PET/CT at BCR. Actual management was adequate in all patients but two.  Conclusions:   Whole-body imaging induced a change in management in approximately a third of PCa patients suspicious for metastasis.

Second, two readers identified the index lesion together, and then, reader one evaluated the contrast of index lesion on T2WI and signal ratio on apparent diffusion coefficient map. Third, they assigned Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score in consensus for the index lesion. After 4 weeks, the images of MISS were reviewed by the same readers following the same process. Finally, two readers gave preference for image interpretation, respectively. Kappa coefficient, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, paired-sample t-test, Bland-Altman analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used for statistical analysis. The acquisition time of CTD was 6 min and 10 s, while the acquisition time of MISS was 4 min and 30 s. Interobserver agreements for image evaluation were κ = 0.65 and κ = 0.80 for CTD and MISS, respectively. MISS-T2WI showed better delineation for seminal vesicles than CTD-T2WI (reader 1: P < 0.001, reader 2: P = 0.001). The index lesion demonstrated higher contrast in MISS-T2WI (P < 0.001).

The national cancer cohort, an exhaustive population-based cohort, was set up on the basis of the National Health Data System (SNDS) by the French National Cancer Institute.  Objectives:   The aim is to describe the French national cancer cohort.  Methods:   All people living in France (67 million population) with universal insurance coverage and diagnosed, treated or followed up for a cancer, such as survivors, are included and will be followed up for 25 years. It contains all healthcare consumptions and reimbursements (i.e. hospitalization, outpatient care, medication…) since 2010. Every year, around 650 000 new cases are included.  Results:   From 2010 to 2015, 6.2 million subjects have been included. Most subjects were entered in 2010, in 2015 it concerned 0.6 million. In 2015, the median age was 65 [54-76]; 51% were women. The primary cancer organ could be attributed with certitude to 87% of the people. The most frequent locations were skin (16%), breast (15%), prostate (12%), colon-rectum (11%) and lung (9%). In 2015, 40% of included subjects underwent surgery for cancer, 16% chemotherapy at hospital and 11% at least one session of radiotherapy.

Increased understanding of the prostate cancer metastasis mechanisms will help identify more efficient intervention strategies to prevent or treat this deadly disease in the future. To identify the candidate proteins that contribute to metastasis of PCa, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic analysis was performed to explore differentially expressed proteins between two homologous human prostate cancer cell lines including highly-metastatic PC-3M-1E8 cell line and poorly-metastatic PC-3M-2B4 cell line. Here, a total of 58 proteins were identified to be significantly differentially expressed between PC-3M-1E8 and PC-3M-2B4 cells, which were further verified using real-time quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. The bioinformatic analysis suggested that the differentially expressed proteins, like MMP1 and FHL1, may contribute to the higher metastatic ability of PC-3M-1E8 cells than PC-3M-2B4 cells. In addition, functional analyses proved MMP1's positive effect on the higher metastatic ability of PC-3M-1E8 cells than PC-3M-2B4 cells.

Depletion of GRB10 increases insulin sensitivity and overexpression suppresses PI3K/Akt signaling. Because the major reason for the limited efficacy of PI3K/Akt-targeted therapies in prostate cancer (PCa) is loss of mTOR-regulated feedback suppression, it is therefore important to assess the functional importance and regulation of GRB10 under these conditions. On the basis of these background observations, we explored the status and functional impact of GRB10 in PCa and found maximum expression in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient PCa. In human PCa samples, GRB10 inversely correlated with PTEN and positively correlated with pAKT levels. Knockdown of GRB10 in nontumorigenic PTEN null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and tumorigenic PCa cell lines reduced Akt phosphorylation and selectively activated a panel of receptor tyrosine kinases. Similarly, overexpression of GRB10 in PTEN wild-type PCa cell lines accelerated tumorigenesis and induced Akt phosphorylation. In PTEN wild-type PCa, GRB10 overexpression promoted mediated PTEN interaction and degradation. PI3K (but not mTOR) inhibitors reduced GRB10 expression, suggesting primarily PI3K-driven regulation of GRB10. In summary, our results suggest that GRB10 acts as a major downstream effector of PI3K and has tumor-promoting effects in prostate cancer.-Khan, M.

Consented human tissues are procured according to researcher specifications for weight (size) and preservation type; weights of samples in significant demand and limited supply are negotiated. Weights of procured tissues are entered into a dedicated biospecimen database. This study seeks to provide guidance for acceptable tissue weights for researchers. Methods: Tissue weights by year and anatomic site were retrieved from the database for primary malignant tissues. The total number of tissues included was 5141. Statistical evaluation of data included the number of tissues for each year, anatomic site as well as minimum, maximum, average weights, standard deviation, and standard error. Anatomic sites with few tissues were excluded. Results: ""Stock price"" type graphs were constructed to show an average as ""volume"" with both full weight ranges and range that accommodated 80% of tissues. Average weight and number of sample trends varied by anatomic site. Tissues fell into four weight groups; 10 and 90 percentile boundaries were calculated for each. Smallest average research tissue weights for middle 80% were recorded for prostate and oropharynx (140 mg). Second weight group included tonsil, thyroid, breast, oral cavity, larynx, pancreas, salivary gland, skin, tongue, lung, and parotid (265 mg). The third group included stomach, cervix, colon, esophagus, endometrium, bone, brain, bladder, small bowel, uterus, liver, kidney lymph node, adrenal, and ovary (513 mg). The fourth and heaviest weight group included soft tissue tumors and spleen (1201 mg).

Patients and methods:   With ethics approval, 536 imaging volumes were generated from 20 consecutive patients who underwent multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) at time of biopsy. Volumes of interest (VOIs) included zonal anatomy segmentation and suspicious MRI lesions for cancer (Likert Scale score >2). Entropy (E), measuring heterogeneity, was computed from VOIs and plotted as a multiparametric score defined as the entropy score (ES) = E ADC + E Ktrans + E Ve + E T2WI. The reference test that was used to define the ground truth comprised systematic saturation biopsies coupled with MRI-targeted sampling. This generated 422 cores in all that were individually labelled and oriented in three-dimensions. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of SPCa, defined as Gleason score ≥3 + 4 or >3 mm of any grade of cancer on a single core, was assessed using receiver operating characteristics, correlation, and descriptive statistics. The proportion of cancerous lesions detected by ES and visual scoring (VS) were statistically compared using the paired McNemar test.  Results:   Any cancer (Gleason score 6-8) was found in 12 of the 20 (60%) patients, with a median PSA level of 8.22 ng/mL. SPCa (mean [95% confidence interval, CI] ES = 17.96 [0.72] NATural information unit [NAT]) had a significantly higher ES than non-SPCa (mean [95% CI] ES = 15.33 [0.76] NAT). The ES correlated with Gleason score (rs = 0.568, P = 0.033) and maximum cancer core length (ρ = 0.781; P < 0.001). The area under the curve for the ES (0.89) and VS (0.91) were not significantly different (P = 0.75) for the detection of SPCa amongst MRI lesions. Best ES estimated numerical threshold of 16.61 NAT led to a sensitivity of 100% and negative predictive value of 100%. The proportion of MRI lesions that were found to be positive for SPCa using this ES threshold (54%) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than using the VS (24% of score 3, 4, 5) in a paired analysis using the McNemar test. In all, 53% of MRI lesions would have avoided biopsy sampling without missing significant disease.  Conclusion:   Capturing heterogeneity of prostate cancer across multiple MRI sequences with the ES yielded high performances for the detection and stratification of SPCa.

The main purpose of this study is to address the high computational time of microstructural model fitting for prostate diagnosis, while retaining utility in terms of tumour conspicuity and repeatability. In this work, we adapt the accelerated microstructure imaging via convex optimization (AMICO) framework to linearize the estimation of VERDICT parameters for the prostate gland. We compare the original non-linear fitting of VERDICT with the linear fitting, quantifying accuracy with synthetic data, and computational time and reliability (performance and precision) in eight patients. We also assess the repeatability (scan-rescan) of the parameters. Comparison of the original VERDICT fitting versus VERDICT-AMICO showed that the linearized fitting (1) is more accurate in simulation for a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 dB; (2) reduces the processing time by three orders of magnitude, from 6.55 seconds/voxel to 1.78 milliseconds/voxel; (3) estimates parameters more precisely; (4) produces similar parametric maps and (5) produces similar estimated parameters with a high Pearson correlation between implementations, r2 > 0.7.

We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of a natural triterpenoid, ganoderic acid DM (GA-DM), on two human prostate cancer cell lines: the androgen-independent prostate carcinoma (PC-3), and androgen-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma (LNCaP). Cell viability assay showed that GA-DM was relatively more toxic to LNCaP cells than to PC-3 cells (IC50 s ranged 45-55 µM for PC-3, and 20-25 µM for LNCaP), which may have occurred due to differential expression of p53. Hoechst DNA staining confirmed detectable nuclear fragmentation in both cell lines irrespective of the p53 status. GA-DM treatment decreased Bcl-2 proteins while it upregulated apoptotic Bax and autophagic Beclin-1, Atg5, and LC-3 molecules, and caused an induction of both early and late events of apoptotic cell death. Biochemical analyses of GA-DM-treated prostate cancer cells demonstrated that caspase-3 cleavage was notable in GA-DM-treated PC-3 cells. Interestingly, GA-DM treatment altered cell cycle progression in the S phase with a significant growth arrest in the G2 checkpoint and enhanced CD4 + T cell recognition of prostate tumor cells. Mechanistic study of GA-DM-treated prostate cancer cells further demonstrated that calpain activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress contributed to cell death. These findings suggest that GA-DM is a candidate for future drug design for prostate cancer as it activates multiple pathways of cell death and immune recognition.""","""['Benjamin M Johnson', 'Faisal F Y Radwan', 'Azim Hossain', 'Bently P Doonan', 'Jessica D Hathaway-Schrader', 'Jason M God', 'Christina V Voelkel-Johnson', 'Narendra L Banik', 'Sakamuri V Reddy', 'Azizul Haque']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Betulinic Acid-Mediated Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer Cells Involves p53 and Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) Pathways.', 'Ganoderic acid DM induces autophagic apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR activity.', 'Tubeimoside-1 induces oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest in human prostate carcinoma cells in vitro.', 'New Insight into Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Therapy: The Potential Roles of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Autophagy Mechanisms.', 'Intracellular death platform steps-in: targeting prostate tumors via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) apoptosis.', 'Peptide Modification Diminishes HLA Class II-restricted CD4+ T Cell Recognition of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Inhibition of acid ceramidase regulates MHC class II antigen presentation and suppression of autoimmune arthritis.']"""

We have used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to assess whether inhibition of AKT signalling would result in metabolic changes that could potentially be used as biomarkers to monitor response to AKT inhibition.  Methods:   Cellular and metabolic effects of the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206 were investigated in HT29 colon and PC3 prostate cancer cells and xenografts using flow cytometry, immunoblotting, immunohistology and MRS.  Results:   In vitro treatment with MK-2206 inhibited AKT signalling and resulted in time-dependent alterations in glucose, glutamine and phospholipid metabolism. In vivo, MK-2206 resulted in inhibition of AKT signalling and tumour growth compared with vehicle-treated controls. In vivo MRS analysis of HT29 subcutaneous xenografts showed similar metabolic changes to those seen in vitro including decreases in the tCho/water ratio, tumour bioenergetic metabolites and changes in glutamine and glutathione metabolism. Similar phosphocholine changes compared to in vitro were confirmed in the clinically relevant orthotopic PC3 model.

However, repeated studies of the same question may be undertaken without enhancing existing knowledge. To identify settings in which additional research is or is not warranted, we adapted research synthesis metrics to determine number of additional observational studies needed to change the inference from an existing meta-analysis.  Methods:   The fail-safe number (FSN) estimates number of additional studies of average weight and null effect needed to drive a statistically significant meta-analysis to null (P ≥ 0.05). We used conditional power to determine number of additional studies of average weight and equivalent heterogeneity to achieve 80% power in an updated meta-analysis to detect the observed summary estimate as statistically significant. We applied these metrics to a curated set of 98 meta-analyses on biomarkers and cancer risk.  Results:   Both metrics were influenced by number of studies, heterogeneity, and summary estimate size in the existing meta-analysis. For the meta-analysis on Helicobacter pylori and gastric cancer with 15 studies [OR = 2.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.71-3.05], FSN was 805 studies, supporting futility of further study. For the meta-analysis on dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and prostate cancer with 7 studies (OR = 1.29; 95% CI, 0.99-1.69), 5 more studies would be needed for 80% power, suggesting further study could change inferences.  Conclusions:   Along with traditional assessments, these metrics could be used by stakeholders to decide whether additional studies addressing the same question are needed.  Impact:   Systematic application of these metrics could lead to more judicious use of resources and acceleration from discovery to population-health impact.""","""['Michael T Marrone', 'Konstantinos K Tsilidis', 'Stephan Ehrhardt', 'Corinne E Joshu', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Thomas A Sellers', 'Elizabeth A Platz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Helicobacter pylori infection causes gastric cancer?

Computer-tailored PA interventions can reach large populations with little resources. They match with patients' preference for home-based, unsupervised PA programs and are thus promising for the growing population of cancer survivors. The current study assessed the efficacy of a computer-tailored PA intervention in (four subgroups of) prostate and colorectal cancer survivors.  Methods:   Prostate and colorectal cancer patients and survivors were randomized to the OncoActive intervention group (N = 249), or a usual-care waiting-list control group (N = 229). OncoActive participants received a pedometer and computer-tailored PA advice, both Web-based via an interactive website and with printed materials. Minutes moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and days ≥30 min PA were assessed with an accelerometer (ActiGraph) at baseline and 6 months. Further, questionnaires were used to assess self-reported PA, fatigue, distress, and quality of life at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Differences between both groups were assessed using linear regression analyses (complete cases and intention-to-treat). In addition, efficacy in relation to age, gender, education, type of cancer, and time since treatment was examined.  Results:   Three months after baseline OncoActive participants significantly increased their self-reported PA (PA days: d = 0.46; MVPA: d = 0.23). Physical functioning (d = 0.23) and fatigue (d = - 0.21) also improved significantly after three months. Six months after baseline, self-reported PA (PA days: d = 0.51; MVPA: d = 0.37) and ActiGraph MVPA (d = 0.27) increased significantly, and ActiGraph days (d = 0.16) increased borderline significantly (p = .05; d = 0.16). Furthermore, OncoActive participants reported significantly improvements in physical functioning (d = 0.14), fatigue (d = - 0.23) and depression (d = - 0.32). Similar results were found for intention-to-treat analyses. Higher increases in PA were found for colorectal cancer participants at 3 months, and for medium and highly educated participants' PA at 6 months. Health outcomes at 6 months were more prominent in colorectal cancer participants and in women.  Conclusions:   The OncoActive intervention was effective at increasing PA in prostate and colorectal cancer patients and survivors. Health-related effects were especially apparent in colorectal cancer participants. The intervention provides opportunities to accelerate cancer recovery. Long-term follow-up should examine further sustainability of these effects.

In this study, we examined the association between BIRC7 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of prostate cancer, the independent prognostic value of BIRC7 in terms of recurrence-free survival, and the molecular mechanisms of its dysregulation.  Methods:   Data mining was performed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The patients were divided into high and low BIRC7 expression groups according to the Youden index determined by receiver operating characteristic curves for recurrence. Subgroup analysis was performed according to T stages and Gleason score.  Results:   BIRC7 was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer tissues (N = 497) than in normal prostate tissues (N = 52). High BIRC7 expression group had lower ratios of overall response rate and medium-grade (Gleason score 6-7) tumors and higher proportions of nodal invasion and recurrence after surgery. Although Kaplan-Meier curves showed that high BIRC7 expression was generally associated with poor recurrence-free survival, the following subgroup analysis only confirmed the association in T3/T4 and medium-grade tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that BIRC7 expression was not an independent indicator of recurrence-free survival in T2 or high-grade tumors, but was independently associated with poor recurrence-free survival in T3/T4 tumors (hazard ratio: 4.249, 95% confidence interval: 1.563-11.546, P = .005) and in medium-grade tumors (hazard ratio: 6.041, 95% confidence interval: 1.763-20.703, P = .004). DNA amplification was associated with significantly upregulated BIRC7 expression. There was also a weak negative correlation between BIRC7 expression and its DNA methylation (Pearson r = -0.23).  Conclusion:   Based on these findings, we infer that BIRC7 upregulation might serve as a valuable biomarker of increased recurrence risk in advanced T stages and medium-grade prostate cancer. Its expression is at least regulated by both copy number alteration and DNA methylation.""","""['Yi Yang', 'Peng Sun', 'Wei Xu', 'Wei Xia']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['BIRC7 and STC2 Expression Are Associated With Tumorigenesis and Poor Outcome in Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.', 'BIRC7 and KLF4 expression in benign and malignant lesions of pancreas and their clinicopathological significance.', 'Comparative study of clinicopathological significance, BIRC7, and STC2 expression between squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinomas and adenocarcinoma of gallbladder.', 'Incorporating Prognostic Biomarkers into Risk Assessment Models and TNM Staging for Prostate Cancer.', 'DNA Methylation-Based Testing in Liquid Biopsies as Detection and Prognostic Biomarkers for the Four Major Cancer Types.', 'RNA-seq and ChIP-seq Identification of Unique and Overlapping Targets of GLI Transcription Factors in Melanoma Cell Lines.', 'Livin/BIRC7 gene expression as a possible diagnostic biomarker for endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma.', 'BIRC7 and STC2 Expression Are Associated With Tumorigenesis and Poor Outcome in Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.']"""

Vision researchers have been analyzing behaviors of radiologists during screening to understand how and why they miss tumors or misdiagnose. In this regard, eye-trackers have been instrumental in understanding visual search processes of radiologists. However, most relevant studies in this aspect are not compatible with realistic radiology reading rooms. In this study, we aim to develop a paradigm shifting CAD system, called collaborative CAD (C-CAD), that unifies CAD and eye-tracking systems in realistic radiology room settings. We first developed an eye-tracking interface providing radiologists with a real radiology reading room experience. Second, we propose a novel algorithm that unifies eye-tracking data and a CAD system. Specifically, we present a new graph based clustering and sparsification algorithm to transform eye-tracking data (gaze) into a graph model to interpret gaze patterns quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed C-CAD collaborates with radiologists via eye-tracking technology and helps them to improve their diagnostic decisions. The C-CAD uses radiologists' search efficiency by processing their gaze patterns. Furthermore, the C-CAD incorporates a deep learning algorithm in a newly designed multi-task learning platform to segment and diagnose suspicious areas simultaneously. The proposed C-CAD system has been tested in a lung cancer screening experiment with multiple radiologists, reading low dose chest CTs. Promising results support the efficiency, accuracy and applicability of the proposed C-CAD system in a real radiology room setting. We have also shown that our framework is generalizable to more complex applications such as prostate cancer screening with multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI).""","""['Naji Khosravan', 'Haydar Celik', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Elizabeth C Jones', 'Bradford Wood', 'Ulas Bagci']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Visual search in breast imaging.', 'Evaluating the performance of a deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (DL-CAD) system for detecting and characterizing lung nodules: Comparison with the performance of double reading by radiologists.', 'A Novel Deep Learning Based Computer-Aided Diagnosis System Improves the Accuracy and Efficiency of Radiologists in Reading Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Images of the Prostate: Results of a Multireader, Multicase Study.', 'Convolutional neural networks for computer-aided detection or diagnosis in medical image analysis: An overview.', 'Deep learning beyond cats and dogs: recent advances in diagnosing breast cancer with deep neural networks.', 'Machine Learning for Lung Cancer Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis.', 'REFLACX, a dataset of reports and eye-tracking data for localization of abnormalities in chest x-rays.', 'Development and multicenter validation of chest X-ray radiography interpretations based on natural language processing.', 'Machine learning in patient flow: a review.', 'Deep Learning Application for Analyzing of Constituents and Their Correlations in the Interpretations of Medical Images.']"""

We used our technology of Polypurine reverse Hoogsteen hairpins (PPRHs) for silencing both genes with the aim to provoke the elimination of tumor cells by macrophages in co-culture experiments. Incubation of PPRHs against PD-1 and PD-L1 decreased the levels of mRNA and protein in THP-1 monocytes and PC3 prostate cancer cells, respectively. Viability of THP-1 cells and macrophages obtained by PMA-differentiation of THP-1 cells was not affected upon incubation with the different PPRHs. On the other hand, PC3 cell survival was partially decreased by PPRHs against PD-L1. The greatest effect in decreasing cell viability was obtained in macrophages/PC3 co-culture experiments by combining PPRHs against PD-1 and PD-L1. This effect was also observed in other cancer cell lines: HeLa, SKBR3 and to a minor extent in M21. Apoptosis was not detected when macrophages were treated with the different PPRHs. However, co-cultures of macrophages with the four cancer cell lines treated with PPRHs showed an increase in apoptosis. The order of fold-increase in apoptosis was HeLa > PC3 > SKBR3 > M21. This study demonstrates that PPRHs could be powerful pharmacological agents to use in immunotherapy approaches for the inhibition of PD-1 and PD-L1.""","""['Miriam Marlene Medina Enríquez', 'Alex J Félix', 'Carlos J Ciudad', 'Véronique Noé']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Silencing PD-1 and PD-L1: the potential of PolyPurine Reverse Hoogsteen hairpins for the elimination of tumor cells.', 'Polypurine reverse Hoogsteen hairpins as a gene therapy tool against survivin in human prostate cancer PC3 cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Nucleic acids therapeutics using PolyPurine Reverse Hoogsteen hairpins.', 'Clinical applications of PD-L1 bioassays for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Polypurine Reverse Hoogsteen Hairpins as a Gene Silencing Tool for Cancer.', 'In Vitro and In Vivo Effects of the Combination of Polypurine Reverse Hoogsteen Hairpins against HER-2 and Trastuzumab in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting KRAS Regulation with PolyPurine Reverse Hoogsteen Oligonucleotides.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

Results of a Single-Center Randomized Clinical Trial""","""Objective: To investigate by means of a randomized clinical trial the safety of no drain in the pelvic cavity after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with or without extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND). Materials and Methods: From May to December 2016, 112 consecutive patients who underwent RARP with or without ePLND were prospectively randomized into a control group (CG) and study group (SG). In the CG, a drain was placed in the pelvic cavity at the end of surgery and removed after 24 hours. The trial was designed to assess noninferiority. The primary endpoint was evaluated as complication rates graded by the Clavien-Dindo score (CDS). Secondary endpoints included length of hospital stay (LOHS) and hospital readmission (RAD). Results and Limitations: At final analysis, 56 patients were in the CG and 54 belonged to the SG. The groups were homogenous for all preoperative and perioperative variables and did not show any difference in CDS complication rates (28.9% in the CG and 20.4% in the SG; p = 0.254), LOHS (on average 4 days in each group; p = 0.689), and RAD rates (3.6% in the CG and 3.7% in the SG; p = 0.970). Conclusions: In a modern cohort of patients who underwent RARP with or without ePLND, a single-center randomized controlled trial showed that no-drain policy is equivalent to drain after RARP in terms of CDS complication rate, LOHS, and RAD rate. The option of placing a postoperative drain for the first 24 hours could be considered in cases of difficult urethrovesical anastomosis with uncertain watertightness.""","""['Antonio B Porcaro', 'Salvatore Siracusano', 'Leonardo Bizzotto', 'Marco Sebben', 'Giovanni E Cacciamani', 'Nicolò de Luyk', 'Paolo Corsi', 'Alessandro Tafuri', 'Tania Processali', 'Daniele Mattevi', 'Maria A Cerruto', 'Matteo Brunelli', 'Giovanni Novella', 'Vincenzo De Marco', 'Walter Artibani']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Effect of Peritoneal Fixation (PerFix) on Lymphocele Formation in Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy with Pelvic Lymphadenectomy: Results of a Randomized Prospective Trial.', 'Prospective randomised non-inferiority trial of pelvic drain placement vs no pelvic drain placement after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The impact of extended pelvic lymph node dissection on the risk of hospital readmission within 180\xa0days after robot assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'The role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection in the management of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', ""American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) Physical Status System and Risk of Major Clavien-Dindo Complications After Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy at Hospital Discharge: Analysis of 1143 Consecutive Prostate Cancer Patients."", 'Review of the use of prophylactic drain tubes post-robotic radical prostatectomy: Dogma or decent practice?', 'ABO blood group system and risk of positive surgical margins in patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results in 1114 consecutive patients.', 'Reporting and grading of complications after mid-urethral sling surgeries: Could the ""Clavien-Dindo Classification"" be adopted?', 'Predictors of complications occurring after open and robot-assisted prostate cancer surgery: a retrospective evaluation of 1062 consecutive patients treated in a tertiary referral high volume center.']"""

The cause and consequences of this loss have thus far been unknown. We found that in middle-aged rats a Zn-deficient diet reduces prostatic Zn levels (P = 0.025), increases cellular proliferation, and induces an inflammatory phenotype with COX-2 overexpression. This hyperplastic/inflammatory prostate has a human prostate cancer-like microRNA profile, with up-regulation of the Zn-homeostasis-regulating miR-183-96-182 cluster (fold change = 1.41-2.38; P = 0.029-0.0003) and down-regulation of the Zn importer ZIP1 (target of miR-182), leading to a reduction of prostatic Zn. This inverse relationship between miR-182 and ZIP1 also occurs in human prostate cancer tissue, which is known for Zn loss. The discovery that the Zn-depleted middle-aged rat prostate has a metabolic phenotype resembling that of human prostate cancer, with a 10-fold down-regulation of citric acid (P = 0.0003), links citrate reduction directly to prostatic Zn loss, providing the underlying mechanism linking dietary Zn deficiency with miR-183-96-182 overexpression, ZIP1 down-regulation, prostatic Zn loss, and the resultant citrate down-regulation, changes mimicking features of human prostate cancer. Thus, dietary Zn deficiency during rat middle age produces changes that mimic those of human prostate carcinoma and may increase the risk for prostate cancer, supporting the need for assessment of Zn supplementation in its prevention.""","""['Louise Y Fong', 'Ruiyan Jing', 'Karl J Smalley', 'Zi-Xuan Wang', 'Cristian Taccioli', 'Sili Fan', 'Hongping Chen', 'Hansjuerg Alder', 'Kay Huebner', 'John L Farber', 'Oliver Fiehn', 'Carlo M Croce']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Human prostate cancer ZIP1/zinc/citrate genetic/metabolic relationship in the TRAMP prostate cancer animal model.', 'hZIP1 zinc uptake transporter down regulation and zinc depletion in prostate cancer.', 'hZip2 and hZip3 zinc transporters are down regulated in human prostate adenocarcinomatous glands.', 'The clinical relevance of the metabolism of prostate cancer; zinc and tumor suppression: connecting the dots.', 'Differentiation pathways and histogenetic aspects of normal and abnormal prostatic growth: a stem cell model.', 'Zinc treatment reverses and anti-Zn-regulated miRs suppress esophageal carcinomas in\xa0vivo.', 'Upregulated Solute Carrier SLC39A1 Promotes Gastric Cancer Proliferation and Indicates Unfavorable Prognosis.', 'Expression of SLC22A18 regulates oxaliplatin resistance by modulating the ERK pathway in colorectal cancer.', 'Dietary Factors and Prostate Cancer Development, Progression, and Reduction.', 'Evaluation of the prognostic values of solute carrier (SLC) family 39 genes for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

Simultaneous treatment of cells with taxanes and flavonoids baicalein, chrysin, luteolin, fisetin, quercetin, genistein or daidzein did not lead to any change in chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. However, simultaneous exposure of cells to hesperetin and taxanes resulted in 9.8- and 13.1-fold reduction in cytotoxicity of docetaxel and cabazitaxel, respectively.

We compared the performance of the Prostate Health Index (PHI) for 2488 men in different ethnic groups (1688 Asian and 800 European men from 9 sites) with PSA 2-20ng/ml and PHI test and transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy results available. Of these, 1652 men had PSA 2-10ng/ml and a normal digital rectal examination and underwent initial biopsy. The proportions of PC (Gleason ≥6) and higher-grade PC (HGPC, Gleason ≥7) across different PHI ranges were compared. The performance of PSA and PHI was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and decision curve analyses (DCA). Among Asian men, HGPC would be diagnosed in 1.0%, 1.9%, 13%, and 30% of men using PHI thresholds of <25, 25-35, 35-55, and >55, respectively. At 90% sensitivity for HGPC (PHI >30), 56% of biopsies and 33% of Gleason 6 PC diagnoses could have been avoided. Among European men, HGPC would be diagnosed in 4.1%, 4.3%, 30%, and 34% of men using PHI thresholds of <25, 25-35, 35-55, and >55, respectively. At 90% sensitivity for HGPC (PHI >40), 40% of biopsies and 31% of Gleason 6 PC diagnoses could have been avoided. AUC and DCA confirmed the benefit of PHI over PSA. The benefit of PHI was also seen at repeat biopsy (n=397) and for PSA 10-20ng/ml (n=439). PHI is effective in cancer risk stratification for both European and Asian men. However, population-specific PHI reference ranges should be used.

Methods:   To determine whether the differentially expressed circRNAs in prostate cancer can serve as novel biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis, we screened differentially expressed circRNAs using SBC-ceRNA array in 4 pairs of prostate tumor and paracancerous tissues. A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network for the differential circRNAs and their host genes was constructed by Cytoscape3.5.1 software. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis (qRT-PCR) was performed to confirm the microarray data.  Results:   We found 1021 differentially expressed circRNAs in PCa tumor using SBC-ceRNA array and confirmed the expression of circ_0057558, circ_0062019 and SLC19A1 in PCa cell lines and tumor tissues through qRT-PCR analysis. We demonstrated that combination of PSA level and two differentially expressed circRNAs showed significantly increased AUC, sensitivity and specificity (0.938, 84.5% and 90.9%, respectively) than PSA alone (AUC of serum PSA was 0.854). Moreover, circ_0057558 was correlated positively with total cholesterol.

Our purpose was to examine the effects of targeted exercise modes on BMD in men with PCa undergoing ADT.  Methods:   Between 2009 and 2012, 154 PCa patients 43-90 yr old on ADT were randomized to exercise targeting the musculoskeletal system (impact loading + resistance training [ImpRes], n = 57) supervised for 12 months, cardiovascular and muscular systems (aerobic + resistance training, n = 50) supervised for 6 months followed by a 6-month home-based program, or delayed aerobic exercise (DelAer, n = 47) received exercise information for 6 months followed by 6 months of supervised aerobic exercise (stationary cycling). End points were lumbar spine, hip and whole-body BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry with secondary end points of lean and fat mass, appendicular skeletal muscle mass, and neuromuscular strength. ANOVA was used to compare the exercise groups with DelAer at 6 and 12 months.  Results:   There was a between-group difference in BMD for ImpRes and DelAer at the spine (6 months, P = 0.039; 12 months, P = 0.035) and femoral neck (6 months, P = 0.050), with decline attenuated in ImpRes (~-1.0% vs ~-2.0%).

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation of preoperative tracer uptake of primary tumor to Gleason Score in patients who underwent prostatectomy.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 141 patients who had Ga-68-PSMA positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging and who underwent prostatectomy. All patients had a diagnosis of prostate cancer on the basis of 10-24 cores transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS-Bx). Histological assessment was performed according to the New Contemporary Prostate Cancer Grading System. All patients had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level measurement within maximum of 28 days before Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT. Region of interests were drawn manually around the prostate gland, avoiding the bladder activity, to calculate the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) values.  Results:   The median PSA values for all patients were 10.0 ng/ml. PSA values for low-risk patients were significantly lower than those of high-risk patients (P<0.001). There were 41.1% upgrades and 7.8% downgrades following prostatectomy in terms of Grade Groups. According to the final pathology reports, 21% (n=16) of patients moved from a low-risk level (grade groups 1+2) to a high-risk level (grade groups 3+4+5). The median SUVmax value was 8.8, ranging from 2.1 to 62.4. There was a strong correlation between SUVmax values and grade groups (Pearson ρ=0.66) (P<0.001).

Data were retrospectively evaluated for their distinction between prostate pathologies.Eight hundred fifty-seven areas of normal gland (n = 378), prostate cancer (54x Gleason score 6, 98x Gleason score 7, 25x Gleason score 8), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) nodes (n = 150), prostatitis (n = 119), and precancerous lesions (n = 33) were determined on calculated and morphological T2w images. Histological criterion standards were whole gland sections (16 patients), MRI-guided in-bore biopsies (32 patients), MRI/transrectal ultrasound-fusion biopsies (15 patients), and systematic 12-core transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies (12 patients). Significance was assumed to be P < 0.05.  Results:   The quantitative T2 values vary significantly between prostate cancer and normal gland tissue (area under the curve [AUC], 0.871), cancer and BPH nodes (AUC = 0.827), and Gleason score 6 and 7 or higher (AUC, 0.742). The quantitative T2 values decrease with increasing Gleason scores and correlate significantly with the ADC values (r = 0.806).The detection accuracy of prostate cancer on calculated (AUC = 0.682) and morphological T2w images (AUC = 0.658) is not significantly different.

However, the molecular mechanism of rottlerin-mediated anti-tumor activity is still ambiguous. It has been reported that EZH2 exhibits oncogenic functions in a variety of human cancers. Therefore, inhibition of EZH2 could be a promising strategy for the treatment of human cancers. In this study, we aim to explore whether rottlerin could inhibit tumorigenesis via suppression of EZH2 in prostate cancer cells. Multiple approaches such as FACS, Transwell invasion assay, RT-PCR, Western blotting, and transfection were performed to determine our aim. We found that rottlerin treatment led to inhibition of cell growth, migration and invasion, but induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Importantly, we defined that rottlerin decreased the expression of EZH2 and H3K27me3 in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, overexpression of EZH2 abrogated the rottlerin-induced inhibition of cell growth, migration, and invasion in prostate cancer cells. Consistently, down-regulation of EZH2 enhanced rottlerin-triggered anti-tumor function. Collectively, our work demonstrated that rottlerin exerted its tumor suppressive function via inhibition of EZH2 expression in prostate cancer cells. Our findings indicated that rottlerin might be a potential therapeutic compound for treating patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Nana Zheng', 'Lixia Wang', 'Yingying Hou', 'Xiuxia Zhou', 'Youhua He', 'Zhiwei Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Rottlerin exhibits antitumor activity via down-regulation of TAZ in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Rottlerin inhibits cell growth and invasion via down-regulation of Cdc20 in glioma cells.', 'Rottlerin exerts its anti-tumor activity through inhibition of Skp2 in breast cancer cells.', 'Rottlerin and cancer: novel evidence and mechanisms.', 'The molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential of EZH2 in breast cancer.', 'SMYD2 aggravates gastrointestinal stromal tumor via upregulation of EZH2 and downregulation of TET1.', 'Construction of Bone Metastasis-Specific Regulation Network Based on Prognostic Stemness-Related Signatures in Prostate Cancer.', 'Co-administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with rottlerin in metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Predictive biomarkers and potential drug combinations of epi-drugs in cancer therapy.']"""

Regarding Ca2+ signaling, timolol was shown to modulate Ca2+-related physiology in various cell types, however, the effect of timolol on Ca2+ homeostasis and cell viability has not been explored in human prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of timolol on intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and viability in PC3 human prostate cancer cells. Timolol at concentrations of 100-1000 μM induced [Ca2+]i rises. The Ca2+ signal in Ca2+-containing medium was reduced by removal of extracellular Ca2+ by approximately 75%. Timolol (1000 μM) induced Mn2+ influx suggesting of Ca2+ entry. Timolol-induced Ca2+ entry was partially inhibited by three inhibitors of store-operated Ca2+ channels: nifedipine, econoazole and SKF96365, and by a protein kinase C (PKC) activator (phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate [PMA]) or an inhibitor (GF109203X). In Ca2+-free medium, treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump inhibitor thapsigargin abolished timolol-evoked [Ca2+]i rises. Conversely, treatment with timolol abolished thapsigargin-evoked [Ca2+]i rises. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 abolished timolol-induced [Ca2+]i rises. Timolol at concentrations between 200 and 600 μM killed cells in a concentration-dependent fashion. Chelation of cytosolic Ca2+ with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid/AM (BAPTA/AM) did not reverse cytotoxicity of timolol. Together, in PC3 cells, timolol induced [Ca2+]i rises by evoking Ca2+release from the endoplasmic reticulum in a PLC-dependent manner, and Ca2+ influx via PKC-regulated store-operated Ca2+ entry. Timolol also caused cell death that was not linked to preceding [Ca2+]i rises.""","""['Jue-Long Wang', 'Chiang-Ting Chou', 'Wei-Zhe Liang', 'Cherng-Jer Wu', 'Chun-Chi Kuo', 'Lyh-Jyh Hao', 'Pochuen Shieh', 'Chung-Ren Jan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Toxicol Mech Methods""","""['Effect of 2,5-dimethylphenol on Ca(2+) movement and viability in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms underlying the effect of an oral antihyperglycaemic agent glyburide on calcium ion (Ca2+ ) movement and its related cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells.', 'The investigation of minoxidil-induced Ca2+i rises and non-Ca2+-triggered cell death in PC3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Ca2+ tunnelling through the ER lumen as a mechanism for delivering Ca2+ entering via store-operated Ca2+ channels to specific target sites.', 'Marine Heterocyclic Compounds That Modulate Intracellular Calcium Signals: Chemistry and Synthesis Approaches.']"""

The aim of this work is to present and validate a novel model based reconstruction method that can correct for these distortions.  Methods:   In regions of severe signal pileup, standard techniques for distortion correction have difficulty recovering the underlying true signal. Furthermore, because of drifts and inaccuracies in the determination of center frequency, echo planar imaging (EPI) scans can be shifted in the phase-encoding direction. In this work, using a B0 field map and a set of EPI data acquired with blip-up and blip-down phase encoding gradients, we model the distortion correction problem linking the distortion-free image to the acquired raw corrupted k-space data and solve it in a manner analogous to the sensitivity encoding method. Both a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the proposed method is performed in vivo in 10 patients.  Results:   Without distortion correction, mean Dice similarity scores between a reference T2W and the uncorrected EPI images were 0.64 and 0.60 for b-values of 0 and 500 s/mm2 , respectively. Compared to the Topup (distortion correction method commonly used for neuro imaging), the proposed method achieved Dice scores (0.87 and 0.85 versus 0.82 and 0.80) and better qualitative results in patients where signal pileup was present because of high rectal gas residue.

Magnoline could significantly affect these metabolic biomarkers to disrupt the growth and proliferation of the prostate cancer cell line 22RV1. Additionally, through MetPA analysis indicated that these biomarkers were closely correlated with a variety of metabolic pathways in tumor cells, including the energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, most of which were associated with nutrition and energy metabolism.

Patients and methods:   Our NCHT protocol involved complete androgen blockade followed by 6 cycles of docetaxel (30 mg/m2) plus estramustine phosphate (560 mg). NCHT was provided to 60 patients with PCa before RP, and we compared the clinical and pathologic outcomes with those of 349 patients with high-risk PCa who underwent RP alone using propensity score matching. The data for those who underwent RP alone were obtained from the Michinoku Japan Urological Cancer Study Group database.  Results:   In the NCHT group, 10.0% experienced pathologic complete response, 3.3% had positive surgical margins, and 13.3% developed severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher) after RP. The median follow-up duration was 42.5 months, and the 5-year biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival was 60.1%. In multivariate analysis, pN+ was an independent prognostic factor for BCR (hazard ratio = 5.251, 95%CI 1.300-21.201; P = .020). In propensity score matching, the BCR rate in the NCHT group was significantly lower than that in the RP alone group (P = .021).

Objective:   To evaluate the utility of both a cell cycle progression (CCP) score and a clinical cell-cycle risk (CCR) score to predict clinical outcomes in a large cohort of men with prostate cancer highly enriched in an AA patient population.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients were diagnosed with clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate and treated at The Ochsner Clinic (New Orleans, LA, USA) from January 2006 to December 2011. CCP scores were derived from archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy tissue. CCR scores were calculated as the combination of molecular (CCP score) and clinical (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment [CAPRA] score) components.  Intervention:   Active treatment (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy alone, or radiation and hormone therapy) or watchful waiting.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was progression to metastatic disease. Association with outcomes was evaluated via Cox proportional hazards survival analysis and likelihood ratio tests.  Results and limitations:   The final cohort included 767 men, of whom 281 (36.6%) were AA. After accounting for ancestry, treatment, and CAPRA in multivariable analysis, the CCP score remained a significant predictor of metastatic disease (hazard ratio [HR] 2.04; p<0.001), and there was no interaction with ancestry (p=0.20) or treatment (p=0.09). The CCR score was highly prognostic (HR 3.86; p<0.001), and as with the CCP score, there was no interaction with ancestry (p=0.24) or treatment (p=0.32). Limitations include the retrospective study design and the use of self-reported ancestry information.  Conclusions:   A CCR score provided significant prognostic information regardless of ancestry. The findings demonstrate that AA men in this study cohort appear to have similar prostate cancer outcomes to non-AA patients after accounting for all available molecular and clinicopathologic variables.  Patient summary:   In this study we evaluated the ability of a combined molecular and clinical score to predict the progression of localized prostate cancer. We found that the combined molecular and clinical score predicted progression to metastasis regardless of patient ancestry or treatment. This suggests that the combined molecular and clinical score may be a valuable tool for determining the risk of metastasis in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer in order to make appropriate treatment decisions.""","""['Daniel J Canter', 'Julia Reid', 'Maria Latsis', 'Margaret Variano', 'Shams Halat', 'Saradha Rajamani', 'Kristen E Gurtner', 'Zaina Sangale', 'Michael Brawer', 'Steven Stone', 'Stephen Bardot']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Analysis of the prognostic utility of the cell cycle progression (CCP) score generated from needle biopsy in men treated with definitive therapy.', 'A Biopsy-based 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score as a Predictor of Metastases and Prostate Cancer Death in Surgically Treated Men with Clinically Localized Disease.', 'Prognostic capabilities and clinical utility of cell cycle progression testing, prostate imaging reporting and data system, version 2, and clinicopathologic data in management of localized prostate cancer.', 'Prolaris Cell Cycle Progression Test for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Prognostic Value of the Cell Cycle Progression Score in Patients with Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Ancestry: How researchers use it and what they mean by it.', 'Racial disparities in prostate cancer among black men: epidemiology and outcomes.', 'Validation of the cell cycle progression score to differentiate indolent from aggressive prostate cancer in men diagnosed through transurethral resection of the prostate biopsy.', 'Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.', 'Active Surveillance in Prostate Cancer: Role of Available Biomarkers in Daily Practice.']"""

Motivated by the original study conducted by Cockburn et al. (2011) that investigated the relationship between exposure to pesticides and prostate carcinogenesis, a set of cluster-based individually matched case-control designs is presented for cost-efficient sampling of additional controls. Based on cluster sampling from the field of survey sampling, the case-control study designs presented, where one case is individually matched to three controls, use case-control status in the sampling of the primary sampling clusters. In the secondary stage, interviewer travel costs are reduced by subsampling additional controls within primary sampling clusters as opposed to selecting additional controls purely at random, which would be highly inefficient from a cost perspective. Compared to the simple random sampling (SRS) 1:1 and SRS 1:3 (one case matched to: n SRS control(s)) designs, computer simulations demonstrate that these cluster-based designs provide unbiased rate ratio estimation and statistical efficiencies that are no worse than the SRS 1:1 design and moderately less than the SRS 1:3 design. Even under situations where the intracluster correlation for the exposure variable is extremely high for the exposure of interest, the cluster-based designs have statistical efficiencies that are comparable to that of the SRS 1:1 design. Furthermore, a cost-efficiency analysis is presented that demonstrates that the cluster-based designs are more cost-efficient compared to the SRS 1:3 design.""","""['Thomas Ly', 'Myles Cockburn', 'Bryan Langholz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol""","""['Sampling designs for xerophthalmia prevalence surveys.', 'Efficiency of adaptive cluster sampling for estimating plant disease incidence.', 'Evaluation of the EPI survey methodology for estimating relative risk.', 'Spatially balanced sampling designs for environmental surveys.', 'A Proposed Hybrid Sampling Frame for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Final Report Internet.']"""

Cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) can be symptomatic prior to other manifestations directly related to malignant tumors. The aim of this study was to show that, in selected cases, ophthalmic findings are consistent enough with the diagnosis of CAR to trigger investigations aimed at detecting a previously unknown malignancy.  Methods:   This was a monocentric retrospective case series performed in a tertiary referral center. Patients with a diagnosis of CAR were included. Diagnosis was based on the clinical presentation, the visual field and electroretinogram alterations. The clinical presentation, visual field testing and electroretinographic results were analyzed as well as the malignancies identified following the diagnosis of CAR. Follow-up data was collected.  Results:   Four patients (two men, two women, median age 65.5 years) were included. All patients presented with posterior segment inflammation at initial presentation as well as advanced visual field loss and an extinguished electroretinogram. The best corrected decimal visual acuity was 0.8 or better in both eyes of three patients and decreased to 0.3 OD and O.2 OS in one patient due to a bilateral macular edema. No patient had a previously known history of cancer. Once the diagnosis of CAR was made, investigations aimed at identifying a malignant tumors subsequently led to the diagnosis of two cases of small cell lung tumors, of one prostate carcinoma and of a uterine sarcoma. The treatment of CAR included plasmapheresis, systemic corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclosporine and periocular or intraocular corticosteroid injections. In all cases the intraocular inflammation resolved, but pigment mottling, diffuse retinal atrophy, optic disc pallor and arterial narrowing were among manifestations observed during the follow-up of the patients.

LRIG3 was overexpressed or under-expressed by the rAd and siRNA to determine the effect of LRIG3 on PC and explore the possible mechanism. The mRNA and protein levels of LRIG3 were tested by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis, viability, migration and invasion were measured using MTT assay, flow cytometry and Transwell assay respectively. We observed that LRIG3 mRNA and protein levels were decreased in PC-3 cells. PC-3 cells treated with rAd-LRIG3 exhibited significantly increased cell apoptosis while inhibited viability, adhesion, migration and invasion. However, C4-2 cells treated with siRNA-LRIG3 showed reciprocal results. In conclusion, these data of the current study indicated that overexpressed LRIG3 gene expression might inhibit the viability, adhesion, invasion and migration and promote the apoptosis of PC cells. rAd-mediated LRIG3 may facilitate a novel aspect of the treatment of patients suffering from with PC.""","""['Ying Chen', 'Qing Wang', 'Mi Wang', 'Ming Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Biol Macromol""","""['miR-196a targeting LRIG3 promotes the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer cells.', 'Small interference RNA-mediated silencing of prostate stem cell antigen attenuates growth, reduces migration and invasion of human prostate cancer PC-3M cells.', 'Silencing of ezrin gene inhibits proliferation and invasion of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'LRIGs: A Prognostically Significant Family with Emerging Therapeutic Competence against Cancers.', 'The Oncogenic Potential of the Centromeric Border Protein FAM84B of the 8q24.21 Gene Desert.', 'Cardiac copper content and its relationship with heart physiology: Insights based on quantitative genetic and functional analyses using BXD family mice.', 'The Prognostic Role of LRIG Proteins in Endometrial Cancer.', 'LRIG3 Suppresses Angiogenesis by Regulating the PI3K/AKT/VEGFA Signaling Pathway in Glioma.', 'Long non-coding RNA NORAD induces cell proliferation and migration in prostate cancer.']"""

This work seeks to identify metrics which can be applied to mitigate these effects in treatment optimisation, and quantify their effectiveness. Three different metrics-dose, dose × LET and an LET-weighted dose defined as [Formula: see text] where [Formula: see text] is the dose-averaged LET-were compared with in vitro experimental studies of proton RBE and clinical treatment plans incorporating RBE models. In each system the biological effects of protons were plotted against these metrics to quantify the degree of variation introduced by unaccounted-for RBE uncertainties. As expected, the LET-dependence of RBE introduces significant variability in the biological effects of protons when plotted against dose alone. Plotting biological effects against dose × LET significantly over-estimated the impact of LET on cell survival, and typically produced even larger spreads in biological effect. LET-weighted dose was shown to have superior correlation to biological effect in both experimental data and clinical plans. For prostate and medulloblastoma treatment plans, the average RBE-associated variability in biological effect is ±5% of the prescribed dose, but is reduced to less than 1% using LET-weighting. While not a replacement for full RBE models, simplified metrics such as this LET-weighted dose can be used to account for the majority of variability which arises from the LET-dependence of RBE with reduced need for biological parameterisation. These metrics may be used to identify regions in normal tissues which may see unexpectedly high effects due to end-of-range elevations of RBE, or as part of a more general tool for biological optimisation in proton therapy.""","""['Stephen J McMahon', 'Harald Paganetti', 'Kevin M Prise']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Exploration and application of phenomenological RBE models for proton therapy.', 'Variable RBE in proton therapy: comparison of different model predictions and their influence on clinical-like scenarios.', 'A systematic review of clinical studies on variable proton Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE).', 'Relative Biological Effectiveness Uncertainties and Implications for Beam Arrangements and Dose Constraints in Proton Therapy.', 'Incidence of Rib Fracture following Treatment with Proton Therapy for Breast Cancer.', 'Linear Energy Transfer and Relative Biological Effectiveness Investigation of Various Structures for a Cohort of Proton Patients With Brain Tumors.', 'Quantification of biological range uncertainties in patients treated at the Krakow proton therapy centre.', 'How can we consider variable RBE and LETd prediction during clinical practice?

The objective of this study was to determine whether Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) ACO enrollment was associated with changes in screening for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers.  Methods:   The authors built a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries from 2006 through 2014 comprising 39,218,652 person-years of observation before and 17,252,345 person-years of observation after MSSP enrollment. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services attribution methodology was recapitulated; and screening services were identified for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer, implementing both sensitive and specific definitions of cancer screening. Adjusted difference-in-differences analyses were performed using linear regression to characterize changes in annual screening rates after ACO enrollment relative to contemporaneous changes in a non-ACO control group of Medicare beneficiaries.  Results:   Medicare beneficiaries attributed to ACO-enrolled providers had higher rates of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening before enrollment. A 1.8% relative reduction in breast cancer screening was observed among women attributed to ACO providers (P < .0001), a 2.4% relative increase was observed in colorectal cancer screening (P = .0259), and a 3.4% relative reduction was observed in prostate cancer screening among men attributed to ACO providers (P = .0025) compared with contemporaneous changes in non-ACO controls.  Conclusions:   Small-magnitude reductions were observed in breast and prostate cancer screening rates, and a small increase was observed in colorectal cancer screening associated with ACO enrollment.

We compare the dose prediction accuracy of 3 prediction methods including statistical voxel dose learning, spectral regression, and support vector regression based on limited patient training data.  Methods:   Statistical voxel dose learning, spectral regression, and support vector regression were used to predict the dose of noncoplanar intensity-modulated radiation therapy (4π) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy head and neck, 4π lung, and volumetric-modulated arc therapy prostate plans. Twenty cases of each site were used for k-fold cross-validation, with k = 4. Statistical voxel dose learning bins voxels according to their Euclidean distance to the planning target volume and uses the median to predict the dose of new voxels. Distance to the planning target volume, polynomial combinations of the distance components, planning target volume, and organ at risk volume were used as features for spectral regression and support vector regression. A total of 28 features were included. Principal component analysis was performed on the input features to test the effect of dimension reduction. For the coplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy plans, separate models were trained for voxels within the same axial slice as planning target volume voxels and voxels outside the primary beam. The effect of training separate models for each organ at risk compared to all voxels collectively was also tested. The mean squared error was calculated to evaluate the voxel dose prediction accuracy.  Results:   Statistical voxel dose learning using separate models for each organ at risk had the lowest root mean squared error for all sites and modalities: 3.91 Gy (head and neck 4π), 3.21 Gy (head and neck volumetric-modulated arc therapy), 2.49 Gy (lung 4π), and 2.35 Gy (prostate volumetric-modulated arc therapy). Compared to using the original features, principal component analysis reduced the 4π prediction error for head and neck spectral regression (-43.9%) and support vector regression (-42.8%) and lung support vector regression (-24.4%) predictions. Principal component analysis was more effective in using all/most of the possible principal components. Separate organ at risk models were more accurate than training on all organ at risk voxels in all cases.  Conclusion:   Compared with more sophisticated parametric machine learning methods with dimension reduction, statistical voxel dose learning is more robust to patient variability and provides the most accurate dose prediction method.""","""['Angelia Landers', 'Ryan Neph', 'Fabien Scalzo', 'Dan Ruan', 'Ke Sheng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Predicting liver SBRT eligibility and plan quality for VMAT and 4π plans.', '4π noncoplanar stereotactic body radiation therapy for centrally located or larger lung tumors.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'The application of artificial intelligence in the IMRT planning process for head and neck cancer.', 'Automation in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning-a review of recent innovations.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.', 'A Review on Application of Deep Learning Algorithms in External Beam Radiotherapy Automated Treatment Planning.', 'Balancing accuracy and interpretability of machine learning approaches for radiation treatment outcomes modeling.', 'Radiotherapy Treatment Planning in the Age of AI: Are We Ready Yet?', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning: Present and Future.']"""

Methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on 208 Japanese patients with T1-4N0M0 prostate cancer, who underwent definitive IG-IMRT from 2006 to 2010 at our single institution. The median dose was 78 Gy (74-78) and median ADT time was 32 months (6-151). The risk stratification followed the National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria. A biochemical relapse was defined as nadir plus 2.0 ng/mL. Toxicity was scored with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group morbidity scale.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 102 months. For low-, intermediate-, high-, and very-high-risk groups, the 10-year biochemical disease-free survival rates were 100%, 84%, 90%, and 72%, respectively (P = 0.008); clinical relapse-free survival rates were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 81%, respectively (P < 0.001); and cancer-specific survival rates were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 89%, respectively (P = 0.13).

However, anthropomorphic MR-compatible phantoms are currently limited. This work describes the development and evaluation of a custom-designed, modular, pelvic end-to-end (PETE) MR-compatible phantom to benchmark MR-only and MR-IGRT workflows. For construction considerations, subject data were assessed for phantom/skeletal geometry and internal organ kinematics to simulate average male pelvis anatomy. Various materials for the bone, bladder, and rectum were evaluated for utility within the phantom. Once constructed, PETE underwent CT-SIM, MR-Linac, and MR-SIM imaging to qualitatively assess organ visibility. Scans were acquired with various bladder and rectal volumes to assess component interactions, filling capabilities, and filling reproducibility via volume and centroid differences. PETE simulates average male pelvis anatomy and comprises an acrylic body oval (height/width = 23.0/38.1 cm) and a cast-mold urethane skeleton, with silicone balloons simulating bladder and rectum, a silicone sponge prostate, and hydrophilic poly(vinyl alcohol) foam to simulate fat/tissue separation between organs. Access ports enable retrofitting the phantom with other inserts including point/film-based dosimetry options. Acceptable contrast was achievable in CT-SIM and MR-Linac images. However, the bladder was challenging to distinguish from background in CT-SIM. The desired contrast for T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR-SIM (dark and bright bladders, respectively) was achieved. Rectum and bone exhibited no MR signal. Inputted volumes differed by <5 and <10 mL from delineated rectum (CT-SIM) and bladder (MR-SIM) volumes. Increasing bladder and rectal volumes induced organ displacements and shape variations. Reproduced volumes differed by <4.5 mL, with centroid displacements <1.4 mm. A point dose measurement with an MR-compatible ion chamber in an MR-Linac was within 1.5% of expected. A novel, modular phantom was developed with suitable materials and properties that accurately and reproducibly simulate status changes with multiple dosimetry options.

UII-R was evaluated in prostate biopsies with immunohistochemical staining, resulting in a granular cytoplasmic positivity, through automated system using the kit Urotensin II Receptor Detection System provided by Pharmabullet srl. Immunostained slides were independently and blindly evaluated by ten uro-pathologists. To evaluate UTII-R expression three different parameters were considered: localization, granules dimensions and intensity of expression. A score from 0 to 3 was applied to each parameter to obtain a score from 0 to 9. Each parameter and the total score were evaluated as predictors of high grade disease on surgical pathology and of advanced stage disease. Accuracy of total score for the prediction of upgrading and upstaging was analyzed using receiver operator characteristics curve and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   On radical prostatectomy 92/140 (66%) presented high grade disease on surgical pathology. Patients with high grade disease presented an apical distribution of the receptor, larger granules and a more intense expression when compared to patients with low grade disease. A well they presented a higher total score. Subscores and total scores were found to be predictors of upgrading and upstaging. On ROC analysis total score presented an AUC of 0.72 and 0.70, respectively, for the prediction of upgrading and upstaging.

The complexity of sexual health problems in prostate cancer survivors is underestimated or often reduced to the erectile dysfunction. Especially, factors influencing sexual desire of patients have to be more explored. This study aims to describe the therapeutic management of patients with prostate cancer and assess their sexual desire 2 years after diagnosis.  Methods:   This study is part of the National VICAN survey (Vie après le CANcer) implemented in France in 2012. This analysis was performed on a population of 414 men who had prostate cancer. The questionnaire dealt with several topics including socioeconomic status, treatments received, and sexual desire.  Results:   Prostatectomy (42.8%), radiotherapy + hormonotherapy (17.6%), and radiotherapy alone (12.8%) were the main treatments used. 41.3% of men stated that their sexual desire was all gone since disease. The ""satisfying"" perceived financial situation was significantly associated to a sexual desire loss (p = 0.008). Radiotherapy + hormonotherapy treatment only is significantly associated with a loss of sexual desire (P = 0.003).  Conclusions:   Two years after diagnosis, the sexual desire of prostate cancer survivors is deteriorated with the cancer experience. However, clinical characteristics do not seem to be decisive unlike a ""satisfying"" financial situation. Research about the impact of socio economics characteristics on sexual health should probably be engaged.

CRPC development relies on androgen receptor (AR) signaling. The IL6/STAT3 pathway is also a key driver of CRPC. The crosstalk between IL6/STAT3 and the AR pathways provides opportunities to explore next-generation agents to treat PCa. Through screening of around 600 natural compounds in our newly established prostate tumorigenesis model, potential STAT3 signaling inhibitors were found and additionally examined for effects on AR signaling. The small molecular compound 154 exhibited dual effects on IL6/STAT3 and AR pathways. We show here that compound 154 inhibits AR and STAT3 transcriptional activity, reduces the expression of phosphorylation of STAT3 (Y705) and downregulates the mRNA levels of AR target genes. Compound 154 also inhibits protein expression of AR and AR splice variants (ARv567es and AR-V7) without altering AR mRNA levels. Compound 154 binds to AR directly, but not to STAT3 and is identified as an antagonist of the AR amino-terminal domain (NTD) by disrupting protein-protein interactions between STAT3 and the AR NTD. Moreover, compound 154 does not reduce AR nuclear translocation.

Repeated assessments are required to take into account symptom fluctuation and de novo symptom appearance. The study objective was to evaluate mortality in relation to three urinary storage symptoms-urgency, daytime frequency, and nocturia-in middle-aged and elderly men, considering also other time-varying factors during follow-up.  Methods:   A mail survey of a population-based cohort of men initially aged 50, 60, and 70 years was conducted in Finland in 1994, 1999, 2004, and 2009. The questionnaire included assessments of LUTS based on the Danish Prostatic Symptom Score and comorbidities. The men were followed up for mortality through the population registry through 2014. LUTS-related hazard ratios (HR) were analyzed with time-dependent Cox regression adjusted for the year of birth and comorbidities using variable values updated every 5 years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using values of all variables fixed to the baseline assessment of 1994.  Results:   Of the 1332 eligible men with data on LUTS from each preceding survey, 514 (38.6%) died during the 21-year follow-up. In time-dependent analyses, daytime frequency, and nocturia were significantly associated with increased mortality: the adjusted HR was 1.42 (95% CI 1.11-1.83) for daytime frequency, 1.38 (1.07-1.79) for nocturia and 1.19 (0.94-1.50) for urgency. In sensitivity analyses with fixed baseline characteristics, only nocturia was suggestively associated with an increased risk of death: the adjusted HR was 1.09 (0.84-1.42) for daytime frequency, 1.41 (0.99-2.02) for nocturia and 0.94 (0.52-1.68) for urgency.  Conclusions:   Among aging men, LUTS are more accurate predictors of short-term than longer-term mortality risk.

Typically, the optimal patient position is determined based on anatomical landmarks or implanted markers. In the presence of non-rigid anatomical changes, however, the planning scenario cannot be exactly reproduced and positioning should rather aim at finding the optimal position in terms of the actually applied dose. In this work, dose-guided patient alignment, implemented as multicriterial optimization (MCO) problem, was investigated in the scope of intensity-modulated and double-scattered PT (IMPT and DSPT) for the first time. A method for automatically determining the optimal patient position with respect to pre-defined clinical goals was implemented. Linear dose interpolation was used to access a continuous space of potential patient shifts. Fourteen head and neck (H&N) and eight prostate cancer patients with up to five repeated CTs were included. Dose interpolation accuracy was evaluated and the potential dosimetric advantages of dose-guided over bony-anatomy-based patient alignment investigated by comparison of clinically relevant target and organ-at-risk (OAR) dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters. Dose interpolation was found sufficiently accurate with average pass-rates of 90% and 99% for an exemplary H&N and prostate patient, respectively, using a 2% dose-difference criterion. Compared to bony-anatomy-based alignment, the main impact of automated MCO-based dose-guided positioning was a reduced dose to the serial OARs (spinal cord and brain stem) for the H&N cohort. For the prostate cohort, under-dosage of the target structures could be efficiently diminished. Limitations of dose-guided positioning were mainly found in reducing target over-dosage due to weight loss for H&N patients, which might require adaptation of the treatment plan.

The Impact of Nodal Burden on Long-term Outcomes""","""Background:   A role for local therapies including radical prostatectomy (RP) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients with clinical lymphadenopathies has been proposed. However, no data are available to identify men who would benefit from RP in this setting.  Objective:   To identify predictors of clinical recurrence (CR) in surgically managed PCa patients with clinical lymphadenopathies.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified 162 patients with lymphadenopathies treated with RP and lymph node dissection at three referral centers.  Outcome measures and statistical analyses:   CR was defined as the onset of metastases detected by conventional imaging. Kaplan-Maier analyses assessed time to CR after stratifying patients according to the site of lymphadenopathies and nodal burden. Regression tree analysis stratified patients into risk groups on the basis of their preoperative characteristics.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 80% of patients had lymphadenopathies in the pelvis alone and 20% in the retroperitoneum±pelvis. The median size of positive nodes was 13mm. A total of 84 patients (52%) received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and 127 (78%) had pathological lymph node invasion. The median follow-up for survivors was 64 mo. The 8-yr CR-free and CSM-free survival rates were 59% and 80%, respectively. Biopsy grade group and preoperative nodal burden should identify patients more likely to experience CR. While <10% of men with biopsy grade group 1-3 and two or fewer clinical lymphadenopathies developed CR, up to 60% of patients with biopsy grade group 4-5 and retroperitoneal node involvement ultimately experienced CR at 8 yr after RP. The discrimination of the regression tree was 76% according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Our study is limited by potential unmeasured confounders and the relatively small sample size.  Conclusions:   Surgery in a multimodal setting might play a role in PCa patients with biopsy grade group 1-3 and/or enlarged nodes in the pelvis. Conversely, grade group 4-5 PCa and lymphadenopathies in the retroperitoneum are associated with worse oncologic outcomes.  Patient summary:   Approximately half of prostate cancer patients with clinical lymphadenopathies treated with radical prostatectomy are free from metastases at 8-yr follow-up. Radical prostatectomy with or without systemic therapies might play a role in selected patients with biopsy grade group 1-3 disease and/or enlarged nodes in the pelvis. Conversely, a higher grade group and the presence of lymphadenopathies in the retroperitoneum should identify candidates for systemic therapies upfront.""","""['Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Matteo Soligo', 'Antonino Battaglia', 'Tim Muilwijk', 'Daniele Robesti', 'Elio Mazzone', 'Francesco Barletta', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Marco Moschini', 'Marco Bandini', 'Steven Joniau', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Long-term outcomes of salvage lymph node dissection for clinically recurrent prostate cancer: results of a single-institution series with a minimum follow-up of 5 years.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Pelvic/retroperitoneal salvage lymph node dissection for patients treated with radical prostatectomy with biochemical recurrence and nodal recurrence detected by 11Ccholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography.', 'The role of radical prostatectomy and lymph node dissection in lymph node-positive prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Impact of non-regional lymph node metastases accurately revealed on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in the clinical management of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Challenging cases in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Narrative review of management strategies and outcomes in node-positive prostate cancer.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in high-risk prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Radical Prostatectomy and Lymph Node Dissection in Clinically Node Positive Patients.']"""

In past years, this class of compounds has been classified as an attractive and novel family of anticancer agents. Pantinin peptides isolated from scorpion Pandinus imperator presented antimicrobial activity. In this study, we have explored the in vitro antitumor activity of antimicrobial pantinin peptides against the tumor cell lines MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma) and DU - 145 (prostate adenocarcinoma) and healthy fibroblasts HGF - 1. To further improve our mechanistic understanding for this class of compounds, we have also performed a biophysical characterization of these peptides in lipid model membranes. Cell viability assays revealed that all peptides were more effective on tumor cells when compared to fibroblasts, indicating selectivity towards cancer cells. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis revealed that all peptides induced apoptosis in cancer cells in a different way from fibroblasts. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that all peptides adopted an α-helical structure and an evaluation of the binding constant indicates a higher affinity of the peptides to negatively charged phospholipids. Additionally, permeabilization assays showed that POPG and POPS anionic vesicles were more susceptible to peptide-induced lysis than POPC:Chol and POPC:POPE vesicles. Moreover, we have observed that increasing concentrations of cholesterol inhibits peptide binding process.

At follow up after treatment, men had their PSA measured and were scored for urinary, bowel and sexual side effects. RESULTS: Median follow-up of men was 7.9 years (range 2.0-16.3 years). Ten-year PSA control was 95% for the 551 men with low-risk prostate cancer and 82% for the 400 men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Adverse effects were generally minor and short-term only. Temporary urinary obstruction developed soon after the implant in 2.6% men, and the 10-year cumulative risk of urethral stricture was 2.6%. Erectile dysfunction developed in 29% men, two-thirds of whom had a good response to a PDE5 inhibitor. Most men returned to a normal routine within four days of the implant.

Hence, there is an urgent need for other tools to accurately identify patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa).  Patients:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 260 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and were eligible for AS according to the following criteria: clinical stage T2a or less, prostate-specific antigen level < 10 ng/mL, 2 or fewer cores involved with cancer, Gleason score (GS) ≤6 grade, and prostate-specific antigen density < 0.2 ng/mL/cc.  Methods:   Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the association of patient and tumor characteristics with reclassification, defined as upstaged (pathological stage >pT2) and upgraded (GS ≥7) disease. A base model (age, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, and clinical stage) was compared with models considering neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) or platelets to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte to lymphocyte (MLR), and eosinophil to lymphocyte ratio (ELR). OR and 95% CI were calculated. Finally, a decision curve analysis was performed.  Results:   Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that NLR, PLR, and ELR upgrading were significantly associated with upgrading (ORs ranging from 2.13 to 4.13), but not with upstaging except for MLR in multivariate analysis, showing a protective effect.

We hypothesized that the molecular pathways involved in the response of melanocytes to ionizing radiation and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are similar. Skin punch biopsies, not sun-exposed, were collected from prostate cancer patients before, as well as at 1 and 6.5 weeks after daily doses of 0.05-1.1 Gy. Interfollicular melanocytes were identified by ΔNp63- and eosin-periodic acid Schiff staining. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed to detect molecular markers of the melanocyte lineage. Melanocytes were negative for ΔNp63, and the number remained unchanged over the treatment period. At radiation doses as low as 0.05 Gy, melanocytes express higher protein levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and Bcl-2. Subsets of MITF- and Bcl-2-negative melanocytes were identified among interfollicular melanocytes in unexposed skin; the cell number in both subsets was reduced after irradiation in a way that indicates low-dose hyperradiosensitivity. A corresponding increase in MITF- and Bcl-2-positive cells was observed. PAX3 and SOX10 co-localized to some extent with MITF in unexposed skin, more so with radiation exposure. Low doses of ionizing radiation also intensified c-KIT and DCT staining. Nuclear p53 and p21 were undetectable in melanocytes. Apoptosis and proliferation could not be observed. In conclusion, undifferentiated interfollicular melanocytes were identified, and responded with differentiation in a hypersensitive manner at 0.05 Gy doses. Radioresistance regarding cell death was maintained up to fractionated doses of 1.1 Gy, applied for 7 weeks.

Methods: 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was synthetized by IBA Molecular (Somerset, NJ, USA) and transported by air to Tsukuba Molecular Imaging Center (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan).17 patients received 74 MBq (2 mCi) of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M at total mass doses of 10 mg. Whole-body and plasma clearance, normal-organ and lesion uptake, and radiation absorbed dose were estimated. We also preliminarily tested the performance of 89Zr-immuno-PET imaging for 13 patients with prostate cancer and 4 patients with other urological cancer.  Results:   The administration of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was well-tolerated, and no infusion-related reactions were observed in any patient. No adverse events were noted in the laboratory parameters, vital signs, or other parameters. The plasma clearance was biphasic, with an initial rapid phase (t 1/2 fast: 10.1 ± 3.4 h) followed by a slow phase (t 1/2 slow: 49.0 ± 22.7 h). The half-life of radioactivity in the whole body (WB t1/2) was 237 ± 9 h. The highest absorbed radiation dose was 1.67 mGy/MBq, observed in the liver and kidney. The effective dose was 0.68 ± 0.08 mSv/MBq. The radiation dose rate at 0.5 m distance from the patient was 8.67 µSv/h on day 1, and decreased to 2.26 µSv/h at 5 days after injection. Both bone and lymph node metastases were detected with 89Zr-Df-IAB2M by 24 or 48 h imaging.  Conclusions:   Administration of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M was well-tolerated and safe in terms of adverse events and radiation exposure and protection. 89Zr-Df-IAB2M is feasible for usage by long-distance transportation.

Only few studies [2-5] evaluate the surgical outcome of patients with inguinal hernias after radical prostatectomy, using the TAPP or TEP procedure. But controversies remain including its feasibility, safety and recurrence rate. The mesh size to be used and the necessity of a complete dissection of the scared retropubic space are discussed controversially. Long-term follow-up studies are missing.Methods After introducing the technique of a laparoscopic transperitoneal endoscopic hernioplasty (TAPP) at the hospital in October 1992, this approach had been recommended to all adult patients with inguinal and femoral hernias. In our single-center study, the medical records of all 5,764 patients with 7,010 inguinal and femoral hernias, operated from 1993 until 2009, were enrolled in a retrospective analysis. A TAPP procedure was performed in 6,582 hernias (Peitsch, Surg Endosc 28:671-682, 2014). During that period, 48 patients with 55 inguinal hernias on average of 3.7 years (3 months-14 years) after prior open radical retropubic prostatectomy underwent hernia surgery (92.7% TAPP). The age of these patients, time required for surgery, hernia location (medial, lateral, combined and bilateral), the perioperative (30-day complications ""Clavien Classification"") and late complications with a median postoperative follow-up time of 8.0 years (2-17 years) were analyzed and compared with the data of the control group (all TAPP procedures for inguinal and femoral hernias).Results Patients with inguinal hernias after radical open retropubic prostatectomy were older as patients of the control group (70.3 vs. 59.1 years) and the medial time required for surgery was significantly longer (72.9 vs. 41.3 min). Less frequent were bilateral inguinal hernias (25.5 vs. 35.8%), medial inguinal hernias (Hernia classification Nyhus Type 3A) with 5.5 vs. 17.9% and femoral hernias (0 vs. 4.9%). No hernia patient after radical prostatectomy and only 0.1% of the control group (n = 6582 hernias) had a conversion to an anterior open repair. One patient after radical prostatectomy needed a laparoscopic drainage of a hemato-seroma 48 h postoperatively (1/51). The rate of late postoperative complications was low. 4.8% of patients reported of groin pain and 2.4% of testicular pain longer than 28 days postoperatively. The hernia recurrence rate of 2.4% (1/42 TAPP) was not significantly different from the control group (1.8%, 16/896 hernias).Conclusions In the hands of surgeons with large experiences in endoscopic laparoscopic hernia repair, the laparoscopic transperitoneal hernioplasty (TAPP) after previous radical open retropubic prostatectomy is safe and effective with low intra- and postoperative complications and low hernia recurrences (2.4%). A TAPP technique with closure of hernia gaps larger than 1 × 1 cm with non-absorbable surgical sutures and a mesh-size of 13 × 13-15 cm is requested.

Methods:   Data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two hypofractionated RT schedules were used. Urinary (nocturia, incontinence, frequency, dysuria, and urgency) and GI (obstruction, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, bloating, hemorragia, and incontinence) symptoms measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR-25 were used for PROs. The same symptoms were scored by the physician using the Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v4.0. Outcomes were reported at baseline, end of treatment, month 1, and month 3. PROs and physician-reported outcomes were converted in two categories (0 = no symptoms; 1 = symptoms of any severity) and were correlated using the kappa (κ) correlation statistics.

However, there has been little study of GLTSCR1 in prostate cancer. In the present study, the association between the expression of GLTSCR1, and the progression and prognosis of tumors in patients with prostate cancer was assessed. An immunohistochemical analysis was performed using a human tissue microarray for GLTSCR1 at the protein expression level and the immunostaining results were evaluated against clinical variables of patients with prostate cancer. Subsequently, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to validate the analysis results at the mRNA level and to study the prognostic value of GLTSCR1 in prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry and TCGA data analysis revealed that GLTSCR1 expression in the prostate cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in the benign prostate tissues (immunoreactivity score, P=0.015; mRNA levels: cancer, 447.7±6.45 vs. benign, 343.5±4.21; P<0.001). Additionally, the increased GLTSCR1 protein expression was associated with certain clinical variables in the prostate cancer tissues, including advanced clinical stage (P<0.001), enhanced tumor invasion (P=0.003), lymph node metastasis (P=0.003) and distant metastasis (P=0.001). TCGA data revealed similar results, demonstrating that the upregulation of GLTSCR1 mRNA expression was associated with the Gleason score (P<0.001), enhanced tumor invasion (P=0.011), lymph node metastasis (P=0.001) and distant metastasis (P=0.002). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that among all patients, high GLTSCR1 expression indicated a decreased overall survival (P=0.028) and biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival (P=0.004), compared with patients with low GLTSCR1 expression. Finally, multivariate analysis revealed that the expression of GLTSCR1 was an independent predictor of poor BCR-free survival (P=0.049). The present study suggested that the increased expression of GLTSCR1 was associated with the progression of prostate cancer. Furthermore, GLTSCR1 may be a novel biomarker that is able to predict the clinical outcome in prostate cancer patients.""","""['Xiaoming Ma', 'Tao Du', 'Dingjun Zhu', 'Xianju Chen', 'Yiming Lai', 'Wanhua Wu', 'Qiong Wang', 'Chunhao Lin', 'Zean Li', 'Leyuan Liu', 'Hai Huang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Decreased expression of serine protease inhibitor family G1 (SERPING1) in prostate cancer can help distinguish high-risk prostate cancer and predicts malignant progression.', 'Elevated levels of epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 predicts poor prognosis for prostate cancer.', 'High expression of ASPM correlates with tumor progression and predicts poor outcome in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Enhanced expression of centromere protein F predicts clinical progression and prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of malignant brain tumor domain containing protein 1 predicts a poor prognosis of prostate cancer.', 'Loss of GLTSCR1 causes congenital heart defects by regulating NPPA transcription.', 'Identification of pyroptosis-related lncRNA signature and AC005253.1 as a pyroptosis-related oncogene in prostate cancer.', 'GLTSCR1 coordinates alternative splicing and transcription elongation of ZO1 to regulate colorectal cancer progression.', 'Remote ischemic post‑conditioning alleviates ischemia/reperfusion‑induced intestinal injury via the ERK signaling pathway‑mediated RAGE/HMGB axis.', 'BRD9 Is a Critical Regulator of Androgen Receptor Signaling and Prostate Cancer Progression.']"""

Methods:   The NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER), Cancer Trends Progress Report, and Funding Statistics were used to analyze 18 cancer sites. Site-specific mortality to incidence ratios (MIR) were normalized per 100 cases and multiplied by person-years of life lost to derive cancer-specific lethality. NCI funding was divided by its lethality to calculate Funding to Lethality scores for gynecologic malignancies and compared to 15 other cancer sites.  Results:   Ovarian, cervical, and uterine cancers ranked 10th (score 0.097, SD 0.008), 12th (0.087, SD 0.009), and 14th (0.057, SD 0.006) for average Funding to Lethality scores. The highest average score was for prostate cancer (score 1.182, SD 0.364). In U.S. dollars per 100 incident cases, prostate cancer received an average of $1,821,000 per person-years of life lost, while ovarian cancer received $97,000, cervical cancer $87,000, and uterine cancer $57,000. Ovarian and cervical cancers had lower average Funding to Lethality scores compared to nine other cancers, while uterine cancer was lower than 13 other cancers (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). Analyses of eight-, five-, and three-year trends for gynecologic cancers showed nearly universal decreasing Funding to Lethality scores.

Methods and materials:   Data sets containing planning CT (pCT) and CBCT images for ten patients with prostate cancer were used. Each pCT image was registered to its corresponding CBCT image using one rigid registration algorithm with mutual information similarity metric (RR-MI) and three DR algorithms with normalized correlation coefficient, mutual information and normalized mutual information (DR-NCC, DR-MI and DR-NMI, respectively). Then, the HM was performed between deformed pCT and CBCT in order to correct the distribution of the Hounsfield Units (HU) in CBCT images.  Results:   The visual assessment showed that the absolute difference between corrected CBCT and deformed pCT was reduced after correction with HM except for soft tissue-air and soft-tissue-bone interfaces due to the improper registration. Furthermore, volumes comparison in terms of average HU error showed that using DR-NCC algorithm with HM yielded the lowest error values of about 55.95 ± 10.43 HU compared to DR-MI and DR-NMI for which the errors were 58.60 ± 10.35 and 56.58 ± 10.51 HU, respectively. Tissue class's comparison by the mean absolute error (MAE) plots confirmed the performance of DR-NCC algorithm to produce corrected CBCT images with lowest values of MAE even in regions where the misalignment is more pronounced. It was also found that the used method had successfully improved the spatial uniformity in the CBCT images by reducing the root mean squared difference (RMSD) between the pCT and CBCT in fat and muscle from 57 and 25 HU to 8HU, respectively.  Conclusion:   The choice of an accurate DR algorithm before performing the HM leads to an accurate correction of CBCT images. The results suggest that applying DR process based on NCC similarity metric reduces significantly the uncertainties in CBCT images and generates images in good agreement with pCT.""","""['Halima Saadia Kidar', 'Hacene Azizi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Enhancement of Hounsfield unit distribution in cone-beam CT images for adaptive radiation therapy: Evaluation of a hybrid correction approach.', 'Quantitative cone-beam CT imaging in radiation therapy using planning CT as a prior: first patient studies.', 'A 3D global-to-local deformable mesh model based registration and anatomy-constrained segmentation method for image guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Deformable Registration for Dose Accumulation.', 'CBCT-based bone quality assessment: are Hounsfield units applicable?', 'CBCT-based synthetic CT generated using CycleGAN with HU correction for adaptive radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Daily dose evaluation based on corrected CBCTs for breast cancer patients: accuracy of dose and complication risk assessment.', 'CBCT-based synthetic CT generation using generative adversarial networks with disentangled representation.']"""

Here, the efficacy of SWL, an ephrin-mimicking peptide that binds specifically to EphrinA2 (EphA2) receptors, increased by presenting up to three of these peptides on small DNA nanostructures in an oligovalent manner. Ephrin signaling pathways play crucial roles in tumor development and progression. Moreover, Eph receptors are potential targets in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, the quantitative impact of SWL valency on binding, phosphorylation (key player for activation) and phenotype regulation in EphA2-expressing prostate cancer cells was demonstrated. EphA2 phosphorylation was significantly increased by DNA trimers carrying three SWL peptides compared to monovalent SWL. In comparison to one of EphA2's natural ligands ephrin-A1, which is known to bind promiscuously to multiple receptors, pinpointed targeting of EphA2 by oligovalent DNA-SWL constructs showed enhanced cell retraction.

Methods:   A comprehensive literature search up to March 2018 was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Summary odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with a random effects model. The Q statistic and the I2 index were used to evaluate the heterogeneity across the studies.  Results:   Eight studies were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. In the overall analysis, no significant association was found between acne and prostate cancer risk (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.93-1.25). A significant heterogeneity was observed across studies (P = 0.006, I2 = 64.5%). In the subgroup analysis by study design, a significant association was observed in the cohort studies (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.19-1.93) but not in the case-control studies (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.86-1.12).  Conclusions:   In summary, this meta-analysis did not find an association between acne in adolescence and prostate cancer risk. However, because there was some heterogeneity in the overall analysis and a significant association was observed in the meta-analysis of the cohort studies, further well-designed large prospective studies are warranted to confirm our results.""","""['Xian Zhang', 'Yi Lin', 'Xiaoning Xie', 'Meiya Shen', 'Guoping Huang', 'Yunmei Yang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Acne in late adolescence and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Reduced risk of prostate cancer in childless men as compared to fathers: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Allium vegetables and risk of prostate cancer: evidence from 132,192 subjects.', 'Legume intake and risk of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.', 'Hypertension and risk of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Crosstalk between Prostate Cancer and Microbiota Inflammation: Nutraceutical Products Are Useful to Balance This Interplay?']"""

Formalin-Fixed-Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) is a routine method for preserving tissues. However, DNA isolated from FFPE tissue is often difficult to be amplified in PCR due to fragmentation and DNA-protein crosslinks. This study aimed to optimize the DNA isolation method from FFPE tissue and compare the performance of four different PCR ready-to-use kits. Genomic DNA was isolated from FFPE tissue colon of Short-segment Hirschsprung (S-HSCR) patients and prostate cancer tissue using Quick-DNA™ FFPE Kit (Zymo Research) with and without pre-heating treatment in KOH/NOH solution. Primers for Androgen Receptor (AR) gene and four different PCR kits: MyTaq HS Red Mix 2X (BioLine), FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche), KAPA2G fast PCR Kit 2X (KAPA Biosystem) and KOD FX Neo (Toyobo) were used for amplification. DNA electrophoresis was performed to compare the PCR results. BioLine and Toyobo kits gave better PCR results than those of Roche and KAPA Biosystem. Increasing amount of Taq polymerase and dNTPs of Roche kit by two-fold could increase the quality of PCR results. Toyobo could amplify DNA up to 417 bp, however, none of these PCR kits could amplify DNA above 450 bp. Pre-heated treatment of FFPE tissue in NaOH/KOH did not improve the DNA quality and PCR results. Toyobo PCR ready-to-use kit gave the best result among the other three PCR kits used in this study in amplifying DNA isolated from FFPE tissue. Designing the primers producing amplicon not more than 450 bp is suggested.""","""['Almira Zada', 'Puspasari S Susanto', 'Raden L Putri', 'Edhyana K Sahiratmadja', 'Bethy S Hernowo', 'Andri Rezano', 'Yunia Sribudiani']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)""","""['Preparation of archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded mouse liver samples for use with the Agilent gene expression microarray platform.', 'DNA and RNA isolation from canine oncologic formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues for downstream ""-omic"" analyses: possible or not?', 'Automation of genomic DNA isolation from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.', 'Regulatory and ethical issues on the utilization of FFPE tissues in research.', 'RNA expression analysis from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues.', 'A Novel NCSTN Mutation in a Three-Generation Chinese Family with Hidradenitis Suppurative.']"""

Materials and methods:   Seventy-six patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer underwent preoperative 3-T MRI before undergoing radical prostatectomy. Two radiologists worked in consensus to mark wedge-shaped regions of hypointensity on T2-weighted images and assess their appearance on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (to determine the degree of hypointensity) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI (DCE-MRI) (to assess whether they showed early enhancement). The pathologic outcome of wedge-shaped lesions was assessed by matching MR images with whole-mount histologic specimens retrospectively. The difference in quantitative ADC values between malignant and benign wedge-shaped lesions was assessed using a t test.  Results:   Thirty-five wedge-shaped regions were identified, 12 (34%) of which were found be malignant. Most malignant wedge-shaped regions were highly hypointense (10/12; 83%) on ADC maps and showed early enhancement on DCE-MRI (7/12; 58%). However, benign wedge-shaped lesions were predominantly mildly hypointense (13/23; 57%) on ADC maps and showed no early enhancement (15/23; 65%). Histologic correlates of the benign wedge-shaped regions showed prostatitis (acute inflammation [7/23; 30%] or chronic inflammation [9/23; 39%]), hemosiderin-laden macrophages (6/23; 26%), prominent blood vessels (7/23; 30%), intraluminal blood (6/23; 26%), and nonspecific atrophy (6/23; 26%). The mean (± SD) quantitative ADC value of malignant wedge-shaped regions (1.13 ± 0.11 μm2/ms) was significantly lower (p = 0.0001) than that of benign wedge-shaped regions (1.52 ± 0.27 μm2/ms).  Conclusion:   This study shows that a greater percentage of wedge-shaped features are malignant than was previously thought. Of importance, mpMRI (specifically, ADC maps) can distinguish between malignant and benign wedge-shaped features.""","""['Aritrick Chatterjee', 'Sevil Tokdemir', 'Alexander J Gallan', 'Ambereen Yousuf', 'Tatjana Antic', 'Gregory S Karczmar', 'Aytekin Oto']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Re: Multiparametric MRI Features and Pathologic Outcome of Wedge-Shaped Lesions in the Peripheral Zone on T2-Weighted Images of the Prostate.', 'Comparison of T2-Weighted Imaging, DWI, and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Calculation of Prostate Cancer Index Lesion Volume: Correlation With Whole-Mount Pathology.', 'Revisiting quantitative multi-parametric MRI of benign prostatic hyperplasia and its differentiation from transition zone cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of normal, benign and malignant conditions in the prostate.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for transition zone prostate cancer: essential findings, limitations, and future directions.', 'Comparing Radiologist Performance in Diagnosing Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer with Multiparametric versus Hybrid Multidimensional MRI.', 'Application Value of Radiomic Nomogram in the Differential Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer and Hyperplasia.', 'Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System: Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance between Version 2.0 and 2.1 for Prostatic Peripheral Zone.']"""

Autophagy is a survival mechanism in response to nutrient depletion or organellar damage that encloses idle or damaged organelles within autophagosomes that are then delivered to lysosomes for degradation. However, the relationship between LPA and autophagy is largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to elucidate whether LPA affects autophagy through the ERK1/2 and (or) the Akt-mTOR signaling pathways. In this study, we investigated the effect of LPA on autophagy-regulating pathways in various prostate-derived cancer cells including PC3, LNCaP, and Du145 cells grown in complete medium and exposed to serum-free medium. Using Western blotting and ELISA, we determined that LPA stimulates the ERK and mTOR pathways in complete and serum-free medium. The mTOR pathway led to phosphorylation of S6K and ULK, which respectively stimulates protein synthesis and arrests autophagy. Consistent with this, LPA exposure suppressed autophagy as measured by LC3 maturation and formation of GFP-LC3 puncta. Altogether, these results suggest that LPA suffices to activate mTORC1 and suppress autophagy in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Gizem E Genc', 'Victoria E B Hipolito', 'Roberto J Botelho', 'Saadet Gumuslu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Signal transduction responses to lysophosphatidic acid and sphingosine 1-phosphate in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Lysophosphatidic acid inhibits serum deprivation-induced autophagy in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Lysophosphatidic acid induces prostate cancer PC3 cell migration via activation of LPA(1), p42 and p38alpha.', 'Dienogest enhances autophagy induction in endometriotic cells by impairing activation of AKT, ERK1/2, and mTOR.', 'Alisertib induces cell cycle arrest and autophagy and suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR and sirtuin 1-mediated signaling pathways in human pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Regulation of Autophagy via Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism in Cancer.', 'Sophocarpine inhibits tumor progression by antagonizing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Resveratrol Contrasts LPA-Induced Ovarian Cancer Cell Migration and Platinum Resistance by Rescuing Hedgehog-Mediated Autophagy.', 'Lysophosphatidic Acid Signaling in Cancer Cells: What Makes LPA So Special?', 'Changes in phospholipid metabolism in exosomes of hormone-sensitive and hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells.']"""

The SA coating fulfils two functions: SA provides a stealth coating for enhanced biocompatibility; it also acts as a targeting ligand enabling efficient tumor accumulation of SA-TMV versus TMV in mouse models of breast and prostate cancer. We demonstrate drug delivery of the chemotherapy doxorubicin (DOX); TMV-delivered DOX outperformed free DOX, resulting in significant delayed tumor growth and increased survival. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability of SA-coated TMV loaded with chelated Gd(DOTA) for magnetic resonance imaging detection of tumors. In the future, we envision the application of such probes as theranostic, where first imaging is performed to assess whether the nanoparticles are effective at targeting a particular patient tumor. If targeting is confirmed, the therapeutic would be added and treatment can begin.

In the full cohort study, we identified 1244 prostate cancer patients who had received androgen deprivation therapy as the study cohort and 1806 prostate cancer patients who did not receive androgen deprivation therapy as the comparison cohort. To eliminate potential bias, we performed a propensity score-matched cohort study. Each prostate cancer patient was tracked for 1 year from the index date to ascertain whether they were subsequently diagnosed with heart failure. In the full cohort study, incidence rates of heart failure per 100 person-years within the 1-year follow-up period were 4.00 (95%CI, 2.95-5.30) and 1.89 (95%CI, 1.30-2.66) for androgen deprivation therapy users and nonusers, respectively. In addition, the multivariable Cox regression indicated that the hazard ratio (HR) of heart failure among androgen deprivation therapy users was 1.72 (95%CI, 1.08-2.73) compared with those androgen deprivation therapy nonusers. In the propensity score-matched cohort study, the adjusted HR for heart failure among androgen deprivation therapy users was 1.92 (95%CI, 1.15-3.18) compared with propensity score-matched nonusers.

Preclinical data in prostate cancer has suggested the potential additive effect dual inhibition of VEGF and mTOR pathways. In this phase I/II trial we assessed the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with temsirolimus for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods In the phase I portion, eligible patients received temsirolimus (20 mg or 25 mg IV weekly) in combination with a fixed dose of IV bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). The primary endpoint for the phase II portion was objective response measured by either PSA or RECIST criteria. Exploratory endpoints included changes in circulating tumor cells (CTC) and their correlation with PSA response to treatment. Results Twenty-one patients, median age 64 (53-82), with pre-treatment PSA of 205.3 (11.1-1801.0), previously treated with a median of 2 (0-5) lines of therapy for mCRPC received the combination of temsirolimus weekly at 20 mg (n = 4) or 25 mg (n = 17) with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n = 21). Median time to progression was 2.6 months (95% CI, 1.2-3.9) and the median best PSA change from baseline to 12 weeks was a 32% increase (-40-632%) which met the predefined futility rule and led to early termination of the study. Nine patients (43%) had ≥ grade 3 toxicity that included fatigue (24%), anorexia (10%), nausea/vomiting (5%) and lymphopenia (5%). In exploratory analysis, a decrease in CTC levels was observed in 9 out of 11 patients. No association between PSA levels and CTC levels was detected. Conclusions The combination of temsirolimus and bevacizumab showed limited clinical activity in mCRPC patients previously treated with chemotherapy and was associated with significant adverse events (AEs).

While patients may achieve undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after RARP, the risk of disease progression is relatively high. We investigated metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) outcomes and prognosticators in such patients.  Methods:   In a single-center cohort of 342 patients with high-risk PCa (clinical stage ≥ T3, biopsy Gleason score ≥ 8, and/or PSA levels ≥ 20 ng/mL) treated with RARP and pelvic lymph node dissection between August 2005 and June 2011, we identified 251 (73.4%) patients (median age, 66.5 years; interquartile range [IQR], 63.0-71.0 years) who achieved undetectable PSA levels (< 0.01 ng/mL) postoperatively. Survival outcomes were evaluated for the entire study sample and in groups stratified according to the time to biochemical recurrence dichotomized at 60 months.  Results:   During the median follow-up of 75.9 months (IQR, 59.4-85.8 months), metastasis occurred in 38 (15.1%) patients, most often to the bones, followed by the lymph nodes, lungs, and liver. The 5-year metastasis-free, cancer-specific, and OS rates were 87.1%, 94.8%, and 94.3%, respectively. Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed time to recurrence as an independent predictor of metastasis (P < 0.001). Time to metastasis was an independent predictor of OS (P = 0.003). Metastasis-free and CSS rates were significantly lower among patients with recurrence within 60 months of RARP (log-rank P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   RARP confers acceptable oncological outcomes for high-risk PCa. Close monitoring beyond 5 years is warranted for early detection of disease progression and for timely adjuvant therapy.""","""['Do Kyung Kim', 'Kyo Chul Koo', 'Kwang Suk Lee', 'Yoon Soo Hah', 'Koon Ho Rha', 'Sung Joon Hong', 'Byung Ha Chung']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Korean Med Sci""","""['Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes in patients with clinically high-risk prostate cancer treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results from a multi-institutional study of 1100 patients.', 'Small-volume lymph node involvement and biochemical recurrence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with extended lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Clinicopathological and oncological significance of persistent prostate-specific antigen after radical prostatectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Assessment of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer (Review).']"""

Expressed on the cancer cell surface, STEAP1 is an attractive target for antibody-based therapy or immunotherapy. However, its role in modulating the pathophysiology of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we first demonstrated that the STEAP1 transcript level was significantly higher in CRC tissues than in normal colonic tissues. Of note, STEAP1 expression negatively correlated with overall survival as determined from a publicly accessible gene expression profile data set. A loss-of-function approach in cultured CRC cell lines revealed that STEAP1 silencing suppressed cell growth and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, followed by apoptosis, through an intrinsic pathway. Mechanistically, the inhibition of STEAP1 was associated with decreased expression of antioxidant molecules regulated by the transcription factor, nuclear erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2), in CRC cells. Taken together, we identified high STEAP1 transcript levels leading to reduced ROS production that prevented apoptosis via the NRF2 pathway in CRC cells as a pathological mechanism in CRC.

Whereas up-regulation of MET expression has been observed in aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer, a clear understanding of MET function in prostate tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here, we developed a conditional Met transgenic mouse strain, H11Met/+:PB-Cre4, to mimic human prostate cancer cells with increased MET expression in the prostatic luminal epithelium. We found that these mice develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia after HGF administration. To further assess the biological role of MET in prostate cancer progression, we bred H11Met/+/PtenLoxP/LoxP:PBCre4 compound mice, in which transgenic Met expression and deletion of the tumor suppressor gene Pten occurred simultaneously only in prostatic epithelial cells. These compound mice exhibited accelerated prostate tumor formation and invasion as well as increased metastasis compared with PtenLoxP/LoxP:PB-Cre4 mice. Moreover, prostatic sarcomatoid carcinomas and lesions resembling the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition developed in tumor lesions of the compound mice. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analyses revealed a robust enrichment of known tumor progression and metastasis-promoting genes in samples isolated from H11Met/+/PtenLoxP/LoxP:PB-Cre4 compound mice compared with those from PtenLoxP/LoxP:PB-Cre4 littermate controls. HGF-induced cell proliferation and migration also increased in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from animals with both Met transgene expression and Pten deletion compared with Pten-null MEFs.

Molecular comparisons between primary tumors and metastases can provide insights into the pathways and processes involved. Here, we systematically analyzed and cataloged molecular correlates of metastasis using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets across 11 different cancer types, these data involving 4,473 primary tumor samples and 395 tumor metastasis samples (including 369 from melanoma). For each cancer type, widespread differences in gene transcription between primary and metastasis samples were observed. For several cancer types, metastasis-associated genes from TCGA comparisons were found to overlap extensively with external results from independent profiling datasets of metastatic tumors. Although some differential expression patterns associated with metastasis were found to be shared across multiple cancer types, by and large each cancer type showed a metastasis signature that was distinctive from those of the other cancer types. Functional categories of genes enriched in multiple cancer type-specific metastatic overexpression signatures included cellular response to stress, DNA repair, oxidation-reduction process, protein deubiquitination, and receptor activity. The TCGA-derived prostate cancer metastasis signature in particular could define a subset of aggressive primary prostate cancer. Transglutaminase 2 protein and mRNA were both elevated in metastases from breast and melanoma cancers. Alterations in miRNAs and in DNA methylation were also identified.

Two groups (n = 6) of animals were inoculated with 1 × 106 MatLyLu tumor cells solved in 0.1 ml NaCl either by footpad or hock injection. All animals were examined before tumor inoculation and before euthanasia using a 3.0 Tesla MRI. Histological evaluation of all organs was performed post mortem.  Results:   Both types of injection were able to induce the adenocarcinoma model using MatLyLu tumor cells. The primary tumor could be visualized in MRI and confirmed histologically. Comparing the risk of reflux and the maximum injection volume during injection, the hock injection was superior to the footpad injection (less reflux, less anatomical restrictions for larger volumes). The hock injection induces a faster tumor growth compared to the footpad injection. As consequence the maximum level of long term discomfort after hock injection was reached earlier, even if it grew on a not weight bearing structure. Early lymph node tumor metastasis could not be observed macroscopically nor detected histologically. Therefore the reproducibility of the MatLyLu tumor model is questionable.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the microRNAs-23b/-27b as well as the possible CCNG1 target gene in tissue samples from patients with localized prostate cancer that progressed to castration-resistant prostate cancer and in a castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line (PC-3). The microRNAs and target gene expression levels of the surgical specimens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, was transfected with pre-miR-23b, pre-miR-27b, and their respective controls using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and exposed or not to flutamide. After transfections, expression levels of both the microRNAs and the gene, CCNG1, were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The apoptosis and cell cycle assays were performed on the mini MUSE cytometer. MicroRNAs-23b/-27b were underexpressed in surgical specimens of prostate cancer; however, their target gene, CCNG1, was overexpressed in 69% of the cases. After transfection with the microRNAs-23b/-27b and flutamide, we observed a reduction in gene expression compared with cells that were treated only with microRNAs or only with flutamide. In the apoptosis assay, we demonstrated cell sensitization following transfection with microRNAs-23b/-27b and potentiation when co-administered with flutamide. The number of cells in apoptosis was almost three times higher with the simultaneous treatments (miR + flutamide) compared with the control (p < 0.05). In the cell cycle assay, only flutamide treatment showed better results; a higher number of cells were found in the G0-G1 phase, and a lower percentage of cells completed the final phase of the cycle (p < 0.05). We conclude that microRNAs-23b/-27b are downexpressed in prostate cancer, and their target gene, CCNG1, is overexpressed. We postulated that microRNAs-23b/-27b sensitize the PC-3 cell line and that after the addition of flutamide in the apoptosis assay, we would observe synergism in the treatments between miR and flutamide. In the cell cycle assay, the use of flutamide was sufficient to decrease the number of cells in mitosis.

Resveratrol interacts with reactive oxygen species (ROS) as an antioxidant or pro-oxidant. Resveratrol affects the expression and activities of ROS-producing enzymes and organelles. It is therefore important to consider how cell culture conditions might determine the effects of resveratrol on cultured cells. We determined the effects of resveratrol on cell growth, hydrogen peroxide production, and mitochondrial network characteristics in C2C12 mouse myoblasts and PC3 human prostate cancer cells under conditions of physiological (5%) and supra-physiological (18%) oxygen, and normo- (5 mM) and hyper-glycemia (25 mM).

Many of the effects of resveratrol on cell growth, hydrogen peroxide production, and mitochondrial network characteristics that were seen in 25 mM glucose and/or 18% oxygen were absent under the physiologically relevant conditions of 5 mM glucose with 5% oxygen.

However, some case reports indicate that PSMA-targeted imaging could be ineffectual for delineation of neuroendocrine (NE) prostate cancer (NEPC) lesions due to the suppression of the PSMA gene (FOLH1). These same reports suggest that targeting somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) could be an alternative diagnostic target for NEPC patients. This study evaluates the correlation between expression of FOLH1, NEPC marker genes and SSTR2. We evaluated the transcript abundance for FOLH1 and SSTR2 genes as well as NE markers across 909 tumors. A significant suppression of FOLH1 in NEPC patient samples and AdPC samples with high expression of NE marker genes was observed. We also investigated protein alterations of PSMA and SSTR2 in an NE-induced cell line derived by hormone depletion and lineage plasticity by loss of p53. PSMA is suppressed following NE induction and cellular plasticity in p53-deficient NEPC model. The PSMA-suppressed cells have more colony formation ability and resistance to enzalutamide treatment. Conversely, SSTR2 was only elevated following hormone depletion. In 18 NEPC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models we find a significant suppression of FOLH1 and amplification of SSTR2 expression. Due to the observed FOLH1-supressed signature of NEPC, this study cautions on the reliability of using PMSA as a target for molecular imaging of NEPC.

Here, we revealed for the first time that GV1001 is a novel ligand for gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR). The docking prediction for GV1001 against GnRHR showed high binding affinity. Binding of GV1001 to GnRHR stimulated the Gαs-coupled cAMP signaling pathway and antagonized Gαq-coupled Ca2+ release by leuprolide acetate (LA), a GnRHR agonist. Repeated injection of GV1001 attenuated both serum testosterone level and seminal vesicle weight via desensitization of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. We then tested whether GV1001 has an inhibitory effect on tumor growth of LNCaP cells, androgen receptor-positive human prostate cancer (PCa) cells.

ATM mutation is found with increased prevalence in advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ATM mutation-driving disease progression are still largely unknown. Here, we report that ATM mutation contributes to the CRPC progression through a metabolic rather than DNA repair mechanism. We showed that ATM deficiency generated by CRISPR/Cas9 editing promoted CRPC cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. ATM deficiency altered cellular metabolism and enhanced Warburg effect in CRPC cells. We demonstrated that ATM deficiency shunted the glucose flux to aerobic glycolysis by upregulating LDHA expression, which generated more lactate and produced less mitochondrial ROS to promote CRPC cell growth. Inhibition of LDHA by siRNA or inhibitor FX11 generated less lactate and accumulated more ROS in ATM-deficient CRPC cells and therefore potentiated the cell death of ATM-deficient CRPC cells. These findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy for ATM-mutant CRPC patients by targeting LDHA-mediated glycolysis metabolism, which might be effective for the PARP inhibitor resistant mCRPC tumors.""","""['Lingfan Xu', 'Enze Ma', 'Tao Zeng', 'Ruya Zhao', 'Yulei Tao', 'Xufeng Chen', 'Jeff Groth', 'Chaozhao Liang', 'Hailiang Hu', 'Jiaoti Huang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['N-Myc promotes therapeutic resistance development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer by differentially regulating miR-421/ATM pathway.', 'MET inhibition enhances PARP inhibitor efficacy in castration-resistant prostate cancer by suppressing the ATM/ATR and PI3K/AKT pathways.', 'ATM‑JAK‑PD‑L1 signaling pathway inhibition decreases EMT and metastasis of androgen‑independent prostate cancer.', 'DNA Repair Deficiency Is Common in Advanced Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Targeting DNA Repair: The Role of PARP Inhibition in the Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'The role of glutamine metabolism in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Metabolic changes during prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variants Contribute to the Upregulation of DNA Repair in Prostate Cancer.', 'Metabolic reprogramming as an emerging mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapies in prostate cancer.']"""

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are known to provide protumorigenic influences that contribute to treatment failure. In this study, we examined the contribution of TAMs to docetaxel treatment. An increased infiltration of macrophages in CRPC tumors was observed after treatment with docetaxel. Prostate cancer cells treated with docetaxel released more macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF-1 or CSF-1), IL-10 and other factors, which can recruit and modulate circulating monocytes to promote their protumorigenic functions. Inhibition of CSF-1 receptor kinase signaling with a small molecule antagonist (PLX3397) in CRPC models significantly reduces the infiltration of TAMs and their influences. As such, the addition of PLX3397 to docetaxel treatment resulted in a more durable tumor growth suppression than docetaxel alone.

Herein, we report that, the expression of Krüppel-like factor 14 (KLF14), a master transcription factor in the regulation of lipid metabolism, was significantly induced in castration-insensitive PCa cells and tumor tissues from a mouse xenograft model of CRPC. KLF14 upregulation in PCa cells, which was stimulated upstream by oxidative stress, was dependent on multiple pathways including PI3K/AKT, p42/p44 MAPK, AMPK and PKC pathways. By means of ectopic overexpression and genetic inactivation, we further show that KLF14 promoted cell growth via positive regulation of the antioxidant response under androgen-depleted conditions. Mechanistically, KLF14 coupled to p300 and CBP to enhance the transcriptional activation of HMOX1, the gene encoding the antioxidative enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) that is one of the most important mechanisms of cell adaptation to stress. Transient knockdown of HMOX1 is sufficient to overcome KLF14 overexpression-potentiated PCa cell growth under androgen-depleted conditions. From a pharmacological standpoint, in vivo administration of ZnPPIX (a specific inhibitor of HO-1) effectively attenuates castration-resistant progression in the mouse xenograft model, without changing KLF14 level. Together, these results provide comprehensive insight into the KLF14-dependent regulation of antioxidant response and subsequent pathogenesis of castration resistance and indicate that interventions targeting the KLF14/HO-1 adaptive mechanism should be further explored for CRPC treatment.""","""['Xiao-Hui Luo', 'Jian-Zhou Liu', 'Bo Wang', 'Qun-Li Men', 'Yu-Quan Ju', 'Feng-Yan Yin', 'Chao Zheng', 'Wei Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Role of protein S in castration-resistant prostate cancer-like cells.', 'KLF9, a transcription factor induced in flutamide-caused cell apoptosis, inhibits AKT activation and suppresses tumor growth of prostate cancer cells.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Krüppel-like factors in tumors: Key regulators and therapeutic avenues.', 'Oxidative stress and redox signaling in CRPC progression: therapeutic potential of clinically-tested Nrf2-activators.', 'Determining KLF14 tertiary structure and diagnostic significance in brain cancer progression.', 'KLF14 targets ITGB1 to inhibit the progression of cervical cancer via the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.', 'PGC1 alpha coactivates ERG fusion to drive antioxidant target genes under metabolic stress.']"""

However, there is a need for further clinical evidence supporting a correlation between OSAS and cancer incidence.  Objectives:   To reveal whether OSAS presence and severity is correlated with cancer incidence in a large homogenous patients' cohort.  Methods:   We analyzed a cohort of over 5,000 concurrently enrolled patients, age > 18, with suspected OSAS, from a tertiary medical academic center. Patients underwent whole night polysomnography, the gold standard diagnostic tool for OSAS, and were classified for severity according to the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI). Data on cancer incidence were obtained from the Israel National Cancer Registry. A multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis, adjusted for age, gender, and BMI, was performed to estimate the hazard-ratio of new cancer incidence.  Results:   Among 5,243 subjects with a median follow-up of 5.9 years, 265 were diagnosed with cancer. The most prevalent cancers were prostate (14.7%), hematological (12.8%), urothelial (9.4%), colorectal (9%), and breast (8.3%).

We studied TR in men who received RT and either short-term ADT (STADT) or long-term ADT (LTADT) and aimed to create a nomogram to predict TR.  Methods and materials:   We identified consecutive localized prostate cancer patients treated with ADT-RT at 2 academic medical centers from January 2011 to October 2016 with documented baseline testosterone. TR was time from last ADT injection to testosterone normalization. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time to TR. Cox proportional hazards models identified TR predictors. A nomogram was trained with site 1 and externally validated with site 2.  Results:   A total of 340 patients were included; 69.7% received STADT for a median duration of 6 months; 30.3% received LTADT for a median duration of 24.3 months. Median follow-up was 26.7 months. Median time for TR was 17.2 months for STADT and 24.0 months for LTADT patients (P = .004). The 2-year cumulative incidence of TR was 53.1% after LTADT versus 65.7% after STADT (P = .004). On multivariate analysis, shorter duration ADT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; P = .004), higher pretreatment testosterone (HR, 1.004; P < .001), and lower body mass index (HR, 0.95; P = .002) were associated with shorter time to TR. Older age (HR, 0.97; P = .09) and white race (HR, 0.67; P = .06) trended as longer TR predictors. A nomogram was generated to predict probability of TR at 1, 2, and 3 years. The concordance index was 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.78) for the validation cohort.  Conclusions:   In this population of localized prostate cancer patients, TR after ADT-RT was variable.

Results:   Our obtained data indicated that exposure of DU-145 and MCF-7 cells to Docetaxel and Mitoxantrone enhances the expression of neural type DDC mRNA isoforms. Interestingly, DDC protein levels were not affected, despite the cytotoxic events elicited by the chemotherapeutic agent treatment. Moreover, expression of DDC and its alternative protein isoforms, appear to enhance the cytotoxic and apoptotic events conferred by exposure to Docetaxel and Mitoxantrone.

Patients and methods:   A consecutive sample of men undergoing TRUS/MRI-fusion-guided biopsy with the UroNav® system (Invivo International, Best, The Netherlands) who also underwent concurrent systematic biopsy was included. By comparing the grade of cancer diagnosed on targeted and systematic biopsy cores, we identified cases where clinically significant disease (Gleason score ≥3+4) was only found on systematic and not targeted cores. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictive factors for finding significant cancer on systematic cores only. We then used these data to develop a nomogram and evaluated its utility using decision curve analysis.  Results:   Of the 398 men undergoing TRUS/MRI-fusion-guided biopsy in our study, there were 46 (11.6%) cases in which clinically significant cancer was missed on targeted biopsy and detected on systematic biopsy. The clinical setting, number of MRI lesions identified, and the highest Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score of the lesions, were all found to be predictors of this. Our model had a good discriminative ability (concordance index = 0.70). The results from our decision curve analysis show that this model provides a higher net clinical benefit than either biopsying all men or omitting biopsy in all patients when the threshold probability is <30%.  Conclusion:   We found that omitting concurrent systematic biopsy in men undergoing TRUS/MRI-fusion-guided biopsy would miss significant disease in more than one in 10 patients. We propose a prediction model with good discriminative ability that can be used to improve patient selection for performing concurrent systematic biopsy in order to minimise the number of missed significant cancers. It is important that our model is validated in external cohorts before being employed in routine clinical practice.""","""['Niranjan J Sathianathen', 'Christopher A Warlick', 'Christopher J Weight', 'Maria A Ordonez', 'Benjamin Spilseth', 'Gregory J Metzger', 'Paari Murugan', 'Badrinath R Konety']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Can systematic biopsy be safely avoided at the time of magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasonography fusion biopsy?', 'Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Multicentre evaluation of targeted and systematic biopsies using magnetic resonance and ultrasound image-fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy.', 'Risk-stratification based on magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density may reduce unnecessary follow-up biopsy procedures in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Individualized Decision Making in Transperineal Prostate Biopsy: Should All Men Undergo an Additional Systematic Biopsy?', 'Combining targeted and systematic prostate biopsy improves prostate cancer detection and correlation with the whole mount histopathology in biopsy naïve and previous negative biopsy patients.', 'Predicting the Performance of Concurrent Systematic Random Biopsies during Image Fusion Targeted Sampling of Multi-Parametric MRI Detected Prostate Cancer.

Now, t-NEPC poses a major clinical problem as approximately 20% of CRPC cases bear this subtype-a rate of occurrence that is predicted to rise with the widespread use of ARPI therapies. Unfortunately, there are no targeted therapies currently available to treat t-NEPC as the origin and molecular underpinnings of t-NEPC development remain unclear. In the present study, we identify that RNA splicing of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1) gene is a unique event in t-NEPC patients. Specifically, upregulation of the GIT1-A splice variant and downregulation of the GIT1-C variant expressions are associated with t-NEPC patient tumors, patient-derived xenografts, and cell models. RNA-binding assays show that RNA splicing of GIT1 is directly driven by SRRM4 and is associated with the neuroendocrine phenotype in CRPC cohorts. We show that GIT1-A and GIT1-C regulate differential transcriptomes in prostate cancer cells, where GIT1-A regulates genes associated with morphogenesis, neural function, environmental sensing via cell-adhesion processes, and epigenetic regulation. Consistent with our transcriptomic analyses, we report opposing functions of GIT1-A and GIT1-C in the stability of focal adhesions, whereby GIT1-A promotes focal adhesion stability. In summary, our study is the first to report that alternative RNA splicing of the GIT1 gene is associated with t-NEPC and reprograms its function involving FA-mediated signaling and cell processes, which may contribute to t-NEPC development.""","""['Ahn R Lee', 'Yu Gan', 'Ning Xie', 'Varune R Ramnarine', 'Jessica M Lovnicki', 'Xuesen Dong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Roles of Alternative RNA Splicing of the Bif-1 Gene by SRRM4 During the Development of Treatment-induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'A novel mechanism of SRRM4 in promoting neuroendocrine prostate cancer development via a pluripotency gene network.', 'RNA Splicing of the BHC80 Gene Contributes to Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'RNA splicing and splicing regulator changes in prostate cancer pathology.', 'Clinical and Biological Features of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Anti-Androgen Receptor Therapies in Prostate Cancer: A Brief Update and Perspective.', 'Aggressive variants of prostate cancer: underlying mechanisms of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation.', 'Prostate cancer: Alternatively spliced mRNA transcripts in tumor progression and their uses as therapeutic targets.', 'Systematic Analysis of Survival-Associated Alternative Splicing Signatures in Thyroid Carcinoma.', 'Many Voices in a Choir: Tumor-Induced Neurogenesis and Neuronal Driven Alternative Splicing Sound Like Suspects in Tumor Growth and Dissemination.']"""

In this study, the effects of C. sativum extract on gene expression, viability, colony formation, migration, and invasion of PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines have been investigated. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) dose in PC-3 and LNCaP cells was detected to be 2 and 5 mg/mL at the 24th hour, respectively. C. sativum extracts have been observed to cause a significant decrease in the expression of Akt and Bcl-2 in the PC-3 cells and just Akt in LNCaP cells while increasing in the expression of p53, caspase-9, caspase-10, PTEN, DR5, TRADD, PUMA, and NOXA. DR4 expression was increased in LNCaP cell line but not PC-3, and APAF and BID had increased expression in PC-3 but not the LNCaP cells. Our observations have shown that C. sativum extract decreased colony formation while inhibiting cell invasion and migration. Cell migration was hindered in PC-3 but not the LNCaP cells.

Three main performance metrics were evaluated: capture efficiency, capture reproducibility, and clinical efficacy. Use of the plasmonic chip to capture SK-BR-3 cells in PBS, resulted in a capture efficiency of 82%, compared to 76% with a regular chip. Both chips showed excellent capture reproducibility for all three cells lines evaluated (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, Colo 205) in both PBS and peripheral blood, with R2 values ranging from 0.983 to 0.996. Finally, performance of the plasmonic chip was evaluated on thirteen peripheral blood samples in patients with both breast and prostate cancer. The regular chip detected 2-8 cells per 5 mL of blood, while the plasmonic chip detected 8-85 cells per 5 mL of blood in parallel samples. In summary, we successfully demonstrate improved CTC capture and detection capabilities through use of plasmonic-enhanced near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence screening in both in vitro and ex vivo experiments.

Results:   The actuarial 5-year biochemical failure-free survival rates (bNED) were 92.9% and 95.6% (p = 0.25) in the HDR-BT and LDR-BT groups, respectively, and it was 100% and 97.3% (p = 0.99) in the low-risk, 95.6% and 94.3% (p = 0.19) in the intermediate, 89.6% and 94.9% (p = 0.26) in the high-risk groups, and 93.1% and 94.9% (p = 0.98) in selected high-risk group excluding T3b-4 and initial PSA ≥50. IPTW correction also indicated no difference in bNED between LDR-BT and HDR-BT groups. LDR-BT showed a higher incidence of genitourinary (GU) toxicity grade ≥2 than that of HDR-BT in the acute phase and grade 1 toxicity in late phase.

Patients and methods:   A retrospective study was conducted in 2009 biopsy-naive patients with suspected prostate cancer (PSA ≤20 ng/mL). Patients underwent TRUS-Bx (n = 1786) or MRI-guided target prostate biopsy (MRI-TBx; n = 223) from September 2013 to March 2017 and were stratified according to each of 4 PSA cutoffs. MRI-TBx was performed on lesions with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores of 3 to 5 on mpMRI. Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was defined as Gleason ≥7. Propensity score matching was performed using the prebiopsy variables, which included age, PSA, prostate volume, and PSA density.  Results:   Propensity score matching resulted in 222 patients in each group. There were significant differences between the TRUS-Bx and MRI-TBx groups in the overall detection rates of prostate cancer (41.4% vs. 55.4%; P = .003) and csPCa (30.1% vs. 42.8%; P = .005). However, across PSA cutoffs, MRI-TBx detected more prostate cancer than TRUS-Bx at PSA levels of 2.5 to <4 (29.5% vs. 56.6%; P < .001). The csPCa detection rates of TRUS-Bx and MRI-TBx did not differ significantly within the PSA cutoffs. There was a significantly higher detection rate of prostate cancer and csPCa in lesions with PI-RADS scores 4 and 5 than in those with a score of 3.

Aim:   To compare IPP outcomes among those who had undergone prior RT vs a cohort who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) before insertion of IPP.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare Database was queried for men with prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent RT (n = 83,277) or RP (n = 32,608) with subsequent IPP insertion between 2002 and 2013. Men who had undergone both RT and RP were excluded from the analysis.  Main outcome measure:   The primary outcome was reoperation, defined by removal, revision, or replacement of the IPP.  Results:   We identified 350 men who received an IPP following RT and 653 who received an IPP following RP. Men who underwent RT were older (P < .01) and had more comorbidities (P < .01). There were no significant differences in overall reoperation rates at 90 days (P = .78), 1 year (P = .52), or 3 years (P = .48). Time-to-event analysis demonstrated that RT was not associated with an increased likelihood of overall reoperation (hazard ratio [HR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-2.29, P = .09). There was no association between time from RT to IPP and overall reoperation rates.  Clinical implications:   Prior RT for the treatment of PCa does not impact the revision or removal rates of IPPs as compared with a cohort of non-radiated patients who underwent RP.  Strength & limitations:   The strength includes the analysis of outcomes among a contemporary, nationwide cohort with robust follow-up. Using diagnosis and procedure codes, we were thoroughly able to capture reoperations. Limitations include the lack of specific indications for reoperation and inability to control for surgeon experience or technique.

However, as a cytotoxic therapy, there is a need to understand the experiences of men with mHSPC receiving docetaxel and their carers in a real-world setting.  Methods:   During phase 1, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with men with mHSPC (n = 31) and their carers (n = 14) in Europe to elicit in-depth data concerning their experiences with docetaxel. Eighteen men were also asked to record their experiences in a diary for 7 days. During phase 2, men with mHSPC (n = 161) and carers of men with mHSPC (n = 135) completed an online survey comprising self-report questionnaires including the Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire, Brief Fatigue Inventory, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate, EuroQol-5-Dimensions and the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (carers only).  Results:   At the outset of therapy, men reported a willingness to take docetaxel to prolong their life, despite being fearful of the potential side effects and impacts on their daily lives. Patient and carer experiences were generally consistent with pre-treatment expectations. However, variations in individual experiences and their ability to tolerate side effects were evident. Fatigue emerged as a prominent symptom with the majority (n = 98, 60.9%) of men reporting experiencing moderate-severe fatigue in the past 24 h. Participant ratings of fatigue were strongly correlated with health-related quality of life (r = - 0.82). Nausea, diarrhoea and sore mouth were also among the most bothersome symptoms for participants.  Conclusions:   Findings from this study highlight that real-world experience of docetaxel may differ from that observed in clinical trials and that care must be taken to ensure that treatment options are tailored to the needs of individual patients to promote not only how long patients survive but also the quality of that survival.

Methods:   The expression of PFKFB4 was first analyzed using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, and confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray and breast cancer tissues from patient samples. Gain- and loss-of- function approaches were used to investigate the effects of PFKFB4 on breast cancer cell migration in vitro. Orthotopic xenograft model and experimental metastasis model were used to assess the effects of PFKFB4 on breast cancer cell metastasis in vivo. ELISA and immunofluorescence staining were used to examine HA production. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting were used to explore the mRNA and protein levels of HAS2, respectively.  Results:   We found that PFKFB4 enhances the migration/invasiveness of breast cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo. Notably, the effects of PFKFB4 on migration are mediated by induction of HAS2 expression and HA production. Moreover, PFKFB4-induced HAS2 up-regulation depends upon the activation of p38 signaling.  Conclusion:   PFKFB4 promotes the metastasis of breast cancer cells via induction of HAS2 expression and HA production in a p38-dependent manner. Therefore, the PFKFB4/p38/HAS2 signaling pathway may serve as a potential therapeutic target for metastatic breast cancer.""","""['Ruifang Gao', 'Yanhua Liu', 'Dan Li', 'Jing Xun', 'Wei Zhou', 'Peng Wang', 'Chen Liu', 'Xiru Li', 'Wenzhi Shen', 'Weijun Su', 'Huan Qiao', 'Dwayne G Stupack', 'Na Luo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['CD44ICD promotes breast cancer stemness via PFKFB4-mediated glucose metabolism.', 'Metabolic enzyme PFKFB4 activates transcriptional coactivator SRC-3 to drive breast cancer.', 'Hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) regulates cell phenotype and invadopodia formation in luminal-like breast cancer cells.', 'HAS2 and CD44 in breast tumorigenesis.', 'Regulation of hyaluronan biosynthesis and clinical impact of excessive hyaluronan production.', 'Reprogramming of glucose metabolism via PFKFB4 is critical in FGF16-driven invasion of breast cancer cells.', 'Regulation of Autophagy via Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism in Cancer.', 'Role of Hyaluronic Acid in Selected Malignant Neoplasms in Women.', 'Hypoxic activation of PFKFB4 in breast tumor microenvironment shapes metabolic and cellular plasticity to accentuate metastatic competence.', 'β-elemene Isopropanolamine Derivative LXX-8250 Induces Apoptosis Through Impairing Autophagic Flux via PFKFB4 Repression in Melanoma Cells.']"""

We describe clinical and pathological findings in a large cohort of patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma who were treated with radical prostatectomy and in whom extraprostatic extension was identified on prostate needle biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Using our institutional pathology database we identified 83 patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma and with extraprostatic extension on prostate needle biopsy between 2000 to 2018 who underwent radical prostatectomy and had clinical followup information. Clinical and pathological outcomes were examined.  Results:   Of the 83 patients 54 (65%) presented with clinical stage T2 or greater disease. On biopsy 50 of the 83 patients (60%) had Grade Group 4-5 and 66 (81%) had perineural invasion. Extraprostatic extension was confirmed in the radical prostatectomy specimen in 81 of 83 cases (98%). At radical prostatectomy 49 of 83 patients (59%) had positive surgical margins, 37 (45%) had seminal vesicle invasion and 30 (37%) had lymph node involvement. Median followup after radical prostatectomy was 2 years. Overall 34 of 76 men (45%) received postoperative radiation a median of 1 year after radical prostatectomy and 8 (11%) received chemotherapy a median of 2 years after radical prostatectomy. The 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 48.4% (95% CI 0.345-0.610) and the 3-year metastasis-free survival rate was 75.2% (95% CI 0.603-0.851).  Conclusions:   Patients in whom extraprostatic extension is detected on prostate needle biopsy almost always have extraprostatic disease and markedly adverse pathology findings at radical prostatectomy. Many of them experience biochemical recurrence and most will require multimodal therapy. These data can be useful to counsel such patients in regard to the treatment approach and the expected outcomes after surgery.""","""['Farzana A Faisal', 'Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'Misop Han', 'Katarzyna J Macura', 'Christian P Pavlovich#', 'Tamara L Lotan#']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Correlation of the anatomo-pathological staging of radical prostatectomy specimens with the amount of cancer in the preoperative sextant biopsy.', 'Prediction of extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer based on needle biopsy findings: perineural invasion lacks significance on multivariate analysis.', 'Perineural invasion on prostate biopsy does not predict adverse pathological outcome.', 'Prognostic significance of tumor volume in radical prostatectomy and needle biopsy specimens.', 'Prostate cancer reporting and staging: needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Assessment of MYC/PTEN Status by Gene-Protein Assay in Grade Group 2 Prostate Biopsies.', 'Reports of prostate needle biopsies-what pathologists provide and urologists want.', 'Soluble CD105 is prognostic of disease recurrence in prostate cancer patients.']"""

Materials and methods:   Using the National Cancer Database we identified 536,539 men 40 years old or older who presented with localized intermediate and high risk prostate cancer in the United States between 2004 and 2015. Institutions were ranked according to the proportion of black and Hispanic patients treated at a given institution, and the top decile institutions were defined as minority serving hospitals. We used multivariable analyses to characterize the association between minority serving hospitals and 3 end points, including receipt of definitive treatment, time to definitive treatment and receipt of androgen deprivation therapy in young (65 years or younger) and healthy (no comorbidity) men treated with external beam radiation therapy.  Results:   A total of 162 and 1,168 hospitals were defined as minority and nonminority serving hospitals, respectively. On multivariable analyses treatment at minority serving hospitals was associated with decreased odds of receiving definitive treatment (adjusted OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.85, p <0.001). Adjusted mean ± SE time to treatment was significantly longer at minority serving hospitals compared to nonminority serving hospitals (4.9 ± 2.2 days, p = 0.024). Among young and healthy men there was no association between treatment at a minority serving hospital and receipt of androgen deprivation therapy in conjunction with external beam radiation (AOR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75-1.09, p = 0.291).  Conclusions:   Treatment at a minority serving hospital was associated with lower odds of receiving definitive therapy and longer time to definitive therapy for localized intermediate and high risk prostate cancer despite adjustment for race.

In addition, ACSL4 has been associated to certain types of hormone resistance in prostate cancer. Chemotherapeutic treatment of disseminated breast cancer is usually faced with therapy resistance associated to ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter expression, which detect and eject anti-cancer drugs from cells. In this context, the aim of the present work was to study the role of ACSL4 in anti-cancer drug resistance and the involvement of ABC transporters in the underlying mechanisms. To this end, we used MCF-7 Tet-Off/ACSL4 and MDA-MB-231 mock cells, which overexpress ACSL4, and control line MCF-7 Tet-Off empty vector, MDA-MB-231 shRNA ACSL4 and MDA-MB-231 wild type cells. Assays were conducted on cell viability (MTT), cell proliferation (BrdU), drug efflux (flow cytometry), ACSL4-responsive drug resistance ABC transporter genes (RNA-Seq), transporter mRNA expression, protein levels and signaling pathway participation (real-time PCR and Western blot). Higher survival rates upon chemotherapeutic treatment were obtained in MCF-7 Tet-Off/ACSL4 and MDA-MB-231 mock cells, an effect counteracted by doxycycline- or shRNA-induced ACSL4 inhibition, respectively. A synergic effect of ACSL4 inhibitor triacsin C and chemotherapeutic drugs was observed on the inhibition of MDA-MB-231 wild type cell proliferation. MCF-7 Tet-Off/ACSL4 cells showed greater doxorubicin, Hoechst 33342 and calcein AM efflux. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 shRNA ACSL4 cells evidenced inhibition of chemotherapeutic drug efflux. ABCG2, ABCC4, and ABCC8 were identified as ACSL4-responsive drug resistance genes whose expression was increased in MCF-7 Tet-Off/ACSL4 cells but inhibited in MDA-MB-231 shRNA ACSL4 cells. Further cell survival assays in the presence of Ko 143 and Ceefourin 1, inhibitors of ABCG2 and ABCC4, respectively, upon chemotherapeutic treatment showed greater participation of ABCG2 in anti-cancer drug resistance in cells overexpressing ACSL4. In addition, ACSL4 inhibition and chemotherapeutic treatment combined with rapamycin-induced mTOR inhibition synergically inhibited proliferation and reduced ABCG2 expression in cells overexpressing ACSL4. In sum, ACSL4 may be regarded as a novel therapeutic target regulating the expression of transporters involved in anticancer drug resistance through the mTOR pathway to restore drug sensitivity in tumors with poor prognosis for disease-free and overall survival.""","""['Ulises Daniel Orlando', 'Ana Fernanda Castillo', 'Mayra Agustina Ríos Medrano', 'Angela Rosaria Solano', 'Paula Mariana Maloberti', 'Ernesto Jorge Podesta']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Acyl-CoA synthetase-4, a new regulator of mTOR and a potential therapeutic target for enhanced estrogen receptor function in receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer.', 'The phytoestrogen genistein enhances multidrug resistance in breast cancer cell lines by translational regulation of ABC transporters.', 'Regulation mechanism of breast cancer resistance protein by toremifene to reverse BCRP-mediated multidrug resistance in breast cancer cells.', 'Multidrug resistance mediated by the breast cancer resistance protein BCRP (ABCG2).', 'Multidrug resistance: retrospect and prospects in anti-cancer drug treatment.', 'ACSL4: biomarker, mediator and target in quadruple negative breast cancer.', 'Finding New Molecular Targets of Two Copper(II)-Hydrazone Complexes on Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells Using Mass-Spectrometry-Based Quantitative Proteomics.', 'Sex differences in the intergenerational link between maternal and neonatal whole blood DNA methylation: a genome-wide analysis in 2 birth cohorts.', 'Mechanism of ferroptosis in a rat model of premature ovarian insufficiency induced by cisplatin.', 'Lipid Metabolism Heterogeneity and Crosstalk with Mitochondria Functions Drive Breast Cancer Progression and Drug Resistance.']"""

Methods:   An expert-devised online questionnaire was completed by the members of the British Uro-oncology Group (BUG).  Results:   Of 160 uro-oncologists invited, 84 completed the questionnaire. Before initiating ADT in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer, only 45% of respondents measured testosterone levels and 61% did not measure testosterone at all during ADT in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. However, in men with metastatic prostate cancer, 71% of the uro-oncologists measured testosterone before starting ADT and the majority continued testing during treatment. Approximately two-thirds of respondents did not prescribe TRT for their patients who were in remission following neo(adjuvant) ADT and who had castration levels of testosterone.  Discussion:   Among UK uro-oncologists, the measurement of testosterone levels before and during ADT was not typically part of routine practice in the management of patients with prostate cancer. However, testosterone levels were checked more frequently for patients with metastatic disease than disease at an earlier stage. Testing could be conducted in parallel with PSA measurement as testosterone levels are linked to biochemical failure. The majority of specialists participating in the survey did not prescribe TRT for their patients in remission following ADT.

Magmas is highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, and is essential for cell viability. Magmas expression levels are increased in prostate cancers and pituitary adenomas. Moreover, silencing Magmas by RNAi sensitizes pituitary adenoma cells to pro-apoptotic stimuli and induces a G0/G1 accumulation. The aim of this study was to examine whether inhibition of Magmas by small molecule inhibitors could be beneficial for the treatment of malignant gliomas.  Methods:   We evaluated the expression of Magmas in patient-derived glioblastoma tissue samples and xenograft models. We studied the feasibility of a small molecule Magmas inhibitor (BT#9) as a therapeutic agent in stable human glioma cell lines and high-grade patient derived glioma stem-like cells.  Results:   Magmas was overexpressed in tissue sections from glioma patients and xenografts. In vivo studies revealed that BT#9 could cross the blood-brain barrier in the animal model. Magmas inhibition by BT#9 in glioma cell lines significantly decreased cell proliferation, induced apoptosis along with vacuole formation, and blocked migration and invasion. In addition, BT#9 treatment decreased the respiratory function of glioma cells, supporting the role that Magmas serves as a reactive oxygen species regulator.  Conclusions:   This is the first study on the role of Magmas in glioma.

Coronal T1, STIR, and reconstructed coronal high b-values DWI were obtained for all patients. Two musculoskeletal radiologists read individual sequences, pairs of sequences (T1-DWI, T1-STIR, and STIR-DWI), and all combined (T1-STIR-DWI) to detect bone involvement.

Results:   Interobserver agreement for individual and combined MRI sequences was very good in the PCa group and ranged from good to very good in the MM group (0.76-1.00). In PCa patients, T1-DWI, T1-STIR, and T1-STIR-DWI showed the highest performance (sensitivity = 100% [95% CI = 90.5-100%], specificity = 100% [75.3-100%]).

This exploratory study investigates bone flare in mCRPC patients receiving androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors using 18F-NaF PET/CT.  Methods:   Twenty-nine mCRPC patients undergoing AR-inhibiting therapy (abiraterone, orteronel, enzalutamide) received NaF PET/CT scans at baseline, week 6, and week 12 of treatment. SUV metrics were extracted globally for each patient (SUV) and for each individual lesion (iSUV). Bone flare was defined as increasing SUV metrics or lesion number at week 6 followed by subsequent week 12 decrease. Differences in metrics across timepoints were compared using Wilcoxon tests. Cox proportional hazard regression was conducted between global metrics and progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   Total SUV was most sensitive for flare detection and was identified in 14/23 (61%) patients receiving CYP17A1-inhibitors (abiraterone, orteronel), and not identified in any of six patients receiving enzalutamide. The appearance of new lesions did not account for initial increases in SUV metrics. iSUV metrics followed patient-level trends: bone flare positive patients showed a median of 72% (range: 0-100%) of lesions with total iSUV flare. Increasing mean SUV at week 6 correlated with extended PFS (HR = 0.58, p = 0.02).  Conclusion:   NaF PET bone flare was present on 61% of mCRPC patients in the first 6 weeks of treatment with CYP17A1-inhibitors. Characterization provided in this study suggests favorable PFS in patients showing bone flare. This characterization of NaF flare is important for guiding treatment assessment schedules to better distinguish between patients showing bone flare and those truly progressing, and should be performed for all emerging mCRPC treatments and imaging agents.""","""['Amy J Weisman', 'Stephanie A Harmon', 'Timothy G Perk', 'Jens Eickhoff', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Karen A Kurdziel', 'William L Dahut', 'John L Humm', 'Andrea B Apolo', 'Steven M Larson', 'Michael J Morris', 'Scott B Perlman', 'Glenn Liu', 'Robert Jeraj']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Quantitative Assessment of Early 18FSodium Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Response to Treatment in Men With Metastatic Prostate Cancer to Bone.', 'Exploring Spatial-Temporal Changes in 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT and Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated With Enzalutamide.', 'Impact of Anatomic Location of Bone Metastases on Prognosis in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', '18F-NaF-PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy in the Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer.', 'Feasibility of Global Assessment of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer with 18F-Sodium Fluoride-PET/Computed Tomography.', 'Pseudoprogression after advanced first-line endocrine therapy in metastatic breast cancer with bone metastasis: A case report.', 'Determination and clinical significance of bone pseudoprogression in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.', 'Flare phenomenon in prostate cancer: recent evidence on new drugs and next generation imaging.']"""

However, their widespread adoption and use, where available, are limited by cost and added time. These limitations could be minimized if a biparametric MRI (BP-MRI) focusing on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging is performed. Herein we report the cancer detection rate of BP-MRI compared with full MP-MRI.  Methods:   Biopsy-naive and prior negative biopsy patients with clinical suspicion for PCa underwent MP-MRI with an imaging protocol incorporating narrow field-of-view T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and DCE pelvic MRI. Then patients underwent MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy of target lesions between November 2013 and October 2017. The pathology results were compared to the positivity of the DCE sequence compared to the BP-MRI findings alone.  Results:   There were 648 targeted lesions biopsied in 344 patients. We defined biparametric screen filter positivity as both T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging positivity for the same lesion. The majority of target lesions (552/648, 85%) were screen filter positive. For those that were screen filter negative, a minority (14/96, 15%) had DCE-positive findings. Of these, 2/3 (67%) cancer-positive cases were seen on T2-weighted imaging. For those 82 that were screen filter negative and DCE negative, the DCE phase would not have added imaging suspicion. Only 3/82 (3.7%) were cancer positive; 2 with low risk, grade group 1 cancer and 1 with intraductal carcinoma, all identified on targeted T2-weighted MRI positivity.  Conclusions:   BP-MRI for the evaluation of PCa and for guiding MRI/US fusion-targeted biopsy has the advantages of reducing cost, time, and contrast exposure of MP-MRI by eliminating the DCE phase. These benefits are realized without forfeiting valuable diagnostic information, as shown by similar cancer detection rates of BP-MRI and MP-MRI in this study, particularly for clinically significant cases of PCa.""","""['Rachael L Sherrer', 'Zachary A Glaser', 'Jennifer B Gordetsky', 'Jeffrey W Nix', 'Kristin K Porter', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Added value of diffusion-weighted images and dynamic contrast enhancement in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in the PICTURE trial.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of clinically significant prostate cancer using biparametric magnetic resonance imaging: An evolving concept.', 'Comparison of biparametric and multiparametric MRI in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'The potential role of the microbiota in prostate cancer pathogenesis and treatment.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Parametric maps of spatial two-tissue compartment model for prostate dynamic contrast enhanced MRI - comparison with the standard tofts model in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Radiomics vs radiologist in prostate cancer.

Muscle regulatory factors are basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that heterodimerize with E proteins to bind the regulatory regions of target genes. Their activity can be inhibited by members of the Inhibitor of DNA binding and differentiation (ID) family, which bind E-proteins with high affinity, thereby preventing muscle regulatory factor-dependent transcriptional responses. CCAAT/Enhancer Binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) is a transcription factor expressed in myogenic precursor cells that acts to inhibit myogenic differentiation, though the mechanism remains poorly understood. We identify Id3 as a novel C/EBPβ target gene that inhibits myogenic differentiation. Overexpression of C/EBPβ stimulates Id3 mRNA and protein expression, and is required for C/EBPβ-mediated inhibition of myogenic differentiation. Misexpression of C/EBPβ in myogenic precursors, such as in models of cancer cachexia, prevents the differentiation of myogenic precursors and we show that loss of Id3 rescues differentiation under these conditions, suggesting that the stimulation of Id3 expression by C/EBPβ is an important mechanism by which C/EBPβ inhibits myogenic differentiation.""","""['Hamood AlSudais', 'Neena Lala-Tabbert', 'Nadine Wiper-Bergeron']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Mdm2 promotes myogenesis through the ubiquitination and degradation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β.', 'Expression of CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Beta in Muscle Satellite Cells Inhibits Myogenesis in Cancer Cachexia.', 'CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta is expressed in satellite cells and controls myogenesis.', 'Interactions of proliferation and differentiation signaling pathways in myogenesis.', 'Function of the myogenic regulatory factors Myf5, MyoD, Myogenin and MRF4 in skeletal muscle, satellite cells and regenerative myogenesis.', 'Neutrophil and natural killer cell imbalances prevent muscle stem cell-mediated regeneration following murine volumetric muscle loss.', 'XBP1u Is Involved in C2C12 Myoblast Differentiation via Accelerated Proteasomal Degradation of Id3.', 'C/EBPβ promotes the expression of atrophy-inducing factors by tumours and is a central regulator of cancer cachexia.', ""Current Thoughts of Notch's Role in Myoblast Regulation and Muscle-Associated Disease."", 'Magnesium Deficiency Alters Expression of Genes Critical for Muscle Magnesium Homeostasis and Physiology in Mice.']"""

This study aimed to explore the attitudes, motivations, and concerns of both oncology patients and health care professionals (HCPs) regarding biobanking.  Materials and methods:   Qualitative interviews were conducted with oncology patients and HCPs purposively selected from five Australian hospitals. Patients were invited to give biobanking consent as part of a clinical trial and/or for future research were eligible. HCPs were eligible if involved in consenting patients to biobanking or to donate specimens to clinical trials.  Results:   Twenty-two patients participated, with head and neck (36%) and prostate (18%) the most common cancer diagnoses; all had consented to biobanking. Twenty-two HCPs participated, from across eight cancer streams and five disciplines. Themes identified were (a) biobanking is a ""no brainer""; (b) altruism or scientific enquiry; (c) trust in clinicians, science, and institutions; (d) no consent-just do it; (e) respecting patient choice (""opt-out""); (f) respectful timing of the request; (g) need for emotional/family support; (h) context of the biobanking request matters; and (i) factors for biobanking success.  Discussion:   These findings reinforced previous findings regarding high public trust in, and support for, biobanking. An initial opt-in consent approach with the option of later opt-out was favored by patients to respect and recognize donor generosity, whereas HCPs preferred an upfront opt-out model. Factors impacting biobanking success included the context of the request for use in a trial or specific research question, pre-existing patient and HCP rapport, a local institution champion, and infrastructure.  Implications for practice:   Patients and health care professionals (HCPs) who experienced cancer biobanking consent were overwhelmingly supportive of biobanking. The motivations and approaches to seeking consent were largely mirrored between the groups. The findings of this study support the opt-in model of biobanking favored by patients; however, HCPs preferred an opt-out model. Both groups recognize the importance of making the request for biobanking at an appropriate time, preferably with emotional or family support, and respecting the timing of the request and privacy of the patient. Biobanking success can be promoted by hospital departments with a research focus by identifying an institutional biobanking champion and ensuring local infrastructure is available.""","""['Sonia Yip', 'Jennifer Fleming', 'Heather L Shepherd', 'Adam Walczak', 'Jonathan Clark', 'Phyllis Butow']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""[""Patients' experiences and preferences for opt-in models and health professional involvement in biobanking consent: A cross-sectional survey of Australian cancer outpatients."", 'Enlisting the willing: A study of healthcare professional-initiated and opt-in biobanking consent reveals improvement opportunities throughout the registration process.', ""Australian health care providers' views on opt-out HIV testing."", 'Public Attitudes toward Biobanking of Human Biological Material for Research Purposes: A Literature Review.', ""Health professionals' opinions on supporting a cancer biobank: identification of barriers to combat biobanking pitfalls."", 'The use of personal health information outside the circle of care: consent preferences of patients from an academic health care institution.']"""

However, side effects such as xerostomia are severe and irreversible. To fully harness the potential of targeted α-therapy, it is necessary to increase the therapeutic index of the targeted radioligands. One emerging strategy is to increase clearance half-life through enhanced binding to serum albumin. We have evaluated the albumin-binding PSMA-targeting ligand RPS-074 in a LNCaP xenograft model to determine its potential value to the treatment of prostate cancer. Methods:225Ac-RPS-074 was evaluated in male BALB/c mice bearing LNCaP xenograft tumors. A biodistribution study was performed over 21 d to determine the dosimetry in tumors and normal tissue. The dose response was measured in groups of 7 mice using 37, 74, and 148 kBq of 225Ac-RPS-074 and compared with positive and negative control groups. Mice were sacrificed when tumor volume exceeded 1,500 mm3Results:225Ac-RPS-074 was labeled in greater than 98% radiochemical yield and showed high (>10% injected dose/g) and sustained accumulation in LNCaP tumors from 24 h to beyond 14 d. Signal in blood and highly vascularized tissues was evident over the first 24 h after injection and cleared by 7 d. The tumor-to-kidney ratio was 4.3 ± 0.7 at 24 h and 62.2 ± 9.5 at 14 d. A single injection of 148 kBq induced a complete response in 6 of 7 tumors, with no apparent toxic effects. Treatment with 74 kBq induced a partial response in 7 of 7 tumors, but from 42 d, 6 of 7 experienced significant regrowth. The 37-kBq group experienced a survival benefit relative to the negative control but not compared with the positive control group. Conclusion: A single dose of 148 kBq of 225Ac-RPS-074 induced a complete response in 86% of tumors, with tumor-to-normal-tissue ratios that predict an improved therapeutic index. The use of the macropa chelator enabled quantitative radiolabeling and may facilitate the clinical translation of this promising targeted α-therapeutic.""","""['James M Kelly', 'Alejandro Amor-Coarasa', 'Shashikanth Ponnala', 'Anastasia Nikolopoulou', 'Clarence Williams Jr', 'Nikki A Thiele', 'David Schlyer', 'Justin J Wilson', 'Stephen G DiMagno', 'John W Babich']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Implications for Expanding the Therapeutic Window.', 'Dual-Target Binding Ligands with Modulated Pharmacokinetics for Endoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Trifunctional PSMA-targeting constructs for prostate cancer with unprecedented localization to LNCaP tumors.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a High-Affinity Sarcophagine-Containing PSMA Ligand for 64Cu/67Cu-Based Theranostics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Modulating the pharmacokinetic profile of Actinium-225-labeled macropa-derived radioconjugates by dual targeting of PSMA and albumin.', 'Development of radiopharmaceuticals for targeted alpha therapy: Where do we stand?', '225AcAc-SibuDAB for Targeted Alpha Therapy of Prostate Cancer: Preclinical Evaluation and Comparison with 225AcAc-PSMA-617.', '225Ac-MACROPATATE: A Novel α-Particle Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy for Neuroendocrine Tumors.', 'H2BZmacropa-NCS: A Bifunctional Chelator for Actinium-225 Targeted Alpha Therapy.', 'Advances in PSMA theranostics.']"""

Methods:   Articles investigating the association between three KLK3 (rs1058205, rs2735839, and rs266882) variants and PCa susceptibility were searched from online databases, which included 35,838 patients and 36,369 control participants. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to demonstrate the strength of the association. We also utilized ELISA to detect serum expression of KLK3. In addition, in silico tools were adopted to evaluate the relationship of KLK3 expression and PCa survival time.  Results:   The overall results indicated that polymorphism T>C of rs1058205 was associated with decreased risk of PCa (allele contrast: OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.64-0.88, Pheterogeneity < 0.001; homozygote comparison: OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.42-0.81, Pheterogeneity < 0.001), particularly in Caucasian population (allele contrast: OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.65-0.91, Pheterogeneity < 0.001; homozygote comparison: OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.41-0.82, Pheterogeneity < 0.001). No association was observed between the polymorphism A>G of rs2735839 and risk of PCa. In addition, no association was observed between polymorphism A>G of rs266882 and risk of PCa. Serum KLK3 levels in PCa patients carrying CC/CT genotypes were statistically lower than those carrying TT genotypes.

Methods:   This retrospective study includes 1,807 patients who received a prostatectomy as a primary treatment at two large tertiary referral centers from 1987 to 2015. Multivariate cox model with restricted cubic spline was used to identify optimal time to receive treatment and estimate the risk of biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Median follow-up time of the study was 46 (interquartile range, 18-86) months. Time to treatment was subcategorized based on multivariate cubic spline cox model. In multivariate spline model, adjusted for all the pertinent pretreatment variables, inflection point in the risk of biochemical recurrence was observed around 3 months, which further increased after 6 months. Based on spline model, time to treatment was then divided into 0 to 3 months (61.5%), >3 to 6 months (31.1%), and 6 months (7.4%). In the adjusted cox model, initial delays up to 6 months did not adversely affect the outcome; however, time to treatment >6 months had significantly higher risk of biochemical recurrence (HR, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-2.60; P < 0.01).  Conclusions:   The initial delays up to 6 months in prostate cancer primary treatment may be sustainable without adversely affecting the outcome.

Design, setting, and participants:   From September 2016 to May 2017, patients selected to undergo RARP for clinically localized PCa at a high-volume center were prospectively randomized into group 1 (POD 3; n=72) versus group 2 (POD 5, n=74).  Intervention:   All patients underwent RARP with anatomical posterior and anterior reconstruction.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was to compare acute urinary retention (AUR) and urinary leakage rate in the two groups. The secondary endpoints were early and mid-term postoperative functional outcomes assessed through questionnaires (ICIQ-MLUTS, IPSS), early continence rate, and postoperative pain/discomfort (visual analog scale score). The economic impact of early catheter removal was also assessed.  Results and limitations:   AUR was reported in two (1.4%) cases, one for each study group (p=0.9). One case of vesicourethral leakage was reported (0.7%) in group 1. Urethral discomfort and pain at discharge was significantly higher in group 2 (p=0.03).

Ten patients implanted with (125)I seeds from November 1 st to 30 th, 2017, solstice 30 were selected in Hebei General Hospital. Firstly, pre-plans were designed with 22.2 MBq, prescribed dose were 100-140 Gy. The dose parameters of 90% volume absorbed dose (D(90)), 150% volume fraction (V(150)) and 100% volume fraction (V(100)) were calculated. Then changed 22.2 MBq to actual activity of group A and B, calculated the dose parameters above again. Then dose parameters of D(90), V(150), V(100) in group C were compared with those in group A and B respectively. Result: The actual activity 1 day before the operation was(22.6±0.7)and(23.9±0.9)MBq in group A and B respectively.

TMAs offer a valuable source of well-characterized biological material. However, because of the small tissue sample size method development was essential to provide the sensitivity and reliability necessary for the analysis. Surface digestion of TMA cores was followed by peptide extraction and shotgun proteomics analysis. About 5 times better sensitivity was achieved by the optimized surface digestion compared to bulk digestion of the same TMA spot and it allowed the identification of over 500 proteins from individual prostate TMA cores. Label-free quantitation showed that biological variability among all samples was about 3 times larger than the technical reproducibility. We have identified 189 proteins which showed statistically significant changes (t-test p-value <.05) in abundance between healthy and cancerous tissue samples. The proteomic profile changed according to cancer grade, but did not show a correlation with cancer stage. Results of this pilot study were further evaluated using bioinformatics tools, identifying various protein pathways affected by prostate cancer progression indicating the usefulness of studying TMA cores to identify quantitative changes in tissue proteomics. SIGNIFICANCE: Detailed proteomics analysis of TMAs presents a good alternative for tissue analysis. Here we present a novel method, based on tissue surface digestion and nano-LC-MS measurements, which is capable of identifying and quantifying over 500 proteins from a 1.5 mm diameter tissue section. We compared healthy and cancerous prostate tissue samples, and tissues with various grades and stages of cancer. Tissue proteomics clearly distinguished healthy and cancerous samples, furthermore the results correlated well with cancer grade, but not with cancer stage. Over 100 proteins showed statistically significant abundance changes (t-test p-value <.05) between various groups. This was sufficient for a meaningful bioinformatics evaluation; showing e.g. increased abundance of proteins in cancer in the KEGG ribosome pathway, GO mRNA splicing via spliceosome, and chromatin assembly biological processes. The results highlight the feasibility of the developed method for future large-scale tissue proteomics studies using commercially available TMAs.""","""['Lilla Turiák', 'Oliver Ozohanics', 'Gábor Tóth', 'András Ács', 'Ágnes Révész', 'Károly Vékey', 'András Telekes', 'László Drahos']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Proteomics""","""['Protocols for Tissue Microarrays in Prostate Cancer Studies.', 'Immunohistochemical biomarker validation in highly selective needle biopsy microarrays derived from mpMRI-characterized prostates.', 'Direct cancer tissue proteomics: a method to identify candidate cancer biomarkers from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissues.', 'The role of tissue microarrays in prostate cancer biomarker discovery.', 'Practical aspects of planning, building, and interpreting tissue microarrays: the Cooperative Prostate Cancer Tissue Resource experience.', 'Spatially Resolved Proteomic and Transcriptomic Profiling of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-Rearranged Pulmonary Adenocarcinomas Reveals Key Players in Inter- and Intratumoral Heterogeneity.', 'Compositional Analysis of Glycosaminoglycans in Different Lung Cancer Types-A Pilot Study.', 'Activation-Free Sulfonyl Fluoride Probes for Fragment Screening.', 'Optimized Sample Preparation and Microscale Separation Methods for High-Sensitivity Analysis of Hydrophilic Peptides.', 'Glycosaminoglycan Analysis of FFPE Tissues from Prostate Cancer and Benign Prostate Hyperplasia Patients Reveals Altered Regulatory Functions and Independent Markers for Survival.']"""

Methods::   Four established techniques were investigated and their accuracy assessed via dose calculations: (1) applying a standard planning CT (pCT) calibration curve, (2) applying a CBCT site-specific calibration curve, (3) performing a density override and (4) using deformable registration. Each technique was applied to 15 patients receiving volumetric modulated arc therapy to one of three treatment sites, head and neck, lung and prostate. Differences between pCT and CBCT recalculations were determined with dose volume histogram metrics and 2.0%/0.1 mm gamma analysis using the pCT dose distribution as a reference.  Results::   Dose volume histogram analysis indicated that all techniques yielded differences from expected results between 0.0 and 2.3% for both target volumes and organs at risk. With volumetric gamma analysis, the dose recalculation on deformed images yielded the highest pass-rates. The median pass-rate ranges at 50% threshold were 99.6-99.9%, 94.6-96.0%, and 94.8.0-96.0% for prostate, head and neck and lung patients, respectively.  Conclusion::   Deformable registration, HU override and site-specific calibration curves were all identified as dosimetrically accurate and efficient methods for dose calculation on CBCT images.  Advances in knowledge::   With the increasing adoption of CBCT, this study provides clinical radiotherapy departments with invaluable information regarding the comparison of dose reconstruction methods, enabling a more accurate representation of a patient's treatment.

Patients and methods:   In all, 176 patients underwent freehand TP prostate biopsies from May 2016 to November 2017. The procedure was carried out either under LA alone or with the addition of sedation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were reported using the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS), version 2. Tolerability was assessed using a visual analogue scale pain score for each procedural stage. Histopathological outcomes and complications were recorded.  Results:   The mean (range) age was 65 (36-83) years, median (range) prostate-specific antigen level was 7.9 (0.7-1374) ng/mL, and the mean (range) prostate volume 45 (15-157) mL. Biopsies were taken under LA alone (160 patients, 90%) or under LA with sedation (16, 9%). The main indication for biopsy was primary diagnosis (88.6%). In all, 91 (52%) patients underwent systematic TP biopsies (mean 24.2 cores). Cognitive MRI-targeted biopsies alone were performed in 45 patients (26%; mean 6.8 cores), and 40 (23%) had both systematic and target biopsies (mean 27.9 cores). Of the 75 patients who had primary systematic biopsies alone, 46 (61%) were positive, and 28/46 (60.9%) were diagnosed with clinically significant disease (Gleason ≥3+4). VAS pain scores were greatest during LA administration. There were five complications (2.8%, Clavien-Dindo Grade I/II). No patients developed urosepsis.

Previous short MD simulations (50 ns) suggested that the binding of abiraterone to CYP17A1 is stronger than that of TOK-001. In this work, by carrying out long atomistic MD simulations (200 ns) of CYP17A1 and its complexes with abiraterone and TOK-001, we observed a binding mode between CYP17A1 and abiraterone, which is different from the binding mode between CYP17A1 and TOK-001. In the case of abiraterone binding, the unfilled volume in the active site cavity increases the freedom of movement of abiraterone within CYP17A1, leading to the collective motions of the helices G and B' as well as the breaking of hydrogen bond existing between the 3β-OH group of abiraterone and N202 of CYP17A1. However, the unfilled volume in the active site cavity can be occupied by the benzimidazole ring of TOK-001, restraining the motion of TOK-001. By pulling the two inhibitors (abiraterone and TOK-001) out of the binding pocket in CYP17A1, we discovered that abiraterone and TOK-001 were moved from their binding sites to the surface of protein similarly through the channels formed by the helices G and B'. In addition, based on the free energy calculations, one can see that it is energetically favorable for the two inhibitors (abiraterone and TOK-001) to enter into the binding pocket in CYP17A1.""","""['Dalong Song', 'Jihua Zhang', 'Yuanlin Wang', 'Jianxin Hu', 'Shuxiong Xu', 'Yuangao Xu', 'Hujun Shen', 'Xiaopeng Wen', 'Zhaolin Sun']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Biomol Struct Dyn""","""['Structures of cytochrome P450 17A1 with prostate cancer drugs abiraterone and TOK-001.', 'Comparisons of Prostate Cancer Inhibitors Abiraterone and TOK-001 Binding with CYP17A1 through Molecular Dynamics.', 'Structural and Functional Evaluation of Clinically Relevant Inhibitors of Steroidogenic Cytochrome P450 17A1.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.', 'CYP17A1 inhibitors in prostate cancer: mechanisms of action independent of the androgenic pathway.']"""

Trophinin associated protein (TROAP) is essential for centrosome integrity and proper bipolar organisation of spindle assembly during mitosis and plays an essential role in proliferation. We found that TROAP expression correlates with patient survival and speculated that it may be involved in PCa progression. The Oncomine database tool (http://www.oncomine.org) was used to analyse TROAP mRNA expression from microarray data, and patient survival analysis for target genes was performed using the PROGgeneV2 Database (http://watson.compbio.iupui.edu). Gene interference with lentivirus was used to silence TROAP expression in PCa cells and knockdown efficiency was detected by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Cell viability, colony formation, cell cycle and apoptosis were then assessed to determine the function of TROAP in PCa cells. Markers of cell cycle and apoptosis were tested by western blotting. The correlation between WNT3 or survivin expression and TROAP transcripts in prostate cancer tissues was analysed using GEPIA (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn) and validated by western blotting. The in vivo role of TROAP was investigated using xenografts. This protein was overexpressed in PCa, and exhibited relatively higher expression in PCa cell lines, DU145 and 22Rv1. Importantly, analysing human cancer databases available from PROGgeneV2 showed that higher expression of TROAP is associated with shorter overall survival in prostate cancer patients. TROAP knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and led to cell cycle arrest at S phase in 22Rv1 and DU145 cells. Cell cycle arrest resulted in apoptosis in both cell lines via the cyclin A2-cyclin B1-caspase pathway. WNT3 and survivin expression levels were found to correlate with TROAP in PCa, and in vivo xenograft assays revealed that silencing of TROAP inhibited PCa tumour growth. Therefore, TROAP might represent a novel predictive marker to guide therapeutic intervention.""","""['Jianqing Ye', 'Chuanmin Chu', 'Ming Chen', 'Zhan Shi', 'Sishun Gan', 'Fajun Qu', 'Xiuwu Pan', 'Qiwei Yang', 'Yijun Tian', 'Lei Wang', 'Wei Yang', 'Xingang Cui']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['EZH2-TROAP Pathway Promotes Prostate Cancer Progression Via TWIST Signals.', 'Decreased expression of TROAP suppresses cellular proliferation, migration and invasion in gastric cancer.', 'TROAP regulates cell cycle and promotes tumor progression through Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway in glioma cells.', 'Knockdown of PYCR1 inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer.', 'Downregulation of the nucleosome-binding protein 1 (NSBP1) gene can inhibit the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of prostate cancer cells.', 'TROAP Promotes the Proliferation, Migration, and Metastasis of Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma with the Help of STAT3.', 'High expression of ABCF1 is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in bladder cancer.', 'Tastin promotes non-small-cell lung cancer progression through the ErbB4, PI3K/AKT, and ERK1/2 pathways.', 'Pan-cancer analysis of trophinin-associated protein with potential implications in clinical significance, prognosis, and tumor microenvironment in human cancers.', 'ASPM and TROAP gene expression as potential malignant tumor markers.']"""

Development of noninvasive imaging tools for improved characterization of prostate lesions might reduce overtreatment.  Purpose:   To measure the distribution of tissue sodium concentration (TSC), proton T2 -weighted signal, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in human PCa and to test the presence of a correlation between regional differences in imaging metrics and the Gleason grade of lesions determined from histopathology.  Study type:   Cross-sectional.  Subjects:   Ten men with biopsy-proven PCa.  Sequences/field strength:   Sodium, proton T2 -weighted, and diffusion-weighted MRI data were acquired using Broad-Band 3D-Fast-Gradient-Recalled, 3D Cube (Isotropic 3D-Fast-Turbo-Spin-Echo acquisition) and 2D Spin-Echo sequences, respectively, with a 3.0T MR scanner.  Assessment:   All imaging data were coregistered to Gleason-graded postprostatectomy histology, as the standard for prostate cancer lesion characterization. Regional TSC and T2 data were assessed using percent changes from healthy tissue of the same patient (denoted ΔTSC, ΔT2 ).  Statistics:   Differences in ΔTSC, ADC, and ΔT2 as a function of Gleason score were analyzed for each imaging contrast using a one-way analysis of variance or a nonparametric t-test. Correlations between imaging data measures and Gleason score were assessed using a Spearman's ranked correlation.  Results:   Evaluation of the correlation of ΔTSC, ADC, and ΔT2 datasets with Gleason scoring revealed that only the correlation between ΔTSC and Gleason score was statistically significant (rs = 0.791, p < 0.01), whereas the correlations of ADC and ΔT2 with Gleason score were not (rs = -0.306, p = 0.079 and r s = -0.069, p = 0.699, respectively). In addition, all individual patients showed monotonically increasing ΔTSC with Gleason score.  Data conclusion:   The results of this preliminary study suggest that changes in TSC, assessed by sodium MRI, has utility as a noninvasive imaging assay to accurately characterize PCa lesions. Sodium MRI may provide useful complementary information on mpMRI, which may assist the decision-making of men choosing either active surveillance or treatment.

Expression levels of CEBPA have been suggested to be prognostic in various tumor types.  Methods:   Here, we analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of CEBPA in a tissue microarray containing more than 17 000 prostate cancer specimens with annotated clinical and molecular data including for example TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and PTEN deletion status.  Results:   Normal prostate glands showed moderate to strong CEBPA staining, while CEBPA expression was frequently reduced (40%) or lost (30%) in prostate cancers. Absence of detectable CEBPA expression was markedly more frequent in ERG negative (45%) as compared to ERG positive cancers (20%, P < 0.0001). Reduced CEBPA expression was linked to unfavorable phenotype (P < 0.0001) and poor prognosis (P = 0.0008). Subgroup analyses revealed, that the prognostic value of CEBPA loss was entirely driven by tumors carrying both TMPRSS2:ERG fusions and PTEN deletions. In this subgroup, CEBPA loss was tightly linked to advanced tumor stage (P < 0.0001), high Gleason grade (P < 0.0001), positive nodal stage (0.0003), and early biochemical recurrence (P = 0.0007), while these associations were absent or markedly diminished in tumors with normal PTEN copy numbers and/or absence of ERG fusion.  Conclusions:   CEBPA is down regulated in about one third of prostate cancers, but the clinical impact of CEBPA loss is strictly limited to the subset of about 10% prostate cancers carrying both ERG fusion and deletions of the PTEN tumor suppressor.

However, the final histological examination may reveal that concordance rates between biopsy and pathological Gleason sums are inadequate.  Aim:   To evaluate the concordance of Gleason score between prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimen and to study factors predictive of up-grading of Gleason score at radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   We conducted a descriptive and retrospective study including cases of patients who underwent prostatectomy between 2008 and 2015. We proceeded to a histological examination of 30 cases of radical prostatectomy and 17 corresponding biopsies. The data of the remaining 13 prostate biopsies, not performed in our hospital, have been picked from detailed histological reports.  Results:   Our results showed that the concordance in the Gleason score was 43% (kappa = 0.11, poor agreement).Gleason score was upgraded in 54% of the cases. At radical prostatectomy, it increased by two points in one case and by one point in 14 cases. The Gleason score was under-graded on prostatic biopsies in an only 1 case. Using the new classification ISUP 2014, the concordance rate was 26% (kappa = 0.04, very poor agreement). Gleason score was upgraded in 78% of the cases for Group 1 (SG 3 + 3) and 63% for group 2 (SG 3 + 4). The concordance rate was highest for Group 4 (4 + 3). Variables as age, serum PSA (prostate specific antigen) , numbre of cores, percentage of positive cores, or prostate volume were not significant predictors of upgrading of Gleason score on radical prostatectomy specimen.

As a secondary endpoint, we assessed the community-level effect of neoadjuvant ADT on positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   Using the National Cancer Database (2004-2014), we identified patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa) [cT1-4N0M0] treated with RP. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) mixed linear regression methodology was used for temporal trend analysis of neoadjuvant ADT. Observed differences in baseline characteristics between patients treated with neoadjuvant ADT versus those who were not were then controlled for using an inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) approach. IPTW-adjusted analyses were then performed to examine the odds of positive surgical margins.  Results:   Overall, 8184 (2.12%) and 377,843 (97.88%) individuals with PCa were treated with neoadjuvant ADT prior to RP versus RP only, respectively. There was a consistent trend in decreasing use of neoadjuvant ADT over time, with a nadir observed in 2011 [EAPC - 8.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) - 11.7 to - 4.32; p < 0.05]. In IPTW-adjusted analyses, the odds of positive surgical margins were lower in patients receiving neoadjuvant ADT with low-risk [odds ratio (OR) 0.65; 95% CI 0.51-0.84; p < 0.001] and intermediate-risk [OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.69-0.85; p < 0.001] PCa.

Herein, an evaluation of in-house library discovered substituted pyranopyrazole as a novel scaffold for AKR1C3 inhibitors. Preliminary SAR exploration identified its derivative 19d as the most promising compound with an IC50 of 0.160 μM among the 23 synthesized molecules. Crystal structure studies revealed that the binding mode of the pyranopyrazole scaffold is different from the current inhibitors. Hydroxyl, methoxy and nitro group at the C4-phenyl substituent together anchor the inhibitor to the oxyanion site, while the core of the scaffold dramatically enlarges but partially occupies the SP pockets with abundant hydrogen bond interactions. Strikingly, the inhibitor undergoes a conformational change to fit AKR1C3 and its homologous protein AKR1C1. Our results suggested that conformational changes of the receptor and the inhibitor should both be considered during the rational design of selective AKR1C3 inhibitors.

We disclose a highly sensitive method for rapid and direct quantification of circulating miRNA in serum by combining dynamic DNA circuit and single-molecule fluorescence detection. The product of DNA circuits based amplification is detected by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). The single-molecule counting allows the quantification of miRNA targets. Owing to the high sensitivity for fluorophore labeled nucleic acids of TIRFM, the products generated by 15 min amplification are sufficient for quantification. Meanwhile, the fast detection also addresses the problem of leakage because non-target triggered DNA circuits is relatively slow. There miRNA biomarkers miR-141, miR-21, miR-16 were detected with remarkable sensitivity as detection limits of 0.017, 0.012, 0.006 fM, respectively.

However, most current PCa animal models are based on the injection of cancer cells into the blood circulation and bypass the first steps of the metastatic cascade, hence failing to investigate the influence of the primary tumor microenvironment on PCa metastasis. Here, we investigated the spontaneous metastasis of PC3 human PCa cells from humanized prostate tissue, containing cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and prostate lymphatic and blood vessel endothelial cells (BVEC), to humanized tissue-engineered bone constructs (hTEBC) in NOD-SCID IL2Rγnull (NSG) mice. The hTEBC formed a physiologically mature organ bone which allowed homing of metastatic PCa cells. Humanization of prostate tissue had no significant effect on the tumor burden at the primary site over the 4 weeks following intraprostatic injection, yet reduced the incidence and burden of metastases in the hTEBC. Spontaneous PCa metastases were detected in the lungs and spleen with no significant differences between the humanized and non-humanized prostate groups. A significantly greater metastatic tumor burden was observed in the liver when metastasis occurred from the humanized prostate. Together, our data suggests that the presence of human-derived CAFs and BVECs in the primary PCa microenvironment influences selectively the metastatic and homing behavior of PC3 cells in this model.

This study aimed to analyze the association between KIF22 and clinical outcome in PCa patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of KIF22 in tumor specimens compared with paired paracancerous tissue from 114 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy was detected by immunohistochemistry; results were verified using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Subsequently, the relationship between KIF22 expression and clinical prognosis of PCa patients was then statistically analyzed. RESULTS Both immunohistochemistry and database analysis showed that KIF22 was obviously overexpressed in PCa tissues compared with paracancerous tissue. The overexpression of KIF22 at the protein level was significantly related to higher clinical stage (P=0.025), Gleason score (P=0.002), seminal vesicle invasion (P=0.007), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.009). Furthermore, with the overexpression of KIF22 mRNA level in PCa patients, the oncological prognosis of PCa patients was much poorer.

Methods:   The authors identified 595 AAM and CM who received ADT for a BCR that developed after RP between 1988 and 2015 in the Shared Equal-Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database. Univariable and multivariable Cox models were used to test the association between race and the time from ADT to metastases. Secondary outcomes included the time to CRPC, all-cause mortality, and prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 66 months after ADT, 62 of 354 CM (18%) and 38 of 241 AAM (16%) developed metastases. AAM were younger at the time they received ADT (63 vs 67 years; P < .001), had received ADT in a more recent year (2008 vs 2006; P < .001), had higher prostate-specific antigen levels at RP (11.1 vs 9.2 ng/mL; P < .001), lower pathologic Gleason scores (P = .004), and less extracapsular extension (38% vs 48%; P = .022). On multivariable analysis, there was no association between race and metastases (hazard radio, 1.20; P = .45) or any of the other secondary outcomes (all P > .5).  Conclusions:   Among veterans who received ADT post-BCR after RP, race was not a predictor of metastases or other adverse outcomes. The current findings suggest that research efforts to understand racial differences in prostate cancer biology should focus on early stages of the disease (ie, closer to the time of diagnosis).""","""['Adriana C Vidal', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Amanda De Hoedt', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Martha K Terris', 'William J Aronson', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Christopher L Amling', 'Stanislav Lechpammer', 'Scott C Flanders', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Race and risk of metastases and survival after radical prostatectomy: Results from the SEARCH database.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Herein, the authors performed a phase 2, single-arm study that was designed to assess the safety of abiraterone acetate without steroids in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   Eligible patients had castration-resistant prostate cancer with controlled blood pressure and normal potassium. Patients initially received abiraterone acetate at a dose of 1000 mg daily alone. Those with persistent or severe mineralocorticoid toxicity received treatment with prednisone initiated at a dose of 5 mg twice daily. Therapy was continued until radiographic progression, toxicity, or withdrawal. The primary objective of the current study was to determine the percentage of men requiring prednisone to manage mineralocorticoid toxicity. Toxicity was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.  Results:   A total of 58 patients received at least 1 dose of abiraterone acetate; the majority had metastases (53 patients; 91.4%). Sixteen patients (27.6%) received prior chemotherapy, 6 patients (10.3%) received prior enzalutamide, and 4 patients (7%) received prior ketoconazole. Grade 3 to 4 adverse events of interest included hypertension (9 patients; 15.5%) and hypokalemia (4 patients; 7%). There was no grade ≥3 edema. Seven patients (12%) initiated prednisone therapy for mineralocorticoid toxicity, 3 patients for hypertension (5%), and 4 patients for hypokalemia (7%). Two patients initiated prednisone therapy for fatigue (3%). Forty patients (68%) experienced a decline in prostate-specific antigen of ≥50% with the use of abiraterone acetate alone. Patients with lower baseline levels of androstenedione (P = .04), androsterone (P = .01), dehydroepiandrosterone (P = .03), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (P = .03) were found to be more likely to develop mineralocorticoid toxicity.

Among the most explored structure moieties, hydroxybenzamides and hydroxypropenamides have been demonstrated to have potential HDAC inhibitory effects. Several compounds of these structural classes have been approved for clinical uses to treat different types of cancer, such as givinostat (ITF2357) and belinostat (PXD-101).  Aims:   This study aims at developing novel HDAC inhibitors bearing N-hydroxybenzamides and Nhydroxypropenamides scaffolds with potential cytotoxicity against different cancer cell lines.  Methods:   Two new series of N-hydroxybenzamides and N-hydroxypropenamides analogues (4a-j, 6a-j) designed based on the structural features of nexturastat A, AR-42, and PXD-101, were synthesized and evaluated for HDAC inhibitory potency as well as cytotoxicity against three human cancer cell lines (SW620 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), PC3 (prostate adenocarcinoma), and NCI-H23 (adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer). Molecular simulations were finally carried out to gain more insight into the structure-activity relationships.  Results:   It was found that the N-hydroxypropenamides (6a-e) displayed very good HDAC inhibitory potency and cytotoxicity. Various compounds, e.g. 6a-e, especially compound 6e, were up to 5-fold more potent than suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA) in terms of cytotoxicity. These compounds also comparably inhibited HDACs with IC50 values in the sub-micromolar range. Docking experiments showed that these compounds bound to HDAC2 at the enzyme active binding site with the same binding mode of SAHA, but with higher binding affinities.

In particular, developing resistance to cabazitaxel is a major challenge in patients with docetaxel-resistant and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) because cabazitaxel is often administered as a last resort. However, the mechanism by which cabazitaxel resistance develops is still unclear. C-C motif chemokine ligands (CCL) were shown to contribute to the castration resistance of prostate cancer cells via an autocrine mechanism. Therefore, we focused on CCL as key factors of chemoresistance in prostate cancer cells. We previously established a cabazitaxel-resistant cell line, DU145-TxR/CxR, from a previously established paclitaxel-resistant cell line, DU145-TxR. cDNA microarray analysis revealed that the expression of CCL2 was upregulated in both DU145-TxR and DU145-TxR/CxR cells compared with DU145 cells. The secreted CCL2 protein level in DU145-TxR and DU145-TxR/CxR cells was also higher than in parental DU145 cells. The stimulation of DU145 cells with CCL2 increased the proliferation rate under treatments with cabazitaxel, and a CCR2 (a specific receptor of CCL2) antagonist suppressed the proliferation of DU145-TxR and DU145-TxR/CxR cells under treatments of cabazitaxel. The CCL2-CCR2 axis decreased apoptosis through the inhibition of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). CCL2 is apparently a key contributor to cabazitaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of the CCL2-CCR2 axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy against chemoresistant CRPC in combination with cabazitaxel.""","""['Ariunbold Natsagdorj', 'Kouji Izumi', 'Kaoru Hiratsuka', 'Kazuaki Machioka', 'Hiroaki Iwamoto', 'Renato Naito', 'Tomoyuki Makino', 'Suguru Kadomoto', 'Kazuyoshi Shigehara', 'Yoshifumi Kadono', 'Wen-Jye Lin', 'Aerken Maolake', 'Atsushi Mizokami']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['The CCL2-CCR2 Axis Contributes to Migration of Cabazitaxel-resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Establishment and characterization of two cabazitaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical profile of cabazitaxel.', 'Investigation of enzalutamide, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel resistance in the castration resistant prostate cancer cell line C4 using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer - microenvironmental roles of adipose tissue.', 'KLF15 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer by downregulating CCL2 and CCL7.', 'Serum CCL2 Is a Prognostic Biomarker for Non-Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'CC Chemokine Ligand-2: A Promising Target for Overcoming Anticancer Drug Resistance.']"""

Our aim was to evaluate immediate urinary continence (UC) recovery in a single-surgeon prospective randomized comparative study between the traditional robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (TR-RALP) and the Retzius-sparing RALP (RS-RALP), for the treatment of the clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   102 consecutive PCa patients were prospectively randomized to TR-RALP (57) or RS-RALP (45). Postoperative continence was defined as patient-reported absence of leakage or use of 0 pads/day. The immediate continence rate and 95% confidence interval (CI 95%) were calculated for each treatment. Univariable and multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess predictors of immediate continence following RALP. Continence rates from 1 to 6 months were calculated by Kaplan-Meier curves; log-rank test was used for the curve comparison. Two analyses were performed, considering a per-protocol (PP) population regarding all randomized patients that received nerve-sparing RALP and an Intention-To-Treat (ITT) population regarding all randomized patients that received RALP.  Results:   In the PP analysis, the rates of immediate continence were 12/40 (30%) (CI 95% 17-47%) for the TR-RALP and 20/39 (51.3%) (CI 95% 35-68%) for the RS-RALP (p = 0.05). In the ITT analysis, the corresponding rates were 12/57 (21%) (CI 95% 11-34%) for the TR-RALP and 23/45 (51%) (CI 95% 36-66%) for the RS-RALP (p = 0.001). Median time to continence was 21 days for the TR-RALP and 1 day for RS-RALP, respectively (p = 0.02). The relative Kaplan-Meier curves regarding continence resulted statistically different when compared with the log rank test (p = 0.02). In the multivariate analysis, lower age and the Retzius-sparing approach were significantly associated to earlier continence recovery.

Drug combination therapy is known as a powerful tool for the treatment of cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the synergistic inhibitory mechanisms of clofoctol and sorafenib in the treatment of prostate cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon have not been illuminated clearly. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of clofoctol in combination with sorafenib in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   The activity and mechanism of clofoctol in combination with sorafenib were examined in PC-3cells. mRNA and protein expression of key players in the ER stress pathway were detected with RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cell viability was estimated by CCK-8 assay or Alamar blue assay, and apoptosis and cell cycle were monitored and measured by flow cytometry. PC-3 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in male BALB/c nude mice. The therapeutic regimen was initiated when the tumor began showing signs of growth and treatment continued for 5 weeks.  Results:   Our data indicate that clofototol and sorafenib induce cell death through synergistic induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, resulting in activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Combination therapy with clofoctol and sorafenib induced an upregulation of markers of all three ER stress pathways: PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. In addition, combination therapy with clofoctol and sorafenib markedly inhibited the growth of prostate cancer xenograft tumors, compared with clofoctol or sorafenib alone.  Conclusion:   The combination of clofoctol and sorafenib can serve as a novel clinical treatment regimen, potentially enhancing antitumor efficacy in prostate cancer and decreasing the dose and adverse effects of either clofoctol or sorafenib alone.

The feasibility of sentinel LN (SLN) visualization on MRI after intraprostatic SPION injection has been reported. In the present study, results of preoperative MRI identification of SLNs and the outcome of subsequent intraoperative magnetometer-guided sLND following intraprostatic SPION injection were studied in intermediate- and high-risk PCa.  Patients and methods:   A total of 50 intermediate- and high-risk PCa patients (prostate-specific antigen >10 ng/mL and/or Gleason score ≥7) scheduled for radical prostatectomy with magnetometer-guided sLND and extended pelvic LND (eLND), were included. Patients underwent MRI before and one day after intraprostatic SPION injection using T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted sequences. Diagnostic rate per patient was established. Distribution of SLNs per anatomic region was registered. Diagnostic accuracy of sLND was assessed by using eLND as a reference standard.  Results:   SPION-MRI identified a total of 890 SLNs (median 17.5; IQR 12-22.5). SLNs could be successfully detected using MRI in all patients (diagnostic rate 100%). Anatomic SLN distribution: external iliac 19.2%, common iliac 16.6%, fossa obturatoria 15.8%, internal iliac 13.8%, presacral 12.1%, perirectal 12.0%, periprostatic 3.7%, perivesical 2.3%, and other regions 4.4%.

In this study, we examine the association between prediagnostic concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] and the risk of prostate cancer overall and by tumor characteristics. Principal investigators of 19 prospective studies provided individual participant data on circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D for up to 13,462 men with incident prostate cancer and 20,261 control participants. ORs for prostate cancer by study-specific fifths of season-standardized vitamin D concentration were estimated using multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression. 25(OH)D concentration was positively associated with risk for total prostate cancer (multivariable-adjusted OR comparing highest vs. lowest study-specific fifth was 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.31; P trend < 0.001). However, this association varied by disease aggressiveness (P heterogeneity = 0.014); higher circulating 25(OH)D was associated with a higher risk of nonaggressive disease (OR per 80 percentile increase = 1.24, 1.13-1.36) but not with aggressive disease (defined as stage 4, metastases, or prostate cancer death, 0.95, 0.78-1.15). 1,25(OH)2D concentration was not associated with risk for prostate cancer overall or by tumor characteristics. The absence of an association of vitamin D with aggressive disease does not support the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency increases prostate cancer risk. Rather, the association of high circulating 25(OH)D concentration with a higher risk of nonaggressive prostate cancer may be influenced by detection bias. SIGNIFICANCE: This international collaboration comprises the largest prospective study on blood vitamin D and prostate cancer risk and shows no association with aggressive disease but some evidence of a higher risk of nonaggressive disease.""","""['Ruth C Travis', 'Aurora Perez-Cornago', 'Paul N Appleby', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Corinne E Joshu', 'Pamela L Lutsey', 'Alison M Mondul', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Stephanie J Weinstein', 'Tracy M Layne', 'Kathy J Helzlsouer', 'Kala Visvanathan', 'Domenico Palli', 'Petra H Peeters', 'Bas Bueno-de-Mesquita', 'Antonia Trichopoulou', 'Marc J Gunter', 'Konstantinos K Tsilidis', 'Maria-Jose Sánchez', 'Anja Olsen', 'Hermann Brenner', 'Ben Schöttker', 'Laura Perna', 'Bernd Holleczek', 'Paul Knekt', 'Harri Rissanen', 'Bu B Yeap', 'Leon Flicker', 'Osvaldo P Almeida', 'Yuen Yee Elizabeth Wong', 'June M Chan', 'Edward L Giovannucci', 'Meir J Stampfer', 'Giske Ursin', 'Randi E Gislefoss', 'Tone Bjørge', 'Haakon E Meyer', 'Rune Blomhoff', 'Shoichiro Tsugane', 'Norie Sawada', 'Dallas R English', 'Darryl W Eyles', 'Alicia K Heath', 'Elizabeth J Williamson', 'Jonas Manjer', 'Johan Malm', 'Martin Almquist', 'Loic Le Marchand', 'Christopher A Haiman', 'Lynne R Wilkens', 'Jeannette M Schenk', 'Cathy M Tangen', 'Amanda Black', 'Michael B Cook', 'Wen-Yi Huang', 'Regina G Ziegler', 'Richard M Martin', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'David E Neal', 'Mathilde Touvier', 'Serge Hercberg', 'Pilar Galan', 'Mélanie Deschasaux', 'Timothy J Key', 'Naomi E Allen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Serum vitamin D concentration and prostate cancer risk: a nested case-control study.', 'A prospective study of plasma vitamin D metabolites, vitamin D receptor polymorphisms, and prostate cancer.', 'Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, vitamin D binding protein and risk of advanced and lethal prostate cancer.', 'Associations of circulating and dietary vitamin D with prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.', 'Plasma vitamin D levels, menopause, and risk of breast cancer: dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies.', 'Associations of intakes of total protein, protein from dairy sources, and dietary calcium with risks of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer: a prospective analysis in UK Biobank.', 'Workplace exposure to UV radiation and strategies to minimize cancer risk.', 'Dietary Patterns and Prostate Cancer: CAPLIFE Study.', 'Applying Mendelian randomization to appraise causality in relationships between nutrition and cancer.', 'Hair dye use and prostate cancer risk: A prospective analysis in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort.']"""

However, there is considerable uncertainty about the optimal follow-up schedule in terms of the tests to perform and their frequency.  Objective:   To assess the costs and benefits of different AS follow-up strategies compared to watchful waiting (WW) or immediate treatment.  Design, setting, and participants:   A state-transition Markov model was developed to simulate the natural history (ie, no testing or intervention) of prostate cancer for a hypothetical cohort of 50-yr-old men newly diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer. Following diagnosis, men were hypothetically managed with immediate treatment, watchful waiting, or one of several AS strategies. AS follow-up was performed either with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which was scheduled annually, biennially, every 3yrs, according to the PRIAS protocol (yrs 1, 4, 7, and 10, and then every 5yr) or every 5yr. Diagnosis of higher-grade or -stage disease while on AS resulted in curative treatment.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We measured discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted lifetime medical costs (2017 US$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).  Results and limitations:   Compared to WW, MRI-based surveillance performed every 5yr improved quality-adjusted survival by 4.47 quality-adjusted months and represented high-value health care at the Medicare reimbursement rate using standard cost-effectiveness metrics. Biopsy-based strategies were less effective and less costly than the corresponding MRI-based strategies for each testing interval. MRI-based surveillance at more frequent intervals had ICERs greater than $800000 per QALY and would not be considered cost-effective according to standard metrics. Our results were sensitive to the diagnostic accuracy and costs of both biopsy modes in detecting clinically significant cancer.  Conclusions:   Incorporation of MRI into surveillance protocols at Medicare reimbursement rates and decreasing the intensity of repeat testing may be cost-effective options for men opting for conservative management of low-risk prostate cancer.  Patient summary:   Our study modeled outcomes for men with low-risk prostate cancer undergoing watchful waiting, immediate treatment, or active surveillance with different follow-up schedules. We found that conservative management of low-risk disease optimizes health outcomes and costs. Furthermore, we showed that decreasing the intensity of active surveillance follow-up and incorporating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into surveillance protocols can be cost-effective, depending on the MRI costs.""","""['Niranjan J Sathianathen', 'Badrinath R Konety', 'Fernando Alarid-Escudero', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Damien M Bolton', 'Karen M Kuntz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""[""Reply to Diana A.

Paired theranostic agents have the potential to visually identify phenotypes that will respond to targeted therapy. This study examined the value of 68Ga-HBEDD PSMA-11; prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) in predicting treatment response and disease progression in Lu-PSMA therapy within the context of a phase 2 prospective pilot trial.  Patients and methods:   Men with progressive, symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with antiandrogens (abiraterone and/or enzalutamide) and taxane-based chemotherapy were prospectively enrolled. Eligibility criteria included uptake on PSMA PET above or equal to liver activity, with no 18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET-discordant disease. Men received up to 4 cycles of Lu-PSMA at 6 weekly intervals. Repeat FDG/PSMA PET imaging was performed after completion of therapy or at prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression. The study assessed treatment response to Lu-PSMA using PSA response and correlated treatment response (PSA) to molecular imaging parameters at enrollment.  Results:   Fourteen of 18 men screened underwent Lu-PSMA therapy. Ten (71%) of 14 had a PSA response (mean reduction, 59%). A ≥ 50% reduction in PSA occurred in 5 (36%), and ≥ 30% in 9 (64%). PSMA PET standardized uptake value (SUV) at screening was predictive of ≥ 30% PSA reduction: SUV max value 17 ± 9 versus 44 ± 15 (P < .007), and PSMA SUV mean 6 ± 4 versus 10 ± 4 (P < .04). FDG parameters alone, and volume or site of disease did not predict PSA response. No imaging parameters predicted ≥ 50% PSA reduction. Nine of 14 men were reimaged after treatment, revealing 3 distinct patterns of progression.  Conclusion:   PSMA PET plays an important role in predicting treatment response to Lu-PSMA and in identifying subsequent patterns of failure, which may aid in determining the next best treatment options.""","""['Louise Emmett', 'Megan Crumbaker', 'Bao Ho', 'Kathy Willowson', 'Peter Eu', 'Lalith Ratnayake', 'Richard Epstein', 'Ashley Blanksby', 'Lisa Horvath', 'Alex Guminski', 'Kate Mahon', 'Craig Gedye', 'Charlotte Yin', 'Phillip Stricker', 'Anthony M Joshua']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['177LuLu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (TheraP): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.', 'The Prognostic Value of Posttreatment 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 and NOX66 in a Phase I/II Trial (LuPIN).', '177Lu-PSMA-617 radionuclide treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (LuPSMA trial): a single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 study.', 'A Walk with Lu-177 PSMA: How Close we Have Reached from Bench to Bedside?', 'Therapeutic Responses and Survival Effects of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.', 'Joint EANM/SNMMI procedure guideline for the use of 177Lu-labeled PSMA-targeted radioligand-therapy (177Lu-PSMA-RLT).', 'A Review of Modern Imaging Landscape for Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Clinical Guide.', 'Pharmacological Optimization of PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy.', 'Single Center Experience with a 4-Week 177Lu-PSMA-617 Treatment Interval in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Current Status of PSMA-Targeted Radioligand Therapy in the Era of Radiopharmaceutical Therapy Acquiring Marketing Authorization.']"""

Materials and methods:   79 patients were treated with brachytherapy under HS. The Visual Analog Scale questionnaire was used to assess comfort and anxiety and the lowest, mean, and highest level of pain. Data for 79 patients who underwent general anesthesia (GA) and 37 patients who underwent spinal anesthesia (SA) treated at the same period were compared with HS group in terms of medication and treatment duration.  Results:   11 patients (13.9%) requested a GA, because they did not reach the hypnotic level. For the remaining 68 patients, the mean pain and comfort scores evaluated just after the intervention were 3.1 and 7.4, respectively. At 8 weeks, the scores were 2.8 and 7.5, respectively. 66 patients (97%) would choose this approach again and recommend it to other patients. The patients in the HS group received significant less medications than in the GA (remifentanil, propofol, kétamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine…) or SA (sufentanil, midazolam, morphine, bupivacaine…) groups with mean values of 3.1 vs. 7.9 vs. 5.6 (p < 0.0001), respectively. HS increased the mean time of surgery room occupation by 12 min vs. GA and by 20 min vs. SA. However, the recovery room occupation is avoided with HS (GA = 61 min and SA = 67 min) and a shorter duration of a need for a urinary catheter was noted.

The current research aims to investigate caveolin-1 expression in prostate cancer tissue and its relationship with pathological grade, clinical pathologic staging, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Methods:   From January 2012 to December 2014, samples from 47 patients with prostate cancer who had received transurethral prostatic resection (TURP) and 20 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University.

The results were statistically analyzed for pathological grade, clinical stage, and preoperative PSA level.  Results:   The expression of caveolin-1 was significantly higher in prostate cancer samples than in benign prostatic hyperplasia samples (P < 0.05), and caveolin-1 expression was significantly different among the pathological grades of poorly, moderately and well-differentiated prostate cancer (P < 0.05). The difference in caveolin-1 expression was significant for different clinical stages (T1-T2 and T3-T4) of prostate cancer (P < 0.05). The difference in caveolin-1 expression was not significant among samples with different preoperative PSA levels (0-10, 10-100 and > 100 μg/L) (P > 0.05).

In this work, using a panel of PCa cell lines in comparison with a non-tumoral prostate cell line, we combined cytogenetic approaches with radiocytotoxicity assays to obtain significant insights into the cellular consequences of exposure to 64CuCl₂. PCa cells were found to exhibit increased 64CuCl₂ uptake, which could not be attributed to increased expression of the main copper cellular importer, hCtr1, as had been previously suggested. Early DNA damage and genomic instability were also higher in PCa cells, with the tumoral cell lines exhibiting deficient DNA-damage repair upon exposure to 64CuCl₂. This was corroborated by the observation that 64CuCl₂ was more cytotoxic in PCa cells than in non-tumoral cells.

Here we found the expression of Beclin 1 was decreased in both Enz-resistant (EnzR) cell lines (EnzR1-C4-2 and EnzR2-C4-2B) as compared to their parental Enz-sensitive (EnzS) (EnzS1-C4-2 and EnzS2-C4-2B) cells, and targeting the Beclin 1 could lead to increase the Enz-sensitivity in these two CRPC cell lines. Mechanism dissection revealed that Enz might function via altering the interaction between Beclin 1 and the androgen receptor (AR) to decrease the activity of Beclin 1/Vps15/Vps34 complex thus increasing the ERK-mediated growth factor signaling to alter the Enz sensitivity. Interrupting the AR-Beclin 1/ERK signaling with ectopic BECN1 or ERK inhibitor led to alter the Enz sensitivity in both EnzR1-C4-2 and EnzR2-C4-2B cells compared to EnzS1-C4-2 and EnzS2-C4-2B cells, respectively.

However, ps20 remains largely uncharacterised with respect to its structure and interacting partners. This study characterised the evolution, functionality and structural characteristics of WFDC1/ps20 using phylogenetic reconstruction and other computational approaches. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses suggested that ps20 appeared in a common ancestor of deuterostomes-protostomes. The rate of evolutionary change within the coding regions of vertebrate WFDC1 genes and the synteny conservation in mammals differed from that of other vertebrate clades, indicating a possible functional diversity of ps20 homologues. A gene set enrichment analysis of the genes around WFDC1 (conserved synteny) showed functional relationships between the WFDC1, CDH13, CRISPLD2, IRF8 and TFPI2 genes. The molecular evolution of ps20 has been driven by purifying selection, particularly in the segments corresponding to exons 3 and 4, which encode the most conserved regions of the protein. A co-evolution analysis showed that residues within these regions co-vary with each other during the evolution of ps20. These results show that the regions corresponding to exons 3 and 4 are ps20-specific structure-function modules. Homology modelling of the exon 2-encoded polypeptide and subsequent dynamics calculus using a Gaussian network model showed that residues with high conformational flexibility are part of a loop region involved in protein-protein recognition, given the similarity with other serine protease inhibitors.

Relative risk of second nonmelanoma primary cancers was estimated from standardized incidence ratios with 95% confidence intervals. A total of 4,823 (12%) in situ melanoma survivors developed a second primary cancer. A small increased risk (6%) compared with the general population was found. In those younger than 50 years, risk was increased by 14% for all cancers combined. In situ melanoma survivors had significantly increased risks of developing lip, thyroid, pancreatic, and brain cancers and decreased risks of head and neck, and lung cancers. Male in situ melanoma survivors had a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer; female survivors had an increased risk of thyroid cancer and lymphoid leukemia. Findings indicate that in situ melanoma may predict the diagnosis of certain second primary cancers.

IGF2AS was overexpressed in VCaP and PC3 cells to assess its effect on PCa cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, and xenograft in vivo.

Variations of VHR criteria have been suggested to be prognostic in other single-center cohorts, but multicenter outcomes validating VHR criteria have not been described. This study was designed to validate VHR criteria for identifying which PCa patients are at greatest risk for cancer progression.  Methods:   Patients with high-risk PCa undergoing RP (2005-2015) at 3 tertiary centers were pooled. The outcomes of men with VHR PCa were compared with the outcomes of those who did not meet VHR criteria. The high-risk criteria were a clinical stage of T3 to T4, a prostate-specific antigen level > 20 ng/mL, or a biopsy Gleason grade sum of 8 to 10. The VHR criteria were multiple high-risk features, >4 biopsy cores with a Gleason grade sum of 8 to 10, or primary Gleason grade pattern 5. Biochemical recurrence, metastasis (METS), and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) were assessed with competing risks regressions. Overall mortality was assessed with Cox survival models.  Results:   Among 1981 patients with high-risk PCa, men with VHR PCa (n = 602) had adverse pathologic outcomes: 37% versus 25% for positive margins and 37% versus 15% for positive lymph nodes (P < .001 for both comparisons).

Owing to its modular structure, p130Cas acts as a general regulator of cancer cell growth and invasiveness induced by different oncogenes. However, other mechanisms of p130Cas signaling leading to malignant progression are poorly understood. Here, we show a novel interaction of p130Cas with Ser/Thr kinase PKN3, which is implicated in prostate and breast cancer growth downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. This direct interaction is mediated by the p130Cas SH3 domain and the centrally located PKN3 polyproline sequence. PKN3 is the first identified Ser/Thr kinase to bind and phosphorylate p130Cas and to colocalize with p130Cas in cell structures that have a pro-invasive function. Moreover, the PKN3-p130Cas interaction is important for mouse embryonic fibroblast growth and invasiveness independent of Src transformation, indicating a mechanism distinct from that previously characterized for p130Cas.

Design, setting, and participants:   In this population-based prospective cohort study among French adult volunteers, data were included from participants with available information on organic food consumption frequency and dietary intake. For 16 products, participants reported their consumption frequency of labeled organic foods (never, occasionally, or most of the time). An organic food score was then computed (range, 0-32 points).

Main outcomes and measures:   This study estimated the risk of cancer in association with the organic food score (modeled as quartiles) using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for potential cancer risk factors.  Results:   Among 68 946 participants (78.0% female; mean [SD] age at baseline, 44.2 [14.5] years), 1340 first incident cancer cases were identified during follow-up, with the most prevalent being 459 breast cancers, 180 prostate cancers, 135 skin cancers, 99 colorectal cancers, 47 non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and 15 other lymphomas.

Results:   Eighty-seven patients were enrolled for the study. Median number of LNs retrieved per patient was 26, specifically 13 and 12, on the left and right side, respectively. Seven of 24 (29.1%) right lobe positive biopsy showed positive LNs on the left side (one exclusively left, 6 bilateral LNMs). Again, 12 of 26 (46.1%) left lobe positive biopsy showed positive LNs on the right side (one exclusively right, 11 bilateral LNMs). No significant differences of performance to predict the side of LNMs were recorded in the SBx and TBx groups. Concerning RP specimens, only five of 22 (22.7%) right lobe dominant cases showed positive LNs on the left side (two exclusively left, 3 bilateral LN metastases). Again, none of 16 left lobe dominant cases showed positive LNs on the contralateral side (15 exclusively right, 1 bilateral LNMs).  Conclusions:   Our results suggest confirmed that a unilateral LN dissection limited to the tumor-bearing side of the gland evaluated by biopsy specimens should not be recommended due to the substantial risk of missing contralateral LNMs.""","""['Stefano De Luca', 'Roberto Passera', 'Cristian Fiori', 'Diletta Garrou', 'Matteo Manfredi', 'Roberta Aimar', 'Daniele Amparore', 'Enrico Checcucci', 'Enrico Bollito', 'Francesco Porpiglia']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Minerva Urol Nefrol""","""['Can side-specific biopsy findings predict the side of nodal metastasis in clinically localized prostate cancer?

It utilizes the preoperative MRI images of the prostate, mapping them intra-operatively, real time to the patient by magnetic tracking to fixed points of the pelvis. The system is comprised of a tablet computer with a touch screen display; a tracking system housed in a portable cart, a magnetic field generator and position sensors. It updates image data over 20 times per second to compensate with anatomical alterations during the operation. Four patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma were enrolled in this study. All four had negative surgical margins along with satisfactory functional recovery regarding continence and potency. The navigational accuracy and the real time information provided by the imaging system was mainly utilized in the more challenging parts of the operation including the apical dissection, the nerve sparing procedure and the bladder neck dissection.

We aim to characterize imaging of prostate tissue after radiation therapy (RT), using histopathology as ground truth, and to investigate the visibility of tumor lesions on mp-MRI.  Methods:   Tumor delineated histopathology slides from salvage radical prostatectomy patients, primarily treated with RT, were registered to MRI. Median T2-weighted, ADC, Ktrans, and kep values in tumor and other regions were calculated. Two radiologists independently performed mp-MRI-based tumor delineations which were compared with the true pathological extent. General linear mixed-effect modeling was used to establish the contribution of each imaging modality and combinations thereof in distinguishing tumor and benign voxels.  Results:   Nineteen of the 21 included patients had tumor in the available histopathology slides. Recurrence was predominantly multifocal with large tumor foci seen after external beam radiotherapy, whereas these were small and sparse after low-dose-rate brachytherapy. MRI-based delineations missed small foci and slightly underestimated tumor extent. The combination of T2-weighted, ADC, Ktrans, and kep had the best performance in distinguishing tumor and benign voxels.  Conclusions:   Using high-resolution histopathology delineations, the real tumor extent and size were found to be underestimated on MRI. mp-MRI obtained the best performance in identifying tumor voxels. Appropriate margins around the visible tumor-suspected region should be included when designing focal salvage strategies. Recurrent tumor delineation guidelines are warranted.  Key points:   • Compared to the use of individual sequences, multi-parametric MRI obtained the best performance in distinguishing recurrent tumor from benign voxels. • Delineations based on mp-MRI miss smaller foci and slightly underestimate tumor volume of local recurrent prostate cancer. • Focal salvage strategies should include appropriate margins around the visible tumor.""","""['Catarina Dinis Fernandes', 'Ghazaleh Ghobadi', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Jeroen de Jong', 'Stijn W T P J Heijmink', 'Ivo Schoots', 'Iris Walraven', 'Petra J van Houdt', 'Milena Smolic', 'Floris J Pos', 'Uulke A van der Heide']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Quantitative 3T multiparametric MRI of benign and malignant prostatic tissue in patients with and without local recurrent prostate cancer after external-beam radiation therapy.', 'Multiparametric MRI Tumor Probability Model for the Detection of Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy: Pathologic Validation and Comparison With Manual Tumor Delineations.', 'Clinically significant prostate cancer local recurrence after radiation therapy occurs at the site of primary tumor: magnetic resonance imaging and step-section pathology evidence.', 'Diagnosis and management of local recurrence after low-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Salvage therapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiation.', 'Risk-adaptive paradigm for focal versus whole-gland salvage treatment for radio-recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Defining radio-recurrent intra-prostatic target volumes using PSMA-targeted PET/CT and multi-parametric MRI.', 'Ex Vivo MR Histology and Cytometric Feature Mapping Connect Three-dimensional in Vivo MR Images to Two-dimensional Histopathologic Images of Murine Sarcomas.', 'Detection and staging of radio-recurrent prostate cancer using multiparametric MRI.', 'Quantitative 3T multiparametric MRI of benign and malignant prostatic tissue in patients with and without local recurrent prostate cancer after external-beam radiation therapy.']"""

Accurate prognosis is important as it is the principal factor in determining the treatment plan. Prostate cancer is a complex disease which advances in stages. While clinical failure (including metastasis) is a significant endpoint following a radical prostatectomy, it can often take years to manifest, usually too late to be optimistically treated. In practice, the earlier endpoint of PSA Recurrence is frequently used as a surrogate in prognostic modeling. The central issue in these models is managing censored observations which challenge traditional regression techniques. The true target times of a majority of instances are unknown; what is known is a censored target representing some earlier indeterminate time. In this work we apply a novel transduction approach for semi-supervised survival analysis which has previously been shown to be powerful in medical prognosis. The approach considers censored samples as semi-supervised regression targets leveraging the partial nature of unsupervised information. We explore the use of this approach in building prostate cancer progression models from multimodal characteristics extracted from both biopsy and prostatectomy tissues samples. In this work, the approach leads to a significant increase in performance for predicting advanced prostate cancer from earlier endpoints and may also be useful in other diseases for predicting advanced endpoints from earlier stages of the disease.""","""['Faisal M Khan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['PSA doubling time as a predictor of clinical progression after biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and pathologic outcome after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer patients with a preoperative Gleason sum of 8 to 10.', 'Prognostic factors for multifocal prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimens: lack of significance of secondary cancers.', 'Prostate specific antigen only progression of prostate cancer.', 'Controversies in the management of localized prostate cancer: radical prostatectomy still the standard of care.', 'Ultra pH-sensitive detection of total and free prostate-specific antigen using electrochemical aptasensor based on reduced graphene oxide/gold nanoparticles emphasis on TiO2/carbon quantum dots as a redox probe.']"""

It is not known, however, whether and to what extent lesions detected by these imaging techniques correlate with genomic features of PCa. The aim of this study was therefore to define a genomic index lesion based on chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) as marker for tumor aggressiveness in prostate biopsies in direct correlation to multiparametric (mp) MRI and 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT imaging features. CNA profiles of 46 biopsies from five consecutive patients with clinically high-risk PCa were obtained from radiologically suspicious and unsuspicious areas. All patients underwent mpMRI, MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsy, 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and a radical prostatectomy. CNAs were directly correlated to imaging features and radiogenomic analyses were performed. Highly significant CNAs (≥10 Mbp) were found in 22 of 46 biopsies. Chromosome 8p, 13q and 5q losses were the most common findings. There was an strong correspondence between the radiologic and the genomic index lesions. The radiogenomic analyses suggest the feasibility of developing radiologic signatures that can distinguish between genomically more or less aggressive lesions. In conclusion, imaging features of mpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT can guide to the genomically most aggressive lesion of a PCa.

Tristetraprolin is a key node of NF-κB activation and we investigated its biological and prognostic role in lethal prostate cancer.  Methods: In vitro assays assessed the function of tristetraprolin and the association between low mRNA tristetraprolin levels and lethal prostate cancer (metastatic disease or death) was assessed across independent prostatectomy cohorts: (i) nested case-control studies from Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians' Health Study, and (ii) prostatectomy samples from Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Tristetraprolin expression levels in prostatectomy samples from patients with localized disease and biopsies of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were assessed in a Cornell University cohort.  Results: In vitro tristetraprolin expression was inversely associated with NF-κB-controlled genes, proliferation, and enzalutamide sensitivity. Men with localized prostate cancer and lower quartile of tumor tristetraprolin expression had a significant, nearly two-fold higher risk of lethal prostate cancer after adjusting for known clinical and histologic prognostic features (age, RP Gleason score, T-stage). Tristetraprolin expression was also significantly lower in mCRPC compared with localized prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Lower levels of tristetraprolin in human prostate cancer prostatectomy tissue are associated with more aggressive prostate cancer and may serve as an actionable prognostic and predictive biomarker.

Overall relative risk of metastatic (M+) disease and prostate cancer (PCa) death was 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19-1.11) and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.17-1.36), respectively, in favor of screening. This ERSPC Rotterdam pilot 1 study cohort, screened in a period without noteworthy contamination, shows that PSA-based screening could result in considerable reductions of M+ disease and mortality which if confirmed in larger datasets should trigger further discussion on pros/cons of PCa screening. PATIENT SUMMARY: In a cohort with 19yr of follow-up, we found indications for a more substantial reduction in metastatic disease and cancer-specific mortality in favor of prostate cancer screening than previously reported. If confirmed in larger cohorts, these findings should be considered in the ongoing discussion on harms and benefits of prostate cancer screening.""","""['Daniël F Osses', 'Sebastiaan Remmers', 'Fritz H Schröder', 'Theo van der Kwast', 'Monique J Roobol']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate-specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening: reduction of prostate cancer mortality after correction for nonattendance and contamination in the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer: results of the Rotterdam section of the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer Incidence and Prostate-specific Antigen Testing: New Insights from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'The Patient Journey from Randomization to Detection of Prostate Cancer and Death: Results from ERSPC Rotterdam.', 'Prostate cancer screening-stepping forward with MRI.', 'Prostate cancer screening - is it time to change approach?', 'Abandon the Label of Clinically Insignificant Prostate Cancer.', 'Personalized strategies in population screening for prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of our study was to describe the preoperative anatomical features using magnetic resonance imaging in order to predict early continence recovery after robotic radical prostatectomy.  Material and methods:   72 patients who underwent robotic radical prostatectomy were prospectively analysed. EPIC questionnaire (1, 6 and 12 mo) and first self-reported continence were used to assess functional outcomes. Membranous urethral length (MUL) and MUL-prostate axis angle (aMULP) were assessed preoperatively on T2 weighted sagittal images.  Results:   Continence rate was 67.2%, 92.6% and 95.2% at 1, 6 and 12 months, respectively. Early continence was achieved in patients with the lower aMULP. At 1 month, average aMULP in continent patients was 107.21° (IC 95% 90.3-124.6) vs. 118.5° (IC 95% 117.7-134) in incontinent ones (P=.014). At 6 month differences in aMULP among groups were found: 114.24° (IC 95% 104.6-123.9) in continents vs. 142° (IC 95% 126.5-157.6) in incontinents (P=0.015). At 12 month, continent group showed a significantly higher preoperative aMULP. aMULP was revealed as the only independent predictor of urinary continence at 6 mo in multivariate analysis, OR 0.007 (IC 95% 0.002-0.012), P=0.012.

Hence, the quantification of these autofluorescent molecules could be hypothesized to be a potential marker for this type of tumour. In this case-control study, the autofluorescence of porphyrins in human faeces from patients with prostate cancer and control subjects was analysed using fluorescence spectroscopy.  Methods:   First, 3 mL of analytical-grade acetone was added to 0.3 g of faeces, and the mixture was macerated and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was analysed spectroscopically. The emission spectra from 550 to 750 nm were obtained by exciting the samples at 405 nm.  Results:   A significant difference between the samples from control and cancer subjects was established in the spectral region of 670-675 nm (p = 0.000127), which corresponds to a significant increase in faecal porphyrins in patients with cancer. There was no statistically significant correlation between PSA levels and faecal porphyrins.  Conclusion:   In this preliminary study conducted in humans, the results show a simple and non-invasive method to assess faecal porphyrins, which have the potential to function as a tumour biomarker in patients with prostate cancer. This approach has improved sensitivity and specificity over PSA testing.

Results:   We found that KD of EpCAM significantly inhibited tumour growth, increased xenograft sensitivity to chemotherapy/radiotherapy, and prolonged the survival of tumour-bearing mice. In addition, we demonstrated that KD of EpCAM is associated with downregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.

This problem is computationally much harder than the classical problem of identifying pairwise gene associations. Exhaustive search is infeasible for transcriptomic datasets also; since for [Formula: see text] genes, there are [Formula: see text] possible gene combinations. Our method builds three filters to avoid computing the association for a large fraction of the gene combinations, which do not produce high correlation.

The secondary aim was to determine the prognostic factors associated with positive choline PETCT findings in both detection of disseminated disease and in changes in the therapeutic indication.  Materials and methods:   Multicentre, retrospective, observational study of 269 patients diagnosed with PC. Mean age was 69 ± 9.2 years. Of the 269 patients, 62 (23%) had high-risk localized PC (group 1), 118 (43.9%) biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy (group 2), and 89 (33.1%) biochemical failure after radiotherapy (group 3). None of the patients showed clear evidence of distant disease on computed tomography or bone scans. The following potential prognostic factors were assessed: PSA level at diagnosis; primary and secondary Gleason; Gleason score (GS); clinical and pathologic T and N stage; number of positive cylinders in the biopsy; presence of vascular or lymphatic invasion; status of surgical margins; androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); time to biochemical recurrence; and PSA, PSA doubling time (PSADT), and PSA velocity (PSAV) at failure. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, and receiver-operating curves calculated.  Results:   The mean PSA by groups was, group 1: 31.22 ng/ml, group 2: 2.52 ng/ml and group 3: 5.85 ng/ml. The tumor detection rate with 18F-choline PETCT was 74% (group 1: 85.5%, group 2: 55.1% and group 3: 91%). Prognostic factors for positive 18F-choline PETCT were identified only in group 2: PSA at failure and PSADT. 18F-choline PETCT changed the therapeutic indication in 62.8% (group 1: 71%, group 2: 55.2% and group 3: 70.1%). The prognostic factors for a change in treatment were identified only in group 1: secondary Gleason ≤ 4 and GS ≤ 7 and in group 2: PSA at failure, PSA nadir after surgery and pathologic stage N0. 18F-choline PETCT identified lymph node and/or metastatic disease in 32.7% (group 1: 25.8%, group 2: 29.7% and group 3: 41.6%). Prognostic factors for detecting lymph node/metastasis were identified in the group 2: PSA failure ≥ 1.37 ng/ml and PSADT < 4 months and in the group 3: PSADT < 4.6 months and time to failure < 5 years.  Conclusion:   These findings support the clinical use de 18F-choline PET-CT in staging high-risk patients with a secondary Gleason ≤ 4 and GS ≤ 7, in restaging patients with biochemical recurrence after RP if PSA at failure ≥ 1.37 ng/ml or PSADT ≤ 4 months and in patients with biochemical failure after RT, if PSADT ≤ 4.6 months and time to failure < 5 years, because it determines a change in the therapeutic indication.""","""['P Samper Ots', 'A Luis Cardo', 'C Vallejo Ocaña', 'M A Cabeza Rodríguez', 'L A Glaria Enríquez', 'M L Couselo Paniagua', 'J Olivera Vegas']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Clinical utility of (18)F-fluorocholine positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in biochemical relapse of prostate cancer after radical treatment: results of a multicentre study.', 'Is there a role for ¹¹C-choline PET/CT in the early detection of metastatic disease in surgically treated prostate cancer patients with a mild PSA increase <1.5 ng/ml?', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The role of choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the management of patients with prostate-specific antigen progression after radical treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Imaging of Prostate Cancer Using 18F-Choline PET/Computed Tomography.']"""

Our aim was to evaluate the outcome of patients receiving radium 223 in a real-world setting.  Patients and methods:   We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis in the Triveneto region of Italy.  Results:   One hundred fifty-eight patients received radium 223 in our region. After a median follow-up of 9.5 months, 75 patients died. The median overall survival (OS) was 14.2 months, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.2 months. Seventy-one (45%) patients achieved progression as best response. Thirty-seven (23%) patients stopped the treatment early because of progression. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was prognostic for OS (18.4 vs. 12.3 vs. 7.5 months; 0 vs. 1, P = .0062; 0 vs. 2, P = .0002), whereas previous prostatectomy or docetaxel exposure were not. A neutrophil to lymphocytes ratio ≥ 3 significantly impacted OS (18.1 vs. 9.7 months; P < .001) and slightly impacted PFS (6.6 vs. 5.6 months; P = .05). Patients with a baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP) value ≥ 220 U/L had worse OS and PFS (24.1 vs. 10.5 months; 7.2 vs. 5.5 months; P < .001). Patients with changes in ALP value achieved better OS (P = .029) and PFS (P = .002). There was no difference according to the line of therapy (0 vs. ≥ 1; P = .490). The main grade 3/4 toxicities were anemia, asthenia, and thrombocytopenia.  Conclusion:   This large real-world report confirms comparable OS and PFS data when compared with the pivotal study, as well as the predictive role of ALP and neutrophil to lymphocytes ratio.

The aim of this study was to assess plan quality consistency of PAP prostate cancer patients in clinical practice.  Materials and methods:   100 prostate cancer patients were included from NKI and 129 from RadboudUMC (RUMC). Per institute a previously developed [1] treatment planning QA model, based on overlap volume histograms, was trained on PAP plans to predict achievable dose metrics which were then compared to the clinical PAP plans. A threshold of 3 Gy (DVH dose parameters)/3% (DVH volume parameters) was used to detect outliers. For the outlier plans, the PAP technique was adjusted with the aim of meeting the threshold.  Results:   The average difference between the prediction and the clinically achieved value was <0.5 Gy (mean dose parameters) and <1.2% (volume parameters), with standard deviation of 1.9 Gy/1.5% respectively. We found 8% (NKI)/25% (RUMC) of patients to exceed the 3 Gy/3% threshold, with deviations up to 6.7 Gy (mean dose rectum) and 6% (rectal wall V64Gy). In all cases the plans could be improved to fall within the thresholds, without compromising the other dose metrics.  Conclusion:   Independent treatment planning QA was used successfully to assess the quality of clinical PAP in a multi-institutional setting. Respectively 8% and 25% suboptimal clinical PAP plans were detected that all could be improved with replanning.

Synergistic therapy by targeting both bulk tumor cells and CSCs has shown promise in reversing chemoresistance and treating resistant prostate cancer. Herein, we demonstrated the fabrication of a pH and glutathione (GSH) sensitive nanocarrier for co-delivery of docetaxel (DTX) and rubone (RUB), a miR-34 activator for targeting CSCs, for the treatment of taxane resistant (TXR) prostate cancer. DTX loaded P-RUB (DTX/P-RUB) micelles were prepared by encapsulating DTX into pH responsive diisopropylaminoethanol (DIPAE) and GSH responsive RUB prodrug conjugated polycarbonate based micelles. The self-assembled DTX/P-RUB micelles displayed good stability in vitro and could efficiently target to tumors by enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. After endocytosis by tumor cells, the micelles underwent expansion and disassembly due to the protonation of DIPAE and GSH induced cleavage of disulfide bond in acidic endocytic vesicles, resulting in fast release of DTX and RUB. The released RUB then upregulated the intracellular miR-34a, which then affected the expression of proteins involved in chemoresistance, thus sensitizing the tumor cells towards DTX and further leading to significant inhibition of TXR tumor progression.

However, this has been largely based on female patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Objectives:   We tested whether this association also occurred in a novel cohort, men with prostate cancer undergoing radiotherapy. We investigated these associations throughout treatment (before and after side effects were medically predicted to occur), controlling known and novel variables.  Methods:   Homogenous male patients scheduled for radiotherapy (N = 35, mean age 71 years) completed baseline (pretreatment) measures; response expectancies of 18 treatment-related side effects; questions about baseline health and hormonal treatment, emotional state, and coping style. Response expectancies of the side effects were again measured two weeks into treatment. The severity of the same 18 toxicities was assessed two and seven weeks into treatment.  Results:   Hierarchical multiple linear regressions revealed baseline response expectancies significantly and independently predicted six of 18 toxicities two weeks into radiotherapy, contributing 12%-30% of explained variance (β = 0.39-0.59). Response expectancies assessed two weeks into treatment significantly and uniquely predicted seven of 17 experienced toxicities at seven weeks, explaining 17%-50% of variance (β = 0.49-0.91). Sexual toxicity response expectancies revealed the strongest associations with experience throughout treatment (β = 0.46-0.91), with ""inability to reach orgasm"" showing the largest effect.  Conclusion:   In this older male sample, response expectancies of side effects predicted experiences throughout treatment, including the period before toxicities were medically expected. Response expectancies of sexual side effects were robust, independent predictors of subsequent toxicities across treatment, especially issues with orgasm, warranting focus in practice and future research.""","""['Elise J Devlin', 'Hayley S Whitford', 'Linley A Denson', 'Andrew E Potter']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Pain Symptom Manage""","""[""'Measuring up': A comparison of two response expectancy assessment formats completed by men treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer."", 'The impact of valence framing on response expectancies of side effects and subsequent experiences: a randomised controlled trial.', 'Climacturia after definitive treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Cancer Treatment Side Effects: A Meta-analysis of the Relationship Between Response Expectancies and Experience.', 'Measuring self-reported sexual function in men with prostate cancer.', ""Men's perceptions and preferences regarding prostate cancer radiation therapy: A systematic scoping review."", 'Open- and Closed-Label Placebo and Nocebo Suggestions About a Sham Transdermal Patch.']"""

Focal laser thermal ablation (FLA) has the potential to control small tumors while preserving urinary and erectile function by leaving the neurovascular bundles and urethral sphincters intact. Accurate needle guidance is critical to the success of FLA. Multiparametric magnetic resonance images (mpMRI) can be used to identify targets, guide needles, and assess treatment outcomes. In this study, we evaluated the location of ablation zones relative to targeted lesions in 23 patients who underwent FLA therapy in a phase II trial. The ablation zone margins and unablated tumor volume were measured to determine whether complete coverage of each tumor was achieved, which would be considered a clinically successful ablation.  Methods:   Preoperative mpMRI was acquired for each patient 2-3 months preceding the procedure and the prostate and lesion(s) were manually contoured on 3 T T2-weighted axial images. The prostate and ablation zone(s) were also manually contoured on postablation 1.5 T T1-weighted contrast-enhanced axial images acquired immediately after the procedure intraoperatively. The lesion surface was nonrigidly registered to the postablation image using an initial affine registration followed by nonrigid thin-plate spline registration of the prostate surfaces. The margins between the registered lesion and ablation zone were calculated using a uniform spherical distribution of rays, and the volume of intersection was also calculated. Each prostate was contoured five times to determine the segmentation variability and its effect on intersection of the lesion and ablation zone.  Results:   Our study showed that the boundaries of the segmented tumor and ablation zone were close. Of the 23 lesions that were analyzed, 11 were completely covered by the ablation zone and 12 were partially covered. A shift of 1.0, 2.0, and 2.6 mm would result in 19, 21, and all tumors completely covered by the ablation zone, respectively. The median unablated tumor volume across all tumors was 0.1 mm 3 with an IQR of 3.7 mm 3 , which was 0.2% of the median tumor volume (46.5 mm 3 with an IQR of 46.3 mm 3 ). The median extension of the tumors beyond the ablation zone, in cases which were partially ablated, was 0.9 mm (IQR of 1.3 mm), with the furthest tumor extending 2.6 mm.  Conclusion:   In all cases, the boundary of the tumor was close to the boundary of the ablation zone, and in some cases, the boundary of the ablation zone did not completely enclose the tumor. Our results suggest that some of the ablations were not clinically successful and that there is a need for more accurate needle tracking and guidance methods.

Image patterns have been characterized by a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) algorithm and four GLCM parameters and linear depolarization ratio δL have been selected to compare calculated against measured data of prostate cells. Our results show that the irregular shapes of and heterogeneity in RI distributions for organelles play significant roles in the spatial distribution of scattered light by cells in comparison to the average RI values and their differences among the organelles.

Objective:   To examine real-world use and outcomes of olaparib treatment in Swedish patients during the first three years following regulatory approval.  Patients and methods:   This is a population-based cohort study using data from the Swedish national registers. All individuals initiating olaparib treatment from regulatory approval to 31 December 2017 were included. The extent of off-label use was assessed based on recorded diagnoses. Ovarian cancer patients were followed until death or the end of the study period. Starting dose and dose adjustments were assessed. Time to olaparib discontinuation and overall survival were plotted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves.  Results:   We identified 109 patients to whom olaparib was dispensed in Sweden during the study period. Nine of these were prescribed olaparib off-label for either breast or prostate cancer and were excluded from further analyses. Median age among the remaining 100 patients with ovarian cancer was 59 years (range: 42-83). Almost all patients (96%) started on the recommended dose (400 mg [eight capsules] taken twice daily). Dose reductions were explicitly recorded for 14% of patients. Median time to discontinuation was 289 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 226; 338). Median overall survival from olaparib initiation was 1002 days (95% CI: 676; not calculable).  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study of olaparib real-world use and outcomes. During the first three years following regulatory approval, olaparib was mainly prescribed to ovarian cancer patients.

Here we show that the ubiquitin-proteasome-system (UPS) is suppressed in enzalutamide/abiraterone resistant prostate cancer. AR/AR-V7 proteostasis requires the interaction of E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1 and HSP70 complex. STUB1 disassociates AR/AR-V7 from HSP70, leading to AR/AR-V7 ubiquitination and degradation. Inhibition of HSP70 significantly inhibits prostate tumor growth and improves enzalutamide/abiraterone treatments through AR/AR-V7 suppression. Clinically, HSP70 expression is upregulated and correlated with AR/AR-V7 levels in high Gleason score prostate tumors.

AKT primarily regulates acetyl-CoA production and phosphorylates many histone-modulating enzymes, resulting in their activation or inhibition. Therefore, understanding the therapeutic impact of AKT inhibition on chromatin-related events is essential. Here, we report that AKT inhibition in prostate-specific PTEN knockout mice significantly induces di- and trimethylation of H3K4 with concomitant reduction in H3K9 acetylation. Mechanistically, we observed that AKT inhibition reduces expression of the H3K4 methylation-specific histone demethylases KDM5 family, especially KDM5B expression at transcriptional levels. Furthermore, we observed that AKT negatively regulates miR-137 levels, which transcriptionally represses KDM5B expression. Overexpression of miR-137 significantly reduced KDM5B and increased H3K4 methylation levels but failed to change AKT phosphorylation. Overall, we observed that AKT transcriptionally regulates KDM5B mainly via repression of miR-137. Our data identify a mechanism by which AKT kinase modulates the prostate cancer epigenome through regulating H3K4 methylation.

We investigated the patterns of radical prostatectomy (RP) for pathologic insignificant (iCaP) and significant CaP (sCaP) as well as variations between academic and nonacademic hospitals.  Patients and methods:   Patients undergoing RP for clinical T1c CaP were identified in the National Cancer Database between 2006 and 2013. The primary outcome was the trend of RP for insignificant prostate cancer (iCaP) and significant prostate cancer (sCaP) over the study period. The secondary outcome was to compare the RP rate in academic vs. nonacademic institutions. Univariable and multivariable analysis were utilized to evaluate the association between overtreatment and practice type. iCaP was defined as organ confined CaP with Gleason Score ≤6.  Results:   The total number of RP increased from 17,970 cases in 2006 to 25,324 in 2013. The RP rate decreased for iCaP from 39.9% to 19.8%, while increasing for sCaP from 18% to 27% over the study period. Patients undergoing RP in academic settings were less likely to have iCaP (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.80-0.97). Caucasian race, private insurance, younger age, and treatment in the Eastern United States were associated with higher rates of iCaP at RP.  Conclusion:   The rate of iCaP has declined over time in the United States for patients undergoing RP. Although RP in nonacademic setting was more likely to have iCaP on surgical pathology, this trend has been downward among practice types. Treatment appropriateness is an underrecognized, undermeasured, but increasingly important component of the high-value care discussion that warrants greater attention.""","""['Aydin Pooli', 'Amirali Salmasi', 'Izak Faiena', 'Andrew T Lenis', 'David C Johnson', 'Cedric Lebacle', 'Alexandra Drakaki', 'Kiran Gollapudi', 'Jeremy Blumberg', 'Allan J Pantuck', 'Karim Chamie']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Radical prostatectomy then and now: Surgical overtreatment of prostate cancer is declining from 2009 to 2016 at a tertiary referral center.', 'Positive surgical margins at radical prostatectomy in the United States: Institutional variations and predictive factors.', 'Contemporary management of men with high-risk localized prostate cancer in the United States.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Contrasting the academic and nonacademic hepatology practice settings.', 'Radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer | Opinion: NO.']"""

Material and methods:   We have a prospective clinical study since 2004 that has followed 138 men with locally advanced prostate cancer (T1-T4N0-N1M0) treated with definitive RT encompassing the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes and long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Forty nine of the 52 patients that developed recurrence were imaged at biochemical failure to detect the site of recurrence.  Results:   Imaging identified the site of recurrence in 46 patients. Twenty five patients had prostatic recurrence only, none had local lymph node recurrence only, 11 had distant metastases only, 7 had prostatic recurrence and distant metastases, 2 had prostatic recurrence, local nodal recurrence and distant metastases, and 1 had local nodal recurrence with distant metastases. The mean time to recurrence was 62 months for prostate only, 40 months for distant only and 50 months for prostate and distant recurrence. There was a 69% recurrence rate for patients with magnetic resonance imaging -detected N1 disease. There was significantly longer survival for patients with prostate recurrence only compared to patients with distant recurrence (P < 0.018). Five-year prostate cancer-specific survival were 85% for prostate only, 44% for distant only and 48% for prostate and distant recurrence (prostate only vs. distant only; P = 0.008, prostate only vs. prostate and distant; P = 0.018, distant vs. prostate and distant; P = 0.836).  Conclusions:   The predominant recurrence pattern for high-risk, N1 prostate cancer was prostatic recurrence and distant spread after pelvic RT and androgen deprivation therapy. Our data argue for further local dose escalation and pelvic nodal radiation to prevent recurrence in these sites. Lymph node metastasis at initial staging with an magnetic resonance imaging was a strong predictor of recurrence and poor survival and may identify patients in need of more aggressive treatment.""","""['Jonathan Hayman', 'Knut H Hole', 'Therese Seierstad', 'Jamie Perin', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Phuoc T Tran', 'Wolfgang Lilleby']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Favorable outcomes in locally advanced and node positive prostate cancer patients treated with combined pelvic IMRT and androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Nodal Clearance Rate and Long-Term Efficacy of\xa0Individualized Sentinel Node-Based Pelvic Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation therapy in intermediate risk prostate cancer?', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Radiotherapy in nodal oligorecurrent prostate cancer.', 'Ablative Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer: Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy and High Dose Rate Brachytherapy.', 'Simultaneous Metabolic and Perfusion Imaging Using Hyperpolarized 13C MRI Can Evaluate Early and Dose-Dependent Response to Radiation Therapy in a Prostate Cancer Mouse Model.']"""

Patients and methods:   We studied 204 patients who underwent RALP between May 2013 and March 2016. All patients underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) preoperatively to measure MUL. Urinary continence was defined as the use of one pad or less (safety pad).

We retrospectively analyzed the patients in terms of preoperative clinical factors including age, body mass index (BMI), estimated prostate volume, neurovascular bundle salvage, history of preoperative hormonal therapy, and MUL.  Results:   The safety pad use rate was 69.6%, 86.9%, and 91.1% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. On univariate and multivariate analyses, MUL were significant factors in every term of recovery of urinary continence in both groups.

As PET isotopes generate a continuous spectrum of light in the ultraviolet/visible (UV/vis) wavelength range (Cerenkov luminescence, CL) in dielectric materials and consequently inside living tissues, these isotopes can also be detected by luminescence imaging performed with optical imaging (OI) systems. Imaging tumors with tracers that are specifically binding to a tumor-associated antigen can increase diagnostic accuracy, enables monitoring of treatment efficacy, and can be advantageous compared to radiolabeled small molecules used in PET-oncology such as 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG; glucose metabolism) or [11C]choline (membrane synthesis) which was used to image prostate cancer. In this study, we compared on three consecutive days immuno-CLI and -PET of the applied 64Cu-labeled and well described monoclonal antibody 3/F11 in prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive (C4-2, PSMA+) and -negative (DU 145, PSMA-) prostate tumor xenografts, inoculated in SCID mice. In vivo immuno-CLI and -PET measurements demonstrated linear correlation of both modalities, in line with ex vivo analysis performed with CLI and γ-counting.

This study compares 2 prospective phase 2 trials using SABR in high-risk PCa, with and without ENI.  Methods and materials:   Patients had high-risk PCa. Those in trial 1 received 40 Gy in 5 fractions to the prostate and 30 Gy in 5 fractions to the seminal vesicles. Patients in trial 2 received 40 Gy in 5 fractions to the prostate and 25 Gy in 5 fractions to the pelvis and seminal vesicles. National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicities were collected. Biochemical failure (BF) was defined as nadir + 2, and the 4-year prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (4yPSARR) was <0.4 ng/mL.  Results:   Sixty patients were included (trial 1, n = 30; trial 2, n = 30). Median follow-up was 5.6 years and 4.0 years. The median nadir PSA was 0.02 ng/mL for both trials. Six patients had BF, all from trial 1. The BF rate was 14.6% at 5 years in trial 1 and 0% in trial 2. Sixty-three percent of patients in trial 1 and 93% in trial 2 had a 4yPSARR. Two patients died in trial 1, 1 from metastatic disease. One patient in trial 2 died of other causes. No other patients developed metastatic disease, and 1 patient in trial 1 had castrate resistant PCa. Overall survival at 5 years was 93.2% and 96.7% (P = .86). There was significantly worse late gastrointestinal and sexual toxicity in trial 1, but there was no difference in late genitourinary toxicity.  Conclusions:   SABR in high-risk PCa yields biochemical control rates that may be comparable to that of other radiation therapy modalities. ENI using SABR is feasible and may lead to a significant improvement in biochemical control and in 4yPSARR, without an increase in late gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity.

Participants were recruited from respondents to the life after prostate cancer diagnosis (LAPCD) national survey. Men were 3 to 5 years postdiagnosis, and following a range of treatment pathways. Data were analysed using the Framework Approach.  Results:   Younger couples affected by PCa felt challenged by issues relating to their parental role and the dynamics within the family. Five main themes emerged: difficult conversations about PCa diagnosis; parental perceptions of the impact of diagnosis on children; parental responses to the impact of PCa on the family; shielding, coping, and normalising strategies; and levels of support.  Conclusions:   A diagnosis of PCa can cause significant disruption to the family unit and the quality of life of its members. Support programmes offering guidance to children/young adults affected by PCa in their family, and addressing the concerns of parents may help families to better adapt. Encouraging clinical professionals to initiate conversations with younger couples about their children may be a way forward in directing appropriate support. Further research is needed to elucidate appropriate, effective supportive interventions.""","""['Nicole Collaço', 'Richard Wagland', 'Obrey Alexis', 'Anna Gavin', 'Adam Glaser', 'Eila K Watson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['The experiences and needs of couples affected by prostate cancer aged 65 and under: a qualitative study.', 'Heterosexual couples and prostate cancer support groups: a gender relations analysis.', ""Improving couples' quality of life through a Web-based prostate cancer education intervention."", 'Prostate cancer and the impact on couples: a qualitative metasynthesis.', 'The experiences of family members in the year following the diagnosis of a child or adolescent with cancer: a qualitative systematic review.', 'Active Engagement, Protective Buffering, and Depressive Symptoms in Young-Midlife Couples Surviving Cancer: The Roles of Age and Sex.', 'Using the Framework Method for the Analysis of Qualitative Dyadic Data in Health Research.', 'The experiences and needs of couples affected by prostate cancer aged 65 and under: a qualitative study.']"""

Medical ADT is associated with better long-term quality of life due to the flexibility of possible therapy interruption but comes with a higher cumulative cost. In the current study, the authors examined whether surgical ADT (ie, bilateral orchiectomy) was used differentially by race/ethnicity and other social factors.  Methods:   The authors identified patients with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis through the California Cancer Registry. The association between race/ethnicity and receipt of surgical ADT was modeled using multivariable Firth logistic regression adjusting for age, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, clinical tumor and lymph node classification, neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), insurance, marital status, comorbidities, initial treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy), location of care, rural/urban area of residence, and year of diagnosis.  Results:   The authors examined a total of 10,675 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, 11.4% of whom were non-Hispanic black, 8.4% of whom were Asian/Pacific Islander, 18.5% of whom were Hispanic/Latino, and 60.5% of whom were non-Hispanic white. In the multivariable model, patients found to be more likely to receive surgical ADT were Hispanic/Latino (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.72), were from a low neighborhood SES (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.34-2.89) or rural area (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.15-1.92), and had Medicaid/public insurance (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.58-3.10). Patients with military/Veterans Affairs insurance were significantly less likely to receive surgical ADT compared with patients with private insurance (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13-0.88).  Conclusions:   Race/ethnicity, neighborhood SES, and insurance status appear to be significantly associated with receipt of surgical ADT. Future research will need to characterize other differences in initial treatments among men with advanced prostate cancer based on race/ethnicity and aim to better understand what factors drive the association between surgical ADT among men of Hispanic origin or those from areas with low neighborhood SES.""","""['Hala T Borno', 'Daphne Y Lichtensztajn', 'Scarlett L Gomez', 'Nynikka R Palmer', 'Charles J Ryan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Racial, Socioeconomic, and Geographic Disparities in the Receipt, Timing to Initiation, and Duration of Adjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Impact of ethnicity on the outcome of men with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Trends and racial differences in the use of androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Contemporary role of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Financial toxicity differences between chemical versus surgical androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Significant financial differences of chemical and surgical androgen deprivation in a contemporary cohort.', 'Relationship between Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Normal-Tension Glaucoma in Patients with Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Cohort Study.', 'Concurrent Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer Improves Survival for Synchronous or Metachronous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A SEER-Medicare Database Analysis.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy may reduce the risk of primary open-angle glaucoma in patients with prostate cancer: a nationwide population-based cohort study.']"""

Copper diethyldithiocarbamate (Cu(DDC)2) complex formed by DSF and copper ions is a major active ingredient for its anticancer activity. Direct administration of Cu(DDC)2 is a promising strategy to enhance the anticancer efficacy of DSF. However, efficient drug delivery remains a significant challenge for Cu(DDC)2 and hinders its clinical use. In this study, we developed a facile stabilized metal ion ligand complex (SMILE) method to prepare Cu(DDC)2 nanoparticles (NPs). The SMILE method could prepare Cu(DDC)2 NPs with different types of stabilizers including 1,2-distearoyl- sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 2000, d-α-tocopherol PEG 1000 succinate, methoxy PEG 5000- b-poly(l-lactide) 5000, and other generally recognized as safe excipients approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The optimized formulations demonstrated excellent drug-loading efficiency (close to 100%), high drug concentrations (increased drug concentration by over 200-fold compared to the traditional micelle formulation), and an optimal particle size in the sub-100 nm range. Cu(DDC)2 NPs exhibited outstanding stability in serum for 72 h and can also be stored at room temperature for at least 1 month. The anticancer effects of Cu(DDC)2 NP formulations were determined by multiple assays including 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, colony-forming assay, calcein-AM/propidium iodide staining, and others. Cu(DDC)2 NPs showed excellent activity against drug-resistant prostate cancer cells and other cancer cells with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of around 100 nM. Our study also demonstrated that Cu(DDC)2 NPs induced cell death in drug-resistant prostate cancer cells (DU145-TXR) through paraptosis, which is a nonapoptotic cell death. To our best knowledge, the SMILE method provides, for the first time, a simple yet efficient process for generating Cu(DDC)2 NPs with high drug concentration, excellent loading efficiency, and desirable physicochemical properties. This method could potentially address drug delivery challenges of DSF/copper-based chemotherapy and facilitate its clinical translation.""","""['Wu Chen', 'Wen Yang', 'Pengyu Chen', 'Yongzhuo Huang', 'Feng Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Development and optimization of an injectable formulation of copper diethyldithiocarbamate, an active anticancer agent.', 'Highly Stable, Coordinated Polymeric Nanoparticles Loading Copper(II) Diethyldithiocarbamate for Combinational Chemo/Chemodynamic Therapy of Cancer.', 'Biomimetic metal-organic nanoparticles prepared with a 3D-printed microfluidic device as a novel formulation for disulfiram-based therapy against breast cancer.', 'Old wine in new bottles: Advanced drug delivery systems for disulfiram-based cancer therapy.', 'Recent Advances in Repurposing Disulfiram and Disulfiram Derivatives as Copper-Dependent Anticancer Agents.', 'Paraptosis: a unique cell death mode for targeting cancer.', 'Targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling using XAV939 nanoparticles in tumor microenvironment-conditioned macrophages promote immunogenicity.', 'In vitro and in vivo evaluation of diethyldithiocarbamate with copper ions and its liposomal formulation for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.', 'Potential of Copper and Copper Compounds for Anticancer Applications.', 'Mechanosensitive channel MscL induces non-apoptotic cell death and its suppression of tumor growth by ultrasound.']"""

Thus, novel approaches for identification of CRPC are important for designing effective PCa treatments. Analysis of microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures by RNA sequencing showed that both passenger and guide strands of the miR-455-duplex (miR-455-5p and miR-455-3p, respectively) acted as antitumor miRNAs in PCa cells. The involvement of miRNA passenger strands in cancer pathogenesis is a novel concept for miRNA functionality. Based on a large patient cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas, expression of eight miR-455-5p/-3p target genes (PIR: P = 0.0137, LRP8: P = 0.0495, IGFBP3: P = 0.0172, DMBX1: P = 0.0175, CCDC64: P = 0.0446, TUBB1: P = 0.0149, KIF21B: P = 0.0336, and NFAM1: P = 0.0013) was significantly associated with poor prognosis of PCa patients. Here, we focused on PIR (pirin), a highly conserved member of the cupin superfamily. PIR expression was directly regulated by miR-455-5p, and PIR overexpression was detected in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) surgical specimens and CRPC autopsy specimens. Loss-of-function assays using siRNA or an inhibitor (bisamide) showed that downregulation of PIR expression blocked cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, the miR-455-5p/PIR axis contributed to cancer cell aggressiveness. These results suggest that PIR might be a promising diagnostic marker for HSPC and CRPC. Furthermore, CRPC treatment strategies targeting PIR may be possible in the future. Identification of antitumor miRNAs, including miRNA passenger strands, may contribute to the development of new diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies for CRPC.""","""['Takayuki Arai', 'Satoko Kojima', 'Yasutaka Yamada', 'Sho Sugawara', 'Mayuko Kato', 'Kazuto Yamazaki', 'Yukio Naya', 'Tomohiko Ichikawa', 'Naohiko Seki']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Regulation of NCAPG by miR-99a-3p (passenger strand) inhibits cancer cell aggressiveness and is involved in CRPC.', 'Impact of novel miR-145-3p regulatory networks on survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Micro-ribonucleic acid expression signature of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Regulation of NCAPH by antitumor miR-199a/b-3p.', 'Microdissecting the role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.', 'The role of microRNA in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Pirin is a prognostic marker of human melanoma that dampens the proliferation of malignant cells by downregulating JARID1B/KDM5B expression.', 'Identification of KIF21B as a Biomarker for Colorectal Cancer and Associated with Poor Prognosis.', 'Role of motor proteins in human cancers.', 'Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 8 at the Crossroad between Cancer and Neurodegeneration.', 'Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 facilitates the proliferation and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer cells by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.']"""

Avelumab selectively binds to PDL1, and competitively blocks its interaction with anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies. Unlike anti-PD-1 antibodies, which target T-cells, avelumab targets tumor cells, and is therefore expected to have fewer side effects, including a lower risk of Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs). Uncertainties remain regarding a potential synergy resulting in increased toxicities by combining radiotherapy and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).

Methods:   One hundred ninety-three patients were trained via a biofeedback mechanism to maintain a partially filled bladder with a reproducible volume of 200-300 cc at planning CT and subsequently at each fraction of radiotherapy. We prospectively analyzed whether and to what extent the patients' ability to maintain a certain bladder filling influenced the degree of acute GU toxicity and whether cut-off values could be differentiated.  Results:   We demonstrated that the ability to reach a reproducible bladder volume above a threshold volume of 180 cc and maintain that volume via biofeedback throughout treatment predicts for a decrease in acute GU toxicity during curative high-dose IMRT of the prostate. Patients who were not able to reach a partial bladder filling to that cut-off value and were not able to maintain a partially filled bladder throughout treatment had a significantly higher risk of developing ≥grade 2 GU acute toxicity.

This study was done to assess the ability of 18F-fluoromethylcholine (18F-FCH) PET/CT (hereafter referred to as 18F-FCH), 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA-11 PET/CT (hereafter referred to as PSMA), and pelvic multiparametric MRI (hereafter referred to as pelvic MRI) to identify men who will best benefit from SRT. Methods: Prospective, multisite imaging studies were carried out in men who had rising PSA levels after RP, high-risk features, and negative/equivocal conventional imaging results and who were being considered for SRT. 18F-FCH (91/91), pelvic MRI (88/91), and PSMA (31/91) (Australia) were all performed within 2 wk. Imaging was interpreted by experienced local/central interpreters who were masked with regard to other imaging results, with consensus being reached for discordant interpretations. Expected management was documented before and after imaging, and data about all treatments and PSA levels were collected for 3 y. The treatment response to SRT was defined as a reduction in PSA levels of >50% without androgen deprivation therapy. Results: The median Gleason score, PSA level at imaging, and PSA doubling time were 8, 0.42 (interquartile range, 0.29-0.93) ng/mL, and 5.0 (interquartile range, 3.3-7.6) months. Recurrent prostate cancer was detected in 28% (25/88) by pelvic MRI, 32% (29/91) by 18F-FCH, and 42% (13/31) by PSMA. This recurrence was found within the PF in 21.5% (19/88), 13% (12/91), and 19% (6/31) and at sites outside the PF (extra-PF) in 8% (7/88), 19% (17/91), and 32% (10/31) by MRI, 18F-FCH, and PSMA, respectively (P < 0.004). A total of 94% (16/17) of extra-PF sites on 18F-FCH were within the pelvic MRI field. Intrapelvic extra-PF disease was detected in 90% (9/10) by PSMA and in 31% (5/16) by MRI. 18F-FCH changed management in 46% (42/91), and MRI changed management in 24% (21/88). PSMA provided additional management changes over 18F-FCH in 23% (7/31). The treatment response to SRT was higher in men with negative results or disease confined to the PF than in men with extra-PF disease (18F-FCH 73% [32/44] versus 33% [3/9] [P < 0.02], pelvic MRI 70% [32/46] versus 50% [2/4] [P was not significant], and PSMA 88% [7/8] versus 14% [1/7] [P < 0.005]).

However, the application of these guidelines may vary among ethnic groups. We compared receipt of guideline-concordant treatment between Latino and non-Latino white men in California. Methods: California Cancer Registry data were used to identify 2,421 Latino and 8,636 non-Latino white men diagnosed with high-risk localized PCa from 2010 through 2014. The association of clinical and sociodemographic factors with definitive treatment was examined using logistic regression, overall and by ethnicity. Results: Latinos were less likely than non-Latino whites to receive definitive treatment before (odds ratio [OR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.71-0.88) and after adjusting for age and tumor characteristics (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.95). Additional adjustment for sociodemographic factors eliminated the disparity. However, the association with treatment differed by ethnicity for several factors. Latino men with no health insurance were considerably less likely to receive definitive treatment relative to insured Latino men (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23-0.49), an association that was more pronounced than among non-Latino whites (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.83). Intermediate-versus high-grade disease was associated with lower odds of definitive treatment in Latinos (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59-0.97) but not non-Latino whites. Younger age and care at NCI-designated Cancer Centers were significantly associated with receipt of definitive treatment in non-Latino whites but not in Latinos. Conclusions: California Latino men diagnosed with localized high-risk PCa are at increased risk for undertreatment. The observed treatment disparity is largely explained by sociodemographic factors, suggesting it may be ameliorated through targeted outreach, such as that aimed at younger and underinsured Latino men.""","""['Daphne Y Lichtensztajn', 'John T Leppert', 'James D Brooks', 'Sumit A Shah', 'Weiva Sieh', 'Benjamin I Chung', 'Scarlett L Gomez', 'Iona Cheng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['Racial treatment trends in localized/regional prostate carcinoma: 1992-1999.', 'Differential use of medical versus surgical androgen deprivation therapy for patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Getting back to equal: The influence of insurance status on racial disparities in the treatment of African American men with high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Association of Sociodemographic and Health-Related Factors With Receipt of Nondefinitive Therapy Among Younger Men With High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Racial/ethnic differences in receipt of pelvic lymph node dissection among men with localized/regional prostate cancer.', 'Accuracy of prostate cancer screening recommendations for high-risk populations on YouTube and TikTok.', 'Long-term follow-up of a racially and ethnically diverse population of men with localized prostate cancer who did not undergo initial active treatment.', 'Molecular Changes in Tissue Proteome during Prostate Cancer Development: Proof-of-Principle Investigation.']"""

Material and methods:   We prospectively analysed 64 patients with biochemical relapse (median PSA: 4.25 ng/mL). A PET/CT was performed with 11C-choline, and another with 68Ga-DOTATATE. The SUVmax was measured in all lesions. The correlative images, histopathology and/or clinical and biochemical follow-up were taken as the reference standard.  Results:   The overall detection rate per patient was 48.43% for 68Ga-DOTATATE and 46.87% for 11C-choline. The results were concordant in 53 cases (82.81%). The maximum SUV of 11C-choline was significantly higher than that of 68Ga-DOTATATE for all the concordant lesions (n=130): 6.17 (1.7-15.5) versus 4.38 (1.37-26.7), median (range) for each radiotracer, respectively (p < .0001). The sensitivity and specificity values per patient were the same for both techniques: 0.82 (0.65-0.93) and 0.9 (0.73-0.98), respectively. Although the difference was not significant, the sensitivity was lower in patients with lower PSA levels: 0.63 vs. 0.89; p=.13.

In the last years, new data have emerged implicating TLX in prostate and breast cancer. Therefore, inhibitors of TLX transcriptional activity may have a significant impact on the treatment of several critical malignancies. However, the TLX protein possesses a non-canonical ligand-binding domain (LBD), which lacks a ligand-binding pocket (conventionally targeted in case of nuclear receptors) that complicates the development of small molecule inhibitors of TLX. Herein, we utilized a rational structure-based design approach to identify small molecules targeting the Atro-box binding site of human TLX LBD. As a result of virtual screening of ~7 million molecular structures, 97 compounds were identified and evaluated in the TLX-responsive luciferase reporter assay. Among those, three chemicals demonstrated 40⁻50% inhibition of luciferase-detected transcriptional activity of the TLX orphan nuclear receptor at a dose of 35 µM.

Physicians work with patients to make difficult treatment decisions. They are often aided by a multitude of prognostic models to assess risk and predict outcomes. These survival analysis models may analyze features characterizing biomolecular and histomorphic properties of the solid tumor sample. Commonly, multiple samples per patient are analyzed and features are combined in some way to generate a single result, such as by taking the median measurement. Recently, support vector regression approaches paired with a semi-supervised transduction framework have proven powerful in building such prognostic models. Separately, there has been work presenting the use of interval kernels to capture the range of measurements across multiple samples as an ""interval"" via the Hausdorff distance within a kernel based support vector approach. This paper presents the first results in exploring a combination of these two concepts. Namely, using an interval kernel based support vector approach within the aforementioned transduction framework to build prognostic models leveraging information from multiple tumor samples per patient. The results show that interval kernels yield more accurate prognostic models, and the semi-supervised transduction framework further improves performance. This suggests that this novel combination of unique recent advances can help build better prognostic models and improve the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Faisal M Khan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Predicting Advanced Prostate Cancer from Modeling Early Indications in Biopsy and Prostatectomy Samples via Transductive Semi-Supervised Survival Analysis.', 'Impact of prostate biopsy tumor amount on imaging based prognostics employing transductive semi-supervised regression.', 'SVM-RFE: selection and visualization of the most relevant features through non-linear kernels.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Virtual screening with support vector machines and structure kernels.']"""

Records of 2057 patients who underwent RP at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (Seongnam, Korea) between 2006 and 2015 were reviewed; patients were divided according to age into the younger and older groups (men aged ≤50 and >50 years, respectively). Postoperative BCR status and functional outcomes and clinicopathologic features were compared between both groups. All analyses were repeated after propensity score matching. Younger men were more likely to have low-risk disease (P < 0.001), lower pathologic Gleason score (P < 0.001) and pathologic stages (P < 0.001) than older men. The pathologic Gleason score (P = 0.002) and rates of extracapsular extension (P = 0.004) were lower in younger men after propensity score matching. In multivariate analysis, age at RP was not an independent predictor of BCR-free survival after RP (P = 0.669). Moreover, at 1 year after RP, younger men with preoperative 5-item International Index of Erectile Function score ≥22 (n = 228) showed more favorable results for urinary continence (defined as nonuse of pads daily) (99.4% vs 95%, P = 0.009) and erections sufficient for vaginal intercourse (81.8% vs 55.5%, P = 0.001).

The definitive radiographic diagnosis of this clinical entity is not described. In this study, we characterize the plain film and magnetic resonance imaging findings of pubic osteomyelitis.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed a database of prostate cancer survivors with diagnosed pubic osteomyelitis from 2011 to 2015. These patients underwent pelvic plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging with T1-weighted and fat-suppressed T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences. Intravenous gadolinium was utilized. The diagnosis was verified with extirpative surgery. 16 patients with diagnosed pubic osteomyelitis from 2011 to 2015 underwent imaging at our institution.  Results:   All patients demonstrated increased signal on T2- weighted sequences and decreased signal on T1-weighted sequences along the pubic symphysis and the marrow of the involved pubic rami. Inflammatory myositis with diastasis of the pubic symphysis and cortical bone erosion were identified in the majority of patients. Fluid collections were identified in 75% of patients. 63% of conventional radiographs demonstrated no radiographic evidence of pubic osteomyelitis.  Conclusion:   Magnetic resonance imaging of pubic symphysis osteomyelitis in the prostate cancer survivor is characterized by high signal on T2-weighted images and low signal on T1-weighted images of the involved pubic rami, with the majority of patients demonstrating regional myositis. Imaging data combined with clinical assessment should prompt diagnosis and management of pubic osteomyelitis. Conventional radiography is generally insensitive to these findings.

A unique approach to target and kill colon, prostate, and other epithelial-type cancer cells in the blood has been recently developed that uses circulating leukocytes to present the cancer-specific, liposome-bound Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) on their surface along with E - selectin adhesion receptors. This approach, demonstrated both in vitro with human blood and in mice, mimics the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells. The resulting liposomal TRAIL-coated leukocytes hold promise as an effective means to neutralize circulating tumor cells that enter the bloodstream with the potential to form new metastases. Methods: The computational biology study reported here examines the mechanism of this effective signal delivery, by considering the kinetics of the coupled reaction cascade, from TRAIL binding death receptor to eventual apoptosis. In this study, a collision of bound TRAIL with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is considered and compared to a prolonged exposure of CTCs to soluble TRAIL. An existing computational model of soluble TRAIL treatment was modified to represent the kinetics from a diffusion-limited 3D reference frame into a 2D collision frame with advection and adhesion to mimic the E - selectin and membrane bound TRAIL treatment. Thus, the current model recreates the new approach of targeting cancer cells within the blood. The model was found to faithfully reproduce representative observations from experiments of liposomal TRAIL treatment under shear. Results: The model predicts apoptosis of CTCs within 2 h when treated with membrane bound TRAIL, while apoptosis in CTCs treated with soluble TRAIL proceeds much more slowly over the course of 10 h, consistent with previous experiments. Given the clearance rate of soluble TRAIL in vivo, this model predicts that the soluble TRAIL method would be rendered ineffective, as found in previous experiments. Conclusion: This study therefore indicates that the kinetics of the coupled reaction cascade of liposomal E - selectin and membrane bound TRAIL colliding with CTCs can explain why this new approach to target and kill cancer cells in blood is much more effective than its soluble counterpart.""","""['Emily E Lederman', 'Jacob M Hope', 'Michael R King']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['TRAIL-coated leukocytes that kill cancer cells in the circulation.', 'Unnatural killer cells to prevent bloodborne metastasis: inspiration from biology and engineering.', 'Delivery of apoptotic signal to rolling cancer cells: a novel biomimetic technique using immobilized TRAIL and E-selectin.', 'TRAIL-NP hybrids for cancer therapy: a review.', 'TRAIL/Apo-2L: mechanisms and clinical applications in cancer.', 'Epigenetic investigation into circulating microRNA 197-3p in sera from patients affected by malignant pleural mesothelioma and workers ex-exposed to asbestos.', 'TRAIL receptor-induced features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition increase tumour phenotypic heterogeneity: potential cell survival mechanisms.', 'Activation of Piezo1 sensitizes cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis through mitochondrial outer membrane permeability.']"""

However, the precise enzymatic source of ROS generation, the subcellular localization of ROS production and cellular targets in vivo that influence tumour-promoting processes, are largely undefined. Here, using mRNA microarrays, we show increased gene expression for NOX2, the catalytic subunit of the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase enzyme, in human primary prostate cancer compared to non-malignant tissue. In addition, NOX4 gene expression was markedly elevated in human metastatic prostate cancers, but not in primary prostate tumours. Using a syngeneic, orthotopic mouse model of prostate cancer the genetic deletion of NOX2 (i.e. NOX2 -/y mouse) resulted in reduced angiogenesis and an almost complete failure in tumour development. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of NOX2 oxidase suppressed established prostate tumours in mice. In isolated endothelial cells, and in human normal and prostate cancer cells, NOX2 co-located to varying degrees with early endosome markers including EEA1, Appl1 and Rab5A and the late endosome marker Rab7A, and this correlated with significant VEGF-A-dependent ROS production within acidified endosomal compartments and endothelial cell proliferation that was NOX2 oxidase- and hydrogen peroxide dependent. We concluded that NOX2 oxidase expression and endosomal ROS production were important for prostate cancer growth and that this was required to positively regulate the VEGF pathway. The research provides a paradigm for limiting tumour growth through a better understanding of NOX2 oxidase's effect on VEGF signalling and how controlling the development of tumour vasculature can limit prostate tumour development and metastasis.""","""['Ian P Harrison', 'Antony Vinh', 'Ian R D Johnson', 'Raymond Luong', 'Grant R Drummond', 'Christopher G Sobey', 'Tony Tiganis', 'Elizabeth D Williams', ""John J O' Leary"", 'Doug A Brooks', 'Stavros Selemidis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['NOX2, NOX4, and mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species contribute to angiopoietin-1 signaling and angiogenic responses in endothelial cells.', 'Novel endosomal NOX2 oxidase inhibitor ameliorates pandemic influenza A virus-induced lung inflammation in mice.', 'VEGF signaling through NADPH oxidase-derived ROS.', 'Redox signaling in angiogenesis: role of NADPH oxidase.', 'Localizing NADPH oxidase-derived ROS.', 'Development of Novel High-Affinity Antagonists for the Relaxin Family Peptide Receptor 1.', 'Genomic Interplay between Neoneurogenesis and Neoangiogenesis in Carcinogenesis: Therapeutic Interventions.', 'Structure, Activation, and Regulation of NOX2: At the Crossroad between the Innate Immunity and Oxidative Stress-Mediated Pathologies.', 'NADPH Oxidase 2 Has a Crucial Role in Cell Cycle Progression of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'ROS and miRNA Dysregulation in Ovarian Cancer Development, Angiogenesis and Therapeutic Resistance.']"""

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has the potential to cost-efficiently accelerate precision medicine trials to improve clinical efficacy and diminish costs and toxicity. However, comprehensive ctDNA profiling in metastatic prostate cancer to date has been limited.  Methods:   A combination of targeted and low-pass whole genome sequencing was performed on plasma cell-free DNA and matched white blood cell germline DNA in 364 blood samples from 217 metastatic prostate cancer patients.  Results:   ctDNA was detected in 85.9% of baseline samples, correlated to line of therapy and was mirrored by circulating tumor cell enumeration of synchronous blood samples. Comprehensive profiling of the androgen receptor (AR) revealed a continuous increase in the fraction of patients with intra-AR structural variation, from 15.4% during first-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer therapy to 45.2% in fourth line, indicating a continuous evolution of AR during the course of the disease. Patients displayed frequent alterations in DNA repair deficiency genes (18.0%). Additionally, the microsatellite instability phenotype was identified in 3.81% of eligible samples (≥ 0.1 ctDNA fraction). Sequencing of non-repetitive intronic and exonic regions of PTEN, RB1, and TP53 detected biallelic inactivation in 47.5%, 20.3%, and 44.1% of samples with ≥ 0.2 ctDNA fraction, respectively. Only one patient carried a clonal high-impact variant without a detectable second hit. Intronic high-impact structural variation was twice as common as exonic mutations in PTEN and RB1. Finally, 14.6% of patients presented false positive variants due to clonal hematopoiesis, commonly ignored in commercially available assays.  Conclusions:   ctDNA profiles appear to mirror the genomic landscape of metastatic prostate cancer tissue and may cost-efficiently provide somatic information in clinical trials designed to identify predictive biomarkers. However, intronic sequencing of the interrogated tumor suppressors challenges the ubiquitous focus on coding regions and is vital, together with profiling of synchronous white blood cells, to minimize erroneous assignments which in turn may confound results and impede true associations in clinical trials.""","""['Markus Mayrhofer', 'Bram De Laere', 'Tom Whitington', 'Peter Van Oyen', 'Christophe Ghysel', 'Jozef Ampe', 'Piet Ost', 'Wim Demey', 'Lucien Hoekx', 'Dirk Schrijvers', 'Barbara Brouwers', 'Willem Lybaert', 'Els Everaert', 'Daan De Maeseneer', 'Michiel Strijbos', 'Alain Bols', 'Karen Fransis', 'Steffi Oeyen', 'Pieter-Jan van Dam', 'Gert Van den Eynden', 'Annemie Rutten', 'Markus Aly', 'Tobias Nordström', 'Steven Van Laere', 'Mattias Rantalainen', 'Prabhakar Rajan', 'Lars Egevad', 'Anders Ullén', 'Jeffrey Yachnin', 'Luc Dirix', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Johan Lindberg']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Genome Med""","""['Concordance of Circulating Tumor DNA and Matched Metastatic Tissue Biopsy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical and genomic insights into circulating tumor DNA-based alterations across the spectrum of metastatic hormone-sensitive and castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Compound Genomic Alterations of TP53, PTEN, and RB1 Tumor Suppressors in Localized and Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Using circulating cell-free DNA to monitor personalized cancer therapy.', 'Clinical Utility of Analyzing Circulating Tumor DNA in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.', 'AR and PI3K Genomic Profiling of Cell-free DNA Can Identify Poor Responders to Lutetium-177-PSMA Among Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Potential non-invasive biomarkers in tumor immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: response and prognosis prediction.', 'Overview of the role of liquid biopsy in cancer management.', 'Tumor-informed or tumor-agnostic circulating tumor DNA as a biomarker for risk of recurrence in resected colorectal cancer patients.', 'Circulating Tumor DNA-A Novel Biomarker of Tumor Progression and Its Favorable Detection Techniques.']"""

In the present work, based on the highly efficient catalytic properties of gold nanoclusters, a novel system for optical determination of citrate was successfully established under optimized conditions. Cysteine-capped gold nanoclusters (Cys-AuNCs) are shown to have an intrinsic peroxidase-mimetic activity. In the presence of H2O2, Cys-AuNCs nanostructures are able to catalyse the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with high efficiency to produce a blue dye (with an absorbance maximum at 650 nm). Citrate has carboxylic and hydroxyl groups that can bind with free amino and free carboxyl cysteine groups via hydrogen bonds, thus creating a coating on the surface of the gold nanocluster and inhibiting the cluster oxidation activity. Accordingly, a visual, sensitive and simple colorimetric method using Cys-AuNCs as peroxidase mimetic was developed for detecting citrate. A suitable linear relationship for citrate was obtained for the range of 0.5 to 1000 μM. The limit of detection (LOD) of the proposed method was calculated as 0.1 μM and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was obtained to be less than 4.0%. Moreover, the biosensor was used to perform a paper assay on a Y-shaped microfluidic device and make use of the distinctive features of microchannels such as short response time, very low reagent volume required, low fabrication cost etc. A detection limit of 0.4 μM was achieved through the paper test and a good linear range was observed between 1.0 μM-10 mM. The proposed method was further applied to citrate detection in the human urine sample.""","""['Shima Abarghoei', 'Neda Fakhri', 'Yasaman Sadat Borghei', 'Morteza Hosseini', 'Mohammad Reza Ganjali']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc""","""['A novel colorimetric assay for rapid detection of cysteine and Hg²⁺ based on gold clusters.', 'Paper based colorimetric detection of miRNA-21 using Ag/Pt nanoclusters.', 'An ultra-sensitive and colorimetric sensor for copper and iron based on glutathione-functionalized gold nanoclusters.', 'A Rapid Method for the Detection of Sarcosine Using SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs for Prostate Cancer Sensing.', 'Citrate in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Paper-based analytical devices for point-of-need applications.', 'High performance multi-purpose nanostructured thin films by inkjet printing: Au micro-electrodes and SERS substrates.', 'Biomarker Detection in Early Diagnosis of Cancer: Recent Achievements in Point-of-Care Devices Based on Paper Microfluidics.', 'Paper-Based Colorimetric Detection of miRNA-21 Using Pre-Activated Nylon Membrane and Peroxidase-Mimetic Activity of Cysteamine-Capped Gold Nanoparticles.', 'Colorimetric Paper-Based Sensors against Cancer Biomarkers.']"""

Similar 5-year relapse-free survival rates were achieved in both groups, but noninferiority of hypofractionation was not confirmed for genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity. Here, we present the secondary trial endpoint on patient-reported quality of life.  Methods and materials:   A total of 820 patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer were randomized to hypofractionation (19 fractions of 3.4 Gy) or conventional fractionation (39 fractions of 2.0 Gy). Quality of life was measured using a validated questionnaire, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Prostate Cancer 25 module. Subscales (score range, 0-100) on urinary symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, symptoms related to androgen deprivation therapy, sexual function, and sexual activity were analyzed. Changes from baseline of at least 5 points were considered clinically relevant. Inferiority of hypofractionation for separate subscales was rejected if the mean difference in the 3-year incidence of clinically relevant deterioration between treatments was <8.0%.  Results:   A total of 697 men were eligible for this quality-of-life analysis. Baseline characteristics were comparable between both groups. At 3-year follow-up, the incidence of clinically relevant deterioration of urinary symptoms was 33% for both treatments (difference 0.49% in favor of conventional fractionation; 90% confidence interval, -7.20% to 8.18%). Such deterioration of gastrointestinal symptoms was reported in 38% of patients receiving hypofractionation versus 36% of patients receiving conventional fractionation (2.03% in favor of conventional fractionation; 90% confidence interval, -6.18% to 10.23%). Therefore, we could not demonstrate noninferiority of hypofractionation for genitourinary and gastrointestinal quality of life. For all other subscales, noninferiority of hypofractionation was demonstrated.  Conclusions:   Noninferiority of the hypofractionated treatment was not demonstrated for genitourinary and gastrointestinal quality of life, and therefore we cannot rule out that relevant differences may exist between both treatments.

The goal of our study was to assess unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics in patients with omitted lymphadenectomy (PLND) during radical prostatectomy based on the nomogram proposed by Briganti and colleagues. In 2011, 200 patients undertook radical prostatectomy in our institution. Among them 53 patients who fulfilled Briganti criteria and in whom we omitted lymphadenectomy based on current guidelines. Unfavorable clinicopathological features considered were: stage T3, positive surgical margins or biochemical relapse (BCR). We registered biopsy Gleason score 6 in 34 patients, and 19 patients had Gleason score 7. Stage pT2 was seen in 49 patients, and pT3 in 4. Glea-son score after radical prostatectomy was upgraded from GS 6 to GS 7 in 20 patients (37%) and reduced in 1 patient (2%). After a median follow-up of 49 (44-56) months, there were 12 (22.6%) patients with BCR.

The Department of Urology at the Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center is the oldest urology institution in the Republic of Croatia. The Department was established in 1894, when the new Sestre milosrdnice Hospital was open in Vinogradska cesta in Zagreb. It was then that doctor Dragutin Mašek founded the so-called III Department, which, in addition to treating urology patients, also treated patients with conditions of the ear, nose and throat, eye diseases and dermatologic conditions. Dragutin Mašek had already realized that medicine would soon be divided into fields and had assigned younger doctors joining the III Department to specific fields. As a result, urology was given to Aleksandar Blašković, who founded the first independent department of urology in Croatia in 1926. In 1927, he was appointed Professor of urology at the Zagreb School of Medicine, where he established the first department of urology and was giving lectures and practicals. Under his leadership, the Department of Urology was given the status of a Clinic, a teach-ing department, the first of its kind in Croatia. Owing to all his activities in the field of urology, the history remembers him as the ""father of modern Croatian urology"". Over the course of the following years, department chairs had changed, but luckily for the patients, approach to work had not. Conscientiousness, trust, competence and charity. After all, charity is the idea that the hospital carries even in its name, after the Sisters of Charity who had founded it. In all the decades, the Department of Urology has been following global development paths, objectively legging behind top facilities in the world by only a few years. Overall professional and scientific urology activities culminated in 1998, when the Clinic became the Reference Center of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Croatia for prostate cancer, and in 2011, when it became the European Board of Urology Certified Center. All that has been achieved could not have been done without wholehearted help and cooperation of the nurses, as well as every other department employee from the beginnings of urology until today. Despite its rich history, the Department does not rest on laurels.

The goal of this work was to develop an automated bone lesion classification algorithm to classify lesions in NaF PET/CT images.  Methods:   A nuclear medicine physician manually identified and classified 1751 bone lesions in NaF PET/CT images from 37 subjects with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, 14 of which (598 lesions) were analyzed by three additional physicians. Lesions were classified on a five-point scale from definite benign to definite metastatic lesions. Classification agreement between physicians was assessed using Fleiss' κ. To perform fully automated lesion classification, three different lesion detection methods based on thresholding were assessed: SUV > 10 g ml-1, SUV > 15 g ml-1, and a statistically optimized regional thresholding (SORT) algorithm. For each ROI in the image, 172 different imaging features were extracted, including PET, CT, and spatial probability features. These imaging features were used as inputs into different machine learning algorithms. The impact of different deterministic factors affecting classification performance was assessed.  Results:   The factors that most impacted classification performance were the machine learning algorithm and the lesion identification method. Random forests (RF) had the highest classification performance. For lesion segmentation, using SORT (AUC = 0.95 [95%CI = 0.94-0.95], sensitivity = 88% [86%-90%], and specificity = 0.89 [0.87-0.90]) resulted in superior classification performance (p < 0.001) compared to SUV > 10 g ml-1 (AUC = 0.87) and SUV > 15 g ml-1 (AUC = 0.86). While there was only moderate agreement between physicians in lesion classification (κ = 0.53 [95% CI = 0.52-0.53]), classification performance was high using any of the four physicians as ground truth (AUC range: 0.91-0.93).  Conclusion:   We have developed the first whole-body automatic disease classification tool for NaF PET using RF, and demonstrated its ability to replicate different physicians' classification tendencies.

Methods:   A single-centre, IRB approved, prospective STARD compliant 3 T MRI test dataset of 203 patients was generated to test validity and generalisability of previously reported 1.5 T mp-MRI diagnostic models. All patients included within the test dataset underwent 3 T mp-MRI, comprising T2, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging followed by transperineal template ± targeted index lesion biopsy. Separate diagnostic models (transition zone (TZ) and peripheral zone (PZ)) were applied to respective zones. Sensitivity/specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) were calculated for the two zone-specific models. Two radiologists (A and B) independently Likert scored test 3 T mp-MRI dataset, allowing ROC analysis for each radiologist for each prostate zone.  Results:   Diagnostic models applied to the test dataset demonstrated a ROC-AUC = 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.81) in the PZ and 0.68 (95% CI 0.61-0.75) in the TZ. Radiologist A/B had a ROC-AUC = 0.78/0.74 in the PZ and 0.69/0.69 in the TZ. Radiologists A and B each scored 51 patients in the PZ and 41 and 45 patients respectively in the TZ as Likert 3. The PZ model demonstrated a ROC-AUC = 0.65/0.67 for the patients Likert scored as indeterminate by radiologist A/B respectively, whereas the TZ model demonstrated a ROC-AUC = 0.74/0.69.  Conclusion:   Zone-specific mp-MRI diagnostic models demonstrate generalisability between 1.5 and 3 T mp-MRI protocols and show similar classification performance to experienced radiologists for prostate cancer detection. Results also indicate the ability of diagnostic models to classify cases with an indeterminate radiologist score.

Since the IFNL4-ΔG allele has been linked to impaired viral clearance, we hypothesized that potential exposure to sexually transmitted pathogens, as assessed by the number of lifetime sexual partners, may increase prostate cancer risk in an IFNL4-ΔG-dependent manner. Accordingly, we find that men with 10 or more sexual partners and at least one copy of IFNL4-ΔG have a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer while those with the same number of partners but lacking IFNL4-ΔG do not. Moreover, a test for effect modification shows a positive interaction between the number of lifetime partners and IFNL4-ΔG in the development of aggressive prostate cancer.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the best examples of multistep carcinogenesis. Knowing the anatomopathological characteristics of CRC will certainly affect our therapeutic approaches. We conducted a retrospective epidemiological and anatomopathological study in the Department of Visceral Surgery at the Military Hospital Moulay Ismail, Meknes over a period of 5 years from January 2012 to December 2016. The study involved 36 patients: 14 women and 22 men. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological profile and the anatomopathological features of colorectal cancers. The analysis of our results shows a specific epidemiological profile which is characteristic of a type of colorectal cancer affecting younger subjects, mainly male patients. Sporadic carcers are largely predominant, occurring mainly in the rectosigmoid region. A low degree of differentiation of adenocarcinomas with mucinous features is correlated with advanced TNM and Aster Coller staging and with lymph node status with poor prognosis.

Material and methods:   Fifty-eight formalin fixed paraffin blocks from diagnosed cases of prostatic tumours with different grade, and stages were included in this study. Ki-67 expression was examined immunohistochemically by using monoclonal mouse anti-human Ki67 IS626. The results were correlated with Gleason score and tumour differentiation and stage.  Results:   The frequency of histological types was as follow: 11 cases of benign prostate, atic hyperplasia (19%) and 47 cases of prostatic cancer (81%). Our results stated that prostatic adenocarcinoma among Sudanese patients was of low grade which means tumours are less aggressive. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that Ki-67 expression in prostatic carcinoma smears was correlated significantly with the degree of Gleason score (P < 0.05).

The 2-imidazoline derivatives were evaluated as potential inhibitors of human monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B. Among the 2-imidazolines, good potency inhibitors were discovered with compound 9p (IC50 = 0.012 µM) being the most potent MAO-B inhibitor, while compound 9d (IC50 = 0.751 µM) was the most potent MAO-A inhibitor of the series. These potencies are in the same range as those of reference MAO inhibitors used in the clinic. Among 33 compounds evaluated, 13 exhibited IC50 values in the submicromolar range for the inhibition of an MAO isoform. It is postulated that the imidazoline moieties of some of these inhibitors may be recognized by the imidazoline I2-binding site of MAO. Good potency MAO inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as depression and Parkinson's disease, and future application for the treatment of prostate cancer, congestive heart failure and Alzheimer's disease.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that play important roles in gene expression by removing the acetyl group from histone. The aberrant expression of HDAC in human tumors is related with the onset of human cancer. Especially, HDAC2, which belongs to HDAC class I composed of HDAC 1, 2, 3 and 8, has been reported to be highly expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) where it downregulates the expression of p53, resulting in an inhibition of apoptosis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of RA in comparison with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), an HDAC inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent, on survival and apoptosis of PCa cell lines, PC-3 and DU145, and the expression of HDAC. RA decreased the cell proliferation in cell viability assay, and inhibited the colony formation and tumor spheroid formation. Additionally, RA induced early- and late-stage apoptosis of PC-3 and DU145 cells in Annexin V assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, respectively. In western blot analysis, RA inhibited the expression of HDAC2, as SAHA did. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 were downregulated by RA, whereas p21 was upregulated.

Outcomes for this cancer have not been well characterized.  Materials and methods:   Subjects with a PPS diagnosed between 1973 and 2014 were identified in the SEER database. Subjects were stratified by disease stage and types of therapies received. Disease-specific survival (DSS) and Overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and cohorts were compared with a univariate and multivariable Cox regression.  Results:   The incidence of PPS among all prostate cancer diagnoses was 0.02%. Subjects younger than age 26 years at diagnosis represented 29% of cases, and 32% of primary prostate sarcomas were rhabdomyosarcoma histology.  Rhabdomyosarcoma histologies:   The median age at diagnosis was 9 years. Between age 0-25 years rhabdomyosarcoma accounted for 96.4% of primary prostate sarcoma diagnoses, after age 25 rhabdomyosarcoma represented 15% of new diagnoses. The 10-year DSS and OS for rhabdomyosarcoma was 47% and 44%.  Non-rhabdomyosarcoma histologies:   The median age at diagnosis was 71 years. The most common diagnoses were leiomyosarcoma (33%) and carcinosarcoma (28%). Localized, regional, or distant disease occurred in 40%, 34%, and 26% of cases. The 10-year DSS and OS were 26% and 14%. In locally advanced cases, RT added to surgery trended toward improved DSS (P = 0.10).  Conclusions:   Disease-specific survival and OS for non-rhabdomyosarcoma histologies appear inferior to those of rhabdomyosarcoma. The addition of RT to surgical resection may improve DSS in locally advanced non-rhabdomyosarcoma.

Herbal substances and endemic herbal extracts were combined with Paclitaxel drug. IC50 doses were identified as real-time online. The most effective synergistic doses were determined according to isobologram analysis. The apoptotic effects of effective combined doses were evaluated by TUNEL, Annexin V, and JC-1 methods.

However, the extent to which access to GPs determines the route that patients take to obtain a cancer diagnosis is unknown.  Methods:   We used a linked dataset of cancer registry and hospital records of patients with a cancer diagnosis between 2006 and 2010 across eight different cancer sites. Primary outcomes were defined as 'desirable routes to diagnosis' [screen-detected and 2-week wait (TWW) referrals] and 'less desirable routes' [emergency presentations and death certificate only (DCO)]. All other routes (GP referral, inpatient elective and other outpatient) were specified as the reference category. Geographical access was measured as travel time in minutes from patients to their GP, and multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate relative risk ratios (RRR).  Results:   Longer travel was associated with increased risk of diagnosis via emergency and DCO, but decreased risk of diagnosis via screening and TWW. Patients travelling over 30 minutes had the highest risk of a DCO diagnosis, which was statistically significant for breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, stomach and ovarian cancers (compared with patients with travel times ≤10 minutes: RRR 5.89, 7.02, 2.30, 4.75, 10.41; P < 0.01 and 3.51, P < 0.05).

Objective:   To investigate whether treatment of Gleason score 9-10 prostate cancer with MaxRP vs MaxRT was associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM) risk.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study cohort comprised 639 men with clinical T1-4,N0M0 biopsy Gleason score 9-10 prostate cancer. Between February 6, 1992, and April 26, 2013, a total of 80 men were consecutively treated with MaxRT at the Chicago Prostate Cancer Center, and 559 men were consecutively treated with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection at the Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center. Follow-up started on the day of prostate EBRT or RP and concluded on October 27, 2017.  Exposures:   Of the 559 men managed with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection, 88 (15.7%) received adjuvant EBRT, 49 (8.8%) received ADT, and 50 (8.9%) received both.  Main outcomes and measures:   Treatment propensity score-adjusted risk of PCSM and ACM and the likelihood of equivalence of these risks between treatments using a plausibility index.

Each patient was matched based on age, sex, race, and year of diagnosis to 50 controls from a general population who were diagnosed with the index cancer.  Results:   Patients with myeloma with breast, prostate, or lung cancer were more commonly diagnosed at an early stage, whereas the stage distribution did not differ significantly among patients with melanoma, colorectal cancer, or bladder cancer.

However, the cumulative incidence function of cancer-related death did not differ (subhazard ratios, 0.84-0.99) and was surpassed by myeloma-related deaths (23% to 35% at 5 years). In patients with lung cancer, cancer-related mortality was uniquely lower among patients with myeloma (subhazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.68), even after adjustment for stage of disease.

Design:   A secondary analysis of findings from a cross-sectional national online survey.  Sample:   Respondents were sampled and stratified by cancer type and geographic region to approximate the cancer-affected population of the United States. Breast, prostate, and colorectal were the most common cancers reported. Across surveys, the majority of respondents were female (57%), over 55 (60%), and white (70%) and had at least some college (36%).  Methods:   Six online surveys were administered to cohorts of approximately 500 unique cancer patients and survivors. Survey topics included: (1) diagnosis, (2) treatment planning, (3) communication with providers, (4) insurance and financial concerns, (5) quality of life, side effects, and symptoms, and (6) survivorship and end-of-life. Descriptive analyses were used to explore psychosocial needs and experiences across three domains of patient-centered value in oncology.  Findings:   Each survey received 500-527 responses. Respondents most commonly reported needing more information regarding their insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs (65%), access to clinical trials (89%), and support organizations (45%). Forty-one percent were very or extremely distressed about cancer's impact on their ability to work and over 25% reported high-levels of cancer-related financial hardship.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the supplementary oral 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to standard radiation therapy as a novel radioprotective approach that would not compromise the antitumor effect of radiation in normal rectal and bladder mucosa in a syngenic prostate cancer (PCa) model.  Methods:   To evaluate the radiosensitizing effect of ALA in vitro, clonogenic survival assays were performed in DU145, PC3, and MyC-CaP cell lines. To evaluate the effect of ALA in vivo a single dose (25 Gy) of radiation with or without ALA was given to healthy mice. Next, a syngenic PCa model of MyC-CaP cells in FVB mice was created, and multiple doses (12 Gy total) of radiation were administered to the mouse pelvic area with or without ALA administration. Resected tumors, recta, and urinary bladders were immunostained with antibodies against Ki-67, γ-H2AX, CD204, and uroplakin-III. Total RNA levels in recta and urinary bladders were analyzed via RT2 Profiler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays related to ""Stress & Toxicity PathwayFinder,"" ""Mitochondria,"" and ""Inflammasomes.""  Results:   The addition of in vitro single or in vivo repeated administration of exogenous ALA acted as a radiosensitizer for PCa cells. Rectal toxicity was characterized by histological changes including loss of surface epithelium, fibrosis, severe DNA damage, and the aggregation of M2 macrophages. Urinary bladder toxicity was characterized by bladder wall thickening and urothelium denuding. The higher dose (300 mg/kg/day) of ALA exerted a better radioprotective profile than the lower dose (30 mg/kg/day) in normal recta and urinary bladders. Out of the 252 genes tested, 35 (13.4%) were detected as relevant genes which may be involved in the radioprotective role of ALA administration. These included interleukin-1a (IL-1a), IL-1b, IL-12, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL3, and NLRP3.

Clinical genetic data from multigene testing can provide insights into the germline pathogenic variant (PV) spectrum and correlates in men with PCA unselected for metastatic disease to optimize identification of men for genetic evaluation and management.  Methods:   A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted of de-identified clinical genetic testing data from a large commercial genetic testing laboratory in the US. ICD-10 claims codes were used to identify men with PCA, along with family history data. Gleason score was abstracted from test request forms. Overall PV rate among men with PCA was estimated, along with PVs in DNA repair genes. Family history and Gleason score association to germline DNA repair PVs was assessed using Fisher's exact test with correction for false-discovery.  Results:   As of August 2017, genetic results were available on 1328 men with PCA. Overall PV rate was 15.6%, with 10.9% of PV in DNA repair genes. PVs were most commonly identified in BRCA2 (4.5%), CHEK2 (2.2%), ATM (1.8%), and BRCA1 (1.1%). Breast cancer family history was significantly associated with germline DNA repair PVs (OR 1.89, [95%CI 1.33, 2.68], P = 0.003).

Conclusions:   A substantial proportion of men with PCA unselected for metastatic disease carry germline DNA repair PVs.

CDC6 has been associated with oncogenic activities in human cancers; however, the clinical significance of CDC6 in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether the CDC6 mRNA expression level is a diagnostic and prognostic marker in PCa.  Methods:   The study subjects included 121 PCa patients and 66 age-matched benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients. CDC6 expression was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical (IH) staining, and then compared according to the clinicopathological characteristics of PCa.  Results: CDC6 mRNA expression was significantly higher in PCa tissues than in BPH control tissues (P = 0.005). In addition, CDC6 expression was significantly higher in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (> 20 ng/mL), a high Gleason score, and advanced stage than in those with low PSA levels, a low Gleason score, and earlier stage, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high expression of CDC6 was significantly associated with advanced stage (≥ T3b) (odds ratio [OR], 3.005; confidence interval [CI], 1.212-7.450; P = 0.018) and metastasis (OR, 4.192; CI, 1.079-16.286; P = 0.038).

Here, we explored the transcriptional changes associated with metastatic progression of multifocal hormone-naive PC.  Methods:   Using total RNA-sequencing, we analysed laser micro-dissected primary PC foci (n = 23), adjacent normal prostate tissue samples (n = 23) and lymph node metastases (n = 9) from ten hormone-naive PC patients. Genes important for PC progression were identified using differential gene expression and clustering analysis. From these, two multi-gene-based expression signatures (models) were developed, and their prognostic potential was evaluated using Cox-regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses in three independent radical prostatectomy (RP) cohorts (>650 patients).  Results:   We identified several novel PC-associated transcripts deregulated during PC progression, and these transcripts were used to develop two novel gene-expression-based prognostic models. The models showed independent prognostic potential in three RP cohorts (n = 405, n = 107 and n = 91), using biochemical recurrence after RP as the primary clinical endpoint.

Here, we modified the oncolytic group B adenovirus enadenotucirev to express a stroma-targeted bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE). This BiTE bound fibroblast activation protein on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and CD3ε on T cells, leading to potent T-cell activation and fibroblast death. Treatment of fresh clinical biopsies, including malignant ascites and solid prostate cancer tissue, with FAP-BiTE-encoding virus induced activation of tumor-infiltrating PD1+ T cells to kill CAFs. In ascites, this led to depletion of CAF-associated immunosuppressive factors, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased gene expression of markers of antigen presentation, T-cell function, and trafficking. M2-like ascites macrophages exhibited a proinflammatory repolarization, indicating spectrum-wide alteration of the tumor microenvironment. With this approach, we have actively killed both cancer cells and tumor fibroblasts, reversing CAF-mediated immunosuppression and yielding a potent single-agent therapeutic that is ready for clinical assessment.

Recent evidence suggests that KLOTHO functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting Wnt signaling. KLOTHO gene silencing, including DNA methylation, has been observed in some human cancers. Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling plays a significant role in aging, and its silencing may be related to prostate cancer and other types of cancers. Thus, we investigated whether the expression of the anti-aging gene KLOTHO was associated with epigenetic changes in prostate cancer cell lines. KLOTHO mRNA was detected in the 22Rv1 cell line while it was not detected in DU145 and PC-3 cell lines. The restoration of KLOTHO mRNA in the DU145 and PC-3 cell lines was induced with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Methylation-specific PCR was performed to determine the specific CpG sites in the KLOTHO promoter responsible for expression. In addition, the level of methylation was assessed in each CpG by performing bisulfite sequencing and quantitative pyrosequencing analysis. The results suggested a remarkable inverse relationship between KLOTHO expression and promoter methylation in prostate cancer cell lines.""","""['Minkyu Seo', 'Min Su Kim', 'Ara Jang', 'Hyun Joo Chung', 'Yoohun Noh', 'Do-Hee Kim', 'Jaehyouk Lee', 'Kisung Ko', 'Soon Chul Myung']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Anim Cells Syst (Seoul)""","""['The anti-aging gene KLOTHO is a novel target for epigenetic silencing in human cervical carcinoma.', 'Promoter CpG-Site Methylation of the KAI1 Metastasis Suppressor Gene Contributes to Its Epigenetic Repression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic silencing of the tumor suppressor klotho in human breast cancer.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Klotho acts as a tumor suppressor in cancers.', 'Undetected αKlotho in serum is associated with the most aggressive phenotype of breast cancer.', 'Role of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) and αKlotho in Cancer.', 'Klotho: An Elephant in Aging Research.']"""

Primary or metastatic spine tumors sit at a unique intersection of these 2 realms. Our objective was to evaluate the prevalence, outcomes, and complications after the management of SCI arising from spinal tumors.  Methods:   In the present retrospective evaluation, all patients with SCI and a diagnosis of primary or metastatic spinal cancer who had been admitted to the inpatient rehabilitation unit at a level 1 trauma center from January 2003 to January 2014 were evaluated. The demographic data (age, sex, race/ethnicity), tumor characteristics, American Spinal Injury Association score, and complications were evaluated.  Results:   A total of 757 SCI entries were identified, and 685 unique patients met our inclusion criteria. Of those, 81 had SCIs due to spinal tumors (11.8% of all SCIs and 19.2% of nontraumatic SCIs).

Re-activation of the androgen receptor (AR) is a major mechanism of resistance. Interrogating our in vivo derived ENZR model, we discovered that transcription factor STAT3 not only displayed increased nuclear localization but also bound to and facilitated AR activity. We observed increased STAT3 S727 phosphorylation in ENZR cells, which has been previously reported to facilitate AR binding. Strikingly, ENZR cells were more sensitive to inhibition with STAT3 DNA-binding inhibitor galiellalactone (GPA500) compared to CRPC cells. Treatment with GPA500 suppressed AR activity and significantly reduced expression of Cyclin D1, thus reducing cell cycle progression into S phase and hindering cell proliferation. In vivo, GPA500 reduced tumor volume and serum PSA in ENZR xenografts. Lastly, the combination of ENZ and GPA500 was additive in the inhibition of AR activity and proliferation in LNCaP and CRPC cells, providing rationale for combination therapy.

This is partly attributed to the lack of suitable in vitro assays that are good models of tumor growth in bone. Here, we take advantage of a novel ex vivo model of bone colonization to report a series of pyrrolopyrazolone small molecules that inhibit cancer cell invasion and ex vivo tumor growth in bone at single-digit micromolar concentration. We find that the compounds modulated the expression levels of genes associated with bone-forming osteoblasts, bone-destroying osteoclasts, cancer cell viability and metastasis.

Novel non-invasive tests that can identify clinically significant (intermediate-risk and high-risk) diseases are needed to improve risk stratification and monitoring of prostate cancer patients. Here, we investigated a panel of six DNA methylation biomarkers in urine samples collected post-digital rectal exam from patients undergoing prostate biopsy, for their utility to guide decision making for diagnostic biopsy and early detection of aggressive prostate cancer.  Results:   We recruited 408 patients in risk categories ranging from benign to low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer from three international cohorts. Patients were separated into 2/3 training and 1/3 validation cohorts. Methylation biomarkers were analyzed in post-digital rectal exam urinary sediment DNA by quantitative MethyLight assay and investigated for their association with any or aggressive prostate cancers. We developed a Prostate Cancer Urinary Epigenetic (ProCUrE) assay based on an optimal two-gene (HOXD3 and GSTP1) LASSO model, derived from methylation values in the training cohort, and assessed ProCUrE's diagnostic and prognostic ability for prostate cancer in both the training and validation cohorts. ProCUrE demonstrated improved prostate cancer diagnosis and identification of patients with clinically significant disease in both the training and validation cohorts. Using three different risk stratification criteria (Gleason score, D'Amico criteria, and CAPRA score), we found that the positive predictive value for ProCUrE was higher (59.4-78%) than prostate specific antigen (PSA) (38.2-72.1%) for all risk category comparisons. ProCUrE also demonstrated additive value to PSA in identifying GS ≥ 7 PCa compared to PSA alone (DeLong's test p = 0.039), as well as additive value to the PCPT risk calculator for identifying any PCa and GS ≥ 7 PCa (DeLong's test p = 0.011 and 0.022, respectively).

Almost all malignancies may occur in combination, the most common combination being gastrointestinal cancer with respiratory or urogenital tract cancer and with breast cancer in females.  Case report:   In 1999, a 66-year-old patient was diagnosed with a rectosigmoid tumor histologically proven as adenocarcinoma. Rectosigmoid resection was performed, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and the Mayo Clinic FU/FA chemotherapy regimen. Radical nephrectomy was performed in January 2005 due to right kidney tumor, histologically detected as clear cell carcinoma. In February 2006, the patient underwent bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy for biopsy-verified adenocarcinoma of the prostate with PSA 20.8 ng/ml. Radical prostatectomy was performed in April 2006. Histology demonstrated moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in both prostatic lobes classified as Gleason score 4 (1+3), without invasion into the capsule or seminal vesicles infiltration. In June 2016, a native X-ray of the lungs revealed a subpleural small dense node in the right upper pulmonary field. PET/CT of the trunk was also performed showing liver metastasis and pulmonary deposits, including enlargement of the mediastinal nodules. In October 2016, liver biopsy was taken and the serum level of neuron-specific enolase (NSE: 93 ng/ml) was measured. Histology demonstrated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the small cell type. In November 2016, palliative chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide administered once a month was initiated. After 4 chemotherapy cycles, no deposits on the liver were detected by sonography. A native X-ray image of the lungs still showed a 15mm deposit, but NSE levels returned to normal. In March 2017, treatment continued with palliative radiotherapy of the right lung, mediastinal lymphatic nodes and prophylactic radiotherapy of the skull was planned as a next step. In August 2017, the patient died due to renal function failure and deterioration of the general condition.  Conclusion:   The patient worked in uranium mines and underwent radio-chemotherapy after the first malignancy - rectosigmoid tumor. Genetic examination was not performed. The patient died of therapeutic complications of the last malignancy. Our case report does not confirm findings described so far - a shortening interval between malignancies - but confirms their increasing aggressiveness.

The aim of this paper is to determine the impact of sulforaphane and its natural analog alyssin on the anticancer activity of the well-known anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil. The type of drug-drug interactions was determined in prostate and colon cancer cell lines. Confocal microscopy, western blot and flow cytometry methods were employed to determine the mechanism of cytotoxic and cytostatic action of the combinations. The study revealed that additive or synergistic interactions were observed between 5-fluorouracil and both isothiocyanates, which enhanced the anticancer activity of 5-fluorouracil, particularly in colon cancer cell lines.

Recent studies demonstrate that monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) levels elevate with prostate cancer aggression and metastasis. In addition, MAOA inhibitor therapies have been reported as an effective means to reduce the metastasis of prostate cancer and extend mouse survival. Thus, these findings provide evidence that MAOA is promising for the treatment of metastatic and advanced prostate cancer. Herein, three isoniazid (INH)-dye conjugates were synthesized by conjugating MAOA inhibitor INH with mitochondria-targeting NIRF heptamethine dyes to improve the therapeutic efficacy of prostate cancer. These INH-dye conjugates could accumulate in PC-3 cellular mitochondria via organic anion transport peptide (OATP), increase ROS generation, and induce cancer cells apoptosis. In prostate cancer bearing xenografts, INH-dye conjugates showed significantly improved tumor-homing characteristics, resulting in potent antitumor activity via a reduction in MAOA activity.

However, virtually all tumors become resistant and recur as castration-resistant PCa, which has no durable cure. One major hurdle in the development of more effective therapies is the lack of preclinical models that adequately recapitulate the heterogeneity of PCa, significantly hindering the ability to accurately predict therapeutic response.  Objective:   To leverage the ex vivo culture method termed patient-derived explant (PDE) to examine the impact of PCa therapeutics on a patient-by-patient basis.  Design setting and participants:   Fresh PCa tissue from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy was cultured as PDEs to examine therapeutic response.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The impact of genomic and chemical perturbations in PDEs was assessed using various parameters (eg, AR levels, Ki67 staining, and desmoplastic indices).  Results and limitations:   PDE maintained the integrity of the native tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor tissue morphology, viability, and endogenous hormone signaling. Tumor cells in this model system exhibited de novo proliferative capacity. Examination of the native TME in the PDE revealed a first-in-field insight into patient-specific desmoplastic stromal indices and predicted responsiveness to AR-directed therapeutics.  Conclusions:   The PDE model allows for a comprehensive evaluation of individual tumors in their native TME to ultimately develop more effective therapeutic regimens tailored to individuals. Discernment of novel stromal markers may provide a basis for applying precision medicine in treating advanced PCa, which would have a transformative effect on patient outcomes.  Patient summary:   In this study, an innovative model system was used to more effectively mimic human disease. The patient-derived explant (PDE) system can be used to predict therapeutic response and identify novel targets in advanced disease. Thus, the PDE will be an asset for the development of novel metrics for the implementation of precision medicine in prostate cancer.The patient-derived explant (PDE) model allows for a comprehensive evaluation of individual human tumors in their native tumor microenvironment (TME).

Aberrant RGS2 expression has also been reported for other carcinomas in association to both positive and negative prognosis. In this study, we assessed RGS2 expression during PC progression in terms of regulation and impact on tumour phenotype and evaluated its prognostic value. Our experimental data suggest that the RGS2 downregulation seen in early PC is caused by hypoxia. In line with the common indolent phenotype of a primary PC, knockdown of RGS2 induced epithelial features and impaired metastatic properties. However, increased STAT3, TWIST1 and decreased E-cadherin expression suggest priming for EMT. Additionally, improved tumour cell survival and increased BCL-2 expression linked decreased RGS2 levels to fundamental tumour advantages. In contrast, high RGS2 levels in advanced PC were correlated to poor patient survival and a positive metastatic status.

Combined PTEN/TP53 alterations represent a major genotype of CRPC (25-30%) and are associated with poor outcomes. Using tumor-derived, castration-resistant Pten/Tp53 null luminal prostate cells for comprehensive, high-throughput, mechanism-based screening, we identified several vulnerabilities among >1900 compounds, including inhibitors of: PI3K/AKT/mTOR, the proteasome, the cell cycle, heat shock proteins, DNA repair, NFκB, MAPK, and epigenetic modifiers. HSP90 inhibitors were one of the most active compound classes in the screen and have clinical potential for use in drug combinations to enhance efficacy and delay the development of resistance. To inform future design of rational drug combinations, we tested ganetespib, a potent second-generation HSP90 inhibitor, as a single agent in multiple CRPC genotypes and phenotypes. Ganetespib decreased growth of endogenous Pten/Tp53 null tumors, confirming therapeutic activity in situ. Fifteen human CRPC LuCaP PDX-derived organoid models were assayed for responses to 110 drugs, and HSP90 inhibitors (ganetespib and onalespib) were among the select group of drugs (<10%) that demonstrated broad activity (>75% of models) at high potency (IC50 <1 µM). Ganetespib inhibits multiple targets, including AR and PI3K pathways, which regulate mutually compensatory growth and survival signals in some forms of CRPC. Combined with castration, ganetespib displayed deeper PDX tumor regressions and delayed castration resistance relative to either monotherapy.

Increased sarcosine concentrations in blood plasma and urine are manifested in sarcosinemia and in some other diseases such as prostate cancer. For this purpose, sarcosine detection using the nanomedicine approach was proposed. In this study, we have prepared superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with different modified surface area. Nanoparticles (NPs) were modified by chitosan (CS), and sarcosine oxidase (SOX). SPIONs without any modification were taken as controls. Methods and Results: The obtained NPs were characterized by physicochemical methods. The size of the NPs determined by the dynamic light scattering method was as follows: SPIONs/Au/NPs (100⁻300 nm), SPIONs/Au/CS/NPs (300⁻700 nm), and SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs (600⁻1500 nm). The amount of CS deposited on the NP surface was found to be 48 mg/mL for SPIONs/Au/CS/NPs and 39 mg/mL for SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs, and repeatability varied around 10%. Pseudo-peroxidase activity of NPs was verified using sarcosine, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a substrate. For TMB, all NPs tested evinced substantial pseudo-peroxidase activity at 650 nm. The concentration of SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs in the reaction mixture was optimized to 0⁻40 mg/mL. Trinder reaction for sarcosine detection was set up at 510 nm at an optimal reaction temperature of 37 °C and pH 8.0. The course of the reaction was linear for 150 min. The smallest amount of NPs that was able to detect sarcosine was 0.2 mg/well (200 µL of total volume) with the linear dependence y = 0.0011x - 0.0001 and the correlation coefficient r = 0.9992, relative standard deviation (RSD) 6.35%, limit of detection (LOD) 5 µM. The suggested method was further validated for artificial urine analysis (r = 0.99, RSD 21.35%, LOD 18 µM). The calculation between the detected and applied concentrations showed a high correlation coefficient (r = 0.99). NPs were tested for toxicity and no significant growth inhibition was observed in any model system (S. cerevisiae, S. aureus, E. coli). The hemolytic activity of the prepared NPs was similar to that of the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) control. The reaction system was further tested on real urine specimens. Conclusion: The proposed detection system allows the analysis of sarcosine at micromolar concentrations and to monitor changes in its levels as a potential prostate cancer marker. The whole system is suitable for low-cost miniaturization and point-of-care testing technology and diagnostic systems. This system is simple, inexpensive, and convenient for screening tests and telemedicine applications.""","""['Dagmar Uhlirova', 'Martina Stankova', 'Michaela Docekalova', 'Bozena Hosnedlova', 'Marta Kepinska', 'Branislav Ruttkay-Nedecky', 'Josef Ruzicka', 'Carlos Fernandez', 'Halina Milnerowicz', 'Rene Kizek']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Using bimetallic Au/Cu nanoplatelets for construction of facile and label-free inner filter effect-based photoluminescence sensing platform for sarcosine detection.', 'Fabrication of an amperometric sarcosine biosensor based on sarcosine oxidase/chitosan/CuNPs/c-MWCNT/Au electrode for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Colorimetric determination of sarcosine in urine samples of prostatic carcinoma by mimic enzyme palladium nanoparticles.', 'Recent developments in the synthesis, properties, and biomedical applications of core/shell superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with gold.', 'Toxicity assessment of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in different tissues.', 'Dinuclear and mononuclear metal(II) polypyridyl complexes against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum and their mode of action.', 'Overcoming Hurdles in Nanoparticle Clinical Translation: The Influence of Experimental Design and Surface Modification.', 'Aluminosilicate Nanocomposite on Genosensor: A Prospective Voltammetry Platform for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutant Analysis in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of measurement variability and error/variability due to modeling in DCE magnetic resonance imaging parameters.  Materials and methods:   Two prostate DCE scans were performed on 11 treatment-naïve patients with suspected or confirmed prostate peripheral zone cancer within an interval of less than two weeks. Tumor-suspicious and normal-appearing regions of interest (ROI) in the prostate peripheral zone were segmented. Different Tofts-Kety based models and different arterial input functions, with and without bolus arrival time (BAT) correction, were used to extract pharmacokinetic parameters. The percent repeatability coefficient (%RC) of fitted model parameters Ktrans, ve, and kep was calculated. Paired t-tests comparing parameters in tumor-suspicious ROIs and in normal-appearing tissue evaluated each parameter's sensitivity to pathology.  Results:   Although goodness-of-fit criteria favored the four-parameter extended Tofts-Kety model with the BAT correction included, the simplest two-parameter Tofts-Kety model overall yielded the best repeatability scores. The best %RC in the tumor-suspicious ROI was 63% for kep, 28% for ve, and 83% for Ktrans . The best p values for discrimination between tissues were p <10-5 for kep and Ktrans, and p = 0.11 for ve. Addition of the BAT correction to the models did not improve repeatability.  Conclusion:   The parameter kep, using an arterial input functions directly measured from blood signals, was more repeatable than Ktrans. Both Ktrans and kep values were highly discriminatory between healthy and diseased tissues in all cases.

Detection of serum free methylated GSTP1 (mGSTP1) DNA is associated with overall survival (OS) and response to docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in test and internal validation cohorts.  Objective:   To assess the relationship between serum free mGSTP1 and treatment outcomes in SYNERGY, a phase 3 multicentre randomised trial testing the addition of custirsen to first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel in mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Serum free mGSTP1 DNA was measured by a sensitive methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay in paired samples (baseline and after two cycles of docetaxel) from 600 patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Associations between serum free mGSTP1 at baseline, change in mGSTP1 after docetaxel, OS, and time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression were examined using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier methods.  Results and limitations:   Serum free mGSTP1 was detectable at baseline in 458 (81%) patients. Of those with detectable mGSTP1 at baseline, mGSTP1 became undetectable after two cycles in 243 (53%). Undetectable mGSTP1 at baseline was associated with longer OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.55; p<0.00001). The event of mGSTP1 becoming undetectable after two cycles of chemotherapy was associated with longer OS (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.29-0.46; p<0.00001) and longer time to PSA progression (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.35-0.56; p<0.00001). Associations between mGSTP1 and clinical outcomes were independent of other established prognostic variables. Analysis was limited by the lack of radiographic progression-free survival data.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to externally validate the prognostic role of a circulating epigenetic biomarker in mCRPC. Further studies are needed to validate serum free mGSTP1 as a surrogate endpoint for clinical trials and as a potential clinical decision tool.

We evaluated a new model using deep decision forests of image features in order to contour pelvic anatomy on treatment planning CTs. 193 CT scans from one UK and two US institutions for patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer from 2012-2016 were anonymized. A decision forest autosegmentation model was trained on a random selection of 94 images from Institution 1 and tested on 99 scans from Institution 1, 2, and 3. The accuracy of model contours was measured with the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the median slice-wise Hausdorff distance (MSHD) using clinical contours as the ground truth reference. Two comparison studies were performed. The accuracy of the model was compared to four commercial software packages on twenty randomly-selected images. Additionally, inter-observer variability (IOV) of contours between three radiation oncology experts and the original contours was evaluated on ten randomly-selected images. The highest median values of DSC across all institutions were 0.94-0.97 for bladder (with interquartile range, or IQR, of 0.92-0.98) and 0.96-0.97 (IQR 0.94-0.97) for femurs. Good agreement was seen for prostate, with median DSC 0.75-0.76 (IQR 0.67-0.82), and rectum, with median DSC 0.71-0.82 (IQR 0.63-0.87). The lowest median scores were 0.49-0.70 for seminal vesicles (IQR 0.31-0.79). For the commercial software comparison, model-based segmentation produced higher DSC than atlas-based segmentation, with decision forests producing highest DSC for all organs of interest. For the interobserver study, variability in DSC between observers was similar to the agreement between the model and ground truth. Deep decision forests of radiomic features can generate contours of pelvic anatomy with reasonable agreement with physician contours. This method could be useful for automated treatment planning, and autosegmentation may improve efficiency and increase standardization in the clinic.""","""['Meghan W Macomber', 'Mark Phillips', 'Ivan Tarapov', 'Rajesh Jena', 'Aditya Nori', 'David Carter', 'Loic Le Folgoc', 'Antonio Criminisi', 'Matthew J Nyflot']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Evaluating the clinical acceptability of deep learning contours of prostate and organs-at-risk in an automated prostate treatment planning process.', 'Technology assessment of automated atlas based segmentation in prostate bed contouring.', 'Vision 20/20: perspectives on automated image segmentation for radiotherapy.', 'Prostate Bed Delineation Guidelines for Postoperative Radiation Therapy: On Behalf Of The Francophone Group of Urological Radiation Therapy.', 'Clinical target volume and organs at risk segmentation for rectal cancer radiotherapy using the Flex U-Net network.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.', 'The role of MRI in prostate cancer: current and future directions.', 'Prostate Cancer Radiogenomics-From Imaging to Molecular Characterization.', 'Evaluation of auto-segmentation accuracy of cloud-based artificial intelligence and atlas-based models.']"""

Given limited research funding, allocating resources in alignment with societal burden is essential. However, evidence shows that such alignment does not typically occur. The objective of the present study was to provide an updated overview of site-specific cancer research investment in Canada and to explore potential discrepancies between the site-specific burden and the level of research investment.  Methods:   The 10 cancer sites with the highest mortality in 2015-which included brain, female breast, colorectal, leukemia, lung, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, and uterus-were selected for the analysis. Information about site-specific research investment and cancer burden (raw incidence and mortality) was obtained from the Canadian Cancer Research Survey and Statistics Canada's cansim (the Canadian Socio-Economic Information Management System) respectively. The ratio of site-specific research investment to site-specific burden was used as an indicator of overfunding (ratio > 1) or underfunding (ratio < 1).  Results:   The 3 cancer sites with the highest research investments were leukemia, prostate, and breast, which together represented 51.3% of 2015 cancer research funding. Conversely, the 3 cancer sites with the lowest investments were uterus, pancreas, and ovary, which together represented 7.8% of 2015 research funding. Relative to site-specific cancer burden, the lung, uterus, and colorectal sites were consistently the most underfunded.  Conclusions:   Observed discrepancies between cancer burden and research investment indicate that some cancer sites (such as lung, colorectal, and uterus) seem to be underfunded when site-specific incidence and mortality are taken into consideration.""","""['A C Coronado', 'C Finley', 'K Badovinac', 'J Han', 'J Niu', 'R Rahal']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Curr Oncol""","""['Investments in cancer research awarded to UK institutions and the global burden of cancer 2000-2013: a systematic analysis.', 'An analysis of discrepancies between United Kingdom cancer research funding and societal burden and a comparison to previous and United States values.', 'A comparison of cancer burden and research spending reveals discrepancies in the distribution of research funding.', 'The case for increased funding for research in pulmonary and critical care.', 'Systematic analysis of research underfunding in maternal and perinatal health.', ""Are we moving the dial?

Unlike most other PSMA agents with a urea backbone, CTT1057 is based on a phosphoramidate scaffold that irreversibly binds to PSMA. We conducted a first-in-humans phase I study of CTT1057 in patients with localized and metastatic prostate cancer. Methods: Two patient cohorts were recruited. Cohort A patients had biopsy-proven localized prostate cancer preceding radical prostatectomy, and cohort B patients had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Cohort A patients were imaged at multiple time points after intravenous injection with 362 ± 8 MBq of CTT1057 to evaluate the kinetics of CTT1057 and estimate radiation dose profiles. Mean organ-absorbed doses and effective doses were calculated. CTT1057 uptake in the prostate gland and regional lymph nodes was correlated with pathology, PSMA staining, and the results of conventional imaging. In cohort B, patients were imaged 60-120 min after injection of CTT1057. PET images were assessed for overall image quality, and areas of abnormal uptake were contrasted with conventional imaging. Results: In cohort A (n = 5), the average total effective dose was 0.023 mSv/MBq. The kidneys exhibited the highest absorbed dose, 0.067 mGy/MBq. The absorbed dose of the salivary glands was 0.015 mGy/MBq. For cohort B (n = 15), CTT1057 PET detected 97 metastatic lesions, and 44 of 56 bone metastases detected on CTT1057 PET (78.5%) were also detectable on bone scanning. Eight of 32 lymph nodes positive on CTT1057 PET (25%) were enlarged by size criteria on CT. Conclusion: CTT1057 is a promising novel phosphoramidate PSMA-targeting 18F-labeled PET radiopharmaceutical that demonstrates similar biodistribution to urea-based PSMA-targeted agents, with lower exposure to the kidneys and salivary glands. Metastatic lesions are detected with higher sensitivity on CTT1057 imaging than on conventional imaging. Further prospective studies with CTT1057 are warranted to elucidate its role in cancer imaging.""","""['Spencer C Behr', 'Rahul Aggarwal', 'Henry F VanBrocklin', 'Robert R Flavell', 'Kenneth Gao', 'Eric J Small', 'Joseph Blecha', 'Salma Jivan', 'Thomas A Hope', 'Jeffry P Simko', 'John Kurhanewicz', 'Susan M Noworolski', 'Natalie J Korn', 'Romelyn De Los Santos', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Hao G Nguyen', 'Kirsten L Greene', 'Beatrice Langton-Webster', 'Clifford E Berkman', 'Youngho Seo']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Assessment of an 18F-labeled phosphoramidate peptidomimetic as a new prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted imaging agent for prostate cancer.', '68GaGa-P16-093 as a PSMA-Targeted PET Radiopharmaceutical for Detection of Cancer: Initial Evaluation and Comparison with 68GaGa-PSMA-11 in Prostate Cancer Patients Presenting with Biochemical Recurrence.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen PET: Clinical Utility in Prostate Cancer, Normal Patterns, Pearls, and Pitfalls.', 'Current application and future perspectives of prostate specific membrane antigen PET imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Modular Smart Molecules for PSMA-Targeted Chemotherapy.', 'The future of PSMA PET and WB MRI as next-generation imaging tools in prostate cancer.', 'Advances in PSMA theranostics.', 'Synthesis, preclinical evaluation, and first-in-human study of Al18F-PSMA-Q for prostate cancer imaging.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted theranostics: past, present, and future approaches.']"""

Methods:   In a Seattle-based cohort of patients diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer and prospective follow-up for outcomes (n = 1,354), we studied the association between self-reported vigorous physical activity and prostate cancer progression to a metastatic-lethal phenotype. A subset of patients had prostate cancer tissue samples available for investigating DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array) and exercise (n = 524).  Results:   Patients who had vigorous physical activity at least once per week during the year before diagnosis (∼79% of the cohort) were significantly less likely to progress to metastatic-lethal prostate cancer compared with those who had vigorous physical activity less frequently (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.63; P = 0.029). Among the subset of men who had radical prostatectomy as primary treatment and tumor tissue available, a differentially methylated region (DMR) was identified (family-wise error rate = 0.03, hypomethylated in the weekly exercise group), with 9 methylation probes located in the promoter region of CRACR2A. This gene encodes a calcium binding protein involved in innate immune response. The methylation level of the nine CpGs was inversely correlated with CRACR2A gene expression (average correlation coefficient = -0.35).  Conclusions:   Vigorous physical activity before diagnosis is associated with epigenetic alterations of CRACR2A and prostate cancer metastatic-lethal progression.

Intervention-based studies are valuable to inform the most appropriate and effective support for caregivers. Barriers in the recruitment of patient/caregiver dyads exist but the reasons for non-participation are less well understood. This analysis determined the factors associated with participation in a randomized controlled trial involving patient/caregiver dyads, reasons for non-participation and factors associated with these reasons.  Methods:   Patients with any type of cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer), and their caregiver were recruited at four Australian health services. Eligible patients were invited to participate together with their caregiver (N = 737). Non-participation data were collected from non-participants. Bivariate and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine factors associated with participation.  Results:   Of the 737 eligible dyads, 521 (71%) declined participation. Dyad characteristics associated with participation were caregiver gender, patient treatment modality and hospital type. The odds for participating were almost two times greater for female than male caregivers (p = 0.005); 13 times greater for patients receiving chemoradiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone (p < 0.001); and three times greater for dyads attending a private versus public hospital (p < 0.001). Reasons for non-participation were lack of interest (33%), lack of time (29%), not requiring support (23%), too burdensome (15%); factors significantly associated with these reasons were treatment modality, patient age, cancer type, and hospital type. Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and receiving chemotherapy alone were less likely to decline due to a lack of interest. Patients more likely to decline due to lack of time were those aged 40-59 years and receiving chemotherapy alone. Patients who were more likely to decline because they felt participation was too burdensome were those attending a private hospital for treatment.

Because of the known protective effect of grape seed extract (GSE) against prostate cancer, we evaluated the effects of grape powder extract (GPE) on cell viability, proliferation, and metastatic capability. Importantly, we explored the possible novel mechanism of GPE through metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) downregulation in prostate cancer, since our previous studies indicated resveratrol (Res)- and pterostilbene (Pter)-induced MTA1-mediated anticancer activities in prostate cancer. We found that GPE inhibited the cell viability and growth of prostate cancer cells only at high 100 μg/mL concentrations. However, at low 1.5⁻15 μg/mL concentrations, GPE significantly reduced the colony formation and wound healing capabilities of both DU145 and PC3M cells. Moreover, we found that GPE inhibited MTA1 in a dose-dependent manner in these cells, albeit with considerably less potency than Res and Pter. These results indicate that stilbenes such as Res and Pter specifically and potently inhibit MTA1 and MTA1-associated proteins compared to GPE, which contains low concentrations of Res and mainly consists of other flavonoids and anthocyanidins. Our findings support continued interest in GPE as a chemopreventive and anti-cancer agent against prostate cancer but also emphasize the unique and specific properties of stilbenes on MTA1-mediated anticancer effects on prostate cancer.""","""['Avinash Kumar', ""Melinee D'silva"", 'Kshiti Dholakia', 'Anait S Levenson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nutrients""","""['Targeting MTA1/HIF-1α signaling by pterostilbene in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitor attenuates prostate cancer progression.', 'MTA1-Dependent Anticancer Activity of Gnetin C in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pterostilbene acts through metastasis-associated protein 1 to inhibit tumor growth, progression and metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Metastasis-associated protein 1-mediated antitumor and anticancer activity of dietary stilbenes for prostate cancer chemoprevention and therapy.', 'Dietary stilbenes as modulators of specific miRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Incorporation of grape seed extract towards wound care product development.', 'Grapevine as a Rich Source of Polyphenolic Compounds.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Gnetin C in Prostate Cancer: A Pre-Clinical Study.', 'Grape (Vitis vinifera L.)

However, clinical outcome data of patients who developed an SSC after HSCT are limited.  Objective:   To assess the outcome of patients with an SSC occurring after HSCT from the time of SSC diagnosis.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study used data of 4065 patients from 26 countries registered with the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, which has maintained clinical data since 1977 of patients who received a transplant. Information from all patients who underwent a transplant in Europe and had an SSC diagnosis between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2014, was extracted. The cohort included patients with 18 different cancers. Data analysis was conducted from September 3, 2017, to March 17, 2018.  Main outcomes and measures:   Median and 5-year age-standardized overall survival, causes of death, risk factor multivariate analysis using a clustered Cox proportional hazard regression model, and standardized mortality ratio were calculated for each of the 18 types of SSC.  Results:   In total, 220 617 patients underwent a transplant, of whom only 4065 (1.8%) patients with a second solid cancer after HSCT were included in the study. Among the 4065 patients, 2321 (57.1%) were men and 1744 (42.9%) were women, with a mean (range) age of 59.1 (3.2-82.3) years at diagnosis of second solid cancer. The 5-year age-standardized overall survival was 47% (95% CI, 45%-49%). The 5-year overall survival rate after SSC diagnosis was poor for pancreas, lung, hepatobiliary, esophageal, brain, and gastric cancers, with a median survival between 0.6 and 1 year. The 5-year overall survival was intermediate for endometrial, colorectal, sarcomas, ovarian, bladder, oropharyngeal, and kidney cancers, with a median survival between 2 and 10 years. The 5-year overall survival was more favorable for melanoma, breast, prostate, cervix, and thyroid cancers, with a median survival of 10 or more years. Additional transplant-associated factors for mortality for patients treated with allogeneic HSCT were age at transplant, donor type, conditioning regimen, and graft-vs-host disease. In total, 1777 patients (43.7%) died, of which 1256 (74.8%) were from SSC, 344 (20.5%) from primary disease, and 79 (4.7%) from other causes. Standardized mortality ratio was higher, compared with de novo solid cancers, for melanoma, prostate, breast, kidney, bladder, colorectal, and endometrial cancers but not for the other cancers.  Conclusions and relevance:   The outcome of SSC is mainly dependent on the type of second cancer; thus, future studies should investigate the reasons the standardized mortality ratio is higher for some cancers to identify whether patients with these cancers should be treated differently and to help in screening and counseling patients who developed an SSC after HSCT.""","""['André Tichelli', 'Eric Beohou', 'Myriam Labopin', 'Gérard Socié', 'Alicia Rovó', 'Manuela Badoglio', 'Anja van Biezen', 'Peter Bader', 'Rafael F Duarte', 'Grzegorz Basak', 'Nina Salooja;Transplant Complications Working Party of the EBMT']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Guidelines for Secondary Solid Cancers Among HSCT Recipients-In Reply.', 'Guidelines for Secondary Solid Cancers Among HSCT Recipients.', 'Second cancers and late mortality in Australian children treated by allogeneic HSCT for haematological malignancy.', 'Skin Cancer Risk in Hematopoietic Stem-Cell Transplant Recipients Compared With Background Population and Renal Transplant Recipients: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Bone marrow versus peripheral blood allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation for haematological malignancies in adults.', 'Polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulins for the prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplantation in adults.', 'Risk of Secondary Malignancies in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Recipients: A Nationwide Population-Based Study in Taiwan.', 'Outcomes of patients with esophageal cancer after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.', 'Outcomes of subsequent neoplasms after umbilical cord blood transplantation in Europe.', 'Retrospective, Landmark Analysis of Long-term Adult Morbidity Following Allogeneic HSCT for Inborn Errors of Immunity in Infancy and Childhood.', 'Male-specific late effects in adult hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients: a systematic review from the Late Effects and Quality of Life Working Committee of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research and Transplant Complications Working Party of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation.']"""

Choosing well-registered atlases for label fusion is vital for an accurate segmentation. This choice becomes even more crucial when the segmentation involves organs characterized by a high anatomical and pathological variability. In this paper, we propose a new genetic atlas selection strategy (GAS) that automatically chooses the best subset of atlases to be used for segmenting the target image, on the basis of both image similarity and segmentation overlap. More precisely, the key idea of GAS is that if two images are similar, the performances of an atlas for segmenting each image are similar. Since the ground truth of each atlas is known, GAS first selects a predefined number of similar images to the target, then, for each one of them, finds a near-optimal subset of atlases by means of a genetic algorithm. All these near-optimal subsets are then combined and used to segment the target image. GAS was tested on single-label and multi-label segmentation problems. In the first case, we considered the segmentation of both the whole prostate and of the left ventricle of the heart from magnetic resonance images. Regarding multi-label problems, the zonal segmentation of the prostate into peripheral and transition zone was considered. The results showed that the performance of MAS algorithms statistically improved when GAS is used.""","""['Michela Antonelli', 'M Jorge Cardoso', 'Edward W Johnston', 'Mrishta Brizmohun Appayya', 'Benoit Presles', 'Marc Modat', 'Shonit Punwani', 'Sebastien Ourselin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Adaptive local multi-atlas segmentation: application to the heart and the caudate nucleus.', 'A unified framework for cross-modality multi-atlas segmentation of brain MRI.', 'Volume measurements of individual muscles in human quadriceps femoris using atlas-based segmentation approaches.', 'Multi-atlas segmentation of biomedical images: A survey.', 'Multi-atlas image registration of clinical data with automated quality assessment using ventricle segmentation.', 'Automated landmarking via multiple templates.', 'Semi-Automatic Prostate Segmentation From Ultrasound Images Using Machine Learning and Principal Curve Based on Interpretable Mathematical Model Expression.', 'Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Disease in Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based on the Harris Hawks Optimization Algorithm.', 'AutoProstate: Towards Automated Reporting of Prostate MRI for Prostate Cancer Assessment Using Deep Learning.', 'SOMA: Subject-, object-, and modality-adapted precision atlas approach for automatic anatomy recognition and delineation in medical images.']"""

Objective:   On the basis of the principle that multiple bioactives in tomato and soy may act on diverse anticancer pathways, we developed and characterized a tomato-soy juice for clinical trials. In this phase 2 dose-escalating study, we examined plasma, prostate, and urine biomarkers of carotenoid and isoflavone exposure.  Methods:   Men scheduled for prostatectomy were recruited to consume 0, 1, or 2 cans of tomato-soy juice/d before surgery (mean ± SD duration: 24 ± 4.6 d). The juice provided 20.6 mg lycopene and 66 mg isoflavone aglycone equivalents/177-mL can. Plasma carotenoids and urinary isoflavone metabolites were quantified by HPLC-photometric diode array and prostate carotenoids and isoflavones by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry.  Results:   We documented significant dose-response increases (P < 0.05) in plasma concentrations of tomato carotenoids. Plasma concentrations were 1.86-, 1.69-, 1.73-, and 1.69-fold higher for lycopene, β-carotene, phytoene, and phytofluene, respectively, for the 1-can/d group and 2.34-, 3.43-, 2.54-, and 2.29-fold higher, respectively, for the 2-cans/d group compared with 0 cans/d. Urinary isoflavones daidzein, genistein, and glycitein increased in a dose-dependent manner. Prostate carotenoid and isoflavone concentrations were not dose-dependent in this short intervention; yet, correlations between plasma carotenoid and urinary isoflavones with respective prostate concentrations were documented (R2 = 0.78 for lycopene, P < 0.001; R2 = 0.59 for dihydrodaidzein, P < 0.001). Secondary clustering analyses showed urinary isoflavone metabolite phenotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the phytoene and phytofluene in prostate tissue after a dietary intervention. Secondary analysis showed that the 2-cans/d group experienced a nonsignificant decrease in prostate-specific antigen slope compared with 0 cans/d (P = 0.078).

Assessment:   Microscopes, quantitative and qualitative analyzing instruments, and clinical devices were used for assessing this novel contrast agent and its diagnosis effects.  Statistical tests:   We used linear regression analyses to determine the longitudinal relaxivity (r1 ) values of our US/T1 -MRI contrast agent and gadobutrol.  Results:   Microbubble+Fe3+ melanin nanoparticle+peptides (MB+Fe3+ MNPPs) had a good US contrast effect, like a commercial US agent. The differences of US intensities between them was below 5%.

However, the seminal vesicles are known to express prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and it is unknown whether SVRP influences oncological outcome measured with ultrasensitive PSA immunoassays. In a retrospective study we analysed whether SVRP affects oncological outcome in terms of ultrasensitive PSA nadir and biochemical recurrence as compared with standard robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (sRALP). METHODS Overall, 102 patients underwent robotic prostatectomy. Patients were non-randomly allocated to the following surgical techniques: a SVRP group of 39 patients who underwent robotic radical prostatectomy sparing the tips of the seminal vesicles; a standard group of 63 patients who were treated with sRALP. Inclusion criteria were histologically proven negative margins (R0) and negative lymph node status (pN0). PSA was measured with an ultrasensitive assay. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the differences in PSA nadir and follow-up PSA. Biochemical recurrence was diagnosed if PSA rose to ≥0.2 mg/ml. RESULTS Median (range) follow-up was 31.4 (16.4–43.8) months. Preoperative PSA was 5.8 (0.13–15.29) ng/ml in the SVRP group and 7.1 (0.8–46) ng/ml in the sRALP group. Two cases of biochemical recurrence occurred in the sRALP group during follow-up. One of these two patients presented with locally advanced prostate carcinoma diagnosed from the definitive pathological specimen (pT3b). No patient of the SVRP group had seminal vesicle invasion or biochemical recurrence. No significant between-group difference in terms of PSA nadir and follow-up PSA was recorded. However, the percentage of patients who did not reach PSA nadir values of <0.01 ng/ml was higher in the SVRP group (10 vs 5% in the sRALP group). CONCLUSIONS Compared with sRALP, SVRP had no clinical impact on oncological outcome in terms of PSA nadir or biochemical recurrence measured with an ultrasensitive PSA immunoassay. A slightly higher PSA nadir after SVRP seems to be expected, which needs to be mentioned during follow-up of these patients.""","""['Orlando Burkhardt', 'Julia Esther Neuenschwander', 'Hubert John', 'Marco Randazzo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Swiss Med Wkly""","""['Seminal vesicle sparing robotic radical prostatectomy - no different interpretation of postoperative PSA follow-up required?', 'Usefulness of the nadir value of serum prostate-specific antigen measured by an ultrasensitive assay as a predictor of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'The effect of seminal vesicle-sparing radical prostatectomy on serum prostate-specific antigen level.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Current role of salvage robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'A brief review of ultrasensitive prostate-specific antigen assays for the evaluation of patients after radical prostatectomy.']"""

Methods:   Cancerous tissue samples from RP specimens were excised by a uropathologist. Preparation of 3D spheroids was done by mechanical disintegration and limited enzymatic digestion followed by serial filtration through 100 μm- and 40 μm-cell strainers. Thereafter, spheroids were cultured in a modified stem cell medium and characterized by a live/dead assay, whole-spheroid immunohistochemistry (IHC; CK5, CK8, AMACR, PSA, Ki67, AR, αSMA, Vimentin, E-Cadherin) and PSA-measurements in culture medium. Furthermore, their response to pharmaceutical treatment with docetaxel, bicalutamide, enzalutamide and abiraterone was tested.  Results:   173 RP cases were included. The median preoperative PSA-level was 16.12 ng/ml [range 0.99;345], the median Gleason score was 7b [6;10]. 64 cases were excluded due to low tumor content in frozen sections (43) or to insufficient spheroid formation (21). In the remaining 109 cases, spheroids formed successfully and stayed viable for up to several months. IHC analysis revealed AR-, CK8-, and AMACR-positivity in nearly all cases, while CK5-positive cells were detectable only occasionally as were α-SMA and Vimentin. E-Cadherin was positive in most cases. Furthermore, spheroids proved to be amenable to cryopreservation. While abiraterone had no effect and docetaxel only a moderate effect, spheroid viability was markedly reduced upon bicalutamide and enzalutamide treatment.  Conclusions:   Multicellular 3D spheroids can be generated from patient-derived RP tissue samples and serve as an innovative in vitro model of organ-confined PCa.""","""['Johannes Linxweiler', 'Markus Hammer', 'Stefanie Muhs', 'Moritz Kohn', 'Alexej Pryalukhin', 'Christian Veith', 'Rainer M Bohle', 'Michael Stöckle', 'Kerstin Junker', 'Matthias Saar']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['A novel mouse model of human prostate cancer to study intraprostatic tumor growth and the development of lymph node metastases.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Modify the Response of Prostate Cancer Cells to Androgen and Anti-Androgens in Three-Dimensional Spheroid Culture.', 'Biological behavior of prostate cancer cells in 3D culture systems.', 'Neoadjuvant docetaxel treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer: a clinicopathologic study.', 'Recent advances in three-dimensional multicellular spheroid culture for biomedical research.', 'Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement of Animal Experiments in Anticancer Drug Development: The Contribution of 3D In Vitro Cancer Models in the Drug Efficacy Assessment.', 'Functional precision oncology using patient-derived assays: bridging genotype and phenotype.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.', 'Preclinical and Clinical Research Models of Prostate Cancer: A Brief Overview.', 'Integrated analysis of the tumor microenvironment using a reconfigurable microfluidic cell culture platform.']"""

We aimed to assess the outcome and safety of rechallenge PSMA-RLT in patients with progressive prostatic cancer who previously benefited from this therapy.  Materials and methods:   Patients who received rechallenge therapy at our department from January 2015 to March 2018 were assessed. Non-haematological and haematological adverse events were evaluated from laboratory data and clinical reports and were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v. 5.0). Time to prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) progression and the overall survival (OS) rate of the study patients were calculated from the date of the first rechallenge cycle. Furthermore, the OS calculated from the first cycle baseline PSMA-RLT was compared with the survival of patients who received only baseline PSMA-RLT. The response data were determined using [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and measurements of the tumour marker PSA.  Results:   Included in this retrospective study were 30 patients who were initially treated with a median of 3 cycles (range 1-5) of PSMA-RLT and were eventually retreated after a median of 6 months (range 2-26). Each patient received a median of 3 (range 1-6) rechallenge cycles. None of the patients experienced a disabling or life-threatening grade 4 adverse event according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). Grade 3 toxicity occurred in 8 patients (27%). Serious adverse events included leucopoenia (n = 2), neutropoenia (n = 1), anaemia (n = 4), thrombopenia (n = 4) and elevated renal parameters (n = 1). Irreversible adverse events occurred in 21 patients (70%). The permanent adverse events were mild/moderate (CTC grade 1/2) in 19 patients and serious (CTC grade 3) in two patients, respectively. According to PSA measurements, 75-90% of patients showed a benefit (response/stable) from the first 4 rechallenge cycles. The median OS was 12 months calculated from the first rechallenge cycle and 25 months calculated from the first cycle baseline PSMA-RLT. For comparison, the median OS in patients who received only baseline PSMA-RLT was 9 months. The difference according to the logrank test was significant: p value <0.001. Patients with a PSA decrease after the first cycle of rechallenge PSMA-RLT survived a median of 19 months, while patients with a PSA increase survived only 6 months.  Conclusion:   Rechallenge prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) therapy has an acceptable safety profile. The majority of the retreated patients benefited from the rechallenge therapy. Patients who showed a biochemical response achieved a longer OS compared to patients who did not respond. The median OS was significantly longer in patients after rechallenge PSMA-RLT than in patients who received only baseline PSMA-RLT.""","""['Anna Yordanova', 'Paula Linden', 'Stefan Hauser', 'Michael Meisenheimer', 'Stefan Kürpig', 'Georg Feldmann', 'Florian C Gaertner', 'Markus Essler', 'Hojjat Ahmadzadehfar']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Overall survival and response pattern of castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer to multiple cycles of radioligand therapy using 177LuLu-PSMA-617.', 'A Single-Arm, Low-Dose, Prospective Study of 177Lu-EB-PSMA Radioligand Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Therapeutic efficacy, prognostic variables and clinical outcome of 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT in progressive mCRPC following multiple lines of treatment: prognostic implications of high FDG uptake on dual tracer PET-CT vis-à-vis Gleason score in such cohort.', '177Lu-PSMA therapy : Current evidence for use in the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'PSMA radioligand therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Joint EANM/SNMMI procedure guideline for the use of 177Lu-labeled PSMA-targeted radioligand-therapy (177Lu-PSMA-RLT).', 'The ""Ins and Outs"" of Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) as Specific Target in Prostate Cancer Therapy.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 theranostic probe for hepatocellular carcinoma imaging and therapy.', '177Lu-PSMA Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Mini-Review of State-of-the-Art.', 'A Review of 177Lutetium-PSMA and 225Actinium-PSMA as Emerging Theranostic Agents in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Twenty-three matched pairs of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were selected from a pool of prostate cancer patients. All MR scans were preprocessed to reduce scanner- and patient-induced intensity inhomogeneities and to standardize their intensity histograms. Ten (training dataset) of 23 pairs were then utilized to construct the coregistered CT-MR atlas. The synthetic CT for a new patient is generated by appropriately weighting the deformed atlas of CT-MR onto the new patient MRI. The training dataset was used as an atlas to generate the synthetic CT for the rest of the patients (test dataset). The mean absolute error (MAE) between the deformed planning CT and synthetic CT was computed over the entire CT image, bone, fat, and muscle tissues. The original treatment plans were also recomputed on the new synthetic CTs and dose-volume histogram metrics were compared. The results were compared with a commercially available synthetic CT Software (MRCAT) that is routinely used in our clinic.  Results:   MAE errors (±SD) between the deformed planning CT and our proposed synthetic CTs in the test dataset were 47 ± 5, 116 ± 12, 36 ± 6, and 47 ± 5 HU for the entire image, bone, fat, and muscle tissues respectively. The MAEs were 65 ± 5, 172 ± 9, 43 ± 7, and 42 ± 4 HU for the corresponding tissues in MRCAT CT. The dosimetric comparison showed consistent results for all plans using our synthetic CT, deformed planning CT and MRCAT CT.

The objective of this study is to report our clinical experience with RLT using 177-lutetium-labeled PSMA-I&T. A total of 100 patients were treated under a compassionate use protocol with a total number of 319 cycles (median two cycles, range 1-6). Eligibility criteria included previous treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, previous taxane-based chemotherapy or chemoineligibility, and positive PSMA-ligand uptake at positron-emission tomography scan. The 177Lu-PSMA-I&T was given 6-8 weekly with an activity of 7.4 GBq up to six cycles. The median number of previous mCRPC regimens was 3 (range 1-6), and 35 patients had visceral metastases. Prostate-specific antigen decline of ≥50% was achieved in 38 patients, median clinical progression-free survival (cPFS) was 4.1mo, and median overall survival (OS) was 12.9mo. Subgroup analyses identified an association of visceral metastases with a poor prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and shorter cPFS and OS, and an association of rising lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with shorter cPFS and OS. Patients achieving PSA decline of ≥50% within 12wk of treatment showed longer cPFS and OS. Treatment-emergent hematologic grade 3/4 toxicities were anemia (9%), thrombocytopenia (4%), and neutropenia (6%). Grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities were not observed. RLT with 177Lu-PSMA-I&T showed good activity in more than one-third of patients with late-stage mCRPC at low toxicity. Presence of visceral metastases and rising LDH were associated with worse treatment outcome. PATIENT SUMMARY: We analyzed the treatment outcome and toxicity of prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted radioligand therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We found that a good treatment response could be achieved in a subgroup of patients with few side effects.

Methods:   A qualitative research design through semi-structured interviews with 22 older men with prostate cancer was conducted in two areas of the Netherlands in 2015. Patients were selected through systematic non-probabilistic sampling. The transcripts were analysed with conventional content analysis and affinity diagramming.  Results:   Four themes emerged from the data: impact of prostate cancer, dealing with prostate cancer and treatment, involvement of and with others, and experiences with professional care and the care trajectory. The way patients dealt with prostate cancer and their experiences with the care they received varied. Overall, hospital care was rated positively, and communication was a crucial determinant of the patient's satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Some patients lacked information about their health status, which may have influenced decision-making processes. Some were reluctant to talk about their disease with other people and sometimes hesitated to ask for help.  Conclusion:   Despite many positive care experiences, some patients felt that the communication, information provision and decision-making were inadequate. Vulnerable patients with severe complications or limited social support may need additional psychosocial care. Lowering the threshold for patients to ask for help and the availability of a professional with expert knowledge about prostate cancer and ageing may decrease unnecessary hardship and increase personal strengths.""","""['I B van Ee', 'M Hagedoorn', 'C H M Smits', 'A M Kamper', 'H A Honkoop', 'J P J Slaets']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Oncol Nurs""","""[""Prostate cancer support groups, health literacy and consumerism: are community-based volunteers re-defining older men's health?"", ""Men's perception of information and descriptions of emotional strain in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer-a qualitative individual interview study."", 'Development and evaluation of a support program for prostate cancer survivors in Alaska.', ""Men's experiences of antenatal screening: a metasynthesis of the qualitative research."", ""Prostate cancer and supportive care: a systematic review and qualitative synthesis of men's experiences and unmet needs."", ""Factors that influence older patients' participation in clinical communication within developed country hospitals and GP clinics: A systematic review of current literature."", 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.', 'Identification of piRNA Targets in Urinary Extracellular Vesicles for the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer after hospital discharge: multi-stakeholder perspectives.']"""

Methods:   The longitudinal study design consisted of 179 patients and 166 spouses, using discretionary sampling, at five Finnish central hospitals. Participants completed a self-reported RAND-36-Item Health Survey at three time-points: time of diagnosis and 6 and 12 months later.

Thus, this study explored positive and negative affect and prostate cancer-specific anxiety as well as their associated factors in prostate cancer patients and their partners.  Method:   A prospective repeated-measures design was used. Data were collected from 48 prostate cancer patients and their partners when treatment was determined (before treatment) and at 6, 10, 18, and 24 weeks thereafter. The questionnaire included the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and the Memorial Anxiety Scale for prostate cancer. Generalized estimating equations were used for statistical analysis.  Results:   Patients with lower relationship satisfaction experienced lower positive affect (β = 0.279) and higher negative affect (β = -0.323), and their partners experienced higher prostate specific antigen-related anxiety (β = -0.014). The presence of strong hormonal symptoms aggravated negative affect (β = -0.010) and prostate cancer-related anxiety (β = -0.009), but living with children and grandchildren improved prostate cancer-related anxiety (β = -0.445) and fear of cancer recurrence in patients (β = -0.232).  Conclusions:   There is an interaction between the prostate cancer-specific anxiety experienced by patients and that experienced by their partners. The emotional state of patients and their partners should be evaluated, and understandable information should be provided. Care strategies should include encouraging adult children to participate in the patients' care plan, symptom management, and the teaching of coping skills.""","""['Ching-Hui Chien', 'Cheng-Keng Chuang', 'Kuan-Lin Liu', 'Chun-Te Wu', 'See-Tong Pang', 'Ying-Hsu Chang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Oncol Nurs""","""['Prostate cancer-specific anxiety and the resulting health-related quality of life in couples.', 'Cross-sectional relationships between dyadic coping and anxiety, depression, and relationship satisfaction for patients with prostate cancer and their spouses.', 'Effects of individual and partner factors on anxiety and depression in Taiwanese prostate cancer patients: A longitudinal study.', 'Coping with prostate cancer: a meta-analytic review.', 'Including partners into the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a review of the literature to provide a model of care.', 'Do alexithymia and negative affect predict poor sleep quality?

Current solid phantoms require a separate user-implemented setup using a container with liquid medium to evaluate the alignment between the needle template and the electronic grid, a test of geometric accuracy with critical implications in dosimetric quality. Utilizing a 3D printer, we constructed a cost-effective, liquid-based phantom that provides a complete TG128 solution which improves the efficiency of brachytherapy ultrasound QA.  Methods:   The TG128 report was used to guide the design process of the liquid-based phantom. The needle template and electronic grid alignment setup served as the foundation with specific components developed to integrate all remaining tests. Water was chosen as the liquid medium, with speed of sound adjusted to 1,540 m/s via salinity per the task group recommendations. The proof of concept was evaluated by comparing the time stamps labeled on QA images between the liquid-based phantom and a commercially available one for both a new and experienced user.  Results:   A TG128 QA trial run demonstrated that all recommended tests can be completed with the single phantom setup. Evaluation of the time data revealed a total QA duration of 45 min (average of two trials) with the liquid-based phantom, compared to 70 and 90 min with the commercial phantom for a new and experienced user.  Conclusions:   The liquid-based phantom is specifically designed to satisfy the recommendations of the TG128 report. The incorporation of 3D printing allows simple design modifications to adapt the phantom on-the-fly if needed. The resulting product improves the efficiency of brachytherapy ultrasound QA by eliminating the need for multiple phantom setups.""","""['Brian Leong', 'Mark Ostyn', 'Seungjong Oh', 'Siyong Kim']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['AAPM Task Group 128: quality assurance tests for prostate brachytherapy ultrasound systems.', 'A simple technique for alignment of perineal needle template to ultrasound image grid for permanent prostate implants.', 'Computing intraoperative dosimetry for prostate brachytherapy using TRUS and fluoroscopy.', 'A review of the recommendations governing quality assurance of ultrasound systems used for guidance in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Quality assurance needs for modern image-based radiotherapy: recommendations from 2007 interorganizational symposium on ""quality assurance of radiation therapy: challenges of advanced technology"".', 'A review of brachytherapy physical phantoms developed over the last 20 years: clinical purpose and future requirements.']"""

TNKS is stabilized by the ubiquitin-specific protease 25 (USP25). The effect of disruption of the interaction between TNKS and USP25 by small molecules on prostate cancer proliferation is unknown. In this study we conducted a hierarchical virtual screening with more than 200,000 compounds on the characterized structures of the USP25/TNKS-ARC5 protein complex. In silico analysis and in vitro validation revealed that a small molecule, called C44, binds to the protein-protein interaction (PPI) interface of TNKS and USP25. We show that C44 disrupts the interaction between TNKS and USP25 leading to a higher half-life of AXIN and the breakdown of <beta>-catenin protein. We also show that the selective inhibition of the TNKS-USP25 interaction by C44 significantly reduces proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our study reveals a new PPI inhibitor that lowers the stability of TNKS protein and inhibits Wnt pathway signaling.

We aimed to validate the updated AJCC stage groups for PCa using a radical prostatectomy (RP) cohort.  Patients and methods:   We analyzed the data of 3032 patients previously treated with RP for localized PCa. We stratified patients into stage groups according to the 8th edition of the AJCC manual and compared biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival using Kaplan-Meier analyses.  Results:   There were 217 patients in stage group I, 33 in IIA, 1101 in IIB, 535 in IIC, 129 in IIIA, 781 in IIIB, and 236 in IIIC. There were no significant differences in BCR-free survival between stage groups IIC and IIIA (P = .875). Subsequently, the low-Gleason score (GS) IIIA subgroup (GS ≤ 3 + 4, P = .025) showed superior BCR-free survival than the IIC group, and the high-GS IIIA subgroups (GS ≥ 4 + 3, P = .004) showed a poorer BCR-free survival than the IIC group. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between groups I and IIA (P = 330) and between groups IIA and IIB (P = .942). Our new staging system provided a better ability to discriminate the prognosis of each group. However, our study has several limitations, such as retrospective design, relatively short follow-up period, and need for further validation.  Conclusion:   The current AJCC prognostic groups show some contradictory results, particularly concerning prognosis of the IIC and IIIA groups. We suggest that GS be given more weight than serum prostate-specific antigen level in stage group stratification.""","""['Hakmin Lee', 'Minseung Lee', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Sang Eun Lee', 'Sung Kyu Hong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Predictive value of the UICC and AJCC 8th edition tumor-nodes-metastasis (TNM) classification for patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Independent Validation of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th Edition Prostate Cancer Staging Classification.', 'Prognostic value of subclassification (pT2 stage) of pathologically organ-confined prostate cancer: Confirmation of the changes introduced in the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.', 'Updates in the Eighth Edition of the Tumor-Node-Metastasis Staging Classification for Urologic Cancers.', 'Evolution in Prostate Cancer Staging: Pathology Updates From AJCC 8th Edition and Opportunities That Remain.', 'KIF11: A potential prognostic biomarker for predicting bone metastasis-free survival of prostate cancer.', 'Deciphering the structure, function, expression and regulation of aquaporin-5 in cancer evolution.', 'Knockdown of long non‑coding RNA CCAT2 suppresses the progression of thyroid cancer by inhibiting the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway.', 'Stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 is a histological marker reflecting the malignant behavior of prostate cancer.']"""

Using such plans for validating a DVH prediction algorithm might obscure its intrinsic prediction accuracy. In this study we used a recently published large database of Pareto-optimal prostate cancer plans to assess the prediction accuracy of a commercial knowledge-based DVH prediction algorithm, RapidPlan. The database plans were consistently generated with automated planning using an independent optimizer, and can be considered as aground truth of plan quality.  Methods:   Prediction models were generated using training sets with 20, 30, 45, 55 and 114 Pareto-optimal plans. Model-20 and Model-30 were built using 5 groups of randomly selected training patients. For 60 independent Pareto-optimal validation plans, predicted and database DVHs were compared.  Results:   For model-114, differences between predicted and database mean doses of more than ± 10% in rectum, anus and bladder, occurred for 23.3%, 55.0%, and 6.7% of the validation plans, respectively. For rectum V65Gy and V75Gy, differences outside the ±10% range were observed in 21.7% and 70.0% of validation plans, respectively. For 61.7% of validation plans, inaccuracies in predicted rectum DVHs resulted in a deviation in predicted NTCP for rectal bleeding outside ±10%. With smaller training sets the DVH prediction performance deteriorated, showing dependence on the selected training patients.  Conclusion:   Even when analysed with Pareto-optimal plans with highly consistent quality, clinically relevant deviations in DVH predictions were observed. Such deviations could potentially result in suboptimal plans for new patients.

We used observational data on 2,299 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from 1998 to 2010 and were free of conditions that might have precluded participation at baseline (first postdiagnostic questionnaire). We estimated their survival under several guideline-based physical activity interventions starting at baseline and ending at the development of conditions limiting physical ability. We adjusted for baseline and time-varying risk factors for death using the parametric g-formula.

However, restoration of PTEN or inhibition of the activated PI3K/AKT pathway has shown limited success, prompting us to identify obligate targets for disease intervention. We hypothesized that PTEN loss might expose cells to unique epigenetic vulnerabilities. Here, we identified a synthetic lethal relationship between PTEN and Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), an ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Higher BRG1 expression in tumors with low PTEN expression was associated with a worse clinical outcome. Genetically engineered mice (GEMs) and organoid assays confirmed that ablation of PTEN sensitized the cells to BRG1 depletion. Mechanistically, PTEN loss stabilized BRG1 protein through the inhibition of the AKT/GSK3β/FBXW7 axis. Increased BRG1 expression in PTEN-deficient PCa cells led to chromatin remodeling into configurations that drove a protumorigenic transcriptome, causing cells to become further addicted to BRG1. Furthermore, we showed in preclinical models that BRG1 antagonist selectively inhibited the progression of PTEN-deficient prostate tumors.

From this, we aim to define a class of treatment techniques with invariant anisotropy distribution carrying information of target coverage and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The anisotropy presumably is a helpful quantity for plan adaptation problems.  Methods:   The anisotropy field is analyzed for different intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) techniques for a total of ten planning CTs of prostate cases. Primary irradiation directions ranged from 5 to 15. The uniqueness of anisotropy was explored: In particular, the anisotropy distribution inside the planning treatment volume (PTV) and in its vicinity was investigated. Furthermore, deviations of the anisotropy under beam rotations were explored by direct plan comparison as an indicating the susceptibility of each planned technique to changes in the geometric plan configuration. In addition, plan comparisons enabled the categorization of treatment techniques in terms of their anisotropy distribution.  Results:   The anisotropy profile inside the PTV and in the transition between OAR and PTV is independent of the treatment technique as long as a sufficient number of beams contribute to the dose distribution. Techniques with multiple beams constitute a class of almost identical and technique-independent anisotropy distribution. For this class of techniques, substructures of the anisotropy are particularly pronounced in the PTV, thus offering good options for applying adaptation rules. Additionally, the techniques forming the mentioned class fortunately allow a better OAR sparing at constant PTV coverage. Besides the characterization of the distribution, a pairwise plan comparison reveals each technique's susceptibility to deviations which decreases for an increasing number of primary irradiation directions.  Conclusions:   Techniques using many irradiation directions form a class of almost identical anisotropy distributions which are assumed to provide a basis for improved adaptation procedures. Encouragingly, these techniques deliver quite invariant anisotropy distributions with respect to rotations correlated with good plan qualities than techniques using few gantry angles. The following will be the next steps toward anisotropy-based adaptation: first, the quantification of anisotropy regarding organ deformations; and second, establishing the interrelation between the anisotropy and beam shaping.""","""['Johannes Greber', 'Bülent Polat', 'Michael Flentje', 'Klaus Bratengeier']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Anisotropy of dose contributions-An instrument to upgrade real time IMRT and VMAT adaptation?', 'Characteristics of non-coplanar IMRT in the presence of target-embedded organs at risk.', 'Left breast irradiation with tangential intensity modulated radiotherapy (t-IMRT) versus tangential volumetric modulated arc therapy (t-VMAT): trade-offs between secondary cancer induction risk and optimal target coverage.', 'Comparison of volumetric-modulated arc therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy prostate cancer plans accounting for cold spots.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.']"""

The present study reports the development of redox-sensitive dendrimersomes comprising disulfide-linked cholesterol-bearing PEGylated dendrimers, which can be used as drug and gene delivery systems. Two disulfide-linked cholesterol-bearing PEGylated generation 3 diaminobutyric polypropylenimine dendrimers have been successfully synthesized via an in situ two-step reaction. They were able to spontaneously self-assemble into stable, cationic, nanosized vesicles (or dendrimersomes) with lower critical aggregation concentration values for high-cholesterol-bearing vesicles. These dendrimersomes were able to entrap both hydrophilic and hydrophobic dyes, and they also showed a redox-responsive sustained release of the entrapped guests in the presence of a glutathione concentration similar to that of a cytosolic reducing environment. The high-cholesterol-bearing dendrimersomes were found to have a higher melting enthalpy, increased adsorption tendency on mica surface, entrapping ability for a larger amount of hydrophobic drugs, and increased resistance to redox-responsive environments in comparison with their low-cholesterol counterpart. In addition, both dendrimersomes were able to condense more than 85% of the DNA at all the tested ratios for the low-cholesterol vesicles, and at dendrimer : DNA weight ratios of 1 : 1 and higher for the high-cholesterol vesicles. These vesicles resulted in an enhanced cellular uptake of DNA, by up to 15-fold when compared with naked DNA with low-cholesterol vesicles. As a result, they increased the gene transfection on the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, with the highest transfection being obtained with low-cholesterol vesicle complexes at a dendrimer : DNA weight ratio of 5 : 1 and high-cholesterol vesicle complexes at a dendrimer : DNA weight ratio of 10 : 1. These transfection levels were about 5-fold higher than those observed when treated with naked DNA. These cholesterol-bearing PEGylated dendrimer-based vesicles are, therefore, promising as redox-sensitive drugs and gene delivery systems for potential applications in combination cancer therapies.""","""['Partha Laskar', 'Sukrut Somani', 'Najla Altwaijry', 'Margaret Mullin', 'Deborah Bowering', 'Monika Warzecha', 'Patricia Keating', 'Rothwelle J Tate', 'Hing Y Leung', 'Christine Dufès']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Octadecyl chain-bearing PEGylated poly(propyleneimine)-based dendrimersomes: physicochemical studies, redox-responsiveness, DNA condensation, cytotoxicity and gene delivery to cancer cells.', 'Camptothecin-based dendrimersomes for gene delivery and redox-responsive drug delivery to cancer cells.', 'Redox and pH dual responsive poly(amidoamine) dendrimer-poly(ethylene glycol) conjugates for intracellular delivery of doxorubicin.', 'PEGylated PAMAM dendrimers: Enhancing efficacy and mitigating toxicity for effective anticancer drug and gene delivery.', 'Emergence of cationic polyamine dendrimersomes: design, stimuli sensitivity and potential biomedical applications.', 'Glutathione-Responsive Tannic Acid-Assisted FRET Nanomedicine for Cancer Therapy.', 'Non-Viral Carriers for Nucleic Acids Delivery: Fundamentals and Current Applications.', 'Properties and Bioapplications of Amphiphilic Janus Dendrimers: A Review.', 'Natural steroid-based cationic copolymers cholesterol/diosgenin-r-PDMAEMAs and their pDNA nanoplexes: impact of steroid structures and hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratios on pDNA delivery.', 'Triazine-Carbosilane Dendrimersomes Enhance Cellular Uptake and Phototoxic Activity of Rose Bengal in Basal Cell Skin Carcinoma Cells.']"""

In addition, T-cells restricted to the adjacent stroma and benign areas are characterized by anergic and immunosuppressive phenotypes. In order for immunotherapies to produce robust anti-tumor responses in prostate cancer, this exclusion barrier and immunosuppressive microenvironment must first be overcome. We have previously identified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in primary and metastatic human prostate cancer tissue.  Methods:   An Opal Multiplex immunofluorescence assay based on CD73, CD90, and CD105 staining was used to identify triple-labeled MSCs in human prostate cancer tissue. T-cell suppression assays and flow cytometry were used to demonstrate the immunosuppressive potential of primary MSCs expanded from human bone marrow and prostate cancer tissue from independent donors.  Results:   Endogenous MSCs were confirmed to be present at sites of human prostate cancer. These prostate cancer-infiltrating MSCs suppress T-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner similar to their bone marrow-derived counterparts. Also similar to bone marrow-derived MSCs, prostate cancer-infiltrating MSCs upregulate expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on their cell surface in the presence of IFNγ and TNFα.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer-infiltrating MSCs suppress T-cell proliferation similar to canonical bone marrow-derived MSCs, which have well-documented immunosuppressive properties with numerous effects on both innate and adaptive immune system function. Thus, we hypothesize that selective depletion of MSCs infiltrating sites of prostate cancer should restore immunologic recognition and elimination of malignant cells via broad re-activation of cytotoxic pro-inflammatory pathways.""","""['Timothy E Krueger', 'Daniel L J Thorek', 'Alan K Meeker', 'John T Isaacs', 'W Nathaniel Brennen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['NLGP counterbalances the immunosuppressive effect of tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells to restore effector T cell functions.', 'Quantification of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) at sites of human prostate cancer.', 'Rapid selection of mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells in primary prostate stromal cultures.', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell: A Friend or Foe in Anti-Tumor Immunity.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells as a vector for the inflammatory prostate microenvironment.', 'Radiotherapy plus immune checkpoint inhibitor in prostate cancer.', 'Role of cancer-associated mesenchymal stem cells in the tumor microenvironment: A review.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell suppresses the efficacy of CAR-T toward killing lymphoma cells by modulating the microenvironment through stanniocalcin-1.', 'Molecular mechanisms of microRNA-216a during tumor progression.', 'MSCs can be a double-edged sword in tumorigenesis.']"""

The balance between degradation and stabilization of HIF-1α protein is determined by specific E3 ligases. In our search for new E3 ligases that might affect HIF-1α protein expression, we studied the effects of beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) on the hypoxic pathway in cancer cells. β-TrCP is overexpressed in many tumors and regulates various cellular processes through mediating the degradation of important targets. Unexpectedly, we found that β-TrCP overexpression increases HIF-1α protein expression level as well as HIF-1 transcriptional activity by stabilizing HIF-1α protein and preventing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in prostate cancer cells. By using a proteomic approach, we succeeded in demonstrating that β-TrCP interferes with the association between HIF-1α and HSP70/CHIP, a HIF-1α established E3 ligase complex. Whereas the E3 ligase activity of β-TrCP is well known, antagonizing another E3 ligase is a new mechanism of action of this important E3.

PSME contains multiple binding sites for Sox proteins, and in this study, we identified Sox7 protein as a negative regulator of PSMA expression through its interaction with PSME.  Methods:   The statistical correlation between Sox7 and PSMA mRNA expression was evaluated using five prostate cancer studies from cBioportal. In vitro and in vivo interaction between Sox7 and PSME was evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and luciferase reporter assay. Synthetic oligonucleotides were generated to define the sites in PSME that interact with Sox7 protein. Sox7 mutants were generated to identify the region of this protein required to regulate PSMA expression. Sox7 was also stably expressed in LNCaP/C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells to validate the regulation of PSMA expression by Sox7 in vivo.  Results:   Sox7 mRNA expression negatively correlated with PSMA/FOLH1 and PSMAL/FOLH1B mRNA expression in Broad/Cornell, TCGA and MSKCC studies, but not in two studies containing only metastatic prostate tumors. PC-3 cells mostly expressed the 48.5 KDa isoform 2 of Sox7, and the depletion of this isoform did not restore PSMA expression. Ectopic expression of canonical, wild-type Sox7 in C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells suppressed PSMA protein expression. ChIP assay revealed that canonical Sox7 protein preferentially interacts with PSME in vivo, and EMSA identified the SOX box sites #2 and #4 in PSME as required for its interaction. Sox7 was capable of directly binding to PSME and suppressed PSME-mediated transcription. The NLS regions of Sox7, but not its β-catenin interacting motif, are essential for this suppressing activity. Furthermore, restoration of wild-type Sox7 expression but not Sox7-NLS mutant in Sox7-null prostate cancer cell lines suppressed PSMA expression.

Since the superiority of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in detecting recurrent PCA is well established, the aim of our study was to assess its effect on management and outcome in all patients imaged during the first year after its introduction into clinical routine.  Methods:   Of 327 patients imaged, 223 were referred for recurrent PCA and gave written informed consent for further analysis of their data for this retrospective consecutive cohort analysis. Twenty patients were lost to further follow-up. The rate of detection of recurrence by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was based on the clinical reports. Management before the availability of PET diagnostic information was assessed according to guidelines (therapy option without 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET). In the 203 patients with follow-up 6 months after 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, the therapies effectively implemented as well as follow-up PSA levels were evaluated, with a PSA value of <0.2 ng/ml representing a complete response and a decrease in PSA value of at least 50% from baseline representing a partial response.  Results: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was positive and identified recurrence in 166 of the 223 patients (74%), with a detection rate of 50% for recurrent disease at low PSA values of <0.5 ng/ml. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET led to a change in management in 122 of the 203 patients (60%). A substantial increase in the use of metastasis-targeted treatment and a reduction in the use of systemic treatment were observed, with 59 of the 203 patients (29%) undergoing targeted radiotherapy (RTXa) only, and 20 patients (10%) undergoing RTXa with hormonal therapy as the two most frequently selected therapy options. The proportion of patients in whom systemic therapy was selected decreased from 60% (133 of 223 patients) to 34% (70 of 203 patients) on the basis of the information provided by the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scan. PSMA PET-directed metastasis-targeted treatment led to a complete response after 6 months in 45% of patients.  Conclusion:   The high rate of recurrence detection by PSMA PET was confirmed and PSMA PET led to a change in management in 60% of patients.

European guidelines (EAU) recommend SRT at a PSA < 0.5 ng/ml. We analyze the efficacy of SRT given according to this recommendation and investigate the predictive power of the post-SRT PSA nadir.  Methods:   Between 1998 and 2013, 301 patients of two university hospitals received SRT at a PSA < 0.5 ng/ml (median 0.192 ng/ml, IQR 0.110-0.300). Patients, who previously received androgen deprivation therapy, were excluded. All patients had 3D-conformal RT or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT, n = 59) (median 66.6 Gy). The median follow-up was 5.9 years. Progression and overall survival were the endpoints.  Results:   After SRT, 252 patients re-achieved an undetectable PSA. In univariate analysis, pre-RP PSA ≥ 10 ng/ml, pT3-4, Gleason score (GS) 7-10 or 8-10, negative surgical margins, post-RP PSA ≥ 0.1 ng/ml, pre-SRT PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml and post-SRT PSA nadir ≥ 0.1 ng/ml correlated unfavorably with post-SRT progression. In a multivariable Cox model, pT3-4, GS 7-10, negative margins and a pre-SRT PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml were significant risk factors. If the post-SRT PSA was added to the analysis, it dominated the outcome (HR = 9.00). Of the patients with a pre-SRT PSA < 0.2 ng/ml, only 9% failed re-achieving an undetectable PSA. Overall survival in these patients was 98% after 5.9 years compared to 91% in patients with higher pre-SRT PSA (Logrank p = 0.004).  Conclusions:   SRT at a PSA < 0.2 ng/ml correlates significantly with achieving a post-SRT undetectable PSA (<0.1 ng/ml) and subsequently with improved freedom from progression.

However, evidence is limited on whether NSAIDs protect against prostate cancer mortality (death from prostate cancer among men without a cancer history) and case fatality (death from prostate cancer among men with prostate cancer), and whether benefits are consistent in white and black men. This study investigated associations of aspirin and non-aspirin (NA) NSAID use with prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and case fatality in a population-based cohort of white and black men.  Methods:   We included 6,594 men (5,060 white and 1,534 black) from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study without a cancer history at enrollment from 1987 to 1989. NSAID use was assessed at four study visits (1987-1998). Cancer outcomes were ascertained through 2012. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate adjusted HRs, overall and by race.  Results:   Aspirin use was not associated with prostate cancer incidence. However, aspirin use was inversely associated with prostate cancer mortality [HR, 0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.36-0.96]. This association was consistent among white and black men and appeared restricted to men using aspirin daily and/or for cardiovascular disease prevention. Aspirin use was inversely associated with case fatality (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22-0.94). NA-NSAID use was not associated with these endpoints.

LNCaP, PC3 and DU145 were co-cultured with vascular endothelial cells to determine the optimal concentration of G-Rh2 by MTT assay. LNCaP, PC3 and DU145 were cultured under the selected concentration (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/mL) of G-Rh2, and the expression levels of CD31, VEGF, PDGF and CNNM1 detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. The expression pattern of CD31 was detected in CNNM1 overexpressed and knockout LNCaP, PC3 and DU145 cells under G-Rh2. G-Rh2 significantly inhibited the growth of all three prostate cancer cell lines in the dorsum of nude mice (P <0.05), and the increment rate of vascular endothelial cells co-cultured with LNCaP, PC3 and DU145 (P <0.05).

Although many benefit, ADT is also used in patients with little or nothing to gain. The best ways to stop this practice are unknown, and range from blunt pharmacy restrictions to informed decision-making. This study will refine and pilot two different de-implementation strategies for reducing ADT use among those unlikely to benefit in preparation for a comparative effectiveness trial.  Methods/design:   This innovative mixed methods research program has three aims. Aim 1: To assess preferences and barriers for de-implementation of chemical castration in prostate cancer. Guided by the theoretical domains framework (TDF), urologists and patients from facilities with the highest and lowest castration rates across the VA will be interviewed to identify key preferences and de-implementation barriers for reducing castration as prostate cancer treatment. This qualitative work will inform Aim 2 while gathering rich information for two proposed pilot intervention strategies. Aim 2: To use a discrete choice experiment (DCE), a novel barrier prioritization approach, for de-implementation strategy tailoring. The investigators will conduct national surveys of urologists to prioritize key barriers identified in Aim 1 for stopping incident castration as localized prostate cancer treatment using a DCE experiment design. These quantitative results will identify the most important barriers to be addressed through tailoring of two pilot de-implementation strategies in preparation for Aim 3 piloting. Aim 3: To pilot two tailored de-implementation strategies to reduce castration as localized prostate cancer treatment. Building on findings from Aims 1 and 2, two de-implementation strategies will be piloted. One strategy will focus on formulary restriction at the organizational level and the other on physician/patient informed decision-making at different facilities. Outcomes will include acceptability, feasibility, and scalability in preparation for an effectiveness trial comparing these two widely varying de-implementation strategies.  Discussion:   Our innovative approach to de-implementation strategy development is directly aligned with state-of-the-art complex implementation intervention development and implementation science. This work will broadly advance de-implementation science for low value cancer care, and foster participation in our de-implementation evaluation trial by addressing barriers, facilitators, and concerns through pilot tailoring.

Whether CFTR plays a role in BPA-induced prostate cancer needs to be further identified. In this study, two prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP were exposed to BPA for detecting the cytotoxic reactions by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. After the treatment with BPA for 24 hours, the cell viability was decreased significantly with increased cell apoptosis in the two cell lines. Moreover, both PC-3 and LNCaP cells had a reduced expression level of cAMP, CFTR, and adenosine triphosphate upon BPA treatment.

Here, we assessed how nucleosome structure impacts the positions of UV-induced mutations in human melanomas. Analysis of mutation positions from cutaneous melanomas within strongly positioned nucleosomes revealed a striking ~10 base pair (bp) oscillation in mutation density with peaks occurring at dinucleotides facing away from the histone octamer. Additionally, higher mutation density at the nucleosome dyad generated an overarching ""translational curvature"" across the 147 bp of DNA that constitutes the nucleosome core particle. This periodicity and curvature cannot be explained by sequence biases in nucleosomal DNA. Instead, our genome-wide map of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) indicates that CPD formation is elevated at outward facing dinucleotides, mirroring the oscillation of mutation density within nucleosome-bound DNA. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity, as measured by XR-seq, inversely correlated with the curvature of mutation density associated with the translational setting of the nucleosome. While the 10 bp periodicity of mutations is maintained across nucleosomes regardless of chromatin state, histone modifications, and transcription levels, overall mutation density and curvature across the core particle increased with lower transcription levels. Our observations suggest structural conformations of DNA promote CPD formation at specific sites within nucleosomes, and steric hindrance progressively limits lesion repair towards the nucleosome dyad. Both mechanisms create a unique extended mutation signature within strongly positioned nucleosomes across the human genome.""","""['Alexander J Brown', 'Peng Mao', 'Michael J Smerdon', 'John J Wyrick', 'Steven A Roberts']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['Elevated pyrimidine dimer formation at distinct genomic bases underlies promoter mutation hotspots in UV-exposed cancers.', 'Chromosomal landscape of UV damage formation and repair at single-nucleotide resolution.', 'Ultraviolet damage and nucleosome folding of the 5S ribosomal RNA gene.', 'Open, repair and close again: chromatin dynamics and the response to UV-induced DNA damage.', 'Recurrent Noncoding Mutations in Skin Cancers: UV Damage Susceptibility or Repair Inhibition as Primary Driver?', 'Genome-wide maps of rare and atypical UV photoproducts reveal distinct patterns of damage formation and mutagenesis in yeast chromatin.', 'Damage mapping techniques and the light they have shed on canonical and atypical UV photoproducts.', 'Molecular mechanism of UV damage modulation in nucleosomes.', 'Strand asymmetry influences mismatch resolution during a single-strand annealing.', 'Mechanisms of UV-induced mutations and skin cancer.']"""

It is widely known that prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer, and hypoxia is a common characteristic of many solid tumors, including prostate cancer. In this study, we designed multifunctional fluorescent inhibitors to target PSMA and tumor hypoxia in order to increase the tumor uptake of inhibitors. Novel PSMA inhibitors were prepared using lysine as the backbone to connect three different functional groups: the glutamate-urea-lysine (GUL) structure for inhibiting PSMA, 2-nitroimidazole for the hypoxia-sensitive moiety, and a near-infrared fluorophore (sulfo-Cyanine 5.5). According to the in vitro PSMA binding assay, novel fluorescent inhibitors were demonstrated to have nanomolar binding affinities. Multifunctional inhibitor 2 with one 2-nitroimidazole had a similar inhibitory activity to inhibitor 1 that did not contain the hypoxia targeting moiety, but multifunctional inhibitor 3 with two 2-nitroimidazoles showed lower inhibitory activity than inhibitor 1 due to the bulky structure of the hypoxia-sensitive group. However, in vivo optical imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies indicated that both multifunctional inhibitors 2 and 3 had higher accumulation in tumors than inhibitor 1 due to a synergistic combination of PSMA and hypoxia targeting moieties.

However, conventional approaches limit biomarker detection at the single-cell level. Here, we fabricated a polymer microwell array to capture single cells from prostate-cancer cell lines and quantitatively analyzed the expression of three different cancer-related biomarkers, CD44, EpCAM, and PSMA, without a membrane protein-extraction step. The resulting information on cell-surface biomarker distributions was compared with that from other standard analytical techniques. Interestingly, a large variation in CD44-expression levels was observed when the cell-proliferation cycle was modulated. On the other hand, the expression levels of EpCAM in three different cell lines are consistent among the different analytical methods with the exception of the microarray, where it has a different substrate material to adhere to. This observation clearly emphasizes that biomarker choice and environmental control are critical for properly understanding the single-cell state.""","""['Hojun Kim', 'Sungwook Park', 'Benedict J Kang', 'Youngdo Jeong', 'Hyojin Lee', 'Kwan Hyi Lee']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""ACS Comb Sci""","""['Tumor-Derived Exosomal Long Noncoding RNAs as Promising Diagnostic Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Cloning and characterization of canine prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Lgr5+CD44+EpCAM+ Strictly Defines Cancer Stem Cells in Human Colorectal Cancer.', 'Targeting Nanomedicines to Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Specificity of Ligands to Two Different Receptors In Vivo.', 'Current use of PSMA-PET in prostate cancer management.']"""

Diagnosis and treatment are challenging, even in reference centers, and survival is influenced by the aggressiveness of certain histologies and absence of a standard of care.  Patients and methods:   The authors report the results of a retrospective analysis of patients that attended the Institute of Oncology, Bucharest, between 2004 and 2015, for nonmetastatic pelvic malignant tumor treatment and follow-up. The outcomes are compared between the rare and common histology groups.  Results:   Of the 60 cases analyzed, 17 patients (28.33%) bore a rare tumor, 33 (55%) were women, and the median age was 59 years. The majority was concerned by bladder (41.66%, 25 patients) and cervix (23.33%, 14 patients) neoplasms. For a median follow-up of 27.5 months, relapse was registered in 27 patients (45%), of whom 9 (33.33%) were from the rare group (53% of this subpopulation). The highest relapse rates were recorded in patients with rare bladder tumors (66.7%, 4 patients) compared with 42.1% (8 patients) in the common group (p = 0.294) and in prostate localization (66.7%, 2 patients) compared with 16.7% (1 patient) (p = 0.134). Estimated median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 60, 12 months in the rare group and 67 months for common tumors.

Ra-223 improved overall survival in the international Phase III ALSYMPCA (ALpharadin in SYMPtomatic Prostate Cancer) study. Ra-223 was also demonstrated to be efficacious and safe in Japanese patients in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. Ra-223 was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with CRPC with bone metastasis in 2016. The conduct of clinical studies with radionuclides in Japan involves mandatory compliance with local and international regulations pertaining to radiation protection. Without an existing Japanese framework for the handling of α-emitters in clinical practice, we encountered many challenges to initiate the clinical studies. Therefore, we started on a project to determine best practice on the use of Ra-223 in clinical studies. For this project, we evaluated all applicable laws and regulations on the use of radionuclides in medicine, then examined whether and how the α-emitter Ra-223 could meet these legal and regulatory requirements. This included how to approach the matter of discharging patients administered Ra-223 from hospital and radiation protection for caregivers, general public and medical care professionals. Subsequently, we published Manual on the proper use of radium-223 dichloride injection in clinical trials that summarized the essential requirements necessary to allow the safe use of Ra-223 in clinical trials in Japan. As the result, we succeeded in demonstrating that clinical trials of an α-emitter, Ra-223, could be implemented safely in Japan. Our experience in Japan highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary team-based approach and continued professional training in a clinical setting. This article summarizes the rationale behind the development of this manual. We hope that by sharing our experience and information, we can help other countries considering the introduction of radionuclides for clinical use, and support the future development of radionuclide therapies in a safe and effective manner.""","""['Makoto Hosono', 'Hideharu Ikebuchi', 'Yoshihide Nakamura', 'Sachiko Yanagida', 'Seigo Kinuya']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['Nursing management of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer undergoing radium-223 dichloride treatment.', 'Radium-223 dichloride: a novel treatment option for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'Radium-223 in the treatment of osteoblastic metastases: a critical clinical review.', 'Radium Ra 223 dichloride in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Phase II study of radium-223 dichloride in Japanese patients with symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', '223Ra RaCl2 nanomicelles showed potent effect against osteosarcoma: targeted alpha therapy in the nanotechnology era.', 'Clinical Perspectives of Theranostics.', 'Dosimetry of inhaled 219Rn progeny.', 'α-Emitting cancer therapy using 211 At-AAMT targeting LAT1.', 'A randomized, double-blind, comparison of radium-223 and placebo, in combination with abiraterone acetate and prednisolone, in castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer: subgroup analysis of Japanese patients in the ERA 223 study.']"""

Methods:   Patients diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) in 2001-2010 and prostatectomized within 180 days of biopsy were identified in the Cancer Registry of Norway and the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Registry. Patients were stratified according to risk groups and RP-intervals of 0-60, 61-90, 91-120 and 121-180 days.

Recently, QRFP has been demonstrated to exert its effects by activating the G protein‑coupled receptor GPR103. QRFP is expressed in the brain and peripherally in the adipose tissue, bladder, colon, testis, parathyroid and thyroid gland, as well as in the prostate gland. Following lung cancer, prostate cancer constitutes the second most frequently diagnosed cancer among men, whilst obesity appears to be a contributing factor for aggressive prostate cancer. In the present study, we sought to investigate the role of QRFP in prostate cancer, using two androgen‑independent human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and DU145) as in vitro experimental models and clinical human prostate cancer samples. The expression of both QRFP and GPR103 at the gene and protein level was higher in human prostate cancer tissue samples compared to control and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP) samples. Furthermore, in both prostate cancer cell lines used in the present study, QRFP treatment induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, JNK and Akt. In addition, QRFP increased cell migration and invasion in these in vitro models, with the increased expression of MMP2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the pleiotropic adipokine, leptin, increased the expression of QRFP and GPR103 in PC3 prostate cancer cells via a PI3K‑ and MAPK‑dependent mechanism, indicating a novel potential link between adiposity and prostate cancer.

These androgens are synthesized through the steroidogenic pathway within the prostate, and their synthesis is altered in PCa. The present study aimed to determine the ZEB1‑induced alterations in androgen synthesis and AR expression in the DU145 PCa cell line. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunocytochemistry were used to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels, and cellular localization of steroidogenic pathway enzymes in the DU145 cell line in response to ZEB1 silencing. Furthermore, the concentrations of testosterone and DHT were detected in cell culture medium using ELISA. ZEB1‑silenced cells exhibited an increase in testosterone and DHT production, an increase in AR expression and an alteration in the steroidogenic pathway. In particular, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and 5α‑reductase 2 expression levels were decreased, whereas cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1, 5α‑reductase 1, aldo‑keto reductase family 1 member D1 and aldo‑keto reductase family 1 member C2 expression levels were increased.

Recent studies have reported that the abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with the mechanism underlying the development of PCa. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of miR‑30e and its target gene, M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRM3), on the adhesion, migration, invasion and cell cycle distribution of PCa cells via the mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The differentially expressed genes were screened in the Gene Expression Omnibus database from a gene expression microarray (GSE55945) of PCa. PCa tissues and adjacent tissues were collected from patients with PCa. The PC‑3 and DU145 human PCa cell lines were treated with activator, inhibitor and siRNAs. The effects of miR‑30e on cell adhesion, migration, invasion and cell cycle distribution with the involvement of CHRM3 and the MAPK signaling pathway were investigated. The bioinformatics results demonstrated that the CHRM3 gene and the MAKP signaling pathway were involved in the progression of PCa, and has‑miR‑30e was selected for further study. The levels of miR‑30e were significantly downregulated, while the levels of CHRM3 were obviously upregulated in PCa. CHRM3 was verified as a target gene of miR‑30e. Upregulation of miR‑30e and downregulation of CHRM3 decreased the levels of p‑P38, p‑extracellular signal‑regulated kinase, p‑c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase, p‑c‑fos and p‑c‑JUN, cell adhesion, migration and invasion ability, and the number of cells in the S phase, while they increased the number of cells in the G0 and G1 phases. The findings of the present study suggest that miR‑30e inhibited the adhesion, migration, invasion and cell cycle entry of PCa cells by suppressing the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and inhibiting CHRM3 expression. Thus, miR‑30e may serve as a candidate target for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Xin-Min Zheng#', 'Peng Zhang#', 'Man-Hua Liu#', 'Ping Chen', 'Wei-Bing Zhang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Tumor-suppressive microRNA-223 inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion by targeting ITGA3/ITGB1 signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of the expression and association of retinoblastoma binding protein 6 with the JNK signaling pathway in prostate cancers.', 'TERF1 downregulation promotes the migration and invasion of the PC3 prostate cancer cell line as a target of miR‑155.', 'microRNA-372 Suppresses Migration and Invasion by Targeting p65 in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'miRNA-guided reprogramming of glucose and glutamine metabolism and its impact on cell adhesion/migration during solid tumor progression.', 'Betulinaldehyde exhibits effective anti-tumor effects in A549 cells by regulating intracellular autophagy.', 'Transmembrane Domain 3 Is a Transplantable Pharmacophore in the Photodynamic Activation of Cholecystokinin 1 Receptor.', 'Anticancer function of microRNA-30e is mediated by negative regulation of HELLPAR, a noncoding macroRNA, and genes involved in ubiquitination and cell cycle progression in prostate cancer.', 'Muscarinic Receptors Associated with Cancer.', 'Cholinergic blockade of neuroinflammation: from tissue to RNA regulators.']"""

However, long-term results at followup (FU) ≥5 years are usually needed to ensure robustness of reported outcomes. Potential benefit of salvage therapy is, nevertheless, higher when relapse is diagnosed early. This study aimed to solve this dilemma by evaluating the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir for early prediction of long-term biochemical control.  Methods and materials:   Combined pelvis-external beam radiation/HDR-BT boost to EQD2 >100 Gy (α/β = 3) was performed in 459 consecutively treated patients. These patients with an FU ≥ 24 months were analyzed and stratified in PSA nadir (nPSA)-groups by PSA nadir within 18 months after radiotherapy (nPSA18). Kaplan-Meier/log-rank tests and Cox-regression models were used to compare the study endpoints.  Results:   The mean FU was 77 months. A PSA nadir within 18 months (nPSA18) <0.5 ng/mL was achieved in 222 patients with median time to reach nPSA18 of 7 months. The 5-year American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) biochemical control (prostate-specific antigen disease-free survival) for the nPSA18 group <0.5 ng/mL was 89% and for the group ≥ 0.5 ng/mL, it was 78.6% (p = 0.011). nPSA18 was an independent predictor of cancer-specific survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and biochemical control (ASTRO) (p = 0.026, p = 0.020, and p = 0.01, respectively).  Conclusions:   The present results suggest that the PSA nadir level within 18 months after radiotherapy may serve as an early parameter for long-term biochemical control according to ASTRO definitions following radical dose escalation by HDR-BT for prostate cancer.

There is a need for a novel noninvasive diagnostic tool that achieves a significantly high pretest probability for PCa, reducing unnecessary biopsy numbers. Recent studies have shown that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath can be used to detect different types of cancers via training of an artificial neural network (ANN).  Objective:   To determine whether exhaled-breath analysis using a handheld electronic nose device can be used to discriminate between VOC patterns between PCa patients and healthy individuals.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective pilot study was conducted in the outpatient urology clinic of the Maastricht University Medical Center, the Netherlands. Patients with histologically proven PCa were already included before initial biopsy or during follow-up, with no prior treatment for their PCa. Urological patients with negative biopsies in the past year or patients with prostate enlargement (PE) with low or stable serum prostate-specific antigen were used as controls. Exhaled breath was probed from 85 patients: 32 with PCa and 53 controls (30 having negative biopsies and 23 PE).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patient characteristics were statistically analyzed using independent sample t test and Pearson's chi-square test. Data analysis was performed by Aethena software after data compression using the TUCKER3 algorithm. ANN models were trained and evaluated using the leave-10%-out cross-validation method.  Results and limitations:   Our trained ANN showed an accuracy of 0.75, with an area under the curve of 0.79 with sensitivity and specificity of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.94) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.55-0.81) respectively, comparing PCa with control individuals. The negative predictive value was found to be 0.88. The main limitation is the relatively small sample size.  Conclusions:   Our findings imply that the Aeonose allows us to discriminate between patients with untreated, histologically proven primary PCa and control patients based on exhaled-breath analysis.  Patient summary:   We explored the possibility of exhaled-breath analysis using an electronic nose, to be used as a noninvasive tool in clinical practice, as a pretest for diagnosing prostate cancer.

Finally, the newly identified groups of co-morbid conditions were compared with the CCI and Klabunde indexes.  Results:   Our SA identified 10 and 7 individual co-morbid conditions able to predict 90-day medical and surgical complications respectively.

The specific targeting capability on CSCs is of high importance for the development of effective anti-tumor therapeutics. However, isolation, enrichment and cultivation of these special and rare groups of tumor cells for in vitro analyses is a nontrivial job and requires particular culture medium and environmental control. Herein, we established a low-cost and efficient method for CSC enrichment by culturing prostate cancer cells on a hydrophilic filter paper. We found that tumor spheroids could form spontaneously on a pristine filter paper solely with regular cell culture medium. The paper-grown cells had elevated expression of putative CSC markers, indicating increased stemness of the cancer cells. Moreover, increased resistance of the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin was observed on the formed CSC spheroids compared to regular culture. The properties of the filter paper were characterized to investigate the underlying mechanism behind the promoted tumor spheroid formation. The obtained results suggested that the excellent hydrophilicity of the cellulose fibers retarded the hydrophobic interaction-mediated cell anchoring on the cellulose fibers, while the limited space/niche between fibers promoted the aggregation of cells. In addition, biocompatible paper-based materials are able to realize convenient assembly of tissue-like structures for developing in vitro disease models or organs-on-paper applications. Therefore, hydrophilic filter papers could be a low-cost material for construction of various assay platforms for isolating and enriching CSCs, screening anti-tumor drugs, and constructing tumor models in vitro.""","""['Jing Jing Fu', 'Ying Zhou', 'Xiao Xiao Shi', 'Yue Jun Kang', 'Zhi Song Lu', 'Yuan Li', 'Chang Ming Li', 'Ling Yu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces""","""['Enrichment of cancer stem cells by agarose multi-well dishes and 3D spheroid culture.', 'An alginate-based platform for cancer stem cell research.', 'Head and Neck Cancer Stem Cell-Enriched Spheroid Model for Anticancer Compound Screening.', 'Tumor-derived spheroids: Relevance to cancer stem cells and clinical applications.', 'CD90 a potential cancer stem cell marker and a therapeutic target.', 'Targeting Cancer Stem Cells as the Key Driver of Carcinogenesis and Therapeutic Resistance.', 'Lyophilized Gelatin@non-Woven Scaffold to Promote Spheroids Formation and Enrich Cancer Stem Cell Incidence.', 'Cancer Stem Cells in Tumor Modeling: Challenges and Future Directions.', 'Biomaterial-based platforms for cancer stem cell enrichment and study.', 'Advances in Liver Cancer Stem Cell Isolation and their Characterization.']"""

This arises the need for designing treatment plans with short execution times. We propose an objective function for plan quality evaluation, which was used to determine an optimal combination between small and large collimators based on short treatment times and clinically acceptable dose distributions. Data from 11 prostate cancer patients were used. For each patient, 20 plans were created based on all combinations between one small (⌀ 10-25 mm) and one large (⌀ 35-60 mm) Iris collimator size. The objective function was assigned to each combination as a penalty, such that plans with low penalties were considered superior. This function considered the achievement of dosimetric planning goals, tumor control probability, normal tissue complication probability, relative seriality parameter, and treatment time. Two methods were used to determine the optimal combination. First, we constructed heat maps representing the mean penalty values and standard deviations of the plans created for each collimator combination. The combination giving a plan with the smallest mean penalty and standard deviation was considered optimal. Second, we created two groups of superior plans: group A plans were selected by histogram analysis and group B plans were selected by choosing the plan with the lowest penalty from each patient. In both groups, the most used small and large collimators were assumed to represent the optimal combination. The optimal combinations obtained from the heat maps included the 25 mm as a small collimator, giving small/large collimator sizes of 25/35, 25/40, 25/50, and 25/60 mm. The superior-group analysis indicated that 25/50 mm was the optimal combination. The optimal Iris combination for prostate cancer treatment using CyberKnife was determined to be a collimator size between 25 mm (small) and 50 mm (large).""","""['Maria Varnava', 'Iori Sumida', 'Hirokazu Mizuno', 'Hiroya Shiomi', 'Osamu Suzuki', 'Yasuo Yoshioka', 'Kazuhiko Ogawa']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Dosimetric Comparison Between 3-Dimensional Conformal and Robotic SBRT Treatment Plans for Accelerated Partial Breast Radiotherapy.', 'Clinical usefulness of MLCs in robotic radiosurgery systems for prostate SBRT.', 'Variable circular collimator in robotic radiosurgery: a time-efficient alternative to a mini-multileaf collimator?', 'Assessment of Monte Carlo algorithm for compliance with RTOG 0915 dosimetric criteria in peripheral lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery and radiation therapy treatment planning system.', 'Intrafraction Prostate Motion Management During Dose-Escalated Linac-Based Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.', 'Comparison of Two Cyberknife Planning Approaches for Multiple Brain Metastases.', 'Plan comparison of prostate stereotactic radiotherapy in spacer implant patients.', 'Integrating CVH and LVH metrics into an optimization strategy for the selection of Iris collimator for Cyberknife Xsight lung tracking treatment.']"""

While interaction with Bcl-2 and Bcl-2-like family in apoptosis modulation implicated its possible role in various human cancers. However, the investigation of this gene in prostate cancer is mainly ignored. Here in our current study, we focused on its role in prostate cancer and found that RTN4 DNA copy numbers were higher in prostate cancer than normal prostate gland while its RNA and protein expressions were relatively lower. Chromosomal neighbor gene EML6 had similar expression patterns with RTN4 in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines, and further research found that they could be both targeted by miR-148a-3p. Lentivirus-mediated RTN4 overexpression potently inhibited DU145 and LNCaP cells proliferation. Cell cycle was blocked in G2/M phase and significant cell senescence was observed in RTN4 overexpressed prostate cancer cells. Finally, interaction networks in the normal prostate gland and cancer tissues further revealed that RTN4 maybe phosphorylated by MAPKAPK2 and FYN at tyrosine 591 and serine 107, respectively.

Results:   On MR scans, CG were visible in 98% (117/120) on both sides and in two patients only on the left side. Mistakable CG shape was detected in 69% (83/120) of patients on both or at least one side. The left CG were thicker (4±1.4 mm; range: 1.5-7.5 mm) than the right ones (3±1.3 mm; range: 0.5-7 mm). Mean SUVmax was 2.51±1.17 (range: 0.02-5.48) in the left CG and 2.23±1.22 (range: 0.02-5.91) in the right CG. Increased Ga-PSMA-11 uptake, SUVmax at least 2, was detected in 75% (90/120), and both - erroneous shape and elevated Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake - was observed in 55% (66/120) of all patients on both sides or at least one side.  Conclusion:   Frequently observed, the nodular, oval and longitudinal (nodular, thick or with oval parts) shape of CG, especially of the thicker left CG, on MR scans may cause mistaking them for lymph nodes, even abnormal or metastatic. On whole-body PET/MRI, evident and sometimes high Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in CG increases the risk of a misinterpretation of them as metastases.""","""['Ewa J Bialek', 'Bogdan Malkowski']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['Are superior cervical sympathetic ganglia avid on whole body 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/magnetic resonance?: a comprehensive morphologic and molecular assessment in patients with prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The ""question-mark"" MR anatomy of the cervico-thoracic ganglia complex: can it help to avoid mistaking it for a malignant lesion on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MR?', '68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC Uptake in Cervical, Celiac, and Sacral Ganglia as an Important Pitfall in Prostate Cancer PET Imaging.', 'Whole-Body Integrated 68GaPSMA-11-PET/MR Imaging in Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Comparison with Whole-Body PET/CT as the Standard of Reference.', 'PSMA-1007 Uptake in Ganglia of the Sympathetic Trunk and Its Intra-individual Reproducibility.', 'The future of PSMA PET and WB MRI as next-generation imaging tools in prostate cancer.', 'Intraindividual comparison of 68\xa0Ga-Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-F-PSMA-1007 in prostate cancer patients: a retrospective single-center analysis.', 'Intra-patient comparison of physiologic 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT uptake in ganglia in prostate cancer patients: a pictorial essay.', 'Use of 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-FDG PET-CT Dual-Tracer to Differentiate Between Lymph Node Metastases and Ganglia.']"""

Urethrography is often used to localise the prostatic apex. However, urethrography is an invasive localisation procedure and may introduce a systemic error. The penile bulb (PB) is contoured to minimise the risk of erectile dysfunction. The purpose of this study is to assess the value of using the PB, as an alternative to urethrography, to localise the prostate.  Methods and materials:   The PB was localised on 10 patients treated with simplified intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy at computed tomography simulation during treatment weeks 1 and 7. All patients underwent placement of fiducial markers. Urethrography was used only at simulation. Distances from the superior PB contour to the inferior prostate contour, the apex fiducial marker, and to the inferior prostate contour were obtained as well. The PB was contoured by two observers independently. Agreement coefficients and analysis of variance were used to assess reliability between rates and consistency of measurements over time.  Results:   The PB-apex distance was greater than or equal to the urethrogram-apex distance in 24/30 (80%) measurements, and the median difference was 3 mm and was consistent between raters. The greatest variation in PB-IM distance between weeks was 6 mm, the median was 3 mm, and the agreements of measurements between weeks for raters 1 and 2 were 0.79 and 0.69, respectively. These differences were not statistically different and were consistent with the computed tomography slice thickness.  Conclusions:   The PB can be used to identify the prostate apex and can be reliably contoured between observers. Measurements are consistent between patients and through the duration of treatment. The PB distance measurements support studies indicating that urethrography causes a shift of the prostate superiorly. The distance from the PB to prostate apex remains stable during treatment for individual patients but varies between patients.""","""['Michael I Lock', 'Alicia Heinrichs', 'Gaurav Bhattacharya', 'Ellen Cusano', 'Robert Ash', ""David D'Souza"", 'George Rodrigues', 'Robert Dinniwell', 'Varagur Venkatesan', 'Glenn Bauman', 'Eugene Wong']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Sci""","""['Bulb of penis as a marker for prostatic apex in external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Vessel-sparing prostate radiotherapy: dose limitation to critical erectile vascular structures (internal pudendal artery and corpus cavernosum) defined by MRI.', 'Penile bulb sparing in prostate cancer radiotherapy : Dose analysis of an in-house MRI system to improve contouring.', 'Prostate Bed Delineation Guidelines for Postoperative Radiation Therapy: On Behalf Of The Francophone Group of Urological Radiation Therapy.', 'Radiation therapy for prostate cancer and erectile (dys)function: the role of imaging.', 'Assessing Inter-Fraction Changes in The Size and Position of The Penile Bulb During Daily MR-Guided Radiation Therapy to The Prostate Bed: Do We Need to Adjust How We Plan Radiation in The Post-Radical Prostatectomy Setting to Reduce Risk of Erectile Dysfunction?']"""

Daily treatments may be delayed until appropriate volumes are attained; the resultant psychological impact of these delays on patients is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine levels of anxiety, depression, distress, and bother related to bowel preparation for prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy treatment.  Methods:   A prospective cohort analysis of prostate cancer patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy was completed. Patients were assigned to one of three groups; Group A was standard of care, Group B was standard of care plus increased educational information regarding bowel preparation, Group C was standard of care plus increased educational information regarding bowel preparation plus an anti-flatulent medication. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Distress Thermometer, and a Bowel Status Bother survey were completed by participants at the start of theircourse of radiation treatment, mid-way through, and at the end. Analysis of variance testing was completed to determine differences in mean scores between the three groups.  Results:   Mean age of patients (N = 30) was 66 years; 50% of the participants had a university education; 80% were married. Anxiety levels decreased over time in all groups (P = .039) with no difference between groups (P = 0.447). Depression levels across time for each group remained low (P = .577). Overall distress levels associated with bowel preparation were low among each group, and no significant differences were reported (P = .978). All groups reported high rates of quality of life.

Our optimized ex-vivo approach sustains tumor slices for up to 15 days under culture conditions that maintain proliferation and oxygenation rates, as measured by EdU incorporation and pimonidazole staining, respectively.

A computer-based processing method (i) controls variations in DNA content and slicing on the number of repair foci and (ii) measures the PARPi-mediated enhancement ratio on DSB foci numbers to ensure inter-patient-comparability. We validated this approach using a PC3 xenograft model with its previously described repair switch to PARP1-EJ. More importantly, we show that approximately 30% of the analyzed tumor tissue samples collected from PCa patients display a switch to PARP1-EJ, as indicated by the enhanced number of residual γH2AX/53BP1 foci exclusively after PARPi+RT. Furthermore, normal prostatic tissues show no repair switch to PARP1-EJ, indicating that this repair switch and its associated radiosensitizing effect is tumor-specific.

While biparametric MRI (bpMRI) including T2-weighted (T2w) and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) is an accurate tool to localize PCa, its value is less clear in the case of additional androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The aim of this study was to investigate the value of a textural feature (TF) approach on bpMRI analysis in prostate cancer patients with and without neoadjuvant ADT with respect to future dose-painting applications.  Methods:   28 PCa patients (54-80 years) with (n = 14) and without (n = 14) ADT who underwent bpMRI with T2w and DWI were analyzed retrospectively. Lesions, central gland (CG), and peripheral zone (PZ) were delineated by an experienced urogenital radiologist based on localized pre-therapeutic histopathology. Histogram parameters and 20 Haralick TF were calculated. Regional differences (i. e., tumor vs. PZ, tumor vs. CG) were analyzed for all imaging parameters. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to measure diagnostic performance to distinguish PCa from benign prostate tissue and to identify the features with best discriminative power in both patient groups.  Results:   The obtained sensitivities were equivalent or superior when utilizing the TF in the no-ADT group, while specificity was higher for the histogram parameters. However, in the ADT group, TF outperformed the conventional histogram parameters in both specificity and sensitivity. Rule-in and rule-out criteria for ADT patients could exclusively be defined with the aid of TF.

This is in part because prostate cancers adaptively switch to the androgen/AR-independent pathway for survival and growth, thereby conferring therapy resistance. Tumor hypoxia is considered as a major cause of treatment resistance. However, the exact mechanism is largely unclear. Here we report that chronic-androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the condition of hypoxia induces adaptive androgen/AR-independence, and therefore confers resistance to androgen/AR-targeted therapy, e.g., enzalutamide. Mechanistically, this is mediated by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), which is transcriptionally repressed by AR in hypoxia, but restored and increased by AR inhibition.

It was recently reported using in vitro prostate cancer cell lines that excess extracellular iron (EEI) diminishes anti-cancer effects of VC, promoting the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generated by VC. Here we demonstrated that EEI diminished the inhibitory effect of VC on the survival of K562 human leukemic cells in vitro, by reducing the amount of H2O2 and abrogating the apoptosis pathways induced by VC. In vivo, in the presence of EEI, the growth inhibitory effect of VC on K562 cells was completely abrogated; in fact, VC enhanced K562 cell growth. Reduction of EEI restored the apoptosis-inducing effect of VC in vitro and enhanced the growth inhibitory effect of VC in vivo.

Cell signaling kinases are important for regulating lipid synthesis and energy storage. How upstream kinases regulate lipid content, versus direct targeting of lipid-metabolizing enzymes, is currently unexplored. We evaluated intracellular lipid concentrations in prostate and breast tumor spheroids, treated with drugs directly inhibiting metabolic enzymes fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), diacylglyceride acyltransferase (DGAT), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK), or cell signaling kinase enzymes PI3K, AKT, and mTOR with lipidomic analysis. We assessed whether baseline lipid profiles corresponded to inhibitors' effectiveness in modulating lipid profiles in three-dimensional (3D) growth and their relationship to therapeutic activity. Inhibitors against PI3K, AKT, and mTOR significantly inhibited MDA-MB-468 and PC3 cell growth in two-dimensional (2D) and 3D spheroid growth, while moderately altering lipid content. Conversely, metabolism inhibitors against FASN and DGAT altered lipid content most effectively, while only moderately inhibiting growth compared with kinase inhibitors. The FASN and ACC inhibitors' effectiveness in MDA-MB-468, versus PC3, suggested the former depended more on synthesis, whereas the latter may salvage lipids. Although baseline lipid profiles did not predict growth effects, lipid changes on therapy matched the growth effects of FASN and DGAT inhibitors. Several phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, were also upregulated following treatment, possibly via the Kennedy pathway. As this promotes tumor growth, combination studies should include drugs targeting it. Two-dimensional drug screening may miss important metabolism inhibitors or underestimate their potency. Clinical studies should consider serial measurements of tumor lipids to prove target modulation. Pretherapy tumor classification by de novo lipid synthesis versus uptake may help demonstrate efficacy.""","""['Dylan T Jones', 'Alessandro Valli', 'Syed Haider', 'Qifeng Zhang', 'Elizabeth A Smethurst', 'Zachary T Schug', 'Barrie Peck', 'Eric O Aboagye', 'Susan E Critchlow', 'Almut Schulze', 'Eyal Gottlieb', 'Michael J O Wakelam', 'Adrian L Harris']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase suppresses fatty acid synthesis and tumor growth of non-small-cell lung cancer in preclinical models.', 'Arsenic disulfide‑induced apoptosis and its potential mechanism in two‑ and three‑dimensionally cultured human breast cancer MCF‑7 cells.', 'Comparison of cancer cells in 2D vs 3D culture reveals differences in AKT-mTOR-S6K signaling and drug responses.', 'Lipogenic enzymes as therapeutic targets for obesity and diabetes.', 'Pharmacological inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN)--catalyzed endogenous fatty acid biogenesis: a new family of anti-cancer agents?', ""Let's Go 3D!

Objective:   Primary objective was to compare and evaluate an MRI pathway and a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSGB) pathway in biopsy-naïve men with prostate-specific antigen levels of ≥3ng/ml.  Design, setting, and population:   A prospective, multicenter, powered, comparative effectiveness study included 626 biopsy-naïve patients (from February 2015 to February 2018).  Intervention:   All patients underwent prebiopsy mpMRI followed by systematic TRUSGB. Men with suspicious lesions on mpMRI also underwent MRGB prior to TRUSGB. MRGB was performed using the in-bore approach.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was defined as grade group ≥2 (Gleason score ≥3+4) in any core. The main secondary objectives were the number of men who could avoid biopsy after nonsuspicious mpMRI, the number of biopsy cores taken, and oncologic follow-up. Differences in proportions were tested using McNemar's test with adjusted Wald confidence intervals for differences of proportions with matched pairs.  Results and limitations:   The MRI pathway detected csPCa in 159/626 (25%) patients and insignificant prostate cancer (insignPCa) in 88/626 patients (14%). TRUSGB detected csPCa in 146/626 patients (23%) and insignPCa in 155/626 patients (25%). Relative sensitivity of the MRI pathway versus the TRUSGB pathway was 1.09 for csPCa (p=0.17) and 0.57 for insignPCa (p<0.0001). The total number of biopsy cores reduced from 7512 to 849 (-89%). The MRI pathway enabled biopsy avoidance in 309/626 (49%) patients due to nonsuspicious mpMRI. Immediate TRUSGB detected csPCa in only 3% (10/309) of these patients, increasing to 4% (13/309) with 1-yr follow-up. At the same time, TRUSGB would overdetect insignPCa in 20% (63/309). ""Focal saturation"" by four additional perilesional cores to MRGB improved the detection of csPCa in 21/317 (7%) patients. Compared with the literature, our proportion of nonsuspicious mpMRI cases is significantly higher (27-36% vs 49%) and that of equivocal cases is lower (15-28% vs 6%). This is probably due to the high-quality standard in this study. Therefore, a limitation is the duplication of these results in less experienced centers.  Conclusions:   In biopsy-naïve men, the MRI pathway compared with the TRUSGB pathway results in an identical detection rate of csPCa, with significantly fewer insignPCa cases. In this high-quality standard study, almost half of men have nonsuspicious MRI, which is higher compared with other studies. Not performing TRUS biopsy is at the cost of missing csPCa only in 4%.  Patient summary:   We compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MRI-guided biopsy against standard transrectal ultrasound biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in biopsy-naïve men. Our results show that patients can benefit from MRI because biopsy may be omitted in half of men, and fewer indolent cancers are detected, without compromising the detection of harmful disease. Men also need fewer needles to make a diagnosis.""","""['Marloes van der Leest', 'Erik Cornel', 'Bas Israël', 'Rianne Hendriks', 'Anwar R Padhani', 'Martijn Hoogenboom', 'Patrik Zamecnik', 'Dirk Bakker', 'Anglita Yanti Setiasti', 'Jeroen Veltman', 'Huib van den Hout', 'Hans van der Lelij', 'Inge van Oort', 'Sjoerd Klaver', 'Frans Debruyne', 'Michiel Sedelaar', 'Gerjon Hannink', 'Maroeska Rovers', 'Christina Hulsbergen-van de Kaa', 'Jelle O Barentsz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['In-bore Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy: As Good as it Gets?', 'Editorial Comment: Head-to-head Comparison of Transrectal Ultra-soundguided Prostate Biopsy Versus Multiparame-tric Prostate Resonance Imaging with Subsequent Magnetic Resonanceguided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men with Elevated Prostatespecific Antigen: A Large Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study.', 'Prospective study of diagnostic accuracy comparing prostate cancer detection by transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy versus magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with subsequent MR-guided biopsy in men without previous prostate biopsies.', 'Three-Tesla magnetic resonance-guided prostate biopsy in men with increased prostate-specific antigen and repeated, negative, random, systematic, transrectal ultrasound biopsies: detection of clinically significant prostate cancers.', 'Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in Biopsy-naive Men with Suspected Prostate Cancer Based on Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen Values: Results from a Randomized Prospective Blinded Controlled Trial.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

Therefore, addition of mpMRI to clinical parameters might improve the prediction of extraprostatic extension (EPE) in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens.  Objective:   To investigate the accuracy of a novel risk model (RM) combining clinical and mpMRI parameters to predict EPE in RP specimens.  Design, setting, and participants:   We added prebiopsy mpMRI to clinical parameters and developed an RM to predict individual side-specific EPE (EPE-RM). Clinical parameters of 264 consecutive men with mpMRI prior to MRI/transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy and subsequent RP between 2012 and 2015 were retrospectively analysed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariate regression analyses were used to determine significant EPE predictors for RM development. The prediction performance of the novel EPE-RM was compared with clinical T stage (cT), MR-European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) classification for EPE, two established nomograms (by Steuber et al and Ohori et al) and a clinical nomogram based on the coefficients of the established nomograms, and was constructed based on the data of the present cohort, using receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). For comparison, models' likelihood ratio (LR) tests and Vuong tests were used. Discrimination and calibration of the EPE-RM were validated based on resampling methods using bootstrapping.  Results and limitations:   International society of Urogenital Pathology grade on biopsy, ESUR criteria, prostate-specific antigen, cT, prostate volume, and capsule contact length were included in the EPE-RM. Calibration of the EPE-RM was good (error 0.018). The ROC area under the curve for the EPE-RM was larger (0.87) compared with cT (0.66), Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram (0.73), Steuber nomogram (0.70), novel clinical nomogram (0.79), and ESUR classification (0.81). Based on LR and Vuong tests, the EPE-RM's model fit was significantly better than that of cT, all clinical models, and ESUR classification alone (p<0.001). Limitations include monocentric design and expert reading of MRI.  Conclusions:   This novel EPE-RM, incorporating clinical and MRI parameters, performed better than contemporary clinical RMs and MRI predictors, therefore providing an accurate patient-tailored preoperative risk stratification of side-specific EPE.  Patient summary:   Extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer can be predicted accurately using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging and clinical parameters.

However, to date, little attention has been given to the impact of sexual assault on cancer screening behaviors, particularly among men. To address this, we used data from the 2014 Kansas Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. This survey is conducted annually via telephone. Logistic regressions were used to calculate odds of ever engaging (i.e., lifetime) in specific screening behaviors (clinical breast exam [CBE], mammogram, Pap test, colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, fecal occult blood test and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] test) and current compliance with cancer screening recommendations (CBE, mammogram, Pap test, colorectal cancer screening, and PSA test), with lifetime sexual assault as the independent variables. Colorectal cancer screening models were stratified by gender. All models adjusted for confounders. Sexual assault was associated with lower odds of ever receiving a PSA test and, for women, higher odds of ever receiving a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. Sexual assault was associated with lower odds of current compliance with CBE, mammogram, Pap test, and PSA test screening recommendations. A history of sexual assault was associated with lower odds of current compliance with cancer screening procedures, with the notable exception of colorectal cancer screening. Less consistent patterns were seen for lifetime screenings. Results suggest that alternatives to currently recommended procedures (like self-collection of HPV [human papilloma virus] DNA) or modified screening procedures may be a promising route to increase current compliance with cancer screening among a population that may avoid these procedures due to pain or fear of retraumatization.""","""['Héctor E Alcalá', 'Jessica Keim-Malpass', 'Emma M Mitchell']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Interpers Violence""","""['Heterogeneous impacts: adverse childhood experiences and cancer screening.', 'Screening men for prostate and colorectal cancer in the United States: does practice reflect the evidence?', 'Gender Identity Disparities in Cancer Screening Behaviors.', 'Accuracy of self-reported cancer-screening histories: a meta-analysis.', 'Predictors of screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostatic cancer among community-based primary care practices.', 'HPV screening in the urine of transpeople - A prevalence study.', 'Cancer risk perception and physician communication behaviors on cervical cancer and colorectal cancer screening.', 'Trauma and cervical cancer screening among women experiencing homelessness: A call for trauma-informed care.']"""
