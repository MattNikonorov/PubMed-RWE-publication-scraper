A new series of functionalized spirooxindole linked with 3-acylindole scaffold is reported, starting from chalcones derived from 3-acetyl indole with isatin, and l-4-thiazolidinecarboxylic acid. The reactions proceeded regioselectivity, stereoselectivity, without side products in high yield (71-89%). The new spirooxindole hybrids have been evaluated in vitro for their antiproliferative effects against colon cancer (HCT-116), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and prostate cancer (PC-3). The selectivity of their activity was evaluated. Some of the synthesized compounds showed considerable anticancer activities. Compound 4k proved to retain a high cytotoxic activity and selectivity against colon cancer cells HCT-116 (IC50 = 7 ± 0.27 µM, SI: 3.7), and HepG2 (IC50 = 5.5 ± 0.2 µM, SI: 4.7) in comparison to (IC50 = 12.6 ± 0.5, SI: 0.4 and 5.5 ± 0.3 µM, SI: 0.9, respectively). Compound 4k was less active (IC50 = 6 ± 0.3 µM, SI: 4.3) than cisplatin (IC50 = 5 ± 0.56 µM, SI: 1.0) but showed greater selectivity towards prostate cancer cells PC-3 in comparison to cisplatin. The details of the binding mode of the active compounds were clarified by molecular docking. Ligand Efficiency (LE) and Ligand Lipophilic Efficiency (LLE) were evaluated and revealed that compound 4k had acceptable value.""","""['Mohammad Shahidul Islam', 'Hussien Mansur Ghawas', 'Fardous F El-Senduny', 'Abdullah Mohammed Al-Majid', 'Yaseen A M M Elshaier', 'Farid A Badria', 'Assem Barakat']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Bioorg Chem""","""['Molecular hybridization design and synthesis of novel spirooxindole-based MDM2 inhibitors endowed with BCL2 signaling attenuation; a step towards the next generation p53 activators.', 'Stereoselective Synthesis of the Di-Spirooxindole Analogs Based Oxindole and Cyclohexanone Moieties as Potential Anticancer Agents.', 'Synthesis of novel spirooxindole-pyrrolidines and evaluation of their cytotoxic activity.', 'Spiro-oxindoles as a Promising Class of Small Molecule Inhibitors of p53-MDM2 Interaction Useful in Targeted Cancer Therapy.', 'Reliability of Click Chemistry on Drug Discovery: A Personal Account.', 'Optimized spirooxindole-pyrazole hybrids targeting the p53-MDM2 interplay induce apoptosis and synergize with doxorubicin in A549 cells.', ""Novel Functionalized Spiro Indoline-3,5'-pyrroline-2,2'dione Derivatives: Synthesis, Characterization, Drug-Likeness, ADME, and Anticancer Potential."", 'Spirooxindole: A Versatile Biologically Active Heterocyclic Scaffold.', 'Synthesis, Characterization, and Cytotoxicity of New Spirooxindoles Engrafted Furan Structural Motif as a Potential Anticancer Agent.', 'Design, Synthesis and In Vitro Evaluation of Spirooxindole-Based Phenylsulfonyl Moiety as a Candidate Anti-SAR-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV-2 with the Implementation of Combination Studies.']"""

The study was performed as a side questionnaire to the annual Global Prevalence Study of Infections in Urology (GPIU) between 2006 and 2009. Patients that had undergone TURP were eligible. Baseline data about hospitals and patients were collected. The questionnaire contained questions regarding preoperative microbiological investigations, catheter care and performance of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. A total of 825 men were included from 138 participating centres from Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. Only 50.1% of the patients received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis with a median duration of 3 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 1-7 days). Preoperative urine culture was taken in 59.2%. The catheter was replaced in 1 week prior to the surgery only in 38.3% of cases.

Using data from the UK Biobank (UKB), we evaluate whether genetically predicted 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with overall cancer susceptibility and cancer mortality using five 25(OH)D genetic markers. Data comprised 438 870 white British UKB participants aged 37-73, including 46 155 cancer cases and 6998 cancer-specific deaths. Participants with keratinocyte cancers and/or benign tumors were excluded from the analysis. Odds ratios were calculated per 20 nmol/L increase in genetically predicted 25(OH)D for cancer risk and cancer mortality. For individual cancer risks, estimates were meta-analyzed with publicly available data using a fixed-effect inverse-variance-weighted model. We demonstrated that genetically low plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were not associated with increased cancer risk nor cancer mortality. Stratification by sex or cancer types did not reveal any meaningful differences albeit wider confidence intervals. Fixed-effect meta-analysis of our individual cancer risk estimates with those derived from publicly available cancer consortia data and previous studies further reinforced our null Mendelian randomization findings on prostate, lung, colorectal and breast cancers with tight confidence intervals; for ovarian and pancreatic cancers, our estimates were less precise despite being not statistically significant. Taken altogether, our results provide no genetic evidence for an association between vitamin D and overall cancer outcomes, with tight confidence intervals to exclude all but very small effect sizes.""","""['Jue-Sheng Ong', 'Puya Gharahkhani', 'Jiyuan An', 'Matthew H Law', 'David C Whiteman', 'Rachel E Neale', 'Stuart MacGregor']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Hum Mol Genet""","""['Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review of Mendelian Randomization Studies.', 'Circulating vitamin D concentration and risk of seven cancers: Mendelian randomisation study.', 'Relationship between Serum 25(OH)D and Depression: Causal Evidence from a Bi-Directional Mendelian Randomization Study.', 'Association between coffee consumption and overall risk of being diagnosed with or dying from cancer among >300 000 UK Biobank participants in a large-scale Mendelian randomization study.', 'Vitamin D concentration, obesity, and risk of diabetes: a mendelian randomisation study.', 'Efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation on cancer mortality: Systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.', 'Vitamin D, Menopausal Health and COVID-19: Critical Appraisal of Current Data.', 'Association of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with risk of overall and colorectal cancer among Japanese using a Mendelian randomization approach.', 'Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review of Mendelian Randomization Studies.', 'Investigating Causal Associations of Circulating Micronutrients Concentrations with the Risk of Lung Cancer: A Mendelian Randomization Study.']"""

We studied 356 paraffin-embedded tissues from unrelated Mexican men with PCa or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), with the latter serving as control. HPV detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal primers, and viral genotypes were detected using sequencing or multiplex PCR. Light microscopy analyses enabled the identification of koilocytes in samples subsequently analyzed for HPV detection by in situ PCR and for p16-INK4A expression by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that high risk- (HR) HPVs were detected in 37/189 (19.6%) PCa specimens compared to 16/167 (9.6%) of BHP specimens (odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI= 1.2 to 4.3; p=0.01). These data suggest HR-HPV may play a role in PCa. HPV 52 and 58 were the most frequent genotypes (33 and 17%, respectively) detected in the population studied. Koilocytes were detected in all in situ PCR-HPV-positive samples, representing a pathognomonic feature of infection, and we observed the overexpression of p16-INK4A in HPV-positive samples compared to HPV-negative samples, indirectly suggesting the presence of HR-HPV E7 oncoprotein.

Among these factors, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the single factor most consistently associated with the prediction of positive F-FCH PET/CT. In this study, we wished to confirm this finding and expand it in a large series of patients.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 192 patients with prostate cancer who were recruited from the Nuclear Medicine Department of the Sant'Andrea Hospital of La Spezia, Italy, from March 2013 to March 2018 and who underwent F-FCH PET/CT owing to biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Median trigger PSA was 2.57 ng/ml. The overall positive detection rate of F-FCH PET/CT was 60.9%. The percent of positive scans was 30.5% for PSA less than 1 ng/ml, 59.4% (38/64) for PSA between 1 and 5 ng/ml, and 88.4% for PSA greater than 5 ng/ml (P<0.001). On univariate regression analysis, high PSA levels, biochemical failure during antiandrogenic therapy at the time of PET/CT, and older age significantly (P<0.05) predicted positive F-FCH PET/CT result. On multivariate regression analysis, only high PSA levels and biochemical failure during antiandrogenic therapy maintained the statistical significance (P<0.05). However, when the analysis was restricted to patients with PSA less than 1 ng/ml, PSA lost the statistical significance. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.795. The PSA cutoff value that best distinguished PET/CT-positive from PET/CT-negative patients was 2.57 ng/ml. Sensitivity and specificity at this PSA value were 66.7 and 76.0%, respectively.  Conclusion:   This study confirms that PSA robustly predicts positive PET/CT result with radiolabeled choline. Unfortunately, this study also confirms the limited sensitivity of F-FCH PET/CT for PSA less than 1 ng/ml, which currently represents the weakest point of the technique.""","""['Giampiero Giovacchini', 'Elisabetta Giovannini', 'Elisa Borsò', 'Patrizia Lazzeri', 'Mattia Riondato', 'Rossella Leoncini', 'Valerio Duce', 'Enrico Conti', 'Maria Picchio', 'Andrea Ciarmiello']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['Oligometastatic recurrent prostate cancer detects by fluorine-18-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography in patients with prostate-specific antigen levels of up to 5\u2009ng/ml.', 'Influence of trigger PSA and PSA kinetics on 11C-Choline PET/CT detection rate in patients with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prospective Comparison of 18F-Fluoromethylcholine Versus 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients Who Have Rising PSA After Curative Treatment and Are Being Considered for Targeted Therapy.', 'Acquisition with (11)C-choline and (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT for patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Imaging of Prostate Cancer Using 18F-Choline PET/Computed Tomography.', 'The Diagnostic Role of 18F-Choline, 18F-Fluciclovine and 18F-PSMA PET/CT in the Detection of Prostate Cancer With Biochemical Recurrence: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

The aim of this work was to present a simple automatic QC for prostate 1 H MRSI that can handle data obtained with different commonly used pulse sequences, echo times, field strengths, and MR platforms.  Methods:   A QC method was developed with a ratio (Qratio) where the numerator and the denominator are functions of several signal heights, logically combined for their positive or negative contribution to spectral quality. This Qratio was tested on 4 data sets obtained at 1.5, 3, and 7T, with and without endorectal coil and different localization sequences and echo times. Spectra of 25,248 voxels in 26 prostates were labeled as acceptable or unacceptable by MRS experts as gold standard. A threshold value was determined for Qratio from a subset of voxels, labeled in consensus by 4 experts, for an optimal accuracy to separate spectra.  Results:   Applying this Qratio threshold to the remaining test voxels, an automatic separation of good and bad spectra was possible with an accuracy of 0.88, similar to manual separation between the 2 classes. Qratio values were used to generate maps representing spectral quality on a binary or continuous scale.  Conclusion:   Automated QC of prostate 1 H MRSI by Qratio is fast, simple, easily transferable and more practical than supervised feature extraction methods and therefore easy to integrate into different clinical MR systems. Moreover, quality maps can be generated to read the reliability of spectra in each voxel.""","""['Nassim Tayari', 'Jiri Obels', 'Thiele Kobus', 'Tom W J Scheenen', 'Arend Heerschap']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Magn Reson Med""","""['High-Quality 3-Dimensional 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of the Prostate Without Endorectal Receive Coil Using A Semi-LASER Sequence.', 'Impact of an endorectal coil for 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the prostate at 3.0T in comparison to 1.5T: Do we need an endorectal coil?', '(1)H MR spectroscopic imaging of the prostate at 7T using spectral-spatial pulses.', 'Metabolite ratios in 1H MR spectroscopic imaging of the prostate.', 'In\xa0vivo MR spectroscopic imaging of the prostate, from application to interpretation.', 'Developments in proton MR spectroscopic imaging of prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   This was a prospective, open, randomized controlled study.  Inclusion criteria:   male patients; pathologically diagnosed as mid-low rectal adenocarcinoma; distance from tumor lower edge to anal margin ≤10 cm; standard radical surgery for rectal cancer, including intestinal resection and regional lymph node dissection.  Exclusion criteria:   previous history of benign prostatic hyperplasia or history of prostate surgery; bladder dysfunction such as dysuria and urinary retention before surgery; local resection of rectal tumor or extended resection. According to the above criteria, 92 patients who underwent colorectal surgery at the Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University from June to December 2016 were prospectively included. The patients were randomly divided into bladder training group (n=43) and bladder non-training group (n=49) according to the random number table method. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University (ethical approval number: 2016KY005) and registered with the China Clinical Trial Registration Center (ChiCTR) (registration No.ChiCTR-IOR-16007995). The implementation of patient's treatment measures, the data collection and analysis were based on the three-blind principle, using envelopes for distribution concealment. In the bladder training group, bladder training was routinely performed from the first day after operation to catheter removal, and in bladder non-training group the catheter was kept open till its removal. The catheter was removed in the early morning at the 5th day after surgery, and the spontaneous urine output was recorded and the residual urine volume of the bladder was measured after the first urination. The international prostate symptom score (IPSS) was applied to evaluate the patient's urinary function before and after surgery.  Results:   The age of whole group was (58.6±10.9) years old, the body mass index was (22.4±2.7) kg/m 2, and the distance from tumor lower edge to anal margin was (6.5±1.9) cm. The baseline data, such as age, body mass index, distance from tumor lower edge to anal margin, preoperative IPSS score, preoperative bladder residual urine volume, neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, preventive ileostomy and surgical procedure were not significantly different between two groups (all P>0.05). There was no significant difference in IPSS scores evaluated at the second day (3.6±4.0 vs. 3.5±3.4, t=0.128, P=0.899) and one month (3.7±2.9 vs. 3.0±3.1, t=1.113, P=0.269) after catheter removal between the bladder training group and bladder non-training group. No significant difference in the postoperative residual urine volume of bladder (media 44 ml vs. 24 ml, Z=-1.466, P=0.143), the first spontaneous urination volume (median 200 ml vs. 150 ml, Z=-1.228, P=0.219) after catheter removal, and postoperative hospital stay [(8.2±4.5) days vs. (9.1±5.5) days, t=-0.805, P=0.423] was found. Urinary infection rate was 20.9%(9/43) in the training group, which was even higher than 8.2%(4/49) in the non-training group, but the difference was not significant(χ²=3.077, P=0.079). No patient needed re-catheterization in either group.

Objective:   Our objective was to examine whether football in a real-world setting (i.e., local football clubs) was safe and feasible in practice and could improve quality of life, mitigate decline in muscle mass and bone density, and increase fat mass in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this pragmatic, multicentre, parallel randomized controlled trial, men diagnosed with prostate cancer were recruited from five Danish urological departments. Men (N = 214) diagnosed with prostate cancer were randomly allocated, using random generated lists (block size 4-8) stratified for center and androgen-deprivation therapy status, to either 1 h of football twice weekly in a local football club or to usual care, which was a 15- to 30-min telephone session covering their options for physical activity or free-of-charge rehabilitation delivered as standard in Denmark. Allocation was concealed from the trial investigator performing the randomization, but-given the nature of the intervention-this was not possible for personnel and participants. Assessments were performed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months. The primary outcome was mean change difference in prostate cancer-specific quality of life at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were body composition, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) physical and mental health, and safety-reported as fractures, falls, and serious adverse events.  Results:   Attrition was 1 and 3% at 12 weeks, and 5% and 5% at 6 months for the usual care and football groups, respectively. Prostate cancer-specific quality of life was equal between groups at 12 weeks (mean difference + 1.9 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.0-4.8; P = 0.20) and at 6 months (+ 0.5 points, 95% CI -2.8-3.8; P = 0.76). Fractures were equally distributed, with two fractures in the usual care group and one in the football group. Likewise, body composition outcomes were equal. Mental health improved after 6 months of football (mean difference + 2.7 points, 95% CI 0.8-4.6; P = 0.006).  Conclusions:   In this trial, community-based football was a feasible exercise strategy for men with prostate cancer.

Experiments on data from 19 patients provided for the public by the Initiative for Collaborative Computer Vision Benchmarking (I2CVB) show that our approach outperforms traditional pattern recognition and machine learning approaches by a significant margin. Particularly, for the task of cancer detection and localization, the system achieves an average AUC of 0.995, an accuracy of 0.894, and a recall of 0.928.

Treatment of prostate cancer requires androgen deprivation surgery or therapy to prevent metastases and alleviate pain. Recently, six DNA vaccines have entered clinical trials against prostate cancer in humans with limited success. There is a need for new therapies that delay the establishment of malignancy and prolong survival.  Materials and methods:   A plasmid DNA vaccine coding for eight gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH-I) interspersed in eight T-helper epitopes was used. Sexually mature male mice were immunized with the vaccine in hemagglutinating virus of Japanese envelope vector and boosted in nonionized surfactant vesicles in study weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Plasma anti-GnRH-I antibody response, serum testosterone concentration, and effect on prostate were evaluated.  Results:   Results of an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed anti-GnRH-I antibody response (OD value) detected in the study week 3 (0.613 ± 0.179) with a highest response in the week 12 (1.205 ± 0.219). Serum testosterone concentration (ng/ml) in vaccinated mice was significantly reduced (P > 0.000, 0.761 ± 0.531) in the study week 24 in contrast to control serum (7.583 ± 1.251). Group average gross combined weight of prostate and seminal vesicles of vaccinated mice was significantly (P < 0.000) reduced in the study week 24 (319.75 ± 89.19 mg) in contrast to control weight (563.25 ± 108.60 mg). Sections of prostate stained with Goldner's trichrome showed profuse pink color secretion in control tubules, which however was absent in the vaccinated prostate. The lining epithelium of the vaccinated prostate was atrophied and did not enfold in its lumen.  Conclusions:   Immunization strategy designed with the plasmid DNA vaccine in hemagglutinating virus of Japanese envelope and nonionized surfactant vesicles can be the genetic immunization platform. This vaccine bears potentials in terms of reducing serum testosterone concentration and induction of atrophy of prostate. Targeted ablation of native GnRH-I by genetic immunization could offer leverage to vaccinologists, seeking therapeutic target to control and prevent malignancy of prostate.""","""['Umme K Rima', 'Abu S M Bari', 'Mohammad Z Hossain', 'Mohammad A H Khan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate Int""","""['Immunisation of male mice with a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH-I) and T-helper epitopes suppresses fertility in vivo.', 'Immunisation with a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH-I) and T-helper epitopes in saline suppresses rodent fertility.', 'Vaccines for control of fertility and hormone dependent cancers.', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigen S Gene is an Effective Carrier Molecule for Developing GnRH DNA Immunocastration Vaccine in Mice.', 'Developments in the control of testicular function.', 'Protective roles of vitamin C and 5-aminosalicylic acid on reproduction in acrylamide intoxicated male mice.']"""

Materials and methods:   DU145, PC3, and LNCaP cells were treated with various concentrations of paclitaxel, naringin, and their combinations. Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), image-based cytometer, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blot, and transwell assay were used to evaluate cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle, the mRNA expression, protein expression, and cell migration, respectively.  Results:   Naringin treatment inhibited cell survival in a dose- and time-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Among the pathways evaluated, naringin (150 μM) significantly induced the mRNA expressions of BAX, BID, caspase 3, cytochrome c, p53, p21 Cip1 , and p27 Kip1 and downregulated the expressions of survivin and livin in DU145 cells. The combination of naringin and paclitaxel treatments synergistically increased the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel in androgen-independent DU145 and PC3 cells, as well as in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. The combination of naringin with docetaxel has almost the same inhibitory effect on cell proliferation as the paclitaxel combination in androgen-independent cells, whereas there is no similar effect in LNCaP cells. Naringin exhibits significant inhibitory effects on the cell migration ability. The flavonoid either alone or in combination with paclitaxel therapy resulted in an increase in tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) protein expression and decrease in nuclear factor-κB p50 protein level in DU145 cells.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, naringin acts as a chemosensitizer which synergistically strengths the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel in PCa cells. Therefore, naringin therapy alone or in combination with paclitaxel may be useful in the treatment of PCa.

However, due to natural processes and anthropogenic activities, various pollutants have been added to the ground water system. Among these, heavy metals are some of the most serious pollutants. Cd, a toxic heavy metal used in Ni-Cd batteries, the colouration of plastic and various discarded electronic products released into the water system causes serious health issues. The chronic exposure to Cd produces a wide variety of acute and chronic effects in humans. Cd accumulates in the human body, especially in the kidneys, resulting in kidney damage (renal tubular damage), which is a critical health effect. Other effects of Cd exposure are disturbances in calcium metabolism, hypercalciuria and the formation of kidney stones. High exposure to Cd can lead to lung cancer and prostate cancer; hence, poor quality water that may result in Cd toxicity has become a global concern. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the concentration of Cd in underground water sources in western U.P. regions. Water samples were acidified to 1% with nitric acid and then stored in double-capped polyethylene bottles for further analysis by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. After comparing the data to the WHO (2011) permissible limit, the study revealed that the concentration of Cd was higher than the regulatory threshold; therefore, the underground water system is seriously affected by Cd toxicity.""","""['Nida Idrees', 'B Tabassum', 'Elsayed Fathi Abd Allah', 'Abeer Hashem', 'Robeena Sarah', 'Mohammad Hashim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Saudi J Biol Sci""","""['Mercury, arsenic, lead and cadmium in waters of the Singrauli coal mining and power plants industrial zone, Central East India.', 'Heavy Metal Contamination in Groundwater around Industrial Estate vs Residential Areas in Coimbatore, India.', 'Sources, pathways, and relative risks of contaminants in surface water and groundwater: a perspective prepared for the Walkerton inquiry.', 'Evaluation of surface water quality indices and ecological risk assessment for heavy metals in scrap yard neighbourhood.', 'Heavy metal poisoning: the effects of cadmium on the kidney.', 'Evidences for the augmented Cd(II) biosorption by Cd(II) resistant strain Candida tropicalis XTA1874 from contaminated aqueous medium.', 'Sample Preparation and Analytical Techniques in the Determination of Trace Elements in Food: A Review.', 'Developing Toxic Metal Environmental Justice Indices (TM-EJIs) for Arsenic, Cadmium, Lead, and Manganese Contamination in Private Drinking Wells in North Carolina.', 'Deciphering Cadmium (Cd) Tolerance in Newly Isolated Bacterial Strain, Ochrobactrum intermedium BB12, and Its Role in Alleviation of Cd Stress in Spinach Plant (Spinacia oleracea L.).', 'Poly (Amidehydrazide) Hydrogel Particles for Removal of Cu2+ and Cd2+ Ions from Water.']"""

We aimed to assess the effect on surgical margins and degree of nerve sparing of a pelvic MRI presented at a preoperative MRI conference.  Methods:   Single institution, observational cohort study including 1037 men that underwent robot assisted radical prostatectomy between October 2013 and June 2015. Of these, 557 underwent a preoperative MRI combined with a preoperative MRI conference and 410 did not. With whole-mount prostate specimen histopathology as gold standard we assessed the ability of MRI in finding the index tumor and the sensitivity and specificity for extra prostatic extension. We calculated relative risks for positive surgical margins and non-nerve sparing procedure, adjusting for preoperative risk factors using stabilized inverse-probability weighting.  Results:   MRI detected the index tumor in 80% of the cases. Non-organ confined disease (pT3) at histology was present in the MRI and the non-MRI group in 42% and 24%, respectively. Rate of positive surgical margins comparing the MRI and non-MRI groups was 26.7% and 33.7%, respectively, relative risk 0.79 [95% CI 0.65-0.96], weighted relative risk (wRR) 0.69 [95% CI 0.55-0.86]. The wRR of extensive positive surgical margins was 0.45 [95% CI 0.31-0.67]. Undergoing MRI was also associated with an increased risk of being operated with a non-nerve sparing technique (wRR, 1.84 [95% CI 1.11-3.03]).

The aim of this study is to investigate how psychologic depression alters the immune profiles in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   We used a murine model of depression in Myc-CaP tumor-bearing immunocompetent FVB mice and Hi-myc mice presenting with spontaneous prostate cancer. Transwell migration and coculture assays were used to evaluate myeloid cell trafficking and cytokine profile changes evoked by Myc-CaP cells that had been treated with norepinephrine (NE), a major elevated neurotransmitter in depression. Chemoattractant, which correlated with immune cell infiltration, was screened by RNA-seq. The chemoattractant and immune cell infiltration were further confirmed using clinical samples of patients with prostate cancer with a high score of psychologic depression.  Results:   Psychologic depression predominantly promoted tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) intratumor infiltrations, which resulted from spleen and circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell mobilization. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) released from NE-treated Myc-CaP cells promotes macrophage trafficking and IL6 releasing, which activates STAT3 signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells. Clinical specimens from patients with prostate cancer with higher score of depression revealed higher CD68+ TAM infiltration and stronger NPY and IL6 expression.  Conclusions:   Depression promotes myeloid cell infiltration and increases IL6 levels by a sympathetic-NPY signal. Sympathetic-NPY inhibition may be a promising strategy for patients with prostate cancer with high score of psychologic depression.See related commentary by Mohammadpour et al., p. 2363.""","""['Yan Cheng#', 'Xin-Ying Tang#', 'Yi-Xuan Li#', 'Dan-Dan Zhao', 'Qiu-Hua Cao', 'Hong-Xi Wu', 'Hong-Bao Yang', 'Kun Hao', 'Yong Yang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Depression Stresses the Immune Response and Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth.', 'Depression Stresses the Immune Response and Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth.', 'TLR9 expression and secretion of LIF by prostate cancer cells stimulates accumulation and activity of polymorphonuclear MDSCs.', 'Neuropeptide Y Y5-receptor activation on breast cancer cells acts as a paracrine system that stimulates VEGF expression and secretion to promote angiogenesis.', 'Myeloid-derived cells in prostate cancer progression: phenotype and prospective therapies.', 'Modulatory actions of neuropeptide Y on prostate cancer growth: role of MAP kinase/ERK 1/2 activation.', 'Chronic stress accelerates glioblastoma progression via DRD2/ERK/β-catenin axis and Dopamine/ERK/TH positive feedback loop.', 'Chronic stress in solid tumor development: from mechanisms to interventions.', 'Ultrasensitive and Cost-Effective Detection of Neuropeptide-Y by a Disposable Immunosensor: A New Functionalization Route for Indium-Tin Oxide Surface.', 'Stress and cancer: The mechanisms of immune dysregulation and management.', 'Neuroendocrine regulations in tissue-specific immunity: From mechanism to applications in tumor.']"""

In this study, we demonstrate that IFNγ can induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer cells via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) such as IFN-induced tetratricopeptide repeat 5 (IFIT5). We unveil a new function of IFIT5 complex in degrading precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNA) that includes pre-miR-363 from the miR-106a-363 cluster as well as pre-miR-101 and pre-miR-128, who share a similar 5'-end structure with pre-miR-363. These suppressive miRNAs exerted a similar function by targeting EMT transcription factors in prostate cancer cells. Depletion of IFIT5 decreased IFNγ-induced cell invasiveness in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. IFIT5 was highly elevated in high-grade prostate cancer and its expression inversely correlated with these suppressive miRNAs. Altogether, this study unveils a prometastatic role of the IFNγ pathway via a new mechanism of action, which raises concerns about its clinical application.Significance: A unique IFIT5-XRN1 complex involved in the turnover of specific tumor suppressive microRNAs is the underlying mechanism of IFNγ-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.See related commentary by Liu and Gao, p. 1032.""","""['U-Ging Lo', 'Rey-Chen Pong', 'Diane Yang', 'Leah Gandee', 'Elizabeth Hernandez', 'Andrew Dang', 'Chung-Jung Lin', 'John Santoyo', 'Shihong Ma', 'Rajni Sonavane', 'Jun Huang', 'Shu-Fen Tseng', 'Loredana Moro', 'Arnaldo A Arbini', 'Payal Kapur', 'Ganesh V Raj', 'Dalin He', 'Chih-Ho Lai', 'Ho Lin', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['IFNγ, a Double-Edged Sword in Cancer Immunity and Metastasis.', 'IFNγ, a Double-Edged Sword in Cancer Immunity and Metastasis.', 'MicroRNA-92a promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition through activation of PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer metastasis.', 'Hypoxic BMSC-derived exosomal miRNAs promote metastasis of lung cancer cells via STAT3-induced EMT.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Cancer Stem Cells in Recurrent and Drug-Resistant Lung Cancer.', 'Unpacking the Complexity of Epithelial Plasticity: From Master Regulator Transcription Factors to Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Inflammatory Networks in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'How Different Pathologies Are Affected by IFIT Expression.', 'Crosstalk of Inflammatory Cytokines within the Breast Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Harnessing epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity to boost cancer immunotherapy.']"""

Methods:   Energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII) scores were computed among 40,161 participants in the California Men's Health Study. Over 9.7 ± 3.8 years of follow-up, 2707 incident prostate cancer cases were diagnosed and categorized as low-, intermediate-, or high-risk, based on disease grade and stage. Accelerated failure-time models assessed time to diagnosis of prostate cancer. Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Nonlinear effects of E-DII were modeled as third-order polynomials.  Results:   Time to prostate cancer diagnosis did not differ by E-DII quartile. The HR for high-risk prostate cancer increased in the third E-DII quartile (HRQ3 vs. Q1 = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.04-1.76), but not in the fourth (HRQ4 vs. Q1 = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.74-1.32, Ptrend = .74), suggesting a nonlinear dose-response. HR curves for prostate cancer increased exponentially above an E-DII threshold of ≈+3.0. HR curves for high-risk prostate cancer had a much steeper incline above an E-DII threshold of ≈+2.5. Curves were higher among Blacks and Whites relative to other races and among overweight or obese men. No relationship was observed between E-DII scores and intermediate- or low-risk disease.  Conclusions:   Relationships between proinflammatory diet and prostate cancer risk may be nonlinear, with an increased risk above an E-DII threshold of ≈+2.5.""","""['Daria M McMahon', 'James B Burch', 'James R Hébert', 'James W Hardin', 'Jiajia Zhang', 'Michael D Wirth', 'Shawn D Youngstedt', 'Nitin Shivappa', 'Steven J Jacobsen', 'Bette Caan', 'Stephen K Van Den Eeden']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Ann Epidemiol""","""['Increased Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) Is Associated With Increased Risk of Prostate Cancer in Jamaican Men.', 'Association between dietary inflammatory index and prostate cancer among Italian men.', 'Inflammatory potential of diet and risk of pancreatic cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Dietary inflammatory index and the risk of prostate cancer: a dose-response meta-analysis.', 'Review: prostate cancer epidemiology.', 'Postdiagnostic Inflammatory, Hyperinsulinemic, and Insulin-Resistant Diets and Lifestyles and the Risk of Prostate Cancer Progression and Mortality.', 'Dietary Inflammatory Index in relation to Type 2 Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Contribution of RAGE axis activation to the association between metabolic syndrome and cancer.', 'Inflammatory and Insulinemic Dietary Patterns: Influence on Circulating Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Risk.', 'Dietary Inflammatory Index and Non-Communicable Disease Risk: A Narrative Review.']"""

Both salvage LN dissection (sLND) and elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) are potential treatment options.  Objective:   To describe anatomic patterns of nodal oligorecurrent PCa in relation to different surgical and radiotherapy templates.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with biochemical recurrence following primary PCa treatment were eligible for 18F-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT). Patients with five or fewer LN recurrences (N1/M1a) were eligible for the current retrospective analysis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   All LN recurrences were mapped on a reference patient CT, as well as different surgical templates (limited to superextended) and an adapted version of the PIVOTAL ENRT template, blinded for the recurrences. Descriptive statistics were used to report recurrences in relation to the different templates and to compare LN coverage between templates.  Results and limitations:   In total, 158 LN recurrences (N1: 88; M1a: 70) in 82 patients (median age: 67yr; prostate-specific antigen [PSA]: 3.1ng/ml; PSA doubling time of 7.8mo at the time of clinical recurrence) were mapped. In 49% of patients, recurrences were exclusively located in the true pelvis, followed by the common iliac LN (10%), retroperitoneal/inguinal LN (10%), or a combination (31%). There was up to 40% volume overlap between ENRT and the surgical templates. Theoretically, with ENRT more patients are fully covered (p<0.02) and the total number of covered lesions is higher (p<0.001) when compared to all types of sLND, except for superextended sLND, which is comparable to ENRT (patient-level: p=0.6; lesion-level: p=0.09). With 22% of all 158 lesions located outside all templates (N1: 7%; M1a: 15%), at least 31% of all 82 patients would not be salvaged using any of the templates.  Conclusions:   More than half of nodal recurrences are located outside the true pelvis. Limited or standard extended sLND is considered insufficient as a salvage treatment approach and is thus not recommended for use. To maximize treatment outcomes for nodal recurrences, ENRT or superextended sLND should be preferred.  Patient summary:   We compared two possible treatment options, elective nodal radiotherapy and salvage lymph node dissection, for patients with prostate cancer recurrence limited to five or fewer lymph nodes and reported the nodal distrubution. Radiotherapy and surgery cover different areas with possible different outcomes.""","""['Aurélie De Bruycker', 'Elise De Bleser', 'Karel Decaestecker', 'Valérie Fonteyne', 'Nicolaas Lumen', 'Pieter De Visschere', 'Kathia De Man', 'Louke Delrue', 'Bieke Lambert', 'Piet Ost']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Aurélie De Bruycker, Elise De Bleser, Karel Decaestecker, et al.

The aim of this study was to assess the rate of anastomotic leakage (AL) after AR in these patients.  Methods:   All men who underwent bowel resection because of rectal cancer between 2000 and 2016 and had been diagnosed previously with prostate cancer were identified by linking the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry with the National Prostate Cancer Register. The medical records of men who underwent AR and had previously received radiotherapy for prostate cancer were reviewed.  Results:   In total, 13299 men had undergone a bowel resection for rectal cancer, 188 of whom had previously received radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Among those who had received radiation therapy, 59 men (31%) had an AR: 50 men (85%) received a diverting ileostomy, 42 men (71%) had an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 1-2 and 36 men (61%) had tumour stage 1-2. AL was found in 12/59 men (20%), one of whom had a re-laparotomy. There was no 90-day mortality.  Conclusions:   In the combined national population-based registries, a minority of patients with rectal cancer had an AR after previous radiotherapy for prostate cancer. These patients were healthy with early cancer stages and, in this selected group of patients, the AL rate was much lower than that reported previously.""","""['Ingvar Sverrisson', 'Folke Folkvaljon', 'Abbas Chabok', 'Pär Stattin', 'Kenneth Smedh', 'Maziar Nikberg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Surg Oncol""","""['High stoma prevalence and stoma reversal complications following anterior resection for rectal cancer: a population-based multicentre study.', 'Substantial underreporting of anastomotic leakage after anterior resection for rectal cancer in the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry.', 'Late leakage after anterior resection: a defunctioning stoma alters the clinical course of anastomotic leakage.', 'Delayed anastomotic leakage following laparoscopic intersphincteric resection for lower rectal cancer: report of four cases and literature review.', 'Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative risk factors for anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic low anterior resection with double stapling technique anastomosis.', 'Quantitative evaluation of anastomotic perfusion during colorectal surgery via indocyanine green fluorescence angiography: a narrative review.', 'Treatment of rectal cancer after previous prostate cancer: A single institution experience.', 'Left colic artery diameter is an important factor affecting anastomotic blood supply in sigmoid colon cancer or rectal cancer surgery: a pilot study.', 'The incidence, risk factors, and new prediction score for fluorescence abnormalities of near-infrared imaging using indocyanine green in laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer.', 'Does intraoperative indocyanine green fluorescence angiography decrease the incidence of anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery?

Previously reported results from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) screening trial had a median follow-up of 12 years. Whether the benefit is sustained over the long term and remains so in both sexes and all age groups is uncertain. We report long-term results after an additional 5 years of follow-up.  Methods:   Participants in the PLCO trial were recruited from the general population in the catchment areas of ten screening centres across the USA, without previous diagnosis of a prostate, lung, colorectal, or ovarian cancer or current cancer treatment. From 1993 to 2001, participants aged 55-74 years were randomly assigned to usual care or flexible sigmoidoscopy at baseline and again at 3 years or 5 years. Randomisation was done within blocks and stratified by centre, age, and sex. The primary endpoint was cause-specific mortality and secondary endpoints included incidence and tumour staging; cause of death was determined without knowledge of study arm. In this analysis, we assessed incidence and mortality rates overall, by time-period, and by combinations of sex, age at baseline (55-64 years/65-74 years), location (distal/proximal), and stage, on an intent-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00002540.  Findings:   After a median follow-up of 15·8 years (IQR 13·2-18·0) for incidence and 16·8 years (14·4-18·9) for mortality, the incidence of colorectal cancer was significantly lower in the intervention arm (1461 cases; 12·55 per 10 000 person-years) than with usual care (1761 cases; 15·33 per 10 000 person-years; relative risk [RR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·76-0·88). Similarly, mortality was lower in the intervention arm (417 deaths; 3·37 per 10 000 person-years) than the usual care arm (549; 4·48 per 10 000 person-years; RR 0·75, 95% CI 0·66-0·85). The reduction in mortality was limited to the distal colon, with no significant effect in the proximal colon. Reductions in incidence were significantly larger in men than women (pinteraction=0·04) and reductions in mortality were significantly larger in the older age group (65-74 years vs 55-64 years at baseline; pinteraction=0·01).  Interpretation:   Reductions in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality from flexible sigmoidoscopy screening are sustained over the long term. Differences by sex and age should be examined in other ongoing trials of colorectal cancer screening to help clarify if different screening strategies would achieve greater risk reduction.

Silymarin (SYL) has been reported for its anticarcinogenic activity against various types of cancer such as prostate, breast, ovary, colon, lung, bladder and liver. Due to poor solubility and low bioavailability SYL lacks satisfactory therapeutic value thus designing a suitable and effective delivery system of SYL can led to improved therapeutic potential. The present study was aimed to develop SYL-loaded dextrose (DEX) modified bilosomes for targeted delivery to HC cells. The DEX-modified bilosomes were prepared through thin-film hydration method and optimized employing Box Behnken design. The bilosomes were evaluated for percent entrapment, drug loading, in vitro release and cytotoxicity on Hep-G2 cells. The optimized DEX-SYL-BL exhibited a particle size of 219.3 ± 2.99 nm, percent entrapment of 62.32 ± 4.23%, drug loading of 34.56 ± 1.23% and 84.96 ± 2.76% drug release respectively over a period of 24 hr. The stability of bilosomes was ascertained in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. Cytotoxicity studies revealed greater performance of DEX-SYL-BL in terms of reduced viability in Hep-G2 cell lines when compared with pure SYL and SYL-BL. Further DEX-modified bilosomes were evaluated in vivo for their therapeutic efficacy in DEN-induced (Diethylnitrosamine) hepatic carcinoma in animal model. The DEX-SYL-BL displayed higher therapeutic potential as revealed from enhanced survival and reduced tumour burden in animals.

Methods:   We followed three cohorts using de-identified data from a random 10% sample of people registered for Australia's universal health care system: those aged 50-69 years ( n = 760,058) for colorectal cancer screening; women aged 18-69 years ( n = 918,140) for cervical cancer screening and men aged 50-69 years ( n = 380,238) for prostate cancer screening. We used Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between severe mental illness and rates of faecal occult blood testing, pap smears and prostate-specific antigen testing.  Results:   Having severe mental illness was associated with a 17% reduction in rates of pap smear (incidence rate ratio = 0.83, 95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.84) and prostate-specific antigen testing (incidence rate ratio = 0.83, 95% confidence interval: 0.81-0.85), compared to the general population. By contrast, incidence rates of faecal occult blood testing were only lower in people with severe mental illness among the participants who visited their general practitioner less than an average of five times per year (incidence rate ratio = 0.83, 95% confidence interval = [0.73, 0.94]).  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that differences in screening frequency may explain some of the mismatch between cancer incidence and mortality in people with severe mental illness and indicate that action is required to improve preventive screening in this very disadvantaged group.""","""['Karen M Tuesley', 'Susan J Jordan', 'Dan J Siskind', 'Bradley J Kendall', 'Steve Kisely']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Aust N Z J Psychiatry""","""['Use of cancer screening services in Greece and associated social factors: results from the nation-wide Hellas Health I survey.', 'Awareness and uptake of colorectal, breast, cervical and prostate cancer screening tests in Spain.', 'Benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness of cancer screening in Australia: an overview of modelling estimates.', 'Predictors of screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostatic cancer among community-based primary care practices.', 'Screening for colorectal cancer and prostate cancer: challenges for New Zealand.', 'Colorectal cancer treatment in people with severe mental illness: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Potential Impact of a Public Health Approach to Improving the Physical Health of People Living with Mental Illness.', 'Disability and Participation in Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Hospital healthcare utilizers with medical and psychiatric claims in the Netherlands: a nationwide study.', 'Drug use disorder and risk of incident and fatal prostate cancer among Swedish men: a nationwide epidemiological study.']"""

Methods and results:   Individuals undergoing PCI between 2004 and 2014 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample were included in the study. Multivariable analyses were used to determine the association between cancer diagnosis and in-hospital mortality and complications. 6 571 034 PCI procedures were included and current and previous cancer rates were 1.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Both rates increased over time and the four most common cancers were prostate, breast, colon, and lung cancer. Patients with a current lung cancer had greater in-hospital mortality (odds ratio (OR) 2.81, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.37-3.34) and any in-hospital complication (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.36), while current colon cancer was associated with any complication (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.90-2.48) and bleeding (OR 3.65, 95% CI 3.07-4.35) but not mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.99-1.95).

Emerging evidence suggests that inflammatory cells such as M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells (Tregs ) can contribute to cancer progression by suppressing the anti-tumor immune response. This study investigated the number of CD163-positive M2 macrophages in PCa tissue. It also investigated the correlation and interaction of M2 macrophages and Tregs .  Methods:   This nested case-control study included subjects from a cohort of men diagnosed with PCa as an incidental finding during transurethral resection of the prostate. The cases were 225 men who died from PCa, and the controls were 367 men who survived more than 10 years after PCa diagnosis without disease progression. Infiltrating CD163-positive M2 macrophages and FOXP3/CD4-positive Tregs in PCa tissue were identified using immunohistochemistry. The correlation and interaction of M2 macrophages and Tregs were assessed using Spearman's rank-order correlation and a likelihood test, respectively. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for lethal PCa and macrophage counts.  Results:   The number of M2 macrophages and Tregs showed a significant correlation (P < 0.001) but no interactions. The OR for lethal PCa was 1.93 (95%CI: 1.23-3.03) for men with high numbers of M2 macrophages. Also for cases with uncertain outcome (GS categories 3 + 4 and 4 + 3) high numbers of M2 macrophages does predict a poorer prognosis.  Conclusions:   Our data showed that men with high numbers of M2 macrophages in the prostate tumor environment had increased odds of dying of PCa. It is possible that M2 macrophages, together with other suppressor cells such as Tregs , promote an immunosuppressive environment.""","""['Ann Erlandsson', 'Jessica Carlsson', 'Marie Lundholm', 'Anna Fält', 'Sven-Olof Andersson', 'Ove Andrén', 'Sabina Davidsson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""[""Comparison of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and CD163+ macrophages in invasive and non-invasive extramammary Paget's disease."", 'Immune cell analyses of the tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer highlight infiltrating regulatory T cells and macrophages as adverse prognostic factors.', 'CD4 helper T cells, CD8 cytotoxic T cells, and FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells with respect to lethal prostate cancer.', 'The role of regulatory T cells in the pathogenesis and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Novel Combinatorial Approaches to Tackle the Immunosuppressive Microenvironment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Polyploid Giant Cancer Cells Are Frequently Found in the Urine of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'High infiltration of CD209+ dendritic cells and CD163+ macrophages in the peritumor area of prostate cancer is predictive of late adverse outcomes.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Identification of TREM2-positive tumor-associated macrophages in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: implication for poor prognosis and immunotherapy modulation.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.']"""

Results:   On histochemistry evaluation, the T-cell population in BM appeared to be preserved in patients who had AML compared with healthy donors. The proportion of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in BMAs was higher in patients with AML than in healthy donors. PD1-positive/OX40-positive T cells were more frequent in AML BMAs, and a higher frequency of PD1-positive/cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)-positive T cells coexpressed TIM3 or LAG3. PD1-positive/CD8-positive T cells were more frequent in BMAs from patients who had multiply relapsed AML than in BMAs from those who had first relapsed or newly diagnosed AML. Blasts in BMAs from patients who had TP53-mutated AML were more frequently positive for PD-L1.

Despite its clinical importance, the lack of efficient methods for AR-V7 analysis remains a challenge for broader use of this biomarker in routine clinical practice. Herein, we suggest a practical and non-invasive liquid biopsy method for analysis of AR-V7 in the RNA of urine-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) without the need for blood withdrawal. Urine-derived EVs were isolated by a lab-on-a-disc integrated with six independent nanofiltration units (Exo-Hexa) allowing simultaneous processing of six individual samples. Rapid enrichment of EVs (<30 min) from each 4 mL urine sample was followed by mRNA extraction, and AR-V7 and androgen receptor full-length (AR-FL) mRNA levels in the urinary EVs were quantified by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) as absolute concentrations (copies per mL). Higher AR-V7 and lower AR-FL expressions were detected in urine-derived EVs from 14 patients with CRPC than in those from 22 patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Additionally, we found that AR-V7 transcript levels and the AR-V7/AR-FL ratio in urinary EVs were higher in patients with advanced prostate cancer. This study is the first to report that RNA of urine-derived EVs is a reliable source for AR-V7 expression analysis. The proposed method for quantifying AR-V7 in urinary EVs prepared by a lab-on-a-disc is therefore a simple and promising approach to liquid biopsy with great potential for therapeutic impact on prostate cancer.""","""['Hyun-Kyung Woo', 'Juhee Park', 'Ja Yoon Ku', 'Chan Ho Lee', 'Vijaya Sunkara', 'Hong Koo Ha', 'Yoon-Kyoung Cho']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Lab Chip""","""['The Detection of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Plasma-derived Exosomal RNA Strongly Predicts Resistance to Hormonal Therapy in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Expression pattern of androgen receptors, AR-V7 and AR-567es, in circulating tumor cells and paired plasma-derived extracellular vesicles in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Transcript Levels of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 and Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 2C in Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Methods for androgen receptor splice variant-7 detection: Advances in studies.', 'AR-v7 liquid biopsy for treatment stratification in prostate cancer: how close are we?', 'Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) in Tumor Diagnosis and Therapy.', ""Extracellular Vesicles' Genetic Cargo as Noninvasive Biomarkers in Cancer: A Pilot Study Using ExoGAG Technology."", 'Urine- and Blood-Based Molecular Profiling of Human Prostate Cancer.', 'Urinary exosome-based androgen receptor-variant 7 detection in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Anti-Cancer Role and Therapeutic Potential of Extracellular Vesicles.']"""

Our aim was to use this information in a pragmatic, clinic-based approach so that surgical decision making could be optimized to benefit the patient in their remaining lifetime.  Patients and methods:   A cohort analysis was undertaken of all patients with metastatic disease of the prostate who presented to a regional orthopaedic centre in the United Kingdom between 2003 and 2016. Biochemical data were collected in addition to disease and demographic data. These included: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at orthopaedic presentation; haemoglobin (Hb); platelets (plt); alkaline phosphatase (ALP); albumin (Alb); and corrected calcium (CaC). Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and a Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to the data.  Results:   From the departmental database, 137 episodes were identified in 136 patients with a median age at presentation of 72 years (interquartile range (IQR) 66 to 78). Most patients had stage IV disease (n = 98, 72%), and most did not undergo surgical intervention. At one-year follow-up, 50% of patients had died. Biomarkers found to be independently associated with poor survival were: low Hb, low Alb, relatively low PSA (< 30 mmol/l), and a raised ALP. Patients who needed surgical intervention had a poorer survival rate than patients who were managed nonoperatively.  Conclusion:   The study findings are important for orthopaedic clinical practice in the management of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. The interpretation of routine blood tests can help to predict survival in patients who present with orthopaedic manifestations of prostate cancer. A lower PSA is not necessarily a good prognostic sign. We believe that simple blood testing should be carried out routinely when assessing a patient, guiding potential surgical management and palliative care in the future.""","""['K L Shepherd', 'P Cool', 'G Cribb']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Bone Joint J""","""['Prognostic Factors for Survival in Noncastrate Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Validation of the Glass Model and Development of a Novel Simplified Prognostic Model.', 'Prostate-specific antigen/prostatic acid phosphatase ratio is significant prognostic factor in patients with stage IV prostate cancer.', 'Clinico-pathologic characterisation of metastatic prostate cancer in the Radiotherapy and Oncology Department, Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria-Nigeria: 2006-2009.', 'Radiotherapy and bisphosphonate therapy in bone metastases of prostate carcinoma.', 'Prognostic value of serum markers for prostate cancer.', 'Combined Longitudinal Clinical and Autopsy Phenomic Assessment in Lethal Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Recommendations for Advancing Precision Medicine.']"""

In the present study, four cyclohexanone curcumin analogs were synthesized. Additionally, their anticancer progression activity on CRPC cell lines, PC3 and PLS10 cells, was examined. We first determined their anti-metastasis properties and found that 2,6-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzylidene)-cyclohexanone (2A) and 2,6-bis-(3,4-dihydroxy-benzylidene)-cyclohexanone (2F) showed higher anti-invasion properties against CRPC cells than curcumin. Analog 2A inhibited both MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretions and activities, whereas analog 2F reduced only MMP activities. These findings suggest that the compounds may inhibit CRPC cell metastasis by decreased extracellular matrix degradation. Analog 2A, the most potent analog, was then subjected to an in vivo study. Similar to curcumin, analog 2A was detectable in the serum of mice at 30 and 60 minutes after i.p. injections. Analog 2A and curcumin (30 mg/kg bodyweight) showed a similar ability to reduce tumor area in lungs of mice that were i.v. injected with PLS10 cells. Additionally, analog 2A showed superior growth inhibitory effect on PLS10 cells than that of curcumin both in vitro and in vivo. The compound inhibited PLS10 cells growth by induction of G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in vitro.

Based on mechanistically-supported rationale we explored new therapeutic options based on clinically available drugs with anticancer effects, including inhibitors of PARP1 enzyme (PARPi), and histone deacetylases (vorinostat), respectively, and disulfiram (DSF, known as alcohol-abuse drug Antabuse) and its copper-chelating metabolite CuET that inhibit protein turnover.  Methods:   Drugs and their combination with ionizing radiation (IR) were tested in various cytotoxicity assays in three human PCa cell lines including radio-resistant stem-cell like derived cells. Mechanistically, DNA damage repair, heat shock and unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways were assessed by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting.  Results:   We observed enhanced sensitivity to PARPi/IR in PC3 cells consistent with lower homologous recombination (HR) repair. Vorinostat sensitized DU145 cells to PARPi/IR and decreased mutant p53. Vorinostat also impaired HR-mediated DNA repair, as determined by Rad51 foci formation and downregulation of TOPBP1 protein, and overcame radio-resistance of stem-cell like DU145-derived cells. All PCa models responded well to CuET or DSF combined with copper. We demonstrated that DSF interacts with copper in the culture media and forms adequate levels of CuET indicating that DSF/copper and CuET may be considered as comparable treatments.

Most research has focused on changes during or after treatment, so clinical significance of change at diagnosis remains unclear. This study aimed to determine prevalence, predictors and prognostic significance of weight changes at diagnosis in outpatients with solid tumours presenting to a tertiary academic medical centre.  Methods:   A retrospective study of the electronic medical record was conducted (n = 6477). Those with weight recorded within 6 months of cancer diagnosis (pre-diagnosis, T0) and 2 subsequent weights (diagnosis, T1; final visit, T2) were identified (n = 4258). Percentage weight change was categorised into four bands (0.1-2.4%; 2.5-5%; 5.01-9.9%; ≥ 10%) for gain and loss. A stable category was also included.  Results:   Mean age is 61 ± 12.5 years. Common tumour sites: breast (17%; n = 725), prostate (16%; n = 664), lung (14%; n = 599). 15% (n = 652) had metastatic disease at T1. 98% (n = 4159) had weight change at T1. Head & neck and upper gastrointestinal cancers were significantly associated with weight loss (p < 0.001). Worst survival occurred with ≥ 10% weight gain or ≥ 10% weight loss. Overweight or obese body mass index with any percentage weight change band was associated with better overall survival.  Conclusions:   Most had evidence of clinically significant weight changes at diagnosis. Weight loss at diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of further weight loss. A detailed weight history at cancer diagnosis is essential to identify and intervene for those most at risk of weight change-related early mortality.""","""[""Niamh O'Donoghue"", 'Shiva Shrotriya', 'Aynur Aktas', 'Barbara Hullihen', 'Serkan Ayvaz', 'Bassam Estfan', 'Declan Walsh']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Body mass index and weight change in relation to triple-negative breast cancer survival.', 'Postdiagnosis Weight Change and Survival Following a Diagnosis of Early-Stage Breast Cancer.', 'Weight Gain After Breast Cancer Diagnosis and All-Cause Mortality: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Weight Loss Interventions to Prevent Obesity-Related Morbidity and Mortality in Adults: An Updated Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Prospective Cohort Study of Pre- and Postdiagnosis Obesity and Endometrial Cancer Survival.', 'Association of body mass index with toxicity and survival in pediatric patients treated with cisplatin-containing regimens.', 'Role that anorexia and weight loss play in patients with stage IV lung cancer.']"""

We examined the affinity of 99mTc-labeled compounds for these transporters and their stability.  Methods: 99mTc-MIBI and 99mTc-TF were incubated in vesicles expressing P-glycoprotein (MDR1), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1-4, or breast cancer resistance protein with and without verapamil (MDR1 inhibitor) or MK-571 (MRP inhibitor). Time activity curves of 99mTc-labeled compounds were established using SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, SK-MEL-28 melanoma, and PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines, and transporter expression of multiple drug resistance was measured in these cells. The stability was evaluated.  Results:   In vesicles, 99mTc-labeled compounds had affinity for MDR1 and MRP1. 99mTc-TF had additional affinity for MRP2 and MRP3. In SK-N-SH cells expressing MDR1 and MRP1, MK-571 produced the highest uptake of both 99mTc-labeled compounds. 99mTc-MIBI uptake with inhibitors was higher than 99mTc-TF uptake with inhibitors. 99mTc-TF was taken up more in SK-MEL-28 cells expressing MRP1 and MRP2 than PC-3 cells expressing MRP1 and MRP3. 99mTc-MIBI was metabolized, whereas 99mTc-TF had high stability.  Conclusion: 99mTc-MIBI is exported via MDR1 and MRP1 (MRP1 > MDR1) at greater levels and more quickly compared to 99mTc-TF, which is exported via MDR1 and MRP1-3 (MRP1 > MDR1; MRP1, 2 > MRP3).

However, it has been unclear whether this is due to indication bias.  Objective:   To investigate rates of change in comorbidity for men on GnRH agonists versus AA monotherapy in a population-based register study.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men with advanced nonmetastatic prostate cancer (PCa) who received primary AA (n=2078) or GnRH agonists (n=4878) and age- and area-matched PCa-free men were selected from Prostate Cancer Database Sweden 3.0. Increases in comorbidity were measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), from 5yr before through to 5yr after starting androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Outcome measures and statistical methods:   Multivariable linear regression was used to determine differences in excess rate of CCI change before and after ADT initiation. Risk of any incremental change in CCI following ADT was assessed using multivariable Cox regression analyses.  Results and limitations:   Men on GnRH agonists experienced a greater difference in excess rate of CCI change after starting ADT than men on AA monotherapy (5.6% per yr, p<0.001). Risk of any new CCI change after ADT was greater for GnRH agonists than for AA (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.44).  Conclusions:   Impact on comorbidity was lower for men on AA monotherapy than for men on GnRH agonists. Our results should be confirmed through randomised trials of effectiveness and adverse effects, comparing AA monotherapy and GnRH agonists in men with advanced nonmetastatic PCa who are unsuitable for curative treatment.  Patient summary:   Hormone therapies for advanced prostate cancer can increase the risk of other diseases (eg, heart disease, diabetes).

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a phenomenon required for morphological conversion of non-motile discoid shaped epithelial cells to highly motile spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells, is thought to be a pre-requisite for metastatic progression. Metastasis-associated 1 (MTA1) protein is a prime inducer of EMT and metastatic progression in all solid tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression and function of MTA1 in HCC have not been elucidated.  Methods:   In silico prediction algorithms were used to find microRNAs (miRNAs) that may target MTA1. We examined the relationship between the expression of MTA1 and miR-183 using quantitative real time PCR. We also determined the levels of the MTA1 protein using immunohistochemistry. Reporter assays, in the presence and absence of the miR-183 mimic, were used to confirm MTA1 as a bona fide target of miR183. The effect of miR-183 on HCC pathogenesis was determined using a combination of in vitro migration and invasion assay, together with in vivo xenograft experiments. The correlation between miR-183 and MTA1 expression was also studied in samples from HCC patients, and in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset.  Results:   Analysis of the sequence database revealed that MTA1 is a putative target of miR-183. MTA1 protein and RNA expression showed opposite trends to miR-183 expression in breast, renal, prostate, and testicular tissue samples from cancer patients, and in the metastatic HCC cell line HepG2. An inverse correlation was also observed between MTA1 (high) and miR-183 (low) expression within samples from HHC patients and in the TCGA dataset. Reporter assays in HepG2 cells showed that miR-183 could inhibit translation of a reporter harboring the wild-type, but not the mutant miR-183 3'-untranslated region (UTR). In addition, miR-183 significantly inhibited in vitro migration and invasion in HepG2 cells, and in vivo hepatic metastasis.  Conclusion:   Our results reveal a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism for MTA1 expression via miR-183, which is suppressed during HCC pathogenesis.""","""['Wei Bian', 'Hongfei Zhang', 'Miao Tang', 'Shaojun Zhang', 'Lichao Wang', 'Longlong Liu', 'Wenyao Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['MTA1 modulated by miR-30e contributes to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma through an ErbB2-dependent pathway.', 'miR-139-5p inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2.', 'The E3 ligase for metastasis associated 1 protein, TRIM25, is targeted by microRNA-873 in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Tumor metastasis-associated human MTA1 gene and its MTA1 protein product: role in epithelial cancer cell invasion, proliferation and nuclear regulation.', 'Antitumor function of microRNA-122 against hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The miR-183 Cluster: Biogenesis, Functions, and Cell Communication via Exosomes in Cancer.', 'Gliomas display distinct sex-based differential methylation patterns based on molecular subtype.', 'MicroRNA-183 in Cancer Progression.']"""

Supporters were more likely to treat pelvic nodes (88% vs. 56%, p < 01) and trended to be more likely to treat patients with moderate or extreme hypofractionation (58% vs. 28%, p = 065). Supporters trended to be more likely to offer brachytherapy boost (55% vs. 23%, p = 09), favor initial observation and early salvage over adjuvant radiation (77% vs. 55%, p = 09), and to consider themselves expert brachytherapists (69% vs. 39%, p = 09).  Conclusions:   There is a polarization among GU radiation oncology experts regarding novel imaging techniques. A correlation emerged between support of novel imaging and adoption of treatment approaches that are clinically superior or less expensive. Pre - existing biases among GU experts on national treatment - decision panels and leaders of cooperative group studies may affect the design of future studies and influence the adoption of these technologies in clinical practice.""","""['Kiri A Sandler', 'Shearwood McClelland rd', 'Catherine Degnin', 'Yiyi Chen', 'Timur Mitin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Dramatically Polarized Opinion on the Role of Brachytherapy Boost in Management of High-risk Prostate Cancer: A Survey of North American Genitourinary Expert Radiation Oncologists.', 'Active Surveillance for Low and Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer: Opinions of North American Genitourinary Oncology Expert Radiation Oncologists.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Is moderate hypofractionation accepted as a new standard of care in north america for prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy?

The aim of this study was to evaluate surgical outcomes of the surgeons during the learning curve in relation to the bedside assistant's experience level during RARP.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed two non - laparoscopic, beginner robotic surgeon's cases, and we divided the patients into two groups. The first surgeon completed the operations on 20 patients with a beginner bedside assistant in February - May 2009 (Group-1). The second surgeon completed operations on 16 patients with an experienced (at least 150 cases) bedside assistant in February 2015 - December 2015 (Group-2). The collected data included age, prostate volume, prostate specific antigen (PSA), estimated blood loss, complications and percent of positive surgical margins. In addition, the elapsed time for trocar insertion, robot docking, console surgery, specimen extraction and total anesthesia time were measured separately.  Results:   There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, co-morbidity, prostate volume, PSA value, preoperative Gleason score, number of positive cores, postoperative Gleason score, pathological grade, protection rate of neurovascular bundles, surgical margin positivity, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, or estimated blood loss. The robot docking, trocar placement, console surgery, anesthesia and specimen extraction times were significantly shorter in group 2 than they were in group 1 (17.75 ± 3.53 min vs. 30.20 ± 7.54 min, p ≤ 0.001; 9.63 ± 2.71 min vs. 14.40 ± 4.52 min , p = 0.001; 189.06 ± 27.70 min vs. 244.95 ± 80.58 min, p = 0.01; 230.94 ± 30.83 min vs. 306.75 ± 87.96 min, p = 0.002; 10.19 ± 2.54 min vs. 17.55 ± 8.79 min, p = 0.002; respectively).  Conclusion:   Although the bedside assistant's experience in RARP does not appear to influence the robotic surgeon's oncological outcomes during the learning curve, it may reduce the potential complications by shortening the total operation time.""","""['Haci Ibrahim Cimen', 'Yavuz Tarik Atik', 'Serkan Altinova', 'Oztug Adsan', 'Mevlana Derya Balbay']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Serving as a bedside surgeon before performing robotic radical prostatectomy improves surgical outcomes.', 'Quantifying the ""Assistant Effect"" in Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP): Measures of Technical Performance.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', 'Methods for training of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Improving ergonomics for the bedside assistant in robotic colorectal surgery.', 'Seniority of the assistant surgeon and perioperative outcomes in robotic-assisted proctectomy for rectal cancer.', 'The effect of bedside assistant technical performance on outcomes in robotic surgery.', 'Can remote assistance for robotic surgery improve surgical performance in simulation training?

The objective of this study was to assess event-driven medical resource utilization (MRU) of ADT plus AA+P (ADT+AA+P) versus ADT plus dual placebos (ADT+placebos) in LATITUDE.  Methods:   Event-driven MRU data from LATITUDE while patients were on treatment were used for analyses. Types of MRU included overnight hospitalizations and length of stay (LOS), emergency room (ER) visits, radiotherapy, surgery, imaging, and specialist and general practitioner (GP) visits. Rates by treatment (per 100 person-years) and rate ratios comparing ADT+AA+P with ADT+placebos were estimated with zero-inflated Poisson regression. The difference in the average hospital LOS between arms was assessed with repeated measures regression analyses. Reasons for hospitalization were explored. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results.  Results:   A total of 1199 patients were enrolled in LATITUDE. Significantly lower rates of hospitalization (a 24% reduction), imaging (a 36% reduction), and radiotherapy (a 50% reduction) were observed with ADT+AA+P versus ADT+placebos. There was a nonsignificant trend of lower rates of specialist visits and surgery. The rates of ER and GP visits and the average LOS per hospitalization episode were similar across arms. The most common hospitalization reasons were genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and respiratory tract symptoms/disorders. The results remained consistent in a sensitivity analysis.  Conclusions:   Adding AA+P to ADT does not increase MRU and leads to lower rates of hospitalization, imaging, and radiotherapy. This likely reflects the more favorable clinical outcomes with ADT+AA+P therapy.""","""['Tracy Li', 'Conrado Franco-Villalobos', 'Irina Proskorovsky', 'Sonja V Sorensen', 'NamPhuong Tran', 'Giri Sulur', 'Kim N Chi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Patient-reported outcomes following abiraterone acetate plus prednisone added to androgen deprivation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic castration-naive prostate cancer (LATITUDE): an international, randomised phase 3 trial.', 'Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (LATITUDE): final overall survival analysis of a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.', 'Correlation of Prostate-specific Antigen Kinetics with Overall Survival and Radiological Progression-free Survival in Metastatic Castration-sensitive Prostate Cancer Treated with Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone or Placebos Added to Androgen Deprivation Therapy: Post Hoc Analysis of Phase 3 LATITUDE Study.', 'Treatment of Castration-naive Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate/androgen deprivation therapy combination versus docetaxel/androgen deprivation therapy combination in advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: a network meta-analysis on safety and efficacy.', 'Abiraterone acetate in combination with androgen deprivation therapy compared to androgen deprivation therapy only for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.']"""

We conducted four nested case-control studies using a large UK population-based database. Cases were defined as individuals with any medical code for the specific malignancy. For every case, we used incidence-density sampling to match four controls by age, sex, practice site, and both duration and calendar time of follow-up. Exposure of interest was any diagnosis of PTSD prior to cancer diagnosis. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer risk associated with PTSD were estimated using multivariable conditional logistic regression and were adjusted for smoking status, obesity, and antidepressant use. The study population included four case groups according to cancer type. There were 19,143 cases with lung cancer (74,473 matched controls), 22,163 cases with colorectal cancer (86,538 matched controls), 31,352 cases with breast cancer (123,285 matched controls), and 27,212 cases with prostate cancer (105,940 matched controls).

This limitation may be overcome by using viable tumor slice material. Here we report on the establishment of an optimized ex vivo method to culture tissue slices from patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of prostate cancer (PCa), to assess responses to PCa treatments.  Methods:   Three PDX models were used that are characterized by different androgen receptor (AR) expression and different homology directed DNA repair capacities, due to a breast cancer associated two (BRCA2) wild-type or mutated status. Tumors were removed from mice, sliced using a vibratome and cultured for a maximum of 6 days. To test the sensitivity to androgen antagonist, tumor slices from the AR-expressing and AR-negative PDX tumors were treated with the anti-androgen enzalutamide. For sensitivity to DNA repair intervention, tumors slices from BRCA2 wild-type and mutated PDXs were treated with the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 inhibitor olaparib. Treatment response in these tumor slices was determined by measuring slice morphology, cell proliferation, apoptosis, AR expression level, and secretion of prostate specific antigen (PSA).  Results:   We compared various culture conditions (support materials, growth media, and use of a 3D smooth rocking platform) to define the optimal condition to maintain tissue viability and proliferative capacity up to least 6 days. Under optimized conditions, enzalutamide treatment significantly decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and reduced AR-expression and PSA secretion of AR-expressing tumor slices compared to AR-negative slices, that did not respond to the intervention. Olaparib treatment significantly increased cell death in BRCA2 mutated tumors slices as compared to slices from BRCA2 wild type tumors.  Conclusions:   Ex vivo treatment of PCa PDX tumor slices with enzalutamide and olaparib recapitulates responses previously observed in vivo. The faithful retention of tissue structure and function in this ex vivo model offers an ideal opportunity for treatment efficacy screening, thereby reducing costs and numbers of experimental animals.""","""['Wenhao Zhang', 'Wytske M van Weerden', 'Corrina M A de Ridder', 'Sigrun Erkens-Schulze', 'Edgar Schönfeld', 'Titia G Meijer', 'Roland Kanaar', 'Dik C van Gent', 'Julie Nonnekens']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'Androgen receptor inhibitor-induced ""BRCAness"" and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide, an androgen receptor signaling inhibitor, induces tumor regression in a mouse model of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Defective DNA repair mechanisms in prostate cancer: impact of olaparib.', 'PARP Inhibitors in Prostate Cancer.', 'Culture of vibrating microtome tissue slices as a 3D model in biomedical research.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'Ex Vivo Functional Assay for Evaluating Treatment Response in Tumor Tissue of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.', 'Experimental in vitro, ex\xa0vivo and in vivo models in prostate cancer research.']"""

This study aimed to develop a conceptual model that describes patients' experiences of living with this condition.  Methods:   This was a cross-sectional, non-interventional qualitative research study. Sixty-minute semi-structured interviews were conducted with physicians experienced in treating metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and with chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcripts were analysed to identify the key symptoms and impacts on quality of life. Results were used to expand a previously published conceptual model for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Results:   Three physicians and 19 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were interviewed. Physicians identified several symptoms frequently mentioned by their patients: fatigue, bone pain, anxiety, stress, depression and interference with daily activities. The most salient symptoms emerging from the patient interviews were urinary frequency and urgency, fatigue, pain/stiffness and sexual dysfunction. The most salient impacts were interference with daily activities, frustration, anxiety and sleep problems. Compared with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, some symptoms and impacts in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were more common and rated as more disturbing (e.g. fatigue, pain, urinary frequency, interference with daily activities and frustration). New concepts that were added to the non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer model, to more accurately reflect the experiences of patients with metastatic disease, were enlarged breasts, muscle loss/deconditioning, inability to focus/mental slowing, body image perception, interference with work and lack of ambition/motivation.  Conclusions:   Chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer experience a substantial burden from their condition. Furthermore, as castration-resistant prostate cancer progresses from the non-metastatic stage to the early metastatic (pre-chemotherapy) stage, certain symptoms become more common and disturb patients' lives to a greater extent.

Methods:   All men with clinically localized prostate cancer undergoing RARP in our tertiary referral centre between May 2005 and August 2016 were retrospectively identified. Patients with neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. Comparisons were made between cases with negative surgical margins (NSM), unifocal PSM (uPSM), and multifocal PSM (mPSM).  Results:   From a total of 973 patients available for analysis, 315 (32%) had a PSM. In these patients, 190 had uPSM and 125 had mPSM. Focality of PSM was significantly associated with tumour stage and grade, preoperative PSA, and postoperative PSA persistence (all p < 0.001), but not with nerve sparing (NS) (p = 0.15). PSA persistence was found in 120 (12%) patients, resulting in 853 patients available for survival analyses with a median follow-up of 52 months. Both uPSM and mPSM were found to be independent predictors of BCR, conferring a hazard ratio of 1.9 (95% CI 1.3-3.0; p = 0.002) and 3.4 (95% CI 2.1-5.6; p < 0.001), respectively, when compared to NSM.

Conclusions:   Based on a large case series of RARP, we found PSM focality to be an independent predictor of BCR, with a 1.9- and 3.4-fold risk increase for BCR in case of uPSM and mPSM, respectively.

In men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), CRF was reported in 12-21% of patients. Approved systemic therapy against CRPC is commonly administered in combination with androgen-deprivation treatment (ADT) and, in some cases, with daily, low-dose corticosteroids. Importantly, the use of low-dose corticosteroids is associated with multiple negative effects, including reduced muscle mass. On these grounds, we hypothesized that the chronic use of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of fatigue in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We reviewed all randomized trials published during the last 15 years conducted in patients with prostate cancer receiving systemic treatment and we performed a sub-group analysis to gather insights regarding the potential differences in the incidence of fatigue in patients receiving vs. not receiving daily corticosteroids as part of their systemic anti-neoplastic regimen.  Results:   Overall, 22,734 men enrolled in prospective randomized phase II and III trials were evaluable for fatigue. Estimated pooled incidence of grade 1-2 fatigue was 30.89% (95% CI = 25.34-36.74), while estimated pooled incidence of grade 3-4 fatigue was reported in 3.90% (95% CI = 2.91-5.02). Sub-group analysis showed that grade 3-4 fatigue was approximately double in patients who received daily corticosteroids as part of their anti-neoplastic treatment (5.58; 95% CI = 4.33-6.98) vs. those who did not (2.67%; 95% CI = 1.53-4.11).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of institutional experience on postimplant dosimetric parameters in a nationwide prospective cohort study.  Methods:   From July 2005 to June 2007, 2354 patients were registered in the Japanese Prostate Cancer Outcome Study of Permanent I‑125 Seed Implantation (J-POPS), and 1126 patients treated with seed implantation alone were evaluated. As a surrogate for institutional experience, we classified the J‑POPS institutions as high-volume (patient accrual volume was ≥120 patients per institution) or low-volume institutions (patient accrual volume was <120 patients per institution). To compare treatment quality between institutions, we evaluated the postimplant dosimetric parameters including D90, V100/150 (prostatic dose parameters), UD5/90, U200 (urethral dose parameters), and rectum R100/150 (rectal dose parameters).  Results:   In the 5 high-volume institutions (n = 601 patients), most of the patients were treated with >144 Gy of D90, whereas in the 20 low-volume institutions (n = 525) some of the patients were treated with <144 Gy. The V100 of most of the high-volume institution patients were >90%, whereas in the low-volume institutions a considerable percentage of patients showed lower V100. Although there was no correlation between D90 and rectal dose parameters, UD90 had a moderate positive correlation with D90 in both the high- and low-volume institutions. U200 varied more widely in the low-volume institutions.

It is a first-line chemotherapy treatment for patients with metastasized, hormone-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) or for patients with high-risk, localized PCa that could benefit from early chemotherapy treatment. Previously, we showed that stearidonic acid (SDA), an omega-3 fatty acid, enhances the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX) in human PCa cells. This observation suggests that PCa therapies using SDA and chemotherapeutic drugs in combination offer attractive possibilities for developing treatments that ameliorate toxic side effects of some commonly used chemotherapy drugs. Objectives: We used androgen-resistant PC3 and DU 145 cells derived from human prostate cancer to quantify the effects of combined SDA and DOC on proliferation/viability and on the production of pro-apoptotic caspases 9 and 3. We also compared the effects of SDA with those of BAY, a pharmacological inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ĸB), in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. Finally, we qualitatively and quantitatively assessed the drug combination on androgen receptor (AR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) expression in LNCaP and PC3 cells, respectively. Methods: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and combination indices of SDA and DOC in PC3 and DU 145 cells were determined using the MTT cell viability assay. To quantify the effects of SDA and BAY on NF-ĸB activity, we used luciferase reporter assays in LNCaP cells that were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying NF-ĸB response element sequence upstream of the luciferase gene sequence. AR and PPARγ expression were assessed by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. We considered caspase 9 and 3 cleavage to be apoptosis markers and determined the drug combination effect on the extent of that cleavage by western blot analysis. Results: The cytotoxic effects of DOC were synergistically enhanced by SDA when the two were added to DU145 and PC3 cell cultures. Combination index (CI) analyses based on the Chou-Talalay method and mass action law showed synergistic interaction with CI <1. SDA suppressed TNFα-induced NF-κB activity similarly to BAY. The SDA/DOC combination down regulated testosterone (T)-induced AR and troglitazone-induced PPARγ protein expression when compared to using the drugs singly. Similarly, the SDA/DOC combination induced caspase 9 and 3 production and cleavage suggesting apoptosis induction. Like our DOX studies, this work provides proof-of-concept for using SDA and DOC in combination to reduce the dose, and therefore the toxicity, of DOC and possibly increasing the survival benefit in DOC clinical translation studies.""","""['Mahmoud Mansour', 'Sabrina van Ginkel', 'John C Dennis', 'Brandon Mason', 'Isra Elhussin', 'Kodye Abbott', 'Satyanarayana R Pondugula', 'Temesgen Samuel', 'Edward Morrison']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cancer""","""['NF-kappaB activation enhances cell death by antimitotic drugs in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Docosahexaenoic acid enhances the efficacy of docetaxel in prostate cancer cells by modulation of apoptosis: the role of genes associated with the NF-kappaB pathway.', 'Interleukin 6, a nuclear factor-kappaB target, predicts resistance to docetaxel in hormone-independent prostate cancer and nuclear factor-kappaB inhibition by PS-1145 enhances docetaxel antitumor activity.', 'Combination effects of docetaxel and Doxorubicin in hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells.', ""22.

Methods:   We used primary data generated by a team consisting of a pathologist, cancer biologists, a biostatistician, and epidemiologists. We examined their contributions by phase of biomarker evaluation to identify when, through the practice of team science, threats to internal validity were recognized and solved. Next, we quantified the extent of bias avoided in evaluating the association of Ki67 (immunohistochemistry), stromal cell telomere length (fluorescence in situ hybridization), and microRNA (miRNA) (miR-21, miR-141, miR-221; quantitative RT-PCR) with prostate cancer risk or recurrence in nested case-control studies.  Results:   Threats to validity were tissue storage time (Ki67, miRNA) and laboratory equipment maintenance (telomeres). Solutions were all in the data analysis phase and involved using tissue storage-time specific cutpoints and/or batch-specific cutpoints. Bias in the regression coefficient for quantiles of each biomarker ranged from 24% to 423%, and the coefficient for the test for trend ranged from 15% to 910%. The interpretation of the associations changed as follows: Ki67, null to positive; stromal cell telomere length, null to positive; miR-21 and miR-141 remained null; miR-221, weak to moderate inverse.

The growth and survival pathways driven by AR remain incompletely defined. Here, we found PDCD4 to be a new target of AR signaling and a potent regulator of prostate cancer cell growth, survival, and castration resistance. The 3' untranslated region of PDCD4 is directly targeted by the androgen-induced miRNA, miR-21. Androgen treatment suppressed PDCD4 expression in a dose responsive and miR-21-dependent manner. Correspondingly, AR inhibition dose-responsively induced PDCD4 expression. Using data from prostate cancer tissue samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found a significant and inverse correlation between miR-21 and PDCD4 mRNA and protein levels. Higher Gleason grade tumors exhibited significantly higher levels of miR-21 and significantly lower levels of PDCD4 mRNA and protein. PDCD4 knockdown enhanced androgen-dependent cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression, inhibited apoptosis, and was sufficient to drive androgen-independent growth. On the other hand, PDCD4 overexpression inhibited miR-21-mediated growth and androgen independence. The stable knockdown of PDCD4 in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells enhanced subcutaneous tumor take rate in vivo, accelerated tumor growth, and was sufficient for castration-resistant tumor growth. IMPLICATIONS: This study provides the first evidence that PDCD4 is an androgen-suppressed protein capable of regulating prostate cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, and castration resistance.

Methods for quantifying the conformational effects of inhibitors and linking them to an understanding of selectivity patterns have long been elusive. We have developed an ultrafast time-resolved fluorescence methodology that tracks structural movements of the kinase activation loop in solution with angstrom-level precision, and can resolve multiple structural states and quantify conformational shifts between states. Profiling a panel of clinically relevant Aurora kinase inhibitors against the mitotic kinase Aurora A revealed a wide range of conformational preferences, with all inhibitors promoting either the active DFG-in state or the inactive DFG-out state, but to widely differing extents. Remarkably, these conformational preferences explain broad patterns of inhibitor selectivity across different activation states of Aurora A, with DFG-out inhibitors preferentially binding Aurora A activated by phosphorylation on the activation loop, which dynamically samples the DFG-out state, and DFG-in inhibitors binding preferentially to Aurora A constrained in the DFG-in state by its allosteric activator Tpx2. The results suggest that many inhibitors currently in clinical development may be capable of differentiating between Aurora A signaling pathways implicated in normal mitotic control and in melanoma, neuroblastoma, and prostate cancer. The technology is applicable to a wide range of clinically important kinases and could provide a wealth of valuable structure-activity information for the development of inhibitors that exploit differences in conformational dynamics to achieve enhanced selectivity.""","""['Eric W Lake', 'Joseph M Muretta', 'Andrew R Thompson', 'Damien M Rasmussen', 'Abir Majumdar', 'Erik B Faber', 'Emily F Ruff', 'David D Thomas', 'Nicholas M Levinson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Identification of small molecule inhibitors of the Aurora-A/TPX2 complex.', 'Molecular mechanism of Aurora A kinase autophosphorylation and its allosteric activation by TPX2.', 'A TPX2 Proteomimetic Has Enhanced Affinity for Aurora-A Due to Hydrocarbon Stapling of a Helix.', 'Switching Aurora-A kinase on and off at an allosteric site.', 'Allosteric Targeting of Aurora A Kinase Using Small Molecules: A Step Forward Towards Next Generation Medicines?', 'Structural basis for CEP192-mediated regulation of centrosomal AURKA.', 'A biophysical framework for double-drugging kinases.', 'When Just One Phosphate Is One Too Many: The Multifaceted Interplay between Myc and Kinases.', 'Aurora Kinase A Regulation by Cysteine Oxidative Modification.', 'Combined In Silico and In Vitro Evidence Supporting an Aurora A Kinase Inhibitory Role of the Anti-Viral Drug Rilpivirine and an Anti-Proliferative Influence on Cancer Cells.']"""

However, tissue fixation causes modifications of nucleic acids, making it challenging to extract high-quality nucleic acids from formalin fixated tissues.  Methods:   In this study, the efficiency of five commercial nucleic acid extraction kits was compared on 30 prostate biopsies with normal histology, and the quantity and quality of the products were compared using spectrophotometry and Agilent's BioAnalyzer.

Methods:   The PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase databases were sought to identify eligible studies concerning serum neuroendocrine markers and the prognosis of post-treatment mCRPC from inception to April 2018. The association between serum neuroendocrine markers, that is, chromogranin A (CgA) and neurone-specific enolase (NSE), levels and the prognosis of post-treatment mCRPC were summarized using a random-effects model and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess potential bias.  Results:   A total of 234 participants are included in this meta-analysis (mean age = 71.3 years) from 6 studies. The pooled results show that higher markers' levels at baseline in patients were associated with unfavorable overall survival (OS; univariate analysis: HR 3.775, 95% CI 1.469-9.698, p = 0.006; multivariate analysis: HR 3.838, 95% CI 1.774-8.304, p = 0.001), and a similar situation was observed in progression-free survival (PFS; univariate analysis: HR 2.785, 95% CI 1.315-5.898, p = 0.007; multivariate analysis: HR 1.266, 95% CI 1.017-1.577, p = 0.035). Estimates of the total effects were generally consistent in the sensitivity analysis. Publication bias was observed when performing the univariate analysis of PFS, and we have the explanation accordingly.  Conclusions:   The results of this pooled analysis confirm serum neuroendocrine markers could be the effective predictor of treatment outcome in patients with mCRPC. In addition, a combination of CgA and NSE is more valuable to predict worse OS. Further randomized case-control trials are required to validate this relationship.""","""['Yangzhou Liu', 'Shankun Zhao', 'Jiamin Wang', 'Zhiguo Zhu', 'Lianmin Luo', 'Ermao Li', 'Fucai Tang', 'Zhigang Zhao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Chromogranin A: a useful biomarker in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Chromogranin A and neurone-specific enolase variations during the first 3 months of abiraterone therapy predict outcomes in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Chromogranin A and neurone-specific enolase serum levels as predictors of treatment outcome in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer undergoing abiraterone therapy.', 'Prospective Evaluation of Neuromediator Dynamics in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients During Docetaxel.', 'Effectiveness and tolerability of targeted drugs for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Prognostic Significance of Chromogranin A Expression in the Initial and Second Biopsies in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Chromogranin A: a useful biomarker in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Plasma progastrin-releasing peptide level shows different predictive profiles for treatment response by androgen receptor axis-targeted agents in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination therapy in metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer: A Systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Combined Longitudinal Clinical and Autopsy Phenomic Assessment in Lethal Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Recommendations for Advancing Precision Medicine.']"""

We therefore sought to determine if clinically acceptable outcome estimates could be created using a modified version of the Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF), a formal method for eliciting judgments regarding probability distributions of expected decision outcomes.  Methods:   We asked a panel of 3 urologists, 4 radiation oncologists, and 2 medical oncologists to estimate the probabilities of 11 treatment outcomes based on their clinical experience and an annotated evidence summary. The estimates were elicited using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing a self-guided, adapted version of the SHELF Roulette method distributed via email. We created combined outcome estimates by taking the mean values of the panel members' upper and lower 95% bounds for each outcome. The combined estimates were then distributed via email to the panel for final approval.  Results:   Eight of the 9 responses were judged to be correct applications of the SHELF method and included in the combined outcome estimates. The final set of outcome estimates was unanimously accepted by the clinician panel members and used to create a decision dashboard suitable for clinical use and evaluation.  Conclusions:   Many important health care decisions need to be made in situations where the evidence base is inadequate. Use of a formal protocol for eliciting expert judgments is feasible and can be used to promote evidence-based practice by providing a powerful tool to facilitate the combination of professional judgment with research evidence and patient preferences to guide clinical decisions.""","""['James G Dolan', 'Peter J Veazie']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['A comparison of two methods for expert elicitation in health technology assessments.', 'Understanding Medical Decision-making in Prostate Cancer Care.', 'Perceptions of Urologists About the Conversational Elements Leading to Treatment Decision-Making Among Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Complementarity of Clinician Judgment and Evidence Based Models in Medical Decision Making: Antecedents, Prospects, and Challenges.', 'Models based on value and probability in health improve shared decision making.', 'The Development and Pilot Study of a Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to Compare Patient and Provider Priorities around Amputation-Level Outcomes.', 'Quantitative decision making for investment in global health intervention trials: Case study of the NEWBORN study on emollient therapy in preterm infants in Kenya.']"""

The aim of this study was to examine dyadic linkages between perceived social support (from spouses and friends) and preventive healthcare behaviors among coupled-individuals.  Design and methods:   Prospective data from the Health and Retirement Study (2010, 2012) were used to analyze a sample of coupled-individuals (dyad N = 1,902). A series of multilevel logistic regression (actor-partner interdependence) models were estimated to evaluate whether perceived social support from spouses and friends was associated with the likelihood of using two common forms of preventive healthcare services (i.e., influenza vaccination and cancer screenings).  Results:   Apart from the role of perceived support from spouse on flu vaccinations, wives' preventive healthcare behaviors were unrelated to perceived social support. In contrast, husbands' preventive healthcare behaviors showed consistent associations with perceived social support from friends for the 2-year observation period. Further, husbands' receipt of prostate cancer screening was associated with wives' perceptions of social support from spouse as well as friends.  Discussion and implications:   These findings contributed to our understanding of the health advantages associated with being in a marital relationship for preventive healthcare behaviors, especially for men.

Clinical, laboratory and radiological information were correlated with glycosaminoglycan quantification by statistical analysis.  Results:   Serum HA was significantly increased in cancer patients (39.68 ± 30.00 ng/ mL) compared to control group (15.04 ± 7.11 ng/mL; p=0.004) and was further increased in high-risk prostate cancer patients when compared to lower risk patients (p = 0.0214).

Methods:   Clinically localized prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy were recruited between 2011 and 2014. Of the 350 participants enrolled at the main site, 310 provided self-reported physical activity at baseline before radical prostatectomy, and 5 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after radical prostatectomy. A subset of participants (n = 81) provided objectively measured physical activity at all study time points by wearing an accelerometer for 7 days each. Changes in activity over time were compared using Friedman's test. Agreement between self-reported and objective measures was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.  Results:   Self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was high at baseline (median, 32.1 min/day), followed by a decline at 5 weeks (median, 15.0 min/day) and a recovery at 6 and 12 months (median, 32.1-47.1 min/day).

Various risk factors may lead to carcinogenesis, including infectious agents such as polyomavirus BK (BKPyV), which infects the human renourinary tract, establishes latency, and encodes oncoproteins. Previous studies suggested that BKPyV plays a role in PCa pathogenesis. However, the unspecific tropism of BKPyV and the lack of in vitro models of BKPyV-infected prostate cells cast doubt on this hypothesis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether BKPyV could (a) infect normal and/or tumoral epithelial prostate cells and (b) affect their phenotype. Normal epithelial prostate RWPE-1 cells and PCa PC-3 cells were infected with BKPyV for 21 days. Cell proliferation, cytokine production, adhesion, invasion ability, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were analyzed. Our results show that (a) RWPE-1 and PC-3 cells are both infectable with BKPyV, but the outcome of the infection varies, (b) cell proliferation and TNF-α production were increased in BKPyV-infected RWPE-1, but not in PC-3 cells, (c) adhesion to matrigel and invasion abilities were elevated in BKPyV-infected RWPE-1 cells, and (d) loss of E-cadherin and expression of vimentin occurred in both uninfected and infected RWPE-1 cells. In conclusion, BKPyV may change some features of the normal prostate cells but is not needed for maintaining the transformed phenotype in the PCa cells The fact that RWPE-1 cells exhibit some phenotype modifications related to EMT represents a limit of this in vitro model.""","""['Sonia Villani', 'Nicoletta Gagliano', 'Patrizia Procacci', 'Patrizia Sartori', 'Manola Comar', 'Maurizio Provenzano', 'Evaldo Favi', 'Mariano Ferraresso', 'Pasquale Ferrante', 'Serena Delbue']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Polyomavirus BK and prostate cancer: a complex interaction of potential clinical relevance.', 'The human fetal glial cell line SVG p12 contains infectious BK polyomavirus.', 'Polyomavirus Hominis 1(BK virus) Infection in Prostatic Tissues: Cancer versus Hyperplasia.', 'BK Polyomavirus Infection and Renourinary Tumorigenesis.', 'BK polyomavirus infection promotes growth and aggressiveness in bladder cancer.', 'The Role of The Tumor Microbiome in Tumor Development and Its Treatment.', 'Prostate Microbiota and Prostate Cancer: A New Trend in Treatment.', 'Pharmacological Modulation of Steroid Activity in Hormone-Dependent Breast and Prostate Cancers: Effect of Some Plant Extract Derivatives.', 'Identification of Key Biomarkers in Bladder Cancer: Evidence from a Bioinformatics Analysis.']"""

Studies indicate the value of adding an early image of the pelvis to the imaging protocol of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan showed contradictory results. In this study we planned to assess the significance of an additional early imaging in 68Ga-PSMA-I&T PET/CT imaging in prostate cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   A total of 35 prostate cancer patients referred to 68Ga-PSMA-I&T PET/CT imaging for restaging of the disease due to suspicion of relapse after definitive therapy were enrolled. First an early static pelvic image was obtained at a maximum of 300s following injection of the radiotracer. Sixty minutes postinjection a whole-body PET/CT scan was conducted with an emission time of 3min per bed position. The lesions which were categorized as local recurrence, bone lesion and lymph node metástasis in the early images, were compared with the late images in terms of number of lesions detected and SUVmax values.  Results: 68Ga-PSMA-I&T PET/CT was positive in 23 of 35 patients (65.7%). A pathological uptake was observed in the prostatic bed site, in the pelvic lymph nodes, and in the bones in 17 patients (48.5%), 12 patients (34.2%), and 13 patients (37.1%), respectively. In one patient, focal pathological increased uptake in the prostatic bed with a SUVmax value of 5.8 was detected but this lesion disappeared in the late images. The average SUVmax values of the lesions in the prostatic bed were 13.7±12.1 versus 26.3±23.8 in the 5min and 60min studies respectively (p<0.001). In one patient, the pathological uptake in the lymph node in the early study cleared in the late study, whereas in another accumulation of activity was detected in a pelvic lymph node in the late study, while there was no lymph node detected in the early study. The average SUVmax values of the lymph nodes were 12.1±8.8 versus 26.3±22.6 in the 5min and 60min studies respectively (p<0.001). The average SUVmax values of the bone lesions were 11.4±6.9 versus 15±10.7 in the 5min and 60min studies respectively.  Conclusion:   Our study is the first in the literature to evaluate the impact of adding an early static pelvic image to the 68Ga-PSMA-I&T scan, in the detection rate of the lesions. Although there was no marked discordance between the 2sets of images, the addition of an early image to the imaging protocol of 68Ga-PSMA-I&T scan would increase the efficacy of detection of malignant lesions in the pelvis, which might show rapid clearance and has the risk of being masked by the urinary system activity.""","""['F Özülker']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Rev Esp Med Nucl Imagen Mol (Engl Ed)""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Early dynamic imaging in 68Ga- PSMA-11 PET/CT allows discrimination of urinary bladder activity and prostate cancer lesions.', 'Distribution of prostate cancer recurrences on gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (68 Ga-PSMA) positron-emission/computed tomography after radical prostatectomy with pathological node-positive extended lymph node dissection.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Importance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in hospital practice.

We compared prostate cancer detection rates for men who did and did not undergo prebiopsy MRI and evaluated treatment patterns based on biopsy approach, year of biopsy, and proximity to early adopters.  Methods:   Using private insurance claims (2009-2015), we identified men who underwent prostate biopsy using appropriate procedure codes. Exposure was receipt of prebiopsy MRI within 3 months prior to biopsy. Outcomes included new prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment with prostatectomy/radiation, and receipt of adjunct procedures typically used for higher-risk disease (i.e., lymphadenectomy with prostatectomy, androgen deprivation therapy with radiation). Hierarchical mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression predicted probabilities of each outcome.  Results:   We identified 77,350 men (mean age 57.5 ± 5.4 years) who underwent biopsy with 12% having had a prior negative biopsy. Use of prebiopsy MRI was more common among men biopsied from 2014 to 2015 (4.4% vs. 1.3% 2012-2013), in metropolitan statistical areas (2.6% vs. 1.1% not), residing close to early adopters (5.5% vs. 1.5% far), and with prior negative biopsy (7.3% vs. 1.7% biopsy-naïve; all P < 0.001). Compared to patients with a prior negative biopsy and no MRI, men were more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer if they had a prior negative biopsy and MRI (24.7% vs. 21.4% prior negative without MRI, odds ratio 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.51) or an initial biopsy without prior MRI (40.0% vs. 21.4% prior negative without MRI, odds ratio 2.49, 95% confidence interval 2.36-2.64; P < 0.001). Predicted probability of treatment overall and adjunct treatment did not differ based on receipt of pre-biopsy MRI.

Design, setting, and participants:   We describe and video-illustrate commonly performed pelvic reconstructive techniques in RARP, as performed by experts in the field.  Surgical procedure:   Surgical techniques have been described, such as posterior musculofascial reconstruction, anterior reconstruction and periurethral suspension, preservation of membranous urethral lengthening, bladder-neck reconstruction, and combinations.  Measurements:   An overview of continence rates of the different techniques is given.  Results and limitations:   All reconstructive surgical techniques result in similar short-term continence rates and good-to-excellent outcomes 1yr after surgery. There are only a few randomized clinical trials comparing a reconstructive technique with ""no reconstruction"" or a different reconstructive technique, and outcomes are conflicting.  Conclusions:   Although many of the procedures report a benefit with respect to early continence, benefits seem to diminish with longer follow-up.

It can be delivered immediately after surgery as adjuvant treatment, or after biochemical PSA failure as salvage treatment. There is currently a lack of consensus regarding whether salvage RT in the event of biochemical failure or immediate adjuvant RT is the optimal postprostatectomy RT treatment. Although both types of postprostatectomy RT are generally well tolerated, patients may develop some toxicity that can impact their quality of life and the duration and frequency of treatments can be challenging for patients. It is imperative that patients be provided with evidence-based information so that they are able to make a treatment decision most aligned with their values.  Methods:   To help address patients' informational needs, an online education resource was created for patients with prostate cancer considering postoperative RT. Patients and their families were asked to evaluate the effectiveness of this resource using a validated purpose-based information assessment.  Results:   Nineteen patients were approached and 14 participated, but only five patients returned their evaluations (35%). Sixty percent found the information to be important with regards to each of the six commonly identified purposes in the purpose-based information assessment: organizing, understanding, decision-making, planning, emotional support, and discussing. Only one participant found the information hard to understand and had difficulty finding specific information.  Discussion:   Patients should be encouraged to actively participate in their treatment decision-making process involving postprostatectomy RT. For patients to make well-informed decisions, patients must be provided with clear and accessible information so that they may understand their disease and the treatment options.  Conclusion:   An online education resource has been developed that most study respondents found clear and helpful for a variety of identified purposes. Overall, this online education resource has the potential to reach a large number of patients and their caregivers who desire specific information and involvement in future treatment decisions.""","""['Katija Bonin', 'Merrylee McGuffin', 'Eli Lechtman', 'Aaron Cumal', 'Tamara Harth', 'Eirena Calabrese', 'Deb Feldman-Stewart', 'Julie Burnett', 'Janet Ellis', 'Lisa Di Prospero', 'Ewa Szumacher']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Sci""","""['Management of prostate cancer patients following radiation therapy after radical surgery referred from urology to radiation oncology departments in Spain.', 'Use of Postprostatectomy Radiation Therapy at an NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Radiation therapy after radical prostatectomy: a review of the issues and options.']"""

Confirmation using radical prostatectomy specimens is the most reliable method for verifying the accuracy of template-guided transperineal prostate biopsy. The study aimed to reveal the spatial distribution of prostate cancer in template-guided transperineal saturation biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.  Methods:   Between December 2012 to December 2016, 171 patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer via template-guided transperineal prostate biopsy and subsequently underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The spatial distributions of prostate cancer were analyzed and the consistency of the tumor distribution between biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens were compared.  Results:   The positive rate of biopsy in the apex region was significantly higher than that of the other biopsy regions (43% vs 28%, P < 0.01). In radical prostatectomy specimens, the positive rate was highest at the region 0.9-1.3 cm above the apex, and it had a tendency to decrease towards the base. There was a significant difference in the positive rate between the cephalic and caudal half of the prostate (68% vs 99%, P < 0.01). There were no significant differences between the anterior and posterior zones for either biopsy or radical prostatectomy specimens.  Conclusion:   The tumor spatial distribution generated by template-guided transperineal prostate biopsy was consistent with that of radical prostatectomy specimens in general.

Here, we showed that a lncRNA, Breast-Cancer Anti-Estrogen Resistance 4 (BCAR4), which plays a pivotal role in the tamoxifen-resistance of breast cancer, was significantly upregulated in CRPC, but not in castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC), compared to normal prostate tissue. High BCAR4 levels in CRPC were correlated with poor patients' overall survival. Androgen increased growth and migration of androgen receptor (AR)-positive PC346 cells, which was abolished by the antagonist of androgen. Overexpression of BCAR4 in PC346 cells increased cell growth and migration, but turned the cells insensitive to androgen. On the other hand, growth and migration of AR-negative DU145 cells are insensitive to androgen, while depletion of BCAR4 in DU145 cells not only decreased cell growth, but also turned the cells sensitive again to androgen. Moreover, BCAR4 activated GLI2 downstream genes, and correlated with the levels of these GLI2-target genes in CRPC. Depletion of GLI2 abolished the effects of BCAR4 on cell growth and migration.

The well-controlled glycation resulting in the production of early glycation products (EGPs) has been proposed as a strategy to improve the physicochemical properties of food proteins. However, the health effects of EGPs are unknown. It has been shown that the Western diet (glycation prone) is associated with a higher mortality in prostate cancer (PCa) patients than the prudent diet; therefore, the role of EGPs in prostate tumorigenesis is investigated.  Methods and results:   C57BL/6 male mice are treated with the vehicle (water), non-reacted samples, EGPs, and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) by gavage. EGPs (600 mg kg-1 body weight per day) promoted the growth of subcutaneously transplanted TRAMP-C2 PCa cells the most among these groups. Significantly, increases in the circulation monocytes and tumor-associated M2 macrophages are observed in EGP-treated mice, and the M2/M1 ratio is also increased in the EGP group when compared to that of water and AGEs.

After the deployment of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) surveys in routine outpatient workflows at an academic cancer center, electronic health record data were used to evaluate survey completion rates and self-reported global health measures across 2 tumor types: breast and prostate cancer.  Methods:   This study retrospectively analyzed 11,657 PROMIS surveys from patients with breast cancer and 4411 surveys from patients with prostate cancer, and it calculated survey completion rates and global physical health (GPH) and global mental health (GMH) scores between 2013 and 2018.  Results:   A total of 36.6% of eligible patients with breast cancer and 23.7% of patients with prostate cancer completed at least 1 survey, with completion rates lower among black patients for both tumor types (P < .05). The mean T scores (calibrated to a general population mean of 50) for GPH were 48.4 ± 9 for breast cancer and 50.6 ± 9 for prostate cancer, and the GMH scores were 52.7 ± 8 and 52.1 ± 9, respectively. GPH and GMH were frequently lower among ethnic minorities, patients without private health insurance, and those with advanced disease.  Conclusions:   This analysis provides important baseline data on patient-reported global health in breast and prostate cancer. Demonstrating that PROs can be integrated into clinical workflows, this study shows that supportive efforts may be needed to improve PRO collection and global health endpoints in vulnerable populations.""","""['Martin G Seneviratne', 'Selen Bozkurt', 'Manali I Patel', 'Tina Seto', 'James D Brooks', 'Douglas W Blayney', 'Allison W Kurian', 'Tina Hernandez-Boussard']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Diverse patient trajectories during cytotoxic chemotherapy: Capturing longitudinal patient-reported outcomes.', 'Patient-Reported Health-Related Quality-of-Life Assessment at the Point-of-Care with Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer.', 'Accuracy of Linking VR-12 and PROMIS Global Health Scores in Clinical Practice.', 'Two-item PROMIS® global physical and mental health scales.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Benefits of nature-based walking for breast cancer survivors.', 'Patient-reported distress at a cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'The predictive value of patient-reported outcomes on the impact of breast cancer treatment-related quality of life.', 'The development and initial validation of the PROMIS®+HF-27 and PROMIS+HF-10 profiles.', 'Machine Learning Applied to Electronic Health Records: Identification of Chemotherapy Patients at High Risk for Preventable Emergency Department Visits and Hospital Admissions.']"""

CRPC tumors develop resistance to new-generation antiandrogen enzalutamide through lineage plasticity, characterized by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a basal-like phenotype. FOXA1 is a transcription factor essential for epithelial lineage differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that FOXA1 loss leads to remarkable upregulation of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFB3), which encodes a ligand of the TGF-β pathway. Mechanistically, this is due to genomic occupancy of FOXA1 on an upstream enhancer of the TGFB3 gene to directly inhibit its transcription. Functionally, FOXA1 downregulation induces TGF-β signaling, EMT, and cell motility, which is effectively blocked by the TGF-β receptor I inhibitor galunisertib (LY2157299). Tissue microarray analysis confirmed reduced levels of FOXA1 protein and a concordant increase in TGF-β signaling, indicated by SMAD2 phosphorylation, in CRPC as compared with primary tumors. Importantly, combinatorial LY2157299 treatment sensitized PC cells to enzalutamide, leading to synergistic effects in inhibiting cell invasion in vitro and xenograft CRPC tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Therefore, our study establishes FOXA1 as an important regulator of lineage plasticity mediated in part by TGF-β signaling, and supports a novel therapeutic strategy to control lineage switching and potentially extend clinical response to antiandrogen therapies.""","""['Bing Song', 'Su-Hong Park', 'Jonathan C Zhao', 'Ka-Wing Fong', 'Shangze Li', 'Yongik Lee', 'Yeqing A Yang', 'Subhasree Sridhar', 'Xiaodong Lu', 'Sarki A Abdulkadir', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Timothy M Kuzel', 'William Catalona', 'Ximing Yang', 'Jindan Yu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['Re: Targeting FOXA1-Mediated Repression of TGF-β Signaling Suppresses Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'TGF-β receptor I inhibitor enhances response to enzalutamide in a pre-clinical model of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Selective targeting of PARP-2 inhibits androgen receptor signaling and prostate cancer growth through disruption of FOXA1 function.', 'Androgen receptor-independent function of FoxA1 in prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Clinical development of galunisertib (LY2157299 monohydrate), a small molecule inhibitor of transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'GATA2 co-opts TGFβ1/SMAD4 oncogenic signaling and inherited variants at 6q22 to modulate prostate cancer progression.', 'Radiogenomic profiling of prostate tumors prior to external beam radiotherapy converges on a transcriptomic signature of TGF-β activity driving tumor recurrence.', 'The DACH1 gene is frequently deleted in prostate cancer, restrains prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, decreases DNA damage repair, and predicts therapy responses.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the FOXA1-related ceRNA network and identification of the MAGI2-AS3/DUSP2 axis as a prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer.', 'Epigenomic mapping identifies an enhancer repertoire that regulates cell identity in bladder cancer through distinct transcription factor networks.']"""

We investigated the effect of socioeconomic and early QOL and psychological factors on disease-free time and survival in localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   A consecutive sample of patients with localized prostate cancer (T1-3, N0, M0) treated with external beam radiotherapy completed validated questionnaires on coping with cancer (the Ways of Coping Questionnaire WOC-CA), anger expression (the Anger Expression Scale), life events (the Life Experience Survey), and various aspects of QOL (the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the Depression Scale DEPS, the EORTC QLQ-C30, the LENT-SOMA outcome measure) approximately 4.5 months after diagnosis. Cox regression analyses were used to determine the predictors of the disease-free and overall survival times measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of a PSA-relapse and date of death.  Results:   After controlling for biological prognostic factors, age, and adjuvant hormonal therapies, moderate and high socioeconomic status and an increased level of pain predicted longer survival, whereas an increased level of prostate-area symptoms and fatigue and, especially, reports of no/few physical symptoms were predictors of a shorter survival time. A longer PSA-relapse-free time was predicted by Cognitive Avoidance/Denial coping, whereas problems in social functioning, hopelessness, and an excellent self-reported QOL predicted a shorter PSA-relapse-free time.  Conclusions:   Higher socioeconomic status was prognostic for longer survival, as previously reported. Patients with a seemingly good QOL (few physical complaints, excellent self-reported QOL) had poorer prognoses. This association may due to the survival decreasing effect of emotional non-expression; patients with high emotional non-expression may over-report their wellbeing in simple measures, and thus actually be in need of extra attention and care.""","""['Ulla-Sisko Lehto', 'Markku Ojanen', 'Anna Väkevä', 'Tadeusz Dyba', 'Arpo Aromaa', 'Pirkko Kellokumpu-Lehtinen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Quality of life of men treated with brachytherapies for prostate cancer.', 'Baseline psychosocial predictors of survival in localized melanoma.', 'The relationship of changes in EORTC QLQ-C30 scores to ratings on the Subjective Significance Questionnaire in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life in patients with prostatic carcinoma: a review and results of a study in N+ disease.

The patient underwent radical prostatectomy, showed early tumor marker PSA recurrence and, one year after surgery, abiraterone resistance. Subcutaneous C5 tumors can be serially transplanted between mice and grow within ~90 days to 1.5-2 cm³ tumors in SCID Balb/c mice (take rate 100%), NOD-scid IL2Rgnull (NSG) mice (100%) and C57BL/6 pfp-/-/rag2-/- mice (66%). In contrast, no tumor growth is observed in female mice. C5 tumors can be cryopreserved and show the same growth characteristics in vivo afterwards. C5 tumor cells do not grow stably in vitro, neither under two- nor three-dimensional cell culture conditions. Upon serial transplantation, some C5 tumors spontaneously disseminated to distant sites with an observable trend towards higher metastatic cell loads in scid compared to NSG mice. Lung metastases could be verified by histology by means of anti-PSMA immunohistochemistry, exclusively demonstrating single disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and micro-metastases. Upon surgical resection of the primary tumors, such pulmonary foci rarely grew out to multi-cellular metastatic colonies despite doubled overall survival span. In the brain and bone marrow, the metastatic cell load present at surgery even disappeared during the post-surgical period. We provide shallow whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing data of C5 tumors demonstrating the copy number aberration/ mutation status of this PCa model and proving genomic stability over several passages.

However, despite the diversity of tumor-initiating cells, most prostate cancer cells express the androgen receptor (AR) and depend on androgens for their growth and expansion, implicating an essential role of androgen signaling in prostate tumorigenesis. Prostatic basal cells express p63 and are able to differentiate into luminal, neuroendocrine, and basal cells. Here, we directly assessed the essential role of androgen signaling in prostatic p63-expressing cell initiated oncogenic transformation and tumor formation. Using novel and relevant mouse models, we demonstrated that, with stabilized β-catenin expression, prostatic p63-expressing cells possess the ability to initiate oncogenic transformation and, in the presence of androgens, they further transdifferentiate into luminal-like tumor cells and develop adenocarcinomas. Castration prior to activating stabilized β-catenin sensitizes p63-expressing cells and increases their sensitivity to androgens, resulting in aggressive and fast growing tumor phenotypes. These findings are consistent with what have been observed in human prostate cancers, demonstrating an essential role for androgen signaling in prostate cancer initiation and progression.

However, clinicians need a better understanding of its accuracy and limitations in detecting individual CaP foci to optimize management.  Objective:   To determine the per-lesion detection rate for CaP foci by mpMRI and identify predictors of tumor detection.  Design, setting, and participants:   We carried out a retrospective analysis of a prospectively managed database correlating lesion-specific results from mpMRI co-registered with whole-mount pathology (WMP) prostatectomy specimens from June 2010 to February 2018. Participants include 588 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven CaP undergoing 3-T mpMRI before radical prostatectomy at a single tertiary institution.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We measured mpMRI sensitivity in detecting individual CaP and clinically significant (any Gleason score ≥7) CaP foci and predictors of tumor detection using multivariate analysis.  Results and limitations:   The final analysis included 1213 pathologically confirmed tumor foci in 588 patients with primarily intermediate- (75%) or high-risk (12%) CaP. mpMRI detected 45% of all lesions (95% confidence interval [CI] 42-47%), including 65% of clinically significant lesions (95% CI 61-69%) and nearly 80% of high-grade tumors. Some 74% and 31% of missed solitary and multifocal tumors, respectively, were clinically significant. The majority of missed lesions were small (61.1% ≤1cm); 28.3% were between 1 and 2cm, and 10.4% were >2cm. mpMRI missed at least one clinically significant focus in 34% of patients overall, and in 45% of men with multifocal lesions. On multivariate analysis, smaller, low-grade, multifocal, nonindex tumors with lower prostate-specific antigen density were more likely to be missed. Limitations include selection bias in a prostatectomy cohort, lack of specificity data, an imperfect co-registration process, and uncertain clinical significance for undetected lesions.  Conclusions:   mpMRI detects less than half of all and less than two-thirds of clinically significant CaP foci.

Methods:   We reviewed the medical records of 60 patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC at Renji Hospital who were treated with AA plus prednisone (n = 43) or prednisone alone (n = 17). All patients were assessed for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, PSA progression-free survival (PSA PFS), radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and overall survival (OS). The ability of several parameters to predict PSA PFS, rPFS, and OS was studied.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 14.0 months (range 7.0-18.5 months), at which time 19 death events had been reported: 11 in the AA + prednisone group and 8 in the prednisone group. The AA + prednisone group had significantly longer median PSA PFS (10.3 vs 3.0 months, P < 0.001), rPFS (13.9 vs 3.9 months, P < 0.001), and OS (23.3 vs 17.5 months, P = 0.016) than the prednisone-alone group. The most frequently reported grade 3 or 4 adverse event in both the AA + prednisone and prednisone-alone groups was elevated alanine aminotransferase level in 5 of 43 patients (11.6%) and 2 of 17 patients (11.8%), respectively. No adverse events led to discontinuation of therapy. In multivariate analysis, time from androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to castration resistance of ≤18 months was a determinant of shorter OS (P = 0.007).

We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of renal transplant recipients between 2003 and 2016 at a single tertiary center, and identified four patients with high serum PSA level during regular follow-up, 1-108 months after primary renal transplantation. The mean age of patients with detected high serum PSA level with 9.25µg/l median was 59.05 years. All four patients had functioning grafts. To prove prostate cancer, they underwent trans-rectal prostate biopsy, with no complications. Histological evaluation identified prostate adenocarcinoma (Gleason 6-7, stage T1-2cN0M0) in three patients. The biopsy in the fourth patient was negative and he therefore had trans-urethral prostate resection. Histological evaluation of resected prostate tissue revealed prostate adenocarcinoma (Gleason 7, 4+3). All patients began treatment with androgen deprivation therapy. Three patients were indicated for permanent prostate brachytherapy (BT) with iodine-125 (125I) seeds and the trans-urethral resection patient was referred for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). After a mean follow-up of 49 months (range, 30-73), all patients, irrespective of type of radiotherapy, were in complete clinical and biochemical remission, with undetectable PSA levels. The kidney grafts remained functional, with a mean creatinine level of 99 µmol/l (range 64-123) and a glomerular filtration rate of 1.17 ml/s/1.73 m2 (range, 0.89-1.59). Radiation-induced late adverse effects were reported in two BT patients; one had clinically significant urine incontinency and the other suffered urethral stricture. Localized prostate tumor was identified in all reported patients, and all received radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation. All patients were disease-free at the time of the last follow-up.

However, the impact of those uncertainties on the biological effect of protons has not been specifically considered. In this study, we added biological effect-based objectives into a conventional RO cost function for IMPT optimization to minimize the variation in biological effect. One brain tumor case, one prostate tumor case and one head & neck tumor case were selected for this study. Three plans were generated for each case using three different optimization approaches: planning target volume (PTV)-based optimization, conventional RO, and RO incorporating biological effect (BioRO). In BioRO, the variation in biological effect caused by IMPT delivery uncertainties was minimized for voxels in both target volumes and critical structures, in addition to a conventional voxel-based worst-case RO objective function. The biological effect was approximated by the product of dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET) and physical dose. All plans were normalized to give the same target dose coverage, assuming a constant relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1. Dose, biological effect, and their uncertainties were evaluated and compared among the three optimization approaches for each patient case. Compared with PTV-based plans, RO plans achieved more robust target dose coverage and reduced biological effect hot spots in critical structures near the target. Moreover, with their sustained robust dose distributions, BioRO plans not only reduced variations in biological effect in target and normal tissues but also further reduced biological effect hot spots in critical structures compared with RO plans. Our findings indicate that IMPT could benefit from the use of conventional RO, which would reduce the biological effect in normal tissues and produce more robust dose distributions than those of PTV-based optimization. More importantly, this study provides a proof of concept that incorporating biological effect uncertainty gap into conventional RO would not only control the IMPT plan robustness in terms of physical dose and biological effect but also achieve further reduction of biological effect in normal tissues.""","""['Xuemin Bai', 'Gino Lim', 'David Grosshans', 'Radhe Mohan', 'Wenhua Cao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'PTV-based IMPT optimization incorporating planning risk volumes vs robust optimization.', 'Robust optimization for intensity-modulated proton therapy with soft spot sensitivity regularization.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Robust Proton Treatment Planning: Physical and Biological Optimization.', 'Virtual particle Monte Carlo: A new concept to avoid simulating secondary particles in proton therapy dose calculation.', 'Reformulated McNamara RBE-weighted beam orientation optimization for intensity modulated proton therapy.', 'A Critical Review of LET-Based Intensity-Modulated Proton Therapy Plan Evaluation and Optimization for Head and Neck Cancer Management.', 'A Review of the Robust Optimization Process and Advances with Monte Carlo in the Proton Therapy Management of Head and Neck Tumors.', 'Advances in radiotherapy technology for pediatric cancer patients and roles of medical physicists: COG and SIOP Europe perspectives.']"""

However, little information is available to describe and compare population-level hospital use across cancer types. Our aim was to estimate unplanned hospitalization rates and to describe the reasons for hospitalization in a population-based cohort recently diagnosed with cancer.  Materials and methods:   California Cancer Registry data linked with administrative inpatient data were used to examine unplanned hospitalization among individuals diagnosed with cancer between 2009 and 2012 (n = 412,850). Hospitalizations for maintenance chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or planned surgery were excluded. Multistate models were used to estimate age-adjusted unplanned hospitalization rates, accounting for survival.  Results:   Approximately 67% of hospitalizations in the year after diagnosis were unplanned, 35% of newly diagnosed individuals experienced an unplanned hospitalization, and 67% of unplanned hospitalizations originated in the emergency department (ED). Nonmalignancy principal diagnoses most frequently associated with unplanned hospitalization included infection (15.8%) and complications of a medical device or care (6.5%). Unplanned hospitalization rates were highest for individuals with hepatobiliary or pancreatic cancer (2.08 unplanned hospitalizations per person-year at risk), lung cancer (1.58 unplanned hospitalizations), and brain or CNS cancer (1.47 unplanned hospitalizations), and were lowest among individuals with prostate cancer (0.18 unplanned hospitalizations) and melanoma (0.25 unplanned hospitalizations).  Conclusion:   The population burden of unplanned hospitalization among individuals newly diagnosed with cancer is substantial. Many unplanned hospitalizations originate in the ED and are associated with potentially preventable admission diagnoses.

Methods:   Men undergoing prostate biopsy completed a questionnaire and metabolic equivalent (MET) hours of exercise was calculated. Of 695 men, 349 had PC; 161 low-grade, and 188 high-grade. We assessed the link between exercise and PC risk, high-grade PC (Gleason 7-10), and low-grade PC (Gleason 2-6) using logistic and multinomial logistic regression. Analysis was stratified by BMI.

INSM1 has been identified in multiple tumors of NE or neuroepithelial origin, whereas OTP expression has been mainly studied in NE tumors of pulmonary origin. Expression of OTP appears to correlate with poorer prognosis in pulmonary carcinoids; however, its expression patterns in other NE/neuroepithelial tumors need further investigation. Here, we assessed the diagnostic utility of INSM1 and OTP in tumors with NE differentiation at relatively uncommon sites including prostate, breast, and tumors of gynecologic origin. Thirty-two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cases were used to construct a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemistry for INSM1 and OTP was performed and scored semi-quantitatively. INSM1 was diffusely expressed in 60% of gynecologic tumors, 71.4% of mammary carcinoma, and 25% of prostate adenocarcinoma with NE differentiation. Diffuse expression of OTP was detected in 50% of prostate adenocarcinoma with NE differentiation and 100% neuroendocrine carcinoma of the ovary. Immunostain for achaete-scute homolog 1, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 supported the NE and/or neuroepithelial differentiation of the tumors. In summary, INSM1 is expressed in most of the tumors with NE and neuroepithelial differentiation in this study, confirming the diagnostic utility of INSM1 as a novel and sensitive marker of NE/neuroepithelial differentiation. The expression of OTP in some NE tumors outside of lung expands the spectrum of tumors that may express this biomarker and should be considered when working up a NE tumor of unknown primary site.""","""['Madhuchhanda Roy', 'Darya G Buehler', 'Ranran Zhang', 'Michael L Schwalbe', 'Rebecca M Baus', 'M Shahriar Salamat', 'Ricardo V Lloyd', 'Jason N Rosenbaum']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Endocr Pathol""","""['Immunohistochemical analysis of OTP and NKX6.1 in neuroendocrine tumors of the lung and pancreas.', 'Insulinoma-associated protein 1 immunostaining on cytology specimens: an institutional experience.', 'Insulinoma-associated protein 1 is a sensitive and specific marker for lung neuroendocrine tumors in cytologic and surgical specimens.', 'Diagnostic Value of Insulinoma-Associated Protein 1 (INSM1) and Comparison With Established Neuroendocrine Markers in Pulmonary Cancers.', 'Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1): a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for neuroendocrine tumors.', 'Orthopedia homeobox protein (OTP) in the diagnostic and prognostic workup of pulmonary carcinoid tumors.', 'Expression of novel neuroendocrine markers in breast carcinomas: a study of INSM1, ASCL1, and\xa0POU2F3.', 'Molecular Subtypes of Extra-pulmonary Neuroendocrine Carcinomas Identified by the Expression of Neuroendocrine Lineage-Specific Transcription Factors.', 'Differential Orthopedia Homeobox expression in pulmonary carcinoids is associated with changes in DNA methylation.', ""INSM1, a Novel Biomarker for Detection of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Cytopathologists' View.""]"""

In pre-clinical research, the formula demonstrated selective anti-cancer effects, in part as a result of radical oxygen species (ROS) activity of the botanical components. The present study examined the interaction between LCS101 and radiation therapy on cancer cell lines.  Methods:   Incremental doses of LCS101 were added to breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), prostate (DU145), transitional cell bladder carcinoma (T24), pancreatic epithelioid carcinoma (PANC-1), and osteosarcoma (U20S) cell lines 4 h after single-dose irradiation (range 0.5-4 Gy). Cell viability was tested using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay after 1 week, with ROS activity examined using 1 mM of the ROS scavenger sodium pyruvate (ROS scavenger), testing cell viability with an SRB assay.  Results:   The addition of LCS101 to MCF7 (breast) and DU-145 (prostate) cancer cell lines resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the antiproliferative effects of radiation treatment. The addition of pyruvate inhibited radiation-induced cell death in all of the cell lines treated with LCS101.  Conclusions:   The addition of the botanical formula LCS101 to irradiated cancer cells results in an apparent additive effect, most likely through a ROS-mediated mechanism.

No consensus exists regarding which of the three available techniques of TB should be preferred.  Objective:   To compare detection rates of overall PCa and clinically significant PCa (csPCa) for the three MRI-based TB techniques.  Design, setting, and participants:   Multicenter randomised controlled trial, including 665 men with prior negative SB and a persistent suspicion of PCa, conducted between 2014 and 2017 in two nonacademic teaching hospitals and an academic hospital.  Intervention:   All patients underwent 3-T mpMRI evaluated with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) version 2. If imaging demonstrated PIRADS ≥3 lesions, patients were randomised 1:1:1 for one TB technique: MRI-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion TB (FUS-TB), cognitive registration TRUS TB (COG-TB), or in-bore MRI TB (MRI-TB).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary (overall PCa detection) and secondary (csPCa detection [Gleason score ≥3+4]) outcomes were compared using Pearson chi-square test.  Results and limitations:   On mpMRI, 234/665 (35%) patients had PIRADS ≥3 lesions and underwent TB. There were no significant differences in the detection rates of overall PCa (FUS-TB 49%, COG-TB 44%, MRI-TB 55%, p=0.4). PCa detection rate differences were -5% between FUS-TB and MRI-TB (p=0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] -21% to 11%), 6% between FUS-TB and COG-TB (p=0.5, 95% CI -10% to 21%), and -11% between COG-TB and MRI-TB (p=0.17, 95% CI -26% to 5%). There were no significant differences in the detection rates of csPCa (FUS-TB 34%, COG-TB 33%, MRI-TB 33%, p>0.9). Differences in csPCa detection rates were 2% between FUS-TB and MRI-TB (p=0.8, 95% CI -13% to 16%), 1% between FUS-TB and COG-TB (p>0.9, 95% CI -14% to 16%), and 1% between COG-TB and MRI-TB (p>0.9, 95% CI -14% to 16%). The main study limitation was a low rate of PIRADS ≥3 lesions on mpMRI, causing underpowering for primary outcome.

We aim to evaluate the preferences and practice trends among urologists regarding this treatment strategy.  Methods:   A 20 item online questionnaire was designed to collect information on urologists' views and use of FT. The survey was sent to the members of the Endourological Society and the American Urological Association. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine predictors for utilization of FT.  Results:   A total of 425 responses were received [American Urological Association: 319, Endourological Society: 106]. Mean age of respondents was 53(SD: 11.3) years. Although half of the respondents (50.8%) believed FT to be moderate to extremely beneficial in the treatment of CaP, only 24.2% (103) of the respondents currently utilize FT in their practice. Respondents who were fellowship trained in urologic oncology were more likely to consider FT to be at least moderately beneficial (P < 0.001). Surgeon's experience (greater than 15 years in urology practice) (P = 0.025) and seeing more than 10 patients with new CaP diagnosis per month (P = 0.002) were independent predictors of FT utilization for localized CaP. While the most common setting for utilization of FT was in patients with unilateral intermediate-risk (72.8%) CaP, a small percentage of respondents also used FT for patients with unilateral high-risk CaP and bilateral intermediate risk (21.4% and 10.7%, respectively). Most common reasons for not using FT were the lack of belief in 'index lesion theory' (63.2%), lack of experience (41.3%), lack of belief in FT's efficacy (41.1%), lack of infrastructure (35.8%), difficult salvage treatment in cases of recurrence (22.7%) and high cost (21.8%). About 57.6% would use FT more often in an office or outpatient setting if they had access to reliable and cost-effective options.  Conclusions:   Only a quarter of our respondents utilize FT in their practice with surgeon's experience being the important independent predictor for using FT. Majority of respondents though consider FT to be beneficial in CaP management, would use it more often if provided more reliable and cost-effective options. Over time, experience and accessibility to reliable methods to perform FT may lead to further utilization of this novel treatment strategy.""","""['Amit L Jain', 'Abhinav Sidana', 'Mahir Maruf', 'Dordaneh Sugano', 'Brian Calio', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Peter A Pinto']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Current beliefs and practice patterns among urologists regarding prostate magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance-targeted biopsy.', 'Cryosurgery, an alternative treatment option for organ-confined prostate cancer: current beliefs and practice patterns of urologists.', ""Prostate MRI: a national survey of Urologist's attitudes and perceptions."", 'Anaphylactoid Reactions After Instillation of Contrast Material Into the Urinary Tract: A Survey of Contemporary Practice Patterns and Review of the Literature.', 'Making a case ""against"" focal therapy for intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Stem Cells as Target for Prostate cancer Therapy: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Transperineal prostate biopsy identifies locations of clinically significant prostate cancer in men considering focal therapy with PI-RADS 3-5 regions of interest.', 'Does mpMRI guidance improve HIFU partial gland ablation compared to conventional ultrasound guidance?

The aim of this study was to understand the prognostic role of preoperative serum ChE in patients with radiation-recurrent prostate cancer (CaP) treated with salvage radical prostatectomy (SRP).  Material and methods:   This retrospective study included 214 patients with radiation-recurrent CaP treated with SRP from January 2007 to December 2015 at 5 academic centers. Patients were considered with abnormal/decreased ChE levels if <5 kU/l. Biochemical recurrence-free and metastases-free (MFS) survival analyses were performed.  Results:   Median serum ChE level was 6.9 (interquartile range) 6-7.7) kU/l. Serum ChE level (<5 kU/l) was decreased in 25 (11.7%) patients. Decreased serum ChE level was associated with lower body mass index (P = 0.006) and metastasis to lymph nodes (P = 0.004). In multivariable analysis, continuous ChE was an independent predictor of MFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48, confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.71, P < 0.001), overall survival (HR 0.68, CI 0.48-0.96, P = 0.03) and cancer-specific survival (HR 0.41, CI 0.2-0.84, P = 0.01). Serum ChE improved the C-index (by 2.54%) to 87.8% for prediction of overall survival and (by 3%) to 92% for prediction of MFS.

Nitrogen permease regulator-like 2 (NPRL2) is reported to be a tumor suppressor candidate gene and is closely related to the DNA repair pathway, which can affect the sensitivity of many chemotherapeutic drugs. However, there is no research on whether NPRL2 is associated with sensitivity to Olaparib. Hence, in the present study, we examined the NPRL2 expression levels in several PCa cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, and enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP, named LNPER) by Western blot. In addition, we investigated the role of NPRL2 expression and silencing in cell proliferation and in the regulation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which can mediate DNA repair and sensitivity to Olaparib. Furthermore, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine the mechanism of action of NPRL2 in adjusting Olaparib sensitivity. Our findings demonstrated that the NPRL2 expression level was upregulated in PCa cells, especially CRPC cells. NPRL2 overexpression promoted growth and resistance to Olaparib, and NPRL2 silencing inhibited proliferation, enhanced sensitivity to Olaparib, and increased CRRL2 expression in PCa cells. In addition, the Olaparib-induced growth delay in NPRL2-silenced PC3 tumors in mice correlated with ATM signaling downregulation, an apoptosis increase and migration/invasion suppression. Our results indicate that NPRL2 silencing enhances sensitivity to Olaparib treatment in CRPC and that NPRL2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target and predict resistance to Olaparib in CRPC.""","""['Xin Chen', 'Zhixiong Chen', 'Bin Zheng', 'Wei Tang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['NPRL2 enhances autophagy and the resistance to Everolimus in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'NPRL2 promotes docetaxel chemoresistance in castration resistant prostate cancer cells by regulating autophagy through the mTOR pathway.', 'Targeting Plk1 to Enhance Efficacy of Olaparib in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel Use of Olaparib for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Novel Targets and Precision Medicine for Prostate Cancer-Part 2: Tumor Profiling and Personalized Therapy in Patients With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'STL127705 synergize with olaparib in castration-resistant prostate cancer by inhibiting homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining repair.', 'Bioinformatics analysis of the prognostic and immunotherapeutic significance of NPRL2 in stomach adenocarcinoma.', 'A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen identifies novel PARP inhibitor resistance genes in prostate cancer.', 'Resistance Mechanisms to Taxanes and PARP Inhibitors in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'circ_0003418 Inhibits Tumorigenesis And Cisplatin Chemoresistance Through Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway In Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

The model was developed on the publically available Erasmus iCycle dataset in order to remove the effect of plan quality/inter-planner variability on the model's predictive capabilities. The model was used to predict anus, rectum, and bladder dose volume histograms. Two versions were developed: the n = 114 case (leave-one-out method) which made predictions using the complete Erasmus dataset, and the similarity index (SI)-based model which used a smaller training cohort allocated in order of geometric similarity determined using an overlap volume histogram-derived SI. The difference in mean dose (predicted-achieved) of the SI model at cohort sizes of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, and 100 was compared to the leave-one-out method for 5 patients, in an attempt to determine the ""optimum"" cohort size for the SI-based model in this dataset. Performance of the optimized SI model was compared to the leave-one-out method for all patients using the following metrics: difference in mean and median dose, difference in V65Gy and V75Gy (rectum only), similarity of predicted and achieved mean dose, and mean dose volume histograms residual.

Hence, alternative therapeutic strategies have been developed. The aim of the study was to evaluate a first-line salvage treatment with EMDA®-MMC in patients with HGNMIBC unresponsive to BCG.  Methods:   We carried out a prospective, single-center, single-arm Phase II study in order to evaluate the efficacy (in terms of recurrence and progression) and the safety of the EMDA®-MMC treatment in 26 (21 male, 5 female) consecutive patients with ""BCG refractory"" HGNMIBC on a 3 years follow-up. EMDA®-MMC treatment consisted of 40 mg of MMC diluted in 100 ml of sterile water retained in the bladder for 30 min with 20 mA pulsed electric current. EMDA®-MMC regimen consisted of an induction course of 6 weekly instillations followed by a maintenance course of 6 monthly instillations. Follow-up was performed with systematic mapping biopsies of the bladder (with sampling in the prostatic urethra for men), voiding and washing urinary cytology, radiological study of the upper urinary tract. We performed Survival Kaplan-Meier curves and Log-rank test in order to analyze high grade disease-free survival.  Results:   At the end of follow-up, 16 patients (61.5%) preserved their native bladder; 10 patients (38.4%) underwent radical cystectomy, in 6 patients (23.1%) for recurrent HGNMIBC and in 4 patients (15.4%) for progression to muscle-invasive disease. At the end of follow-up, stratifying patients based on TNM classification (TaG3, T1G3, Cis, TaT1G3 + Cis), disease-free rates were 75, 71.4, 50 and 25%, respectively; survival curves showed statistically significant differences (p value < 0.05). Regarding toxicity, we reported severe adverse systemic event of hypersensitivity to the MMC in 3 patients (11.5%), and local side effects in 6 patients (26.1%).

We propose that genes that control adult stem cell homeostasis in organs with slow turnover, such as the prostate, control cancer fate. One such gene, KLF4, overexpressed in murine prostate stem cells, regulates their homeostasis, blocks malignant transformation, and controls the self-renewal of tumor-initiating cells.

Materials and methods:   Patients with PCa underwent multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) on a 3-T MRI scanner before radical prostatectomy. Forty PCa index lesions were identified and outlined on histology by a pathologist. Two radiologists who were informed about the presence of PCa but were not aware of lesion outlines on histology worked in consensus to delineate PCa lesions on T2-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and early-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). The lesion volumes from different mpMRI sequences and the percentage of volume underestimation compared with pathology were calculated and correlated with volume at pathology. The repeated-measures ANOVA with the posthoc Bonferroni test was performed to evaluate whether the difference between the estimated tumor volumes was statistically significant.  Results:   The mean PCa lesion volume estimated from pathology, T2-weighted imaging, DWI (ADC maps), and DCE-MRI were 4.61 ± 4.99 (SD) cm3, 2.03 ± 2.96 cm3, 1.81 ± 2.76 cm3, and 3.48 ± 4.06 cm3, respectively. The lesion volumes on T2-weighted images (p = 0.000002), ADC maps (p = 0.000003), and DCE-MR images (p = 0.004412) were significantly lower than those from pathology. PCa lesion volume was significantly underestimated on T2-weighted images, ADC maps, and DCE-MR images compared with pathology by 54.98% ± 22.60% (mean ± SD), 58.59% ± 18.58%, and 18.33% ± 30.11%, respectively; underestimation using T2-weighted imaging (p = 1.01 × 10-11) and DWI (p = 2.94 × 10-11) was significantly higher than underestimation using DCE-MRI. Correlations between lesion volume estimated on T2-weighted images, ADC maps, and DCE-MR images with pathology were 0.91 (p = 9.03 × 10-16), 0.86 (p = 7.32 × 10-13), and 0.93 (p = 8.22 × 10-18), respectively.

Aim:   To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sexual Function and Satisfaction (SexFS) measures, including items from versions 1 and 2 of the short forms.  Methods:   A population-based cohort of men across North Carolina completed surveys via phone interviews at baseline (prior to treatment) and at 3, 12, and 24 months after cancer treatment initiation. Surveys included the PROMIS SexFS domains of interest in sexual activity, erectile function, orgasm, and satisfaction and the Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices. Analyses included descriptive statistics, assessment of structural validity using confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory, tests for differential item functioning, assessment of convergent validity using correlations, and evaluation of responsiveness of the PROMIS SexFS measures over time. We hypothesized that men undergoing surgery (prostatectomy) would report the poorest sexual function at the 3-month survey.  Results:   Sample size varied by assessment point and ranged from 332‒939 men, consisting of 30% non-white men, and 30% of the sample had a high school degree or less. The items within the PROMIS orgasm domain did not form a unidimensional scale. PROMIS measures of interest in sexual activity, erectile function, and satisfaction were unidimensional and highly correlated with related Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices measures (eg, erectile function, r = 0.84‒0.95). Erectile function in the surgery group declined more at 3 months compared to the no-surgery group (2 points); this difference narrowed at 12 and 24 months after surgery, as the surgery group recovered over time. Results were similar for PROMIS Interest in Sexual Activity and PROMIS Satisfaction scales.  Clinical implications:   The PROMIS SexFS measures may be used to identify effective interventions to treat sexual dysfunction and monitor sexual functioning in men with prostate cancer over time.  Strength & limitations:   This study was limited to men living in North Carolina who could self-report their health-related quality of life in English. However, this study was able to include more men from vulnerable populations by allowing them to self-report over the phone.  Conclusion:   This study provided strong support for use of the PROMIS SexFS (version 2) measures in men with localized prostate cancer to assess sexual interest, erectile function, and satisfaction over time.

However, the significance of energy metabolism for the development of prostate carcinoma is poorly understood. We investigated the expression of OXPHOS complexes in 94 human prostate carcinomas and paired benign tissue using immunohistochemistry. Overall mitochondrial mass was upregulated in carcinomas compared to benign prostate tissue in all Gleason grades. A significant direct correlation between the expression of OXPHOS complexes I, II, and V and the Gleason score was observed. However, 17% of prostate carcinomas and 18% of benign prostate tissues showed isolated or combined deficiency of OXPHOS complexes (one deficiency in 12% of the tumors, combined deficiencies in 5%). Complex I was absent in 9% of the samples, with only parts of the tumor affected. ATP5F1A, a complex V protein, was the most frequently affected subunit, in 10% of tumors and 11% of benign prostate tissues (but not both tissues in any single patient). A possible role of complex V in prostate cancer development is suggested by the significant positive correlation of ATP5F1A levels with earlier-onset prostate cancer (age at diagnosis and at prostatectomy) and free PSA percentage.

U94/rep, encoded by HHV-6, has been identified to play a vital role in viral gene expression and latency. Recent studies have shown its inhibition of angiogenesis and tumorigenesis in endothelial cells and prostate cancer cell line PC3, respectively. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of U94/rep in the development and progression of glioma.  Patients and methods:   A total of 20 glioma tissues with positive HHV-6 infection were used for detection of U94/rep. MTT, soft agar, propidium iodide staining, wound healing, Transwell, and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assays were applied for evaluation of glioma cells' proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, respectively.  Results:   U94/rep transcripts could be detected in 11 out of 20 glioma tissues with positive HHV-6 infection. Furthermore, MTT and soft agar assays revealed that overexpression of U94/rep inhibited glioma cell proliferation and colony formation, which may be attributed to the cell cycle arrest at S phase induced by U94/rep. Further analysis demonstrated that U94/rep inhibited glioma cells' migration and invasion and ex vivo angiogenesis. Reduced expression of proangiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, and type IV collagenases, MMP-2 and MMP-9, was detected in cells overexpressing U94/rep. These decreased factors may undermine glioma cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis.

Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) are among the potential nanocarriers having unique properties for drug delivery. Doxorubicin (DOX), being the most commonly used drug, can be efficiently delivered to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-overexpressing cancer cells using functionalized MSNPs.  Aim:   We report the development of decapeptide-conjugated MSNPs loaded with DOX for the targeted drug delivery in breast and prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   MSNPs were synthesized and subsequently functionalized with an analog of GnRH by using a heterobifunctional polyethylene glycol as a linker. These targeted MSNPs were then characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. An anticancer drug DOX was loaded and then characterized for drug loading. DOX-loaded nanocarriers were then studied for their cellular uptake using confocal microscopy. The cytotoxicity of DOX-loaded targeted MSNPs and DOX-loaded bare MSNPs was studied by performing MTT assay on MCF-7 (breast cancer) and LNCaP (prostate cancer) cells. Further, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, as well as flow cytometry, was performed to confirm the apoptotic mode of cancer cell death.  Results:   MSNPs were conjugated with polyethylene glycol as well as an agonist of GnRH and subsequently loaded with DOX. These targeted and bare MSNPs showed excellent porous structure and loading of DOX. Further, higher uptake of DOX-loaded targeted MSNPs was observed as compared to DOX-loaded bare MSNPs in GnRH-overexpressing breast (MCF-7) and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cells. The targeted MSNPs also showed significantly higher (P<0.001) cytotoxicity than DOX-loaded bare MSNPs at different time points. After 48 hours of treatment, the IC50 value for DOX-loaded targeted MSNPs was found to be 0.44 and 0.43 µM in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, respectively. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and flow cytometry analysis further confirmed the pathway of cell death through apoptosis.

Fusion genes are presumed to form before fusion RNA expression. However, studies have reported the presence of fusion RNAs in individuals who were negative for chromosomal translocations. These observations give rise to ""the cart before the horse"" hypothesis, in which the genesis of a fusion RNA precedes the fusion gene. The fusion RNA then guides the genomic rearrangements that ultimately result in a gene fusion. However, RNA-mediated genomic rearrangements in mammalian cells have never been demonstrated. Here we provide evidence that expression of a chimeric RNA drives formation of a specified gene fusion via genomic rearrangement in mammalian cells. The process is: (i) specified by the sequence of chimeric RNA involved, (ii) facilitated by physiological hormone levels, (iii) permissible regardless of intrachromosomal (TMPRSS2-ERG) or interchromosomal (TMPRSS2-ETV1) fusion, and (iv) can occur in normal cells before malignant transformation.

Recently, the rs61752561 SNP (Asp84Asn substitution) in exon 3 of the kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3) gene encoding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was reported to be strongly associated with PCa risk (P = 2.3 × 10-8). However, the biological contribution of the rs61752561 SNP to PCa risk has not been elucidated.  Methods:   Recombinant PSA protein variants were generated to assess the SNP-mediated biochemical changes by stability and substrate activity assays. PC3 cell-PSA overexpression models were established to evaluate the effect of the SNP on PCa pathogenesis. Genotype-specific correlation of the SNP with total PSA (tPSA) concentrations and free/total (F/T) PSA ratio were determined from serum samples.  Results:   Functional analysis showed that the rs61752561 SNP affects PSA stability and structural conformation and creates an extra glycosylation site. This PSA variant had reduced enzymatic activity and the ability to stimulate proliferation and migration of PCa cells. Interestingly, the minor allele is associated with lower tPSA concentrations and high F/T PSA ratio in serum samples, indicating that the amino acid substitution may affect PSA immunoreactivity to the antibodies used in the clinical immunoassays.  Conclusions:   The rs61752561 SNP appears to have a potential role in PCa pathogenesis by changing the glycosylation, protein stability, and PSA activity and may also affect the clinically measured F/T PSA ratio. Accounting for these effects on tPSA concentration and F/T PSA ratio may help to improve the accuracy of the current PSA test.""","""['Srilakshmi Srinivasan', 'Carson Stephens', 'Emily Wilson', 'Janaththani Panchadsaram', 'Kerry DeVoss', 'Hannu Koistinen', 'Ulf-Håkan Stenman', 'Mark N Brook', 'Ashley M Buckle', 'Robert J Klein', 'Hans Lilja', 'Judith Clements', 'Jyotsna Batra;Practical Consortium']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Chem""","""['Association between genetic polymorphisms in the prostate-specific antigen gene promoter and serum prostate-specific antigen levels.', 'Association of KLK3 (PSA) genetic variants with prostate cancer risk and PSA levels.', 'Human glandular kallikrein as a tool to improve discrimination of poorly differentiated and non-organ-confined prostate cancer compared with prostate-specific antigen.', 'Review on the simultaneous determination of total prostate-specific antigen and free prostate-specific antigen.', 'Association of gene polymorphisms of KLK3 and prostate cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Biochemical activity induced by a germline variation in KLK3 (PSA) associates with cellular function and clinical outcome in prostate cancer.', 'The roles of proteases in prostate cancer.', 'Remodelling of the tumour microenvironment by the kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'KLK3 in the Regulation of Angiogenesis-Tumorigenic or Not?', 'Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine.']"""

Genotypes included 357 SNPs from 83 candidate genes in androgen metabolism, inflammation, circadian rhythm, and other pathways. Univariate case-only analysis was conducted to evaluate whether individual SNPs modified the finasteride effect on the risk of high-grade and low-grade prostate cancer. Case-only classification trees and random forests, which are powerful machine learning methods with resampling-based controls for model complexity, were employed to identify a predictive signature for genotype-specific treatment effects. Accounting for multiple testing, a single SNP in SRD5A1 gene (rs472402) significantly modified the finasteride effect on high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score > 6) in PCPT (family-wise error rate < 0.05). Men carrying GG genotype at this locus had a 55% reduction of the risk in developing high-grade cancer when assigned to finasteride (RR = 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.75). Additional effect-modifying SNPs with moderate statistical significance were identified by case-only trees and random forests. A prediction model built by the case-only random forest method with 28 selected SNPs classified 37% of PCPT men to have reduced risk of high-grade prostate cancer when taking finasteride, while the others have increased risk.

We evaluated the multivariable-adjusted association of hyperglycemia with prostate cancer incidence and mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression; men with diagnosed diabetes were included as a separate exposure category. Among 4,753 men without diagnosed diabetes, 61.5% were classified as having hyperglycemia (high on ≥1 biomarker). HbA1c and glycated albumin together classified 61.9% of 1,736 men with normal fasting glucose as normoglycemic. Compared with men who were normal on all three biomarkers, men who were high on ≥1 biomarker had an increased risk of lethal [HR, 2.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-5.58] and fatal (HR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.26-8.48) disease, but not total prostate cancer incidence (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.81-1.20); associations were similar including fructosamine instead of glycated albumin.

Materials & methods:   Cancer registry data (http://www.ncdirindia.org), (population coverage <10%), was compared with transition in life-expectancy and prevalence on smoking, alcohol and obesity. We fitted linear regression to the natural logarithm of the estimated incidence rates of various cancer registries in India.  Results:   Burden of cancer in India increased from 0.6 million in 1991 to 1.4 million in 2015. Among males, common cancers are lung (12.0%), mouth (11.4%), prostate (7.0%), and tongue (7.0%) and among females, they are breast (21.0%), cervix-uteri (12.1%), ovary (6.9%), and lung (4.9%) in 2012. Increased life-expectancy and population growth as well as increased use of alcohol and increased prevalence of overweight/obesity reflected an increase in all cancers in both genders except a reduction in infection-related cancers such as cervix-uteri and tobacco-related cancers such as pharynx (excludes nasopharynx) and oesophagus.  Interpretation & conclusion:   Transition in demographics and epidemiologic risk factors, reflected an increase in all cancers in both genders except a reduction in a few cancers. The increasing incidence of cancer and its associated factors demands a planned approach to reduce its burden. The burden assessment needs to be strengthened by increasing the population coverage of cancer registries.

Although risk assessment models have contributed to a better stratification of patients with local PCa, a tailored management is still in its infancy. Over the last few decades, microRNAs (miRNAs) have shown promising results as biomarkers in PCa. The aim of this study was to investigate circulating miRNAs after management of local PCa.  Methods:   The relative expression of four miRNAs (miRNA-21, -93, -125b, and miRNA-221) was assessed in plasma from 149 newly diagnosed patients with local or locally advanced PCa. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used for analysis. A baseline sample at time of diagnosis and a follow-up sample after 6 months were assessed. The patients were grouped in an interventional cohort (radical prostatectomy, curative intent radiotherapy, or androgen-deprivation therapy alone) and an observational cohort (watchful waiting or active surveillance).  Results:   In the interventional cohort, levels of both miRNA-93 and miRNA-221 were significantly lower in the follow-up samples compared to baseline z = -2.738, P = 0.006, and z = -4.498, P < 0.001, respectively. The same observation was recorded for miRNA-125b in the observational cohort (z = -2.656, P = 0.008). Both miRNA-125b and miRNA-221 were correlated with risk assessment r = 0.23, P = 0.015, and r = 0.203, P = 0.016 respectively, while miRNA-93 showed tendency to significant correlation with the prostatectomy Gleason score (r = 0.276, P = 0.0576).

PD-L1 expression was analyzed in 73 primary prostate cancers and 7 castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and resulting data from primary prostate cancers were correlated with tumor-associated lymphocytes (TALs), clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcome. PD-L1 was expressed in the tumor cells in only one primary prostate cancer case and none of the CRPC. However, PD-L1 was frequently observed in the nerve branches in the tumor-associated stroma (69 of 73 cases, 94.5%), supported by colocalization with axonal marker PGP9.5. FoxP3-, CD3- and CD8-positive T lymphocytes were observed in 74.6% (47/63), 98.4% (62/63) and 100% (61/61) of the cases, respectively. The density of PD-L1+ tumor-associated nerves (TANs) was inversely correlated with that of CD8+ TALs. Higher density of PD-L1+ TANs was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (p = 0.016). In both univariate and multivariate Cox analysis, the density of PD-L1+ TANs was independently prognostic of BCR.

In this study, we investigated the effects of an SDF-1α/CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100, on cell progression and metastasis potential of human PC cells. Human PC cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, and DU145) were cultured to detect SDF-1α/CXCR4, which showed higher SDF-1α and CXCR4 expression than the normal human prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE-1. AMD3100 was confirmed to be an inhibitor of SDF-1α, and to detect the effect of SDF-1α/CXCR4 inhibition on PC, PC cells were treated with AMD3100 or/and CXCR4 siRNA. The results suggested that inhibition of the SDF-1α/CXCR4 pathway could promote the E-cadherin level but inhibit the levels of invasion and migration of vimentin, N-cadherin and α5β1 integrin. Finally, tumor formation in nude mice was conducted, and the cell experiment results were verfied.

Patients and methods:   In this prospective proof-of-concept study, nine patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy underwent mpMRI and PET/CT imaging before surgery. One had PET imaging using 18 F-fluoromethylcholine, five using 68 Ga-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-HBED-CC (PMSA-11), and three using a trial 68 Ga-labelled THP-PSMA tracer. PET/CT data were co-registered with mpMRI via the CT scan and an in vivo three-dimensional T2-weighted (T2w) MRI, and then co-registered with ground truth histology data using ex vivo MRI of the prostate specimen. Maximum and mean standardised uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean ) were extracted from PET data using tumour annotations from histology, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to compare between tumour- and benign-voxel values. Correlation analysis was performed between mpMRI and PET SUV tumour voxel values using Pearson's correlation coefficient and R2 statistics.  Results:   PET/CT data from all nine patients were successfully registered with mpMRI and histology data. SUVmax and SUVmean ranged from 2.21 to 12.11 and 1.08 to 4.21, respectively. All patients showed the PET SUV values in benign and tumour voxels were from statistically different distributions. Correlation analysis showed no consistent trend between the T2w or apparent diffusion coefficient values and PET SUV. However, parameters from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI including the maximum enhancement, volume transfer constant (Ktrans ), and the initial area under the contrast agent concentration curve for the first 60 s after injection (iAUGC60), showed consistent positive correlations with PET SUV. Furthermore, R2* values from blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MRI showed consistent negative correlations with PET SUV-voxel values.  Conclusion:   We have developed a novel framework for registering and correlating PET/CT data at a voxel-level with mpMRI and histology. Despite registration uncertainties, perfusion and oxygenation parameters from DCE MRI and BOLD imaging showed correlations with PET SUV. Further analysis will be performed on a larger patient cohort to quantify these proof-of-concept findings.

However, radioresistance is a major challenge for the current radiotherapy, accumulating evidences suggest microRNAs (miRNAs), as an important regulator in cellular ionizing radiation (IR) responses, are closely correlated with radiosensitivity in many cancers. Here, we identified microRNA-16-5p(miR-16-5p) is significantly upregulated in CaP LNCaP cells following IR and can enhance radiosensitivity through modulating Cyclin D1/E1-pRb-E2F1 pathway. To identify the expression profile of miRNAs in CaP cells exposed to IR, we performed human miRNA probe hybridization chip analysis and miR-16-5p was found to be significantly overexpressed in all treatment groups that irradiated with different doses of X-rays and heavy ions (12 C6+ ). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-16-5p suppressed cell proliferation, reduced cell viability, and induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, resulting in enhanced radiosensitivity in LNCaP cells. Additionally, miR-16-5p specifically targeted the Cyclin D1/E1-3'-UTR in LNCaP cells and affected the expression of Cyclin D1/E1 in both mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, miR-16-5p enhanced radiosensitivity of CaP cells, the mechanism may be through modulating Cyclin D1/Cyclin E1/pRb/E2F1 pathway to cause cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. These findings provided new insight into the correlation between miR-16-5p, cell cycle arrest, and radiosensitivity in CaP, revealed a previously unrecognized function of miR-16-5p-Cyclin D1/E1-pRb-E2F1 regulation in response to IR and may offer an alternative therapy to improve the efficiency of conventional radiotherapy.""","""['Fang Wang', 'Aihong Mao', 'Jinzhou Tang', 'Qianjing Zhang', 'Junfang Yan', 'Yupei Wang', 'Cuixia Di', 'Lu Gan', 'Chao Sun', 'Hong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['miR-449a enhances radiosensitivity through modulating pRb/E2F1 in prostate cancer cells.', 'miR-218 suppresses gastric cancer cell cycle progression through the CDK6/Cyclin D1/E2F1 axis in a feedback loop.', 'MiR-93 suppresses tumorigenesis and enhances chemosensitivity of breast cancer via dual targeting E2F1 and CCND1.', 'Targeting MicroRNAs in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'MicroRNAs in Prostate Cancer Following Radiotherapy: Towards Predicting Response to Radiation Treatment.', 'Plasmatic MicroRNAs and Treatment Outcomes of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Hospital-Based Cohort Study and In Silico Analysis.', 'Does particle radiation have superior radiobiological advantages for prostate cancer cells?

This paper presents 5-yr EPID in vivo dosimetry (IVD) data obtained using the Dosimetry Check (DC) software on a large cohort including breast, lung, prostate, and head and neck (H&N) cancer patients.  Material and methods:   The difference between in vivo dose measurements obtained by DC and point doses calculated by the Eclipse treatment planning system was obtained on 3795 radiotherapy patients treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) (n = 842) and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) (n = 2953) at 6, 10, and 15 MV. In cases where the dose difference exceeded ±10% further inspection and additional phantom measurements were performed.  Results:   The mean and standard deviation ( μ ± σ ) of the percentage difference in dose obtained by DC and calculated by Eclipse in VMAT was: 0.19 ± 3.89 % in brain, 1.54 ± 4.87 % in H&N, and 1.23 ± 4.61 % in prostate cancer. In 3DCRT, this was 1.79 ± 3.51 % in brain, - 2.95 ± 5.67 % in breast, - 1.43 ± 4.38 % in bladder, 1.66 ± 4.77 % in H&N, 2.60 ± 5.35% in lung and - 3.62 ± 4.00 % in prostate cancer. A total of 153 plans exceeded the ±10% alert criteria, which included: 88 breast plans accounting for 7.9% of all breast treatments; 28 H&N plans accounting for 4.4% of all H&N treatments; and 12 prostate plans accounting for 3.5% of all prostate treatments. All deviations were found to be as a result of patient-related anatomical deviations and not from procedural errors.  Conclusions:   This preliminary data shows that EPID-based IVD with DC may not only be useful in detecting errors but has the potential to be used to establish site-specific dose action levels.

Materials and methods:   The study included 108 patients newly diagnosed with high-volume metastatic CSPC. Enumeration and characterization of patients' baseline CTCs (CTCs+ and CTCs-, indicating detectable and undetectable CTCs, respectively) were performed using the CanPatrol technique, which detects markers of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CTCs, and classifies CTCs into epithelial, biophenotypic and mesenchymal phenotypes.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 24 months, 90 patients (83.3%) progressed to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), 93 patients (86.1%) had detectable CTCs, and the median number of CTCs was 4. The rate of progression to CRPC was significantly higher for patients with mesenchymal CTCs+ than for patients with CTCs+/mesenchymal CTCs- and CTCs- (93.1% vs 71.4% and 73.3%; P = 0.013). The median time to CRPC for patients with mesenchymal CTCs+ was significantly shorter than for those with CTCs+/mesenchymal CTCs- and CTCs- (10.5 months vs 18.0 and 14.0 months; P = 0.003). Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the CTC phenotype was the only independent prognostic factor influencing the progression of disease from CSPC to CRPC.

Similar changes are seen in prostate cancer patients and they are related to outcome. One gene previously found to be upregulated in the non-malignant part of tumor-bearing prostate lobe in rats was the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ).  Methods:   To explore this further, we examined C/EBPβ expression by quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot in normal rat prostate tissue surrounding slow-growing non-metastatic Dunning G, rapidly growing poorly metastatic (AT-1), and rapidly growing highly metastatic (MatLyLu) rat prostate tumors-and also by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray (TMA) from prostate cancer patients managed by watchful waiting.  Results:   In rats, C/EBPβ mRNA expression was upregulated in the surrounding tumor-bearing prostate lobe. In tumors and in the surrounding non-malignant prostate tissue, C/EBPβ was detected by immunohistochemistry in some epithelial cells and in infiltrating macrophages. The magnitude of glandular epithelial C/EBPβ expression in the tumor-bearing prostates was associated with tumor size, distance to the tumor, and metastatic capacity. In prostate cancer patients, high expression of C/EBPβ in glandular epithelial cells in the surrounding tumor-bearing tissue was associated with accumulation of M1 macrophages (iNOS+) and favorable outcome. High expression of C/EBPβ in tumor epithelial cells was associated with high Gleason score, high tumor cell proliferation, metastases, and poor outcome.

Materials and methods:   RT-qPCR was performed to measure the expression levels of miR-144-3p in CRPC tissues. CRPC cells were transfected with miR-144-3p or NC. MTT and colony formation assays were used to determine cell growth; flow cytometry was used to measure apoptosis; a luciferase reporter assay was used to predict the target genes regulated by miR-144-3p. Finally, siCEP55 or siNC was transfected into DU145 cells, and the rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured. Protein expression levels were confirmed by Western blot analysis.  Results:   MiR-144-3p expression was significantly decreased in both CRPC tissues and cell lines compared with that from androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) tumors. Overexpression of miR-144-3p in CRPC cells effectively inhibited proliferation and colony formation and promoted apoptosis in these CRPC cells. Additionally, miR-144-3p directly targeted centrosomal protein 55 (CEP55) and suppressed CEP55 expression. Finally, CEP55 silencing remarkably suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of CRPC cells, indicating that miR-144-3p affects CRPC cell survival and proliferation by downregulating CEP55.

Materials and methods:   Data were obtained from the multi-institutional Spanish RECAP database, a population-based prostate cancer registry in Spain. All IR patients (NCCN criteria) who underwent primary EBRT were included. The following variables were assessed: age; prostate-specific antigen (PSA); Gleason score; clinical T stage; percentage of positive biopsy cores (PPBC); androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); and radiotherapy dose. The patients were stratified into one of three risk subcategories: (1) favourable IR (FIR; GS 6, ≤ T2b or GS 3 + 4, ≤ T1c), (2) marginal IR (MIR; GS 3 + 4, T2a-b), and (3) unfavourable IR (UIR; GS 4 + 3 or T2c). Biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS), disease-free survival (DFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed.  Results:   A total of 1754 patients from the RECAP database were included and stratified by risk group: FIR, n = 781 (44.5%); MIR, n = 252 (14.4%); and UIR, n = 721 (41.1%). Mean age was 71 years (range 47-86). Mean PSA was 10.4 ng/ml (range 6-20). The median radiotherapy dose was 74 Gy, with mean doses of 72.5 Gy (FIR), 73.4 Gy (MIR), and 72.8 Gy (UIR). Most patients (88%) received ADT for a median of 7.1 months. By risk group (FIR, MIR, UIR), ADT rates were, respectively, 88.9, 86.5, and 86.9%. Only patients with ≥ 24 months of follow-up post-EBRT were included in the survival analysis (n = 1294). At a median follow-up of 52 months (range 24-173), respective 5- and 10-year outcomes were: OS 93.6% and 79%; BRFS 88.9% and 71.4%; DFS 96.1% and 89%; CSS 98.9% and 94.6%. Complication rates (≥ grade 3) were: acute genitourinary (GU) 2%; late GU 1%; acute gastrointestinal (GI) 2%; late GI 1%. There was no significant association between risk group and BRFS or OS. However, patients with favourable-risk disease had significantly better 5- and 10-year DFS than patients with UIR: 98.7% vs. 92.4% and 92% vs. 85.8% (p = 0.0005). CSS was significantly higher (p = 0.0057) in the FIR group at 5 (99.7% vs. 97.3%) and 10 years (96.1% vs. 93.4%). On the multivariate analyses, the following were significant predictors of survival: ADT (BRFS and DFS); dose ≥ 74 Gy (BRFS); age (OS).  Conclusions:   This is the first nationwide study in Spain to report long-term outcomes of patients with intermediate-risk PCa treated with EBRT. Survival outcomes were good, with a low incidence of both acute and late toxicity. Patients with unfavourable risk characteristics had significantly lower 5- and 10-year disease-free survival rates.

Total withanolide concentration differed by ~ 17-fold between sites, ranging from 1.01 ± 0.01 mg/g dry weight (mean ± SE) at Jand to 16.83 ± 0.02 mg/g at Mohmand Agency. Different tissues varied in their total withanolide content with roots having the least (0.42 ± 0.07 mg/g dry weight) and leaves the most (2.45 ± 0.45 mg/g).

This study was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetic profile between the test product (abiraterone acetate tablet) and reference product ZYTIGA® (250 mg) mainly.  Methods:   To overcome the high intra-subject variability of abiraterone, a two-sequence and four-period crossover study was designed to assess bioequivalence between the two products in 32 healthy male Chinese subjects under fasting conditions. The plasma concentration of abiraterone was analyzed by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay and the reference-scaled procedure was used to determine bioequivalence for the pharmacokinetics parameters.  Results:   The point estimate of geometric mean ratios with 90% confidence interval (CI) of maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0t) for abiraterone in the test and reference products were 100.19% (90% CI 87.05-115.32%) and 105.99% (90% CI 96.34-116.62%), respectively, and were both within the range of 80.00-125.00%.

However, the inception of transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) technology revolutionized the simultaneous measurement of the transcript abundance levels for thousands of genes.  Objective:   In this paper, such next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is used to identify biomarker signatures for several of the most common cancer types (bladder, colon, kidney, brain, liver, lung, prostate, skin, and thyroid) METHODS: Here, the problem is mapped into the comparison of optimization algorithms for selecting a set of genes that lead to the highest classification accuracy of a two-class classification task between healthy and tumor samples. As the optimization algorithms Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Ant Colony Optimization, Differential Evolution, and Particle Swarm Optimization are chosen for this experiment. A standard statistical method called DESeq2 is used to select differentially expressed genes before being feed to the optimization algorithms. Classification of healthy and tumor samples is done by support vector machine RESULTS: Cancer-specific validation yields remarkably good results in terms of accuracy. Highest classification accuracy is achieved by the ABC algorithm for Brain lower grade glioma data is 99.10%. This validation is well supported by a statistical test, gene ontology enrichment analysis, and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for each cancer biomarker signature CONCLUSION: The current study identified robust genes as biomarker signatures and these identified biomarkers might be helpful to accurately identify tumors of unknown origin.""","""['Shib Sankar Bhowmick', 'Debotosh Bhattacharjee', 'Luis Rato']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Genes Genomics""","""['RNA-Seq accurately identifies cancer biomarker signatures to distinguish tissue of origin.', 'Identification of genes and pathways involved in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma.', 'Genetic Bee Colony (GBC) algorithm: A new gene selection method for microarray cancer classification.', 'GSNFS: Gene subnetwork biomarker identification of lung cancer expression data.', 'Identification and Clinical Translation of Biomarker Signatures: Statistical Considerations.', 'A Novel XGBoost Method to Identify Cancer Tissue-of-Origin Based on Copy Number Variations.', 'A Neural Network Framework for Predicting the Tissue-of-Origin of 15 Common Cancer Types Based on RNA-Seq Data.', 'In silico markers: an evolutionary and statistical approach to select informative genes of human breast cancer subtypes.']"""

The overall and stratified DR for PSA ranges and prostate volume (PV), operative time and complications were compared.  Results:   The overall detection rate was very high in both groups (FT 58.2% vs FH 59.6%) and not statistically different between the two techniques. There were no differences in terms of complication rates and pain. The FH showed a better detection rate in prostates smaller than 40 cc (p = 0.023) and a faster operative time (p = 0.025) compared to FT.

The aim of this study was to assess the visibility of MRI lesions on B TRUS and to determine which factors may influence the visibility on B TRUS.  Material and methods:   142 men with 148 lesions reported on mpMRI underwent a B TRUS/mpMRI fusion targeted biopsy of the prostate and were included in this retrospective study. During the biopsy, images were obtained and stored in the institution's PACS. These images were reviewed by two radiologists to determine, whether an mpMRI lesion was or was not visible on B TRUS.  Results:   Overall 92 from 148 mpMRI lesions (62.2%) were visible on B TRUS. The location of the lesion in the prostate, the PIRADS classification of the lesions and the size of the lesion had no significant influence on the visibility on B TRUS. Only the prostate volume had a significant influence on visibility: in smaller prostates significantly more lesions were visible on B TRUS than in large glands (p+0.041; 45.1 ml vs 54 ml).

SRC-1 has been shown to play an important role in the progression of breast cancer and prostate cancer. However, its role in glioma progression remains unknown. Here, in this study, we report that SRC-1 is upregulated in the vessels of human glioma and exerts important regulatory functions. Specifically, SRC-1 expression significantly enhanced basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-mediated angiogenesis in vivo. Downregulating of SRC-1 expression suppressed endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro and upregulated the expression of pro-angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-9 in glioma cells. These SRC-1-mediated effects were dependent on the activation of polyomavirus enhancer activator 3 (PEA3) transcriptional activity. VEGF and VEGF inducer GS4012 induced the direct binding of SRC-1 and PEA3 in glioma cells, and PEA3 could directly bind with VEGF and MMP-9 promoter under GS4012 treatment in glioma cell. The expression of pro-angiogenic factors induced by SRC-1 was abrogated by sh-PEA3 knockdown. Taken together, these novel outcomes indicated that SRC-1 modulated endothelial cell (EC) function and facilitated a pro-angiogenic microenvironment through PEA3 signaling. Moreover, a combination of targeting SRC-1 and PEA3 signaling in glioma could be a promising strategy for suppressing tumor angiogenesis.""","""['Yi Zhang', 'Wei Shi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biochem Cell Biol""","""['ADAM12 Is a Novel Regulator of Tumor Angiogenesis via STAT3 Signaling.', 'Steroid receptor coactivator-2 (SRC-2) coordinates cardiomyocyte paracrine signaling to promote pressure overload-induced angiogenesis.', 'Salinomycin exhibits anti-angiogenic activity against human glioma in vitro and in vivo by suppressing the VEGF-VEGFR2-AKT/FAK signaling axis.', 'MiR-383 inhibits proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of glioma-exposed endothelial cells in vitro via VEGF-mediated FAK and Src signaling pathways.', 'The function of steroid receptor coactivator-1 in normal tissues and cancer.', 'Emerging roles of steroid receptor coactivators in stromal cell responses.']"""

In our cohort analysis, the PET/MRI parameters UVP/minimal ADC value (ADCmin) and kurtosis of Kep (Kepkur)/ADCmin were significant predictors for progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02, p=0.031 and HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.16, p=0.009, respectively) in multivariate Cox regression analysis. High UVP/ADCmin and Kepkur/ADCmin values were significantly associated with shorter PFS.  Conclusions:   Metabolic volumetric parameters such as MTV and UVP can be routinely used as PET imaging biomarkers to add prognostic value and show better correlations in combination with MR imaging parameters in high-risk prostate cancer patients undergoing 11C-choline PET/MRI.""","""['Jing-Ren Tseng', 'Lan-Yan Yang', 'Yu-Chun Lin', 'Chung-Yi Liu', 'See-Tong Pang', 'Ji-Hong Hong', 'Tzu-Chen Yen', 'Li-Jen Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Contrast Media Mol Imaging""","""['Usefulness of MRI-assisted metabolic volumetric parameters provided by simultaneous (18)F-fluorocholine PET/MRI for primary prostate cancer characterization.', 'Is there an additional value of ¹¹C-choline PET-CT to T2-weighted MRI images in the localization of intraprostatic tumor nodules?', 'Comparison of (11)Ccholine Positron Emission Tomography With T2- and Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Delineating Malignant Intraprostatic Lesions.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET: added value and future applications in comparison to the current use of choline-PET and mpMRI in the workup of prostate cancer.', 'Novel Imaging of Prostate Cancer with MRI, MRI/US, and PET.', 'The Role of 18FF-Choline PET/CT in the Initial Management and Outcome Prediction of Prostate Cancer: A Real-World Experience from a Multidisciplinary Approach.', 'MRI/PET Imaging in elevated PSA and localized prostate cancer: a narrative review.', 'PET/MRI in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prognostic Value of Pretreatment MRI in Patients With Prostate Cancer Treated With Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Method:   Overall mortality figures were taken from the number of deaths for each type of cancer based on ICD-10. The number of years lost were obtained according to life expectancy in Mexico (72 years for men and 77 years for women).  Results:   Prostate cancer mortality is higher than that of breast cancer, but lost years in women due to breast cancer are higher. The cost of programs for breast and prostate cancer from 2013 to 2016 in both institutions was 3 036 322 156 Mexican Pesos.

These screens uncovered a comprehensive genome-wide profile of ATR inhibitor sensitivity. From the candidate genes, we demonstrated that RNASEH2 deficiency is synthetic lethal with ATR inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. RNASEH2-deficient cells exhibited elevated levels of DNA damage and, when treated with AZD6738, underwent apoptosis (short-time treated) or senescence (long-time treated).

After PC cells were transfected with siRNA or a recombinant vector in the absence or presence of a β-catenin signaling inhibitor (XAV-939), the expression levels of FAM46B, C-myc, Cyclin D1, and β-catenin were measured by western blot and real-time PCR.

Our results showed that FAM46B was downregulated but that β-catenin was upregulated in patients with PC. FAM46B silencing promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in PC, which were abrogated by XAV-939. Moreover, FAM46B overexpression inhibited PC cell cycle progression and cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.

In prostate cancer (PCa), however, it has not been investigated whether and how p53 regulates EMT by circRNAs and miRNAs. Here we show that a Amotl1-derived circRNA, termed circAMOTL1L, is downregulated in human PCa, and that decreased circAMOTL1L facilitates PCa cell migration and invasion through downregulating E-cadherin and upregulating vimentin, thus leading to EMT and PCa progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that circAMOTL1L serves as a sponge for binding miR-193a-5p in PCa cells, relieving miR-193a-5p repression of Pcdha gene cluster (a subset of the cadherin superfamily members). Accordingly, dysregulation of the circAMOTL1L-miR-193a-5p-Pcdha8 regulatory pathway mediated by circAMOTL1L downregulation contributes to PCa growth in vivo. Further, we show that RBM25 binds directly to circAMOTL1L and induces its biogenesis, whereas p53 regulates EMT via direct activation of RBM25 gene.

This paper presents an alternative approach to achieve the extraction of E. coli bacteria from blood samples spiked with prostate cancer cells. Our approach consists in cascading individual DLD devices in a single automated platform, using flexible chambers that successively collect and inject the sample between each DLD stage without any external sample manipulation. Operating DLD separations independently enables to maximize the sorting efficiency at each step, without any disturbance from downstream stages. The proposed two-step automated protocol is applied to the separation of three types of components (bacteria, blood particles and cancer cells), with a depletion yield of 100% for cancer cells and 93% for red blood cells. This cascaded approach is presented for the first time with two DLD modules and is upscalable to improve the dynamic range of currently available DLD devices.""","""['Eloise Pariset', 'Charlotte Parent', 'Yves Fouillet', 'Boizot François', 'Nicolas Verplanck', 'Frédéric Revol-Cavalier', 'Aurélie Thuaire', 'Vincent Agache']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['A Review on Deterministic Lateral Displacement for Particle Separation and Detection.', 'Asymmetrical Deterministic Lateral Displacement Gaps for Dual Functions of Enhanced Separation and Throughput of Red Blood Cells.', 'Purification of complex samples: Implementation of a modular and reconfigurable droplet-based microfluidic platform with cascaded deterministic lateral displacement separation modules.', 'Numerical simulation of critical particle size in asymmetrical deterministic lateral displacement.', 'Deterministic lateral displacement for particle separation: a review.', 'Geometric structure design of passive label-free microfluidic systems for biological micro-object separation.', 'Progress of Microfluidic Continuous Separation Techniques for Micro-/Nanoscale Bioparticles.', 'A Review on Deterministic Lateral Displacement for Particle Separation and Detection.', 'Sequential Cell-Processing System by Integrating Hydrodynamic Purification and Dielectrophoretic Trapping for Analyses of Suspended Cancer Cells.']"""

Nevertheless, its mechanism of action is not yet clear. Consequently, this study aimed to elucidate its influence and explore the etiology of PCCs (prostate cancer cells). MATERIAL AND METHODS The proliferation of prostate cancer cells was determined by CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was determined by Hoechst staining FC assay. Cell migration was detected by scratch test. The levels of apoptosis-related protein were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS It was discovered that resveratrol suppresses cellular survival and migration and enhances cell death. In addition, it was revealed that resveratrol elevated ROS concentration and expression of biomarker of cell death Bax, while inhibiting Bcl2, an anti-apoptotic protein, and reinforcing expression of p53. Moreover, resveratrol remarkably increased the expressions of HIF-1α and p53 in PC cells. Resveratrol suppressed cell survival and promoted cell death, but its effects were reversed after HIF-1α knockdown, suggesting that the effects of resveratrol in PC are mediated via HIF-1α.

Diagnostic biopsies (n=1080) and transurethral resection of prostate specimens (n=314) from 1394 men with clinically localized prostate cancer diagnosed in the United Kingdom but treated conservatively between 1990 and 2003 were reviewed by a panel of 3 genitourinary pathologists. Thirty-five cases were excluded for being potentially incomplete. Of the remaining 1359, 30 (2.2%) were reassigned to a nonmalignant category (26 benign and 4 suspicious for malignancy). IHC had been originally performed on 7 of these. The reasons for the errors were recorded on each case: adenosis (19), partial atrophy (3), prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (2), seminal vesicle epithelium (1), and hyperplasia (1). Follow-up of these men revealed only one prostate cancer-related death, possibly due to unsampled tumor. In conclusion, a relatively small number of prostate cancer mimics were responsible for a large proportion of the false-positive prostate cancer diagnoses and the use of IHC did not prevent the overcall of benign entities as cancer in approximately a quarter of these cases. Targeting these mimics at educational events and raising awareness of the pitfalls in the interpretation of IHC in prostate cancer diagnosis, emphasizing that glands within a suspicious focus should be treated as a whole rather than individually, may be beneficial in lowering the rate of false-positive diagnosis.""","""['Luis Beltran', 'Amar S Ahmad', 'Holly Sandu', 'Sakunthala Kudahetti', 'Geraldine Soosay', 'Henrik Møller', 'Jack Cuzick', 'Daniel M Berney;Transatlantic Prostate Group']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['The diagnostic utility of novel immunohistochemical marker ERG in the workup of prostate biopsies with ""atypical glands suspicious for cancer"".', 'Pitfalls in the diagnosis of prostatic cancer: retrospective review of 1791 cases with clinical outcome.', 'The utility of basal cell-specific anti-cytokeratin antibody (34 beta E12) in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Studies, mostly among highly screened, predominantly European ancestral populations, suggest that employment in certain occupations (eg, farming, military) may also have an increased risk for PCa. Here, we evaluated the association between usual adult occupation and PCa risk in Ghanaian men, a population with historically low rates of PCa screening.  Methods:   The Ghana Prostate Study is a case-control study of PCa that was conducted from 2004 to 2012 in 749 cases and 964 controls. In-person interviews were conducted to collect information from participants, including longest held job. Industrial hygienists classified job titles into occupational categories. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate ORs and 95% CIs for the association between longest held job and PCa risk (overall, aggressive (Gleason≥7)), controlling for potential confounders.  Results:   Risk was increased among men in management (overall PCa OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.2; aggressive PCa OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.5) and military occupations (overall PCa OR=3.4, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.0; aggressive PCa OR=3.5, 95% CI 1.5 to 8.3).

In the ALSYMPCA study, radium-223 (Ra223) was found to provide pain palliation in addition to prolonged survival and reduced skeletal-related events (SREs). Given previous evidence that bisphosphonates impacted pain relief from the radiopharmaceutical samarium-153, we evaluated whether the timing of bone supportive therapy (BST) such as zoledronic acid or denosumab affected pain palliation from Ra223.  Methods:   We identified patients who received Ra223 at University of Southern California or Mayo Clinic Arizona. Patients were evaluable for pain response if they had baseline pain score > 0 and at least 1 pain score documented after Ra223 with pain medication use data. Patients were evaluable for pain flare if they had known baseline pain score and at least 2 pain scores documented after Ra223. Pain response was defined as > 2 point decrease in pain on a 10-point scale; flare was defined as > 2 point increase followed by return to baseline or lower.  Results:   Of 65 patients, 22 (34%) received BST. Median number of doses Ra223 was 5 (range 2-6). Fourteen patients were evaluable for pain response and 34 for pain flare. Eighteen patients received concurrent abiraterone (abi) or enzalutamide (enza), and 16 did not. Pain response occurred in 6/6 (100%) patients who received BST within 1 month prior to first Ra223 dose and 4/8 (50%) patients who did not receive BST. Pain flare occurred in 6/21 patients (29%) without BST and 2/13 (15%) with BST (p = 0.44). 6/10 (60%) patients with pain response had a decline in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level, but there was no consistent pattern of ALP changes in patients with flare. 8/8 patients with pain response had no PSA decline. 6/8 (75%) and 2/18 (11%) patients on abi/enza had pain response and flare respectively, and 4/6 (67%) and 6/16 (38%) patients without concurrent abi/enza had response/flare.

Aim of the study:   This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect against BPH of the ethyl acetate extracts (EAE) and n-butanol extracts (BUE) from E. angustifolium and to chemical investigation of the active constituents.  Materials and methods:   The in vitro anti-BPH activity was assessed by determining the benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelial-1 (BPH-1) cell viability using MTT assay as well as suppressing of prostate specific antigen (PSA) secretion in prostate epithelial cancer hormone-dependent (LNCaP) cells measured by ELISA method. The in vivo anti-BPH was evaluated by testosterone propionate induced BPH SD rats. After oral administration of BUE at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg B.W. for 28 days, the prostate weight and index, plasma androgen level, histopathological alteration, oxidative and inflammatory-related factors in prostate were assessed. Phytochemical investigation on active extracts was carried by chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. Anti-BPH activities of the isolates were evaluated in vitro.  Results:   BUE and EAE from E. angustifolium exhibited significant anti-BPH effect in vitro. Further in vivo study demonstrated that BUE exhibited therapeutic effects against TP-induced BPH in SD rats via down-regulating of the androgen level, suppressing the expression of NF-κB and eventually alleviating the inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. Phytochemical research on BUE and EAE extracts led to the isolation and identification of 50 compounds. In vitro anti-BPH screening revealed that 26 compounds exhibited anti-proliferation in BHP-1 cell and 36 compounds showed PSA inhibition in LNCap cell, in which 7 compounds exhibited very significant anti-BPH activities in both two cell lines (P < 0.01), 5 compounds with extremely significant activities in one of the cell lines (P < 0.001), and compound 25 exhibited the most potent anti-BPH activity (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   E. angustifolium exhibited the therapeutic potential against BPH, and its active compounds may be used as candidate for treatment of BPH.""","""['Liqing Deng', 'Wei Zong', 'Xueying Tao', 'Shuang Liu', 'Zhiying Feng', 'Yuping Lin', 'Zhihua Liao', 'Min Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Ethnopharmacol""","""['Evaluation of the Effect of Epilobium angustifolium Aqueous Extract on LNCaP Cell Proliferation in In Vitro and In Vivo Models.', 'Epilobium angustifolium L. extract with high content in oenothein B on benign prostatic hyperplasia: A monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.', 'Paljung-San, a traditional herbal medicine, attenuates benign prostatic hyperplasia in vitro and in vivo.', 'Phytochemistry, pharmacology and traditional uses of different Epilobium species (Onagraceae): a review.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Polyphenols from Epilobium Angustifolium (Fireweed).', 'Role of Phytotherapy in the Management of BPH: A Summary of the Literature.', 'Biological Activity of an Epilobium angustifolium L.

Progression to castrate resistant prostate cancer (CaP) includes de-regulation of androgen synthesis suggesting a role for statins in this setting. Our goal was to assess the role of statin use on oncologic outcomes in patients with advanced CaP being treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods:   The national VA database was used to identify all men diagnosed with CaP who were treated with ADT for at least 6 months between 2000 and 2008 with follow-up through May 2016. Our cohort was stratified based on statin use of at least 6 months duration during the same time. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses with inverse propensity score weighted (IPSW) adjustment were calculated to assess for primary outcomes of CaP-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS) and skeletal related events (SREs).  Results:   A total of 87,346 patients on ADT were included in the study cohort, 53,360 patients used statins and 33,986 did not. Statin users were younger in age (median 73 vs. 76, P < 0.001), more likely to have a higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) >3 (3.1% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.001) and more likely to have a high grade (Gleason score 8-10) cancer (12.3% vs. 10.9%, P < 0.001). Statin users had longer OS (median 6.5 vs. 4.0 years P < 0.001) and decreased death from CaP (5-year CSS 94.0% vs. 87.3%, P < 0.001). Statin use was also associated with longer time to a SRE (median 5.9 vs. 3.7 years, P < 0.001). On multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis with inverse propensity score weighted, statin use was an independent predictor of improved OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.68; P < 0.001), CSS (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.53-0.60; P < 0.001), and SREs (HR 0.64, 95%CI 0.59-0.71; P < 0.001) when controlling for age, race, Charlson comorbidity index, prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score.  Conclusion:   The use of statins in men on ADT for CaP is associated with improved CSS and OS.

Material and methods:   Between January 2008 and December 2017, data of 1294 patients diagnosed with chronic prostatitis, in a single urology clinic, meeting a number of selective inclusion/exclusion criteria, were retrospectively analyzed. Patients, compliant to fill out all requested questionnaires, between the ages of 21-65 years were included to the study. Exclusion criteria were noncompliance of filling out required questionnaires, acute and/or chronic bacterial prostatitis, history of genitourinary cancer, history of recent prostate surgery, and diagnosis of neurological diseases affecting the bladder.  Results:   The median patient age and UPOINT subdomain was determined as 37 (IQR = 13, range 21-65) and 2 (IQR = 1, range 0-5), respectively.

Updating these tools using more specific outcome measures and contemporary predictors could potentially lead to further reductions. Our objective was to assess clinical impact of the 4 kallikrein (4K) score, the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (RPCRC), and the combination of both for predicting csCaP based on the latest International Society of Urological Pathology grading system and cribriform growth pattern.  Materials and methods:   Our prospective cohort consisted of 2,872 men from the first screening round in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Rotterdam; biopsy indication PSA ≥ 3.0. The predictive performance of the 4Kscore, RPCRC, and the combination of RPCRC with 4Kscore were assessed with area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots. Decision curve analysis was used to evaluate the reduction of unnecessary biopsy and indolent CaP.  Results:   The csCaP was present in 242 (8%) men, and indolent CaP in 578 (20%). The 4Kscore and RPCRC had similar high AUCs (0.88 vs. 0.87; P = 0.41). The 4Kscore-RPCRC combination improved AUC to 0.89 compared to 4Kscore (P < 0.01) and RPCRC (P < 0.01). The RPCRC and 4Kscore reduced the number of Bx with 42 and 44, respectively, per 100 men at risk compared to a ≥PSA 3.0 strategy without increasing missed csCaP. The RPCRC-4Kscore combination resulted in a slight additional net reduction of 3.3 biopsies per 100 men.  Conclusions:   The RPCRC and 4Kscore had similar reductions of unnecessary biopsies and overdiagnosis of indolent disease. Combination of both models slightly reduced unnecessary biopsies further.

Methods and materials:   In this phase 2 noncomparative multicenter trial, 124 patients with locally advanced, high-risk prostate cancer were randomized between prostate-only IMRT (PO) (74 Gy/37 fractions) and prostate and pelvic lymph node IMRT (P&P; 74 Gy/37 fractions to prostate, 60 Gy/37 fractions to pelvis). The primary endpoint was acute lower gastrointestinal (GI) Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) toxicity at week 18, aiming to exclude a grade 2 or greater (G2+) toxicity-free rate of 80% in the P&P group. Key secondary endpoints included patient-reported outcomes and late toxicity.  Results:   One hundred twenty-four participants were randomized (62 PO, 62 P&P) from May 2011 to March 2013. Median follow-up was 37.6 months (interquartile range [IQR], 35.4-38.9 months). Participants had a median age of 69 years (IQR, 64-74 years) and median diagnostic prostate-specific androgen level of 21.6 ng/mL (IQR, 11.8-35.1 ng/mL). At week 18, G2+ lower GI toxicity-free rates were 59 of 61 (96.7%; 90% confidence interval [CI], 90.0-99.4) for the PO group and 59 of 62 (95.2%; 90% CI, 88.0-98.7) for the P&P group.

The largest difference occurred at week 6 with 4 of 61 (7%) and 16 of 61 (26%) PO and P&P patients, respectively, experiencing G2+ toxicity. At 2 years, the cumulative proportion of RTOG G2+ GI toxicity was 16.9% (95% CI, 8.9%-30.9%) for the PO group and 24.0% (95% CI, 8.4%-57.9%) for the P&P group; in addition, RTOG G2+ bladder toxicity was 5.1% (95% CI, 1.7%-14.9%) for the PO group and 5.6% (95% CI, 1.8%-16.7%) for the P&P group.

Some accelerated partial breast irradiation techniques lead to skin toxicity with the skin dose as a main risk factor. Biodegradable spacers are effective and safe in prostate brachytherapy to protect the rectum. We hypothesize that a subcutaneous spacer injection reduces the skin dose in breast brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   Ultrasound-guided spacer injections, either hyaluronic acid (HA) or iodined polyethylene glycol (PEG), were performed on fresh mastectomy specimens. Success was defined as a spacer thickness of ≥5 mm in the high-dose skin area. Usability was scored using the system usability scale. Pre and postinjection CT scans were used to generate low-dose-rate seed brachytherapy treatment plans after defining a clinical target volume. Maximum dose to small skin volumes (D0.2cc) and existence of hotspots (isodose ≥90% on 1 cm2 of skin) were calculated as skin toxicity indicators.  Results:   We collected 22 mastectomy specimens; half had HA and half had PEG injection. Intervention success was 100% for HA and 90.9% for PEG (p = NS). Hydrodissection was feasible in 81.8% with HA and 63.6% with PEG. Median system usability scale score was 97.5 for HA and 82.5 for PEG (p < 0.001). Mean D0.2cc was 80.8 Gy without spacer and 53.7 Gy with spacer (p < 0.001). Skin hotspots were present in 40.9% without spacer but none with spacer (p < 0.001).

Recent studies have shown that zinc and p53 not only induce tumor cell apoptosis, but also regulate tumor cell metabolism. However, the underlying mechanism is complex and remains unclear, making further research imperative to provide clues for future cancer treatments. In this study, we found that hexokinase 2 (HK2), which has dual metabolic and apoptotic functions, is downstream of zinc and p53 in both prostate cancer patient tissue and prostate cancer cell lines. Notably, the mitochondrial location of HK2 is crucial for its function. We demonstrate that zinc and p53 disrupt mitochondrial binding of HK2 in prostate cancer cells by phosphorylating VDAC1, which is mediated by protein kinase B (Akt) inhibition and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activation. In addition, we found that zinc combined with p53 significantly inhibited tumor growth in a prostate cancer cell xenograft model.

Objective:   To compare pain palliation as the primary endpoint for cabozantinib versus mitoxantrone-prednisone in men with mCRPC and symptomatic bone metastases using patient-reported outcome measures.  Design, setting, and participants:   A randomized, double-blind phase 3 trial (COMET-2; NCT01522443) in men with mCRPC and narcotic-dependent pain from bone metastases who had progressed after treatment with docetaxel and either abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Intervention:   Cabozantinib 60mg once daily orally versus mitoxantrone 12mg/m2 every 3wk plus prednisone 5mg twice daily orally.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was pain response at week 6 confirmed at week 12 (≥30% decrease from baseline in patient-reported average daily worst pain score via the Brief Pain Inventory without increased narcotic use). The planned sample size was 246 to achieve ≥90% power.  Results and limitations:   Enrollment was terminated early because cabozantinib did not demonstrate a survival benefit in the companion COMET-1 trial. At study closure, 119 participants were randomized (cabozantinib: N=61; mitoxantrone-prednisone: N=58). Complete pain and narcotic use data were available at baseline, week 6, and week 12 for 73/106 (69%) patients. There was no significant difference in the pain response with cabozantinib versus mitoxantrone-prednisone: the proportions of responders were 15% versus 17%, a -2% difference (95% confidence interval: -16% to 11%, p=0.8). Barriers to accrual included pretreatment requirements for a washout period of prior anticancer therapy and a narcotic optimization period to maximize analgesic dosing.

Objective:   To compare the incidence of PCa between men with and those without IBD.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a retrospective, matched-cohort study involving a single academic medical center and conducted from 1996 to 2017. Male patients with IBD (cases=1033) were randomly matched 1:9 by age and race to men without IBD (controls=9306). All patients had undergone at least one prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening test.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, stratified by age and race, evaluated the relationship between IBD and the incidence of any PCa and clinically significant PCa (Gleason grade group ≥2). A mixed-effect regression model assessed the association of IBD with PSA level.  Results and limitations:   PCa incidence at 10yr was 4.4% among men with IBD and 0.65% among controls (hazard ratio [HR] 4.84 [3.34-7.02] [3.19-6.69], p<0.001). Clinically significant PCa incidence at 10yr was 2.4% for men with IBD and 0.42% for controls (HR 4.04 [2.52-6.48], p<0.001). After approximately age 60, PSA values were higher among patients with IBD (fixed-effect interaction of age and patient group: p=0.004).

The purpose of this study was to develop more potent analogs based upon CPZ pharmacophore and structure-activity relationships (SAR) across analogs. We generated 30 novel compounds and screened for their anti-proliferative effects in cultured HeLa cervical cancer cells. Cell viability assays identified multiple compounds with IC50s < 15 μM and one compound, 29 with an IC50 < 5 μM; six fold more potent than CPZ. We validated the anti-proliferative efficacy of two lead compounds, 17 and 29, in vivo using HeLa-derived xenografts in athymic nude mice. Both analogs significantly reduced tumor volumes by day 8 compared to control treated animals (p < 0.001) with no observable adverse effects. Calcium imaging determined that compound 17 activates TRPV1 whereas 29 neither activates nor inhibits TRPV1; indicating a unique mechanism-of-action that does not involve TRPV1 signaling. Cell viability assays using a panel of additional tumor types including oral squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, and prostate cancer cell lines (HSC-3, H460, MDA-231, and PC-3 respectively) demonstrated that both lead compounds were efficacious against every cancer type tested. Compounds 29 displayed IC50s of 1-2.5 μM in HSC-3and PC-3cells. Thus, we propose that these novel CPZ analogs may serve as efficacious therapeutic agents against multiple tumor types that warrant further development for clinical application.""","""['Jorge De La Chapa', 'Matthew Valdez', 'Franscisco Ruiz rd', 'Keith Gonzales', 'Wes Mitchell', 'Stanton F McHardy', 'Matthew Hart', 'Srikanth R Polusani', 'Cara B Gonzales']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem""","""['Corrigendum to ""Synthesis and SAR of novel capsazepine analogs with significant anti-cancer effects in multiple cancer types"" Bioorg.

A statistics-based model was proposed to predict the achievability of the planning criteria based on the structure set. A retrospective study was performed to validate the proposed model. A total of 160 prostate cases and 134 nasopharynx (NP) cases were used as the training set to build the model while 200 cases for each treatment site were used to validate the proposed model. An overlapping ratio and the minimum distance between organ at risks (OARs) and planning target volumes were used to predict the achievability of the planning criteria for serial organs. Since both prostate and NP cases were treated with simultaneous boost using multiple targets with different prescription doses, the effect of each parameter on the OARs was studied by binary logistic regression. For parallel organs, average distance to dose level was introduced and it described the dose falloff gradient within each OAR. By studying the distribution of average distance to dose level in the training set for each OAR, the result was used to predict the dose volume and average dose criteria. The accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing the predicted proportion and the actual proportion of the validation group that can achieve the clinical planning criteria. For prostate cases, the differences between the actual and predicted proportions were small for all criteria of rectum and bladder. The maximum deviations were 7% for bladder, 9% for rectum, and 5% for femur. For NP cases, the difference ranged from 0% to 7% with the largest difference found at the criterion D50% < 30 Gy of the parotids. In conclusion, the proposed statistics based plan prediction model was presented and the results showed the model could achieve acceptable prediction accuracy. The proposed tools could be used to calculate the probability of the OARs to achieve the clinical goals. This statistics based model can be further developed to adapt into the planning objective estimation in the auto-planning process.""","""['King Hang Wicger Wong', 'Hing Tong Lucullus Leung', 'Lai Wan Dora Kwong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Predicting dose-volume histograms for organs-at-risk in IMRT planning.', 'Experience-based quality control of clinical intensity-modulated radiotherapy planning.', 'Quantitative analysis of the factors which affect the interpatient organ-at-risk dose sparing variation in IMRT plans.', 'An improved distance-to-dose correlation for predicting bladder and rectum dose-volumes in knowledge-based VMAT planning for prostate cancer.', 'Impact of database quality in knowledge-based treatment planning for prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To identify Y-chromosomal long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with critical roles in PCa and to clarify the corresponding mechanisms.  Design, setting, and participants:   Aberrantly expressed lncRNAs on the Y chromosome were identified using transcriptome analysis of PCa clinical samples and cell lines. Biological functions and molecular mechanisms of the lncRNAs were revealed using in vitro and in vivo experimental methods.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Experiments and outcome measurements were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed for comparison of RNA levels in clinical cohorts. Analysis of variance was employed for comparisons among multiple groups.  Results and limitations:   In most patients with PCa, TTTY15 was the most elevated lncRNA located on the Y chromosome. Knockout of this lncRNA by two different CRISPR-Cas9 strategies suppressed PCa cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. TTTY15 promoted PCa by sponging the microRNA let-7, consequently increasing CDK6 and FN1 expression. FOXA1 is an upstream regulatory factor of TTTY15 transcription.  Conclusions:   The Y-chromosomal lncRNA TTTY15 was upregulated in most PCa tissues and could promote PCa progression by sponging let-7.  Patient summary:   We found that TTTY15 levels were frequently elevated in prostate cancer (PCa) tissues compared with those in paracancerous normal tissues in a large group of PCa patients, and we observed a tumour suppressive effect after TTTY15 knockout using CRISPR/Cas9.

It is unknown whether visual-registration targeting is sufficient or augmentation with image-fusion software is needed.  Objective:   To assess concordance between the two methods.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a blinded, within-person randomised, paired validating clinical trial. From 2014 to 2016, 141 men who had undergone a prior (positive or negative) transrectal ultrasound biopsy and had a discrete lesion on mpMRI (score 3-5) requiring targeted transperineal biopsy were enrolled at a UK academic hospital; 129 underwent both biopsy strategies and completed the study.  Intervention:   The order of performing biopsies using visual registration and a computer-assisted MRI/ultrasound image-fusion system (SmartTarget) on each patient was randomised. The equipment was reset between biopsy strategies to mitigate incorporation bias.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The proportion of clinically significant prostate cancer (primary outcome: Gleason pattern ≥3+4=7, maximum cancer core length ≥4mm; secondary outcome: Gleason pattern ≥4+3=7, maximum cancer core length ≥6mm) detected by each method was compared using McNemar's test of paired proportions.  Results and limitations:   The two strategies combined detected 93 clinically significant prostate cancers (72% of the cohort). Each strategy detected 80/93 (86%) of these cancers; each strategy identified 13 cases missed by the other. Three patients experienced adverse events related to biopsy (urinary retention, urinary tract infection, nausea, and vomiting). No difference in urinary symptoms, erectile function, or quality of life between baseline and follow-up (median 10.5 wk) was observed. The key limitations were lack of parallel-group randomisation and a limit on the number of targeted cores.  Conclusions:   Visual-registration and image-fusion targeting strategies combined had the highest detection rate for clinically significant cancers. Targeted prostate biopsy should be performed using both strategies together.  Patient summary:   We compared two prostate cancer biopsy strategies: visual registration and image fusion.

Methods:   Mixed-methods study incorporating UK-wide cross-sectional postal survey of men 18-42 months post-diagnosis and semi-structured interviews with a subsample (n = 97), including men who received both radical treatments and active surveillance. Interview data was analysed using a Framework approach.  Results:   Within the context of TDM, 'drivers' included men's intra-personal preferences for decision-making responsibility or clinical direction, relative treatment intrusiveness or desire for excision, and work, personal and social life priorities; 'facilitators' were inter-personal mechanisms such as information and communication with clinicians to enact, but also sometimes challenge drivers. Drivers and facilitators can conflict, challenging patient empowerment. Men frequently undertook greater TDM responsibility than desired, without clinical recommendations; others received conflicting recommendations. Information on potential side-effects was often reportedly inadequate. Unchallenged preferences, absence of clinical recommendations and inadequate preparation for side-effects sometimes led to decision regret.  Conclusions:   Men are not empowered when expected to take more TDM responsibility than desired, when provided with conflicting recommendations, or when their potentially inappropriate preferences are unchallenged.

RNA-seq analysis shows a subset of NF-κB pathway genes including PD-L1 are selectively upregulated by RB knockdown or CDK4/6 inhibitor. S249/T252-phosphorylated RB inversely correlates with PD-L1 expression in patient samples. Expression of a RB-derived S249/T252 phosphorylation-mimetic peptide suppresses radiotherapy-induced upregulation of PD-L1 and augments therapeutic efficacy of radiation in vivo.

Reported index lesion (IL) PI-RADS category was 2 in 23 (8.5%), 3 in 85 (32%), 4 in 98 (37%), and 5 in 13 (5%) men, respectively. It is noteworthy that in 30 examinations (11%), an IL was recognized by radiologists, but a suspicious score was not assigned. According to first reading of mpMRI, initial clinical strategy included performing a targeted (226; 85%) or a systematic biopsy (8; 3%), scheduling the patient to an active surveillance program without repeat biopsy (10; 4%), or monitoring prostate-specific antigen without prostate sampling (22; 8%). The mpMRI rereads did not change IL PI-RADS category in 91 cases (38.5%), although in 20 (8.5%) and 125 (53%) IL PI-RADS was upgraded or downgraded, respectively (κ = 0.23).

The accuracy was assessed by comparing couch shifts obtained with the EM methods to the couch shifts determined by simultaneous fiducial marker (FM) based orthogonal kilovoltage (kV) imaging. Agreement between the methods was compared using Bland-Altman analysis. Interfractional positional stability of the FMs, RayPilot transmitters and Calypso transponders was investigated. 582 fractions from 22 RayPilot patients and 335 fractions from 26 Calypso patients were analyzed. Mean (± standard deviation (SD)) differences between RayPilot and kV imaging were 0.3 ± 2.2, -2.2 ± 2.4 and -0.0 ± 1.0 mm in anterior-posterior (AP), superior-inferior (SI) and left-right (LR) directions, respectively. Corresponding 95% limits of agreement (LOA) were ±4.3, ±4.7 and ±2.1 mm around the mean. Mean (±SD) differences between Calypso and kV imaging were -0.2 ± 0.6, 0.1 ± 0.5 and -0.1 ± 0.4 mm in AP, SI and LR directions, respectively, and corresponding LOAs were ±1.3, ±1.0 and ±0.8 mm around the mean. FMs and transponders were stable: SD of intermarker and intertransponder distances was 0.5 mm. Transmitters were unstable: mean caudal transmitter shift of 1.8 ± 2.0 mm was observed. Results indicate that the localization accuracy of the Calypso is comparable to kV imaging of fiducials and the methods could be used interchangeably.

The locus, including the gene desert and its flanking genes, MYC, PVT1 and FAM84B, is also frequently amplified in human breast cancer. We generated a megadeletion (MD) mouse model lacking 430-Kb of sequence orthologous to the breast cancer-associated region in the gene desert. The goals were to examine the effect of the deletion on mammary cancer development and on transcript level regulation of the candidate genes within the locus.  Methods:   The MD allele was engineered using the MICER system in embryonic stem cells and bred onto 3 well-characterized transgenic models for breast cancer, namely MMTV-PyVT, MMTV-neu and C3(1)-TAg. Mammary tumor growth, latency, multiplicity and metastasis were compared between homozygous MD and wild type mice carrying the transgenes. A reciprocal mammary gland transplantation assay was conducted to distinguish mammary cell-autonomous from non-mammary cell-autonomous anti-cancer effects. Gene expression analysis was done using quantitative real-time PCR. Chromatin interactions were evaluated by 3C. Gene-specific patient outcome data were analysed using the METABRIC and TCGA data sets through the cBioPortal website.  Results:   Mice homozygous for the MD allele are viable, fertile, lactate sufficiently to nourish their pups, but maintain a 10% lower body weight mainly due to decreased adiposity. The deletion interferes with mammary tumorigenesis in mouse models for luminal and basal breast cancer. In the MMTV-PyVT model the mammary cancer-reducing effects of the allele are mammary cell-autonomous. We found organ-specific effects on transcript level regulation, with Myc and Fam84b being downregulated in mammary gland, prostate and mammary tumor samples. Through analysis using the METABRIC and TCGA datasets, we provide evidence that MYC and FAM84B are frequently co-amplified in breast cancer, but in contrast with MYC, FAM84B is frequently overexpressed in the luminal subtype, whereas MYC activity affect basal breast cancer outcomes.  Conclusion:   Deletion of a breast cancer-associated non-protein coding region affects mammary cancer development in 3 transgenic mouse models. We propose Myc as a candidate susceptibility gene, regulated by the gene desert locus, and a potential role for Fam84b in modifying breast cancer development.""","""['Collin Homer-Bouthiette', 'Yang Zhao', 'Lauren B Shunkwiler', 'Benjamine Van Peel', 'Elizabeth Garrett-Mayer', 'Rachael C Baird', 'Anna I Rissman', 'Stephen T Guest', 'Stephen P Ethier', 'Manorama C John', 'Patricia A Powers', 'Jill D Haag', 'Michael N Gould', 'Bart M G Smits']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The Oncogenic Potential of the Centromeric Border Protein FAM84B of the 8q24.21 Gene Desert.', 'Myc/p53 interactions in transgenic mouse mammary development, tumorigenesis and chromosomal instability.', 'Synergistic interaction of transforming growth factor alpha and c-myc in mouse mammary and salivary gland tumorigenesis.', 'The gene desert mammary carcinoma susceptibility locus Mcs1a regulates Nr2f1 modifying mammary epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation.', 'TGF beta regulation of cell proliferation.', 'MYC Inhibition Halts Metastatic Breast Cancer Progression by Blocking Growth, Invasion, and Seeding.', 'Reversible Myc hypomorphism identifies a key Myc-dependency in early cancer evolution.', '8q24.21 Locus: A Paradigm to Link Non-Coding RNAs, Genome Polymorphisms and Cancer.', 'The Oncogenic Potential of the Centromeric Border Protein FAM84B of the 8q24.21 Gene Desert.']"""

Metabolic adaptations in malignant PC cells play a key role in fueling the growth and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, little is known regarding these changes in cellular metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that centromere protein F (CENPF), a protein associated with the centromere-kinetochore complex and chromosomal segregation during mitosis, is mechanically linked to altered metabolism and progression in PC. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we silenced the gene for CENPF in human PC3 cells. These cells were found to have reduced levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Silencing of CENPF also simultaneously improved sensitivity to anoikis-induced apoptosis. Mass spectrometry analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from CENPF knockout (CENPFKO) and control cells revealed that CENPF silencing increased inactive forms of pyruvate kinase M2, a rate limiting enzyme needed for an irreversible reaction in glycolysis. Furthermore, CENPFKO cells had reduced global bio-energetic capacity, acetyl-CoA production, histone acetylation, and lipid metabolism, suggesting that CENPF is a critical regulator of cancer metabolism, potentially through its effects on mitochondrial functioning. Additional quantitative immunohistochemistry and imaging analyzes on a series of PC tumor microarrays demonstrated that CENPF expression is significantly increased in higher-risk PC patients. Based on these findings, we suggest the CENPF may be an important regulator of PC metabolism through its role in the mitochondria.""","""['Muhammad Shahid', 'Min Young Lee', 'Honit Piplani', 'Allen M Andres', 'Bo Zhou', 'Austin Yeon', 'Minjung Kim', 'Hyung L Kim', 'Jayoung Kim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Downregulation of CENPF Remodels Prostate Cancer Cells and Alters Cellular Metabolism.', 'Enhanced expression of centromere protein F predicts clinical progression and prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Centromere protein F is identified as a novel therapeutic target by genomics profile and contributing to the progression of pancreatic cancer.', 'PKM2, cancer metabolism, and the road ahead.', 'PKM2, a potential target for regulating cancer.', 'N6-methyladenosine modification of CENPF mRNA facilitates gastric cancer metastasis via regulating FAK nuclear export.', 'Integrated pan-cancer analysis of centromere protein F and experimental verification of its role and clinical significance in cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Deciphering the Prognostic and Therapeutic Significance of Cell Cycle Regulator CENPF: A Potential Biomarker of Prognosis and Immune Microenvironment for Patients with Liposarcoma.', 'Construction of a novel anoikis-related prognostic model and analysis of its correlation with infiltration of immune cells in neuroblastoma.', 'CENPF promotes the proliferation of renal cell carcinoma in vitro.']"""

Although surrogate end point candidates have been evaluated in the context of radiotherapy and short-term androgen deprivation (AD), potential surrogates under long-term (24 month) AD, a proven therapy in high-risk localized disease, have not been investigated.  Materials and methods:   In the NRG/RTOG 9202 randomized trial (N = 1,520) of short-term AD (4 months) versus long-term AD (LTAD; 28 months), the time interval free of biochemical failure (IBF) was evaluated in relation to clinical end points of prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) and overall survival (OS). Survival modeling and landmark analysis methods were applied to evaluate LTAD benefit on IBF and clinical end points, association between IBF and clinical end points, and the mediating effect of IBF on LTAD clinical end point benefits.  Results:   LTAD was superior to short-term AD for both biochemical failure (BF) and the clinical end points. Men remaining free of BF for 3 years had relative risk reductions of 39% for OS and 73% for PCSS. Accounting for 3-year IBF status reduced the LTAD OS benefit from 12% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.98) to 6% (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.07). For PCSS, the LTAD benefit was reduced from 30% (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.82) to 6% (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.22). Among men with BF, by 3 years, 50% of subsequent deaths were attributed to prostate cancer, compared with 19% among men free of BF through 3 years.  Conclusion:   The IBF satisfied surrogacy criteria and identified the benefit of LTAD on disease-specific survival and OS.

Patients and methods:   Eighty-six patients from September 2012 to January 2017 in our center were retrospectively analyzed. Oncological outcomes included histological absence of prostate cancer, biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) as well as the absence of lesions suspected for harboring prostate cancer in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Regarding functional outcomes, we determined international prostate symptom score (IPSS), pad-free rate, pad-free and leakage-free rates as well as international index of erectile function-5 (IIEF-5).  Results:   Of the 86 patients, 25 patients who underwent non-whole-gland HIFU and 61 patients who underwent whole-gland HIFU were enrolled in our 1-year follow-up study. There were no significant differences in histological absence of prostate cancer (p = 0.655), BDFS (p = 0.820), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir (p = 0.453), and absence of suspicious lesions in mpMRI (p = 0.633) between non-whole-gland HIFU group and whole-gland HIFU group. However, compared with the whole-gland HIFU, the non-whole-gland HIFU group had fewer IPSS at 1 month (8.64 ± 3.63 vs 10.85 ± 6.10), a longer time to PSA nadir (5.04 ± 2.07 vs 3.83 ± 1.65), less temporary urine retention rate (20.0% vs 44.3%), less complication rate especially urinary tract strictures (4% vs 26.2%), whereas pad-free rate, pad-free and leakage-free rates, and IIEF scores were comparable.

A synergistic effect on the growth inhibition and the apoptosis of DU145 cells was observed when compound 6e was used in combination with TRAIL. OdDHL or 6e treatment concentration-dependently activated TRAIL death receptor DR5 which may account for the observed synergistic effect of 6e or OdDHL with TRAIL on the growth inhibition and cell apoptosis. Compound 6e also inhibited migration of DU145 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.

Methods:   MRI-ultrasound targeted biopsy of regions of interest and concurrent 12-core systematic biopsy was performed on men with Gleason grade group (GG) 1 and 2. We compared Decipher score with PI-RADS scores and biopsy Gleason GG. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP), and men with Decipher testing from a targeted biopsy core.  Results:   One hundred two patients with GG1 and GG2 had biopsy Decipher testing. There was no significant difference in the median Decipher scores among the 3 multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging categories. Patients with GG2 vs GG1 in the setting of PI-RADS 4-5 had higher genomic scores (P = .01), but no significant difference was noted in patients with PI-RADS ≤3. The rate of genomic higher-risk disease on a targeted biopsy from PI-RADS5 was higher in GG2 (75%) vs GG1 (11.1%; P = .01). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the Decipher score ≥0.45, (odds ratio (OR) 2.71; P = .02), and age (OR 1.11; P = .004) remained significant factors associated with Gleason GG2 on biopsy.  Conclusion:   High-risk genomic classification can be seen across all combinations of PI-RADS categories and Gleason GG1 and GG2, confirming a potential utility for Decipher testing in men with low- to favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The Decipher biopsy genomic test related to Gleason GG independent of PI-RADSv2 score.

Informed by observations that class I androgen and estrogen receptor variants display ligand-independent signaling in human cancer tissues, we questioned whether the function of class II NRs, like the vitamin D receptor (VDR), would also respond to alternative splicing regulation. Artificial VDR constructs lacking exon 3 (Dex3-VDR), encoding part of the DNA binding domain (DBD), and exon 8 (Dex8-VDR), encoding part of the ligand binding domain (LBD), were transiently transfected into DU-145 cells and stably-integrated into Caco-2 cells to study their effect on gene expression and cell viability. Changes in VDR promoter signaling were monitored by the expression of target genes (e.g. CYP24A1, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5). Ligand-independent VDR signaling was observed in variants lacking exon 8, and a significant loss of gene suppressor function was documented for variants lacking exon 3. The gain-of-function behavior of the Dex8-VDR variant was recapitulated in vitro using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) that induce the skipping of exon 8 in wild-type VDR. ASO targeting the splice acceptor site of exon 8 significantly stimulated ligand-independent VDR reporter activity and the induction of CYP24A1 above controls.

We found that resveratrol up-regulates DUSP1 expression in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, which in turn, is involved in the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway and Cox-2 expression. This phosphatase is required for the induction of apoptosis achieved by resveratrol, but does not regulate the effects of this compound on cell cycle. Furthermore, we show that resveratrol cooperates with cisplatin both in the up-regulation of DUSP1 levels and in the promotion of apoptosis, suggesting that DUSP1 is a major determinant of cisplatin sensitivity to apoptosis.

Implementation of one of the Guideline recommendations requires an estimate of 7-year mortality.  Design:   Prospective cohort study using questionnaire data linked to mortality data.  Setting:   Men aged ≥45years randomly sampled from the general population of New South Wales, Australia, participating in the 45 and Up Study.  Participants:   123 697 men who completed the baseline postal questionnaire (distributed from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008) and gave informed consent for follow-up through linkage of their data to population health databases.  Primary outcome measures:   The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.  Results:   12 160 died during follow-up (median=5.9 years). Following age-adjustment, self-reported health was the strongest predictor of all-cause mortality (C-index: 0.827; 95% CI 0.824 to 0.831). Three prediction models for all-cause mortality were validated, with predictors: Model-1: age group and self-rated health; Model-2: variables common to the 45 and Up Study and the Australian Health Survey and subselected using stepwise regression and Model-3: all variables selected using stepwise regression. Final predictions calibrated well with observed all-cause mortality rates. The 90th percentile for the 7-year mortality risks ranged from 1.92% to 83.94% for ages 45-85 years.  Conclusions:   We developed prediction scores for short-term mortality using age and self-reported health measures and validated the scores against national mortality rates. Along with age, simple measures such as self-rated health, which can be easily obtained without physical examination, were strong predictors of all-cause mortality in the 45 and Up Study. Seven-year mortality risk estimates from Model-3 suggest that the impact of the mortality risk prediction tool on men's decision making would be small in the recommended age (50-69 years) for PSA testing, but it may discourage testing at older ages.""","""['Grace Joshy', 'Emily Banks', 'Anthony Lowe', 'Rory Wolfe', 'Leonie Tickle', 'Bruce Armstrong', 'Mark Clements']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Poor Follow-up After Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen Tests: A Population-based Cohort Study.', 'Improving the Specificity of Screening for Lethal Prostate Cancer Using Prostate-specific Antigen and a Panel of Kallikrein Markers: A Nested Case-Control Study.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

Thus, we hypothesized that 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT before radiotherapy significantly affects the radiotherapeutic approach in comparison to the current standard, a CT-based approach. Methods: Between February 2014 and December 2017, 172 patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT before radiotherapy and were included in this retrospective analysis. Twenty-two (13%) patients were referred for primary definitive radiotherapy, 51% (88/172) for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence, and 36% (62/172) for PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy. An experienced radiation oncologist, masked to the CT and PET/CT results, decided on the radiation treatment management of all patients on the basis of the clinical and pathologic variables. The potential increase in diagnostic accuracy, and the subsequent change in radiotherapeutic approach, were documented separately for PET/CT versus CT. Results: The overall detection rate was 70% (120/172) for 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Patients with a pre-PET/CT PSA level of more than 0.5 ng/mL (98/111; 88%) had PET-positive results significantly more often. Overall, PSMA PET/CT revealed 171 lesions, PET alone 156, and CT alone 85. For all patients, a continuous diagnostic increase in positive findings was observed for primary tumor/local recurrence (CT, 18%, vs. PET/CT, 37%), pelvic lymph nodes (CT, 21%, vs. PET/CT, 44%), and distant metastases (CT, 7%, vs. PET/CT, 19%) when comparing CT with PET/CT. Compared with CT, the combination of PET/CT information resulted in a change in treatment in 107 of 172 (62%) patients, that is, 8 of 22 (36%) patients before any treatment, 31 of 62 (50%) with PSA recurrence, and 68 of 88 (77%) with PSA persistence. Comparing the different radiotherapy indications with one another, there was a higher rate of change in management for postoperative patients than for patients before any treatment. Conclusion: Compared with conventional CT, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT had a remarkable impact on radiotherapeutic approach, especially in postoperative patients. Thus, considering the growing amount of data on the impact of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT on postoperative patients, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT has recently been endorsed by a few cancer guidelines as an imaging modality in patients with PSA persistence or recurrence (e.g., the German S3 guideline and the European Association of Urology guideline).""","""['Nina-Sophie Schmidt-Hegemann', 'Chukwuka Eze', 'Minglun Li', 'Paul Rogowski', 'Christian Schaefer', 'Christian Stief', 'Alexander Buchner', 'Constantinos Zamboglou', 'Wolfgang Peter Fendler', 'Ute Ganswindt', 'Clemens Cyran', 'Peter Bartenstein', 'Claus Belka', 'Harun Ilhan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Mapping of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy in 270 Patients with a PSA Level of Less Than 1.0 ng/mL: Impact on Salvage Radiotherapy Planning.', 'Detection level and pattern of positive lesions using PSMA PET/CT for staging prior to radiation therapy.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Importance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in hospital practice.

Methods: Serial 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was prospectively performed at baseline and on days 9, 18, and 28 in 8 men with measurable metastatic hormone-sensitive PCa commencing LHRH ± bicalutamide (cohort 1) and 7 men with castrate-resistant PCa commencing either enzalutamide or abiraterone (cohort 2). Gleason score, age, time since diagnosis, and prior treatments were documented. Testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were measured at baseline and all imaging time points. PET/CT was quantitatively analyzed for SUVmax, SUVmean, and total tumor volume. Results: In cohort 1, a median 30% (interquartile range [IQR], 5-61) reduction in SUVmax was recorded by day 9 after AB. A reduction from baseline SUVmax occurred in 86.5% (6/7) men by day 9 (P < 0.04), with an associated PSA response in 100% men (P < 0.03). Total tumor volume reduced in all men by 74.5% (IQR, 27-97) (P < 0.02). After day 9, PSMA response heterogeneity was noted, with persistently high or increasing SUVmax in 37.5% (3/8) and marked reduction in 62.5% (5/8). In cohort 2, a median 45% (IQR, 12.7-66) increase in intensity of PSMA SUV was recorded by day 9 after AB. All men demonstrated an increase in SUVmax and SUVmean on PSMA PET compared with baseline (P < 0.04). This increase at day 9 plateaued by day 28.

The compounds were ranked by PSMA affinity and albumin affinity and were radiolabeled with 68Ga and 177Lu. Tissue kinetics were determined in male BALB/C nu/nu mice bearing LNCaP xenograft tumors. Results: Each of the compounds binds PSMA with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of no more than 10 nM. The albumin-binding group had a minimal effect on PSMA affinity but changed albumin affinity by an order of magnitude. However, the addition of a polyethylene glycol 8 spacer weakened affinity for albumin in each case. Increased affinity for albumin corresponded with delayed blood clearance and modified uptake kinetics in the tumor and kidney. Uptake of 177Lu-RPS-072 (34.9 ± 2.4 %ID/g) and 177Lu-RPS-077 (27.4 ± 0.6 %ID/g) increased up to 24 h after injection, and washout by 96 h was not significant. As a result, the area under the curve (AUC) in the tumor was in the following order: 177Lu-RPS-072 > 177Lu-RPS-077 > 177Lu-RPS-063 > 177Lu-RPS-071. Increased linker length corresponded to more rapid clearance from kidneys. Consequently, the ratio of tumor AUC and kidney AUC was 4.7 ± 0.3 for 177Lu-RPS-072. Conclusion: The tumor AUC and tumor-to-kidney ratio of 177Lu-RPS-072 are significantly enhanced compared with any small molecule investigated in a LNCaP xenograft model to date. In comparison to other PSMA-targeting radioligands that have been evaluated in a PC3-PIP model, activity in kidneys is reduced and activity in tumors compares favorably when the different PSMA expression levels in LNCaP and PC3-PIP cells are considered. RPS-072 therefore exhibits an increased therapeutic index, shows the potential to increase the dose delivered to tumors, and is a highly promising candidate for targeted radioligand therapy.""","""['James M Kelly', 'Alejandro Amor-Coarasa', 'Shashikanth Ponnala', 'Anastasia Nikolopoulou', 'Clarence Williams Jr', 'Stephen G DiMagno', 'John W Babich']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Trifunctional PSMA-targeting constructs for prostate cancer with unprecedented localization to LNCaP tumors.', 'Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Optimization of the Tissue Distribution Profile.', 'Preclinical Development of Novel PSMA-Targeting Radioligands: Modulation of Albumin-Binding Properties To Improve Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals for Imaging and Therapy.', 'Targeted Alpha-Particle Therapy: A Review of Current Trials.', 'A DNA-encoded chemical library based on chiral 4-amino-proline enables stereospecific isozyme-selective protein recognition.', 'Covalent Proteins as Targeted Radionuclide Therapies Enhance Antitumor Effects.', 'Imageological/Structural Study regarding the Improved Pharmacokinetics by 68Ga-Labeled PEGylated PSMA Multimer in Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA-GCK01: A Generator-Based 99mTc/188Re Theranostic Ligand for the Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.']"""

Since transcriptional reactivation or ectopic-mediated expression of XAF1 inhibits tumor growth, it is of great interest to elucidate the molecular mechanisms leading to XAF1 silencing. YY1 is a transcription factor that acts as a repressor or an activator to modulate several cancer-associated cellular processes. Both YY1 and XAF1 have key roles in prostate cancer (PCa) progression and are associated with worse clinical outcomes. To assess whether YY1 regulates the transcriptional activation of the XAF1 gene, we performed gene-reporter assays coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, which showed that YY1 is able to mediate XAF1 silencing. Concordantly, ChIP-qPCR assays showed that YY1 interacts with the XAF1 promoter in PC3 cells that lacks XAF1 expression. This association was lost after exposure to epigenetic modulators that induce XAF1 expression. Further supporting the YY1's repressive role, we found transcriptional reactivation of the XAF1 gene by YY1 downregulation. As expected by previous reports showing that HDAC1 is needed for YY1-mediated repressive actions, we observed XAF1 re-expression after either inhibition or downregulation of the HDAC1 gene. Finally, expression data retrieved from the TCGA consortium showed that PCa samples presented lower XAF1 and higher HDAC expression levels than normal tissues. Thus, our results support a model in which YY1 is able to silence tumor suppressor genes such as XAF1 through HDAC1 in PCa.""","""['B Camacho-Moctezuma', 'M Quevedo-Castillo', 'J Melendez-Zajgla', 'G Aquino-Jarquin', 'G U Martinez-Ruiz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Epigenetic silencing of the XAF1 gene is mediated by the loss of CTCF binding.', 'Recruitment of HDAC4 by transcription factor YY1 represses HOXB13 to affect cell growth in AR-negative prostate cancers.', 'YY1 promotes HDAC1 expression and decreases sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to HDAC inhibitor.', 'The Yin and Yang of YY1 in tumor growth and suppression.', 'Yin Yang 1: a multifaceted protein beyond a transcription factor.', 'Upregulation of Yin-Yang-1 Associates with Proliferation and Glutamine Metabolism in Esophageal Carcinoma.', 'Epigenetic mechanisms underlying prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'Transcription factors CP2 and YY1 as prognostic markers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas and a second independent cohort.', 'The USP21/YY1/SNHG16 axis contributes to tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion of non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'YY1 promotes colorectal cancer proliferation through the miR-526b-3p/E2F1 axis.']"""

Given the emergence of single-cell mRNA sequencing technologies, a method is needed to isolate CTCs with high sensitivity and specificity as well as compatibility with downstream genomic analysis. Flow cytometry is a powerful tool to analyze and sort single cells, but pre-enrichment is required prior to flow sorting for efficient isolation of CTCs due to the extreme low frequency of CTCs in blood (one in billions of blood cells). While current enrichment technologies often require many steps and result in poor recovery, we demonstrate a magnetic separator and acoustic microfluidic focusing chip integrated system that enriches rare cells in-line with FACS™ (fluorescent activated cell sorting) and single-cell sequencing.

Men were equally likely to receive radical treatment, irrespective of whether they were diagnosed in a hub (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91-1.08).

Methods:   Forty-two patients with previously negative or doubtful 18F-Choline (FCH) were enrolled. PET images were recorded 1 h after injection of tracer. Only a few months after treatment ended, a PSA assay was requested to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment based on PSMA results.  Results:   PSMA-positive lesions were detected in 34/42 (80.9%) patients. Detection rates were 85.7% and 89.3% for serum PSA levels lower than 2 ng/mL, and >2 ng/mL, respectively. One hundred seventy-three lesions were detected: 132/173 in lymph nodes (76.3%), 22/173 as metastatic sites (bone or lung) (12.7%), and 19/173 in the prostate bed (10.9%). As a result of the PSMA PET-CT, therapeutic management changed in 31/42 patients (73.8%).

Facilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) is involved in DNA repair, replication and transcription by eviction of histones or loosening their contact with DNA. While FACT expression is known to be high in a range of cancers, the biological significance of the aberrant increase is not clear. We found that in prostate and lung cancer cells FACT mRNA and protein levels were low at G0 compared to the proliferating state but replenished upon cell cycle re-entry. Silencing of FACT with Dox-inducible shRNA hindered cell cycle re-entry by G0 cancer cells, which could be rescued by ectopic expression of FACT. An increase in SKP2, c-MYC and PIRH2 and a decrease in p27 protein levels seen upon cell cycle re-entry were prevented or diminished when FACT was silenced. Further, using mVenus-p27K- infected cancer cells to measure p27 degradation capacity, we confirm that inhibition of FACT at release from quiescence suppressed the p27 degradation capacity resulting in an increased mVenus-p27K- signal.

It has been reported that post-prostatectomy UI is related to the width of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) and the length of the urethra. However, the details of these anatomical parameters are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether preoperative pelvic parameters or anatomical parameters of the urethra, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are correlated with UI.  Methods:   Between 2010 and 2017, 571 patients with localized PCa underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) at Okayama University Hospital. Patients treated by a single experienced surgeon were included in the study. Preoperative prostate volume, obturator internal muscle, anal sphincter muscle, levator ani muscle (LAM), urethra wall thickness (UWT), and membranous urethral length (MUL) were measured by MRI. Patients were divided into two groups depending on leakage status 1 year after RARP using Expanded Prostate Index Composite Item 1.  Results:   Seventy patients were included in this retrospective study. Based on leakage status, 37 and 33 patients were allocated to the no-leakage and leakage groups, respectively. There were significant differences between the two groups in age (P = 0.03), MUL (P < 0.001), UWT (P = 0.03), and LAM (P = 0.001).

Recruitment strategies included the following: cancer support groups, researchers' networks, media advertisement, religious organisations, National Health Service hospitals and snowball sampling. Thirty-six eligible participants (men = 25, partners = 11) were recruited into the study. Recruitment barriers comprised of gate-keeping and advertisement issues and the stigma associated with prostate cancer disclosure. Facilitators which aided recruitment included collaborating with National Health Service hospitals, snowball sampling, flexible data collection, building rapport with participants to gain their trust and researcher's attributes. Findings highlight that ""hard to reach"" Black African/Caribbean populations may be more accessible if researchers adopt flexible but strategic and culturally sensitive recruitment approaches. Such approaches should consider perceptions of stigma associated with prostate cancer within these communities and the influence gatekeepers can have in controlling access to potential participants.

Previous studies have confirmed the importance of CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) in the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer. And increasing evidence prove that Notch1 can play diametrically opposite roles in the development and progression of different tumors. To demonstrate the correlation between CCR7 and Notch1, PC-3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-CCR7 or CCR7 si-RNA, respectively. Then Western blot analysis was used to detect the expressions of Notch1, ERK, P38, JNK, NF-κB, MMP-9, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. Moreover, matrigel invasion assays were performed to assess the migratory and invasive activities of PC-3 cells. PcDNA3.1-CCR7 increased the expression of Notch1, phospho-MAPK, phospho-P65, MMP-9, N-cadherin, and Snail in PC-3 cells, but decreased the expression of E-cadherin. PcDNA3.1-CCR7 also promoted the migration and invasion of PC-3 cells. However, CCR7 si-RNA reversed the effect of pcDNA3.1-CCR7 in PC-3 cells. And MAPK and NF-κB pathway inhibitors were used to testify that activation of Notch1 induces EMT through MAPK and NF-κB pathway. All these results indicate that upregulation of Notch1 by CCR7 can accelerate the evolution of EMT and develop the invasion and metastasis in prostate cancer cells by activating MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells, which provides a new molecular evidence for targeted therapy in metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Ruoyang Du', 'Guanlin Tang', 'Zhaobing Tang', 'Youlin Kuang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['MiRNALet-7a mediates prostate cancer PC-3 cell invasion, migration by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition through CCR7/MAPK pathway.', 'CCL21/CCR7 Axis Contributed to CD133+ Pancreatic Cancer Stem-Like Cell Metastasis via EMT and Erk/NF-κB Pathway.', 'CCR7 regulates cell migration and invasion through MAPKs in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck.', 'Chemokine (C‑C motif) ligand 21/C‑C chemokine receptor type 7 triggers migration and invasion of human lung cancer cells by epithelial‑mesenchymal transition via the extracellular signal‑regulated kinase signaling pathway.', 'CX3CL1 increases invasiveness and metastasis by promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through the TACE/TGF-α/EGFR pathway in hypoxic androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'LncRNA BCAR4 promotes migration, invasion, and chemo-resistance by inhibiting miR-644a in breast cancer.', 'lncRNA DARS-AS1 Promoted Osteosarcoma Progression through Regulating miR-532-3p/CCR7.', 'Metastasis and MAPK Pathways.', 'C-C Chemokine Receptor 7 in Cancer.', 'Clinical and prognostic significance of CC chemokine receptor type 8 protein expression in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.']"""

Methods:   Spouses of men diagnosed with prostate cancer within the past 18 months (N = 164) were randomly assigned to PST (n = 78) or usual psychosocial care (UPC; n = 86). Spouses completed measures of constructive and dysfunctional problem solving, cancer-related distress, mood, physical and mental health, and dyadic adjustment at preintervention and post-intervention and 3-month post-intervention follow-up.  Results:   Constructive problem solving increased from pre-intervention to post-intervention among spouses receiving PST but not for spouses receiving UPC; this was maintained at follow-up. There was no decrease in dysfunctional problem solving. Spouses receiving PST versus UPC reported less cancer-related distress post-intervention and at follow-up. There were no significant changes in mood or physical and mental health. Dyadic adjustment was significantly better for spouses receiving PST versus UPC at post-intervention but not at follow-up. Improvements in constructive problem solving mediated better mood and dyadic adjustment post-intervention.

In this study, we discuss our technique of anterior reconstruction of the puboprostatic ligament during RALP and its effect on the continence outcome postoperatively.  Methods:   In this retrospective study, the data of 95 consecutive patients were analyzed and the patients were divided in two groups; the control group ""group A"" (47 patients) and the anterior reconstruction group ""group B"" (48 patients). The primary endpoint of this study was to compare both groups as regards the postoperative continence rates.  Results:   Complete continence (no pads) rates were reported at time of catheter removal (T0), 1 month (T1), 4 months (T4), 6 months (T6) and 12 months (T12) postoperatively. Moreover, the social continence (0-1 security pad) was reported at 12 months postoperatively. Complete continence was significantly different between both groups at T0 and T6 (P=0.022, and P=0.035 respectively). The social continence was not significantly different between both groups (85.1% vs. 89.6% in group A vs. group B).  Conclusions:   Despite anterior reconstruction of the puboprostatic ligament showed no significant effect on the overall continence, it showed earlier return to continence up to 6 months, which supports the theory that anterior puboprostatic reconstruction may provide better immediate continence and shorten the time to continence for RALP patients. However, most of the published literature showed better continence rates with the total anatomical reconstruction (combined anterior and posterior). Therefore, we started to offer patients in our center total anatomical reconstruction during RALP.""","""['Stefano Puliatti', 'Ahmed Elsherbiny', 'Ahmed Eissa', 'Giacomo Pirola', 'Elena Morini', 'Denise Squecco', 'Raffaele Inzillo', 'Ahmed Zoeir', 'Andrea Iseppi', 'Maria C Sighinolfi', 'Salvatore Micali', 'Bernardo Rocco', 'Giampaolo Bianchi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Minerva Urol Nefrol""","""['Retzius-sparing versus standard robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Posterior musculofascial reconstruction in robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Anterior suspension combined with posterior reconstruction during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy improves early return of urinary continence: a prospective randomized multicentre trial.', 'Posterior musculofascial reconstruction in robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localised prostate cancer: a Cochrane Review.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Longer preserved urethral length in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy significantly contributes to post-operative urinary continence recovery.', 'Retropubic TFS Minisling for Postprostatectomy Male Incontinence: First Report.', 'Surgical techniques to improve continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Regenerative potential of human dental pulp stem cells in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence: In vitro and in vivo study.']"""

This phase Ib study in cancer patients with bone metastases evaluated the safety of radium-223 and paclitaxel.  Methods:   Eligible patients had solid tumor malignancies with ≥2 bone metastases and were candidates for paclitaxel. Treatment included seven paclitaxel cycles (90 mg/m2 per week intravenously per local standard of care; 3 weeks on/1 week off) plus six radium-223 cycles (55 kBq/kg intravenously; one injection every 4 weeks, starting at paclitaxel cycle 2). The primary end point was percentage of patients with grade 3/4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia during coadministration of radium-223 and paclitaxel (cycles 2, 3) versus paclitaxel alone (cycle 1).  Results:   Of 22 enrolled patients, 15 were treated (safety population), with 7 completing all six radium-223 cycles. Treated patients had primary cancers of breast (n = 7), prostate (n = 4), bladder (n = 1), non-small cell lung (n = 1), myxofibrosarcoma (n = 1), and neuroendocrine (n = 1). No patients discontinued treatment from toxicity of the combination. In the 13 patients who completed cycle 3, the rates of grade 3 neutropenia in cycles 2 and 3 were 31% and 8%, respectively, versus 23% in cycle 1; there were no cases of grade 4 neutropenia or grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. Breast cancer subgroup safety results were similar to the overall safety population.  Conclusion:   Radium-223 was tolerated when combined with weekly paclitaxel, with no clinically relevant additive toxicities.

In the present study, fluorescent probes of quantum dots (QDs) conjugated with a prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) monoclonal antibody (QD-PSCA) were prepared to study the targeted imaging of QD-PSCA probes in EJ human bladder urothelial cancer cells and analyze the feasibility of QD-based non-invasive tumor-targeted imaging in vivo. QDs with an emission wavelength of 605 nm (QD605) were conjugated with PSCA to prepare QD605-PSCA fluorescent probes by chemical covalent coupling. The optical properties of the probes coupled and uncoupled with PSCA were measured and assessed using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer and a fluorescence spectrophotometer. Direct immune-fluorescent labeling was utilized to detect and analyze imaging of the probes for EJ cells. The results revealed that QD605-PSCA probes retained the fluorescent properties of QD605 and the immunogenicity of the PSCA protein. The probes were able to specifically recognize the PSCA protein expressed in bladder cancer cells, while fluorescence was stable and had a long duration.

However, the cumulative effect of multiple lower-grade AEs may also impact patients' quality of life (QoL). Further, patient-reported toxicity may be more representative of patients' treatment experiences. This study aimed to determine whether cumulative toxicity comprising all-grade AEs is more associated with QoL than cumulative toxicity comprising high-grade AEs only, and whether patient-reported cumulative toxicity is more associated with QoL than clinician-reported cumulative toxicity. Methods: Patients with metastatic castration-naïve prostate cancer participating in the phase III GETUG-AFU 15 trial completed questionnaires on AEs (at 3 and 6 months) and QoL (at baseline and 3 and 6 months). Clinicians reported AEs during clinical visits. Cumulative toxicity scores were calculated for clinicians and patients in 3 ways: total number of high-grade AEs, total number of all-grade AEs, and total number of all AEs multiplied by their grade (severity score). Relationships between cumulative toxicity scores and QoL were studied using longitudinal regression analyses; unstandardized (B) and standardized regression coefficients (β) are reported. Results: Of 385 patients, 184 with complete QoL and toxicity data were included. Clinician-reported all-grade AEs (B, -2.2; 95% CI, -3.3 to -1.1; P<.01) and severity score (B, -1.4; 95% CI, -2.2 to -0.7; P<.01) were associated with deteriorated physical QoL, whereas the total number of high-grade AEs was not. All patient-reported scores were significantly (P<.01 for all) associated with deteriorated physical and global QoL. Standardized regression coefficients indicated that patient-reported toxicity scores were more associated with QoL outcomes than clinician-reported scores, with the strongest association found for the all-grade AEs and severity cumulative toxicity scores. Conclusions: Patient- and clinician-based cumulative toxicity scores comprising all-grade AEs better reflect impact on patient QoL than toxicity scores comprising high-grade AEs only. To assess the effect of toxicity on QoL, patient-reported cumulative toxicity scores are preferred.""","""['Claudia S E W Schuurhuizen', 'Patricia Marino', 'Annemarie M J Braamse', 'Laurien M Buffart', 'Florence Joly', 'Karim Fizazi', 'Muriel Habibian', 'Jean-Marie Boher', 'Michel Soulie', 'Stéphane Oudard', 'Inge R H M Konings', 'Henk M W Verheul', 'Joost Dekker', 'Gwenaelle Gravis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['The predictive value of cumulative toxicity for quality of life in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer during first-line palliative chemotherapy.', 'Q-TWiST analysis of patients with metastatic castrate naive prostate cancer treated by androgen deprivation therapy with or without docetaxel in the randomised phase III GETUG-AFU 15 trial.', 'Evaluation of Scores to Reflect Toxicity Impact on Quality of Life of Patients With Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer: AURELIA Substudy.', 'Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Addition of Docetaxel to Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Patients with Hormone-sensitive Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Psychometrics of patient-reported bother from side effects of treatment single-items in industry-sponsored oncology trials.', 'Development and Validation of a Predictive Model for Toxicity of Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Rectal Cancer in the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 Phase III Trial.', 'Surviving Elderly Patients with Head-and-Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma-What Is the Long-Term Quality of Life after Curative Radiotherapy?', 'Assessment of Food and Drug Administration- and European Medicines Agency-Approved Systemic Oncology Therapies and Clinically Meaningful Improvements in Quality of Life: A Systematic Review.', 'Therapy preferences in melanoma treatment-Willingness to pay and preference of quality versus length of life of patients, physicians, healthy individuals and physicians with oncological disease.']"""

In the past 10 years in Iran, prostate cancer has increased and become more common among hormone-related cancers. As the percentage of seniors in the population increases, the economic burden of this cancer will likely increase significantly. This study aims to estimate direct and indirect costs of treatment at different stages of prostate cancer in Iran.  Methods:   This cross-sectional study was conducted on 263 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer who were referred to prostate treatment centers in 2016. Data on direct medical costs were collected by face-to-face interviews with patients and from health care files and medical and financial documents available in the educational or referral centers. Direct nonmedical costs and indirect costs were based on self-reports by patients through face-to-face interview.  Findings:   The results indicate that mean (SD) direct medical costs for low-risk metastatic prostate cancer, local nonmetastatic prostate cancer, local regionalized nonmetastatic prostate cancer nonresistant metastatic prostate cancer, and resistant metastatic prostate cancer were $102.79 ($33.03), US$2673.43 ($87.42), $2210.51 ($306.92), $4133.15 ($650.87), and $7747.89 ($455.80), respectively. The results indicate that mean (SD) direct nonmedical costs for low-risk, local, local regionalized, nonresistant, and resistant cancers were $97.06 ($45.00), $339.71 ($58.02), $485.29 ($36.77), $776.47 ($99.25), and $1067.65 ($600.92), respectively, and mean (SD) indirect costs for these categories were $23.85 ($20.44), $83.49 ($65.06), $119.27 ($32.59), $238.54 ($87.35), and $357.81 ($73.00), respectively.  Implications:   The findings of this research indicate that patients diagnosed with prostate cancer must bear high costs at advanced stages of the disease, whereas in the early stages of the disease, the medical costs are relatively low. The health system of Iran should work to prevent patients from reaching the metastatic stages of the disease by implementing a suitable screening system for timely diagnosis of the disease and its effective treatment.""","""['Mohammad M Mojahedian', 'Mahdi Toroski', 'Khosro Keshavarz', 'Mahdi Aghili', 'Shahryar Zeyghami', 'Shekoufeh Nikfar']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Ther""","""['Economic Burden of Gastric Cancer: A Case of Iran.', 'The economic burden of prostate cancer, California, 1998.', 'Evaluating Direct Costs of Gastric Cancer Treatment in Iran - Case Study in Kerman City in 2015.', ""Economic burden of Huntington disease in Europe and the USA: Results from the Huntington's Disease Burden of Illness study."", 'Financial toxicity associated with treatment of localized prostate cancer.', 'Global and regional quality of care index for prostate cancer: an analysis from the Global Burden of Disease study 1990-2019.', 'Determinants and economic burden of HIV/AIDS in Iran: a prospective study.', 'Targeting the MALAT1 gene with the CRISPR/Cas9 technique in prostate cancer.', 'The economic burden of prostate cancer in Eswatini.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of rituximab versus natalizumab in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.']"""

Materials and methods:   Forty-eight patients with biopsy-proven PCa of different Gleason grade (GG), who provided written informed consent, were enrolled. All subjects underwent 3T DWI examinations by using b values 0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 s/mm2 and six gradient directions. Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent kurtosis (K), apparent kurtosis-derived diffusivity (D), and proxy fractional kurtosis anisotropy (KFA) maps were obtained. Regions of interest were selected in PCa, in the contralateral benign zone, and in the peritumoral area. Histogram analysis was performed by measuring mean, 10th, 25th, and 90th (p90) percentile of the whole-lesion volume. Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni correction was used to assess significant differences between different regions of interest. The correlation between diffusion metrics and GG and between DKI and DTI parameters was evaluated with Pearson's test. ROC curve analysis was carried out to analyze the ability of histogram variables to differentiate low- and high-GG PCa.  Results:   All metrics significantly discriminated PCa from benign and from peritumoral tissue (except for K, KFAp90, and FA). Kp90 showed the highest correlation with GG and the best diagnostic ability (area under the curve = 0.84) in discriminating low- from high-risk PCa.

In this study, we focused on the metabolites that are released by prostate cancer cells (PCC), which could potentially attenuate T cell immunity.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cells (PCC) media (PCM) was used to treat T cells, and its impact on T cell signaling was evaluated. The molecular mechanism was further verified in vivo using mouse models. The clinical significance was determined using IHC in human clinical specimens. Liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC/MS-MS) was used to identify the metabolites that are released by PCC, which trigger T cells inactivation.  Results:   PCM inhibits T cells proliferation and impairs their ability to produce inflammatory cytokines. PCM decreases ATP production and increases ROS production in T cells by inhibiting complex III of the electron transport chain. We further show that SHP1 as the key molecule that is upregulated in T cells in response to PCM, inhibition of which reverses the phenotype induced by PCM. Using metabolomics analysis, we identified 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) as a vital molecule that is released by PCC. P5C is responsible for suppressing T cells signaling by increasing ROS and SHP1, and decreasing cytokines and ATP production. We confirmed these findings in vivo, which revealed changed proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) expression in tumor tissues, which in turn influences tumor growth and T cell infiltration.  Conclusions:   Our study uncovered a key immunosuppressive axis, which is triggered by PRODH upregulation in PCa tissues, P5C secretion in media and subsequent SHP1-mediated impairment of T cell signaling and infiltration in PCa.""","""['Yutao Yan', 'Lei Chang', 'Hongzhe Tian', 'Lu Wang', 'Yawei Zhang', 'Tao Yang', 'Guohao Li', 'Weifeng Hu', 'Kavita Shah', 'Gang Chen', 'Yonglian Guo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['PD-1 and BTLA regulate T cell signaling differentially and only partially through SHP1 and SHP2.', 'Ornithine-delta-aminotransferase and proline dehydrogenase genes play a role in non-host disease resistance by regulating pyrroline-5-carboxylate metabolism-induced hypersensitive response.', 'Context of action of proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) in the Hypersensitive Response of Arabidopsis.', 'Proline dehydrogenase (oxidase) in cancer.', 'Metabolic Reprogramming and Reactive Oxygen Species in T Cell Immunity.', 'Metabolic Interventions in Tumor Immunity: Focus on Dual Pathway Inhibitors.', 'Reprogramming T-Cell Metabolism for Better Anti-Tumor Immunity.', 'Dual contribution of the mTOR pathway and of the metabolism of amino acids in prostate cancer.', 'The expression of Hexokinase 2 and its hub genes are correlated with the prognosis in glioma.', 'Reprogramming of glutamine metabolism and its impact on immune response in the tumor microenvironment.']"""

However, it is unknown if they additionally coregulate their transcript diversities. We studied the reliability, consistency and functional associations of co-splicing correlations of genes of interest, across two independent studies, multiple tissues and two statistical methods. We thoroughly investigated the reproducibility of co-splicing correlations of APP, the candidate gene of Azheimer's disease (AD). We then studied how co-splicing correlations in different tissues contributed to predict functional interactions of three other genes and finally computed co-splicing frequency for 17 thousand genes across 52 human tissues.  Results:   We replicated co-splicing correlations between APP and 5 AD-related genes and reproduced expected enrichment of APP co-splicing in synaptic vesicle cycle and proteosome pathways. We observed novel associations for tissue vulnerability to disease with enrichment in APP co-splicing, co-expression and epistasis in AD. APP co-splicing was the strongest predictor and replicated between studies. We confirmed known gene interactions of PRPF8 and GRIA1 in testis and brain cortex, and observed a novel interaction of FGFR2, in breast and prostate, modulated by cancer risk-variants. We produced a co-splicing map across 52 human tissues to help predict the function of over 17 thousand genes.  Conclusions:   We show that coregulation of transcript diversities provides novel biological insights in gene physiology and helps to interpret GWAS results. Co-splicing correlations are reliable and frequent and should be further pursued to help predict gene function. Our results additionally support current AD interventions aiming at the ubiquitin proteosome pathway but unveil the need to consider transcript diversity in addition to volume to assess treatment response and susceptibility to the disease.""","""['Alejandro Cáceres', 'Juan R González']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Amyloid precursor protein, an androgen-regulated gene, is targeted by RNA-binding protein PSF/SFPQ in neuronal cells.', ""Human Alzheimer's disease gene expression signatures and immune profile in APP mouse models: a discrete transcriptomic view of Aβ plaque pathology."", 'Altered levels and splicing of the amyloid precursor protein in the adult rat hippocampus after treatment with DMSO or retinoic acid.', ""The amyloid peptide precursor in Alzheimer's disease."", 'The human β-amyloid precursor protein: biomolecular and epigenetic aspects.']"""

Another goal was to determine correlation of the intensity of the infiltration with ERG oncoprotein expression as well as with the presence of activat-ing translocation TMPRSS2-ERG.  Materials and methods:   To confirm the translocation, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization. Imunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of ERG oncoprotein and for assesment of the number of CD204+ and CD3+ infiltrat-ing cells. We determined the capability to infiltrate malignant structures accord-ing to differences in infiltration of benign and malignant prostate structures.  Results:   Biometric analysis confirmed that the number of CD204+ macrophages in the malignant structure was significantly higher than in the benign prostatic hyperplasia regardless of the fusion pattern. Increased infiltration by CD3+ cells was only detected in malignant structures of the prostate in a group with normal signal pattern and in a group with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. Expression of ERG positively correlated with CD204+ and CD3+ cells infiltration of malignant structures only in cases where the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was found. In the group with a break in the TMPRSS2 gene, a positive correlation was only found between ERG expression and CD204+ macrophages infiltration. In cases with a normal signal pattern, no correlation was found. In the group with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion we observed significantly more cases with a good capability of CD204+ cells to infiltrate malignant structures, unlike the group with a normal signal pattern, where there were more cases with the weak reactivity of CD204 + cells to infiltrate the malignant structures. The same was observed for CD3+ cells. CD204+ macrophages and CD3+ T-lymphocytes in the group with TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion, infiltrated the malignant prostate structures more intensely, but their effect on malignant transformation may be different.  Conclusions:   The association between the presence of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and the different capability of inflammatory cells to infiltrate malignant structures has not been reported so far. The results confirm the important role of the activated ERG gene, due to TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, in the development of inflammation of the prostate as well as the effect of inflammatory cells on the course of neoplastic process.

Patients were categorized into testosterone nadir groups based on the minimum testosterone measurement during continuous gonadotropic-releasing hormone agonist therapy (<20 ng/dL vs 20-49 ng/dL). Outcomes included PSA response (3-month post-radiation therapy PSA and 2-year PSA nadir; multivariable linear regression) and long-term clinical outcomes (biochemical recurrence, metastasis, and prostate cancer-specific mortality; Fine-Gray competing risk regression).

PET data is reconstructed with iterative algorithms, such as VUEPointHD ViP (VPHD) and VUEPoint HD Sharp IR (SharpIR), the latter with additional resolution recovery. It is expected that the resolution recovery algorithm should render more accurate maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) and functional tumor volumes (FTV) than the ordinary OSEM. Performing quantitative analysis, choice of volume-of-interest delineation algorithm (SUV threshold) may influence FTV. Optimizing PET acquisition time is justified if image quality and quantitation do not deteriorate. The aim of this study is to identify the optimal reconstruction algorithm, SUV threshold and acquisition time for ACE-PET/CT.  Methods:   ACE-PET/CT data acquired with a General Electric Discovery 690 PET/CT from 16 consecutive high-risk prostate cancer patients was reconstructed with VPHD and SharpIR. Forty pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) and 14 prostate glands were delineated with 42% and estimated threshold. SUVmax, SUVmean, FTV and total lesion uptake were measured. Default acquisition time was four minutes per bed position. In a subset of lesions, acquisition times of one, two and four minutes were evaluated. Structural tumor volumes (STV) of the LNs were measured with CT for correlation with functional volumetric parameters. To validate SUV quantification under different conditions with SharpIR 42%, recovery coefficients (RCs) of SUVmean and FTV were calculated from a phantom with 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG)-filled volumes 0.1-9.2cm3 and signal-to-background (S/B) ratios 4.3-15.9.  Results:   With SharpIR, SUVmax and SUVmean were higher and FTV lower compared with VPHD, regardless of threshold method, in both prostates and LNs. Total lesion uptake determined with both threshold methods was lower with SharpIR compared with VPHD with both threshold methods, except in subgroup analysis of prostate targets where estimated threshold returned higher values. Longer acquisition times returned higher FTV for both threshold methods, regardless of reconstruction algorithm. The FTV difference was most pronounced with one minute's acquisition per bed position, which also produced visually the highest noise. SUV parameters were unaffected by varying acquisition times. FTV with SharpIR 42% showed the best correspondence with STV. SharpIR 42% gave higher RCs of SUVmean and FTV with increasing phantom size and S/B-ratio, as expected.  Conclusions:   Delineation with SharpIR 42% seems to provide the most accurate combined information from SUVmax, SUVmean, FTV and total lesion uptake. Acquisition time may be shortened to two minutes per bed position with preserved image quality.""","""['Sara Strandberg', 'Armin Hashemi', 'Jan Axelsson', 'Katrine Riklund']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Performance Characteristics of the Whole-Body Discovery IQ PET/CT System.', 'Evaluation and Optimization of a New PET Reconstruction Algorithm, Bayesian Penalized Likelihood Reconstruction, for Lung Cancer Assessment According to Lesion Size.', 'Intensity threshold based solid tumour segmentation method for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images: A review.', '18F-NaF PET/CT of Obese Patients on a Lutetium-Yttrium Oxyorthosilicate PET/CT System: Patient Dosimetry, Optimization of Injected Activity, and Acquisition Time.']"""

Although tremendous efforts have been achieved to improve the early detection of PC, it is still urgent to find out novel markers and therapeutic targets for PC patients. Homeobox protein MOX-1 (MEOX1) is found to be ectopically expressed in human cancers. This study aims to test the hypothesis that MEOX1 gene silencing might suppress the proliferation and invasion of LNCaP cells in PC.  Materials and methods:   Microarray analysis was conducted to screen PC-related differentially expressed gene. MEOX1 was silenced to detect the relationship between silenced MEOX1 and cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and invasion. Expression of MEOX1, Bcl-2, p53, and Bax in LNCaP cells was determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation, colony formation rate, cell migration, invasion, cell cycle, and apoptosis were detected respectively.  Results:   MEOX1 gene was found to be expressed highly in PC tissues. After MEOX1 was silenced in LNCaP cells, the mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2 decreased while the mRNA and protein expressions of p53 and Bax increased.

This study presents the first human dosimetry of 68Ga-NODAGA-MJ9 in the first five consecutive patients with recurrent prostate cancer included in a dual-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) protocol. Five male patients with biochemical relapse of prostate adenocarcinoma underwent four whole-body time-of-flight PET/CT scans within 2 h after tracer injection. To be used as input in OLINDA/EXM 2.0, time-integrated activity coefficients were derived from manually drawn regions of interest over the following body regions: brain, thyroid, lungs, heart, liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, kidneys, adrenals, red marrow, pancreas, intestines, urinary bladder and whole body. Organ absorbed doses and effective dose (ED) were calculated with OLINDA/EXM 2.0 using the NURBS voxelized phantoms adjusted to the ICRP-89 organ masses and ICRP103 tissue-weighting factors. Additional absorbed dose estimations were performed with OLINDA/EXM 1.1 to be comparable with similar previous publications.  Results:   The body regions receiving the highest absorbed doses were the pancreas, the urinary bladder wall, the small intestine and the kidneys (260, 69.8, 38.8 and 34.8 μGy/MBq respectively). The ED considering a 30-min urinary voiding cycle was 17.6 μSv/MBq in male patients. The increment of voiding time interval produced a significant increase of absorbed doses in bladder, prostate and testes, as well as an increase of ED. ED also increased if calculated with OLINDA/EXM 1.1. These results have been discussed in view of similar publications on bombesin analogues or on other commonly used theranostic peptides.  Conclusions:   The pancreas is the most irradiated organ after the injection of 68Ga-NODAGA-MJ9, followed by the urinary bladder wall, the small intestine and the kidneys. ED is in the same range of other common 68Ga-labelled peptides. Differences with similarly published studies on bombesin analogues exist, and are mainly dependent on the methodology used for absorbed dose calculations.

We examine determinants of changes in meeting the PA guidelines (150 min/week of moderate aerobic PA) before and after a prostate cancer diagnosis.  Methods:   Eight hundred and thirty prostate cancer survivors who participated in a population-based case-control study between 1997 and 2000 in Alberta, Canada, enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Past year activity levels were self-reported at diagnosis (pre-diagnosis measure) and again 2 years post-diagnosis. Determinants were collected by questionnaires and medical chart abstractions. Four PA patterns were created: non-exercisers (fail to meet guidelines pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis), adopters (fail to meet guidelines pre-diagnosis, meet guidelines post-diagnosis), maintainers (meet guidelines pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis) and relapsers (meet guidelines pre-diagnosis, fail to meet guidelines post-diagnosis).  Results:   Multinomial logistic regression analyses identified that being a non-exerciser compared to maintainer was associated with being employed, rural location, high PSA, smoking status, not attending support groups and less than average physical quality of life (QoL). Being a relapser compared to maintainer was associated with rural location and lack of friend support. Finally, being a non-exerciser compared to adopter was associated with urinary incontinence, smoking status and less than average physical and mental QoL.  Conclusions:   Demographic, health and lifestyle variables are associated with changes in meeting PA guidelines from pre-diagnosis to post-diagnosis in prostate cancer survivors.

Data on the expression of miR‑224‑5p in PCa were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress and previous literature, and meta‑analyses with standardized mean difference (SMD) and summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) methods were performed for statistical analyses. The prospective target genes of miR‑224‑5p were collected by overlapping the differentially expressed mRNAs in TCGA and GEO, and target genes predicted by miRWalk2.0. Subsequently, in silico analysis was performed to examine the associated pathways of miR‑224‑5p in PCa. The expression of miR‑224‑5p was markedly lower in PCa; the overall SMD was ‑0.562, and overall sROC area under the curve was 0.80. In addition, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that the prospective target genes of miR‑224‑5p were largely enriched in the amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism signaling pathway, and three genes [UDP‑N‑acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 (UAP1), hexokinase 2 (HK2) and chitinase 1 (CHIT1)] enriched in this pathway showed higher expression (P<0.05). In addition, key genes in the protein‑protein interaction network analysis [DNA topoisomerase 2‑α (TOP2A), ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) and ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2)] exhibited significantly increased expression (P<0.05). The results suggested that the downregulated expression of miR‑224‑5p may be associated with the clinical progression and prognosis of PCa. Furthermore, miR‑224‑5p likely exerts its effects by targeting genes, including UAP1, HK2, CHIT1, TOP2A, ACLY and RRM2.

However, AS may be associated with increased risk of disease progression and metastasis due to delayed therapy. Genomic classifiers, e.g., Decipher, may allow better risk-stratify newly diagnosed prostate cancers for AS.  Methods:   Decipher was initially assessed in a prospective cohort of prostatectomies to explore the correlation with clinically meaningful biologic characteristics and then assessed in diagnostic biopsies from a retrospective multicenter cohort of 266 men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) very low/low and favorable-intermediate risk prostate cancer. Decipher and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) were compared as predictors of adverse pathology (AP) for which there is universal agreement that patients with long life-expectancy are not suitable candidates for AS (primary pattern 4 or 5, advanced local stage [pT3b or greater] or lymph node involvement).  Results:   Decipher from prostatectomies was significantly associated with adverse pathologic features (p-values < 0.001). Decipher from the 266 diagnostic biopsies (64.7% NCCN-very-low/low and 35.3% favorable-intermediate) was an independent predictor of AP (odds ratio 1.29 per 10% increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.61, p-value 0.025) when adjusting for CAPRA. CAPRA area under curve (AUC) was 0.57, (95% CI 0.47-0.68). Adding Decipher to CAPRA increased the AUC to 0.65 (95% CI 0.58-0.70). NPV, which determines the degree of confidence in the absence of AP for patients, was 91% (95% CI 87-94%) and 96% (95% CI 90-99%) for Decipher thresholds of 0.45 and 0.2, respectively. Using a threshold of 0.2, Decipher was a significant predictor of AP when adjusting for CAPRA (p-value 0.016).

Currently available therapies for metastatic prostate cancer are only marginally effective. Therefore, new therapeutic agents are urgently needed to improve patient outcome. Isoalantolactone (IATL), an active sesquiterpene naturally present in many vegetables and medicinal plants, is known to induce cell death and apoptosis in various cancer cell lines. Nevertheless, antitumor mechanisms initiated by IATL in cancer cells have not been fully defined.  Methods:   Cell apoptosis and cellular ROS levels were analyzed by flow cytometry. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to analyze the protein and mRNA levels of indicated molecules, respectively. Nude mice xenograft model was used to test the effects of IATL on prostate cancer cell growth in vivo.  Results:   In this study, we found that IATL dose-dependently inhibited cancer cell growth and induced apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Mechanistically, our data found that IATL induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway and eventually cell apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.

Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3 immunostaining experiments were performed in tumor tissues. LGSP exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on PC3 cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. Treatment with LGSP resulted in a G1 phase cell cycle arrest in PC3 cells, which was further confirmed by decreasing the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK 4 and increasing the expression of the tumor suppressors p21 and p27. Furthermore, activation of cleaved fragments of caspases 3, caspases 9, and PARP indicated that LGSP-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent. Upstream of caspase cascade, LGSP increased the cytochrome c release in cytoplasm. After treatment with LGSP, the Bcl-2/Bax ratio also decreased in PC3 cells.

To the authors' knowledge, no direct comparisons between the different variants of AS protocols have been conducted to date. The authors developed a microsimulation decision model to evaluate which of 3 alternative AS protocols is optimal for men with low-risk prostate cancer, and compared each of these with immediate treatment.  Methods:   Men who were diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer at age 65 years were modeled as having been treated with either immediate therapy or via each of 3 AS protocols. Modeled AS protocols represent those in the literature; a modified AS protocol was included in a sensitivity analysis. Immediate therapy included radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiotherapy, or brachytherapy. Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. Cost-effectiveness analysis and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.  Results:   Immediate therapy produced fewer QALYs than all variants of AS. Of the AS protocols evaluated, biennial biopsy was found to be the only efficient option, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3490 per QALY compared with immediate therapy. It delayed the need for curative therapy by a mean of 56 months, and was found to be preferred in >86.9% of cases in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. A modified version of low-intensity AS dominated all other options.  Conclusions:   For a 65-year-old man with low-risk prostate cancer, AS with biennial biopsy appears to be highly cost-effective compared with common alternatives. An AS protocol using triennial biopsy was found to dominate all other strategies and should be considered for men who are comfortable with a longer period between biopsies. The optimal strategy depends on a patient's tolerance for periodic biopsies and comfort with delaying radical treatment.

Commonly used prostate cancer nomograms include Partin's tables and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) nomograms which were developed in high-volume centres in the United States. We aimed to assess whether these tools are valid for prostate cancer patients in Far North Queensland.  Methods:   All patients undergoing radical prostatectomy in Cairns between August 2014 and September 2017 were identified. Preoperative data were entered into the online nomogram tools. The predicted probability of organ-confined (OC) disease, extra-prostatic extension (EPE) and seminal vesical invasion was compared to the observed outcomes.  Results:   Preoperative clinical information was available for 290 patients. Partin's tables accurately estimated OC disease, EPE and seminal vesical invasion with the observed outcome plot overlying the ideal correlation curve. More patients in our cohort had OC disease than was predicted by the MSKCC nomogram; fewer patients had EPE that was predicted by the MSKCC nomogram. On logistic regression modelling, the area under the curve for MSKCC and Partin's were 0.751 and 0.706, respectively, suggesting both tests have good performance in predicting final pathological outcome for our population of patients with no statistical difference between the two nomograms (P = 0.29).  Conclusion:   The MSKCC preoperative nomogram and Partin's tables were both able to accurately predict pathological outcomes from preoperative clinical information in men from Far North Queensland, despite likely differences in population genetics and environmental exposures.""","""['Alexander L Nesbitt', 'Jada Kapoor', 'Charlotte Piesse', 'Garrath Evans', 'Stefan Antoniou', 'Philip Smith', 'Simon W Pridgeon']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""ANZ J Surg""","""['Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Provides Limited Incremental Value Over the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Preradical Prostatectomy Nomogram.', 'One-Stop-Shop Whole-Body 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI Compared with Clinical Nomograms for Preoperative T and N Staging of High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'External Validation of a Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Nomogram for the Prediction of Extracapsular Extension and Seminal Vesicle Invasion in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity.', 'Current validity of nomograms for prostate cancer staging.', 'C-reactive protein and its ratio are useful indicators to exclude anastomotic leakage requiring intervention after laparoscopic rectal surgery.', ""The trend of C-Reactive protein allows a safe early discharge after surgery for Crohn's disease.""]"""

The majority of the PCa-associated HOXB13 mutations identified are localized to two conserved domains in HOXB13 that have been shown to mediate the interaction with MEIS cofactors belonging to the TALE family of homeodomain transcription factors. In this study, we sought to interrogate the biochemical and functional interactions between HOXB13 and MEIS in prostatic cells with a goal of defining how the HOXB13-MEIS complex impacts PCa pathobiology and define the extent to which the oncogenic activity of G84E is related to its effect on HOXB13-MEIS interaction/function.  Methods:   HOXB13 and MEIS paralog expression in prostate epithelial cells and PCa cell lines was characterized by qPCR and immunoblot analyses. HOXB13 and MEIS1 co-expression in human prostate tissue was confirmed by IHC, followed by co-IP mapping of HOXB13-MEIS1 interactions. Proliferation of the PCa cell line LAPC4 following shRNA-mediated knockdown of each gene or both genes was assessed using DNA- and metabolic-based assays. Transcriptional targets of HOXB13 and MEIS1 were identified by gene expression profiling and qPCR. Finally, protein stability of HOXB13 in the context of MEIS1 was determined using pulse-chase assays.  Results:   HOXB13 and MEIS1 are co-expressed and interact in prostate cells. Both of the putative MEIS interacting domains (MID) within HOXB13 were shown to be capable of mediating the interaction between HOXB13 and MEIS1 independently and such interactions were not influenced by the G84E mutation. The inhibitory effect of either HOXB13 or MEIS1 knockdown on cellular proliferation was augmented by knockdown of both genes, and MEIS1 knockdown abolished HOXB13-driven regulation of BCHE and TNFSF10 mRNA expression. Notably, we demonstrated that MEIS1 stabilized the HOXB13 protein in LAPC4 cells.  Conclusions:   Our study provides evidence for functional HOXB13-MEIS1 interactions in PCa. MEIS1 may contribute to the cancer-promoting actions of HOXB13 in cellular proliferation and gene regulation by prolonging HOXB13 half-life. Our data demonstrates that G84E is not a loss-of-function mutation that interferes with HOXB13 stability or ability to interact with MEIS1.""","""['Dorhyun Johng', 'Gonzalo Torga', 'Charles M Ewing', 'Kideok Jin', 'John D Norris', 'Donald P McDonnell', 'William B Isaacs']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['MEIS-mediated suppression of human prostate cancer growth and metastasis through HOXB13-dependent regulation of proteoglycans.', 'MEIS1 and MEIS2 Expression and Prostate Cancer Progression: A Role For HOXB13 Binding Partners in Metastatic Disease.', 'MEIS1 down-regulation by MYC mediates prostate cancer development through elevated HOXB13 expression and AR activity.', 'The role of the MEIS homeobox genes in neuroblastoma.', 'MEIS1 and its potential as a cancer therapeutic target (Review).', 'A Systematic Pan-Cancer Analysis of MEIS1 in Human Tumors as Prognostic Biomarker and Immunotherapy Target.', 'ERN1 dependent impact of glucose and glutamine deprivations on PBX3, PBXIP1, PAX6, MEIS1, and MEIS2 genes expression in U87 glioma cells.', 'Heat Shock Protein 70 and 90 Family in Prostate Cancer.', 'Fine-mapping and identification of candidate causal genes for tail length in the Merinolandschaf breed.', 'HOXB13 suppresses de novo lipogenesis through HDAC3-mediated epigenetic reprogramming in prostate cancer.']"""

Materials/methods:   We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of 160 consecutive non-metastatic NPC patients who received IMRT with or without CHT. Forty-nine out of 160 patients that underwent whole body 18F-FDG PET/CT at our institution for disease staging with a minimum follow-up to 12 months were included in this study. We evaluated the relationship between maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean, respectively), metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of primary tumor and cervical lymph nodes with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). We also investigated the prognostic role of clinical variables such as age, disease stage, plasma EBV DNA load (copies/ml), gross tumor volume of primary tumor and lymph nodes.  Results:   Median follow-up was 55 months. Two- and 5-year OS were 95.8% and 90.5%, respectively, while DFS was 83.4% at both time points. SUVmax of primary tumor ≥ 18.8 g/ml and primary tumor TLG ≥ 203.1 g were significant prognostic factors of worse OS. Furthermore, stages IVB and EBV DNA load ≥ 3493 copies/ml were significantly associated with lower DFS. No correlation was found between PET parameters and plasma EBV DNA load.

Methods:   The first 210 consecutive fusion biopsies were analyzed following installation of the software-based biopsy platform Artemis™ (Eigen, USA). The impact of training was measured in terms of changes in prostate cancer detection rates and biopsy duration over time. We sought to identify a threshold of experience for urologists, which predicts higher detection rates of targeted biopsies. The influence of various factors on prostate cancer detection rates was evaluated using bi- and multivariate analysis.  Results:   Twenty-two urologists (n = 9 senior urologists, n = 13 urological residents) performed targeted biopsies followed by systematic 12-core biopsies. Overall, targeted biopsies yielded a positive result in 39.6% of 260 suspicious MRI lesions. A subgroup analysis of the six urologists who performed more than ten biopsies was then conducted, and their level of experience (i.e., performance of more than eight biopsies) was found to be associated with higher detection rates than those with less experience (49.0% and 23.0%, respectively; p < 0.001) in the targeted biopsies. Experience was likewise a significant and independent predictor of a cancer-positive targeted biopsy (p = 0.002). Experienced senior physicians did not outperform residents in their targeted biopsy results. Further, biopsy duration correlated negatively (r = - 0.5931, p < 0.001) with the total number of biopsies performed for all subgroups during the period of assessment.  Conclusions:   Experience is an important predictor of the rate of detection in targeted biopsies using software-based biopsy platforms with semi-robotic assistance. Moreover, the performance of just a few procedures appears sufficient to increase biopsy effectiveness significantly.

Objective:   To analyze clinicopathological characteristics of UCBD and to compare outcome after radical cystectomy (RC) and partial cystectomy (PC).  Design, setting, and participants:   Data of 115 UCBD patients treated with RC (n=81) or PC (n=34) between 2000 and 2016 were collected from 11 institutional databases and were analyzed retrospectively. Median follow-up was 5.0yr (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.0-6.2).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Upstaging of tumor stage at diagnostic transurethral resection (TUR) to the RC/PC specimen was investigated. Overall survival (OS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) after RC and PC were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and compared using the log-rank test. Intravesical recurrences after PC were reported. A multivariable Cox proportional-hazard model was used to identify factors associated with OS.  Results and limitations:   There were no statistically significant differences in clinicopathological characteristics between RC and PC groups. Fifty-five percent of patients with cTa/is/1 at diagnostic TUR had ≥pT2 tumors at RC/PC. Five-year OS and MFS were, respectively, 62% and 66% for RC and 66% and 55% for PC (p=0.9 and p=0.6). Intravesical tumor recurrence was seen in six of 34 (18%) PC patients. In multivariable analysis, positive surgical margins and extravesical disease (≥pT2) were associated with worse OS, whereas treatment modality was not (RC: reference; PC: hazard ratio 0.94, [95% CI: 0.47-1.90], p=0.9).  Conclusions:   Upstaging of UCBD was frequent, indicating an inaccuracy in clinical staging. We found no differences in OS or MFS between PC and RC groups; therefore, PC may represent a feasible surgical alternative to RC in selected UCBD patients.

Diagnosis:   In addition to prostate cancer, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate revealed that a cystic mass was located at right pelvic cavity. Histopathological examination diagnosed the pelvic cystic mass as metastasis from prostatic cancer.

Importantly, cancers in urinary bladder prior to PCa had a most adverse impact on all-cause (HR = 5.00, P < .001) and cancer-specific death risk (HR = 10.45, P < .001). Time between the pre-existing cancer and PCa had a dose-dependent effect on survival of PCa patients, with a decreased death risk as the increase of the interval time.Pre-existing cancer has a negative impact on the prognosis of patients with PCa, which is most evident in the presence of a pre-existing urinary bladder cancer. Our results provide epidemiologic evidence with low between-group bias, large sample size, and long-term follow-up, highlighting the need for site-, and interval-time-based clinical management for patients with PCa who had a pre-existing cancer.""","""['Yuan Zhou', 'Han Guan', 'Yong Fu', 'Likai Mao', 'Jiyue Ge', 'Lutan Liu', 'Lei Cheng', 'Chao Guan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['The impact of previous cancer on overall survival of bladder cancer patients and the establishment of nomogram for overall survival prediction.', 'Does muscle invasive bladder cancer following pelvic radiotherapy portend worse prognosis?

Salvage whole pelvis radiation therapy as considered in the BLINDED trial is an attractive option, but there are concerns about its toxicity. This article describes early toxicity with the technique.  Methods and materials:   BLINDED was a prospective multicenter phase 2 trial investigating high-dose salvage pelvic irradiation with an additional dose to the fluorocholine-based positron emission tomography-positive pelvic lymph nodes, combined with 6-month androgen blockade. The prescribed dose was 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions with up to 66 Gy in 2.2 Gy fractions to the pathologic pelvic lymph nodes. Early toxicity was defined as toxicity until 1 year after radiation therapy. Patients quality of life was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25).  Results:   Seventy-four patients were recruited in 15 French radiation oncology departments between August 2014 and July 2016. Seven were excluded before treatment because of violation of the inclusion criteria. The intention-to-treat analysis therefore included 67 patients. Half had received prior prostatic irradiation. Median age was 67.7 ± 6.5 years. Grade 2 acute urinary toxicity was observed in 9 of 67 patients (13.4%), and grade 2 1-year toxicity occurred in 4 of 67 patients (6%). Three patients (4.4%) had grade 3 urinary toxicity. Grade 2 acute digestive toxicity was observed in 10 of 67 patients (14.9%), and grade 2 1-year toxicity occurred in 4 of 67 patients (6%). Patients with prior prostate bed irradiation did not exhibit increased urinary or digestive toxicity. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire scores at 1 year did not worsen significantly.  Conclusions:   The acute and 1-year toxicity of the BLINDED protocol was satisfactory, even in patients with a history of prostatic irradiation.""","""['Loig Vaugier', 'Clément Palpacuer', 'Emmanuel Rio', 'Aurore Goineau', 'David Pasquier', 'Xavier Buthaud', 'Guy De Laroche', 'Véronique Beckendorf', 'Paul Sargos', 'Gilles Créhange', 'Pascal Pommier', 'Geneviève Loos', 'Ali Hasbini', 'Igor Latorzeff', 'Marlon Silva', 'Fabrice Denis', 'Jean-Léon Lagrange', 'Loic Campion', 'Stéphane Supiot']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['OLIGOPELVIS GETUG P07, a Multicenter Phase II Trial of Combined High-dose Salvage Radiotherapy and Hormone Therapy in Oligorecurrent Pelvic Node Relapses in Prostate Cancer.', 'OLIGOPELVIS - GETUG P07: a multicentre phase II trial of combined salvage radiotherapy and hormone therapy in oligometastatic pelvic node relapses of prostate cancer.', 'Phase I trial of pelvic nodal dose escalation with hypofractionated IMRT for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Definition of lymph node areas for radiotherapy of prostate cancer: A critical literature review by the French Genito-Urinary Group and the French Association of Urology (GETUG-AFU).', 'Salvage Involved-Field and Extended-Field Radiation Therapy in Positron Emission Tomography-Positive Nodal Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Outcomes and Patterns of Failure.', 'Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer after Primary Treatment with Curative Intent-Impact of Delayed Imaging.', 'Oligometastatic prostate cancer: is it worth targeting the tip of the iceberg?', 'Drug Intensification in Future Postoperative Radiotherapy Practice in Biochemically-Relapsing Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Should androgen deprivation therapy and other systemic treatments be used in men with prostate cancer and a rising PSA post-local treatments?']"""

Here we report a novel function of RARRES1 in metabolic reprogramming of epithelial cells. Using non-targeted LC-MS, we discovered that RARRES1 depletion in epithelial cells caused a global increase in lipid synthesis. RARRES1-depleted cells rewire glucose metabolism by switching from aerobic glycolysis to glucose-dependent de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Treatment with fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor, C75, reversed the effects of RARRES1 depletion. The increased DNL in RARRES1-depleted normal breast and prostate epithelial cells proved advantageous to the cells during starvation, as the increase in fatty acid availability lead to more oxidized fatty acids (FAO), which were used for mitochondrial respiration. Expression of RARRES1 in several common solid tumors is also contextually correlated with expression of fatty acid metabolism genes and fatty acid-regulated transcription factors. Pathway enrichment analysis led us to determine that RARRES1 is regulated by peroxisome proliferating activated receptor (PPAR) signaling. These findings open up a new avenue for metabolic reprogramming and identify RARRES1 as a potential target for cancers and other diseases with impaired fatty acid metabolism.""","""['Sara Maimouni', 'Naiem Issa', 'Selina Cheng', 'Chokri Ouaari', 'Amrita Cheema', 'Deepak Kumar', 'Stephen Byers']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Breast cancer subtype dictates DNA methylation and ALDH1A3-mediated expression of tumor suppressor RARRES1.', 'The Role of Mitochondrial Fat Oxidation in Cancer Cell Proliferation and Survival.', 'CYP4F3B expression is associated with differentiation of HepaRG human hepatocytes and unaffected by fatty acid overload.', 'Hepatic lipid accumulation: cause and consequence of dysregulated glucoregulatory hormones.', 'Crosstalk between osteoprotegerin (OPG), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and, cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) in breast cancer: implications in carcinogenesis.', 'Nutritional Metabolomics in Diet-Breast Cancer Relations: Current Research, Challenges, and Future Directions-A Review.', 'Single-Cell RNA Sequencing: Opportunities and Challenges for Studies on Corneal Biology in Health and Disease.', 'A temporal single cell transcriptome atlas of zebrafish anterior segment development.', 'Endogenous Retrovirus RNA Expression Differences between Race, Stage and HPV Status Offer Improved Prognostication among Women with Cervical Cancer.', 'Characterization of RARRES1 Expression on Circulating Tumor Cells as Unfavorable Prognostic Marker in Resected Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Patients.']"""

We investigated the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on serum urate levels.  Methods:   We retrospectively enrolled a total of 489 prostate cancer patients with available serum urate levels at baseline and 3 and 6 months after ADT (n = 150) or prostate surgery (n = 339). We extracted the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from a data warehouse and compared the changes in urate levels between the two treatment groups and between the different ADT regimens (with versus without luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists) using generalized estimating equation (GEE).  Results:   The baseline urate levels and the proportion of hyperuricemic subjects were comparable between the two groups. After 6 months, the urate levels were significantly decreased (by -0.66 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.81 to -0.51]) in the ADT group, whereas they did not significantly change in the surgery group in the univariate GEE analysis. The ADT group (4.7% from 18.0% at baseline) had a significantly lower proportion of hyperuricemic patients than surgery group (16.5% from 15.9% at baseline) at 6-month (p < 0.001). Regardless of whether LHRH agonists were used, the serial urate levels were lowered by the ADT. Temporal changes in the urate levels were significantly associated with the treatment group, baseline hyperuricemia, and poor functional or advanced cancer status. The ADT-related serum urate level reduction also remained significant in the multivariate GEE analysis (regression coefficient = -0.43 [-0.67 to -0.19] after 3 months and -0.37 [-0.64 to -0.10] after 6 months). Moreover, propensity-score-matched analyses yielded the same results.  Conclusions:   Our results showed that longitudinal serum urate levels were significantly reduced in men receiving ADT. This finding suggests that androgen could have an independent role in urate homeostasis.""","""['Jun Won Park', 'Jae Hyun Lee', 'Hyon Joung Cho', 'You-Jung Ha', 'Eun Ha Kang', 'Kichul Shin', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Eun Young Lee', 'Yeong Wook Song', 'Yun Jong Lee']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Insulin-like growth factor-1 is associated with regulation of the luteinizing hormone production in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for localized prostate cancer.', 'Study of testosterone-guided androgen deprivation therapy in management of prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients with advanced prostate cancer: association between Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and prior ADT exposure with duration of ADT effect.', 'Traditional androgen ablation approaches to advanced prostate cancer: new insights.', 'Quantifying observational evidence for risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Hyperuricemia is accompanied by elevated peripheral CD4+ T cells.', 'The Association Between Spicy Food Intake and Risk of Hyperuricemia Among Chinese Adults.']"""

It has been hypothesized that SNPs in microRNA binding sites may disrupt gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs), short non-coding RNAs that bind to mRNA and downregulate the target gene. While several studies have predicted the location of SNPs in miRNA binding sites, to date there has been no comprehensive analysis of their impact on miRNA regulation. Here we investigate the functional properties of genetic variants and their effects on miRNA regulation of gene expression in cancer. Our analysis is motivated by the hypothesis that distinct alleles may cause differential binding (from miRNAs to mRNAs or from transcription factors to DNA) and change the expression of genes. We previously identified pathways-systems of genes conferring specific cell functions-that are dysregulated by miRNAs in cancer, by comparing miRNA-pathway associations between healthy and tumor tissue. We draw on these results as a starting point to assess whether SNPs on dysregulated pathways are responsible for miRNA dysregulation of individual genes in tumors. Using an integrative regression analysis that incorporates miRNA expression, mRNA expression, and SNP genotype data, we identify functional SNPs that we term ""regulatory QTLs (regQTLs)"": loci whose alleles impact the regulation of genes by miRNAs.

However, translation of these potentially promising agents into clinics has usually failed, partly because of tumor heterogeneity. In this study, anticancer activities of the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 and the Akt-inhibitor erufosine (ErPC3) alone and in combination were compared between CRPC (PC-3 and DU-145) and healthy (PNT-1A) cell lines. The combination of ABT-737 and ErPC3 showed synergistic antiproliferative, antimigratory, and apoptotic effects in PC-3 cells. In DU-145 cells, ErPC3 showed a resistant profile, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values more than two-fold of PC-3, and combining ErPC3 with ABT-737 yielded no added benefit for all the incubation periods compared with ErPC3 alone. In PNT-1A cells, ABT-737 and ErPC3 alone and in combination reduced cell survival slightly and only at the highest concentrations. Apoptosis analysis showed that ABT-737 induced increased Akt expression and ErPC3 induced increased Mcl-1 expression in DU-145 cells. In conclusion, the ABT-737 and ErPC3 combination seems to be promising against CRPC, with a favorable safety profile in healthy cells.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to study the association between each definition and the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR). We also tested the prognostic value of multivariate models including established predictors and each of the studied definitions of GS at a PSM. GS 3+3 was seen at a PSM in 57.4% of the cases and was more common in patients with lower overall GS. Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years 89 patients (35.5%) developed BCR. All of the definitions of GS at a PSM were independent predictors of the BCR-free survival. Most of them also improved the prognostic value of the multivariate models when added to the established parameters. The degree of improvement was similar for the most complex definition (full GS at a PSM) and the easiest to record binary definition (presence of Gleason 4/5 pattern at a PSM). We conclude that compared with the other possible options of reporting GS at a PSM, the presence of Gleason 4/5 pattern may be the most practical definition.

Primary objective was the incidence of chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia (FN), and neutropenia-associated complications. Methods: NADIR was a prospective NIS conducted in 201 study centers in Germany. Results: The analysis included 2489 patients. Main tumor types were breast cancer (n = 1198, 48.1%), lung cancer (n = 303, 12.2%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; n = 337, 13.5%), and prostate cancer (n = 111, 4.5%). Nine hundred and ten (36.6%) patients were aged ≥65 years (regarded as ""elderly"" patients). Severe neutropenia (CTCAE grade 3/4) was reported in 26.8% (n = 666) and 25.2% (n = 229) of the total population and elderly patients, respectively. FN was documented in 2.7% (n = 68) of the total population vs 3.0% (n = 27) of elderly patients. Primary prophylaxis with lipegfilgrastim among patients with high risk of FN (>20%) was documented in 83.5% of the total population and 75.1% of elderly patients.

To resorb bone, osteoclasts release acid and lysosome acid hydrolase via membrane transport. Prostate transmembrane protein androgen induced 1 (Pmepa1) is a type I transmembrane protein that regulates proliferation, migration, and metastasis of cancer cells. Because recent reports showed that Pmepa1 is involved in membrane transport in cancer cells, we investigated the role of Pmepa1 in osteoclast function. Pmepa1 expression was barely detected in osteoclasts formed on plastic surfaces in vitro, but was markedly increased in activated osteoclasts formed on calcified matrix. Inhibitors of bone resorption, such as alendronate, bafilomycin A1, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, suppressed the expression of Pmepa1 in osteoclasts. Knockdown of Pmepa1 expression impaired bone resorption activity and inhibited formation of a ring-like, actin-rich podosome belt that is essential for osteoclast function. Pmepa1 protein localized to lysosomes in osteoclasts.

Some have published pyrazolines from different chalcone derivatives in the literature.  Objective:   A series of new pyrazolines containing novel 2,5-dichloro-3-acetylthiophene chalcone moiety (PZT1-PZT20) have been synthesized, characterized by 1HNMR and 13CNMR and evaluated for them in vitro antitubercular activity against M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain and in vitro anticancer activity against DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines and all compounds were also screened for molecular docking studies against specific targeted protein domains.  Methods:   All compounds were screened for potential activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) strain and anticancer activity against DU-149 prostate cancer cell lines using MTT cytotoxicity assay.  Results:   Among the series, compound PZT5 with 2"", 4""-dichlorophenyl group at 5-position on the pyrazoline ring exhibited the most potent antitubercular activity (MIC=1.60 µg/mL) and compounds PZT2, PZT9, PZT11, PZT15, and PZT20 showed similar antitubercular activity against standard pyrazinamide (MIC=3.12 µg/mL) by broth dilution assay. PZT15 and PZT17 with 4""- pyridinyl and 2""-pyrrolyl groups on pyrazoline ring were found to exhibit better anticancer activity against DU-149 prostate cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 2.0±0.2 µg/mL and 6.0±0.3 µg/mL respectively by MTT assay. The preliminary structure-activity relationship has been summarized. The molecular docking studies with crystalline structures of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase InhA interaction with target protein (2NSD; PDB and 3FNG; PDB) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MTB) strain have also exhibited good ligand interaction and binding affinity. Ligand interaction and binding affinity were estimated using crystal structures of both types of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase InhA (3FNG.pdb) and found to be much higher (-16.70 to - 19.20 kcal/mol) compared with pyrazinamide (-10.70 kcal/mol) as a standard target molecule. Whereas the binding affinities of six active compounds with crystal structure of other type of enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase InhA (2NSD.pdb) were much similar and higher (-9.30 to - 11.20 kcal/mole) than pyrazinamide (-11.10 kcal/mole).

During the course of treatment patients may experience normal tissue reactions. It is a well established fact that genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, such as microRNA (miRNA) level changes might be associated with radiotoxicity, as a response to irradiation.  Materials and methods:   This is the first study that has investigated levels of radiosensory miRNAs in association with acute genitourinary radiotoxicity extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBCs), in three points; before RT (BRT), after RT (ART) and on the first control examination (FCONT). We measured levels of miR-21/146a/155 expression by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), comparative ΔΔCt method, in fifteen patients with localized prostate cancer, treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). Nine subjects have experienced acute genitourinary (GU) radiotoxicity whereas six where without GU radiotoxicity.  Results:   Firstly, we detected the highest levels of miR-21 in ART group (p = 0.043) in the patients with acute GU radiotoxicity. Secondly, we found trend towards higher miR-21 levels and significantly higher levels of miR-146a/155 within the patients with acute GU toxicity than in patients without (p = 0.068, p = 0.016, and p = 0.010, respectively). Thirdly, we detected significant change in miR-146a/155 levels within the patients without acute GU radiotoxicity during RT p = 0.042, and p = 0.041, respectively).

However, it is an immunogenic disease, and the presence of intratumoral T cells is a major prognostic factor for survival. We used a synthetic consensus (SynCon) approach to generate a novel DNA vaccine that breaks immune tolerance to follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), present in 50% of ovarian cancers but confined to the ovary in healthy tissues. SynCon FSHR DNA vaccine generated robust CD8+ and CD4+ cellular immune responses and FSHR-redirected antibodies. The SynCon FSHR DNA vaccine delayed the progression of a highly aggressive ovarian cancer model with peritoneal carcinomatosis in immunocompetent mice, and it increased the infiltration of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Anti-tumor activity of this FSHR vaccine was confirmed in a syngeneic murine FSHR-expressing prostate cancer model. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of vaccine-primed CD8+ T cells after ex vivo expansion delayed ovarian cancer progression. In conclusion, the SynCon FSHR vaccine was able to break immune tolerance and elicit an effective anti-tumor response associated with an increase in tumor-infiltrating T cells. FSHR DNA vaccination could help current ovarian cancer therapy after first-line treatment of FSHR+ tumors to prevent tumor recurrence.""","""['Alfredo Perales-Puchalt', 'Krzysztof Wojtak', 'Elizabeth K Duperret', 'Xue Yang', 'Anna M Slager', 'Jian Yan', 'Kar Muthumani', 'Luis J Montaner', 'David B Weiner']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Ther""","""['Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Receptor Is Expressed by Most Ovarian Cancer Subtypes and Is a Safe and Effective Immunotherapeutic Target.', 'Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Receptor as a Target in the Redirected T-cell Therapy for Cancer.', 'Alteration of the Tumor Stroma Using a Consensus DNA Vaccine Targeting Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP) Synergizes with Antitumor Vaccine Therapy in Mice.', 'Expression Levels of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Receptor and Implication in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Strategy of Ovarian Cancer.', 'Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Receptor (FSHR): A Promising Tool in Oncology?', 'A mAb against surface-expressed FSHR engineered to engage adaptive immunity for ovarian cancer immunotherapy.', 'Nucleic acid vaccination strategies for ovarian cancer.', 'Nomograms of Combining MRI Multisequences Radiomics and Clinical Factors for Differentiating High-Grade From Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma.', 'DNA immunotherapy targeting BARF1 induces potent anti-tumor responses against Epstein-Barr-virus-associated carcinomas.', 'Development of Siglec-9 Blocking Antibody to Enhance Anti-Tumor Immunity.']"""

Objective:   To examine the association between ADT and OS for Gleason 8 versus Gleason 9-10 PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective cohort study of 20 139 men from the National Cancer Database with localized or locally advanced, Gleason 8-10 PCa who received EBRT. Data were collected from 2004 to 2012.  Intervention:   ADT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the association between ADT and OS.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 9509 (78%) of the 12 160 men with Gleason 8 disease and 6908 (87%) of the 7979 men with Gleason 9-10 disease received ADT. On multivariable analysis, ADT was associated with a significant improvement in OS for Gleason 8 patients (adjusted hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.70-0.87, p<0.001) but not for Gleason 9-10 patients (adjusted hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.84-1.11, p=0.6), with a significant interaction (pinteraction=0.020). A higher Gleason score (8, 9, 10) correlated with an increased adjusted hazard ratio for the association between ADT and OS (pinteraction=0.042). Our study may be limited by the relatively short follow-up (median of 4.0 yr).  Conclusions:   In contrast to the significant survival advantage of ADT for Gleason 8 disease, our results suggest that Gleason 9-10 disease derives less survival benefit from ADT and that a higher Gleason score predicts lesser benefit. Consideration should be given to treatment intensification for Gleason 9-10 patients through enrollment in clinical trials or potentially adding novel antiandrogens or docetaxel, which have shown efficacy in both castration-resistant and castration-sensitive settings.

However, bowel preparation quality has been found to vary according to prior AP surgery type. We examined the relationship of prior AP surgery type with bowel preparation quality in a large-scale retrospective cohort.  Materials and methods:   In the health screening cohort of the National Cancer Center, 12881 participants who underwent screening or surveillance colonoscopy between June 2007 and December 2014 were included. Personal data were collected by reviewing patient medical records. Bowel preparation quality was assessed using the Aronchick scale and was categorized as satisfactory for excellent to good bowel preparation or unsatisfactory for fair to inadequate bowel preparation.  Results:   A total of 1557 (12.1%) participants had a history of AP surgery. The surgery types were colorectal surgery (n=44), gastric/small intestinal surgery (n=125), appendectomy/peritoneum/laparotomy (n=476), cesarean section (n=278), uterus/ovarian surgery (n=317), kidney/bladder/prostate surgery (n=19), or liver/pancreatobiliary surgery (n=96). The proportion of satisfactory bowel preparations was 70.7%. In multivariate analysis, unsatisfactory bowel preparation was related to gastric/small intestinal surgery (odds ratio=1.764, 95% confidence interval=1.230-2.532, p=0.002). However, the other surgery types did not affect bowel preparation quality. Current smoking, diabetes, and high body mass index were risk factors of unacceptable bowel preparation.

In this study cationic liposomes of cabazitaxel (CBX) and silibinin (SIL) were prepared with an aim to kill cancer cells and CSCs for prostate cancer. CBX act as cancer cell inhibitor and SIL as CSC inhibitor. Hyaluronic acid (HA), an endogenous anionic polysaccharide was coated on cationic liposomes for targeting CD44 receptors over expressed on CSCs. Liposomes were prepared by ethanol injection method with particle size below 100 nm and entrapment efficiency of more than 90% at 10% w/w drug loading. Liposomes were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Liposomes were evaluated for their anticancer action in androgen independent human prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and DU-145). HA coated liposomes showed potential cytotoxicity over other groups with low IC50, significantly inhibited cell migration and induced apoptosis. Synergistic cytotoxic effect was also observed with HA coated liposomes that resulted in colony formation inhibition and G2/M phase arrest. Proficient cytotoxicity against CD44+ cells (14.87 ± 0.41% in PC-3 and 33.95 ± 0.68% in DU-145 cells) indicated the efficiency of HA coated liposomes towards CSC targeting. Hence, the outcome of this combinational therapy with CD44 targeting indicates the suitability of HA coated CBX and SIL co-loaded liposomes as a potential approach for eradicating prostate cancer and herein might provide a insight for future studies.""","""['Shaheen Mahira', 'Nagavendra Kommineni', 'Gulam Mohammed Husain', 'Wahid Khan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['CD44 targeted chemotherapy for co-eradication of breast cancer stem cells and cancer cells using polymeric nanoparticles of salinomycin and paclitaxel.', 'Pancreatic cancer stem cell proliferation is strongly inhibited by diethyldithiocarbamate-copper complex loaded into hyaluronic acid decorated liposomes.', 'Redox-sensitive and hyaluronic acid functionalized liposomes for cytoplasmic drug delivery to osteosarcoma in animal models.', 'Anticancer therapeutics: targeting macromolecules and nanocarriers to hyaluronan or CD44, a hyaluronan receptor.', 'Lipid-based nanosystems for CD44 targeting in cancer treatment: recent significant advances, ongoing challenges and unmet needs.', 'Functionalized Lipid Nanocarriers for Simultaneous Delivery of Docetaxel and Tariquidar to Chemoresistant Cancer Cells.', 'Anti-Cancer Stem-Cell-Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Alginate Microsphere Encapsulation of Drug-Loaded Nanoparticles: A Novel Strategy for Intraperitoneal Drug Delivery.', 'A Comprehensive Review on Nutraceuticals: Therapy Support and Formulation Challenges.', 'Emerging nanotechnology-based therapeutics to combat multidrug-resistant cancer.']"""

Men with clinical low-risk disease can receive active surveillance to safely preserve quality of life, provided that the risk of an undetected aggressive cancer can be managed. Thus, prediction of a tumor's metastatic potential, ideally using only a biopsy sample, is critical to choosing appropriate treatment. We previously proposed and verified a metastasis potential score (MPS) based on regions prone to copy number alterations in metastatic prostate cancer; MPS is highly predictive of metastatic potential in primary tumors. We developed a novel, targeted postligation amplification sequencing approach, which we call the next-generation copy number alteration assay, to efficiently interrogate 902 genomic sites that belong to 194 genomic regions used in the MPS calculation. The assay is designed to work with the latest generation of sequencing platforms to produce estimates of copy number alteration events. The assay's technical reproducibility, robustness to low starting genomic material, and accuracy have been verified.

However, the main pitfall of BPH surgery in sexually active men remains ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD), which permanently affects quality of life.  Objective:   To detail a novel technique for marking the intraprostatic urethra through a retrograde injection of indocyanine green to enhance selective dissection of prostatic lobes during urethra-sparing robot-assisted simple prostatectomy (US-RASP) with the use of near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIFI).  Design, setting, and participants:   Between January and September 2017, 12 consecutive male patients, who had BPH, were sexually active, and were motivated to preserve ejaculatory function, underwent US-RASP.  Surgical procedure:   US-RASP with NIFI to enhance the identification and preservation of the prostatic urethra.  Measurements:   Clinical data were prospectively collected in our institutional RASP dataset. Perioperative and functional outcomes of US-RASP were both graded, and assessed according to Clavien grading system and validated questionnaires postoperatively (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS]; Male Sexual Health Questionnaire on EjD [MSHQ-EjD] Short Form) at 3 and 12mo.  Results and limitations:   Median preoperative prostate size was 102cc (interquartile range [IQR] 88-115). Median operative time was 150min (IQR 145-170). Median estimated blood loss was 250 (IQR 200-350). Continuous bladder irrigation was avoided in 83.4% of patients. Median time to catheter removal was 7d (IQR 7-7) with a median hospital stay of 3d (IQR 2-3). At 1-yr follow-up, median IPSS score, International Index of Erectile Function score, and MSHQ-EjD Short Form score were 5 (IQR 4-8), 26 (IQR 26-28), and 12 (IQR 1-14), respectively. Satisfactory anterograde ejaculation was reported in eight patients (66%).  Conclusions:   We described a novel NIFI-guided technique to perform US-RASP. This technique showed promising early functional results, suggesting a significant role of intraprostatic urethral integrity for the preservation of ejaculatory function.

Cooperative loss of two or more TSGs may drive more aggressive disease.  Objective:   To determine clinical outcomes of single and compound TSG alterations across the spectrum of prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Massively parallel targeted sequencing using castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC; localized [L] and metastatic [M1]) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) specimens (n=285). TSG altered (TSG-alt) was any copy number loss or deleterious mutation of one or more TSGs (TP53, PTEN, and RB1).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   For L-CSPC, event-free survival (EFS) and time to CRPC were estimated. For M1-CSPC and M1-CRPC, overall survival (OS) was estimated. Cox regression models assessed the association between cumulative TSG hits (zero hits vs one hit vs two to three hits) and outcomes with multivariable analyses adjusted for clinicopathological factors.  Results and limitations:   TSG variants increased with advanced disease (L-CSPC: 39%; M1-CSPC: 63%, M1-CRPC: 92%). TSG-alt L-CSPC had shorter EFS (median 2.6yr, hazard ratio [HR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-3.13) and time to CRPC (median 9.5mo, HR 3.36, 95% CI 1.01-11.16). Cumulative gene hits led to an incremental risk of relapse (EFS: one gene, HR 1.69, 95% CI 0.99-2.87; two to three genes, HR 2.70, 95% CI 1.43-5.08; both versus zero genes, p=0.004). There was evidence of inferior OS with increasing TSG hits in the metastatic cohorts. Only four (8%) patients in the M1-CRPC cohort were TSG-neg, one of whom died after 5.2yr. Multivariable analyses adjusting for mutational and copy number burden did not demonstrate a significant independent association of increasing gene hits and poorer outcomes.  Conclusions:   Deleterious TSG variants are associated with an increased risk of relapse (L) and death (M1) in CSPC. Poorer outcomes are seen with compound gene hits in both early and advanced disease, and this may in part reflect increasing global genomic instability.  Patient summary:   Men with prostate tumors with compound tumor suppressor gene mutations have poorer outcomes.

Objectives:   We investigated whether occupational exposure to alkylphenolic compounds is associated with breast and prostate cancer.  Methods:   We carried out a population-based case-control study including 1513 incident cases of breast cancer, 1095 of prostate cancer, and 3055 controls, frequency matched by sex, age and region. Occupational exposure to alkylphenolic compounds was estimated using a recently developed job-exposure matrix, which considered different scenarios of exposure and different subtypes of alkylphenolic compounds.  Results:   History of occupational exposure to alkylphenolic compounds was modestly associated with breast cancer (OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.01-1.48).

Such effects among Asian populations remain uncertain. The objective of this study is to investigate the use of aspirin on prevention of different cancers among Chinese users. This population-based study utilized database from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority; adults with aspirin prescription for at least 6 months between 2000 and 2004 were included and followed up until 2013. Aspirin users were age-sex matched with non-aspirin users at a 1:2 ratio. Incidences of cancer were the primary outcome measured by relative risk (RR). A total of 204,170 aspirin users and 408,339 non-aspirin users were included, with the mean age 67.5 years, 7.7 years average duration of aspirin prescription and 80 mg as the median dose of aspirin. Cancer incidences were found in 26,929 (13.2%) aspirin users and 70,755 (17.3%) non-aspirin users. Compared with patients who had not been prescribed aspirin, aspirin usage led to significant reduction of cancers in liver (RR: 0.49), stomach (RR: 0.42), colorectum (RR: 0.71), lung (RR: 0.65), pancreas (RR: 0.54), oesophagus (RR: 0.59) and leukaemia (RR: 0.67). There was no demonstrable reduction of kidney cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer and multiple myeloma in association with the usage of aspirin. Risk of breast cancer was shown to marginally increase (RR: 1.14) with aspirin usage.

Voltage-gated K+ channels (KV) play an important role in regulating cancer cell proliferation and are considered as potential targets for the treatment of cancer. However, there is a paucity of information with regard to the implication of piperine in KV associated anticancer activities on human prostate cancer cells LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Therefore, the primary objective of the present study was to elucidate the anticancer action of piperine that might be mediated via voltage-gated K+ current (IK) blockade.  Patients and methods:   Whole-cell patch clamp was used to record the modulatory effects of piperine on IK expressed in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Moreover, the anticancer activity of piperine was evaluated by MTT assay, flow cytometry and live/dead assay.  Results:   Piperine significantly inhibited IK in a dose-dependent manner with an effective IC50 dose 39.91 µM in LNCaP and 49.45 µM in PC-3 cells. Also, piperine induced a positive shift in the relative activation curve in both cells. Blockade of IK by piperine exerted G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest that led to inhibition of cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.  Conclusions:   We showed that the anticancer effects of piperine are directly correlated with the blockade of IK in LNCaP and PC-3 cells.

Bioinformatics analysis identified complementary binding sites between miR-195 and MAP2K1. This study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-195 on the proliferation, apoptosis and adriamycin (ADM) resistance of prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed targeted regulation between miR-195 and MAP2K1. ADM resistant cell line DU145/ADM and PC-3/ADM were generated for comparing the miR-195 and MAP2K1 expression. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity was quantified. Cultured cells were treated with miR-195 mimic, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used for MAP2K1 expression. Western blot measured MAP2K1, ERK1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) expression, and flow cytometry quantified cell apoptosis, followed by EdU staining for cell proliferation.  Results:   Targeted regulation existed between miR-195 and MAP2K1 mRNA. Drug-resistant cells had lower miR-195 than parental cells, whilst MAP2K1 expression was higher. Under ADM treatment with IC50 concentration, drug resistant cells showed lower apoptosis. The transfection of miR-195 decreased MAP2K1 expression and p-ERK1/2, elevated cell apoptosis and suppressed EdU positive rate or cell proliferation.  Conclusions:   The down-regulation of miR-195 is correlated with ADM resistance of prostate cancer cells.

Background:   Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) expressing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (VEGFR1+ MDSCs) potentially foster metastases by establishing a premetastatic niche. In a preclinical study, VEGFR1+ clustering in lymph nodes (LNs) independently predicted time to biochemical recurrence (TTBR) in localized prostate cancer [1].

Methods:   This is a phase II trial (NCT01832259) of neoadjuvant pazopanib 800 mg versus placebo daily for 4 weeks in high-risk localized prostate cancer. The primary endpoint was a decrease in VEGFR1+ MDSC clustering assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. Secondary endpoints were safety, feasibility, and TTBR.  Results:   Thirty patients were randomized to pazopanib versus placebo, with 15 patients randomized to each arm. Demographic and disease characteristics were similar in both arms. There was no difference in the VEGFR1+ clustering between the treatment arms (p = .345). Neoadjuvant therapy with pazopanib was well tolerated, and surgical complications were similar in both arms.

Methods:   We randomly assigned 695 men with localized prostate cancer to watchful waiting or radical prostatectomy from October 1989 through February 1999 and collected follow-up data through 2017. Cumulative incidence and relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for death from any cause, death from prostate cancer, and metastasis were estimated in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, and numbers of years of life gained were estimated. We evaluated the prognostic value of histopathological measures with a Cox proportional-hazards model.  Results:   By December 31, 2017, a total of 261 of the 347 men in the radical-prostatectomy group and 292 of the 348 men in the watchful-waiting group had died; 71 deaths in the radical-prostatectomy group and 110 in the watchful-waiting group were due to prostate cancer (relative risk, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.74; P<0.001; absolute difference in risk, 11.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.2 to 18.2). The number needed to treat to avert one death from any cause was 8.4. At 23 years, a mean of 2.9 extra years of life were gained with radical prostatectomy. Among the men who underwent radical prostatectomy, extracapsular extension was associated with a risk of death from prostate cancer that was 5 times as high as that among men without extracapsular extension, and a Gleason score higher than 7 was associated with a risk that was 10 times as high as that with a score of 6 or lower (scores range from 2 to 10, with higher scores indicating more aggressive cancer).  Conclusions:   Men with clinically detected, localized prostate cancer and a long life expectancy benefited from radical prostatectomy, with a mean of 2.9 years of life gained.

Incremental NS was performed as follows: Grade 1 NS: intrafascial dissection between the peri-prostatic veins and the pseudocapsule of the prostate; Grade 2 NS: inter-fascial dissection along the peri-venous plane; Grade 3 NS: inter-fascial dissection through the outer compartment of the lateral prostatic fascia; Grade 4 NS: extrafascial dissection.  Results:   Data from 561 patients were considered, and 829 prostatic lobes with biopsy-documented tumour were analysed. Overall, 142 lobes presented ECE that was focal in 27 (19%) cases. The classification tree identified four risk categories. In the low- [P (%) ≤10], intermediate- [P (%) 10-21], high [P (%) 21-73] and very-high-risk [P(%) >73] groups, the ECE rates were 3.3%, 16%, 61.6% and 90%, respectively. Amongst those, ECE was focal in 41.7%, 31.7%, 7.9% and 0%, respectively.  Conclusion:   We suggest that Grade 1 NS (intrafascial) should be performed in the low-risk group. The inter-fascial approach, namely grades 2 and 3 NS, should be performed in the intermediate- and high-risk categories, respectively. Grade 4 NS (extrafascial) should be performed in the very-high-risk group. The current algorithm yields a better accuracy than the previous one; however, prospective validation is warranted.""","""['Alberto Martini', 'Shivaram Cumarasamy', 'Kenneth G Haines III', 'Ashutosh K Tewari']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Development and internal validation of a side-specific, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-based nomogram for the prediction of extracapsular extension of prostate cancer.', 'Safety of selective nerve sparing in high risk prostate cancer during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'MRI Displays the Prostatic Cancer Anatomy and Improves the Bundles Management Before Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Side-specific, Microultrasound-based Nomogram for the Prediction of Extracapsular Extension in Prostate Cancer.', 'Integration of magnetic resonance imaging into prostate cancer nomograms.', 'Assessment of MYC/PTEN Status by Gene-Protein Assay in Grade Group 2 Prostate Biopsies.', 'On the use of the ""Population Attributable Fraction"": application in cost estimation.', 'Changes in risk-group stratification of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy at the Southern Alberta Institute of Urology over time.']"""

Purpose:   To evaluate both intra- and interreader reproducibility of PI-RADSv2 in the assessment of intraprostatic lesions using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population/subjects:   In all, 102 consecutive biopsy-naïve patients who underwent prostate MRI and subsequent MR/transrectal ultrasonography (MR/TRUS)-guided biopsy.  Field strength/sequences:   Prostate mpMRI at 3T using endorectal with phased array surface coils (TW MRI, DW MRI with ADC maps and b2000 DW MRI, DCE MRI).  Assessment:   Previously detected and biopsied lesions were scored by four readers from four different institutions using PI-RADSv2. Readers scored lesions during two readout rounds with a 4-week washout period.  Statistical tests:   Kappa (κ) statistics and specific agreement (Po ) were calculated to quantify intra- and interreader reproducibility of PI-RADSv2 scoring. Lesion measurement agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).  Results:   Overall intrareader reproducibility was moderate to substantial (κ = 0.43-0.67, Po = 0.60-0.77), while overall interreader reproducibility was poor to moderate (κ = 0.24, Po = 46). Readers with more experience showed greater interreader reproducibility than readers with intermediate experience in the whole prostate (P = 0.026) and peripheral zone (P = 0.002). Sequence-specific interreader agreement for all readers was similar to the overall PI-RADSv2 score, with κ = 0.24, 0.24, and 0.23 and Po = 0.47, 0.44, and 0.54 in T2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE), respectively. Overall intrareader and interreader ICC for lesion measurement was 0.82 and 0.71, respectively.  Data conclusion:   PI-RADSv2 provides moderate intrareader reproducibility, poor interreader reproducibility, and moderate interreader lesion measurement reproducibility.

This technique measures the fractional amount of luminal water in prostate tissue, and has shown promising preliminary results in detection of PCa. To include LWI in clinical settings, further investigation on the accuracy of this technique is required. In this study, we compare the diagnostic accuracy of LWI with those of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI in detection and grading of PCa. Fifteen patients with biopsy-proven PCa consented to participate in this ethics-board-approved prospective study. Patients were examined with LWI, DWI, and DCE sequences at 3 T prior to radical prostatectomy. Maps of MRI parameters were generated and registered to whole-mount histology. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of individual and combined MR parameters. Correlation with Gleason score (GS) was evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation test. The results show that area under the ROC curve (AUC) obtained from LWI was equal to or higher than the AUC obtained from DWI, DCE, or their combination, in peripheral zone (0.98 versus 0.90, 0.89, and 0.91 respectively), transition zone (0.99 versus 0.98, n/a, and 0.98), and the entire prostate (0.85 versus 0.81, 0.75, and 0.84). The strongest correlation with GS was achieved from LWI (ρ = -0.81 ± 0.09, P < 0.001). Results of this pilot study show that LWI performs equally well as, or better than, DWI and DCE in detection of PCa. LWI provides significantly higher correlation with GS than DWI and DCE. This technique can potentially be included in clinical MRI protocols to improve characterization of tumors. However, considering the small size of the patient population in this study, a further study with a larger cohort of patients and broader range of GS is required to confirm the findings and draw a firm conclusion on the applicability of LWI in clinical settings.""","""['Shirin Sabouri', 'Silvia D Chang', 'S Larry Goldenberg', 'Richard Savdie', 'Edward C Jones', 'Peter C Black', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Piotr Kozlowski']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['New prostate MRI techniques and sequences.', 'Luminal Water Imaging: Comparison With Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and PI-RADS for Characterization of Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness.', 'Luminal Water Imaging: A New MR Imaging T2 Mapping Technique for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Comparison of T2-Weighted Imaging, DWI, and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Calculation of Prostate Cancer Index Lesion Volume: Correlation With Whole-Mount Pathology.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Joint estimation of relaxation and diffusion tissue parameters for prostate cancer with relaxation-VERDICT MRI.', 'Quantitative myelin imaging with MRI and PET: an overview of techniques and their validation status.', 'The Impact of Dense Breasts on the Stage of Breast Cancer at Diagnosis: A Review and Options for Supplemental Screening.', 'Emerging methods for prostate cancer imaging: evaluating cancer structure and metabolic alterations more clearly.', 'New prostate MRI techniques and sequences.']"""

The degree of luminal versus basal differentiation in cancer has been shown to be biologically important in some carcinomas and impacts treatment response.  Experimental design:   Although prior studies have focused on individual cancer types, we used a modified clinical-grade classifier (PAM50) to subtype 8,764 tumors across 22 different carcinomas into luminal A, luminal B, and basal-like tumors.  Results:   We found that all epithelial tumors demonstrated similar gene expression-based luminal/basal subtypes. As expected, basal-like tumors were associated with increased expression of the basal markers KRT5/6 and KRT14, and luminal-like tumors were associated with increased expression of the luminal markers KRT20. Luminal A tumors consistently had improved outcomes compared with basal across many tumor types, with luminal B tumors falling between the two. Basal tumors had the highest rates of TP53 and RB1 mutations and copy number loss. Luminal breast, cervical, ovarian, and endometrial tumors had increased ESR1 expression, and luminal prostate, breast, cervical, and bladder tumors had increased androgen receptor (AR) expression. Furthermore, luminal B tumors had the highest rates of AR and ESR1 mutations and had increased sensitivity in vitro to bicalutamide and tamoxifen. Luminal B tumors were more sensitive to gemcitabine, and basal tumors were more sensitive to docetaxel.  Conclusions:   This first pan-carcinoma luminal/basal subtyping across epithelial tumors reveals global similarities across carcinomas in the transcriptome, genome, clinical outcomes, and drug sensitivity, emphasizing the biological and translational importance of these luminal versus basal subtypes.""","""['Shuang G Zhao#', 'William S Chen#', 'Rajdeep Das', 'S Laura Chang', 'Scott A Tomlins', 'Jonathan Chou', 'David A Quigley', 'Ha X Dang', 'Travis J Barnard', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'Ewan A Gibb', 'Yang Liu', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Linda R Duska', 'Edwin M Posadas', 'Shruti Jolly', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Christopher A Maher', 'Eric J Small', 'Felix Y Feng']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Targeted DNA and RNA Sequencing of Paired Urothelial and Squamous Bladder Cancers Reveals Discordant Genomic and Transcriptomic Events and Unique Therapeutic Implications.', 'Immune gene expression profiling reveals heterogeneity in luminal breast tumors.', 'Specific micro-RNA expression patterns distinguish the basal and luminal subtypes of muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'p53 in breast cancer subtypes and new insights into response to chemotherapy.', 'Basal-like breast carcinoma: a phenotypically distinct entity.', 'Transcriptomic signature defines two subtypes of locally advanced PCa with distinct neoadjuvant therapy benefits.', 'Identification and verification of an ALYREF-involved 5-methylcytosine based signature for stratification of prostate cancer patients and prediction of clinical outcome and response to therapies.', 'Evaluation of IGF2, KRT14, and KRT20 as Urinary Biomarkers in Patients with Bladder Cancer.', 'The established chemokine-related prognostic gene signature in prostate cancer: Implications for anti-androgen and immunotherapies.', 'Intrinsic Molecular Subtypes of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Objective:   To develop and validate bidirectional crosswalks between the sexual and urinary domains (single domain in MSK, separate incontinence and irritative/obstructive domains in EPIC-26) of the MSK and EPIC-26 instruments.  Design, setting, and participants:   Radical prostatectomy (RP) patients completing instruments at MSK and Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) between January and May of 2017 were invited to enroll. Stratified random sampling (by institution, MSK urinary function score, and MSK erectile function score) was used to divide patient data into training and test sets. Models were developed to predict the domain score for each instrument using the other's item responses and domain scores. Performance was evaluated using capped root-mean-squared error and accuracy at established thresholds.  Results and limitations:   We received 517 instruments at MSK and 1033 within MUSIC, which were assigned to training (825), post-RP test (412), and pre-RP test (313) sets. We found the crosswalks to have low error and high accuracy. Although the crosswalks are more accurate if responses to each item are known, it is possible to convert between instruments on the basis of a total domain score.  Conclusions:   The crosswalks are a valid way to convert between sexual and urinary domains of the MSK and EPIC-26 instruments.  Patient summary:   We developed and validated a set of formulas that allow conversion of sexual and urinary function scores between the Memorial Sloan Kettering and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form patient-reported outcome questionnaires.

Olaratumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds PDGFRα and blocks downstream signalling. This phase II study assessed the efficacy and safety of olaratumab in combination with mitoxantrone and prednisone (M/P) versus M/P alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who progressed after docetaxel.  Methods:   Patients were randomised to receive 21-d cycles of olaratumab (15 mg/kg, Days 1 and 8) plus mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2, Day 1) and prednisone (5 mg, twice daily) or M/P alone. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end-point. Secondary end-points included overall survival (OS), safety, and circulating tumour cell (CTC) counts.  Results:   A total of 123 patients were randomised, 63 to olaratumab + M/P and 60 to M/P. Median PFS was 2.3 months for olaratumab + M/P and 2.4 months for M/P (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87-1.90). Median OS was 14.2 months for olaratumab + M/P and 12.8 months for M/P (HR = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.72-1.61). Both treatment arms had similar toxicity profiles; neutropenia (24% versus 15%), anaemia (13% versus 14%) and fatigue (11% versus 9%) (olaratumab + M/P versus M/P, respectively) were the most common grade ≥3 events. High CTC count was associated with poorer OS in both arms. Patients with very high cell counts (>37 cells/7.5 ml) exhibited improved OS with olaratumab + M/P (interaction P = 0.043).

Interplay between FOXA1 and breast cancer specific signaling pathways has been reported previously, indicating a regulation network on FOXA1 in breast cancer cells. Here in this study, we aimed to identify which are the proteins that could potentially control FOXA1 function in breast cancer cell lines expressing different molecular markers. We first established a luciferase reporter system reflecting FOXA1 binding to DNA. Then, we applied high throughput chemical screening of multiple protein targets and mass spectrometry in breast cancer cell lines expressing different molecular markers: ER positive/HER2 negative (MCF-7), ER positive/HER2 positive (BT474), and ER negative/HER2 positive (MDA-MB-453). Regardless of estrogen receptor status, HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) enriched cell lines showed similar response to kinase inhibitors, indicating the control of FOXA1 by cell signaling kinases. Among these kinases, we identified additional receptor tyrosine kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases as regulators of FOXA1. Furthermore, we performed proteomics experiments from FOXA1 inmunoprecipitated protein complex to identify that FOXA1 interacts with several proteins. Among all the targets, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) as a positive factor to interact with FOXA1 in BT474 cell line. In silico analyses confirmed that cyclin-dependent kinases might be the kinases responsible for FOXA1 phosphorylation at the Forkhead domain and the transactivation domain. These results reveal that FOXA1 is potentially regulated by multiple kinases. The cell cycle control kinase CDK1 might control directly FOXA1 by phosphorylation and other kinases indirectly by means of regulating other proteins.""","""['Shixiong Wang', 'Sachin Kumar Singh', 'Madhumohan R Katika', 'Sandra Lopez-Aviles', 'Antoni Hurtado']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Impact of FOXA1 expression on the prognosis of patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.', 'Impact of GATA-3 and FOXA1 expression in patients with hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer.', 'FOXA1 represses the molecular phenotype of basal breast cancer cells.', 'FOXA1: a transcription factor with parallel functions in development and cancer.', 'FOXA1 as a therapeutic target for breast cancer.', 'Transcription Factors: The Fulcrum Between Cell Development and Carcinogenesis.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'Sex Hormone Receptor Signals in Human Malignancies.']"""

However, it is still a great challenge to fabricate a biocompatible NDDS with simple structure capable of optimizing therapeutic eﬃcacy, such as high tumor accumulation, suitable drug release profile (e.g. no premature drug leakage in normal physiological conditions while having a rapid release in cancer cells), low immunogenicity, as well as good biocompatibility. In this work, a simple core/shell structured nanoparticle was fabricated for prostate cancer treatment, in which a mesoporous silica nanoparticle core was applied as a container to high-efficiently encapsulate drugs (doxorubicin, DOX), CaCO3 interlayer was designed to act as sheddable pH-sensitive gatekeepers for controlling drug release, and cancer cell membrane wrapped outlayer could improve the colloid stability and tumor accumulation capacity. In vitro cell experiments demonstrated that the as-prepared nanovehicles (denoted as DOX/MSN@CaCO3@CM) could be efficiently uptaken by LNCaP-AI prostate cancer cells and even exhibited a better anti-tumor efficiency than free DOX. In addition, Live/Dead cell detection and apoptosis experiment demonstrated that MSN/DOX@CaCO3@CM could effectively induce apoptosis-related death in prostate cancer cells. In vivo antitumor results demonstrated that DOX/MSN@CaCO3@CM administration could remarkably suppress the tumor growth.

We tested the hypothesis that exercise training will mitigate prostate cancer-induced cardiac and skeletal muscle atrophy and improve LV function versus sedentary tumor-bearing counterparts. Copenhagen rats ( n = 39; ~5 mo old) were randomized into four groups: exercise-trained tumor-bearing (EXTB) or control (EXCON) and sedentary tumor-bearing (SEDTB) or control (SEDCON). Dunning R-3327 prostate cancer cells were injected orthotopically in 19 of the 39 animals. Treadmill exercise training was performed for 60 min/day for ~30 days. Animals underwent echocardiography to examine ventricle dimensions ""Pre-"" cancer injection or exercise (PRE) and 15 (Post 1) and 32-35 (Post 2) days after cancer cell injection with tissues collected after Post 2. LV TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations were measured post mortem. Cardiac and LV mass of SEDTB animals were lower than all groups ( P < 0.05). Tumor mass was negatively correlated with LV mass in EXTB (-0.75, P < 0.02) and SEDTB animals (-0.72, P < 0.02). EXCON group had higher stroke volume Post 2 assessment compared with both sedentary groups ( P < 0.05) but not EXTB animals. No difference in LV [IL-6] or [TNF-α] was found between the cancer groups. The current investigation demonstrates prostate cancer, independent of anticancer treatment, significantly reduces cardiac mass and LV mass as well as locomotor muscle masses. However, moderate-intensity exercise training can mitigate cardiac and skeletal muscle atrophy with prostate cancer and preserve the cardiac phenotype (i.e., mass and function) to that of the healthy sedentary group.

Our results demonstrated that PCAT6 was upregulated in colon cancer tissues compared with that in noncancerous tissues, correlating with poorer clinical stages and a worse survival status. In vitro and in vivo experiments illustrated PCAT6 promoted cell growth and inhibited cell apoptosis in colon cancer. Mechanistically, PCAT6 enhanced the coenrichment of EZH2 and H3K4me3 at the apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) genomic region, promoting the transcriptional activity of ARC.

The second aim was to investigate factors associated with overall survival (OS).  Methods:   We retrospectively assessed mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean) and total tumor volumes (TTV) on PSMA PET in 38 of 55 mCRPC patients before and after RLT. PSA testing and PSMA PET/CT(MRI) imaging were performed during the 8 weeks before and the 6 weeks after RLT. PSMA PET and CT(MRI) images were reviewed separately according to the modified PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (mPERCIST) and RECIST1.1. The results were compared with PSA responses. Associations between OS and the RECIST evaluation and changes in SUVmean, TTV, and PSA, CRP, LDH, hemoglobin and ALP levels were determined in a univariable survival analysis.  Results:   The median PSA level at the time of pretherapy PSMA PET/CT(MRI) was 60.8 ng/ml (IQR 15.4, 264.2 ng/ml). After RLT the median PSA level decreased by 44%, TTV by 45.1%, SUVmean by 25.8% and RECIST by 11.3%. A PSA response was seen in 18 patients (47.4%), stable disease in 12 (31.6%) and progressive disease in 8 (21.1%). Contrary to the changes in SUVmean and the RECIST evaluation, the change in TTV was significantly associated with PSA response (p = 0.15, p = 0.58, and p < 0.001, respectively). After a median follow-up of 17 months (IQR 8.0, 24.2 months), 11 patients (28.9%) had died of their prostate cancer. The changes in both TTV and PSA levels were associated with OS (HR 1.001, 95% CI 1-1.003, p = 0.04, and HR 1.004, 95% CI 1.001-1.008, p = 0.01, respectively), while the changes in SUVmean and the RECIST evaluation were not. The pre-therapy CRP level was also associated with OS (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.009-1.14, p = 0.02).  Conclusion:   TTV on PSMA PET seems to be a reliable parameter for response assessment in mCRPC patients undergoing RLT and might overcome the limitations of RECIST in prostate cancer.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful non-invasive imaging tool used for medical diagnosis, but its clinical hardware is incapable of reaching the cellular length scale directly. In spite of this limitation, microscopic tissue changes in pathology can potentially be captured indirectly, from macroscopic imaging characteristics, by studying water diffusion. Here we focus on water diffusion and NMR relaxation in the human prostate, a highly heterogeneous organ at the cellular level. We present a physical picture of water diffusion and NMR relaxation in the prostate tissue, that is comprised of a densely-packed cellular compartment (composed of stroma and epithelium), and a luminal compartment with almost unrestricted water diffusion. Transverse NMR relaxation is used to identify fast and slow T 2 components, corresponding to these tissue compartments, and to disentangle the luminal and cellular compartment contributions to the temporal evolution of the overall water diffusion coefficient. Diffusion in the luminal compartment falls into the short-time surface-to-volume (S/V) limit, indicating that only a small fraction of water molecules has time to encounter the luminal walls of healthy tissue; from the S/V ratio, the average lumen diameter averaged over three young healthy subjects is measured to be 217.7±188.7 μm. Conversely, the diffusion in the cellular compartment is highly restricted and anisotropic, consistent with the fibrous character of the stromal tissue. Diffusion transverse to these fibers is well described by the random permeable barrier model (RPBM), as confirmed by the dynamical exponent ϑ = 1/2 for approaching the long-time limit of diffusion, and the corresponding structural exponent p = -1 in histology. The RPBM-derived fiber diameter and membrane permeability were 19.8±8.1 μm and 0.044±0.045 μm/ms, respectively, in agreement with known values from tissue histology and membrane biophysics. Lastly, we revisited 38 prostate cancer cases from a recently published study, and found the same dynamical exponent ϑ = 1/2 of diffusion in tumors and benign regions. Our results suggest that a multi-parametric MRI acquisition combined with biophysical modeling may be a powerful non-invasive complement to prostate cancer grading, potentially foregoing biopsies.""","""['Gregory Lemberskiy', 'Els Fieremans', 'Jelle Veraart', 'Fang-Ming Deng', 'Andrew B Rosenkrantz', 'Dmitry S Novikov']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Front Phys""","""['Time-dependent diffusion in skeletal muscle with the random permeable barrier model (RPBM): application to normal controls and chronic exertional compartment syndrome patients.', 'Microstructural characterization of normal and malignant human prostate tissue with vascular, extracellular, and restricted diffusion for cytometry in tumours magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Transverse NMR relaxation in biological tissues.', 'In vivo observation and biophysical interpretation of time-dependent diffusion in human cortical gray matter.', 'NMR techniques in studying water in biotechnological systems.', 'Joint estimation of relaxation and diffusion tissue parameters for prostate cancer with relaxation-VERDICT MRI.', 'Diffusion time dependency of extracellular diffusion.', 'Mapping the human connectome using diffusion MRI at 300 mT/m gradient strength: Methodological advances and scientific impact.', 'Diffusion MRI signal cumulants and hepatocyte microstructure at fixed diffusion time: Insights from simulations, 9.4T imaging, and histology.', 'Combined diffusion-relaxometry microstructure imaging: Current status and future prospects.']"""

Unfortunately, there is no cure once the tumor is established within the bone niche. Although osteocytes are master regulators of bone homeostasis and remodeling, their role in supporting PCa metastases remains poorly defined. This is largely due to a lack of suitable ex vivo models capable of recapitulating the physiological behavior of primary osteocytes. To address this need, we integrated an engineered bone tissue model formed by 3D-networked primary human osteocytes, with conditionally reprogrammed (CR) primary human PCa cells. CR PCa cells induced a significant increase in the expression of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) by osteocytes. The expression of the Wnt inhibitors sclerostin and dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1), exhibited contrasting trends, where sclerostin decreased while Dkk-1 increased. Furthermore, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was induced with a concomitant increase in mineralization, consistent with the predominantly osteoblastic PCa-bone metastasis niche seen in patients. Lastly, we confirmed that traditional 2D culture failed to reproduce these key responses, making the use of our ex vivo engineered human 3D bone tissue an ideal platform for modeling PCa-bone interactions.""","""['Saba Choudhary', 'Poornema Ramasundaram', 'Eugenia Dziopa', 'Ciaran Mannion', 'Yair Kissin', 'Lucas Tricoli', 'Christopher Albanese', 'Woo Lee', 'Jenny Zilberberg']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['A 3D in\xa0vitro model of patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft for controlled interrogation of in\xa0vivo tumor-stromal interactions.', 'Prostate cancer cells promote osteoblastic bone metastases through Wnts.', 'Dickkopf-1 expression increases early in prostate cancer development and decreases during progression from primary tumor to metastasis.', 'Osteocytes and Bone Metastasis.', 'Bone, a Secondary Growth Site of Breast and Prostate Carcinomas: Role of Osteocytes.', 'Osteocytes: New Kids on the Block for Cancer in Bone Therapy.', 'The link between bone-derived factors osteocalcin, fibroblast growth factor 23, sclerostin, lipocalin 2 and tumor bone metastasis.', 'Nano-Hydroxyapatite/PLGA Mixed Scaffolds as a Tool for Drug Development and to Study Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the Bone.', 'Translation Potential and Challenges of In Vitro and Murine Models in Cancer Clinic.', 'A Bioreactor for 3D In Vitro Modeling of the Mechanical Stimulation of Osteocytes.']"""

Accordingly, aberrant MET/nMET elevation correlates with ARF in human prostate cancer (PCa) specimens. Mechanistically, ARF elevates nMET through binding to MET cytoplasmic domain to stabilize MET. Furthermore, carbon nanodots resensitize cancer cells to MET inhibitors through DNA damage response. The inhibition of phosphorylation by carbon nanodots was identified through binding to phosphate group of phospho-tyrosine via computational calculation and experimental assay.

Subsequently, plan adaptation was performed with a program developed in-house. This program calculates dose distributions on CBCT images and optimizes field shape to minimize rectal dose while keeping the target at the optimal dose coverage (the planning target volume D95% receives 95% of the prescription dose). To evaluate the adaptive planning approach, we re-calculated dose distributions on CBCT images based on the conventional and adaptive plans. For the entire cohort, plan adaptation improved rectal V50 Gy, V60 Gy, V65 Gy, and V70 Gy by -7.71±8.43%, -8.30±8.90%, -7.91±8.51% and -7.03±7.70% on average (±SD), respectively.

In the context of treatment response assessment, however, one must also consider how sensitive a QIB is to measuring changes in the tumour. This work introduces response-to-repeatability ratio (R/R), which weighs the ability of a QIB to detect significant changes with respect to its measurement repeatability and applies it to the case of PET texture features. R/R is evaluated as the proportion of measurable changes from baseline to follow-up for each candidate QIB. We analyse 47 texture features extracted from lesions in bone-metastatic prostate cancer patients who received double baseline and/or baseline to treatment follow-up 18F-NaF PET/CT scans. R/R evaluates the proportion of follow-up changes outside of the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) defined by test-retest values. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) are calculated for each feature. Relationship between ICC and R/R are evaluated with the Spearman's correlation coefficient. R/R varied significantly across texture features: 41/47 (87%) features demonstrated R/R > 5%; 21/47 (45%) features demonstrated R/R > 10%, and 11/47 (23%) features demonstrated R/R > 20%. LOA of features ranged from [0.998, 1.001] to [0.22, 4.86]. Repeatability alone did not qualify a feature for its efficacy at detecting measurable change at follow-up, as shown by weak correlations between R/R and both CV and ICC (ρ = 0.23 and ρ = 0.40, respectively). Three features demonstrated excellent ICC (ICC > 0.75) and R/R greater than that of SUVmax (R/R = 41.8%): skewness (ICC = 0.92, R/R = 75.4%), kurtosis (ICC = 0.88, R/R = 47.0%) and diagonal moment (ICC = 0.88, R/R = 45.5%).

Their configuration (i.e. determining the algorithm's parameters), however, can be a labour-intensive and time-consuming trial-and-error procedure. Previously, we introduced the reference point method (RPM) for fast automated multi-objective treatment planning. The RPM generates a single Pareto optimal plan for each patient. When the RPM is configured appropriately, this plan has clinically favourable trade-offs between all plan objectives. This paper proposes a new procedure to automatically generate a single configuration of the RPM per tumour site. The procedure was tested for prostate cancer. Planning CT scans of 287 previously treated patients were included in a database, together with corresponding Pareto optimal plans generated using our clinically applied two-phase [Formula: see text]-constraint method (part of Erasmus-iCycle) for automated multi-objective treatment planning. The procedure developed acquires plan characteristics observed in a training set. Based on these, an RPM configuration is automatically generated according to user preferences which specify acceptable differences between training set plans and corresponding RPM generated plans. For example, compared to the training set plans, the RPM generated plans need to have similar PTV coverage, and preferably reduced high rectum dose while slight deteriorations in other objectives are allowed. Training sets of different sizes were tested, and the quality of the resulting RPM configurations was evaluated on the test set (subset of the database not used for training). Using the new procedure, an RPM configuration was generated for each training set. The quality of RPM generated plans was similar or slightly better than that of the corresponding test set plans. The proposed automated configuration procedure greatly reduces the manual configuration workload, and thereby improves the efficiency and effectiveness of an automated clinical treatment planning workflow.""","""['Rens van Haveren', 'Ben J M Heijmen', 'Sebastiaan Breedveld']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Automatic configuration of the reference point method for fully automated multi-objective treatment planning applied to oropharyngeal cancer.', 'Fully automated volumetric modulated arc therapy plan generation for prostate cancer patients.', 'Fully automated, multi-criterial planning for Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy - An international multi-center validation for prostate cancer.', 'Automation in radiotherapy treatment planning: Examples of use in clinical practice and future trends for a complete automated workflow.', 'Automated Radiotherapy Treatment Planning.', 'Dose prediction with deep learning for prostate cancer radiation therapy: Model adaptation to different treatment planning practices.', 'Automatic configuration of the reference point method for fully automated multi-objective treatment planning applied to oropharyngeal cancer.']"""

We use single-cell gene profiling to analyze the molecular heterogeneity in basal and luminal compartments. Within the luminal compartment, we identify a subset of cells intrinsically resistant to castration with a bi-lineage gene expression pattern. We discover LY6D as a marker of CR prostate progenitors with multipotent differentiation and enriched organoid-forming capacity. Lineage tracing further reveals that LY6D+ CR luminal cells can produce LY6D- luminal cells.

This study examined factors associated with self-reported falls and balance/walking difficulty in the past 12 months in older survivors of four major cancers.  Methods:   This was a cross-sectional study analyzing population-based data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS). Data from cohorts 9 to 14 (January 2006 to December 2013) were extracted. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥65 years at cancer diagnosis, first MHOS completed during years 1-5 post-cancer diagnosis, first primary breast (n = 2725), colorectal (n = 1646), lung (n = 752), and prostate (n = 4245) cancer, and availability of cancer staging information. Primary outcomes were self-reported falls and balance/walking difficulty in the past 12 months. Multivariable logistic regression was constructed for each cancer type to examine independent factors associated with falls and balance/walking difficulty.  Results:   In all cancer types, advancing age at cancer diagnosis and dependence in activities of daily living were significant independent factors associated with increased odds of reporting falls and balance/walking difficulty in the past 12 months. Additionally, depression was independently associated with falls and sensory impairment in feet was independently linked to balance/walking difficulty in all cancer types. Other independent factors of falls and balance/walking difficulty varied across cancer types. In breast cancer only, localized or regional cancer stage was significantly associated with increased odds of reporting falls and balance/walking difficulty, whereas treatment with radiation decreased the odds of falling. No association between falls and balance/walking difficulty with time since cancer diagnosis, cancer stage, or cancer treatment was found in colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   There exists some heterogeneity in factors associated with self-reported falls and balance/walking difficulty between different cancer types.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the ability of microRNA-150 (miR-150) targeting transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) to mediate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis through the β-catenin signaling pathway in PCa. Microarray analysis was performed to identify PCa-related differentially expressed genes, after which both the mirDIP and TargetScan databases were employed in the prediction of the miRNAs regulating TRPM4. Immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR were conducted to determine the expression pattern of miR-150 and TRPM4 in PCa. The relationship between miR-150 and TRPM4 expression was identified. By perturbing miR-150 and TRPM4 expression in PCa cells, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cycle, and apoptosis as well as EMT markers were determined accordingly. Finally, tumor growth and metastasis were evaluated among nude mice. Higher TRPM4 expression and lower miR-150 expression and activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway as well as EMT stimulation were detected in the PCa tissues. Our results confirmed TRPM4 as a target of miR-150. Upregulation of miR-150 resulted in inactivation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, the upregulation of miR-150 or knockdown of TRPM4 was observed to suppress EMT, proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro in addition to restrained tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.

LWI obtains multicompartment tissue information from a multiecho T2 dataset.  Purpose:   To compare a simplified LWI technique with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in classifying lesions based on groupings of PI-RADS v2 scores. Secondary aims were to investigate whether LWI differentiates between histologically confirmed tumor and normal tissue as effectively as ADC, and whether LWI is correlated with the multicompartment parameters of the vascular, extracellular, and restricted diffusion for cytometry in tumors (VERDICT) diffusion model.  Study type:   A subset of a larger prospective study.  Population:   In all, 65 male patients aged 49-79 were scanned.  Field strength/sequence:   A 32-echo T2 and a six b-value diffusion sequence (0, 90, 500, 1500, 2000, 3000 s/mm2 ) at 3T.  Assessment:   Regions of interest were placed by a board-certified radiologist in areas of lesion and benign tissue and given PI-RADS v2 scores.  Statistical tests:   Receiver operating characteristic and logistic regression analyses were performed.  Results:   LWI classifies tissue as PI-RADS 1,2 or PI-RADS 3,4,5 with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.779, compared with 0.764 for ADC. LWI differentiated histologically confirmed malignant from nonmalignant tissue with AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values of 0.81, 75%, and 87%, compared with 0.75, 83%, and 67% for ADC. The microstructural basis of the LWI technique is further suggested by the correspondence with the VERDICT diffusion-based microstructural imaging technique, with α, A1 , A2 , and LWF showing significant correlations.  Data conclusion:   LWI alone can predict PI-RADS v2 score groupings and detect histologically confirmed tumors with an ability similar to ADC alone without the limitations of diffusion-weighted MRI. This is important, given that ADC has an advantage in these tests as it already informs PI-RADS v2 scoring. LWI also provides multicompartment information that has an explicit biophysical interpretation, unlike ADC.  Level of evidence:   3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. Magn. Reson.

Harnessing deformability as a phenotype for screening applications requires a method that can simultaneously measure the deformability of hundreds of cell samples and can interface with existing high throughput facilities. Here we present a scalable cell filtration device, which relies on the pressure-driven deformation of cells through a series of pillars that are separated by micron-scale gaps on the timescale of seconds: less deformable cells occlude the gaps more readily than more deformable cells, resulting in decreased filtrate volume which is measured using a plate reader. The key innovation in this method is that we design customized arrays of individual filtration devices in a standard 96-well format using soft lithography, which enables multiwell input samples and filtrate outputs to be processed with higher throughput using automated pipette arrays and plate readers. To validate high throughput filtration to detect changes in cell deformability, we show the differential filtration of human ovarian cancer cells that have acquired cisplatin-resistance, which is corroborated with cell stiffness measurements using quantitative deformability cytometry. We also demonstrate differences in the filtration of human cancer cell lines, including ovarian cancer cells that overexpress transcription factors (Snail, Slug), which are implicated in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; breast cancer cells (malignant versus benign); and prostate cancer cells (highly versus weekly metastatic). We additionally show how the filtration of ovarian cancer cells is affected by treatment with drugs known to perturb the cytoskeleton and the nucleus.

Disturbances in this process will lead to complications in sperm development and subsequently cause infertility. As such, studying spermiogenesis has clinical relevance in investigating the etiology of male infertility and will improve our scientific understanding of male germ cell formation. Here, we were able to purify round spermatid and elongated spermatid fractions from a single cryopreserved human testicular tissues sample with an efficiency of 85.4% ± 4.9% and 97.6% ± 0.6%, respectively.

This method can be applied to both human and rodent studies. Especially in studies with limited access to testicular tissue, this method provides a reliable means to simultaneously isolate these cell types with high purity.

Accumulating data suggest that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may elicit a chemopreventive effect via V-ATPase inhibition in some cancers, but evidence is still limited. Therefore, we aimed to explore a potential preventive role of PPIs in this study.  Methods:   In this population-based case-control study, we identified incident cases of breast cancer (n = 1739), prostate cancer (n = 1897), and malignant melanoma (n = 385) in Iceland between 2005 and 2014 from the Icelandic Cancer Registry. We assessed varying levels of PPI use through record linkages to the Icelandic Medicines Registry. For each case, we selected up to 10 age-matched, sex-matched, and calendar-matched population controls using risk-set sampling. Using conditional logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) controlling for NSAID use.  Results:   Adjusted ORs associated with ever use of PPIs were 1.03 (95% CI: 0.92-1.16) for breast cancer, 1.12 (95% CI: 1.00-1.25) for prostate cancer, and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69-1.12) for malignant melanoma.

Moreover, CLU has been documented to modulate the cellular homolog of murine thymoma virus akt8 oncogene (AKT) activity. Here, we investigated how CLU overexpression influences phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling in human normal and cancer epithelial prostate cells. Human prostate cells stably transfected with CLU were broadly profiled by reverse phase protein array (RPPA), with particular emphasis on the PI3K/AKT pathway. The effect of CLU overexpression on normal and cancer cell motility was also tested. Our results clearly indicate that CLU overexpression enhances phosphorylation of AKT restricted to isoform 2. Mechanistically, this can be explained by the finding that the phosphatase PH domain leucine-rich repeat-containing protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1), known to dephosphorylate AKT2 at S474, is markedly downregulated by CLU, whereas miR-190, a negative regulator of PHLPP1, is upregulated. Moreover, we found that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was heavily phosphorylated at the inhibitory site S380, contributing to the hyperactivation of AKT signaling. By keeping AKT2 phosphorylation high, CLU dramatically enhances the migratory behavior of prostate epithelial cell lines with different migratory and invasive phenotypes, namely prostate normal epithelial 1A (PNT1A) and prostatic carcinoma 3 (PC3) cells. Altogether, our results unravel for the first time a circuit by which CLU can switch a low migration phenotype toward a high migration phenotype, through miR-190-dependent downmodulation of PHLPP1 expression and, in turn, stabilization of AKT2 phosphorylation.""","""['Jessika Bertacchini', 'Laura Mediani', 'Francesca Beretti', 'Marianna Guida', 'Aram Ghalali', 'Federica Brugnoli', 'Valeria Bertagnolo', 'Emanuel Petricoin', 'Francesco Poti', 'Jessica Arioli', 'Laura Anselmi', 'Alessia Bari', 'James McCubrey', 'Alberto M Martelli', 'Lucio Cocco', 'Silvano Capitani', 'Sandra Marmiroli']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Transcriptome-Based Analysis of Molecular Pathways for Clusterin Functions in Kidney Cells.', 'PHLPP is a negative regulator of RAF1, which reduces colorectal cancer cell motility and prevents tumor progression in mice.', 'Relationship between polycomb-group protein BMI-1 and phosphatases regulating AKT phosphorylation level in endometrial cancer.', 'Turning off AKT: PHLPP as a drug target.', 'Clusterin (CLU) and prostate cancer.', 'Risk of secondary tumours in patients with non-metastatic and metastatic human retinoblastoma.', 'The role and function of CLU in cancer biology and therapy.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Mechanisms Involved in the Promoting Activity of Fibroblasts in HTLV-1-Mediated Lymphomagenesis: Insights into the Plasticity of Lymphomatous Cells.', 'Comprehensive RNA-Seq Profiling Reveals Temporal and Tissue-Specific Changes in Gene Expression in Sprague-Dawley Rats as Response to Heat Stress Challenges.']"""

Inhibition of CTSB activity with its specific inhibitors, or by CTSB-targeting siRNA or CTSB with enzyme-negative domain attenuated activation of BRCA1 and DNA damage induced by RD-N. Conversely, CTSB overexpression resulted in inhibition of BRCA1 and sensitized PCa cells to RD-N-induced cell death. Furthermore, RD-N-induced cell death was exacerbated in BRCA1-deficient cancer cells. We also demonstrated that CTSB/BRCA1-dependent DNA damage was critical for RD-N, but not for etoposide, reinforcing the importance of CTSB/BRCA1 in RD-N-mediated cell death. In addition, RD-N synergistically increased cell sensitivity to cisplatin, and this effect was more evidenced in BRCA1-deficient cancer cells.

In the present study, we found that FAM3B expression was higher in ESCC tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we found similar results in cell lines. FAM3B expression was significantly related to T/TNM stage. Importantly, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that a high expression level of FAM3B predicted a poor outcome for ESCC patients. Overexpression of FAM3B inhibits ESCC cell death, increases oesophageal tumour growth in xenografted nude mice, and promotes ESCC cell migration and invasion. Further studies confirmed that FAM3B regulates the AKT-MDM2-p53 pathway and two core epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process markers, Snail and E-cadherin.

The most singular difficulty in the treatment of PCa is the failure to respond to classical androgen withdrawal or androgen blockade therapy, which often develops as the malignancy incurs genetic alterations and gain-of-function somatic mutations in the androgen receptor (AR). Physical cellular damaging therapeutic agents, such as radiation or activatable heat-generating transducers would circumvent classical ""anti-functional"" biological resistance, but to become ultimately effective would require directed application modalities. To this end, we have developed a novel AR-directed therapeutic agent by creating bivalent androgen hormone-AF-2 compounds that bind with high affinity to AR within cells. Here, we used molecular modeling and synthetic chemistry to create a number of compounds by conjugating 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to various AF-2 motif sequence peptides, through the use of a glycine and other spacer linkers. Our data indicates these compounds will bind to the AR in vitro and that altering the AF-2 peptide composition of the compound does indeed improve affinity for the AR.

Materials and methods:   Within the SEER database (2004-2014), we identified 2098 patients with histologically confirmed non-metastatic urothelial carcinoma of renal pelvis or ureter who underwent NU with LND. LNI rates stratified according to tumor location and stage were described. Kaplan-Meier plots illustrated CSM rates according to LNI and its extent. Multivariable Cox regression models (MCRMs) tested the effect of LNI and its extent on CSM.  Results:   Of 2098 UTUC patients, who underwent nephroureterectomy with lymph node dissection, 646 (33%) had LNI. The median number of removed lymph nodes was 3 [Interquartile range (IQR): 1-7]. The median number of positive lymph nodes in patients, who harbored LNI was 1 (IQR:1-3). LNI rates according to tumor location were, respectively, 23.6% for ureteral and 36.5% for renal pelvis tumors. LNI rates according to tumor stage were 9.6, 18.0, 38.7 and 63.9%, for respectively, T1, T2, T3 and T4 UTUC. In MCRMs, LNI achieved independent predictor status for higher CSM (HR 3.00; p < 0.001). Finally, in MCRMs, number of positive lymph nodes defined as the 75th percentile (n ≥ 3) achieved independent predictor status for higher CSM (HR 1.37; p = 0.04).

We present outcomes in a multicenter retrospective analysis of artificial urinary sphincter cuff reimplantation in patients with prior cuff erosion with special consideration given to the transcorporeal approach.  Materials and methods:   We compiled a multi-institutional database of patients who underwent artificial urinary sphincter reimplantation after prior urethral erosion.

Results:   The rate of subsequent complications after eroded cuff reimplantation was 32.4% (11 of 34 patients). The most frequent complication was recurrent erosion, which developed in 9 of the 34 patients (26.4%).

The rest of the physical exam was within normal limits, with the exception of an irregular heart rhythm. Laboratory tests were as follows: creatinine kinase (CK) 3200 U/L (normal: 39-308 U/L), CK-MB 65.7 mcg/L (normal: 0-7.6 mcg/L), troponin I 0.209 ng/mL (normal: 0-0.056 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed atrial fibrillation with QT prolongation (QTc 514 msec) and left anterior fascicular block, unchanged from baseline. 2D-echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65% with an enlarged left atrium, dilated right ventricle, and increased pulmonary artery pressure (45 mmHg). ProBNP was elevated at 1463 pg/mL and peaked at 3066 pg/mL one day after hydration. With a presumed diagnosis of autoimmune myositis and possible myocarditis, the patient was admitted and started on methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day. Cardiac MRI showed elevated native myocardial T1 values consistent with myocarditis (Fig. 1). The patient was discharged on a prednisone taper after normalization of cardiac enzymes on day 4. Treatment with PROSTVAC continued for three more months; nivolumab was discontinued. Six months later, patient is doing well, with no residual cardiac damage.  Discussion:   Cardiovascular irAEs are relatively rare (< 1%) and have a variety of clinical presentations. Myocarditis is potentially life-threatening and can range from subclinical to fulminant. Therefore, clinical suspicion, early detection, and prompt treatment are imperative (1). The initial diagnostic workup should include cardiac enzymes, ECG, and 2D-echocardiogram. The most commonly observed ECG changes are generalized repolarization abnormalities, prolonged QT interval, and conduction abnormalities (2). An elevated troponin I in the absence of overt coronary artery disease is suggestive of myocarditis and should be evaluated further. Myocardial biopsy is the standard diagnostic procedure; however, a cardiac MRI can achieve a diagnosis when biopsy is not feasible (3). Advancements in parametric mapping techniques have allowed the use of native myocardial T1 in the detection of myocarditis, as it has superior diagnostic performance and higher sensitivity than older parameters (3). Our patient had been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a therapeutic cancer vaccine to induce effective antitumor activity through immunogenic intensification and presented with muscle stiffness and elevated CK. Although he had no new cardiovascular symptoms, cardiac enzymes were tested to rule out myocardial involvement. MRI with gadolinium confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis. To date, none of the 1360 patients treated with PROSTVAC as a single agent have developed myocarditis, while myocarditis has been rarely reported in patients treated with nivolumab (< 1%) (1). Whether the combination of PROSTVAC and nivolumab presents an additional risk of myocarditis is unclear. To our knowledge, this is the first case of myocarditis in a patient with mCRPC receiving simultaneous treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a prostate cancer vaccine. Our experience highlights the importance of suspicion and early intervention in patients who present with cardiac abnormalities after receiving cancer immunotherapy. We propose following protocol: baseline troponin, ECG, and 2D-echocardiogram prior to treatment, then repeated troponin at 2, 4, and 12 weeks post-treatment, then monthly. If troponin becomes positive without alternative explanation, myocarditis should be ruled out with cardiac MRI or myocardial biopsy, and patient should be admitted for treatment with high-dose steroids as early intervention may minimize myocardial injury.""","""['Cecilia Monge', 'Hoyoung Maeng', 'Alessandra Brofferio', 'Andrea B Apolo', 'Bharath Sathya', 'Andrew E Arai', 'James L Gulley', 'Marijo Bilusic']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Ipilimumab- and nivolumab-induced myocarditis in a patient with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma: a case report.', 'A Fatal Case of Myocarditis Following Myositis Induced by Pembrolizumab Treatment for Metastatic Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial Carcinoma.', 'Myocarditis as an immune-related adverse event following treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a case report.', 'Third degree atrio-ventricular blockade during a myocarditis occurring under anti-PD1\xa0: Case report and literature review.', 'Fulminant myocarditis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab: a case report and review of the\xa0literature.', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors-Related Myocarditis: A Review of Reported Clinical Cases.', 'Has the Landscape of Immunotherapy for Prostate Cancer Changed?

GRP78 is overexpressed in many cancers, regulating a variety of signaling pathways associated with tumor initiation, proliferation, adhesion and invasion which contributes to metastatic spread. GRP78 can also regulate cell survival and apoptotic pathways to alter responsiveness to anticancer drugs. Tumors that reside in or metastasize to the bone and bone marrow (BM) space can develop pro-survival signals through their direct adhesive interactions with stromal elements of this niche thereby resisting the cytotoxic effects of drug treatment. In this study, we report a direct correlation between GRP78 and the adhesion molecule N-cadherin (N-cad), known to play a critical role in the adhesive interactions of multiple myeloma and metastatic prostate cancer with the bone microenvironment.  Methods:   N-cad expression levels (transcription and protein) were evaluated upon siRNA mediated silencing of GRP78 in the MM.1S multiple myeloma and the PC3 metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of GRP78 knockdown (KD) on epithelial-mesenchymal (EMT) transition markers, morphological changes and adhesion of PC3 cells.  Results:   GRP78 KD led to concomitant downregulation of N-cad in both tumors types. In PC3 cells, GRP78 KD significantly decreased E-cadherin (E-cad) expression likely associated with the induction in TGF-β1 expression. Furthermore, GRP78 KD also triggered drastic changes in PC3 cells morphology and decreased their adhesion to osteoblasts (OSB) dependent, in part, to the reduced N-cad expression.  Conclusion:   This work implicates GRP78 as a modulator of cell adhesion markers in MM and PCa. Our results may have clinical implications underscoring GRP78 as a potential therapeutic target to reduce the adhesive nature of metastatic tumors to the bone niche.""","""['Christopher N Cultrara', 'Stephen D Kozuch', 'Poornema Ramasundaram', 'Claudia J Heller', 'Sunil Shah', 'Adah E Beck', 'David Sabatino', 'Jenny Zilberberg']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Knockdown of glucose-regulated protein 78/binding immunoglobulin heavy chain protein expression by asymmetric small interfering RNA induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and attenuates migratory capability.', 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Enhanced Susceptibility to 5-Fluorouracil in Human Colon Cancer Cells by Silencing of GRP78.', 'Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) as a potential novel biomarker and therapeutic target in multiple myeloma.', 'Cell surface GRP78 signaling: An emerging role as a transcriptional modulator in cancer.', 'Is It Still Possible to Think about HSP70 as a Therapeutic Target in Onco-Hematological Diseases?', 'A CRISPR interference strategy for gene expression silencing in multiple myeloma cell lines.', 'Inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 destabilizes ERK phosphorylation and suppresses cancer proliferation via modulation of the tubulin acetylation-GRP78 interaction.', 'Heat Shock Protein 70 and 90 Family in Prostate Cancer.', 'Functionalized nanoparticles targeting biomarkers for prostate cancer imaging and therapy.']"""

Data collected included PSMA PET/CT, bone scan (30/142), mpMRI (112/142), and pathological T stage (pT) stage, Gleason score, surgical margins and lymph node status at RP. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was documented at staging scan, and following surgery (median 45 days (interquartile range 38-59). A PSA of < 0.03 ng ml-1 was classified as surgical response (SR). Logistic regression was performed for association of pre-operative clinical variables and SR.  Results::   97.9% (139/142) of males had positive intraprostatic findings on PSMA. 14.1 % (20/142) of males had further sites of extra prostatic disease identified on PSMA PET. In males with disease confined to the prostate, 82.9 % (92/111) achieved an SR, compared to 28.6 % (4/14) in males with extraprostatic disease identified (lymph node positive and distant metastatic disease) (p < 0.001). On binary logistic regression PSMA had a superior predictive value for SR than Gleason score, PSA (at time of imaging) or pT stage. MRI was less sensitive and more specific for SVI, and less sensitive for nodal involvement.  Conclusion::   Extraprostatic disease identified on staging pre-operative PSMA PET is independently predictive of a poor surgical response to RP, and may indicate a need for a multimodality approach to treatment.

The compound n-Butylidenephthalide (BP) is isolated from Angelica sinensis, which is used to treat anemia and gynecological dysfunction in traditional Chinese medicine. Studies have indicated that BP can inhibit cancers, including brain, lung, prostate, liver, and colon cancers. However, because BP is a natural hydrophobic compound, it is quickly metabolized by the liver within 24 h, and thus has limited potential for development in cancer therapy. This study investigated the anticancer mechanisms of BP through encapsulation with a novel polycationic liposome containing polyethylenimine (PEI) and polyethylene glycol complex (LPPC) in melanoma cells. The results demonstrated that BP/LPPC had higher cytotoxicity than BP alone and induced cell cycle arrest at the G₀/G₁ phase in B16/F10 melanoma cells. The BP/LPPC-treated cell indicated an increase in subG₁ percentage and TUNEL positive apoptotic morphology through induction of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. The combination of BP and LPPC and clinical drug 5-Fluorouracil had a greater synergistic inhibition effect than did a single drug. Moreover, LPPC encapsulation improved the uptake of BP values through enhancement of cell endocytosis and maintained BP cytotoxicity activity within 24 h. In conclusion, BP/LPPC can inhibit growth of melanoma cells and induce cell arrest and apoptosis, indicating that BP/LPPC has great potential for development of melanoma therapy agents.""","""['Hong-Wei Gao', 'Kai-Fu Chang', 'Xiao-Fan Huang', 'Yu-Ling Lin', 'Jun-Cheng Weng', 'Kuang-Wen Liao', 'Nu-Man Tsai']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Enhancement of cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis by cationic nano-liposome formulation of n-butylidenephthalide in breast cancer cells.', 'Antitumor Effects of N-Butylidenephthalide Encapsulated in Lipopolyplexs in Colorectal Cancer Cells.', 'Liposomal n-butylidenephthalide protects the drug from oxidation and enhances its antitumor effects in glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Encapsulated n-Butylidenephthalide Efficiently Crosses the Blood-Brain Barrier and Suppresses Growth of Glioblastoma.', 'Enhanced anticancer activity and endocytic mechanisms by polymeric nanocarriers of n-butylidenephthalide in leukemia cells.', 'Liposomes as Multifunctional Nano-Carriers for Medicinal Natural Products.', 'Ethnobotanical Survey on Skin Whitening Prescriptions of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Taiwan.', 'Enhancement of cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis by cationic nano-liposome formulation of n-butylidenephthalide in breast cancer cells.', 'Positively Charged Nanoparticle Delivery of n-Butylidenephthalide Enhances Antitumor Effect in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Advances in Natural or Synthetic Nanoparticles for Metastatic Melanoma Therapy and Diagnosis.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between May 2015 and October 2017, a total of 408 patients were referred to our clinic for MRI-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy of the prostate (FusPbx) due to suspected prostate cancer. In all patients, preoperatively an mpMRI of the prostate was performed by altogether 62 different radiologic institutes. Prostate lesions were classified according to the PIRADS system. A PIRADS 3 lesion was diagnosed in 41 patients. FusPbx was performed transrectally using a Philips EPIQ 7 (Philips Medical Systems, Bothell, WA) scanner with plane wise fusion of ultrasound and MRI image data. In addition to FusPbx in each patient a randomized 12-core transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy (USPbx) was performed.  Results:   Mean PSA Level was 9.5 ng/ml (range: 1- 26 ng/ml), mean patients age was 66.1 years (48.6- 80.4). In 11/41 patients (26.8%) prostate cancer was diagnosed by FusPbx of the PIRADS 3 lesion. In the target lesion PCa was classified as Gleason Score 3+3 in 5 patients, as 3+4 in 3, 4+3 in 1, 4+4 in 1 and 4+5 in 1 patient. In patients with negative FusPbx USPbx revealed PCa in another 7 patients (17.1%). In 5 of these GS 3+3 PCa was found, in another 2 patients GS 3+4 PCa.  Conclusions:   PIRADS 3 lesion indicates an equivocal likelihood of significant prostate cancer. In our series the overall PCa detection rate was 26.8% and 14.6% for clinically significant cancer in PIRADS 3 lesions. This evokes the question, if PIRADS 3 lesions could be surveilled only.

This report describes the landscape of PI3K alterations in solid tumors as well as co-alterations serving as potential resistance/attenuation mechanisms.  Methods:   Consecutive samples were analyzed in a commercial Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment-certified laboratory using comprehensive genomic profiling performed by next-generation sequencing (315 genes). The co-alterations evaluated included the Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), ERBB3, ERBB4, RAS, MET proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MET), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K) genes as well as tumor protein 53 (TP53), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and androgen receptor (AR).  Results:   Alterations in any of 18 PI3K-pathway associated genes were identified in 44% of 60,991 tumors. Although single base and insertions/deletions (indels) were the most frequent alterations, copy number changes and rearrangements were identified in 11% and 0.9% of patients, respectively. Overall, the most frequently altered genes were PIK3 catalytic subunit α (PIK3CA) (13%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (9%), and serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) (5%). Tumor types that frequently harbored at least 1 PI3K alteration were uterine (77%), cervical (62%), anal (59%), and breast (58%) cancers. Alterations also were discerned frequently in tumors with carcinosarcoma (89%) and squamous cell carcinoma (62%) histologies. Tumors with a greater likelihood of co-occurring PI3K pathway and MAPK pathway alterations included colorectal cancers (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; P < .001), mesotheliomas (OR, 2.67; P = .024), anal cancers (OR, 1.98; P = .03), and nonsquamous head and neck cancers (OR, 2.03; P = .019).

Bicalutamide (BIC) was encased into surface functionalized MCM-41 nanoparticles via electrostatic interactions. The synthesized NPs were characterized by nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms, SEM-EDS, TEM, LXRD, and WXRD. In vitro release studies demonstrated that BIC-MSN-PAA NPs exhibited a higher release in the acidic media which varied inversely with the increase in pH. Further, the results of cell cytotoxicity assay were evident that BICMSNs exhibited more potent killing of both PC-3 and LNCaP cells than free BIC. PAA-MSNs also exhibited an enhanced cellular uptake and prolonged circulation time in vivo.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Hence, it is important to identify specific and effective therapeutic targets, to be able to determine appropriate therapy and management. So, this study aimed to predict that miR-93-5p is an important oncogene in prostate cancer by bioinformatics analysis.  Methods:   In this study, initially we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differently expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, performed Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis, then investigated the relationship between DEGs and DEMs, and finally through consulting the literature and retrieving the database, we found that miR-93-5p may play a major role in prostate cancer, so we predicted the expression and survival of miR-93-5p and its isomers by bioinformatics analysis, meanwhile, evaluated the function of miR-93-5p in vitro.  Results:   In total, 104 DEMs were differently expressed between prostate cancer and normal samples, including 56 downregulated ones and 48 upregulated ones; miR-93-5p (upregulated) was identified as a good biomarker. And 1904 DEGs were retrieved, including 794 downregulated ones and 1110 upregulated ones. We also obtained 1254 DEGs of the DEMs. In GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, the significantly enriched pathways involved pathway in focal adhesion, vascular smooth muscle contraction, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. By the KEGG pathway, we got 16 target genes and 92 pathways of the miR-93-5p in prostate cancer. We also found that the miR-93-5p and its isomers can express in prostate cancer, and which with a high expression had a poor overall survival and a significant difference recurrence rate within 5 years. Further in vitro verification results demonstrated that the low expression of miR-93-5p can inhibit cell proliferation, migration, invasion, change cell cycle, and promote early apoptosis of PC-3 cells.  Conclusion:   The miR-93-5p and its target genes were used to define important molecular targets that could serve as a prognostic and predictive marker in the treatment of prostate cancer. Further research on the function of the miR-93-5p and its target genes in the KEGG pathway could provide references for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Yuemei Yang', 'Binghan Jia', 'Xiaoling Zhao', 'Yao Wang', 'Weiliang Ye']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Role of miR-452-5p in the tumorigenesis of prostate cancer: A study based on the Cancer Genome Atl(TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and bioinformatics analysis.', 'Screening of Target Genes and Regulatory Function of miRNAs as Prognostic Indicators for Prostate Cancer.', 'MiR-96-5p inhibition induces cell apoptosis in gastric adenocarcinoma.', 'The potential of microRNAs as human prostate cancer biomarkers: A meta-analysis of related studies.', 'Role of miRNA-145, 148, and 185 and Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'Activation of the HNRNPA2B1/miR-93-5p/FRMD6 axis facilitates prostate cancer progression in an m6A-dependent manner.', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influence Hub Genes Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Transcriptome-Wide Analysis of microRNA-mRNA Correlations in Tissue Identifies microRNA Targeting Determinants.', 'Novel plasma exosome biomarkers for prostate cancer progression in co-morbid metabolic disease.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.']"""

Previous studies by others indicated that the risks associated with reduced NKX3.1 levels can be enhanced by anti-oxidant supplementation. Selenium is an essential component of several proteins with anti-oxidant functions and lower levels of selenium have been associated with greater risk of prostate cancer. In contrast, participants of the select prostate cancer prevention trial were at increased risk of prostate cancer when supplemented with selenium when their baseline selenium levels were high.  Methods:   In order to investigate whether there was an interaction between a functional polymorphism in NKX3.1 that results in less protein and selenium status with prostate cancer grade or outcome, plasma selenium levels and the genotypes of NKX3.1 and the selenium carrier protein SELENOP were determined from a cohort of men who underwent radical protatectomy.  Results:   NKX3.1 and SELENOP genotypes were associated with a more aggressive prostate tumor grade at the time of prostatectomy, but there were no significant interactions of NKX3.1 genotype with either selenium status or SELENOP genotype. There was also a significant association between NKX3.1 genotype and prostate cancer recurrence, however this association was modified by SELENOP genotype, but not with plasma selenium levels.

However, whether it also plays important roles in promoting the development of testicular cancer is not well-understood. Objective: To study the expression of HOXA10 and its regulated signaling pathways in testicular cancers. Design, Setting, and Participants: A tissue microarray was constructed with benign and cancerous testis. TCam2, NT-2, and NCCIT cell models were applied in this study. Intervention: Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed to measure the expression and cellular localization of HOXA10 in testicular cancer tissues and cell models. Cell proliferation and cell cycling rates were determined by BrdU incorporation and flow cytometry assays. HOXA10 transcriptomes were profiled with Ampliseq RNA-seq in testicular cancer cells. Immunoblotting assays were used to detect HOXA10-regulated signaling. Results: HOXA10 is a nuclear protein in benign spermatocytes. Reduced nuclear expression and increased cytoplasmic expression of HOXA10 are associated with testicular cancers. These changes are consistent in both seminoma and non-seminoma. Enhanced HOXA10 expression in testicular cancer cell models inhibits cell proliferation and delays cell cycle progression through G2/M phases. These functions of HOXA10 mainly affect the TP53, cKit, STAT3, AKT, and ERK signaling pathways.

Aiming to evaluate whether DT-13 could become a candidate to treat prostate cancer, we recently investigated the antitumor effect of DT-13 on human prostate cancer cells and the underlying mechanism. DT-13 was found to effectively inhibit proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment by DT-13 resulted in a mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, which was accompanied by the chromatin condensation and nuclear shrinkage in the prostate cancer cells. Moreover, DT-13 caused remarkable upregulation of Bax, Bad, Cytochrome C, cleaved -caspase 3, -caspase 9 and -PARP, in contrast to the downregulation of Bcl-2. Nevertheless, no obvious change in intracellular ROS level was observed after DT-13 treatment. We further demonstrated that DT-13 could inhibit PC3 cell metastasis in which suppression of Integrinβ1 and MMP2/9 might be involved. Western blot analysis indicated DT-13 significantly decreased the phosphorylation of PDK1, Akt, mTOR as well as p70S6K, suggesting the pro-apoptotic and anti-metastatic effects of DT-13 on prostate cancer cells might be attributed to the blockade of PI3K/Akt pathway.

However, poor tumor penetration remains a key problem for the efficacy of IL-24 as a treatment. iRGD is a novel tumor-specific peptide with unique tumor-penetrating and cell-internalizing properties. To enhance the tumor-penetrating and antitumor effects of IL-24, we engineered a recombinant protein consisting of the IL-24 fused to iRGD, which was named IL-24-iRGD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antitumor effects of IL-24-iRGD in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. It was observed that IL-24-iRGD induced cell apoptosis, suppressed cell growth of PC-3 in vitro, and promoted protein penetration into tumors in vivo, whereas it had no effect on normal cell line RWPE-1. Then, PC-3 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, and these tumor-bearing mice were administered with IL-24, IL-24-iRGD, or PBS via the tail vein. The IL-24- and IL-24-iRGD-treated groups exhibited tumor growth inhibition rates of 38.6% and 65.6%, respectively, when compared with the PBS-treated group. Besides, cell apoptosis was examined by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. The results demonstrated that IL-24-iRGD induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of PC-3 cells to a significantly greater extent when compared with IL-24 treatment alone.

Aim of the study:   This study was designed to investigate the effects of CP on mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and cell proliferation using prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   Prostatic LNCaP, DU-145, lung adenocarcinoma and healthy VERO cells were used to assess cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis was evaluated by flow cytometry. Levels of pro-apoptotic Bax, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Cytochrome C Release (CCR) and activation of caspases 3(C3) and 9 (C9) were determined by ELISA, while mitochondrial integrity was evaluated by Fluorescent Intensity Ratio (FIR).  Results:   Methanol Fraction of C. portoricensis (MFCP) inhibited proliferation of prostatic LNCaP, DU-145, lung adenocarcinoma and healthy VERO cells with IC50 values of 2.4 ± 0.2, 3.3 ± 0.2, 3.6 ± 0.2 and 17.9 ± 1.6 µg/mL, respectively. The growth inhibition by MFCP correlated with a 3-fold decreased expression of Bcl-2 and a 4-fold increase in Bax levels at 10 µg/mL in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, MFCP caused a 3.5-fold reduction in FIR at 10 µg/mL and induced CCR by 4.2 folds at the same concentration relative to control. The MFCP-induced CCR is associated with activation of C3 and C9 at 10 µg/mL by 4.2 and 5.1 folds, respectively which prompted cancer cells to arrest at S phase. The LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of polyphenols including gallic acid and afzelechin in MFCP.

Zoledronic acid is effective in preventing androgen suppression-induced bone loss, but its role in preventing castration-sensitive bone metastases in locally advanced prostate cancer is unclear. The RADAR trial assessed whether the addition of 12 months of adjuvant androgen suppression, 18 months of zoledronic acid, or both, can improve outcomes in men with locally advanced prostate cancer who receive 6 months of androgen suppression and prostatic radiotherapy. This report presents 10-year outcomes from this trial.  Methods:   For this randomised, phase 3, 2 × 2 factorial trial, eligible men were 18 years or older with locally advanced prostate cancer (either T2b-4, N0 M0 tumours or T2a, N0 M0 tumours provided Gleason score was ≥7 and baseline prostate-specific antigen [PSA] concentration was ≥10 μg/L). We randomly allocated participants in a 2 × 2 factorial design by computer-generated randomisation (using the minimisation technique, and stratified by centre, baseline PSA concentration, clinical tumour stage, Gleason score, and use of a brachytherapy boost) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to four treatment groups. Patients in the control group received 6 months of neoadjuvant androgen suppression with leuprorelin (22·5 mg every 3 months, intramuscularly) and radiotherapy alone (short-term androgen suppression [STAS]); this treatment was either followed by another 12 months of adjuvant androgen suppression with leuprorelin (22·5 mg every 3 months, intramuscularly; intermediate-term androgen suppression [ITAS]), or accompanied by 18 months of zoledronic acid (4 mg every 3 months, intravenously) starting at randomisation (STAS plus zoledronic acid), or both (ITAS plus zoledronic acid). All patients received radiotherapy to the prostate and seminal vesicles, starting from the end of the fifth month of androgen suppression; dosing options were 66, 70, and 74 Gy in 2-Gy fractions per day, or 46 Gy in 2-Gy fractions followed by a high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost dose of 19·5 Gy in 6·5-Gy fractions. Treatment allocation was open label. The primary endpoint was prostate cancer-specific mortality and was analysed according to intention-to-treat using competing-risks methods. The trial is closed to follow-up and this is the final report of the main endpoints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00193856.  Findings:   Between Oct 20, 2003, and Aug 15, 2007, 1071 men were enrolled and randomly assigned to STAS (n=268), ITAS (n=268), STAS plus zoledronic acid (n=268), and ITAS plus zoledronic acid (n=267). Median follow-up was 10·4 years (IQR 7·9-11·7). At this 10-year follow-up, no interactions were observed between androgen suppression and zoledronic acid so the treatment groups were collapsed to compare treatments according to duration of androgen suppression: 6 months of androgen suppression plus radiotherapy (6AS+RT) versus 18 months of androgen suppression plus radiotherapy (18AS+RT) and to compare treatments according to whether or not patients received zoledronic acid. The total number of deaths was 375 (200 men receiving 6AS+RT and 175 men receiving 18AS+RT), of which 143 (38%) were attributable to prostate cancer (81 men receiving 6AS+RT and 62 men receiving 18AS+RT). When analysed by duration of androgen suppression, the adjusted cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific mortality was 13·3% (95% CI 10·3-16·0) for 6AS+RT versus 9·7% (7·3-12·0) for 18AS+RT, representing an absolute difference of 3·7% (95% CI 0·3-7·1; sub-hazard ratio [sHR] 0·70 [95% CI 0·50-0·98], adjusted p=0·035). The addition of zoledronic acid did not affect prostate cancer-specific mortality; the adjusted cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific mortality was 11·2% (95% CI 8·7-13·7) with zoledronic acid vs 11·7% (9·2-14·1) without, representing an absolute difference of -0·5% (95% CI -3·8 to 2·9; sHR 0·95 [95% CI 0·69-1·32], adjusted p=0·78). Although safety analysis was not prespecified for this 10-year analysis, one new serious adverse event (osteonecrosis of the mandible, in a patient who received 18 months of androgen suppression plus zoledronic acid) occurred since our previous report, bringing the total number of cases of this serious adverse event to three (<1% out of 530 patients who received zoledronic acid evaluated for safety) and the total number of drug-related serious adverse events to 12 (1% out of all 1065 patients evaluable for safety). No treatment-related deaths occurred during the study.  Interpretation:   18 months of androgen suppression plus radiotherapy is a more effective treatment option for locally advanced prostate cancer than 6 months of androgen suppression plus radiotherapy, but the addition of zoledronic acid to this treatment regimen is not beneficial. Evidence from the RADAR and French Canadian Prostate Cancer Study IV trials suggests that 18 months of androgen suppression with moderate radiation dose escalation is an effective but more tolerable option than longer durations of androgen suppression for men with locally advanced prostate cancer including intermediate and high risk elements.

However, a significant proportion of oligometastatic PC patients progress to polymetastatic PC within a year following MDT, suggesting an underestimation of the metastatic load by current staging modalities. Molecular markers could help to identify true oligometastatic patients eligible for MDT.  Methods:   Patients with asymptomatic biochemical recurrence following primary PC treatment were classified as oligo- or polymetastatic based on 18F-choline PET/CT imaging. Oligometastatic patients had up to three metastases at baseline and did not progress to more than three lesions following MDT or surveillance within 1 year of diagnosis of metastases. Polymetastatic patients had > 3 metastases at baseline or developed > 3 metastases within 1 year following imaging. A model aiming to prospectively distinguish oligo- and polymetastatic PC patients was trained using clinicopathological parameters and serum-derived microRNA expression profiles from a discovery cohort of 20 oligometastatic and 20 polymetastatic PC patients. To confirm the models predictive performance, it was applied on biomarker data obtained from an independent validation cohort of 44 patients with oligometastatic and 39 patients with polymetastatic disease.  Results:   Oligometastatic PC patients had a more favorable prognosis compared to polymetastatic ones, as defined by a significantly longer median CRPC-free survival (not reached versus 38 months; 95% confidence interval 31-45 months with P < 0.001). Despite the good performance of a predictive model trained on the discovery cohort, with an AUC of 0.833 (0.693-0.973; 95% CI) and a sensitivity of 0.894 (0.714-1.000; 95% CI) for oligometastatic disease, none of the miRNA targets were found to be differentially expressed between oligo- and polymetastatic PC patients in the signature validation cohort. The multivariate model had an AUC of 0.393 (0.534 after cross-validation) and therefore, no predictive ability.

Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) develops resistance to inhibitors of androgen receptor (AR) signaling through a variety of mechanisms, including the emergence of the constitutively active AR variant V7 (AR-V7). Here, we developed an FASN inhibitor (IPI-9119) and demonstrated that selective FASN inhibition antagonizes CRPC growth through metabolic reprogramming and results in reduced protein expression and transcriptional activity of both full-length AR (AR-FL) and AR-V7. Activation of the reticulum endoplasmic stress response resulting in reduced protein synthesis was involved in IPI-9119-mediated inhibition of the AR pathway. In vivo, IPI-9119 reduced growth of AR-V7-driven CRPC xenografts and human mCRPC-derived organoids and enhanced the efficacy of enzalutamide in CRPC cells. In human mCRPC, both FASN and AR-FL were detected in 87% of metastases. AR-V7 was found in 39% of bone metastases and consistently coexpressed with FASN. In patients treated with enzalutamide and/or abiraterone FASN/AR-V7 double-positive metastases were found in 77% of cases.

However, extensive overuse of guideline-discordant imaging continues to persist. Incidental findings are common on imaging and little is known about the optimal management. Rates of incidental findings vs. false positive diagnosis from inappropriate imaging are poorly understood and have yet to be quantified for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients.  Objective:   To determine the frequency of positive radiologic findings in patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer during initial staging at VA New York Harbor Healthcare System.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed all low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients' medical records from the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System for diagnosis from 2005 to 2015. We reviewed each individual's prebiopsy prostate specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, and clinical stage. We also determined if imaging obtained yielded a false positive, incidental finding, or if metastatic disease occurred within the 6 months following initial diagnosis.  Results:   There were 414 men, who were classified as low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer and underwent inappropriate staging imaging of 4,306 men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Of these 414 men, 178 (43%) had additional follow-up imaging for positive findings. We calculated an incidental finding rate of 10% and a false positive rate of 38% for patients. Five (1%) patients had metastatic disease.  Conclusion:   Despite guideline recommendations, imaging overuse remains an issue for low-intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. The false positive rate found in this analysis is alarmingly high at 38%. This use of scans is burdensome to the healthcare system and patient. This study highlights the frequency of inappropriate imaging and its negative consequences.""","""['Siri Drangsholt', 'Dawn Walter', 'Shannon Ciprut', 'Abbey Lepor', 'Erica Sedlander', 'Caitlin Curnyn', 'Stacy Loeb', 'Patrick Malloy', 'Aaron N Winn', 'Danil V Makarov']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Establishing the pathways and indications for performing isotope bone scans in newly diagnosed intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer - results from a large contemporaneous cohort.', 'Bone scan overuse in staging of prostate cancer: an analysis of a Veterans Affairs cohort.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Capromab Pendetide imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Combined modality staging of prostate carcinoma and its utility in predicting pathologic stage and postoperative prostate specific antigen failure.', 'Impact of choosing wisely on imaging in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'Characterizing and quantifying low-value diagnostic imaging internationally: a scoping review.', 'The cost, survival, and quality-of-life implications of guideline-discordant imaging for prostate cancer.']"""

Intensification of systemic treatment is the standard of care. Recently, 68Ga prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) imaging was introduced to identify oligometastatic prostate cancer patients. In this retrospective, exploratory study, we report on the efficacy of PSMA-PET-guided local ablative radiotherapy (aRT) in 15 oligometastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients, selected from our prospective institutional database and treated between 2013 and 2016. After multidisciplinary discussion, aRT was delivered with two different schedules. Androgen deprivation therapy remained unchanged. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and time to PSA progression were analysed. For comparison, individual time to PSA progression without aRT was estimated by individual PSA doubling time (PSADT). PSA response was observed in 11 patients (73%). Mean time to PSA progression or last follow-up was 17.9mo, as opposed to 2.9mo estimated from the PSADT without aRT (p<0.001). A relevant subset of CRPC patients had a PSA response with aRT to PET-positive lead metastases. A prospective trial is in preparation. PATIENT SUMMARY: In selected patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase during androgen deprivation, metastases were detected with prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography imaging. Fifteen patients with three or fewer metastases were treated with high-dose radiotherapy. Subsequently, PSA values dropped in 11 patients and in six patients no PSA progression was detected for >12mo.""","""['Fabian Lohaus', 'Klaus Zöphel', 'Steffen Löck', 'Manfred Wirth', 'Jörg Kotzerke', 'Mechthild Krause', 'Michael Baumann', 'Esther G C Troost', 'Tobias Hölscher']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Fabian Lohaus, Klaus Zöphel, Steffen Löck, et al.

Most MBCs are hormone-driven. Not only the estrogen receptor (ER), but also other steroid hormone receptors, including the androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor (PgR) are expressed in MBC. AR activation in breast cancer cells facilitates downstream gene expression that drives tumorigenesis in a similar manner to ER. AR-mediated signalling works paradoxically in breast cancer and prostate cancer, and cancer cells expressing the AR are endocrine-sensitive.  Case presentation:   We describe a case of double cancer of MBC and prostate cancer. A 69-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a lump in his left breast in the 1990s. The patient had cT3N3M0, stage IIIC breast cancer, and underwent a mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Though adjuvant chemotherapy was administered, he experienced pleural metastasis 2 months after the surgery. Two years after the recurrence during endocrine therapy with oral 5-fluorouracil, he complained of frequent urination. Radiological and histological examinations revealed that the patient had cT3N0M0, stage III primary prostate cancer with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 40.5 ng/mL. Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were not tested. He received multidisciplinary, continuous therapy for both breast and prostate cancer; however, 5 and 3 years after each diagnosis, respectively, he experienced a deep vein thrombosis in his right leg related to the endocrine therapy. Liver metastasis progressed after he stopped breast cancer therapy. However, long-term disease control had been achieved with anti-estrogen therapy for breast cancer and estrogen replacement therapy for prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Several studies have shown that estrogen exposure after estrogen depletion likely causes apoptosis of ER-positive breast cancer cells. Our findings indicate that this also applies to the environment in male body. AR dominant signaling prevents breast cancer recurrence and metastasis, especially in MBC patients.""","""['Haruko Takuwa', 'Wakako Tsuji', 'Masayuki Shintaku', 'Fumiaki Yotsumoto']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Androgen receptor expression in male breast cancer predicts inferior outcome and poor response to tamoxifen treatment.', 'Clinicopathological and Immunohistochemical Characteristics in Male Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Case Series.', 'Long-term survival and BRCA status in male breast cancer: a retrospective single-center analysis.', 'Androgen receptor action in hormone-dependent and recurrent prostate cancer.', ""Androgen receptor in breast cancer: A wolf in sheep's clothing?

However, the highly sparse data matrices generated by the technology have posed an obstacle to the analysis of differential gene regulatory networks.  Results:   Addressing the challenges, this study presents, as far as we know, the first bioinformatics tool for scRNA-Seq-based differential network analysis (scdNet). The tool features a sample size adjustment of gene-gene correlation, comparison of inter-state correlations, and construction of differential networks. A simulation analysis demonstrated the power of scdNet in the analyses of sparse scRNA-Seq data matrices, with low requirement on the sample size, high computation efficiency, and tolerance of sequencing noises. Applying the tool to analyze two datasets of single circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of prostate cancer and early mouse embryos, our data demonstrated that differential gene regulation plays crucial roles in anti-androgen resistance and early embryonic development.  Conclusions:   Overall, the tool is widely applicable to datasets generated by the emerging technology to bring biological insights into tumor heterogeneity and other studies.

This raised the need for novel agents for the treatment of prostate cancer. In the present study, five phthalimide-based curcumin derivatives were synthesized and completely characterized to assess improved stability, pharmacodynamics, and radical scavenging ability. To investigate the potential application in anti-cancer therapy, the anti-proliferative activity of the synthesized molecules was determined on aggressive prostate tumor cells. We demonstrated that the K3F21 derivative has increased potency compared to curcumin, in terms of GI50, anti-proliferative and anti-migrating activities. K3F21 inhibits anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of prostate cancer cells by altering the expression of key genes controlling cell proliferation, such as Cylins D1, B1 and B2, and apoptosis, among which Puma, Noxa, and Bcl-2 family members. Finally, the anti-cancer activity of K3F21 was demonstrated by the analysis of cancer-associated PI3K/AKT, ERK, and p38 signaling pathways.""","""['Silvia Belluti', 'Giulia Orteca', 'Valentina Semeghini', 'Giovanna Rigillo', 'Francesca Parenti', 'Erika Ferrari', 'Carol Imbriano']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Curcumin-Gene Expression Response in Hormone Dependent and Independent Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Anti-proliferative potential of curcumin in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells occurs through modulation of the Wingless signaling pathway.', 'Androgen responsive and refractory prostate cancer cells exhibit distinct curcumin regulated transcriptome.', 'Curcumin against Prostate Cancer: Current Evidence.', 'Curcumin and Its Derivatives as Potential Therapeutic Agents in Prostate, Colon and Breast Cancers.', 'Potentiation of TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis in TRAIL-Resistant Cholangiocarcinoma Cells by Curcumin through the Induction of DR5 Membrane Localization and Disruption of the Anti-Apoptotic Complex DR5/DDX3/GSK3β.', 'Spectrofluorimetric and Computational Investigation of New Phthalimide Derivatives towards Human Neutrophil Elastase Inhibition and Antiproliferative Activity.', 'Effects of Curcumin and Lactoferrin to Inhibit the Growth and Migration of Prostatic Cancer Cells.', 'Development of machine learning classifiers to predict compound activity on prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Curcumin-Based β-Diketo Ligands for Ga3+: Thermodynamic Investigation of Potential Metal-Based Drugs.']"""

However, the association between dietary zinc and prostate cancer (PC) in epidemiologic studies is a conflicting one. Our aim was to explore this association in an MCC-Spain case-control study, considering tumor aggressiveness and extension, as well as genetic susceptibility to PC. 733 incident cases and 1228 population-based controls were included for this study. Dietary zinc was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, and genetic susceptibility was assessed with a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-based polygenic risk score (PRS). The association between zinc intake and PC was evaluated with mixed logistic and multinomial regression models. They showed an increased risk of PC in those with higher intake of zinc (Odds Ratio (OR) tertile 3vs1: 1.39; 95% Confidence interval (CI):1.00⁻1.95). This association was mainly observed in low grade PC (Gleason = 6 RRR tertile 3vs1: 1.76; 95% CI:1.18⁻2.63) as well as in localized tumors (cT1-cT2a RRR tertile 3vs1: 1.40; 95% CI:1.00⁻1.95) and among those with higher PRS (OR tertile 3vs1: 1.50; 95% CI:0.89⁻2.53). In conclusion, a higher dietary zinc intake could increase the risk of low grade and localized tumors. Men with higher genetic susceptibility0020might also have a higher risk of PC associated with this nutrient intake.""","""['Enrique Gutiérrez-González', 'Adela Castelló', 'Pablo Fernández-Navarro', 'Gemma Castaño-Vinyals', 'Javier Llorca', 'Dolores Salas', 'Inmaculada Salcedo-Bellido', 'Nuria Aragonés', 'Guillermo Fernández-Tardón', 'Juan Alguacil', 'Esther Gracia-Lavedan', 'Esther García-Esquinas', 'Inés Gómez-Acebo', 'Pilar Amiano', 'Dora Romaguera', 'Manolis Kogevinas', 'Marina Pollán', 'Beatriz Pérez-Gómez']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nutrients""","""['Mediterranean Dietary Pattern is Associated with Low Risk of Aggressive Prostate Cancer: MCC-Spain Study.', 'Dietary inflammatory index and prostate cancer risk in a case-control study in Mexico.', 'Adult dietary intake and prostate cancer risk in Utah: a case-control study with special emphasis on aggressive tumors.', 'Dietary zinc and prostate cancer risk: a case-control study from Italy.', 'Increased inflammatory potential of diet is associated with increased odds of prostate cancer in Argentinian men.', 'A Systematic Study on Zinc-Related Metabolism in Breast Cancer.', 'Micronutrients and risks of three main urologic cancers: A mendelian randomization study.', 'An Overview of Essential Microelements and Common Metallic Nanoparticles and Their Effects on Male Fertility.', 'Dietary Patterns and Prostate Cancer: CAPLIFE Study.', 'Increased SPC24 in prostatic diseases and diagnostic value of SPC24 and its interacting partners in prostate cancer.']"""

This represents one of the largest published series of patients at intermediate and high risk.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective multicenter analysis of patients who underwent partial gland ablation between January 2013 and September 2017. Patients with biopsy proven localized disease and limited multifocality based on magnetic resonance imaging who preferred minimally invasive outpatient therapy were treated with the Sonablate® 500 system. Oncologic and functional outcomes were analyzed as well as risk factors for recurrence.  Results:   A total of 166 procedures were performed in 150 patients. Grade Group 2 or greater was present in 89% of cases. Mean ± SD followup was 24.3 ± 14.4 months. Mean prostate specific antigen decreased 65% from 7.9 ± 6.8 ng/ml to a nadir of 2.7 ± 3.1 ng/ml. Confirmatory biopsies were performed in 87 patients (52%) at high risk for recurrence. Clinically significant cancer (Grade Group 2 or greater) was detected in 37 cases (42%). Patients with a higher number of positive cores, a medial tumor location or higher prostate specific antigen had a higher probability of recurrence. Salvage treatment was done in 37 patients (24.6%), including 16 repeat partial gland ablation procedures.  Conclusions:   Partial gland ablation with high intensity focused ultrasound therapy was safe and it had a minimal impact on functional outcomes. Local recurrence and/or failure occurred in 42% of patients at high risk for recurrence. Medially located tumors were associated with a higher failure rate. Serious complications were rare.

We investigated whether PI-RADS version 2 also predicts adverse pathology features mainly in patients with biopsy Gleason score 3 + 4 disease.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the records of 326 consecutive men with a preoperative template and/or magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion biopsy Gleason score of 6-7 from a prospectively maintained database of men who underwent robotic radical prostatectomy. The primary analysis was done in patients with biopsy Gleason score 3 + 4 to assess the primary outcome of adverse pathology features on univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The secondary outcome was biochemical recurrence-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier method. Similar analysis was done in patients with a biopsy Gleason score of 6-7.  Results:   Of men with Gleason score 3 + 4 findings 27%, 15%, 36% and 23% showed a PI-RADS version 2 score of 0-2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. On univariate analysis PI-RADS version 2 category 5 predicted adverse pathology features vs categories 0-2 (OR 10.7, 95% CI 3.7-31, p ≤0.001). On multivariate analysis the PI-RADS version 2 category 5 was associated with adverse pathology when adjusting for preoperative magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy (OR 11.4, 95% CI 3.7-35, p ≤0.0001). In men with a targeted biopsy Gleason score of 3 + 4 prostate cancer PI-RADS version 2 category 5 was associated with adverse pathology (OR 14.7, 95% CI 1.5-146.9, p = 0.02).

Patients and methods:   A 62-year-old patient diagnosed as having biopsy-proven localized prostate cancer in March 2016 who had undergone renal transplant 12 years ago was studied. The preoperative prostate-specific antigen value was determined to be 11.82 ng/mL and the Gleason score was determined to be 3 + 3. The RARP was carried out using a transperitoneal and posterior approach with 5 ports in May 2016. The most important technique was ensuring that the transplanted kidney and ureter remained untouched during the surgery. Only the right obturator lymph nodes were dissected because the renal allograft was overlying the iliac vessels.  Results:   The RARP was successfully concluded following 230 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 200 mL. There were no postoperative complications. Final pathology was T2cN0M0, Gleason 3 + 3. Following catheter removal, the patient was completely continent and was discharged with no change in serum creatinine or glomerular filtration rate levels. During a 21-month follow-up, unobstructed urination, no incontinence, no biochemical recurrence, and normal kidney function were observed.  Conclusion:   RARP in Chinese renal allograft patients is a feasible method that can be accomplished with no injuries to the transplanted kidney or ureter and is achieved with favorable oncological and functional outcomes. In addition, post-kidney transplant male patients are recommended to have routine prostate-specific antigen screening for the early detection of prostate cancer.""","""['Y Fang', 'Z Chen', 'L Juan', 'Z Feng', 'J Cao', 'B Zhou', 'Y Huang', 'J Cen', 'J Lu', 'Y Liang', 'J Wei', 'J Luo', 'W Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Transplant Proc""","""['Applicability of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in renal allograft recipients.', 'Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Robotic Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer in Renal Transplant Recipients: Results from a Multicenter Series.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy - review of the literature concerning oncological and functional outcome of patients.', 'Salvage of an iatrogenic partial allograft nephrectomy during caesarean section-a case report.']"""

In this study, we reconsidered unexplored ubiquitously present low molecular mass species of PSA regarding to molecular mass, origin and pathophysiological source specificity in order to evaluate them as biomarkers.  Methods:   Data on low molecular mass PSA-immunoreactive species from sera of subjects with prostate cancer (PCa), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), breast cancer (BCa), and urine of healthy males obtained by on-chip immunoaffinity chromatography combined with mass spectrometry were analyzed.  Results:   The results obtained indicated PSA species common to BCa, PCa, and BPH at 12-13 kDa, 17-19 kDa and 21-24 kDa. The striking difference in predominant frequencies made the profile characteristic in each examined pathophysiological condition. On the other hand, paired groups of prostatic and extraprostatic PSA contained rare species with small differences among groups concerning individual species. Low molecular mass PSA also included rare species unique for each group of samples.  Conclusion:   The results obtained revealed that uniformity of low molecular mass PSA-immunoreactive species in sera prevails over diversity related to cancer and non-cancer conditions, but at the same time some of them are molecules with biomarker potential for BPH detection.""","""['Sanja Goč', 'Miroslava Jankovič']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Med Biochem""","""['Evaluation of molecular species of prostate-specific antigen complexed with immunoglobulin M in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Urinary microRNA-based signature improves accuracy of detection of clinically relevant prostate cancer within the prostate-specific antigen grey zone.', 'Prostate specific antigen: a critical assessment of the most useful tumor marker for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'Tumor-associated forms of prostate specific antigen improve the discrimination of prostate cancer from benign disease.']"""

Two-stage predictor substitution (2SPS) estimator and two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) are two commonly used approaches in applying instrumental variables. Recently, 2SPS was studied under the additive hazards model in the presence of competing risks of time-to-events data, where linearity was assumed for the relationship between the treatment and the instrument variable. This assumption may not be the most appropriate when we have binary treatments. In this paper, we consider the 2SRI estimator under the additive hazards model for general survival data and in the presence of competing risks, which allows generalized linear models for the relation between the treatment and the instrumental variable. We derive the asymptotic properties including a closed-form asymptotic variance estimate for the 2SRI estimator.

With the advent of SBRT with extreme hypo-fractionation in treating tumors including prostate where ablative dose is delivered in smaller number of fractions, rectum remains a dose-limiting organ and at the risk of rectal toxicity or secondary cancer. The same limitation of rectal toxicity exists for high-dose rate (HDR) treatments of cervical, endometrial, or prostate cancer when creating even a short distance between the anterior rectal wall and field of radiation is ideal in delivering ablative dose to the target. An effective solution to such problem is to physically displace rectum as the organ at risk. This research presents an organ retractor device that is designed to displace the rectum away from the path of radiation beam employing a Nitinol shape memory alloy that is designed for displacing the rectum upon actuation. A control system regulates the motion in a reproducible and safe manner by creating the desirable shape in moving the anterior rectal wall. The study finds the novel organ retractor device to be a promising tool that can be applied in a clinical setting for minimizing dose to the rectum during treatment of pelvic tumors, and creating the potential to deliver an ablative dose to tumor volume or to escalate the dose when needed.""","""['E Ishmael Parsai', 'Ahmadreza Jahadakbar', 'Hossein Lavvafi', 'Mohammad Elahinia']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Transperineal injection of hyaluronic acid in anterior perirectal fat to decrease rectal toxicity from radiation delivered with intensity modulated brachytherapy or EBRT for prostate cancer patients.', 'Dosimetric considerations to determine the optimal technique for localized prostate cancer among external photon, proton, or carbon-ion therapy and high-dose-rate or low-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'The influence of a rectal ultrasound probe on the separation between prostate and rectum in high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in a previously radiated patient with polyethylene glycol hydrogel spacing to reduce rectal dose: case report and review of the literature.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy strategies for pelvic tumors - a systematic review of clinical implementations.', 'Biomechanics of Additively Manufactured Metallic Scaffolds-A Review.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices in managing prostate motion: a\xa0systematic review.', 'Application of NiTi in Assistive and Rehabilitation Devices: A Review.']"""

An individual's degree of contact with the health care system, and, specifically, undergoing routine screening practices, may be a source of such bias. More intensive screening practices may be associated with increased diagnoses of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma.  Objective:   To assess a possible association between health care screening practices and skin cancer risk.  Design, setting, and participants:   The cohort of participants for this study was drawn from the Nurses' Health Study (121 700 women) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (51 529 men). Participants in the Nurses' Health Study were followed up from June 1, 1990, to June 1, 2012, and participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study were followed up from January 1, 1990, to January 1, 2012. Statistical analysis was performed from April 4, 2017, to May 16, 2018.  Exposures:   During cohort follow-up, Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study participants were asked whether they had undergone various health care screening practices including physical examination by a physician, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, eye examination, serum cholesterol test, mammography, breast examination and pelvic examination, and prostate-specific antigen test and rectal examination.  Main outcomes and measures:   Incident BCC, SCC, and invasive melanoma. Cases of SCC and melanoma were confirmed with histopathologic findings. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were calculated for the association between screening practices and the various types of skin cancer.  Results:   This study included 77 736 women from the Nurses' Health Study (mean [SD] age at baseline, 56 [7] years) who were followed up for 1 388 523 person-years and 39 756 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (mean [SD] age at baseline, 58 [10] years) who were followed up for 635 319 person-years. A total of 14 319 incident BCCs, 1517 SCCs, and 506 melanomas were identified in the Nurses' Health Study cohort and 8741 incident BCCs, 1191 SCCs, and 469 melanomas were identified in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohort. Positive associations were seen between various screening practices and diagnoses of BCC and SCC, with similar directions of associations seen with melanoma for some screening practices. In the Nurses' Health Study, the multivariable HR associated with undergoing a physical examination was 1.46 (95% CI, 1.30-1.64) for BCC, 2.32 (95% CI, 1.41-3.80) for SCC, and 1.66 (95% CI, 0.85-3.22) for melanoma. Similar results were seen in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, with a multivariable HR associated with undergoing a physical examination of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.26-1.63) for BCC and 1.85 (95% CI, 1.17-2.92) for SCC, with an attenuated HR for melanoma of 1.04 (95% CI, 0.64-1.69).  Conclusions and relevance:   Undergoing health care screening practices increases the likelihood of being diagnosed with skin cancer.

Protecting members of the public from radiation emanating from brachytherapy sources implanted in a patient was an issue several decades ago, but with modern brachytherapy, the problem has mostly disappeared. The most frequent treatments are either low-dose-rate permanent implants for prostate cancer, or high-dose-rate procedures for gynecological, breast, or skin cancers. Almost all current permanent implants use low-energy photon sources that are shielded by the patient. Similarly, some temporary implants, such as eye plaques that also use low-energy photon sources, incorporate a metallic shield into the applicator. All high-dose-rate brachytherapy takes place in a treatment vault, in a manner similar to external-beam radiotherapy, thus eliminating exposure to members of the public, in the absence of some terrible error or mistake. Modern brachytherapy techniques either eliminate or greatly reduce radiation exposures to the brachytherapy staff also. As noted above, high-dose-rate treatments take place in a heavily shielded vault, and staff remain outside the vault when the source is out of its shielded housing. For low-energy permanent implants, facilities often order the sources loaded into the implant needles by the vendor, reducing the time the procedure staff is exposed to the source. Often, the loaded needles can be shielded while awaiting implantation. Alternatively, individual sources may be placed using a special applicator that shields the staff. Radiation protection of the patient in many respects differs little from how it was decades ago except for greatly increased precision. Assaying the strength of a source of any kind is still essential. As important as verifying the source strength is ensuring that the source will be in the correct location for the desired time. Imaging serves as the main mechanism to guide the implantation and verify source or applicator position. Modern imaging has unveiled anatomy exquisitely and often permits definition of target disease and neighboring normal structures sufficiently to allow very conformal dose distributions. Despite these great advances and capabilities, errors and mistakes (together called failures) still occur. Failures in health care overall are the third leading cause of death in the United States. Most treatment failures result not from equipment problems but from procedures gone wrong. Attention to comprehensive commissioning of both equipment and procedures and risk-based development of quality management procedures helps protect the patient. Patient safety organizations, established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, work with client facilities to help identify weaknesses in both treatment procedures and quality management and to develop improvements to enhance protection.""","""['Bruce Thomadsen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Health Phys""","""['Radiation safety aspects of brachytherapy for prostate cancer using permanently implanted sources.

In the latter category, radioiodine therapy of thyroid cancer is the prototypical and most widely implemented radiopharmaceutical therapy. In the category of radionuclide-ligand conjugates, antibody and peptide conjugates have been studied extensively. The efficacy of radiopharmaceutical therapy relies on the ability to deliver cytotoxic radiation to tumor cells without causing prohibitive normal tissue toxicity. After some 30 y of preclinical and clinical research, a number of recent developments suggest that radiopharmaceutical therapy is poised to emerge as an important and widely recognized therapeutic modality. These developments include the substantial investment in antibodies by the pharmaceutical industry and the compelling rationale to build upon this already existing and widely tested platform. In addition, the growing recognition that the signaling pathways responsible for tumor cell survival and proliferation are less easily and durably inhibited than originally envisioned has also provided a rationale for identifying agents that are cytotoxic rather than inhibitory. A number of radiopharmaceutical agents are currently undergoing clinical trial investigation; these include beta-particle emitters, such as Lu, that are being used to label antisomatostatin receptor peptides for neuroendocrine cancers and also prostate-specific membrane antigen targeting small molecules for prostate cancer. Alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides have also been studied for radiopharmaceutical therapy; these include At for glioblastoma, Ac for leukemias and prostate cancer, Pb for breast cancer, and Ra for prostate cancer.

Reports suggest that argon plasma coagulation (APC) can be an effective therapy for CRP following radiotherapy for prostate cancer, but there is less information about how useful it is after radiotherapy for gynaecological malignancy. The aim of this work therefore was to study the efficacy of APC for CRP after radiotherapy for gynaecological malignancy.  Method:   This was a prospective study of consecutive patients with CRP following radiotherapy for gynaecological malignancy at IPGME&R, SDLD, Kolkata, India; symptoms included rectal bleeding grade (RBG) ≥ 2. APC was performed at monthly intervals to a maximum of four treatment sessions. Severity of disease at baseline was graded (endoscopically) by the total colonoscopic severity score (TCSS) and treatment response was assessed by reduction in RBG from ≥ 2 to ≤ 1 measured at > 6 months after cessation of APC.  Results:   Seventy patients [90% with cervical cancer, 10% with endometrial cancer; mean age 51.93 ± 9.15 years; median RBG 3 (range 2-4)] received APC. Seven patients died due to underlying malignancy and seven patients were lost to follow-up. Fifty-six (85.7%) patients responded to therapy after a median of 2 (range 1-4) treatment sessions. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a lower haemoglobin at the start of treatment predicted failure of therapy (P < 0.05).

Purpose/hypothesis:   To compare apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and Prostate Imaging and Data Reporting System (PI-RADS) v. 2 scores in intermediate risk (International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] Grade Group [GG] 2 and 3) PCa with/without IDC-P to determine if IDC-P alters the MRI appearance of PCa.  Study type:   Retrospective, case-control.  Population:   Fifteen consecutive men with ISUP GG 2/3 (Gleason score 3+4 = 7 [N = 4], 4+3 = 7 [N = 11]) PCa with IDC-P diagnosed at radical prostatectomy were compared with: 1) ISUP GG 2/3 PCa without IDC-P (matched for percentage Gleason pattern 4), and 2) ISUP GG 4 and 5 (Gleason score 8/9) PCa without IDC-P.  Field strength/sequence:   3T multiparametric MRI.  Assessment:   Two blinded radiologists (R1/R2) measured mean ADC, ADC.ratio (ADC.tumor/ADC.normal peripheral zone) and assigned PI-RADS v2 scores. Statistical Tests: Chi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA).  Results:   There were no differences in age, prostate serum antigen, tumor size, or stage between groups (P = 0.063-0.912). Tumors with IDC-P had lower mean ADC and ADC.ratio (0.741 ± 0.152 mm2 /sec and 0.44 ± 0.07) compared with ISUP GG 2/3 tumors without IDC-P (0.888 ± 0.167 mm2 /sec and 0.62 ± 0.14), P = 0.012 and <0.001; and did not differ compared with ISUP GG 4/5 tumors (0.705 ± 0.141 mm2 /sec and 0.44 ± 0.08), P = 0.509 and 0.868. Tumors with IDC-P were nearly all PI-RADS v2 score 5 (14/15) compared with ISUP GG 2/3 tumors without IDC-P (10/15 R1, 8/15 R2) and GG 4/5 tumors (9/15), (P = 0.040 = 0.092). Agreement in PI-RADS v2 scoring was moderate (K = 0.68).  Data conclusion:   ISUP GG 2 and 3 (intermediate risk, Gleason score 7) PCa with IDC-P have lower ADC compared with tumors without IDC-P with a similar percentage of Gleason pattern 4 and resemble ISUP GG 4 and 5 high risk tumors on MRI.

To develop focal salvage strategies, accurate tumor localization and distinction from benign tissue is necessary.  Purpose:   To quantitatively characterize radio-recurrent tumor and benign radiation-induced changes using mp-MRI, and investigate which sequences optimize the distinction between tumor and benign surroundings.  Study type:   Prospective case-control.  Subjects:   Thirty-three patients with biochemical failure after external-beam radiotherapy (cases), 35 patients without post-radiotherapy recurrent disease (controls), and 13 patients with primary PCa (untreated).  Field strength/sequences:   3T; quantitative mp-MRI: T2 -mapping, ADC, and Ktrans and kep maps.  Assessment:   Quantitative image-analysis of prostatic regions, within and between cases, controls, and untreated patients.  Statistical tests:   Within-groups: nonparametric Friedman analysis of variance with post-hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; between-groups: Mann-Whitney tests. All with Bonferroni corrections. Generalized linear mixed modeling to ascertain the contribution of each map and location to tumor likelihood.

After radiotherapy, benign central gland values were significantly decreased for all maps (P ≤ 0.001) as well as T2 , Ktrans , and kep of benign peripheral zone (all with P ≤ 0.002). All imaging maps distinguished recurrent tumor from benign peripheral zone, but only ADC, Ktrans , and kep were able to distinguish it from benign central gland. Recurrent tumor and peri-urethral Ktrans values were not significantly different (P = 0.81), but kep values were (P < 0.001).

The result raises the next question whether additional radiotherapy to metastatic sites could improve the survival in those with a low metastatic burden.  Methods:   We evaluated the efficacy and safety of prostate-directed radiotherapy (PDRT) with or without metastasis-directed radiotherapy (MDRT) in newly diagnosed oligometastatic patients who underwent combination of high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, and androgen deprivation therapy. Forty patients with bone metastasis and node positive prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed. Of these, 22 (55%), 3 (7%), and 15 (38%) patients had N1M0, M1a, and M1b, respectively. Eighteen patients (45%) received MDRT to all metastatic sites. All patients initially underwent ≧6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. Oligometastatic disease was defined as presence of five or fewer metastatic lesions. Median follow-up period was 62.5 months.  Results:   Of the 40 patients, the 5-year castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-free survival rate and cancer-specific survival was 64.4% and 87.9%, respectively. Pre- or post-treatment predictive value including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis ≥20 ng/mL, Gleason grade group 5, positive biopsy core rate ≥51%, PSA nadir level of ≥0.02 ng/mL after the radiotherapy, and no MDRT were significantly associated with progression to CRPC. Patients with MDRT had significantly higher probability of achieving a PSA level of <0.02 ng/mL than those without the therapy (88.8% vs 54.5%, P = 0.0354) and consequently had a better CRPC-free survival than those without the therapy (HR 0.319, 95%CI: 0.116-0.877). Comparing PDRT alone, PDRT with MDRT did not significantly increase the incidences of genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities.

Patients and methods:   A retrospective study with data from consecutive patients with suspected PCa seen in the urology department between November 2009 and April 2016 and who were candidates for prostate biopsy. A total of 1038 urine samples were tested in our laboratory with a kit that generated a PCA3 score (s-PCA3). A prostate biopsy was recommended only in those patients with s-PCA3≥35. Associations between variables were analyzed using the R software.  Results:   In patients with a positive s-PCA3 (44.5%), a subsequent biopsy was recommended. Of a total of 151 biopsies studied, 56.3% yielded a diagnosis of PCa. The probability of a positive biopsy increased as the s-PCA3 increased (p=0.041). The percentage of affected cylinders increased as the s-PCA3 increased (p=0.015). A statistically significant relationship was observed between s-PCA3 and both the Gleason score and the Grade Group (p=0.001 and 0.008, respectively). The best log-linear models and a logistic model confirmed the relationships shown previously with Fisher's exact tests.  Conclusions:   S-PCA3 may serve as an additional marker to reduce the indication for biopsies and avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment of patients with suspected PCa.

The PRIX nomogram is one such device; we compare the PRIX nomogram with the presence of secondary circulating prostate cells to predict those men who will undergo treatment failure. Methods and Patients: Men who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer entered the study. The PRIX score was calculated from the total serum PSA pre-surgery, the biopsy Gleason score and clinical stage. Circulating prostate cells were detected from venous blood one month after surgery, using differential gel centrifugation and standard immunocytochemistry with anti-PSA. A test was considered positive when 1 CPC/blood sample was detected. Patients were followed up for five years and biochemical failure was defined as a serum PSA >0.2ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional models were used to calculate survival curves. Results: 321 men participated, of whom 131 (40.8%) underwent biochemical failure within 5 years. A higher PRIX score was associated with increased failure risk, as was the presence of CPCs. The predictive power of CPCs was significantly higher than the PRIX score. Combining the two methods, for equal PRIX scores, scores but CPC positive had a worse biochemical failure free survival than men with high PRIX scores but CPC negative. For men with PRIX scores of ≥4 the use of CPC detection did not aid in the clinical decision making process. For those with PRIX scores of 0 and 1, CPC detection identified men with a high risk of treatment failure. Conclusions: The combined PRIX/CPC score improved the predictive values of men at high risk of biochemical failure. Both are simple systems that could be incorporated in a general hospital. Further multicenter studies are warranted to confirm these results.""","""['Nigel P Murray', 'Socrates Aedo', 'Cynthia Fuentealba', 'Eduardo Reyes', 'Omar Jacob']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Comparison of the Walz Nomogram and Presence of Secondary Circulating Prostate Cells for Predicting Early Biochemical Failure after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer in Chilean Men.', 'Does the Presence of Primary Circulating Prostate Cells Imply the Presence of Agressive Prostate Cancer with Early Biochemical Failure: a Comparison with the Walz Nomogram.', 'Prediction model for early biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy based on the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score and the presence of secondary circulating prostate cells.', 'Defining prostate cancer risk after radical prostatectomy.', 'Failure after radical prostatectomy.', 'Application of Primary/Secondary Circulating Tumor Cells for the Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence in Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer Patients following Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy: A Meta-Analysis.', 'The CAPRA score versus sub-types of minimal residual disease to predict biochemical failure after external beam radiotherapy.']"""

In MLR models, patient age represented an independent predictor of overall [odds ratio (OR): 1.02, p<0.001], intraoperative (OR: 1.03, p<0.001), cardiac (OR: 1.03, p<0.001), miscellaneous medical (OR: 1.02, p<0.001), miscellaneous surgical (OR: 1.01, p=0.01), pulmonary (OR: 1.02, p<0.001), and vascular complications (OR: 1.05, p<0.001); blood transfusions (OR: 1.02, p<0.001); and bowel obstruction (OR: 1.02, p<0.001). In MPR models, patient age was associated with longer stay (OR: 1.001, p=0.02). Similar results were recorded after adjustment for clustering in stratified analyses (<70 vs ≥70 yr) and in the subgroup of patients that underwent robotically assisted RP. For nine out of twelve examined outcomes, a virtually direct relationship existed with increasing age, in cubic spline analyses.  Conclusions:   Virtually all early postoperative RP complications are directly related to age. In consequence, these observations should be considered from an individual patient perspective as well as from a health management perspective.  Patient summary:   RP is provided through a wide patient age spectrum. Virtually all early postoperative RP complications are directly related to age. Individual patient's age needs to be considered in treatment decision-making.""","""['Felix Preisser', 'Elio Mazzone', 'Sebastiano Nazzani', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Zhe Tian', 'Philipp Mandel', 'Raisa Pompe', 'Fred Saad', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen', 'Derya Tilki', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['The Effect of Lymph Node Dissection in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: A Contemporary Analysis of Survival and Early Postoperative Outcomes.', 'Comparison of Open Versus Robotically Assisted Cytoreductive Radical Prostatectomy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy: results from the nationwide inpatient sample.', 'Comparison of Perioperative Outcomes Between Cytoreductive Radical Prostatectomy and Radical Prostatectomy for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Positive surgical margin and perioperative complication rates of primary surgical treatments for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing retropubic, laparoscopic, and robotic prostatectomy.', 'Effect of Early Postoperative Rehabilitation on Length of Hospital Stay after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Increased curative treatment is associated with decreased prostate cancer-specific and overall mortality in senior adults with high-risk prostate cancer; results from a national registry-based cohort study.', 'Salvage lymphadenectomy in recurrent prostate cancer: is there evidence of real benefit?']"""

Methods:   RE of 23 genes was analyzed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 37 freshly frozen samples of prostate cancer tissues of a different Gleason score (GS) and at various tumor stages, compared with RE in 37 paired conventionally normal prostate tissue (CNT) samples and 20 samples of prostate adenomas.  Results:   Differences in RE were shown for 11 genes out of 23 studied, when tumor samples were compared with corresponding CNTs. 7 genes, namely ACTA2, CXCL14, CTGF, THY1, FAP, CD163, CCL17 were upregulated in tumors. 4 genes, namely CCR4, NOS2A, MSMB, IL1R1 were downregulated in tumors. 14 genes demonstrated different RE in TNA at different stages: CXCL12, CXCL14, CTGF, FAP, HIF1A, THY1, CCL17, CCL22, CCR4, CD68, CD163, NOS2A, CTLA4, IL1R1. RE changes of 9 genes - CXCL12, CXCL14, HIF1A, CCR4, CCL17, NOS2A, CTLA4, IL1R1, IL2RA - were found in tumors with different GS. Moreover, 9 genes showed differences in RE in TNA, dependently on the presence or absence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion and 7 genes showed differences in RE of groups with differential PTEN expression. Significant correlations were calculated between RE of 9 genes in adenocarcinomas and the stage, and GS; also, between RE of 2 genes and the fusion presence; and between RE of 4 genes and PTEN expression.  Conclusions:   Several gene expression patterns were identified that correlated with the GS, stage and molecular characteristics of tumors, i.e. presence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion and alterations in PTEN expression. These expression patterns can be used for molecular profiling of prostate tumors, with the aim to develop personalized medicine approaches.

Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been proposed to be implicated in dormancy of cancer cells. However, how these tumor cells are kept dormant and recur under control of Wnt/β-catenin signaling derived from bone microenvironment remains unknown. Here, we report that Wnt5a from osteoblastic niche induces dormancy of PCa cells in a reversible manner in vitro and in vivo via inducing Siah E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 2 (SIAH2) expression, which represses Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, this effect of Wnt5a-induced dormancy of PCa cells depends on receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2), and a negative correlation of ROR2 expression with bone metastasis-free survival is observed in PCa patients. Therefore, these results demonstrate that Wnt5a/ROR2/SIAH2 signaling axis plays a crucial role in inducing and maintaining PCa cells dormancy in bone, suggesting a potential therapeutic utility of Wnt5a via inducing dormancy of PCa cells in bone.""","""['Dong Ren', 'Yuhu Dai', 'Qing Yang', 'Xin Zhang', 'Wei Guo', 'Liping Ye', 'Shuai Huang', 'Xu Chen', 'Yingrong Lai', 'Hong Du', 'Chuyong Lin', 'Xinsheng Peng', 'Libing Song']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Exp Med""","""['Wnt5a suppresses osteoblastic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cell-like cells via Ror2/JNK signaling.', 'Wnt5a mediated canonical Wnt signaling pathway activation in orthodontic tooth movement: possible role in the tension force-induced bone formation.', 'The Wnt5a/Ror2 noncanonical signaling pathway inhibits canonical Wnt signaling in K562 cells.', 'Insight into the role of Wnt5a-induced signaling in normal and cancer cells.', 'Cell/tissue-tropic functions of Wnt5a signaling in normal and cancer cells.', 'SNHG1 opposes quiescence and promotes docetaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer.', 'The covert symphony: cellular and molecular accomplices in breast cancer metastasis.', 'Epigenetic Modifications in Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Microenvironment.', 'BHLHE22 drives the immunosuppressive bone tumor microenvironment and associated bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Involvement of redox signalling in tumour cell dormancy and metastasis.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed medical records of incidental prostate cancer patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy. Patients whose tumor statuses were further confirmed by prostate biopsy, or who had used androgen deprivation therapy before radical prostatectomy, were excluded. Clinical and pathological parameters were analyzed to evaluate residual tumor and clinical prognosis. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, as well as receiver operator characteristics, to predict residual tumor (pT0).  Results:   The final analysis included 95 patients. Among these patients, 67 (70.53%) exhibited residual tumor, whereas 28 (29.47%) did not (pT0). Pathology findings showed that 44 (65.67%), 16 (23.88%), and 7 patients (10.45%) exhibited Gleason scores of G6, G7, and ≥G8, respectively. Fifty-seven and 10 patients exhibited pathologic T stages T2 and T3, respectively. Mean follow-up duration was 70.26 (±34.67) months. Biochemical recurrence was observed in 11 patients; none were pT0 patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that low prostate-specific antigen density after benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery and invisible lesion on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging were significantly associated with pT0. Additionally, a combination of these factors showed an increase in the diagnostic accuracy of pT0, compared with mpMRI alone (AUC 0.805, 0.767, respectively); this combination showed sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of 71.6%, 89.3%, and 94.1%, respectively.

Methods:   A previously proposed fluence map optimization algorithm called fast inverse dose optimization (FIDO) was extended to optimize the aperture shapes and weights of IMRT beams. FIDO is a very fast fluence map optimization algorithm for IMRT that finds the global minimum using direct matrix inversion without unphysical negative beam weights. In this study, an equivalent second-order Taylor series expansion of the FIDO objective function was used, which allowed for the objective function value and gradient vector to be computed very efficiently during direct aperture optimization, resulting in faster optimization. To evaluate the speed gained with FIDAO, a proof-of-concept algorithm was developed in MATLAB using an interior-point optimization method to solve the reformulated aperture-based FIDO problem. The FIDAO algorithm was used to optimize four step-and-shoot IMRT cases: on the AAPM TG-119 phantom as well as a liver, prostate, and head-and-neck clinical cases. Results were compared with a conventional DAO algorithm that uses the same interior-point method but using the standard formulation of the objective function and its gradient vector.  Results:   A substantial gain in optimization speed was obtained with the prototype FIDAO algorithm compared to the conventional DAO algorithm while producing plans of similar quality. The optimization time (number of iterations) for the prototype FIDAO algorithm vs the conventional DAO algorithm was 0.3 s (17) vs 56.7 s (50); 2.0 s (28) vs 134.1 s (57); 2.5 s (26) vs 180.6 s (107); and 6.7 s (20) vs 469.4 s (482) in the TG-119 phantom, liver, prostate, and head-and-neck examples, respectively.  Conclusions:   A new direct aperture optimization algorithm based on FIDO was developed. For the four IMRT test cases examined, this algorithm executed approximately 70-200 times faster without compromising the IMRT plan quality.""","""['Michael MacFarlane', 'Douglas A Hoover', 'Eugene Wong', 'Pedro Goldman', 'Jerry J Battista', 'Jeff Z Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Technical Note: A fast inverse direct aperture optimization algorithm for volumetric-modulated arc therapy.', 'Feasibility of a fast inverse dose optimization algorithm for IMRT via matrix inversion without negative beamlet intensities.', 'A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Direct aperture optimization as a means of reducing the complexity of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy plans.', 'Radiation therapy to the head and neck.

Nonadherence to offered cancer screening tests may be associated with mortality among middle-aged and older adults.  Objective:   To evaluate the association between nonadherence to cancer screening tests and mortality in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening trial, excluding mortality from cancers studied in the trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   Randomization at 10 US screening centers occurred from November 8, 1993, to July 2, 2001. Original follow-up was through 13 years or December 31, 2009. Participants were re-consented to further follow-up starting May 18, 2011, and were observed until December 31, 2012. Protocol screening tests for the PLCO Cancer Screening trial intervention arm participants (N = 77 443) included chest radiographs and flexible sigmoidoscopy for both sexes, prostate-specific antigen tests and digital rectal examinations for men, and cancer antigen 125 tests and transvaginal ultrasonography for women. At baseline, participants completed a self-administered questionnaire. The cohort was classified into those receiving all sex-specified PLCO Cancer Screening trial screening tests at baseline (fully adherent), those receiving some but not all baseline tests (partially adherent), and those receiving no baseline tests (nonadherents). Secondary analysis was ad hoc in the original trial protocol. Statistical analysis was conducted from November 24, 2017, to August 29, 2018.  Main outcomes and measures:   Mortality was ascertained via mailed annual study update questionnaires and searches of the National Death Index. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the association between mortality and adherence, controlling for various covariates.  Results:   Of 77 443 participants in the intervention arm, 64 567 (29 537 women and 35 030 men; mean [SD] age, 62.3 [5.3] years) were included in the analysis based on consenting to trial participation before randomization and being eligible for all screening tests. Overall, 55 065 participants (85.3%) were adherent, 2548 (3.9%) were partially adherent, and 6954 (10.8%) were nonadherent with the baseline screening protocol. Within 10 years of follow-up, the hazard ratio of mortality, excluding deaths from cancers studied in the PLCO Cancer Screening trial and controlling only for age, sex, and race/ethnicity (model 1), was 1.73 (95% CI, 1.60-1.89) for nonadherent compared with fully adherent participants and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.19-1.54) for partially compared with fully adherent participants. After adjustment for medical risk factors for mortality and behavioral-related factors (model 2), the hazard ratio decreased to 1.46 (95% CI, 1.34-1.59) for nonadherent compared with fully adherent participants.  Conclusions and relevance:   Among participants in a screening trial for multiple cancers, a nonadherence behavior profile marked by nonadherence to protocol screenings was associated with higher overall mortality (excluding deaths from cancers studied in the trial). The generalizability of this finding to routine clinical practice should be assessed.

Protein expression levels of the signaling components checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), protein kinase B (AKT), phosphorylated (p)‑CHK2 and p‑AKT were measured by western blotting. The results demonstrated that PRNCR1‑2 expression was significantly elevated in breast cancer tissues compared with in adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, depletion of PRNCR1‑2 in HS‑578T and MDA‑MB‑231 breast cancer cells markedly suppressed their proliferation rates, migration and invasion capacities, and cell cycle progression; however, it had no effect on cell apoptosis. In addition, PRNCR1‑2 depletion increased CHK2 phosphorylation and decreased AKT phosphorylation in HS‑578T and MDA‑MB‑231 cells.

To evaluate robustness of the hybrid DIR for prostate cancer patients with organs with volume that vary on a daily basis, such as the bladder and rectum, the DIR algorithms were performed on ten pairs of CT volumes from ten patients who underwent prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy. In a visual evaluation, MIM caused unrealistic image deformation in soft tissues, organs, and pelvic bones. The mean dice similarity coefficient (DSC) ranged from 0.46 to 0.90 for the prostate, bladder, rectum, and SVs; the SVs had the lowest DSC. Target registration error (TRE) at the centroid of the ROIs was about 2 mm for the prostate and bladder, and about 6 mm for the rectum and SVs. RayStation did not cause unrealistic image deformation, and could maintain the shape of pelvic bones in most cases. The mean DSC and TRE at the centroid of the ROIs were about 0.9 and within 5 mm generally.

Metastasis-associated with lung adenocarcinoma transcript-1 (MALAT1), which is overexpressed in PCa tissue, is associated with physiological and pathological conditions of PCa. M2 macrophages are major immune cells abundant in the tumor microenvironment. However, it remains unknown whether M2 macrophages are involved in the effects or not, and molecular mechanisms of MALAT1 on PCa progression have not yet been comprehensively explored. Here we reported that, M2 macrophages (PMA/IL-4 treated THP1) induced MALAT1 expression in PCa cell lines. Knockdown MALAT1 expression level in PCa cell lines inhibited cellular proliferation, invasion, and tumor formation. Further mechanistic dissection revealed that M2 macrophages secreted IL-8 was sufficient to drive up MALAT1 expression level via activating STAT3 signaling pathway. Additional chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays displayed that STAT3 could bind to the MALAT1 promoter region and transcriptionally stimulate the MALAT1 expression. In summary, our present study identified the IL-8/STAT3/MALAT1 axis as key regulators during prostate tumorigenesis and therefore demonstrated a new mechanism for the MALAT1 transcriptional regulation.""","""['Tingjin Zheng', 'Guoxing Ma', 'Mingqing Tang', 'Zhongwan Li', 'Ruian Xu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['TGF-β-induced STAT3 overexpression promotes human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma invasion and metastasis through malat1/miR-30a interactions.', 'MALAT1 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'LncRNA MALAT1 promotes proliferation and metastasis in epithelial ovarian cancer via the PI3K-AKT pathway.', 'Long non‑coding RNA MALAT1 correlates with cell viability and mobility by targeting miR‑22‑3p in renal cell carcinoma via the PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Relationship between long non-coding RNA MALAT1 and prostate cancer.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'IL-8 Produced Via Bidirectional Communication Between Prostate Cancer and M2 Macrophages as a Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker.', 'Phytochemistry and pharmacology of natural prenylated flavonoids.', 'Regulation of the Inflammatory Response, Proliferation, Migration, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Human Lens Epithelial Cells by the lncRNA-MALAT1/miR-26a-5p/TET1 Signaling Axis.', 'The role of lncRNAs in the tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy of melanoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study examined the records of newly-diagnosed prostate cancer subjects receiving ADT only in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database in the years between 2001 and 2007. As controls men without cancer were selected and divided into three groups, 1) benign prostate hyperplasia treated with an alpha-blocker (BPH-alpha blocker), 2) BPH treated with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (BPH-5ARI) and 3) healthy controls. OAB events were censored by definition of drug prescriptions for more than one month and risk analysis among each group was performed.  Results:   The healthy control group had decreased risk of OAB compared to the prostate cancer group and the BPH-5ARI group showed a higher risk of OAB than the prostate cancer group. Subgroup analysis showed that independently of age or comorbidities, the prevalence of OAB was significantly lower in the healthy control group. Moreover, the cumulative incidence of OAB showed a time-dependent pattern with a significant increase after ADT for 5 years.  Conclusion:   Androgen deprivation in prostate cancer patients was associated with an increased risk of OAB that was treatment duration-dependent.

They can either reduce tumor growth by secreting antitumorigenic factors or promote tumor progression by secreting a variety of soluble factors. The purpose of this study was to define the monocyte/macrophage population prevalent in skeletal tumors, explore a mechanism employed in supporting prostate cancer (PCa) skeletal metastasis, and examine a novel therapeutic target. Phagocytic CD68+ cells were found to correlate with Gleason score in human PCa samples, and M2-like macrophages (F4/80+CD206+) were identified in PCa bone resident tumors in mice. Induced M2-like macrophages in vitro were more proficient at phagocytosis (efferocytosis) of apoptotic tumor cells than M1-like macrophages. Moreover, soluble factors released from efferocytic versus nonefferocytic macrophages increased PC-3 prostate cancer cell numbers in vitro. Trabectedin exposure reduced M2-like (F4/80+CD206+) macrophages in vivo. Trabectedin administration after PC-3 cell intracardiac inoculation reduced skeletal metastatic tumor growth. Preventative pretreatment with trabectedin 7 days prior to PC-3 cell injection resulted in reduced M2-like macrophages in the marrow and reduced skeletal tumor size. Together, these findings suggest that M2-like monocytes and macrophages promote PCa skeletal metastasis and that trabectedin represents a candidate therapeutic target.""","""['J D Jones', 'B P Sinder', 'D Paige', 'F N Soki', 'A J Koh', 'S Thiele', 'Y Shiozawa', 'L C Hofbauer', 'S Daignault', 'H Roca', 'L K McCauley']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Bone Mass Is Compromised by the Chemotherapeutic Trabectedin in Association With Effects on Osteoblasts and Macrophage Efferocytosis.', 'Polarization of prostate cancer-associated macrophages is induced by milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E8)-mediated efferocytosis.', 'CD169(+) macrophages mediate pathological formation of woven bone in skeletal lesions of prostate cancer.', 'Somatostatin Derivate (smsDX) Attenuates the TAM-Stimulated Proliferation, Migration and Invasion of Prostate Cancer via NF-κB Regulation.', 'A Review of Preclinical Experiments Toward Targeting M2 Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pulsatilla Saponins Inhibit Experimental Lung Metastasis of Melanoma via Targeting STAT6-Mediated M2 Macrophages Polarization.', 'The tumor innate immune microenvironment in prostate cancer: an overview of soluble factors and cellular effectors.', ""Consecutive Inhibition of Telomerase and Alternative Lengthening Pathway Promotes Hodgkin's Lymphoma Cell Death."", 'The Roles of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.', 'Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and its related signaling pathways in the regulation of tumor-associated macrophages polarization.']"""

Objective:   To assess patient-reported HRQoL, depression symptoms, and cognitive function for abiraterone versus enzalutamide.  Design, setting, and participants:   We randomized 202 patients in a phase II study of abiraterone versus enzalutamide for first-line treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02125357).  Intervention:   Patients completed Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) questionnaires, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) cognitive assessments at baseline and on treatment.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   To compare the change in FACT-P scores over time between treatment arms, we used a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). For FACT-P domains where there was an interaction between the treatment arm and age, we constructed separate models for patients aged <75 and ≥75yr. We compared the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful change from baseline for FACT-P, and the proportion of patients with an abnormal score and median change from baseline for PHQ-9 and MoCA using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test.  Results and limitations:   In the MMRM analysis, there was a positive test for interaction in the treatment arm by age for total FACT-P (p=0.048). FACT-P change from baseline over time was better for abiraterone than for enzalutamide in the ≥75-yr model (p=0.003), with no difference in the <75-yr model (p>0.9). A higher proportion of patients experienced clinically meaningful worsening with enzalutamide for the physical and functional well-being domains (37% vs 21%, p=0.013; 39% vs 23%, p=0.015). The distribution of change in PHQ-9 scores from baseline favored abiraterone at weeks 4, 8, and 12. These analyses were not prespecified, and results should be considered to be hypothesis generating.  Conclusions:   Patient-reported outcomes favored abiraterone compared with enzalutamide with differences in FACT-P HRQoL and PHQ-9 depression scores. Differences in the total FACT-P scores were seen only in the elderly patient subgroup.  Patient summary:   In this report, we examined the change in patient-reported quality-of-life scores from the start of treatment over time for patients treated with abiraterone versus enzalutamide for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Importantly these assays must be analytically robust in order to provide quality data for important clinical decisions. DNA microarray based gene expression assays measure several analytes simultaneously and can present specific challenges to analytical validation. This study describes the analytical validation of one such assay designed to predict metastatic recurrence in prostate cancer using primary formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumour material.  Methods:   Accuracy was evaluated with a method comparison study between the assay development platform (Prostate Disease Specific Array) and an alternative platform (Xcel™ microarray) using 50 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate cancer patient samples. An additional 70 samples were used to establish the assay reportable range. Determination of assay precision and sensitivity was performed on multiple technical replicates of three prostate cancer samples across multiple variables (operators, days, runs, reagent lots, and equipment) and RNA/cDNA inputs respectively using the appropriate linear mixed model.  Results:   The overall agreement between the development and alternative platform was 94.7% (95% confidence interval, 86.9-98.5%). The reportable range was determined to be 0.150 to 1.107 for core needle biopsy samples and - 0.214 to 0.844 for radical prostatectomy samples. From the precision study, the standard deviations for assay repeatability and reproducibility were 0.032 and 0.040 respectively. The sensitivity study demonstrated that a total RNA input and cDNA input of 50 ng and 3.5 μg respectively was conservative.  Conclusion:   The Metastatic Assay was found to be highly reproducible and precise. In conclusion the studies demonstrated an acceptable analytical performance for the assay and support its potential use in the clinic.""","""['Paul Wallace Medlow', 'Christopher James Steele', 'Andrena Marie McCavigan', 'Wesley Reardon', 'Christopher Michael Brown', 'Shauna May Lambe', 'Felipe Augusto Andre Ishiy', 'Steven Michael Walker', 'Gemma Elizabeth Logan', 'Olaide Yaqeen Raji', 'Viktor Berge', 'Betina Katz', 'Elaine Williamson Kay', 'Katherine Sheehan', 'Ronald William Watson', 'Denis Paul Harkin', 'Richard Darragh Kennedy', 'Laura Anne Knight']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['Analytical validation of the Oncotype DX prostate cancer assay - a clinical RT-PCR assay optimized for prostate needle biopsies.', 'Analytical performance of a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue-based 634-probe prognostic assay for predicting outcome of patients with stage II colon cancer.', 'Patient-Level DNA Damage and Repair Pathway Profiles and Prognosis After Prostatectomy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiplex quantitative measurement of mRNAs from fixed tissue microarray sections.', 'Evaluating Robustness and Sensitivity of the NanoString Technologies nCounter Platform to Enable Multiplexed Gene Expression Analysis of Clinical Samples.']"""

Current experimental models used to study CaP are not well suited to address this issue. Previously, we have described the hormonal progression of non-tumorigenic human prostate epithelial cells (BPH1) into malignant cells via tissue recombination. Here, we describe a method to derive human cell lines from distinct stages of CaP that parallel cellular, genetic and epigenetic changes found in patients with cancers. This BPH1-derived Cancer Progression (BCaP) model represents different stages of cancer. Using diverse analytical strategies, we show that the BCaP model reproduces molecular characteristics of CaP in human patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BCaP cells have altered gene expression of shared pathways with human and transgenic mouse CaP data, as well as, increasing genomic instability with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in advanced tumor cells. Together, these cell lines represent a unique model of human CaP progression providing a novel tool that will allow the discovery and experimental validation of mechanisms regulating human CaP development and progression.

Materials and methods:   Five thousand one hundred eighty-nine men with prostate cancer and 6,152 controls were genotyped for four recurrent variants of NBN (657del5, R215W, I171V, and E185Q).  Results:   The NBN 657del5 mutation was detected in 74 of 5,189 unselected cases and in 35 of 6,152 controls (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; p < 0.001). In carriers of 657del5 deletion, the cancer risk was restricted to men with the GG genotype of the E185Q variant of the same gene. Among men with the GG genotype, the OR associated with 657del5 was 4.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4 to 8.0). Among men with other E185Q genotypes, the OR associated with 657del5 was 1.4 (95% CI, 0.8 to 2.4) and the interaction was significant (homogeneity p=0.006). After a median follow-up of 109 months, mortality was worse for 657del5 mutation carriers than for non-carriers (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; p=0.001). The adverse effect of 657del5 on survival was only seen on the background of the GG genotype of E185Q (HR, 1.9; p=0.0004).  Conclusion:   The NBN 657del5 mutation predisposes to poor prognosis prostate cancer. The pathogenicity of this mutation, with regards to both prostate cancer risk and survival, is modified by a missense variant of the same gene (E185Q).""","""['Bogna Rusak', 'Wojciech Kluźniak', 'Dominika Wokołorczykv', 'Klaudia Stempa', 'Aniruddh Kashyap', 'Jacek Gronwald', 'Tomasz Huzarski', 'Tadeusz Dębniak', 'Anna Jakubowska', 'Bartłomiej Masojć', 'Mohammad R Akbari', 'Steven A Narodv', 'Jan Lubiński', 'Cezary Cybulski']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Res Treat""","""['Allelic modification of breast cancer risk in women with an NBN mutation.', 'An inherited NBN mutation is associated with poor prognosis prostate cancer.', 'Role of the Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 gene in familial and sporadic prostate cancer.', 'Cancer risk of heterozygotes with the NBN founder mutation.', 'Detecting Variants in the NBN Gene While Testing for Hereditary Breast Cancer: What to Do Next?', 'Large Cancer Pedigree Involving Multiple Cancer Genes including Likely Digenic MSH2 and MSH6 Lynch Syndrome (LS) and an Instance of Recombinational Rescue from LS.', 'Prognostic Role of DNA Damage Response Genes Mutations and their Association With the Sensitivity of Olaparib in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Clinical Significance of Gene Mutations and Polymorphic Variants and their Association with Prostate Cancer Risk in Polish Men.', 'NBS1 I171V variant underlies individual differences in chromosomal radiosensitivity within human populations.', 'Mechanisms of Macrophage Plasticity in the Tumor Environment: Manipulating Activation State to Improve Outcomes.']"""

Objective:   To define the prevalence of MSI-H/dMMR prostate cancer and the clinical benefit of anti-PD-1/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy in this molecularly defined population.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this case series, 1551 tumors from 1346 patients with prostate cancer undergoing treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were prospectively analyzed using a targeted sequencing assay from January 1, 2015, through January 31, 2018. Patients had a diagnosis of prostate cancer and consented to tumor molecular profiling when a tumor biopsy was planned or archival tissue was available. For each patient, clinical outcomes were reported, with follow-up until May 31, 2018.  Main outcomes and measures:   Tumor mutation burden and MSIsensor score, a quantitative measure of MSI, were calculated. Mutational signature analysis and immunohistochemistry for MMR protein expression were performed in select cases.  Results:   Among the 1033 patients who had adequate tumor quality for MSIsensor analysis (mean [SD] age, 65.6 [9.3] years), 32 (3.1%) had MSI-H/dMMR prostate cancer. Twenty-three of 1033 patients (2.2%) had tumors with high MSIsensor scores, and an additional 9 had indeterminate scores with evidence of dMMR. Seven of the 32 MSI-H/dMMR patients (21.9%) had a pathogenic germline mutation in a Lynch syndrome-associated gene. Six patients had more than 1 tumor analyzed, 2 of whom displayed an acquired MSI-H phenotype later in their disease course. Eleven patients with MSI-H/dMMR castration-resistant prostate cancer received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Six of these (54.5%) had a greater than 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen levels, 4 of whom had radiographic responses. As of May 2018, 5 of the 6 responders (5 of 11 total [45.5%]) were still on therapy for as long as 89 weeks.  Conclusions and relevance:   The MSI-H/dMMR molecular phenotype is uncommon yet therapeutically meaningful in prostate cancer and can be somatically acquired during disease evolution. Given the potential for durable responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, these findings support the use of prospective tumor sequencing to screen all patients with advanced prostate cancer for MSI-H/dMMR. Because not all patients with the MSI-H/dMMR phenotype respond, further studies should explore mechanisms of resistance.""","""['Wassim Abida', 'Michael L Cheng', 'Joshua Armenia', 'Sumit Middha', 'Karen A Autio', 'Hebert Alberto Vargas', 'Dana Rathkopf', 'Michael J Morris', 'Daniel C Danila', 'Susan F Slovin', 'Emily Carbone', 'Ethan S Barnett', 'Melanie Hullings', 'Jaclyn F Hechtman', 'Ahmet Zehir', 'Jinru Shia', 'Philip Jonsson', 'Zsofia K Stadler', 'Preethi Srinivasan', 'Vincent P Laudone', 'Victor Reuter', 'Jedd D Wolchok', 'Nicholas D Socci', 'Barry S Taylor', 'Michael F Berger', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Charles L Sawyers', 'Nikolaus Schultz', 'David B Solit', 'Anuradha Gopalan', 'Howard I Scher']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Microsatellite Instability as an Emerging Biomarker for Checkpoint Inhibitor Response in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'ESMO recommendations on microsatellite instability testing for immunotherapy in cancer, and its relationship with PD-1/PD-L1 expression and tumour mutational burden: a systematic review-based approach.', 'Association of Primary Resistance to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer With Misdiagnosis of Microsatellite Instability or Mismatch Repair Deficiency Status.', 'Prevalence of PDL1 Amplification and Preliminary Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Solid Tumors.', 'Why is immunotherapy effective (or not) in patients with MSI/MMRD tumors?', 'Is There a Role for Programmed Death Ligand-1 Testing and Immunotherapy in Colorectal Cancer With Microsatellite Instability?

Assessment:   Regions of interest were drawn on ADC maps and T2 -weighted images around focal lesions in areas of biopsy-positive prostate cancer and in nonmalignant areas of untreated and irradiated peripheral zone (PZ), and untreated transitional zone (TZ). Multiecho T2 data were fitted with mono-/biexponential decay and nonnegative least squares functions. The luminal water fraction (LWF) was derived.  Statistical tests:   The preference between mono- and biexponential decay was assessed using the Bayesian information criterion. Differences in fitted parameters between tissue types were compared (paired t-test within groups, Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum test between groups) and correlations between ADC and T2 components assessed (Spearman rank correlation test).  Results:   LWF in tumor (0.09) was significantly lower than in PZ or TZ (0.27 and 0.18, P < 0.01, respectively), but tumor values were comparable to nonmalignant irradiated prostate (0.08). The short T2 relaxation rate was lower in tumor than in nonmalignant untreated or irradiated tissue (significant compared with TZ, P = 0.01). There was a strong correlation between LWF and ADC in normal untreated tissue (r = 0.88, P < 0.001). This relationship was absent in nonmalignant irradiated prostrate (r = -0.35, P = 0.42) and in tumor (r = -0.04, P = 0.88).  Data conclusion:   T2 components in conjunction with ADC can be used to characterize untreated and irradiated nonmalignant prostate and tumor. LWF is most useful at discriminating tumor in the untreated prostate.  Level of evidence:   2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. Magn. Reson.

It has the advantages of providing a high dose of treatment to the target sites and low dose to normal tissues. It has been mostly applied as palliative treatment for recurrences in advanced malignant tumor (except for prostate cancer), suppressing tumor development and improving the quality of life of patients.  Objective:   The objective of this study was to investigate changes in quality of life for patients with advanced malignant tumor after receiving I-125 seed implantation using a three-dimensional (3D)-printed individualized template and computed tomography (CT) guidance.  Materials and methods:   In this prospective study, convenience sampling was applied for patients with advanced tumors attending a tertiary hospital. The European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 was involved to assess quality of life. Patients completed the questionnaire before and 24 h after seed implantation. The questionnaire of 1 and 3 months after seed implantation was completed by telephonic follow-up.  Results:   A total of 42 patients were included (24 males and 18 females), with an average age of 58.86 ± 14.13 years (ranged 25-91 years). The average scale score after seed implantation was higher than that of before implantation. The order was the average scale score 1 month after seed implantation >3 months after seed implantation >24 h after seed implantation.

Human and murine prostate cancer cell lines were used to examine the response to ADT and RT in vitro and in vivo. Biological changes following treatment and related immune modulation in the tumor microenvironment were examined. Our results showed that CRPC cells were demonstrated to be more resistant to the RT and ADT treatments. ADT increased tumor inhibition following irradiation. The underlying changes included increased cell death, attenuated myeloid-derived suppressor cell recruitment, and an increase in the number of tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs). Furthermore, when high-dose fractionated RT was given to the primary CRPC tumor, a smaller size of secondary non-irradiated tumor associated with increased TILs was noted in ADT-treated mice. In conclusion, treatment resistance in CRPC was associated with a more immunosuppressive microenvironment. Enhanced antitumor immunity was responsible for the augmented RT-induced tumoricidal effect induced by ADT.

The present study intended to investigate the efficacy of the combination of MET and VPA in prostate cancer treatment in a pre-clinical xenograft model.  Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC-3) were inoculated under the skin of BALB/c nude mice. The mice were treated with 200 μl/ml MET and/or 0.4% (w/v) VPA diluted in drinking water, or with vehicle control, and were monitored until the tumor volume reached 2,000 mm3 Evaluation of toxicity of the drug combination was determined in liver and kidney by histology.  Results:   In both LNCaP and PC-3 xenografts, MET combined with VPA significantly reduced tumor growth during the first 4 weeks following treatment, and delayed the time-to-tumor volume of 2,000 mm3 by 90 days, as compared to MET or to VPA alone, and to vehicle control. There was no significant difference in total mouse weight, liver or kidney morphology in response to combination treatment (MET+VPA) compared to MET or VPA alone and vehicle control.  Conclusion:   The combination treatment of MET with VPA is more effective at slowing prostate tumor growth in vivo compared to either drug alone, in mouse xenografts.

MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) has been characterized in some tumor entities as anti-angiogenic, but this has not yet been investigated in PC.  Materials and methods:   PC cells stably overexpressing miR-1 (LNCaP-miR-1) were incubated on an in vivo hen's egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) model and compared to maternal LNCaP cells. Cell growth, blood vessel organisation, and total blood vessel area were analysed.  Results:   Both matrigel-embedded LNCaP and LNCaP-miR-1 cells formed compact tumor-like cell aggregates on the CAM of the HET-CAM model. Although not quantifiable, bleeding of the CAM and remodelling of the blood vessel network in the CAM indicated an influence of miR-1 on the vascular system. The statistically significant decrease in the total surface area of blood vessels in the visible CAM section to 79.4% of control cells demonstrated the antiangiogenic properties of miR-1 for the first time.  Conclusion:   MiR-1 had a tumor-suppressive and anti-angiogenic effect in an in vivo PC model.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism and pathobiology of SPINK1 in prostate cancer remains largely unknown.  Experimental design:   miRNA prediction tools were employed to examine the SPINK1-3'UTR for miRNA binding. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to confirm the SPINK1-3'UTR binding of shortlisted miR-338-5p/miR-421. Furthermore, miR-338-5p/-421-overexpressing cancer cells (SPINK1-positive) were evaluated for oncogenic properties using cell-based functional assays and a mouse xenograft model. Global gene expression profiling was performed to unravel the biological pathways altered by miR-338-5p/-421. IHC and RNA in situ hybridization were carried out on prostate cancer patients' tissue microarray for SPINK1 and EZH2 expression, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to examine EZH2 occupancy on the miR-338-5p/-421-regulatory regions. Bisulfite sequencing and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation were performed on prostate cancer cell lines and patients' specimens.  Results:   We established a critical role of miRNA-338-5p/-421 in posttranscriptional regulation of SPINK1. Ectopic expression of miRNA-338-5p/-421 in SPINK1-positive cells abrogates oncogenic properties including cell-cycle progression, stemness, and drug resistance, and shows reduced tumor burden and distant metastases in a mouse model. Importantly, we show that patients with SPINK1-positive prostate cancer exhibit increased EZH2 expression, suggesting its role in epigenetic silencing of miRNA-338-5p/-421. Furthermore, presence of CpG dinucleotide DNA methylation marks on the regulatory regions of miR-338-5p/-421 in SPINK1-positive prostate cancer cells and patients' specimens confirms epigenetic silencing.  Conclusions:   Our findings revealed that miRNA-338-5p/-421 are epigenetically silenced in SPINK1-positive prostate cancer, although restoring the expression of these miRNAs using epigenetic drugs or synthetic mimics could abrogate SPINK1-mediated oncogenesis.See related commentary by Bjartell, p. 2679.""","""['Vipul Bhatia#', 'Anjali Yadav#', 'Ritika Tiwari', 'Shivansh Nigam', 'Sakshi Goel', 'Shannon Carskadon', 'Nilesh Gupta', 'Apul Goel', 'Nallasivam Palanisamy', 'Bushra Ateeq']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['New Hope in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine? miRNA Replacement and Epigenetics.', 'miR-5089-5p suppresses castration-resistant prostate cancer resistance to enzalutamide and metastasis via miR-5089-5p/SPINK1/ MAPK/MMP9 signaling.', 'miR-421 up-regulation by the oleanolic acid derivative K73-03 regulates epigenetically SPINK1 transcription in pancreatic cancer cells leading to metabolic changes and enhanced apoptosis.', 'New Hope in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine? miRNA Replacement and Epigenetics.', 'Molecular Underpinnings Governing Genetic Complexity of ETS-Fusion-Negative Prostate Cancer.', 'SPINKs in Tumors: Potential Therapeutic Targets.', 'NPAS2 promotes aerobic glycolysis and tumor growth in prostate cancer through HIF-1A signaling.', 'CircDHRS3 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the circDHRS3/miR-421/MEIS2 axis.', 'Cancer Stem Cells-The Insight into Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and radiation resistance in rectal cancer patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy: a potential target for precision medicine.', ""Elucidating miRNA Function in Cancer Biology via the Molecular Genetics' Toolbox.""]"""

Here, we explored interactions between prostate cancer and muscle cells that surround the prostate. We found that coculturing of prostate cancer cells with skeletal or smooth muscle cells expands the subpopulations of cancer cells with features characteristic of cancer stem-like cells, including anchorage-independent growth, elevated CD133 expression, and drug resistance. These changes in the properties of cancer cells depend on: (i) the muscle cell-induced increases in the concentrations of interleukins 4 and 13; (ii) the cytokine-induced upregulation of the expression of syncytin 1 and annexin A5; and (iii) cancer cell fusion. In human prostate cancer tissues, expression of syncytin 1 and annexin A5, proteins that we found to be required for the cell fusion, positively correlated with the cancer development suggesting that these proteins can be used as biomarkers to evaluate cancer progression and potential therapeutic targets. IMPLICATIONS: The discovered effects of muscle cells on prostate cancer cells reveal a novel and specific pathway by which muscle cells in the microenvironment of prostate cancer cells promote cell fusion and cancer progression.""","""['Berna Uygur', 'Evgenia Leikina', 'Kamran Melikov', 'Rafael Villasmil', 'Santosh K Verma', 'Calvin P H Vary', 'Leonid V Chernomordik']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Acquisition of tumorigenic potential and therapeutic resistance in CD133+ subpopulation of prostate cancer cells exhibiting stem-cell like characteristics.', 'Reciprocal Network between Cancer Stem-Like Cells and Macrophages Facilitates the Progression and Androgen Deprivation Therapy Resistance of Prostate Cancer.', 'Annexin A1 is involved in the acquisition and maintenance of a stem cell-like/aggressive phenotype in prostate cancer cells with acquired resistance to zoledronic acid.', 'MicroRNAs targeting prostate cancer stem cells.', 'CD147/EMMPRIN and CD44 are potential therapeutic targets for metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Intrinsic signalling factors associated with cancer cell-cell fusion.', 'Syncytin-mediated open-ended membrane tubular connections facilitate the intercellular transfer of cargos including Cas9 protein.', 'Extracellular Events Involved in Cancer Cell-Cell Fusion.', 'A comprehensive investigation of human endogenous retroviral syncytin proteins and their receptors in men with normozoospermia and impaired semen quality.', 'Involvement of the HERV-derived cell-fusion inhibitor, suppressyn, in the fusion defects characteristic of the trisomy 21 placenta.']"""

Microenvironment secretome provides information related to its biology. This study was performed to identify secreted proteins by PPAT, from both prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients.  Patients and methods:   Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis was performed in PPAT-conditioned media (CM) from patients with prostate cancer (CMs-T) (stage T3: CM-T3, stage T2: CM-T2) or benign disease (CM-BPH).  Results:   The highest number and diversity of proteins was identified in CM-T3. Locomotion was the biological process mainly associated to CMs-T and reproduction to CM-T3. Immune responses were enriched in CMs-T. Extracellular matrix and structural proteins were associated to CMs-T. CM-T3 was enriched in proteins with catalytic activity and CM-T2 in proteins with defense/immunity activity. Metabolism and energy pathways were enriched in CM-T3 and those with immune system functions in CMs-T. Transport proteins were enriched in CM-T2 and CM-BPH.

Melanoma and lung cancer demonstrate high response rates to ICIs and are commonly referred to as ""hot tumors"". These are in sharp contrast to tumors with low immune infiltrates called ""cold tumors"" or non-T-cell-inflamed cancers, such as those from the prostate and pancreas. Classification of tumors based on their immune phenotype can partially explain clinical response to ICIs. However, this model alone cannot fully explain the lack of response among many patients treated with ICIs.Dichotomizing tumors based on their mutation profile into high tumor mutation burden (TMB) or low TMB, such as many childhood malignancies, can also, to some extent, explain the clinical response to immunotherapy. This model mainly focuses on a tumor's genotype rather than its immune phenotype. High TMB tumors often have higher levels of neoantigens that can be recognized by the immune system. In the current era of immunotherapy, with the lack of definitive biomarkers, we need to evaluate tumors based on both their immune phenotype and genomic mutation profile to determine which patients have a higher likelihood of responding to treatment with ICIs.""","""['Saman Maleki Vareki']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['T-Cell-Inflamed Gene-Expression Profile, Programmed Death Ligand 1 Expression, and Tumor Mutational Burden Predict Efficacy in Patients Treated With Pembrolizumab Across 20 Cancers: KEYNOTE-028.', 'Use of targeted next generation sequencing to characterize tumor mutational burden and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in small cell lung cancer.', 'MHC-I genotype and tumor mutational burden predict response to immunotherapy.', 'Targeting inflamed and non-inflamed melanomas: biological background and clinical challenges.', 'Beyond Tumor PD-L1: Emerging Genomic Biomarkers for Checkpoint Inhibitor Immunotherapy.', 'Tumor-derived interleukin-1 receptor antagonist exhibits immunosuppressive functions and promotes pancreatic cancer.', 'Integrative analysis of multi-omics data for discovery of ferroptosis-related gene signature predicting immune activity in neuroblastoma.', 'Inflammation induced by tumor-associated nerves promotes resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in cancer patients and is targetable by IL-6 blockade.', 'Cyto-IL-15 synergizes with the STING agonist ADU-S100 to eliminate prostate tumors and confer durable immunity in mouse models.', 'Circadian pattern subtyping unveiling distinct immune landscapes in breast cancer patients for better immunotherapy.']"""

The present case-control study was performed on 178 patients with PCa and 180 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Genotyping of the variants was done by mismatch PCR-RFLP. The findings showed that the rs3787016 C > T variant significantly increased the risk of PCa in codominant (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.12-3.03, P = 0.018, CT vs CC), dominant (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.63-3.05, P = 0.011, CT + TT vas CC) and allele (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.52-2.72, P = 0.010, T vs C) inheritance model. Regarding rs1046040 C > T polymorphism, the findings revealed that the CT genotype significantly increased the risk of PCa compared to the CC genotype (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.03-2.49, P = 0.043). Furthermore, rs3787016 CT/rs1046040 CC as well as rs3787016 CT/rs1046040 CT increased the risk of PCa compared to the CC/CC genotype (p = 0.029 and p = 0.014, respectively). Haplotype analysis proposed that rs3787016 T/rs1046040 C significantly increased the risk of PCa compared to C/C (p = 0.037).
