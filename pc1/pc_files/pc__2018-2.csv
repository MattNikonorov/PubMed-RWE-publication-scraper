Here we found a higher expression of TR4 in ccRCC tumors from patients with distant metastases than those from metastasis-free patients, suggesting TR4 may play positive roles in the ccRCC metastasis. Results from multiple in vitro ccRCC cell lines also confirmed TR4's positive roles in promoting ccRCC cell invasion/migration via altering the microRNA (miR-32-5p)/TR4/HGF/Met/MMP2-MMP9 signaling. Mechanism dissection revealed that miR-32-5p could suppress TR4 protein expression levels via direct binding to the 3'UTR of TR4 mRNA, and TR4 might then alter the HGF/Met signaling at the transcriptional level via direct binding to the TR4-response-elements (TR4RE) on the HGF promoter. Then the in vitro data also demonstrated the efficacy of Sunitinib, a currently used drug to treat ccRCC, could be increased after targeting this newly identified miR-32-5p/TR4/HGF/Met signaling. The preclinical study using the in vivo mouse model with xenografted ccRCC cells confirmed the in vitro cell lines data. Together, these findings suggest that TR4 is a key player to promote ccRCC metastasis and targeting this miR-32-5p/TR4/HGF/Met signaling with small molecules including TR4-shRNA or miR-32-5p may help to develop a new therapy to better suppress the ccRCC metastasis.""","""['Mingchao Wang', 'Yin Sun', 'Junjie Xu', 'Jieyang Lu', 'Kefeng Wang', 'Dong-Rong Yang', 'Guosheng Yang', 'Gonghui Li', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['TR4 nuclear receptor promotes clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation and metastasis via altering the miR490-3p/vimentin signals.', 'Targeting the TR4 nuclear receptor-mediated lncTASR/AXL signaling with tretinoin increases the sunitinib sensitivity to better suppress the RCC progression.', 'Sunitinib-suppressed miR-452-5p facilitates renal cancer cell invasion and metastasis through modulating SMAD4/SMAD7 signals.', 'Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma: MicroRNAs With Efficacy in Preclinical In Vivo Models.', 'Modeling clear cell renal cell carcinoma and therapeutic implications.', 'Integrated network findings reveal ubiquitin-specific protease 44 overexpression suppresses tumorigenicity of liver cancer.', 'Structures of human TR4LBD-JAZF1 and TR4DBD-DNA complexes reveal the molecular basis of transcriptional regulation.', ""Integrated Transcriptome Analysis Reveals mRNA-miRNA Pathway Crosstalk in Roman Laying Hens' Immune Organs Induced by AFB1."", 'Isolated Pancreatic Metastases of Renal Cell Cancer: Genetics and Epigenetics of an Unusual Tumour Entity.', 'miR-616-5p Promotes Invasion and Migration of Bladder Cancer via Downregulating NR2C2 Expression.']"""

The hypothesis in this study is that computer-based cryosurgery training for an optimal cryoprobe layout is essentially a matter of exposure time, rather than trainee background or the specific computer-generated planning target. Key geometric features under considerations are associated with spatial limitations on cryoprobes placement and the match between the resulted thermal field and the unique anatomy of the prostate.  Methods:   All experiments in this study were performed on the cryosurgery trainer-a prototype platform for computerized cryosurgery training, which has been presented previously. Among its key features, the cryosurgery trainer displays the prostate shape and its contours and provides a distance measurement tool on demand, in order to address spatial constraints during ultrasound imaging guidance. Another unique feature of the cryosurgery trainer is an output movie, displaying the simulated thermal field at the end of the cryoprocedure.  Results:   The current study was performed on graduate engineering students having no formal background in medicine, and the results were benchmarked against data obtained on surgical residents having no experience with cryosurgery. Despite fundamental differences in background and experience, neither group displayed superior performance when it comes to cryoprobe layout planning.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that computer-based training of an optimal cryoprobe layout is feasible. This study demonstrates that the training quality is essentially related to the training exposure time, rather than to a specific planning strategy from those investigated.""","""['Purva Joshi', 'Anjali Sehrawat', 'Yoed Rabin']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Simulation-Based Cryosurgery Training: Variable Insertion Depth Planning in Prostate Cryosurgery.', 'Simulation-Based Cryosurgery Intelligent Tutoring System Prototype.', 'A Computerized Tutor Prototype for Prostate Cryotherapy: Key Building Blocks and System Evaluation.', 'Image-guided prostate cryosurgery: state of the art.', 'Future directions for cryosurgery computer treatment planning.']"""

This study aimed to determine if selective uptake of 99mTc-maraciclatide, a radiopharmaceutical targeting αvβ3 integrin, occurs in prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastases and to observe the changes following systemic therapy.  Methods:   The study group comprised 17 men with bone-predominant metastatic PCa who underwent whole-body planar and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging with 99mTc-maraciclatide before (n = 17) and 12 weeks after (n = 11) starting treatment with abiraterone. Tumour to normal bone (T:N) ratios, tumour to muscle (T:M) ratios and CT Hounsfield units (HU) were measured in up to five target metastases in each subject. An oncologist blinded to study scans assessed clinical responses up to 24 weeks using conventional criteria.  Results:   Before treatment, metastases showed specific 99mTc-maraciclatide accumulation (mean planar T:N and T:M ratios 1.43 and 3.06; SPECT T:N and T:M ratios 3.1 and 5.19, respectively). Baseline sclerotic lesions (389-740 HU) showed lower T:M ratios (4.22 vs. 7.04, p = 0.02) than less sclerotic/lytic lesions (46-381 HU). Patients with progressive disease (PD; n = 5) showed increased planar T:N and T:M ratios (0.29 and 12.1%, respectively) and SPECT T:N and T:M ratios (11.9 and 20.2%, respectively). Patients without progression showed decreased planar T:N and T:M ratios (0.27 and -8.0%, p = 1.0 and 0.044, respectively) and SPECT T:N and T:M ratios (-21.9, and -27.2%, p = 0.3 and 0.036, respectively). The percentage change in CT HU was inversely correlated with the percentage change in SPECT T:M ratios (r = -0.59, p = 0.006).  Conclusions: 99mTc-maraciclatide accumulates in PCa bone metastases in keeping with increased αvβ3 integrin expression. Greater activity in metastases with lower CT density suggests that uptake is related to osteoclast activity. Changes in planar and SPECT T:M ratios after 12 weeks of treatment differed between patients with and without PD and 99mTc-maraciclatide imaging may be a potential method for assessing early response.""","""['Gary J R Cook', 'Gurdip K Azad', 'Benjamin P Taylor', 'Eugene Lee', 'Matthew S Morrison', 'Simon Hughes', 'Stephen Morris', 'Sarah Rudman', 'Simon Chowdhury', 'Vicky Goh']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['99mTc3PRGD2 for integrin receptor imaging of esophageal cancer: a comparative study with 18FFDG PET/CT.', 'The role of Tc-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy in the diagnosis and follow-up of lung cancer lesions.', 'Comparison of 99mTc3PRGD2 Imaging and 18FFDG PET/CT in Breast Cancer and Expression of Integrin αvβ3 in Breast Cancer Vascular Endothelial Cells.', '18F-NaF-PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy in the Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer.', '99mTc-Labeled trans-1,2-cyclohexyldinitrilo tetramethylene phosphonic acid.', 'Radiopharmaceuticals for PET and SPECT Imaging: A Literature Review over the Last Decade.', 'Role of αVβ3 in Prostate Cancer: Metastasis Initiator and Important Therapeutic Target.']"""

Here we report that expression of S18-2 was increased with disease progression in clinical specimens of prostate cancer (PCa). The level of induction of epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition (EMT) correlated with the expression level of S18-2 in PCa cell lines. Moreover, cells acquired increased ability of migration upon S18-2 overexpression, as was evaluated in zebrafish embryo model and in trans-well assay. We found that this is due to increased CXCR4 cell surface expression. Neutralizing CXCR4 protein or abrogating S18-2 expression in cells significantly reduced their migratory ability directed toward CXCL12. The mRNA expression of TWIST2, encoding one of transcription factors that induce EMT upon CXCR4 increase, positively correlated with the S18-2 protein level. Together, these data suggest that the S18-2 protein induces EMT through the TWIST2/E-cadherin signalling and, consequently, CXCR4-mediated migration of PCa cells.""","""['Muhammad Mushtaq', 'Lasse Jensen', 'Sabina Davidsson', 'Oleksandr V Grygoruk', 'Ove Andrén', 'Vladimir Kashuba', 'Elena Kashuba']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['The effect of CXCR4 silencing on epithelial-mesenchymal transition related genes in glioma U87 cells.', 'Inhibition of CXCR4 regulates epithelial mesenchymal transition of NSCLC via the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.', 'HIF-2α promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition through regulating Twist2 binding to the promoter of E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer.', 'Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S18-2 is highly expressed in endometrial cancers along with free E2F1.', 'Role of TWIST2, E-cadherin and Vimentin in epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis and prognosis and their interaction in cancer progression.', 'Involvement of CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in colorectal cancer: a mini-review.', 'CXCL12 Signaling in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Ribosome Biogenesis and Cancer: Overview on Ribosomal Proteins.', 'CXCR4 and CXCR7 Signaling Pathways: A Focus on the Cross-Talk Between Cancer Cells and Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Human Mitoribosome Biogenesis and Its Emerging Links to Disease.']"""

CR occurs in murine tumors and ROS-damaged phenylalanine, meta-tyrosine (m-Tyr), was proposed as the serum anti-tumor factor primarily responsible for CR. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that CR happens in different experimental human solid tumors (prostate, lung anaplastic, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma). Moreover, m-Tyr was detected in the serum of mice bearing prostate cancer (PCa) xenografts. Primary tumor growth was inhibited in animals injected with m-Tyr. Further, the CR phenomenon was reversed when secondary implants were injected into mice with phenylalanine (Phe), a protective amino acid highly present in primary tumors. PCa cells exposed to m-Tyr in vitro showed reduced cell viability, downregulated NFκB/STAT3/Notch axis, and induced autophagy; effects reversed by Phe. Strikingly, m-Tyr administration also impaired both, spontaneous metastasis derived from murine mammary carcinomas (4T1, C7HI, and LMM3) and PCa experimental metastases. Altogether, our findings propose m-Tyr delivery as a novel approach to boost the therapeutic efficacy of the current treatment for metastasis preventing the escape from tumor dormancy.""","""['Geraldine Gueron', 'Nicolás Anselmino', 'Paula Chiarella', 'Emiliano G Ortiz', 'Sofia Lage Vickers', 'Alejandra V Paez', 'Jimena Giudice', 'Mario D Contin', 'Daiana Leonardi', 'Felipe Jaworski', 'Verónica Manzano', 'Ariel Strazza', 'Daniela R Montagna', 'Estefania Labanca', 'Javier Cotignola', 'Norma D Accorso', 'Anna Woloszynska-Read', 'Nora Navone', 'Roberto P Meiss', 'Raúl Ruggiero', 'Elba Vazquez']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['The STAT3 Inhibitor Galiellalactone Effectively Reduces Tumor Growth and Metastatic Spread in an Orthotopic Xenograft Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'RNA interference targeting PSCA suppresses primary tumor growth and metastasis formation of human prostate cancer xenografts in SCID mice.', 'Tyrosine isomers mediate the classical phenomenon of concomitant tumor resistance.', 'Concomitant tumor resistance: the role of tyrosine isomers in the mechanisms of metastases control.', 'Specificity of the suppression of metastatic phenotype by tyrosine and phenylalanine restriction.', 'Crosstalk between Metabolite Production and Signaling Activity in Breast Cancer.', 'Inhibition of hyperprogressive cancer disease induced by immune-checkpoint blockade upon co-treatment with meta-tyrosine and p38 pathway inhibitor.', 'Translational incorporation of modified phenylalanines and tyrosines during cell-free protein synthesis.', 'Assessing Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid Therapeutic Effect for Glioblastoma Multiforme.', 'Toxicity of meta-Tyrosine.']"""

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is higher in PCa cells compared to normal prostate epithelial cells and this increase is proportional to the aggressiveness of the phenotype. Since high density lipoproteins (HDL) are known to exert antioxidant activities, their ability to reduce ROS levels and the consequent impact on cell proliferation was tested in normal and PCa cell lines. HDL significantly reduced basal and H2O2-induced oxidative stress in normal, androgen receptor (AR)-positive and AR-null PCa cell lines. AR, scavenger receptor BI and ATP binding cassette G1 transporter were not involved. In addition, HDL completely blunted H2O2-induced increase of cell proliferation, through their capacity to prevent the H2O2-induced shift of cell cycle distribution from G0/G1 towards G2/M phase. Synthetic HDL, made of the two main components of plasma-derived HDL (apoA-I and phosphatidylcholine) and which are under clinical development as anti-atherosclerotic agents, retained the ability of HDL to inhibit ROS production in PCa cells. Collectively, HDL antioxidant activity limits cell proliferation induced by ROS in AR-positive and AR-null PCa cell lines, thus supporting a possible role of HDL against PCa progression.""","""['Massimiliano Ruscica', 'Margherita Botta', 'Nicola Ferri', 'Eleonora Giorgio', 'Chiara Macchi', 'Guido Franceschini', 'Paolo Magni', 'Laura Calabresi', 'Monica Gomaraschi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['HDL-mediated reduction of cholesterol content inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells induced by LDL: Role of ABCA1 and proteasome inhibition.', 'Lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I and discoidal reconstituted high-density lipoproteins differentially inhibit glucose-induced oxidative stress in human macrophages.', 'High-density lipoproteins prevent the oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced epidermal corrected growth factor receptor activation and subsequent matrix metalloproteinase-2 upregulation.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Myeloperoxidase: an inflammatory enzyme for generating dysfunctional high density lipoprotein.', 'Constant Association between Low High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Gastric Cancer Regardless of Site.', 'HDL Functions-Current Status and Future Perspectives.', 'A Phase I-II multicenter trial with Avelumab plus autologous dendritic cell vaccine in pre-treated mismatch repair-proficient (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer patients; GEMCAD 1602 study.', 'HDL-mediated reduction of cholesterol content inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells induced by LDL: Role of ABCA1 and proteasome inhibition.', 'The Role of High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in 2022.']"""

Prostate-specific antigen has been considered the most important biomarker for PCa detection; however, it lacks specificity, leading to the search for alternative biomarkers. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released during cell metabolism and can be found in exhaled breath, urine, and other fluids. VOCs have been used in the diagnosis of lung, breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers, among others. The objective of this study was to identify urinary VOCs that may be sensitive and specific biomarkers for PCa.  Methods:   The study included 29 patients with PCa and 21 with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Urine samples were obtained from all participants before and after prostate massage. VOCs were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. IBM SPSS Statistics v.20 was used for statistical analysis. Sample normality and homogeneity of variances were studied and, according to the distribution normality, ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to evaluate significant differences between groups. The Pearson test was used to establish correlations.  Results:   Fifty-seven VOCs were identified. Samples gathered before prostate massage showed significant between-group differences in urinary levels of furan (P≤ 0.001), 2-ethylhexanol (P = 0.032), 3,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde (P = 0.027), santolin triene (P = 0.032), and 2,6-dimethyl-7-octen-2-ol (P = 0.003). Samples gathered after prostate massage showed significant differences in urinary levels of furan (P≤ 0.001), 3- methylphenol (P = 0.014), p-xylene (P = 0.002), phenol (P≤ 0.001), and 2-butanone (P = 0.001).

Objective:   o evaluate whether six cycles of docetaxel alone improve biochemical disease-free survival after radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Open-label, randomised multinational phase 3 trial. Enrolment of 459 patients after prostatectomy.  Inclusion criteria:   high-risk pT2 margin positive or pT3a Gleason score ≥4+3, pT3b, or lymph node positive disease Gleason score ≥3+4. Patients assigned (1:1) to either six cycles of adjuvant docetaxel 75mg/m2 every 3 wk without daily prednisone (Arm A) or surveillance (Arm B) until endpoint was reached. Primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen progression ≥0.5 ng/ml.  Intervention:   Docetaxel treatment after prostatectomy.  Results and limitations:   Median time to progression, death, or last follow-up was 56.8 mo. Primary endpoint was reached in 190/459 patients-the risk of progression at 5 yr being 41% (45% in Arm A and 38% in Arm B). There was evidence of nonproportional hazards in Kaplan-Meier analysis, so we used the difference in restricted mean survival time as the primary estimate of effect. Restricted mean survival time to endpoint was 43 mo in Arm A versus 46 mo in Arm B (p=0.06), a nonsignificant difference of 3.2 mo (95% confidence interval: 6.7 to -1.5 mo).

Independent verification calculations using Monte Carlo methods for Vero4DRT have been published. As the Clarkson method is faster and easier to use than measurement and Monte Carlo methods, we evaluated the accuracy of an independent calculation verification program and its feasibility as a secondary check for Vero4DRT. Computed tomography (CT)-based dose calculation was performed using a modified Clarkson-based algorithm. In this study, 120 patients' treatment plans were collected in our institute. The treatments were performed using conventional irradiation for lung and prostate, 3-dimensional (3D) conformal stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the lung, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the prostate. Differences between the treatment planning system (TPS) and the Clarkson-based independent dose verification software were computed, and confidence limits (CLs, mean ± 2 standard deviation %) for Vero4DRT were compared with the CLs for the C-arms linear accelerators in the previous study. The results of the CLs, the conventional irradiation, SBRT, and IMRT showed 2.2 ± 3.5% (CL of the C-arms linear accelerators: 2.4 ± 5.3%), 1.1 ± 1.7% (-0.3 ± 2.0%), 4.8 ± 3.7% (5.4 ± 5.3%), and -0.5 ± 2.5% (-0.1 ± 3.6%) differences, respectively. The dose disagreement between the TPS and CT-based independent dose verification software was less than the 5% action level of American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 114 (TG114).

Materials and methods:   Between 2012 and 2015, we identified 9703 patients treated with retropubic radical prostatectomy (RP) in four tertiary centers. Biopsy specimens as well as radical prostatectomy specimens were graded according to both 2005 Gleason and 2014 ISUP five-tier Gleason grading system (five-tier GG system). Upgrading and downgrading rates on radical prostatectomy were first recorded for both classifications and then compared. The accuracy of the biopsy for each histological classification was determined by using the kappa coefficient of agreement and by assessing sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value.  Results:   The five-tier GG system presented a lower clinically significant upgrading rate (1895/9703: 19,5% vs 2332/9703:24.0%; p = .001) and a similar clinically significant downgrading rate (756/9703: 7,7% vs 779/9703: 8%; p = .267) when compared to the 2005 ISUP classification. When evaluating their accuracy, the new five-tier GG system presented a better specificity (91% vs 83%) and a better negative predictive value (78% vs 60%). The kappa-statistics measures of agreement between needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens were poor and good respectively for the five-tier GG system and for the 2005 Gleason score (k = 0.360 ± 0.007 vs k = 0.426 ± 0.007).  Conclusions:   The new Epstein classification significantly reduces upgrading events.

However, the contribution of Myo1b to cervical cancer (CC) remains elusive.  Methods:   Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry and western blotting assays were used to confirm the expression of Myo1b in CC tissues compared with matched non-tumor tissues and CC cells, and analyze its clinical significance. In vitro, RNA interference (siRNA or shRNA) was used to investigate the biological function and underlying mechanism of Myo1b in cervical carcinogenesis. Furthermore, tumor growth was evaluated in vivo using a xenogenous subcutaneously implant model.  Results:   Here, for the first time we reported that Myo1b expression was significantly increased in human CC, compared to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and normal cervical tissues and that the upregulation of Myo1b was significantly correlated with FIGO Stage, HPV infection, lymph node metastasis and pathological grade. In vitro, knockdown of Myo1b significantly suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of CaSki and SiHa cells, and markedly decreased the MMP1/MMP9 activities. Also, silencing the expression of Myo1b dramatically repressed tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Further investigations showed that HPV16 E6 or E7 could enhance the expression of Myo1b via upregulating c-MYC.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our data suggested a potential role of Myo1b in cervical carcinogenesis and tumor progression and provided novel insights into the mechanism of how this factor promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in CC cells.""","""['Han-Rong Zhang', 'Shu-Yu Lai', 'Li-Jun Huang', 'Zhen-Fei Zhang', 'Jie Liu', 'Si-Rong Zheng', 'Ke Ding', 'Xin Bai', 'Jue-Yu Zhou']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Gynecol Oncol""","""['HOXC13 promotes cervical cancer proliferation, invasion and Warburg effect through β-catenin/c-Myc signaling pathway.', 'Myosin 1b promotes migration, invasion and glycolysis in cervical cancer via ERK/HIF-1α pathway.', 'FABP5 promotes cell growth, invasion and metastasis in cervical cancer.', 'Aberrant Myosin 1b Expression Promotes Cell Migration and Lymph Node Metastasis of HNSCC.', 'HPV E6/E7 promotes aerobic glycolysis in cervical cancer by regulating IGF2BP2 to stabilize m6A-MYC expression.', 'CCND1-associated ceRNA network reveal the critical pathway of TPRG1-AS1-hsa-miR-363-3p-MYO1B as a prognostic marker for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Myo1b Promotes Premature Endothelial Senescence and Dysfunction via Suppressing Autophagy: Implications for Vascular Aging.', 'Myo1b promotes tumor progression and angiogenesis by inhibiting autophagic degradation of HIF-1α in colorectal cancer.', 'Comprehensive Landscape of Prognostic Significance and Immune Characteristics of Myosins in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck.', 'Chromatin accessibility and transcriptome integrative analysis revealed AP-1-mediated genes potentially modulate histopathology features in psoriasis.']"""

Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a database of electronic health records from oncology practices across the United States. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of prostate cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] code 185/International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] code C61) before or concurrent with a visit between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015; follow-up was performed through June 30, 2016. From this population, we identified those who received an emerging therapy and a subset who also received denosumab or zoledronic acid.  Findings:   A total of 71,606 men met the eligibility criteria, and 5131 (7%) received emerging therapy. In the emerging therapy cohort (at the time of the first use), median age was 75 years, median prostate-specific antigen value was 22.7 ng/mL, 56% had bone metastases, and 80% were docetaxel naive. Abiraterone and enzalutamide were the most commonly used first emerging therapies (52% and 31%, respectively), followed by sipuleucel-T (9%), cabazitaxel (5%), and radium-223 (1.5%). Of the emerging therapy cohort, 3121 patients (61%) received concomitant denosumab (70%) or zoledronic acid (35%); 5% received both.  Implications:   Among patients with prostate cancer treated in the United States, most of those treated with an emerging therapy between 2013 and 2015 also received denosumab or zoledronic acid, suggesting that the concomitant use of these therapy types is currently a common practice.

CONCORD-3 updates the worldwide surveillance of cancer survival to 2014.  Methods:   CONCORD-3 includes individual records for 37·5 million patients diagnosed with cancer during the 15-year period 2000-14. Data were provided by 322 population-based cancer registries in 71 countries and territories, 47 of which provided data with 100% population coverage. The study includes 18 cancers or groups of cancers: oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, lung, breast (women), cervix, ovary, prostate, and melanoma of the skin in adults, and brain tumours, leukaemias, and lymphomas in both adults and children. Standardised quality control procedures were applied; errors were rectified by the registry concerned. We estimated 5-year net survival. Estimates were age-standardised with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights.  Findings:   For most cancers, 5-year net survival remains among the highest in the world in the USA and Canada, in Australia and New Zealand, and in Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. For many cancers, Denmark is closing the survival gap with the other Nordic countries. Survival trends are generally increasing, even for some of the more lethal cancers: in some countries, survival has increased by up to 5% for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and lung. For women diagnosed during 2010-14, 5-year survival for breast cancer is now 89·5% in Australia and 90·2% in the USA, but international differences remain very wide, with levels as low as 66·1% in India. For gastrointestinal cancers, the highest levels of 5-year survival are seen in southeast Asia: in South Korea for cancers of the stomach (68·9%), colon (71·8%), and rectum (71·1%); in Japan for oesophageal cancer (36·0%); and in Taiwan for liver cancer (27·9%). By contrast, in the same world region, survival is generally lower than elsewhere for melanoma of the skin (59·9% in South Korea, 52·1% in Taiwan, and 49·6% in China), and for both lymphoid malignancies (52·5%, 50·5%, and 38·3%) and myeloid malignancies (45·9%, 33·4%, and 24·8%). For children diagnosed during 2010-14, 5-year survival for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ranged from 49·8% in Ecuador to 95·2% in Finland. 5-year survival from brain tumours in children is higher than for adults but the global range is very wide (from 28·9% in Brazil to nearly 80% in Sweden and Denmark).  Interpretation:   The CONCORD programme enables timely comparisons of the overall effectiveness of health systems in providing care for 18 cancers that collectively represent 75% of all cancers diagnosed worldwide every year. It contributes to the evidence base for global policy on cancer control. Since 2017, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has used findings from the CONCORD programme as the official benchmark of cancer survival, among their indicators of the quality of health care in 48 countries worldwide. Governments must recognise population-based cancer registries as key policy tools that can be used to evaluate both the impact of cancer prevention strategies and the effectiveness of health systems for all patients diagnosed with cancer.

To evaluate the goodness-of-fit and the correlation of those models with those symptoms.  Methods:   Ninety-three consecutive patients treated from 2010 to 2015 with post-prostatectomy image-guided intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) were included in this study. Patient-reported urinary symptoms were collected pre-RT and weekly during treatment using the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices (PCSI). The assessed symptoms were flow, dysuria, urgency, incontinence, frequency and nocturia using a Likert scale of 1 to 4 or 5. For this analysis, an increase by ≥2 levels in a symptom at any time during treatment compared to baseline was considered clinically significant. The dose volume histograms of the bladder were calculated. The Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB), Relative Seriality (RS) and Logit NTCP models were used to fit the clinical data. The fitting of the different models was assessed through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Odds Ratio methods.  Results:   For the symptoms of urinary urgency, leakage, frequency and nocturia, the derived LKB model parameters were: 1) D50 = 64.2Gy, m = 0.50, n = 1.0; 2) D50 = 95.0Gy, m = 0.45, n = 0.50; 3) D50 = 83.1Gy, m = 0.56, n = 1.00; and 4) D50 = 85.4Gy, m = 0.60, n = 1.00, respectively. The AUC values for those symptoms were 0.66, 0.58, 0.64 and 0.64, respectively. The differences in AIC between the different models were less than 2 and ranged within 0.1 and 1.3.  Conclusions:   Different dose metrics were correlated with the symptoms of urgency, incontinence, frequency and nocturia. The symptoms of urinary flow and dysuria were poorly associated with dose. The values of the parameters of three NTCP models were determined for bladder regarding four acute urinary symptoms. All the models could fit the clinical data equally well.

Results:   The rate of PSM at an FMB level of at 2 was 18.8%, which was significantly greater than the rates at levels 0 (5.4%) and 1 (7.8%). The level of FMB (p = 0.007) and percentage of tumor volume (p = 0.012) were identified as independent factors predictive of a positive surgical margin in a multivariate analysis. The 5-year BCR-free survival rates for a level 0-1 FMB with negative surgical margin, level 0-1 FMB with positive surgical margin, level 2 FMB with negative surgical margin, and level 2 FMB with positive surgical margin were 96.6%, 86.4%, 85.6%, and 72.9%, respectively (p < 0.001).

A national registry survey was performed to assess the size of this association, and the temporal relationship of cancer diagnosis to GN diagnosis.  Methods:   All patients with biopsy-proven GN between 1985 and 2015 in Denmark were extracted from The Danish Renal Biopsy Registry and the National Pathology Data Bank. Incident cancer diagnoses between 10 years previous and 10 years subsequent to the GN diagnosis were extracted from the Danish Cancer Registry. Residence, birth and death data were obtained from the National Patient Register. Expected cancer incidence, classified according to cohort, age and sex were extracted from the Nordcan database.  Results:   Nine hundred eleven cancers were diagnosed in 5594 patients. Thirty five percent were prevalent at renal biopsy. Prevalence at biopsy was 5.5% (expected 3.1%), but incidence was not increased < 1 year before biopsy. Increased cancer rates were seen for GN forms: minimal change, endocapillary, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, mesangioproliferative, membranous, focal segmental, membranoproliferative, proliferative, ANCA-associated vasculitis, lupus nephritis and unclassified. Increased cancer rates were seen for lung, prostate, renal, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, leukaemia and skin. The increased incidence was mainly limited to - 1 to 1 year after biopsy, but skin cancer showed an increased risk over time. Some diagnoses showed an increase 5-10 years after biopsy. Incidence was raised for patients with uraemia and nephrosis, but less for proteinuria or haematuria. Cancers in patients < 45 years were rare. The risk of developing cancer 0-3 years after biopsy for patients 45-64 years varied from 7.3% (minimal change) to 15.8% (unclassified GN); > 64 years from 11.8 (endocapillary GN) to 20.3% (unclassified). The diagnosis with the highest risk was membranoproliferative GN (8.6 & 19.6%).  Conclusions:   Cancer rates are increased for many cancer and most GN diagnoses. Cancer screening for patients < 45 years and for patients without nephrosis or uraemia may not be necessary. The findings suggest that screening programs for specific GN diagnoses can be extended to other GN forms.""","""['James Goya Heaf', 'Alastair Hansen', 'Gunnar Hellmund Laier']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Nephrol""","""['The epidemiology and prognosis of glomerulonephritis in Denmark 1985-1997.', 'Epidemiology of renal disease in Romania: a 10 year review of two regional renal biopsy databases.', 'Increased incidence and improved prognosis of glomerulonephritis: a national 30-year study.', 'Instructions and implementations for percutaneous renal biopsy.

Although nc886/vtRNA2-1/Pre-miR-886 identity is still controversial, it was shown to be epigenetically controlled, presenting both tumor suppressor and oncogenic function in different cancers. Here, we study for the first time the role of nc886 in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Nc886 promoter methylation status and its correlation with patient clinical parameters or DNMTs levels were evaluated in TCGA and specific GEO prostate tissue datasets. Nc886 level was measured by RT-qPCR to compare normal/neoplastic prostate cells from radical prostatectomies and cell lines, and to assess nc886 response to demethylating agents. The effect of nc886 recovery in cell proliferation (in vitro and in vivo) and invasion (in vitro) was evaluated using lentiviral transduced DU145 and LNCaP cell lines. The association between the expression of nc886 and selected genes was analyzed in the TCGA-PRAD cohort.  Results:   Nc886 promoter methylation increases in tumor vs. normal prostate tissue, as well as in metastatic vs. normal prostate tissue. Additionally, nc886 promoter methylation correlates with prostate cancer clinical staging, including biochemical recurrence, Clinical T-value and Gleason score. Nc886 transcript is downregulated in tumor vs. normal tissue -in agreement with its promoter methylation status- and increases upon demethylating treatment. In functional studies, the overexpression of nc886 in the LNCaP and DU145 cell line leads to a decreased in vitro cell proliferation and invasion, as well as a reduced in vivo cell growth in NUDE-mice tumor xenografts. Finally, nc886 expression associates with the prostate cancer cell cycle progression gene signature in TCGA-PRAD.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest a tumor suppressor role for nc886 in the prostate, whose expression is epigenetically silenced in cancer leading to an increase in cell proliferation and invasion. Nc886 might hold clinical value in prostate cancer due to its association with clinical parameters and with a clinically validated gene signature.""","""['Rafael Sebastián Fort', 'Cecilia Mathó', 'Murilo Vieira Geraldo', 'María Carolina Ottati', 'Alex Shimura Yamashita', 'Kelly Cristina Saito', 'Katia Ramos Moreira Leite', 'Manuel Méndez', 'Noemí Maedo', 'Laura Méndez', 'Beatriz Garat', 'Edna Teruko Kimura', 'José Roberto Sotelo-Silveira', 'María Ana Duhagon']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['vtRNA2-1/nc886 Produces a Small RNA That Contributes to Its Tumor Suppression Action through the microRNA Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulation of p53 expression and apoptosis by vault RNA2-1-5p in cervical cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-340 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting the MDM2-p53 pathway.', 'A Novel Type of Non-coding RNA, nc886, Implicated in Tumor Sensing and Suppression.', 'MicroRNAs as Guardians of the Prostate: Those Who Stand before Cancer.

Methods:   Using a high-bandwidth double-echo gradient echo sequence, field maps and distortion maps of the pelvis were calculated and evaluated for 219 exams (92 of female and 127 of male patients) to investigate patient-related image distortions caused by susceptibility differences in an ongoing study on MR-guided radiotherapy. The evaluation of distortions in the regions ""rectum"", ""prostate"", ""cervix"", and in a reference region in the gluteus maximus was based on masks drawn by two readers.

In the reference region, maximum distortions were smaller than in the prostate and cervix.  Conclusions:   Using a geometric uncertainty of 0.2 px (0.6 mm) in margin definition for organs that are close to the rectum like the prostate and the cervix would be a cautious choice to account for susceptibility-induced distortions that can arise during MR-based treatment guidance for the imaging setting used in this study.

Although the mechanisms contributing to vascular remodeling in PAH are still unclear, several features, including hyperproliferation and resistance to apoptosis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), have led to the emergence of the cancer-like concept. The molecular chaperone HSP90 (heat shock protein 90) is directly associated with malignant growth and proliferation under stress conditions. In addition to being highly expressed in the cytosol, HSP90 exists in a subcellular pool compartmentalized in the mitochondria (mtHSP90) of tumor cells, but not in normal cells, where it promotes cell survival.  Objectives:   We hypothesized that mtHSP90 in PAH-PASMCs represents a protective mechanism against stress, promoting their proliferation and resistance to apoptosis.  Methods:   Expression and localization of HSP90 were analyzed by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunogold electron microscopy. In vitro, effects of mtHSP90 inhibition on mitochondrial DNA integrity, bioenergetics, cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis were assessed. In vivo, the therapeutic potential of Gamitrinib, a mitochondria-targeted HSP90 inhibitor, was tested in fawn-hooded and monocrotaline rats.  Measurements and main results:   We demonstrated that, in response to stress, HSP90 preferentially accumulates in PAH-PASMC mitochondria (dual immunostaining, immunoblot, and immunogold electron microscopy) to ensure cell survival by preserving mitochondrial DNA integrity and bioenergetic functions. Whereas cytosolic HSP90 inhibition displays a lack of absolute specificity for PAH-PASMCs, Gamitrinib decreased mitochondrial DNA content and repair capacity and bioenergetic functions, thus repressing PAH-PASMC proliferation (Ki67 labeling) and resistance to apoptosis (Annexin V assay) without affecting control cells. In vivo, Gamitrinib improves PAH in two experimental rat models (monocrotaline and fawn-hooded rat).  Conclusions:   Our data show for the first time that accumulation of mtHSP90 is a feature of PAH-PASMCs and a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis contributing to vascular remodeling in PAH.""","""['Olivier Boucherat', 'Thibaut Peterlini', 'Alice Bourgeois', 'Valérie Nadeau', 'Sandra Breuils-Bonnet', 'Stéphanie Boilet-Molez', 'François Potus', 'Jolyane Meloche', 'Sophie Chabot', 'Caroline Lambert', 'Eve Tremblay', 'Young Chan Chae', 'Dario C Altieri', 'Gopinath Sutendra', 'Evangelos D Michelakis', 'Roxane Paulin', 'Steeve Provencher', 'Sébastien Bonnet']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Respir Crit Care Med""","""['Lessons from Cancer: Subcellular Drug Targeting of Mitochondrial HSP90 in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.', 'Inhibition of heat shock protein 90 improves pulmonary arteriole remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension.', 'Selenoprotein P Promotes the Development of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: Possible Novel Therapeutic Target.', 'PIM1 (Moloney Murine Leukemia Provirus Integration Site) Inhibition Decreases the Nonhomologous End-Joining DNA Damage Repair Signaling Pathway in Pulmonary Hypertension.', 'A proposed mitochondrial-metabolic mechanism for initiation and maintenance of pulmonary arterial hypertension in fawn-hooded rats: the Warburg model of pulmonary arterial hypertension.', 'Mitochondria in the Pulmonary Vasculature in Health and Disease: Oxygen-Sensing, Metabolism, and Dynamics.', 'Molecular Anatomy of the EML4-ALK Fusion Protein for the Development of Novel Anticancer Drugs.', 'Mitochondrial Homeostasis in VSMCs as a Central Hub in Vascular Remodeling.', 'The Role of HSP90 Inhibitors in the Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases.', 'Sox17 Deficiency Promotes Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension via HGF/c-Met Signaling.', 'DNA-PKcs participated in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension.']"""

Materials and Methods Twenty-two patients with prostate cancer underwent preoperative 3.0-T MR imaging. Axial images were obtained with hybrid multidimensional MR imaging by using all combinations of echo times (47, 75, 100 msec) and b values of 0, 750, 1500 sec/mm2, resulting in a 3 × 3 array of data associated with each voxel. Volumes of the tissue components stroma, epithelium, and lumen were calculated by fitting the hybrid data to a three-compartment signal model, with distinct, paired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2 values associated with each compartment. Volume fractions and conventional ADC and T2 were measured for regions of interest in sites of prostatectomy-verified malignancy (n = 28) and normal tissue (n = 71). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the performance of various parameters in differentiating prostate cancer from benign tissue. Results Compared with normal tissue, prostate cancer showed significantly increased fractional volumes of epithelium (23.2% ± 7.1 vs 48.8% ± 9.2, respectively) and reduced fractional volumes of lumen (26.4% ± 14.1 vs 14.0% ± 5.2) and stroma (50.5% ± 15.7 vs 37.2% ± 9.1) by using hybrid multidimensional MR imaging. The fractional volumes of tissue components show a significantly higher Spearman correlation coefficient with Gleason score (epithelium: ρ = 0.652, P = .0001; stroma: ρ = -0.439, P = .020; lumen: ρ = -0.390, P = .040) compared with traditional T2 values (ρ = -0.292, P = .132) and ADCs (ρ = -0.315, P = .102). The area under the ROC curve for differentiation of cancer from normal prostate was highest for fractional volume of epithelium (0.991), followed by fractional volumes of lumen (0.800) and stroma (0.789). Conclusion Fractional volumes of prostatic lumen, stroma, and epithelium change significantly when cancer is present. These parameters can be measured noninvasively by using hybrid multidimensional MR imaging and have the potential to improve the diagnosis of prostate cancer and determine its aggressiveness. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.""","""['Aritrick Chatterjee', 'Roger M Bourne', 'Shiyang Wang', 'Ajit Devaraj', 'Alexander J Gallan', 'Tatjana Antic', 'Gregory S Karczmar', 'Aytekin Oto']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiology""","""['Validation of Prostate Tissue Composition by Using Hybrid Multidimensional MRI: Correlation with Histologic Findings.', 'Contribution of Histopathologic Tissue Composition to Quantitative MR Spectroscopy and Diffusion-weighted Imaging of the Prostate.', 'Diffusion-weighted endorectal MR imaging at 3 T for prostate cancer: tumor detection and assessment of aggressiveness.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'New prostate MRI techniques and sequences.', 'Future of prostate imaging: Artificial intelligence in assessing prostatic magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Joint estimation of relaxation and diffusion tissue parameters for prostate cancer with relaxation-VERDICT MRI.', 'A Multicompartmental Diffusion Model for Improved Assessment of Whole-Body Diffusion-weighted Imaging Data and Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.', 'Detection of prostate cancer using diffusion-relaxation correlation spectrum imaging with support vector machine model - a feasibility study.', 'Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

To identify additional targets and molecular functions of miR-195, we overexpressed miR-195 by transient oligonucleotide transfection in DU145 and LNCaP cells and examined the effects. RNA-based microarray and dual-luciferase assays were carried out to identify novel targets of miR-195, while in vitro functional assays, a subcutaneous xenograft model, tissue microarray (TMA) analysis and a cohort of publicly available data (Taylor cohort) were used to investigate the biological function and clinical value of miR-195 targeting. The results shown that miR-195 overexpression could markedly suppress cellular proliferation and tube formation compared with miR-negative control. The RNA-based microarray identified a total of 153 differentially regulated genes with fold changes of ≤|1.5|, including 138 (90.2%) downregulated and 15 (9.8%) upregulated genes. Among the downregulated genes, we found that proline-rich protein 11 (PRR11) combined with miR-195 expression (miR-195/PRR11) could be used as an independent predictor of the risk of biochemical recurrence in the Taylor cohort. Additionally, the dual-luciferase assay identified PRR11 as a novel target of miR-195, and the in vitro assays indicated that PRR11 abrogated the suppressive effects of miR-195 on cell proliferation, tube formation and cell cycling. Furthermore, the subcutaneous tumor xenograft model indicated that knockdown of PRR11 inhibited xenograft growth and angiogenesis, while the results of the TMA and Taylor cohort analyses collectively demonstrated that PRR11 expression was upregulated in aggressive tumors and is associated with poor clinical outcome. Taken together, these findings further illustrate the suppressive role of miR-195 in PCa, and indicate a novel role of PRR11 in PCa. Importantly, the newly identified miR-195/PRR11 axis may aid with identifying potential therapeutic targets in PCa.""","""['Chao Cai', 'Huichan He', 'Xiaolu Duan', 'Wenqi Wu', 'Zanlin Mai', 'Tao Zhang', 'Junhong Fan', 'Tuo Deng', 'Wen Zhong', 'Yongda Liu', 'Weide Zhong', 'Guohua Zeng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Corrigendum miR‑195 inhibits cell proliferation and angiogenesis in human prostate cancer by downregulating PRR11 expression.', 'Knockdown of lncRNA DLX6-AS1 inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion while promotes apoptosis by downregulating PRR11 expression and upregulating miR-144 in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'miR-195 Inhibits Tumor Progression by Targeting RPS6KB1 in Human Prostate Cancer.', 'MiR-130b/TNF-α/NF-κB/VEGFA loop inhibits prostate cancer angiogenesis.', 'The miR-203/SNAI2 axis regulates prostate tumor growth, migration, angiogenesis and stemness potentially by modulating GSK-3β/β-CATENIN signal pathway.', 'Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer cells via miR-145-5p-mediated regulation of AKAP12.', 'Expression of SPAG7 and its regulatory microRNAs in seminal plasma and seminal plasma-derived extracellular vesicles of patients with subfertility.', 'PRR11 in Malignancies: Biological Activities and Targeted Therapies.', 'SPCMLMI: A structural perturbation-based matrix completion method to predict lncRNA-miRNA interactions.', 'Efficacy of green tea extract on PC3 prostate cancer cells through upregulation of miR-195 expression and suppression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'Pro-Angiogenesis Role of LINC00662 From Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells-Derived Extracellular Vehicles.']"""

The role of ETV2 in cancer has not yet been investigated. In the present study, the expression of ETV2 mRNA was identified in a variety of tumor types, including prostate carcinoma. In addition, ETV2 gene amplification was identified in several types of cancer, suggesting that ETV2 plays an oncogenic role in tumorigenesis. It was demonstrated that ETV2 forms complexes with two histone demethylases: Jumonji domain‑containing (JMJD)2A and JMJD2D; JMJD2A has been previously reported as a driver of prostate cancer development. In the present study, it was reported that ETV2 exhibited the potential to stimulate the promoters of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP1 and MMP7, within LNCaP prostate cancer cells. JMJD2A and JMJD2D could synergize with ETV2 to activate the MMP1 promoter, whereas only JMJD2A stimulated the MMP7 promoter in cooperation with ETV2. Furthermore, ETV2 expression was positively associated with JMJD2A and JMJD2D mRNA levels in neuroendocrine prostate tumors, in which an ETV2 gene amplification rate of 17.8% was identified. Collectively, the results of the present study indicated that ETV2, JMJD2A and JMJD2D may jointly promote tumorigenesis, particularly neuroendocrine prostate tumors. In addition, the interaction with the JMJD2A and JMJD2D epigenetic regulators may be important in the ability of ETV2 to reprogram cells, modulate normal and cancer stem cells, and affect spermatogenesis.""","""['Xiaomeng Li', 'Gene Moon', 'Sook Shin', 'Bin Zhang', 'Ralf Janknecht']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Cooperation between ETS transcription factor ETV1 and histone demethylase JMJD1A in colorectal cancer.', 'Histone demethylase JMJD2A drives prostate tumorigenesis through transcription factor ETV1.', 'Activation of androgen receptor by histone demethylases JMJD2A and JMJD2D.', 'KDM4/JMJD2 histone demethylases: epigenetic regulators in cancer cells.', 'The role of the histone demethylase KDM4A in cancer.', 'Epigenetic landscape reveals MECOM as an endothelial lineage regulator.', 'Promotion of colorectal cancer by transcription factor BHLHE40 involves upregulation of ADAM19 and KLF7.', 'ETV2 regulates PARP-1 binding protein to induce ER stress-mediated death in tuberin-deficient cells.', 'Sumoylation of transcription factor ETV1 modulates its oncogenic potential in prostate cancer.', 'Cooperation between ETS transcription factor ETV1 and histone demethylase JMJD1A in colorectal cancer.']"""

However, since PARP inhibitors (PARPi) mainly modulate the activation of PARP but not its expression, whether small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to PARP has the same function as PARPi has not been well defined. In the present study it was demonstrated that PARP1-siRNA could reduce prostate cancer (PCa) cell progression regardless of the BRCA1/2 mutation. PARP1 silencing could significantly inhibit PC3 cell migration and invasion. Additionally, PARP1-siRNA also inhibited the proliferation of PC3 and Du145 cells. After the induction of apoptosis by docetaxel, cleaved-caspase3 of DU145 and C4-2 cells increased significantly in the PARP1-siRNA group. In the xenograft nude mouse model, PARP1-siRNA could suppress xenograft tumor size of PC3 cells and produce a more regular morphology. In vitro and in vivo, PARP1 silencing significantly downregulated vimentin expression and upregulated E-cadherin expression, both of which are epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. It has been revealed that PI3K inhibition could sensitize the effect of PARPi. Notably, PARP1-siRNA could suppress the expression of EGFR and p-GSK3β (Ser9) in PCa cells, which was different from PARPi. Our results indicated that PARP1-siRNA can suppress the growth and invasion capacity of PCa cells, thereby suggesting that PARP1-siRNA, which is different from PARPi, may provide a potential treatment method for PCa.""","""['Yongchang Lai', 'Zhenzhen Kong', 'Tao Zeng', 'Shaohong Xu', 'Xiaolu Duan', 'Shujue Li', 'Chao Cai', 'Zhijian Zhao', 'Wenqi Wu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['A functional ex vivo assay to detect PARP1-EJ repair and radiosensitization by PARP-inhibitor in prostate cancer.', 'Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibition and anticancer activity of simmiparib, a new inhibitor undergoing clinical trials.', 'Genome-wide and high-density CRISPR-Cas9 screens identify point mutations in PARP1 causing PARP inhibitor resistance.', 'New Targeted Agents in Gynecologic Cancers: Synthetic Lethality, Homologous Recombination Deficiency, and PARP Inhibitors.', 'Therapeutic Targeting of Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1 (PARP1) in Cancer: Current Developments, Therapeutic Strategies, and Future Opportunities.', 'USP5 knockdown alleviates lung cancer progression via activating PARP1-mediated mTOR signaling pathway.', 'HECTD3 regulates the tumourigenesis of glioblastoma by polyubiquitinating PARP1 and activating EGFR signalling pathway.', 'Pre-Clinical and Clinical Applications of Small Interfering RNAs (siRNA) and Co-Delivery Systems for Pancreatic Cancer Therapy.', 'CMTM5 inhibits the development of prostate cancer via the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'Inhibition of PARP1 Dampens Pseudorabies Virus Infection through DNA Damage-Induced Antiviral Innate Immunity.']"""

Then the miRNA database was searched online and luciferase assay perform to understand the regulatory relationship between miR-132 and E2F5. Moreover, we also conducted real-time PCR and western blot analysis to study the mRNA and protein expression level of E2F5 among different groups (cancerous tissue, n=32; non-cancerous tissue, n=32) or cells treated with scramble control, miR-132 mimics, E2F5 siRNA and miR-132 inhibitors. miR-132 was upregulated in cancerous tissues of prostate cancer patients. E2F5 was the target of miR-132, and negative regulatory relationship between miR-132 and E2F5 was also confirmed by luciferase assay. The mRNA and protein expression level of E2F5 increased in cancerous tissue group. miR-132 decreased the expression of E2F5 in prostate cancer cells, and introduction of miR-132 reduced the viability and E2F5 and promoted the viability of prostate cancer cells. miR-132 inhibited apoptosis and E2F5 accelerated apoptosis. In conclusion, miR-132 was upregulated in cancerous tissue of prostate cancer.

Here, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of patient-derived PCa explants identified cytoskeletal organization as highly enriched with AUY922 treatment. Validation in PCa cell lines revealed that AUY922 caused marked alterations to cell morphology, and suppressed cell motility and invasion compared to vehicle or 17-AAG, concomitant with dysregulation of key extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin (FN1). Interestingly, while the expression of FN1 was increased by AUY922, FN1 secretion was significantly decreased. This resulted in cytosolic accumulation of FN1 protein within late endosomes, suggesting that AUY922 disrupts vesicular secretory trafficking pathways. Depletion of FN1 by siRNA knockdown markedly reduced the invasive capacity of PCa cells, phenocopying AUY922.

The clinical conundrum is that most men live with prostate cancer rather than die from it, while existing treatments have significant associated morbidity. Recent studies have shown very low mortality rates (1% after a median of 10-year follow-up) and no treatment-related reductions in mortality, in men with localised prostate cancer. This study will identify prognostic factors associated with prostate cancer progression to help differentiate aggressive from more indolent tumours in men with localised disease at diagnosis, and so inform the decision to adopt conservative (active surveillance) or radical (surgery or radiotherapy) management strategies.  Methods and analysis:   The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) contains 57 318 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 2016. These men will be linked to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service registry databases for mortality, TNM stage, Gleason grade and treatment data. Men with a diagnosis date prior to 1 January 1987 and men with lymph node or distant metastases at diagnosis will be excluded. A priori determined prognostic factors potentially associated with prostate cancer mortality, the end point of cancer progression, will be measured at baseline, and the participants followed through to development of cancer progression, death or the end of the follow-up period (31 December 2016). Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to estimate crude and mutually adjusted HRs. Mortality risk will be predicted using flexible parametric survival models that can accurately fit the shape of the hazard function.  Ethics and dissemination:   This study protocol has approval from the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee for the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Database Research (protocol 17_041).

Previous data indicates altered ER expression in oesophageal cancers (OC). However the role of ER subtypes and ER specific inhibitors in the regulation of OC progression remains unclear. This study sought to assess levels of ERα and ERβ in OC. The effects of highly selective ER antagonists on cell proliferation and apoptosis in two OC adenocarcinoma cell lines was also studied.  Methods:   ERα and ERβ expression profiling in paired normal oesophageal mucosa and tumour tissues (n = 34; adenocarcinoma n = 28; squamous cell carcinoma n = 6) was performed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Correlation between levels of ER with the clinico-pathological features for OC was determined. The effect of selective ER antagonists on proliferation of OE33 and OE19 OC cell lines was studied.  Results:   ERα and ERβ mRNA expression was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in tumour tissues relative to their paired normal mucosa and correlated inversely with survival outcome (p < 0.05). Upregulation of ERα mRNA correlated with higher pathological T-stage (p < 0.05) and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05) while ERβ mRNA upregulation correlated with positive vascular invasion (p < 0.05). A significant concentration-dependent inhibition of proliferation in OE33 and OE19 cell lines was induced by a highly-selective ERα antagonist (MPP) and an ERβ specific antagonist (PHTPP) (p < 0.05). Moreover, anti-oestrogens induced cell death through stimulation of apoptotic caspase activity.

We identified 4 randomized controlled trials (breast cancer, n=2; prostate cancer, n=2) measuring vascular endothelial function by FMD (n=3) or reactive hyperemia index (n=1), including 163 cancer survivors (exercise training, n=82; control, n=81). Aerobic exercise training improved vascular function (n=4 studies; standardized mean difference [95% CI]=0.65 [0.33, 0.96], I2=0%; FMD, weighted mean difference [WMD]=1.28 [0.22, 2.34], I2=23.2%) and peak exercise oxygen uptake (3 trials; WMD [95% CI]=2.22 [0.83, 3.61] mL/kg/min; I2=0%).

However, there is limited information on the impact of long-term metformin use on serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. We investigated the association between exposure to metformin and PSA levels among diabetic patients who were not previously diagnosed with PCa.  Methods:   The analytic sample consisted of 1363 US men aged above 40 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007 to 2008 cycle. Men who had previous diagnoses of PCa or prostatitis and men exposed to manipulations that might have affected PSA levels were excluded. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between PSA levels and metformin use by adjusting for potential confounders.  Results:   The mean PSA level of the overall population was 1.8 (standard deviation = 3.1) ng/mL. There were no differences in PSA levels according to the presence of diabetes (P = .517). Among patients with diabetes, metformin users exhibited significantly lower PSA levels compared with nonmetformin users (odds ratio = 0.790; 95% confidence interval 0.666-0.938; P = .007). However, no significant difference was found in PSA levels among men over duration of metformin use when levels were stratified by either 1 year or 5 years by Pearson's coefficient.  Conclusion:   A negative association between serum PSA levels and metformin use was observed in patients with diabetes. Duration of metformin use did not influence PSA levels. Further studies are warranted to elucidate whether the reduction in PSA level with metformin truly reflects reduced risk of PCa development and progression.""","""['Jee Soo Park', 'Kwang Suk Lee', 'Won Sik Ham', 'Byung Ha Chung', 'Kyo Chul Koo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Association Between Antidiabetic Medications and Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels and Biopsy Results.', 'Influence of metformin use on PSA values, free-to-total PSA, prostate cancer incidence and grade and overall survival in a prospective screening trial (ERSPC Aarau).', 'The Relationship Between Metformin and Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels.', 'Metformin use and prostate cancer risk.', 'Untangling the association between prostate-specific antigen and diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Natural Chemotherapeutic Capsaicin Activates AMPK through LKB1 Kinase and TRPV1 Receptors in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The Effect of Metformin on Male Reproductive Function and Prostate: An Updated Review.', 'Association Between Antidiabetic Medications and Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels and Biopsy Results.']"""

Methods:   This cohort study used Texas Cancer Registry-linked Medicare data from 2005 to 2011 for older patients diagnosed with breast (n = 19,082), prostate (n = 23,044), lung (n = 26,047), or colorectal cancer (n = 16,693). For each cancer cohort, the data were split into training and validation cohorts. In the training cohort, competing risk regression was used to model the association of Elixhauser comorbidities with 2-year noncancer mortality, and cancer-specific weights were derived for each comorbidity. In the validation cohort, competing risk regression was used to compare 3 versions of the Elixhauser comorbidity score with 3 versions of the Charlson comorbidity score. Model performance was evaluated with c statistics.  Results:   The 2-year noncancer mortality rates were 14.5% (lung cancer), 11.5% (colorectal cancer), 5.7% (breast cancer), and 4.1% (prostate cancer). Cancer-specific Elixhauser comorbidity scores (c = 0.773 for breast cancer, c = 0.772 for prostate cancer, c = 0.579 for lung cancer, and c = 0.680 for colorectal cancer) performed slightly better than cancer-specific Charlson comorbidity scores (ie, the National Cancer Institute combined index; c = 0.762 for breast cancer, c = 0.767 for prostate cancer, c = 0.578 for lung cancer, and c = 0.674 for colorectal cancer).

Methods:   Latinos previously diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer (N = 288) completed questionnaires (Patient Satisfaction with Cancer Care Scale, Stanford Chronic Disease Self-Management Measures, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, and Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics) within 2 years after receiving primary cancer treatment.  Results:   Path model analyses demonstrated that satisfaction with cancer care was associated with greater HRQOL and that this relationship was explained by several facets of self-efficacy (ie, confidence in managing psychological distress [z = 3.81; P<.001], social support from close others [z = 2.46; P = .014], social/recreational activities [z = 3.30; P = .001], and patient-provider communication [z = -3.72; P<.001]). Importantly, foreign-born, less acculturated, and monolingual Spanish-speaking survivors reported lower self-efficacy in patient-provider communication; however, adjusting for acculturation, language, nativity, and other covariates did not alter these results.  Conclusions:   Factors that contribute to disparities in HRQOL among Latino cancer survivors compared with non-Latino whites, such as low income, less education, and a lack of health insurance, can be difficult to address. The findings of the current study emphasize the importance of self-efficacy within the context of patient-centered cancer care practices (eg, patient inclusion in care decisions, sufficient time with provider, ready access to medical advice) and suggest that improving satisfaction with care may increase patients' confidence in managing important aspects of their cancer experience and, in turn, improve HRQOL among Latino cancer survivors.

We aimed to estimate the incidence of CRC and extracolonic cancers in IBD patients.  Methods:   In this case-control study, cases were all IBD patients treated in our Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital who developed CRC or extracolonic cancers between 1996 and 2015. Controls were patients in the general VA population who developed these cancers during the same time. We compared cancer incidence rates (IRs) in cases and controls.  Results:   There was no significant difference between cases and controls in the 20-year IR for CRC (148/100 000 in IBD patients, 97/100 000 in controls; relative risk [RR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86-2.69). In contrast, IBD cases had a significantly higher 20-year IR for all extracolonic cancers than controls (2839/100 000 in IBD patients, 1960/100 000 in controls; RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.27-1.65). Site-specific analyses revealed that IBD patients had significantly elevated risks for nonmelanoma skin cancers (RR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.99-2.85), melanoma skin cancers (RR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.63-4.88), renal tumors (RR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.46-5.84), prostate cancer (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.28-2.27), and pancreatic cancer (RR, 4.23; 95% CI, 1.35-13.29).  Conclusions:   The incidence of CRC was not significantly higher in our veteran patients with IBD than in control patients in the general VA population.

Targeting GCPII with inhibitor-bearing nanoparticles can enable recognition, imaging, and delivery of treatments to cancer cells. Compared to methods based on antibodies and other large biomolecules, inhibitor-mediated targeting benefits from the low molecular weight of the inhibitor molecules, which are typically stable, easy-to-handle, and able to bind the enzyme with very high affinity. Although GCPII is established as a molecular target, comparing previously reported results is difficult due to the different methodological approaches used. In this work, we investigate the robustness and limitations of GCPII targeting with a diverse range of inhibitor-bearing nanoparticles (various structures, sizes, bionanointerfaces, conjugation chemistry, and surface densities of attached inhibitors). Polymer-coated nanodiamonds, virus-like particles based on bacteriophage Qβ and mouse polyomavirus, and polymeric poly(HPMA) nanoparticles with inhibitors attached by different means were synthesized and characterized. We evaluated their ability to bind GCPII and interact with cancer cells using surface plasmon resonance, inhibition assay, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. Regardless of the diversity of the investigated nanosystems, they all strongly interact with GCPII (most with low picomolar Ki values) and effectively target GCPII-expressing cells. The robustness of this approach was limited only by the quality of the nanoparticle bionanointerface, which must be properly designed by adding a sufficient density of hydrophilic protective polymers.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that the silence of miR-203 contributes to the invasiveness of malignant breast cancer cells by targeting SNAI2. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of miR-203/SNAI2 axis in prostate cancer have not been elucidated. The aim of this study is to explore the effects of miR-203/SNAI2 axis on the biological characteristics of prostate carcinomas both in vitro and in vivo. We found that miR-203 was significantly downregulated in prostate cancer cell lines compared with immortalized prostate epithelial cells using semi-quantitative PCR and real-time PCR, as well as in clinical prostate cancer tissues compared to normal tissues using TCGA analysis. Functionally, miR-203 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, endothelial cell tube formation and cancer stemness in vitro. Meanwhile, overexpression of miR-203 suppressed SNAI2 expression both in DU145 and PC3 cells. In addition, the in vivo study showed that miR-203 suppressed tumorigenicity, metastasis and angiogenesis of DU145 cells. Ectopic expression of SNAI2 rescued the inhibitory effects of miR-203 both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the EMT markers CDH1 and VIMENTIN were modulated by the miR-203/SNAI2 axis. Furthermore, the GSK-3β/β-CATENIN signal pathway was suppressed by miR-203 and could be reactivated by SNAI2. Taken together, this research unveiled the function of miR-203/SNAI2 axis in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, stemness, metastasis and GSK-3β/β-CATENIN signal pathway in prostate cancer and gave insights into miR-203/SNAI2-targeting therapy for prostate cancer patients. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(3):224-236, 2018.""","""['Xinxin Tian', 'Fangfang Tao', 'Baotong Zhang', 'Jin-Tang Dong', 'Zhiqian Zhang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""IUBMB Life""","""['Inhibitory role of miR-203 in the angiogenesis of mice with pathological retinal neovascularization disease through downregulation of SNAI2.', 'MiR-429 Inhibits the Angiogenesis of Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells through SNAI2-Mediated GSK-3β/β-Catenin Pathway.', 'MiR-182 promotes prostate cancer progression through activating Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway.', 'Research progress of miRNAs targeting GSK-3β in regulation of hepatocellular carcinoma invasion and metastasis.', 'Molecular regulation of Snai2 in development and disease.', 'miR-203 drives breast cancer cell differentiation.', 'Identification of key molecules in miRNA-mRNA regulatory network associated with high-grade serous ovarian cancer recurrence using bioinformatic analysis.', 'Identification of candidate hub genes correlated with the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis of prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Identification of hub genes predicting the development of prostate cancer from benign prostate hyperplasia and analyzing their clinical value in prostate cancer by bioinformatic analysis.', 'Anti-tumor effect of HOTAIR-miR-613-SNAI2 axis through suppressing EMT and drug resistance in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   22 patients (mean age 62.6 years) with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent 1.5 T DTI before and after RP. The number, fractional anisotropy (FA) values and length of PNFs before and after RP were compared using Student's t-test. Each patient filled out two questionnaires before and after RP, one for the evaluation of urinary continence (ICIQ-SF) and one for the evaluation of erectile function (IIEF-5). The ratios of the number, FA values and length of PNFs before and after RP (DTI B-A RATIOs) and the ratios between the scores obtained before and after RP for both ICIQ-SF and IIEF-2 (ICIQ-SF B-A RATIOs and IIEF-2 B-A RATIOs) were calculated to perform the Kendall's τ-test between them.

Methods:   A Markov model of PCa onset and progression was developed to estimate the health and economic consequences of PCa screening with MRI. Patients underwent PSA screening from ages 55 to 69 years. Patients with elevated PSA concentrations (>4 ng/mL) underwent MRI, followed by targeted fusion or combined (standard + targeted fusion) biopsy on positive MRI, and standard or no biopsy on negative MRI. Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score on MRI was used to determine biopsy decisions. Deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated for each strategy.  Results:   With a negative MRI, standard biopsy was more expensive and had lower QALYs than performing no biopsy. The optimum screening strategy (ICER $23 483/QALY) recommended combined biopsy for patients with PI-RADS score ≥3 and no biopsy for patients with PI-RADS score <3, and reduced the number of screening biopsies by 15%. Threshold analysis suggests MRI continues to be cost-effective when the sensitivity and specificity of MRI and combined biopsy are simultaneously reduced by 19 percentage points.

Patients and methods:   Patients initiating first-line antiandrogen therapy (abiraterone, enzalutamide) or chemotherapy (taxane) between October 2012 and September 2014 were retrospectively identified in the US Veterans Health Administration database. The impact of antiandrogen therapy vs chemotherapy on overall survival (OS) and time to discontinuation was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for prior androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) duration and available prognostic factors.  Results:   Overall, 1445 patients were evaluable, of whom 1108 received antiandrogen therapy and 337 received chemotherapy (docetaxel). On multivariable analysis and propensity score analysis, the OS times for antiandrogen therapy vs chemotherapy were not significantly different (hazard ratio [HR] 1.041, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.853-1.270, P = 0.694, and HR 1.047, 95% CI 0.861-1.273, P = 0.644, respectively).

In this work, an electrochemical sensing method was devised to detect traces of PSA in human saliva using a hybrid nanocomposite of graphene nanoplatelets with diblock co-polymers and Au electrodes (GRP-PS67-b-PAA27-Au). The pure graphitic composition on filter paper provides significantly high electrical and thermal conductivity while PS67-b-PAA27 makes an amphiphilic bridge between GRP units. The sensor utilizes the binding of an anti-PSA antibody with an antigen-PSA to act as a resistor in a circuit providing an impedance change that in turn allows for the detection and quantification of PSA in saliva samples. A miniaturized electrical impedance analyzer was interfaced with a sensor chip and the data were recorded in real-time using a Bluetooth-enabled module. This fully integrated and optimized sensing device exhibited a wide PSA range of detection from 0.1 pg mL-1 to 100 ng mL-1 (R2 = 0.963) with a lower limit of detection of 40 fg mL-1. The performance of the biosensor chip was validated with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique with a regression coefficient as high as 0.940. The advantages of the newly developed saliva-PSA electrical biosensor over previously reported serum-PSA electrochemical biosensors include a faster response time (3-5 min) to achieve a stable electrical signal for PSA detection, high selectivity, improved sensitivity, no additional requirement of a redox electrolyte for electron exchange and excellent shelf life. The presented sensor is aimed for clinical commercialization to detect PSA in human saliva.""","""['M S Khan', 'K Dighe', 'Z Wang', 'I Srivastava', 'E Daza', 'A S Schwartz-Dual', 'J Ghannam', 'S K Misra', 'D Pan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['Paper-Based Analytical Biosensor Chip Designed from Graphene-Nanoplatelet-Amphiphilic-diblock-co-Polymer Composite for Cortisol Detection in Human Saliva.', 'Graphene nanocomposites modified electrochemical aptamer sensor for rapid and highly sensitive detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Triple sensitivity amplification for ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Nanomaterial-based biosensors for detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Electrochemical biosensors based on polymer nanocomposites for detecting breast cancer: Recent progress and future prospects.', 'Understanding bacterial biofilms: From definition to treatment strategies.', 'Saliva-based microfluidic point-of-care diagnostic.', ""Salivary inflammatory biomarkers are predictive of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in a feasibility study."", 'Small Molecule NIR-II Dyes for Switchable Photoluminescence via Host -Guest Complexation and Supramolecular Assembly with Carbon Dots.', 'Molecularly imprinted polymers via reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer synthesis in sensing and environmental applications.']"""

C57BL/6 male and female mice implanted with viable RM-1 cells represent a novel murine model of advanced prostate cancer for studying antitumor effects following immunization with a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-modified RM-1 cell vaccine, which has been described previously. In vitro cytotoxic activity and cytokine secretion experiments were conducted to investigate the antitumor response. The cytotoxicity profile of splenocytes from female mice immunized against RM-1 cells primarily involved cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lysis and, to a lesser extent, natural killer (NK) cell lysis. NK cell lysis was also observed in males, which exhibited no evidence of CTL lysis. The secretion of interferon-γ in the GM-CSF-modified cell vaccine group was significantly increased compared with the other groups. The level of interleukin-4 was low. To investigate the antitumor immune response further, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T cells and CD8 T cells were analyzed in the spleens and tumors of female mice receiving the GM-CSF-modified RM-1 cell vaccine. Unlike female mice, males exhibited the highest proportion of NK cells in the spleen. NK cells were not detected in the tumor tissue in any of the groups. The difference between the sexes may explain the specificity of the immune response, as females are intolerant to prostate antigens whereas males are.

In the present study, 3 target-specific 19-25 nucleotide maspin small interfering RNAs were designed and synthesized to knockdown maspin expression. The effects of COE on MGC-803/maspin- cell proliferation were evaluated by the MTT assay. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Invasive activity was measured with the Transwell assay and the associated molecular mechanisms were assessed by western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that COE significantly promoted the expression of maspin (P<0.01) to induce apoptosis and inhibit invasion and migration in MGC803 cells. The expression levels of phosphorylated (p)-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospho-extracellular regulated protein kinase (Erk), B cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein and caspase-3 were increased in the MGC-803/maspin- cells in a dose-dependent manner. The Erk, B-cell lymphoma 2, p-Akt, Akt and p-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein in MGC-803/maspin- cells were reduced in a dose-dependent manner. This indicated that COE may inhibit invasion and migration through phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways in MGC-803/maspin- cells.

The results developed with aptasensor and anti-PSA is also checked through the detection of PSA in real samples with acceptable results. Our study suggests some advantages of aptasensor in terms of better stability, simplicity and cost effectiveness. Further our present work shows enormous potential of our developed sensors for real application using voltammetric and EIS techniques simultaneous to get reliable detection of the disease.""","""['Monika Srivastava', 'Narsingh R Nirala', 'S K Srivastava', 'Rajiv Prakash']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['The electrochemical detection of prostate specific antigen on glassy carbon electrode modified with combinations of graphene quantum dots, cobalt phthalocyanine and an aptamer.', 'Electrochemical bioassay development for ultrasensitive aptasensing of prostate specific antigen.', 'Label-free electrochemical aptasensor for progesterone detection in biological fluids.', 'Nanomaterial based aptasensing of prostate specific antigen (PSA): Recent progress and challenges in efficient diagnosis of prostate cancer using biomedicine.', 'Application of various optical and electrochemical aptasensors for detection of human prostate specific antigen: A review.', 'Electrochemical aptasensor based on the engineered core-shell MOF nanostructures for the detection of tumor antigens.', 'A compact, low-cost, and binary sensing (BiSense) platform for noise-free and self-validated impedimetric detection of COVID-19 infected patients.', 'Aptasensors versus immunosensors-Which will prevail?', 'Detection of Low Density Lipoprotein-Comparison of Electrochemical Immuno- and Aptasensor.', 'Development of a Soluble KIT Electrochemical Aptasensor for Cancer Theranostics.']"""

Androgens can regulate transcriptional expression including reference gene expression in prostate cancer. In this study, we evaluated ten mRNA and six non-protein coding RNA reference genes in five prostate cell lines under varied dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatments. We validated the effects of DHT-treatments using media containing charcoal-stripped serum prior to DHT stimulation on the test samples by Western blot experiments. Reference gene expression stability was analysed using three programs (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper), and the recommended comprehensive ranking is provided. Our results reveal that ACTB and GAPDH, and miR-16 and miR-1228-3p are the most suitable mRNA and miRNA reference genes across all cell lines, respectively. Considering prostate cancer cell types, ACTB/GAPDH and ACTB/HPRT1 are the most suitable reference gene combinations for mRNA analysis, and miR-16/miR-1228-3p and RNU6-2/RNU43 for miRNA analysis in AR+, and AR- and normal cell lines, respectively. Comparison of relative target gene (PCA3 and miR-141) expression reveals different patterns depending on reference genes used for normalisation.

Objective:   The goal of our research was to assess the effectiveness of an individualized Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention on improving psychological and quality of life outcomes in cancer patients with elevated psychological distress.  Methods:   A total of 163 distressed cancer patients (111 female, 68.1%) were recruited through the Queensland Cancer Registry and the Cancer Council Queensland Cancer Helpline and randomly assigned to either a Web-based tailored CBT intervention (CancerCope) (79/163) or a static patient education website (84/163). At baseline and 8-week follow-up we assessed primary outcomes of psychological and cancer-specific distress and unmet psychological supportive care needs and secondary outcomes of positive adjustment and quality of life.  Results:   Intention-to-treat analyses showed no evidence of a statistically significant intervention effect on primary or secondary outcomes. However, per-protocol analyses found a greater decrease for the CancerCope group in psychological distress (P=.04), cancer-specific distress (P=.02), and unmet psychological care needs (P=.03) from baseline to 8 weeks compared with the patient education group. Younger patients were more likely to complete the CancerCope intervention.  Conclusions:   This online CBT intervention was associated with greater decreases in distress for those patients who more closely adhered to the program. Given the low costs and high accessibility of this intervention approach, even if only effective for subgroups of patients, the potential impact may be substantial.

Despite that sophisticated techniques of radiotherapy and radiation combined with chemotherapy were applied to the patients, some tumors may recur. Therefore, the study investigated the effect of dihydroisotanshinone I (DT) and the combination treatment of 5 μM DT and 5Gy irradiation (IR) against the migration ability of prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   DT and the combination treatment were studied for its biological activity against migration ability of prostate cancer cells with transwell migration assay. Subsequently, we tried to explore the underlying mechanism with ELISA, flow cytometry and Western's blotting assay.  Results:   The results showed that DT and the combination treatment substantially inhibited the migration ability of prostate cancer cells. DT and the combined treatment can decrease the ability of macrophages to recruit prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, DT and the combination treatment reduced the secretion of chemokine (C-C Motif) Ligand 2 (CCL2) from prostate cancer cells. We also found that DT treatment induced the cell cycle of prostate cancer cells entering S phase and increased the protein expression of DNA damage response proteins (rH2AX and phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia-mutated [ATM]) in DU145 cells and PC-3 cells.  Conclusions:   DT displays radiosensitization and antimigration effects in prostate cancer cells by inducing DNA damage and inhibiting CCL2 secretion.

Methods and results:   Lentivirus-mediated shRNA knockdown of Setd7 in LNCaP and PC-3 cells decreases the expression of downstream Nrf2 targets, such as NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1) and glutathione S-transferase theta 2 (Gstt2). Downregulation of Setd7 decreases soft agar colony formation ability of PCa cells. Knockdown of Setd7 increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Furthermore, Setd7 knockdown attenuates Nqo1 and Gstt2 expression in response to H2 O2 challenge, whereas increased DNA damage is observed in Setd7 knockdown cells in comet assay. Interestingly, Setd7 expression could be induced by the dietary phytochemicals PEITC and UA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays show that Setd7 knockdown decreased H3K4me1 enrichment in the Nrf2 and Gstt2 promoter regions, while PEITC and UA treatments elevated the enrichment.  Conclusion:   Taken together, these results indicate that Setd7 knockdown decreases Nrf2 and Nrf2-target genes expression and that PEITC and UA induce Setd7 expression, which activates the Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway and protects DNA from oxidative damage.""","""['Chao Wang', 'Limin Shu', 'Chengyue Zhang', 'Wenji Li', 'Renyi Wu', 'Yue Guo', 'Yuqing Yang', 'Ah-Ng Kong']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Nutr Food Res""","""['Inhibition of SETD7 protects cardiomyocytes against hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced injury through regulating Keap1/Nrf2 signaling.', 'Transcriptomic Analysis of Histone Methyltransferase Setd7 Knockdown and Phenethyl Isothiocyanate in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Lysine Methyltransferase SETD7 (SET7/9) Regulates ROS Signaling through mitochondria and NFE2L2/ARE pathway.', 'The Nrf2-antioxidant response element pathway: a target for regulating energy metabolism.', 'A perspective on dietary phytochemicals and cancer chemoprevention: oxidative stress, nrf2, and epigenomics.', 'Epigenetic regulation and therapeutic targets in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Methyltransferase Set7/9 as a Multifaceted Regulator of ROS Response.', 'Ursolic Acid against Prostate and Urogenital Cancers: A Review of In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.', 'Prospective Epigenetic Actions of Organo-Sulfur Compounds against Cancer: Perspectives and Molecular Mechanisms.', 'A New Frontier in Studying Dietary Phytochemicals in Cancer and in Health: Metabolic and Epigenetic Reprogramming.']"""

In initial stages of the disease, TGFβ acts as a growth inhibitor upon tumor cells, whereas it in later stages of disease rather promotes invasion and metastatic potential. One well-known cellular source of TGFβ in the bone metastatic site is the bone-forming osteoblasts. Here we have studied the effects by osteoblast-derived factors on metastatic potential in several human prostate cancer cell lines.  Methods:   Effects on metastatic potential in prostate cancer cells by osteoblast-derived factors were studied in vitro using several methods, including Transwell migration and evaluation of formation of pro-migratory protrusions. Confocal microscopy was used to evaluate possible changes in differentiation state in tumor cells by analysis of markers for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The Matrigel-on-top 3D culture method was used for further assessment of metastatic characteristics in tumor cells by analysis of formation of filopodium-like protrusions (FLPs).  Results:   Osteoblast-derived factors increased migration of PC-3U cells, an effect less prominent in cells overexpressing a mutated type I TGFβ receptor (TβRI) preventing non-canonical TRAF6-dependent TGFβ signaling. Osteoblast-derived factors also increased the formation of long protrusions and loss of cell-cell contacts in PC-3U cells, suggesting induction of a more aggressive phenotype. In addition, treatment with TGFβ or osteoblast-derived factors of PC-3U cells in Matrigel-on-top 3D cultures promoted formation of FLPs, previously shown to be essential for metastatic establishment.  Conclusions:   These findings suggests that factors secreted from osteoblasts, including TGFβ, can induce several cellular traits involved in metastatic potential of PC-3U cells, further strengthening the role for bone cells to promote metastatic tumor cell behavior.""","""['Terese Karlsson', 'Reshma Sundar', 'Anders Widmark', 'Maréne Landström', 'Emma Persson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Transforming growth factor beta derived from bone matrix promotes cell proliferation of prostate cancer and osteoclast activation-associated osteolysis in the bone microenvironment.', 'Prostate cancer cells regulate growth and differentiation of bone marrow endothelial cells through TGFbeta and its receptor, TGFbetaRII.', 'TGFβ-induced phosphorylation of Par6 promotes migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells.', 'Reprogramming during epithelial to mesenchymal transition under the control of TGFβ.', 'TGF-BETA IN THE NATURAL HISTORY OF PROSTATE CANCER.', 'The link between bone-derived factors osteocalcin, fibroblast growth factor 23, sclerostin, lipocalin 2 and tumor bone metastasis.', 'Cx43 Present at the Leading Edge Membrane Governs Promigratory Effects of Osteoblast-Conditioned Medium on Human Prostate Cancer Cells in the Context of Bone Metastasis.', 'Osteoblasts are ""educated"" by crosstalk with metastatic breast cancer cells in the bone tumor microenvironment.', 'A ""Connexin"" Responsible for the Fatal Attraction of Cancer to Bone.', 'The regulatory roles of lncRNAs in the process of breast cancer invasion and metastasis.']"""

Methods:   Men who had a prostate biopsy due to an abnormal screening test were recruited. Linear regression was used to examine the association between miRNAs in plasma and PC status and to model individual miRNA expression on serum PSA and age to calculate the partial correlation coefficient (r).  Results:   There were 134 men, aged 46-86 years, included, with 66 men with a PC diagnosis (cases), eight men with no PC diagnosis but atypical lesion, and 60 men without a PC diagnosis (controls).

Methods:   We identified patients who underwent prostatectomy and AUS placement in SEER-Medicare from 2002 to 2011. We analyzed factors affecting the time of reoperation from AUS implantation and prostatectomy using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   In total, 841 men underwent AUS placement at a median 23 months after prostatectomy. Patients who underwent reoperation (28.5%) had higher clinical stage, more likely underwent open prostatectomy, or had prior sling placement (p < 0.03). There were no differences in rates of diabetes, smoking status, prior radiation therapy, or Charlson Comorbidity Index between those requiring reoperation vs. not (all p > 0.15). Patients with AUS placement > 15 months after prostatectomy (75%) initially experienced less need for operative reinterventions. Patients with later AUS placement were significantly more likely to have received radiation therapy [22.9 vs. 3.8% (p < 0.01)]. Nonetheless, late implantation was confirmed to be protective on multivariate analysis during the first 5 years after AUS placement [HR 0.79 (95% CI 0.67-0.92); p < 0.01]. Factors independently associated with a shorter interval time until reoperation included history of radiation [HR 1.93 (95% CI 1.33-2.80); p < 0.01] and history of prior sling [HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.08-2.68); p = 0.02]. Even for patients who underwent radiation therapy, delayed AUS implantation reduced reoperative risk.  Conclusions:   Late AUS implantation in the Medicare population is associated with prolonged device survival initially, while radiation and prior sling surgery predict for earlier reoperation. Patients with delayed AUS implantation experience less immediate complications. Further work is required to identify patient-specific factors which may explain variability in timing for AUS.""","""['Andrew Jason Cohen', 'Kristine Kuchta', 'Sangtae Park', 'Jaclyn Milose']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Re: Patterns and Timing of Artificial Urinary Sphincter Failure.', 'Artificial urinary sphincter longevity following transurethral resection of the prostate in the setting of prostate cancer.', 'Artificial urinary sphincter for urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: a historical cohort from 2004 to 2015.', 'Artificial urinary sphincter significantly better than fixed sling for moderate post-prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence: a propensity score-matched study.', 'Two-stage management of severe postprostatectomy bladder neck contracture associated with stress incontinence.', 'Surgery for stress urinary incontinence due to presumed sphincter deficiency after prostate surgery.', 'Impact of Radiation Therapy on Outcomes of Artificial Urinary Sphincter: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Peri-operative outcomes between primary and replacement artificial urinary sphincter surgery: An ACS-NSQIP analysis.', 'Urethral atrophy is now a rare cause for artificial urinary sphincter revision surgery in the contemporary 3.5 cm cuff era.', 'Fundamentals of prosthetic urology.', 'Artificial urinary sphincter longevity following transurethral resection of the prostate in the setting of prostate cancer.']"""

Here, we have investigated the effect of BPA in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells and in human non-transformed epithelial prostate EPN cells. Our data showed that BPA induces the down regulation of cyclin D1 expression and the upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27, leading to cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, we found that the BPA anti-proliferative response depends on a strong and rapid activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which stimulates ERK-dependent pathway. This, in turn, induces expression of p53 and its phosphorylation on residue Ser15, which is responsible for cell cycle arrest. EGFR activation occurs upon a cross talk with androgen (AR) and estradiol receptor-β (ERβ) which are known to bind BPA. Altogether, these findings show a novel signaling pathway in which EGFR activation plays a key role on BPA-induced cell cycle inhibition through a pathway involving AR and ERβ/EGFR complexes, ERK and p53. Our results provide new insights for understanding the molecular mechanisms in human prostate cancer. On the other, they could allow the development of new compounds that may be used to overcome human prostate cancer resistance to endocrine therapy in promising target therapeutic approaches.""","""['Antonio Bilancio#', 'Paola Bontempo#', 'Marzia Di Donato#', 'Mariarosaria Conte', 'Pia Giovannelli', 'Lucia Altucci', 'Antimo Migliaccio', 'Gabriella Castoria']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Activation of p53 signaling and inhibition of androgen receptor mediate tanshinone IIA induced G1 arrest in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'A cross-talk between the androgen receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor leads to p38MAPK-dependent activation of mTOR and cyclinD1 expression in prostate and lung cancer cells.', 'Crosstalk between androgen receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor-signalling pathways: a molecular switch for epithelial cell differentiation.', 'Benzopyran derivative CDRI-85/287 induces G2-M arrest in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells via modulation of estrogen receptors α- and β-mediated signaling, in parallel to EGFR signaling and suppresses the growth of tumor xenograft.', 'Roles of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in cell growth, malignant transformation and drug resistance.', 'Inhibition of Vps34 and p110δ PI3K Impairs Migration, Invasion and Three-Dimensional Spheroid Growth in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Bisphenol A Analogues Suppress Spheroid Attachment on Human Endometrial Epithelial Cells through Modulation of Steroid Hormone Receptors Signaling Pathway.', 'Rutin Mediated Apoptotic Cell Death in Caski Cervical Cancer Cells via Notch-1 and Hes-1 Downregulation.', 'Effects of bisphenol A on apoptosis of ovarian preantral follicular granulosa cells and ovarian development in mice.', 'The prostaglandin synthases, COX-2 and L-PGDS, mediate prostate hyperplasia induced by low-dose bisphenol A.']"""

Pretreatment with ROS inhibitor N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) blocked CT-induced apoptosis. CT increased p-JNK and p-p38, and decreased p-ERK and p-STAT3 protein expression, these effects were prevented by NAC. Furthermore, a xenograft assay showed that CT significantly inhibited MKN-45 cell-induced tumor growth in vivo by increasing expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (p-JNK, p-38 and cleaved-caspase-3) and reducing expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (p-ERK and p-STAT3) without adverse effects on nude mice weight.

The 2,400 men were invited to undergo screening, of whom 1,779 (74%) accepted and were examined with digital rectal examination, ultrasound and prostate specific antigen measurement. Biopsy was performed if there were suspicious findings on ultrasound or digital rectal examination, or prostate specific antigen was greater than 10 ng/ml.

Conclusions:   A single screening intervention in men 50 to 75 years old using prostate specific antigen, digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasound, and a prostate specific antigen cutoff of 10 ng/ml for biopsy carried a significant risk of prostate cancer detection without a concomitant reduction in prostate cancer specific mortality after 20 years.

Materials and methods:   We queried a prospectively maintained, single institution database to identify patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy and concurrent systematic sextant biopsy of magnetic resonance imaging negative regions between January 2013 and May 2016. All multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging targets were reviewed retrospectively by 2 readers for the PI-RADS™ (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System), version 2 score, the maximum dimension, the apparent diffusion coefficient parameter and whether positive or negative on dynamic contrast enhancement sequence. Biopsy slides were reviewed by 2 urological pathologists for Gleason score/Grade Group and the presence or absence of an intraductal/cribriform pattern.  Results:   A total of 154 patients were included in study. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy and systematic sextant biopsy of magnetic resonance imaging negative regions were negative for prostate carcinoma in 51 patients, leaving 103 available for the correlation of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and the intraductal/cribriform pattern. Prostate carcinoma was identified by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy in 93 cases and by systematic sextant biopsy of magnetic resonance imaging negative regions in 76 (p = 0.008). Intraductal/cribriform positive tumor was detected in 23 cases, including at the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy site in 22 and at the systematic sextant biopsy of magnetic resonance imaging negative region site in 3 (p <0.001).

We tested whether the migrated macrophages affect the susceptibility of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cells to cytotoxic actions of natural killer (NK) cells. We found treatment of tumor cells with the conditioned media (CM) of the PMA/IL-4 treated THP-1 cells (M2 type macrophages) (THP-1 CM) decreased the susceptibility of tumor cells to NK cell cytotoxicity, as a result of increased programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) and decreased NK group 2D (NKG2D) ligands in CRPC cells. Meanwhile, the decreased susceptibility of tumor cells was also detected when NK cells were treated with THP-1 CM and used in NK cell cytotoxicity tests. Therefore, we observed higher resistance of CRPC cells when both tumor and NK cells were treated with THP-1 CM than when tumor cells or NK cells were individually treated. We further discovered that the PMA/IL-4 treated THP-1 cells secrete a high level of IL-6, so blocking the IL-6 action significantly decreased the PD-L1 level while recovering the NKG2D ligands, thus increasing the susceptibility of CRPC cells to NK cell action. Moreover, we discovered that JAK-Stat3 is the most critical IL-6 downstream signaling in triggering the THP-1 CM effect. Consequently, we found the susceptibility of CRPC cells to NK cells was increased when either JAK or Stat 3 inhibitor was added when tumor cells were treated with THP-1 CM, and that the best effect was observed when the JAK inhibitor and PD-L1 Ab were added together.""","""['Lijun Xu', 'Mingjing Shen', 'Xiaodong Chen', 'Dong-Rong Yang', 'Ying Tsai', 'Peter C Keng', 'Soo Ok Lee', 'Yuhchyau Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Corrigendum to ""In vitro-induced M2 type macrophages induces the resistance of prostate cancer cells to cytotoxic action of NK cells""Exp Cell Res 364 (2018) 113-123.', 'Adipocytes affect castration-resistant prostate cancer cells to develop the resistance to cytotoxic action of NK cells with alterations of PD-L1/NKG2D ligand levels in tumor cells.', 'Increased infiltration of macrophages to radioresistant lung cancer cells contributes to the development of the additional resistance of tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of NK cells.', 'Inhibition of IL-6-JAK/Stat3 signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells enhances the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity via alteration of PD-L1/NKG2D ligand levels.', 'Combined inhibition of JAK1,2/Stat3‑PD‑L1 signaling pathway suppresses the immune escape of castration‑resistant prostate cancer to NK cells in hypoxia.', 'IL-6 produced by prostate epithelial cells stimulated with Trichomonas vaginalis\xa0promotes proliferation of prostate cancer cells by inducing M2 polarization of THP-1-derived macrophages.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

However, individual glycoproteins, which might serve as potential cancer markers, often are very low-concentrated in complex serum matrices and distinct glycan structures are hard to detect by immunoassays. Here, we present a mass spectrometry-based strategy for the simultaneous analysis of core-fucosylated and total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in human serum in the low ng/ml concentration range. Sample preparation comprised an immunoaffinity capture step to enrich total PSA from human serum using anti-PSA antibody coated magnetic beads followed by consecutive two-step on-bead partial deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F3 and tryptic digestion prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. The method was shown to be linear from 0.5 to 60 ng/ml total PSA concentrations and allows the simultaneous quantification of core-fucosylated PSA down to 1 ng/ml and total PSA lower than 0.5 ng/ml. The imprecision of the method over two days ranged from 9.7-23.2% for core-fucosylated PSA and 10.3-18.3% for total PSA depending on the PSA level. The feasibility of the method in native sera was shown using three human specimens. To our knowledge, this is the first MS-based method for quantification of core-fucosylated PSA in the low ng/ml concentration range in human serum. This method could be used in large patient cohorts as core-fucosylated PSA may be a diagnostic biomarker for the differentiation of prostate cancer and other prostatic diseases, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Furthermore, the described strategy could be used to monitor potential changes in site-specific core-fucosylation of other low-concentrated glycoproteins, which could serve as more specific markers (""marker refinement"") in cancer research.""","""['Robert Lang', 'Andreas Leinenbach', 'Johann Karl', 'Magdalena Swiatek-de Lange', 'Uwe Kobold', 'Michael Vogeser']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Chim Acta""","""['Investigation on core-fucosylated prostate-specific antigen as a refined biomarker for differentiation of benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer of different aggressiveness.', 'Label-free relative quantification of alpha-2-macroglobulin site-specific core-fucosylation in pancreatic cancer by LC-MS/MS.', 'Serum fucosylated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) improves the differentiation of aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancers.', 'Tumor-associated forms of prostate specific antigen improve the discrimination of prostate cancer from benign disease.', 'Narrative review of urinary glycan biomarkers in prostate cancer.', 'Differential analysis of core-fucosylated glycoproteomics enabled by single-step truncation of N-glycans.', 'FUT8 and Protein Core Fucosylation in Tumours: From Diagnosis to Treatment.', 'Prostate-specific antigen glycoprofiling as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of prostate cancer.']"""

It has recently been shown that KDM2B co-operates with Polycomb Group proteins to promote cell migration and angiogenesis in tumors. In the present study we addressed the role of KDM2B in regulating actin cytoskeleton signaling, cell-cell adhesion and migration of prostate tumor cells. We report here that KDM2B is functionally expressed in DU-145 prostate cancer cells, activated by FGF-2 and regulates EZH2. KDM2B knockdown induced potent up-regulation of gene transcription and protein expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and ZO-1, while KDM2B overexpression down-regulated the levels of both markers, suggesting control of cell adhesion by KDM2B. RhoA and RhoB protein expression and activity were diminished upon KDM2B-knockdown and upregulated in KDM2B-overexpressing cell clones. In accordance, actin reorganization with formation of stress fibers became evident in KDM2B-overexpressing cells and abolished in the presence of the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase. DU-145 cell migration was significantly enhanced in KDM2B overexpressing cells and abolished in C3-pretreated cells. Conversely, the retardation of cell migration observed in KDM2B knockdown cells was enhanced in C3-pretreated cells.

GS from invasive needle biopsies suffers from significant inter-observer variability and possible sampling error, leading to underestimating disease severity (""underscoring"") and can result in possible complications. A robust non-invasive image-based approach is, therefore, needed.  Purpose:   Use spatially registered multi-parametric MRI (MP-MRI), signatures, and supervised target detection algorithms (STDA) to non-invasively GS PCa at the voxel level.  Methods and materials:   This study retrospectively analyzed 26 MP-MRI from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The MP-MRI (T2, Diffusion Weighted, Dynamic Contrast Enhanced) were spatially registered to each other, combined into stacks, and stitched together to form hypercubes. Multi-parametric (or multi-spectral) signatures derived from a training set of registered MP-MRI were transformed using statistics-based Whitening-Dewhitening (WD). Transformed signatures were inserted into STDA (having conical decision surfaces) applied to registered MP-MRI determined the tumor GS. The MRI-derived GS was quantitatively compared to the pathologist's assessment of the histology of sectioned whole mount prostates from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. In addition, a meta-analysis of 17 studies of needle biopsy determined GS with confusion matrices and was compared to the MRI-determined GS.  Results:   STDA and histology determined GS are highly correlated (R = 0.86, p < 0.02). STDA more accurately determined GS and reduced GS underscoring of PCa relative to needle biopsy as summarized by meta-analysis (p < 0.05).

Yet their medicinal applications are hindered by insufficient potency for chemotherapy. Hence, a series of novel enmein-type diterpenoid hybrids coupled with nitrogen mustards were designed and synthesized to increase antitumor efficacy while reducing systemic toxicity. Most conjugates exhibited stronger antiproliferative activities than parent diterpenoids and nitrogen mustards, especially for multidrug-resistant tumor cell line Bel-7402/5-FU. Among them, compound E2 showed the most potent inhibitory activities in human leukemia HL-60 cells, human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, human liver cancer Bel-7402 cells and drug-resistant human liver cancer Bel-7402/5-FU cells with IC50 values of 7.83 μM, 3.97 μM, 0.77 μM and 2.07 μM, respectively. Additionally, high selectivity with selectivity index over 130 was also observed from cytotoxic evaluation between L-02 human normal liver cells and Bel-7402 malignant liver cells. Further studies on mechanism of action indicated that E2 induced both apoptosis and G1 phase cell cycle arrest in Bel-7402 hepatoma cells. Moreover, the dysfunction in mitochondrial pathway was also involved in E2 initiated apoptotic activation, which entailed the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential followed by upregulating the bax/bcl-2 ratio and increasing the expression of cytochrome c, p53, caspase-3 and -9.

We believe that insisting on a screening test for cancer diagnosis in donors' organs is important.  Materials and methods:   Data were collected between January 2010 and July 2015 from Ajou University Hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the PSA levels and prostate biopsy results in 111 male brain-dead organ donors (mean age, 48.4 years).  Results:   The mean PSA level was 7.395 ng/mL (range, 0.062 to 61.780; reference, 0 to 4 ng/mL). Ultrasonography or computed tomographic examination did not reveal prostate cancer, and a rectal examination was not performed. After checking the PSA levels, prostate biopsies were performed in 16 patients based on the recommendations of a urologist, and 4 patients (3.6% of 111) were diagnosed with prostate cancer. All cancers involved adenocarcinomas (acinar type) histopathologically. In 2 patients, the Gleason score was 6 (3 + 3), whereas the other 2 showed a score of 7 (3 + 4). Among the patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, 1 donated his liver and corneas, and the remaining 3 could not donate.  Conclusion:   Well-defined cancer screening tests are needed in Korea.

A PSA-AV score of 400 had a sensitivity and specificity of 93.7% and 40.0%, respectively. In conclusion, the PSA-AV score performed equally with PSAD and was better than PSA in predicting PCa. This indicated that PSA-AV score could be a useful tool for predicting PCa in Chinese population.""","""['Yi-Shuo Wu', 'Xiao-Bo Wu', 'Ning Zhang', 'Guang-Liang Jiang', 'Yang Yu', 'Shi-Jun Tong', 'Hao-Wen Jiang', 'Shan-Hua Mao', 'Rong Na', 'Qiang Ding']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Utility of the transition zone index for identification of prostate cancer in Chinese men with intermediate PSA levels.', 'Peripheral zone PSA density: a predominant variable to improve prostate cancer detection efficiency in men with PSA higher than 4 ng ml-1.', 'Age-specific prostate specific antigen cutoffs for guiding biopsy decision in Chinese population.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Prospective evaluation of prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density in the detection of nonpalpable and stage T1C carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Value of serum free prostate-specific antigen density in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'The influence of prostate volume on clinical parameters in prostate cancer screening.', 'Immunohistochemical investigation of cytokine expression levels as biomarkers in transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy specimens of prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'PI-RADS version 2.1 scoring system is superior in detecting transition zone prostate cancer: a diagnostic study.', 'Epidemiological and Economic Evaluation of a Pilot Prostate Cancer Screening Program.']"""

Moreover, recent advances in MRI enable treatment of cancer without computed tomography (CT) simulation. A commercially available MR-only solution, MRCAT, offers a single-modality approach that provides density information for dose calculation and generation of positioning reference images. We evaluated the accuracy of patient positioning based on MRCAT digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) by comparing to standard CT based workflow.  Materials and methods:   Twenty consecutive prostate cancer patients being treated with external beam radiation therapy were included in the study. DRRs were generated for each patient based on the planning CT and MRCAT. The accuracy assessment was performed by manually registering the DRR images to planar kV setup images using bony landmarks. A Bayesian linear mixed effects model was used to separate systematic and random components (inter- and intra-observer variation) in the assessment. In addition, method agreement was assessed using a Bland-Altman analysis.  Results:   The systematic difference between MRCAT and CT based patient positioning, averaged over the study population, were found to be (mean [95% CI]) -0.49 [-0.85 to -0.13] mm, 0.11 [-0.33 to +0.57] mm and -0.05 [-0.23 to +0.36] mm in vertical, longitudinal and lateral directions, respectively. The increases in total random uncertainty were estimated to be below 0.5 mm for all directions, when using MR-only workflow instead of CT.  Conclusions:   The MRCAT pseudo-CT method provides clinically acceptable accuracy and precision for patient positioning for pelvic radiation therapy based on planar DRR images. Furthermore, due to the reduction of geometric uncertainty, compared to dual-modality workflow, the approach is likely to improve the total geometric accuracy of pelvic radiation therapy.""","""['R Kemppainen', 'T Vaara', 'T Joensuu', 'T Kiljunen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Clinical workflow for MR-only simulation and planning in prostate.', 'Feasibility of MRI-based reference images for image-guided radiotherapy of the pelvis with either cone-beam computed tomography or planar localization images.', 'Automatic Substitute Computed Tomography Generation and Contouring for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Alone External Beam Radiation Therapy From Standard MRI Sequences.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'MRI-only treatment planning: benefits and challenges.', 'Feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging-only rectum radiotherapy with a commercial synthetic computed tomography generation solution.', 'Assessment of dosimetric and positioning accuracy of a magnetic resonance imaging-only solution for external beam radiotherapy of pelvic anatomy.', 'The rationale for MR-only treatment planning for external radiotherapy.', 'Role and future of MRI in radiation oncology.']"""

Five prostate cancer patients treated with VMAT were selected for dosimetric analysis. On the original computed tomography images, nine artificial body contours were created to reflect progressive WT changes. Combined with three different photon energies (6, 10, and 15-MV), 27 comparable virtual VMAT plans were created per patient. The dosimetric analysis included evaluation of target coverage (D95%, Dmax), conformity index, homogeneity index, and organs at risk doses. The dose differences among the plans were determined using the gamma index analysis and were compared with the dosimetric analysis. Mean D95% became lower than 98% when body contour expanded by 2.0 cm or more and Dmax became higher than 107% when body contour contracted by 1.5 cm or more in 10-MV plans.

Supporting such a role, CAV1 knockdown led to growth arrest and inhibition of cell invasion in prostate cancer cell lines.

BMI1 is upregulated in multiple types of cancer, including prostate cancer. As a key component of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), BMI1 exerts its oncogenic functions by enhancing the enzymatic activities of RING1B to ubiquitinate histone H2A at lysine 119 and repress gene transcription. Here, we report a PRC1-independent role of BMI1 that is critical for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progression. BMI1 binds the androgen receptor (AR) and prevents MDM2-mediated AR protein degradation, resulting in sustained AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. More importantly, we demonstrate that targeting BMI1 effectively inhibits tumor growth of xenografts that have developed resistance to surgical castration and enzalutamide treatment.

Objective:   To describe a novel approach for apical dissection, the collar technique, to reduce apical positive surgical margins (PSMs).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 189 consecutive patients (81 in the control group, 108 in the collar technique group) underwent RARP at a single center.  Primary outcome:   rates of apical PSMs; secondary outcome: urinary continence.  Intervention:   The urethral sphincter complex is incised 2-3mm distally to the apex, to stay farther from it and reduce PSMs; the underlying smooth muscle is exposed and incised closer to the apex to preserve the maximal length of the lissosphincter.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests compared median and proportions between the two groups, respectively. Univariate logistic regression tested the association between technique employed and risk of apical PSMs.  Results and limitations:   Fourteen patients (7.4%) revealed apical PSMs (9.9% in the control group, 5.6% in the collar group; p=0.7). When the collar technique was used, significantly lower rates of apical PSMs occurred in pT2 disease (0% vs 7.1%; p=0.03). In case of apical tumor at preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; n=43), the collar technique determined significantly lower overall (9.7% vs 42%) and apical (3.2% vs 42%) PSMs (all p≤0.02). Continence recovery in the collar and control groups was similar. When preoperative MRI showed an apical tumor, the collar technique had a significantly lower risk of apical PSMs (odds ratio: 0.05, p=0.009).  Conclusions:   The collar technique reduces the rates of apical PSMs in case of apical tumor, preserving the length of the lissosphincter.

Aberrant organisation of DNA has been correlated with cancer prognosis in analyses of the chromatin component of tumour cell nuclei using image texture analysis. As yet, the methodology has not been sufficiently validated to permit its clinical application. We aimed to define and validate a novel prognostic biomarker for the automatic detection of heterogeneous chromatin organisation.  Methods:   Machine learning algorithms analysed the chromatin organisation in 461 000 images of tumour cell nuclei stained for DNA from 390 patients (discovery cohort) treated for stage I or II colorectal cancer at the Aker University Hospital (Oslo, Norway). The resulting marker of chromatin heterogeneity, termed Nucleotyping, was subsequently independently validated in six patient cohorts: 442 patients with stage I or II colorectal cancer in the Gloucester Colorectal Cancer Study (UK); 391 patients with stage II colorectal cancer in the QUASAR 2 trial; 246 patients with stage I ovarian carcinoma; 354 patients with uterine sarcoma; 307 patients with prostate carcinoma; and 791 patients with endometrial carcinoma. The primary outcome was cancer-specific survival.  Findings:   In all patient cohorts, patients with chromatin heterogeneous tumours had worse cancer-specific survival than patients with chromatin homogeneous tumours (univariable analysis hazard ratio [HR] 1·7, 95% CI 1·2-2·5, in the discovery cohort; 1·8, 1·0-3·0, in the Gloucester validation cohort; 2·2, 1·1-4·5, in the QUASAR 2 validation cohort; 3·1, 1·9-5·0, in the ovarian carcinoma cohort; 2·5, 1·8-3·4, in the uterine sarcoma cohort; 2·3, 1·2-4·6, in the prostate carcinoma cohort; and 4·3, 2·8-6·8, in the endometrial carcinoma cohort). After adjusting for established prognostic patient characteristics in multivariable analyses, Nucleotyping was prognostic in all cohorts except for the prostate carcinoma cohort (HR 1·7, 95% CI 1·1-2·5, in the discovery cohort; 1·9, 1·1-3·2, in the Gloucester validation cohort; 2·6, 1·2-5·6, in the QUASAR 2 cohort; 1·8, 1·1-3·0, for ovarian carcinoma; 1·6, 1·0-2·4, for uterine sarcoma; 1·43, 0·68-2·99, for prostate carcinoma; and 1·9, 1·1-3·1, for endometrial carcinoma). Chromatin heterogeneity was a significant predictor of cancer-specific survival in microsatellite unstable (HR 2·9, 95% CI 1·0-8·4) and microsatellite stable (1·8, 1·2-2·7) stage II colorectal cancer, but microsatellite instability was not a significant predictor of outcome in chromatin homogeneous (1·3, 0·7-2·4) or chromatin heterogeneous (0·8, 0·3-2·0) stage II colorectal cancer.  Interpretation:   The consistent prognostic prediction of Nucleotyping in different biological and technical circumstances suggests that the marker of chromatin heterogeneity can be reliably assessed in routine clinical practice and could be used to objectively assist decision making in a range of clinical settings. An immediate application would be to identify high-risk patients with stage II colorectal cancer who might have greater absolute benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the survival benefit and cost-effectiveness of using Nucleotyping to guide treatment decisions in multiple clinical settings.

Methods:   We, retrospectively, evaluated patients with mCRPC in 7 Italian Institutes between March 2011 and October 2016. MS was defined by modified adult treatment panel-III criteria.

Results:   Eighty-three of 551 (15.1%) patients met MS criteria at baseline and 34 (6.2%) during treatment. MS patients (MS+) presented a greater INF profile compared to MS- (P<0.0001). Median PFS was 3.7 for MS+ vs. 8.7 months for MS- (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.77; 95% CI: 2.12-3.61; P<0.0001). Median OS was 6.9 and 19 months in MS+ and MS-, respectively (HR = 3.43; 95% CI: 2.56-4.58; P<0.0001). We also demonstrated INF led to shorter PFS and OS (4.5 vs. 8.5 months, HR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.15-1.90, P = 0.002, and 11.2 vs. 18.8 months, HR =1.66, 95% CI: 1.26-2.18, P = 0.0003, respectively). The combination of MS with INF provided the identification of high-risk prognostic group (MS+/INF+ vs. MS-/INF-) with worse PFS (3.7 vs. 9 months, HR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.88-3.89, P<0.0001) and OS (6.3 vs. 20.4 months, HR = 4.04, 95% CI: 2.75-5.93, P<0.0001). Multivariable analysis confirmed that MS was independently associated with PFS (HR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.03-4.18; P = 0.041) and OS (HR = 4.87; 95% CI: 2.36-10.03; P<0.0001).

It has been used as a chemopreventive agent and supplement. It may have some beneficial effects to treat prostate cancer by suppressing androgen production in Leydig cells. The objective of the present study was to study the effects of taxifolin on androgen production of rat Leydig cells isolated from immature testis and some rat and human testosterone biosynthetic enzyme activities. Rat Leydig cells were incubated with 100μM taxifolin without (basal) or with 10ng/ml luteinizing hormone (LH), 10mM 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8BR), and steroid enzyme substrates (20μM): 22R-hydroxychloesterol, pregnenolone, progesterone, and androstenedione. The medium concentrations of 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol (DIOL) and testosterone were measured. Taxifolin significantly suppressed basal, LH-stimulated, 8BR-stimulated, pregnenolone-mediated, and progesterone-mediated androgen production by Leydig cells. Further study demonstrated that taxifolin inhibited rat 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17α-hydroxylase/17, 20-lyase with IC50 values of 14.55±0.013 and 16.75±0.011μM, respectively. Taxifolin also inhibited these two enzyme activities in human testis with IC50 value of about 100μM. Taxifolin was a competitive inhibitor for these two enzymes when steroid substrates were used. In conclusion, taxifolin may have benefits for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Fei Ge', 'Erpo Tian', 'Li Wang', 'Xiaoheng Li', 'Qiqi Zhu', 'Yiyan Wang', 'Ying Zhong', 'Ren-Shan Ge']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Fitoterapia""","""['Suppression of rat and human androgen biosynthetic enzymes by apigenin: Possible use for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Effects of Etomidate on the Steroidogenesis of Rat Immature Leydig Cells.', 'Effects of dexmedetomidine on the steroidogenesis of rat immature Leydig cells.', 'Assessment of steroidogenesis and steroidogenic enzyme functions.', 'Steroid production in toads.', 'Protective Effects of a Polyphenolic Phytochemical Quercetin against Oxidative Dysfunctions in Rats.', 'Assessing the Mechanism of Action of ""Fructus Ligustri Lucidi-Cuscutae Semen"" in Prostate Cancer Treatment Using Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking.', 'Efficacy of Quercetin-Sensitized Cisplatin against N-Nitroso-NMethylurea Induced Testicular Carcinogenesis in Wistar Rats.', 'Improvement of Testicular Steroidogenesis Using Flavonoids and Isoflavonoids for Prevention of Late-Onset Male Hypogonadism.']"""

There are, as yet, no data concerning its use in whole-body primary staging and its interobserver variability in patients with prostate cancer (PC) prior to therapy.  Methods:   A search of our clinical database from April 2013 to May 2017 yielded 93 patients with histologically confirmed cancer in whom Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT had been performed for primary whole-body staging before therapy. Whole-body planar and SPECT/CT images of the lower abdomen and thorax had been obtained 3 to 4 hours postinjection of 706 ± 72 MBq Tc-MIP-1404. Images were visually analyzed for extent and location of abnormal uptake by 2 experienced nuclear physicians. Interobserver agreement for detection of primary tumor and metastatic lesions was assessed. In addition, SUVs of prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive regions of the prostate were determined in all patients, and from these, a variable reflecting total tumor load in the prostate gland was calculated (TUprostate). Follow-up reports of subsequent therapeutic interventions were available in 52 (56%) of all patients with a median follow-up of 18 months.  Results:   In 90 (97%) of 93 patients, prostate uptake above background was detected as correlate of the histologically diagnosed PC. Forty-eight lymph node and 29 bone metastases were detected in 16 and 9 patients, respectively. In addition, 3 patients had disseminated bone metastases. No distant organ metastases were found. Interobserver agreement was high for the overall scan result (97%), as well as for the detection of the primary tumor (97%), of lymph node metastases (97%), and of bone metastases (99%). Recurrence of PC occurred in 5 patients in whom follow-up was available (10%). TUprostate was significantly higher in patients with Gleason scores of 8 or greater compared with patients with Gleason scores of 7 or less and at prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum levels of 10 ng/mL or greater compared with PSA serum levels of 10 ng/mL or less. TUprostate of greater than 26 in the primary tumor predicted the occurrence of lymph node or bone metastases with a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 76%.  Conclusions:   MIP-1404 SPECT/CT has a high accuracy and low interobserver variability in the diagnosis of PC and allows detection of lymph node and bone metastases in a significant proportion of as yet untreated PC patients. TUprostate is correlated with Gleason score and PSA serum concentration and allows prediction of the occurrence of lymph node and bone metastases with moderate accuracy at primary staging.""","""['Christian Schmidkonz', 'Michael Cordes', 'Michael Beck', 'Theresa Ida Goetz', 'Daniela Schmidt', 'Olaf Prante', 'Tobias Bäuerle', 'Michael Uder', 'Bernd Wullich', 'Peter Goebell', 'Torsten Kuwert', 'Philipp Ritt']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['99m Tc-MIP-1404-SPECT/CT for the detection of PSMA-positive lesions in 225 patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'PSMA SPECT/CT with 99mTc-MIP-1404 in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: predictive factors and efficacy for the detection of PSMA-positive lesions at low and very-low PSA levels.', '99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT for Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Interobserver and Intraobserver Variability in Treatment-Related Longitudinal Tracer Uptake Assessments of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Positive Lesions.', 'PSMA PET and Radionuclide Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Current Status of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeting in Nuclear Medicine: Clinical Translation of Chelator Containing Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligands Into Diagnostics and Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'A Review on the Current State and Future Perspectives of 99mTcTc-Housed PSMA-i in Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiolabeled PSMA Inhibitors.', 'Molecular Imaging in Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer Patients: Current Aspects and Future Trends.', 'PSMA Theranostics: Science and Practice.', 'Comparing 99mTc-PSMA to 99mTc-MDP in Prostate Cancer Staging of the Skeletal System.']"""

The aim of this study was to design new PSMA ligands modified with an albumin-binding moiety in order to optimize their tissue distribution profile. The compounds were prepared by conjugation of a urea-based PSMA-binding entity, a DOTA chelator, and 4-( p-iodophenyl)butyric acid using multistep solid phase synthesis. The three ligands (PSMA-ALB-02, PSMA-ALB-05, and PSMA-ALB-07) were designed with varying linker entities. Radiolabeling with 177Lu was performed at a specific activity of up to 50 MBq/nmol resulting in radioligands of >98% radiochemical purity and high stability. In vitro investigations revealed high binding of all three PSMA radioligands to mouse (>64%) and human plasma proteins (>94%). Uptake and internalization into PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumor cells was equally high for all radioligands. Negligible accumulation was found in PSMA-negative PC-3 flu cells, indicating PSMA-specific binding of all radioligands. Biodistribution and imaging studies performed in PC-3 PIP/flu tumor-bearing mice showed enhanced blood circulation of the new radioligands when compared to the clinically employed 177Lu-PSMA-617. The PC-3 PIP tumor uptake of all three radioligands was very high (76.4 ± 2.5% IA/g, 79.4 ± 11.1% IA/g, and 84.6 ± 14.2% IA/g, respectively) at 24 h post injection (p.i.) resulting in tumor-to-blood ratios of ∼176, ∼48, and ∼107, respectively, whereas uptake into PC-3 flu tumors was negligible. Kidney uptake at 24 h p.i. was lowest for 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-02 (10.7 ± 0.92% IA/g), while 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-05 and 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-07 showed higher renal retention (23.9 ± 4.02% IA/g and 51.9 ± 6.34% IA/g, respectively). Tumor-to-background ratios calculated from values of the area under the curve (AUC) of time-dependent biodistribution data were in favor of 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-02 (tumor-to-blood, 46; tumor-to-kidney, 5.9) when compared to 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-05 (17 and 3.7, respectively) and 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-07 (39 and 2.1, respectively). The high accumulation of the radioligands in PC-3 PIP tumors was visualized on SPECT/CT images demonstrating increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Taking all of the characteristics into account, 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-02 emerged as the most promising candidate.

Previous studies have identified Twist as a key factor of acquired MDR in breast, gastric and prostate cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms of action of Twist in MDR remain unclear. In the present study, the expression levels of MDR-associated proteins, including lung resistance-related protein (LRP), topoisomerase IIα (TOPO IIα), MDR-associated protein (MRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and the expression of Twist in cancerous tissues and pericancerous tissues of human breast cancer, were examined. In order to simulate Taxol® resistance in cells, a Taxol®-resistant human mammary adenocarcinoma cell subline (MCF-7/Taxol®) was established by repeatedly exposing MCF-7 cells to high concentrations of Taxol® (up to 15 µg/ml). Twist was also overexpressed in 293 cells by transfecting this cell line with pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector containing full-length hTwist cDNA to explore the dynamic association between Twist and MDR gene-associated proteins. It was identified that the expression levels of Twist, TOPO IIα, MRP and P-gp were upregulated and LRP was downregulated in human breast cancer tissues, which was consistent with the expression of these proteins in the Taxol®-resistant MCF-7 cell model. Notably, the overexpression of Twist in 293 cells increased the resistance to Taxol®, Trichostatin A and 5-fluorouracil, and also upregulated the expression of MRP and P-gp. Taken together, these data demonstrated that Twist may promote drug resistance in cells and cancer tissues through regulating the expression of MDR gene-associated proteins, which may assist in understanding the mechanisms of action of Twist in drug resistance.""","""['Li Wang', 'Rui-Zhi Tan', 'Zhi-Xia Zhang', 'Rui Yin', 'Yong-Liang Zhang', 'Wei-Jia Cui', 'Tao He']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Establishment and characterization of adriamycin-resistant human colorectal adenocarcinoma HCT-15 cell lines with multidrug resistance.', 'Expression and significance of MRP, GST-pi, Topo IIalpha, and LRP in gastric carcinoma.', 'Effect of combination of taxol and celecoxib on reversing multidrug resistance human breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ Taxol) and explore its underlying mechanism.', 'Molecular mechanisms of multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy.', 'The prognostic significance of membrane transport-associated multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins in leukemia.', 'Association of the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) with Cisplatin Resistance.', 'The importance of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and autophagy in cancer drug resistance.', 'TWIST1 Gene Expression as a Biomarker for Predicting Primary Doxorubicin Resistance in Breast Cancer.', 'Effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors on ATP-binding cassette transporters in lung cancer A549 and colorectal cancer HCT116 cells.']"""

MicroRNA (miR)-1 was previously revealed to function as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer cells, and its expression was associated with reduced metastatic potential in lung cancer. The present study investigated the role of miR-1 and its association with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit α (PIK3CA) in the pathophysiology of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and analyzed the effects of miR-1 inhibitor or mimics on sensitivity to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the alterations of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in ESCC cells. Compared with normal tissues, the level of miR-1 expression was significantly lower and PIK3CA expression was higher in ESCC tissues. The level of miR-1 expression was also inversely associated with the level of PIK3CA mRNA expression. Low miR-1 and high PIK3CA expression levels were strongly associated with lymph node metastasis, and the level of miR-1 expression was negatively associated with clinical Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage. Furthermore, exogenous expression of miR-1 inhibited growth, arrested cell cycle in the G1 phase and increased apoptosis in ESCC cells, whereas it decreased PIK3CA protein expression levels. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-1 increased the sensitivity of ESCC cells to the anticancer drug, gefitinib. A possible mechanism for this increased sensitivity to gefitinib may be inactivation of the PIK3CA signaling pathway.

Methods and materials:   Fifty patients were accrued to an open-label Phase II clinical trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT01446991). Baseline prostate transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) was performed on all patients followed by degarelix administration and a repeat TRUS at Week 8.

Recently, the most significant advances in survival benefit from systemic therapy have come from moving the administration of therapy to an earlier disease state. There is movement toward using biomarkers from the intraprostatic index lesion to guide early systemic therapy.  Objective:   To determine the genomic heterogeneity, including the heterogeneity of predictive biomarkers, within the index focus of treatment-naïve prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Ten patients with treatment-naïve prostate cancer underwent prostatectomy. DNA was extracted from 70 spatially distinct regions of the 10 index foci.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Single nucleotide mutations, small indels, and copy number changes were identified. Intrafocal genomic heterogeneity and heterogeneity of alterations that predict response to therapy was determined.  Results and limitations:   Exome sequencing and copy number estimates demonstrate branched evolution with >75% of point mutations being subclonal, including numerous pathways associated with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Seven of 10 patients harbor alterations in one of five genes that predict response to targeted therapies with survival benefit in prostate cancer. Within biomarker-positive cases, 25% of intraprostatic regions are biomarker negative, with discordance between intraprostatic regions and lymph node metastases.  Conclusions:   Treatment-naïve, nonmetastatic prostate cancer has marked intrafocal heterogeneity. Numerous alterations in pathways associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer are present in subclonal populations, including biomarkers predictive of response to targeted therapy.

Objective:   To test the effect of PN versus radical nephrectomy (RN) on OCM, cancer-specific mortality (CSM), as well as 30-d mortality in patients with nonmetastatic T1a renal cell carcinoma (RCC), aged ≥75 yr old.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry (2004-2014), we identified surgically treated patients with nonmetastatic pT1a RCC aged ≥75 yr.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We relied on propensity score (PS) matching to reduce the effect of inherent differences between PN and RN. After PS matching, cumulative incidence, multivariable competing-risks regression (CRR) and logistic regression models were used. LOESS plots graphically depicted the relation between nephrectomy type and OCM after adjustment for all the covariates. Landmark analyses at 6 mo tested for immortal time bias.  Results and limitations:   Of all 4541 patients, 41.6% underwent PN. After 1:1 PS matching, 2826 patients remained. In multivariable CRR models, lower OCM rates were recorded in PN patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.67, confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.84; p<0.001). LOESS plots showed lower OCM rates after PN across all examined ages. Lower CSM rates were also recorded in PN patients (HR: 0.64, CI=0.44-0.92; p=0.02). Landmark analyses rejected the hypothesis of immortal time bias. Finally, PN did not result in different 30-d mortality rates (odds ratio: 1.87; CI: 0.79-4.47; p=0.2) versus RN. Data are retrospective.  Conclusions:   PN results in lower OCM in elderly patients with pT1a RCC. Moreover, PN does not contribute to higher CSM or 30-d mortality in patients aged ≥75 yr. In consequence, PN should be given strong consideration, even in elderly patients.  Patient summary:   Partial nephrectomy (PN) may protect from renal insufficiency, hypertension, and other unfavorable health outcomes, even in elderly patients.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of hormone replacement therapy on survival from colorectal cancer.  Patients and methods:   We performed a secondary analysis of data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, a large multicenter randomized trial run from 1993 to 2001, with follow-up data recently becoming mature. Participants were women aged 55 to 74 years, without recent colonoscopy. Data from the trial were analyzed to evaluate colorectal cancer incidence, disease-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality based on subjects' use of hormone replacement therapy at the time of randomization: never, current, or former users.  Results:   A total of 75,587 women with 912 (1.21%) incident colorectal cancers and 239 associated deaths were analyzed, with median follow-up of 11.9 years. Overall, 88.6% were non-Hispanic white, and < 10% had not completed high school. The never-user group was slightly older than the current or former user groups (average, 63.8 vs. 61.4 vs. 63.3 years; P < .001). Almost one-half (47.1%) of the current users had undergone hysterectomy, compared with 21.6% of never-users and 34.0% of former users (P < .001). Adjusted colorectal cancer incidence in current users compared to never-users was lower (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.94; P = .005), as was death from colorectal cancer (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.85; P = .002) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72-0.80; P < .001).

However, these results were not supported by the recently reported ARMOR3-SV phase III clinical trial, which employed an identical circulating tumour cell assay to assess AR-V7 expression. Therefore, the predictive utility of AR-V7 expression in mCRPC remains uncertain, as does any potential association between other AR-Vs and treatment response. To further investigate, we designed a highly sensitive and specific whole blood assay for detecting AR-V7 and AR-V9. We then examined for a correlation between baseline AR-V7/V9 status and treatment outcome in 37 mCRPC patients commencing abiraterone or enzalutamide. Of the patients, 24% (9/37) were AR-V-positive. Notably, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates did not significantly differ between AR-V-positive (6/9) and AR-V-negative (18/28) patients (66% vs 64%, p=0.9). Likewise, median PSA progression-free survival was not significantly different between AR-V-positive and AR-V-negative patients (9.2 mo vs not reached; p=0.9). These data, which support the findings of the pivotal ARMOR3-SV clinical trial, suggest that baseline AR-V expression does not predict outcomes in mCRPC patients receiving abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Patient summary:   Detection of androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) in circulating tumour cells of advanced prostate cancer patients has been linked to resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide.

For new techniques in radiotherapy (RT) such as image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), this is often not the case. We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare daily cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) IGRT with reduced planning target volume (PTV) margins vs weekly orthogonal portal imaging with conventional PTV margins. The primary aim of the study was to investigate the effect of two different image guidance techniques on patient reported outcome (PRO) using early side effects as proxy outcome of late rectal side effects in patients receiving curative RT for prostate cancer.  Methods:   This open label, phase 3 trial conducted at two RT centers in Norway enrolled men aged 18 years or older with previously untreated histologically proven intermediate or high-risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Patients eligible for radical RT received it after 3 months of total androgen blockage and were randomly assigned to 78 Gy in 39 fractions guided either by weekly offline orthogonal portal imaging (15 mm margins to PTV) or by daily online CBCT IGRT (7 mm margins to PTV). Based on previous results indicating that acute rectal side effects are a valid proxy outcome for late rectal side effects, the primary outcome was acute rectal toxicity at end of RT as evaluated by rectal bother scale (five of the items from PRO's QUFW94). The RIC-trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01550237.  Findings:   Between October 2012 and June 2015, 257 patients were randomly assigned to weekly offline portal imaging (n = 129) or daily online CBCT IGRT (n = 128). Out of 250 evaluable patients, 96% completed PROs at baseline and 97% at end of RT. Baseline analyses demonstrated balance between groups for baseline characteristics as well as for PROs. In general, patients reported a small degree of side effects at end of RT, and there was no difference between groups for primary outcome (rectal bother scale of QUFW94 1.871 vs 1.884, p = 0.804). In addition, there were no significant differences between groups for any other gastrointestinal or urinary symptom as reported by QUFW94. Health related quality of life analyses (EORTC QLQ 30) demonstrated no differences between groups.  Interpretation:   In radical RT for prostate cancer, daily CBCT IGRT with reduced PTV margins demonstrated no advantage with respect to patient reported side effects at end of RT as compared to weekly orthogonal offline portal imaging with standard PTV margins.""","""['Hanne Tøndel', 'Jo-Åsmund Lund', 'Stian Lydersen', 'Anne D Wanderås', 'Bjørg Aksnessæther', 'Christer Andre Jensen', 'Stein Kaasa', 'Arne Solberg']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Daily IGRT for prostate cancer: Can we stop the train?', 'Response to Alongi et al.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer with cone beam CT: dosimetric effects of imaging frequency and PTV margin.', 'The potential failure risk of the cone-beam computed tomography-based planning target volume margin definition for prostate image-guided radiotherapy based on a prospective single-institutional hybrid analysis.', 'PTV margin definition in hypofractionated IGRT of localized prostate cancer using cone beam CT and orthogonal image pairs with fiducial markers.', 'A systematic review of organ motion and image-guided strategies in external beam radiotherapy for cervical cancer.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'The role of image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT): a review of clinical outcomes-what is the clinical evidence for the most effective implementation?', 'Dosimetric Importance of the Implementation of Daily Image Guidance in Radiotherapy Practice.', 'Practical considerations for prostate hypofractionation in the developing world.', 'Efficacy and cost of high-frequency IGRT in elderly stage III non-small-cell lung cancer patients.']"""

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively identified 79 CRPC patients with distant metastasis at initial diagnosis from June 2002 to January 2014. All patients received initial androgen deprivation therapy and 46 received docetaxel chemotherapy after progressing to CRPC. The primary outcome of interest was cancer-specific survival (CSS) from the time of CRPC diagnosis. The Cox regression model was used to confirm whether IDC-P and docetaxel would act as independent factors for prognosis.  Results:   IDC-P was found in 62 of 79 patients. The median CSS in the IDC-P-present group was 18.2 versus 45.6 months in the IDC-P-absent group (HR 2.67; 95% CI 1.18 to 6.06; P = 0.019). Docetaxel was administered to 36 patients with IDC-P and 10 patients without IDC-P, with a median CSS of 20.5 versus 53.2 months, respectively (HR 2.98; 95% CI 1.02 to 8.64; P = 0.044). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of IDC-P and docetaxel were independent prognostic factors for CSS (P = 0.026 and 0.005, respectively) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.029 and 0.001, respectively).  Conclusion:   The presence of IDC-P is an independent prognostic factor in CRPC patients with distant metastases and IDC-P in needle biopsies at the time of initial diagnosis.

However, the optimal intensity and frequency of aerobic exercise training to improve these outcomes in colorectal cancer survivors is unknown.  Patients and methods:   This trial compared 8 weeks of moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE; 50 minutes; 70% peak heart rate [HRpeak]; 24 sessions), with high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE; 4 × 4 minutes; 85%-95% HRpeak) at an equivalent (HIIE; 24 sessions) and tapered frequency (HIIE-T; 16 sessions) on V˙o2peak and on lean and fat mass, measured at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks.  Results:   Increases in V˙o2peak were significantly greater after both 4 (+3.0 mL·kg-1·min-1, P = .008) and 8 (+2.3 mL·kg-1·min-1, P = .049) weeks of HIIE compared to MICE. After 8 weeks, there was a significantly greater reduction in fat mass after HIIE compared to MICE (-0.7 kg, P = .038). Four weeks after training, the HIIE group maintained elevated V˙o2peak (+3.3 mL·kg-1·min-1, P = .006) and reduced fat mass (-0.7 kg, P = .045) compared to the MICE group, with V˙o2peak in the HIIE-T also being superior to the MICE group (+2.8 mL·kg-1·min-1, P = .013).  Conclusion:   Compared to MICE, HIIE promotes superior improvements and short-term maintenance of V˙o2peak and fat mass improvements. HIIE training at a reduced frequency also promotes maintainable cardiorespiratory fitness improvements. In addition to promoting accelerated and superior benefits to the current aerobic exercise guidelines, HIIE promotes clinically relevant improvements even with a substantial reduction in exercise training and for a period after withdrawal.""","""['James L Devin', 'David G Jenkins', 'Andrew T Sax', 'Gareth I Hughes', 'Joanne F Aitken', 'Suzanne K Chambers', 'Jeffrey C Dunn', 'Kate A Bolam', 'Tina L Skinner']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Colorectal Cancer""","""['The influence of high-intensity compared with moderate-intensity exercise training on cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition in colorectal cancer survivors: a randomised controlled trial.', 'High-intensity interval training in the therapy and aftercare of cancer patients: a systematic review with meta-analysis.', 'The effect of acute aerobic exercise on central arterial stiffness, wave reflections, and hemodynamics in adults with diabetes: A randomized cross-over design.', 'High-intensity exercise interventions in cancer survivors: a systematic review exploring the impact on health outcomes.', 'Chronic Effect of Fatmax Training on Body Weight, Fat Mass, and Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Obese Subjects: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.', 'Effects of high-intensity interval exercise on cardiac troponin elevation when comparing with moderate-intensity continuous exercise: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'High-intensity aerobic interval training and resistance training are feasible in rectal cancer patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy: a feasibility randomized controlled study.', 'Exercise and colorectal cancer: prevention and molecular mechanisms.', 'Physical Activity in Stage III Colon Cancer: CALGB/SWOG 80702 (Alliance).', 'The effects of prehabilitation on body composition in patients undergoing multimodal therapy for esophageal cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   We assessed general and prostate cancer specific health related quality of life using the RAND SF-12v2™ (12-Item Short Form Survey, version 2) and the UCLA PCI (Prostate Cancer Index) at 3 time points in 24 men who transitioned to comprehensive insurance as the insured group relative to 39 who remained in the prostate cancer program as the control group. We used mixed effects models controlling for treatment and patient factors to measure health differences between the groups during the transition period.  Results:   Demographics, prostate cancer treatment patterns, and mental, physical and general health were similar before transition in the control and insured groups. After transition men who gained insurance coverage reported significantly worse physical health than men who remained in the prostate cancer program (p = 0.0038). After adjustment in the mixed effects model physical health remained worse in men who gained insurance (p = 0.0036). Mental health and prostate cancer related quality of life did not differ with time between the groups.  Conclusions:   Compared to controls who remained in the state funded prostate cancer treatment program for poor, uninsured men, newly insured men reported worse physical health after transitioning to ACA coverage. Providers and policy makers may draw important lessons from understanding the mechanisms of this paradoxical worsening in physical health after gaining insurance.

In contrast, the recently identified AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9® may function via degrading the AR protein to simultaneously suppress the PCa cell proliferation and invasion. The details of this unique mechanism, however, remain unclear. Here we found that ASC-J9® could suppress PCa cell invasion via inducing the sumoylation of STAT3, thereby inhibiting the STAT3 phosphorylation that led to suppress the EMT-SNAIL2 signals in both PCa DU145 and PC3 AR-negative cells. Mutation of lysine-679 on the sumoylation site of the STAT3 effectively blocked the ASC-J9®-suppressed PCa cell invasion in both in vitro cell lines and in vivo mouse models. These results suggest that in addition to degrading AR to suppress PCa cell proliferation, ASC-J9® can also function through an AR-independent mechanism via modulating the STAT3 sumoylation to alter the phospho-STAT3 status to suppress the PCa cell invasion. These dual functions of ASC-J9® to suppress PCa proliferation and invasion (via altering STAT3 sumoylation) may help us to develop a better anti-AR compound that may overcome the current antiandrogens' unwanted side-effect of increasing the metastasis to better suppress the castration-resistant PCa progression.""","""['WanYing Lin', 'Jie Luo', 'Yin Sun', 'ChangYi Lin', 'Gonghui Li', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['ASC-J9(®), and not Casodex or Enzalutamide, suppresses prostate cancer stem/progenitor cell invasion via altering the EZH2-STAT3 signals.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) degradation enhancer ASC-J9® in an FDA-approved formulated solution suppresses castration resistant prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Targeting fatty acid synthase with ASC-J9 suppresses proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'A review of the effects and molecular mechanisms of dimethylcurcumin (ASC-J9) on androgen receptor-related diseases.', 'Stromal androgen receptor roles in the development of normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', ""STAT3 and Its Pathways' Dysregulation-Underestimated Role in Urological Tumors."", 'AR Structural Variants and Prostate Cancer.', 'ASC-J9 Blocks Cell Proliferation and Extracellular Matrix Production of Keloid Fibroblasts through Inhibiting STAT3 Signaling.', 'Anti-Androgen Receptor Therapies in Prostate Cancer: A Brief Update and Perspective.', 'A Promising Anticancer Agent Dimethoxycurcumin: Aspects of Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy, Mechanism, and Nanoformulation for Drug Delivery.']"""

Objective:   To compare sexual rehabilitation outcomes in patients with low risk of erectile dysfunction and minimal comorbidities who received PDE5Is free of charge (PDE5I-F) with those who paid for PDE5Is (PDE5I-P) after bilateral NSRP.  Methods:   We reviewed prospectively recorded clinical data of 2,368 patients with Tuscan (PDE5I-F) and non-Tuscan (PDE5I-P) citizenship treated with NSRP at 3 different institutions in Tuscany from 2008 to 2013. Inclusion criteria for the final analysis were open or robot-assisted bilateral NSRP; low risk of postoperative erectile dysfunction according to the Briganti risk stratification tool; no smoking and no drug and alcohol abuse; no cardiovascular risk factors; no major surgery before and after NSRP; no neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment; and no biochemical relapse. Dropout was defined as an interruption longer than 40 days of the treatment protocol indicated in the inclusion criteria. Treatment compliance was defined as more than 90% consumption of the prescribed PDE5I.  Outcomes:   The Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) and the Italian version of the University of California-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index sexual function (UCLA-PCI-s) questionnaires were administered to assess patients' satisfaction with PDE5I treatment and sexual function.  Results:   Overall, 648 patients in the PDE5I-F group and 182 in the PDE5I-P group met the inclusion criteria and were eligible for the study. Patients had comparable preoperative and surgical characteristics. The PDE5I-F group had a significantly higher early rehabilitation onset (P < .001), lower treatment dropout at 12, 24, and 36 months (P < .001 for all comparisons), and higher compliance to the treatment protocol at 6 and 12 months (P = .01 and P < .001, respectively). At multivariable analysis, the PDE5I-F protocol was an independent predictor of an EDITS score higher than 50 (hazard ratio = 1.54, P = .03) and a UCLA-PCI-s score higher than 50 (hazard ratio = 3.12, P = .01) after adjusting for the effects of several clinical features.  Clinical implications:   The free-of-charge protocol has a significant impact on patients' satisfaction with PDE5I treatment.  Strengths and limitations:   To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing free vs paid access to a sexual rehabilitation protocol. Major limitations are the observational nature of the study and the different population sizes of the 2 groups.  Conclusions:   In a selected cohort of patients after NSRP, free-of-charge access to a sexual rehabilitation protocol was significantly associated with higher early rehabilitation onset, major compliance to the protocol, minor treatment dropout, and higher satisfaction rate of patients.

The purpose of this study was to assess the QOL among men with low-risk prostate cancer during the first year following diagnosis.

We assessed general depression, anxiety, and physical functioning, prostate-specific anxiety, and prostate-specific QOL at both interviews. Clinical variables were obtained from the medical record. Men were 61.7 (SD = 7.2) years old, 82% white, 39% had undergone AT (surgery or radiation), and 61.0% had begun AS. Linear regression analyses revealed that at follow-up, the AS group reported significantly better sexual, bowel, urinary, and general physical function (compared to AT), and no difference in depression. However, the AS group did report greater general anxiety and prostate-specific anxiety at follow-up, compared to AT. Among men with low-risk PCa, adjusting for pretreatment functioning, the AS group reported better prostate-related QOL, but were worse off on general and prostate-specific anxiety compared to men on AT.

Material and methods:   Microarray analysis were performed to compare the gene expression profiles of HCAs from mice exposed to low-dose-rate γ-rays with those of normal livers from non-irradiated mice. From the differentially expressed genes, those for possibly secretory proteins were selected. Then, the levels of the proteins in sera were analysed by ELISA.  Results:   Microarray analysis identified 4181 genes differentially expressed in HCAs (>2.0-fold). From these genes, those for α-fetoprotein (Afp), α-1B-glycoprotein (A1bg) and serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type-3 (Spink3) were selected as the genes for candidate proteins. ELISA revealed that the levels of Afp and A1bg proteins in sera significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in low-dose-rate irradiated mice with HCAs and also same tendency was observed in human patients with hepatocellular carcinomas.

Piperine (PIP) could enhance the bioavailability of other drugs via the inhibition of CYPs and P-gp activities. Thus, we hypothesize a positive effect with the DTX-PIP combination on the anti-tumor efficacy and intra-tumor DTX concentrations in taxane-resistant prostate cancer. ICR-NOD/SCID mice implanted with taxane-resistant human prostate cancer cells were administrated with saline as well as PIP and DTX separately or in combination. The tumor growth was monitored together with intra-tumor concentrations of DTX. The inhibitory effects on CYPs and P-gp were further assessed in mouse liver microsome and MDCK-MDR1 cells. Compared with DTX alone, DTX-PIP combination significantly inhibited the tumor growth (114% vs. 217%, p = 0.002) with corresponding significantly higher intra-tumor DTX concentrations (5.854 ± 5.510 ng/ml vs. 1.312 ± 0.754 ng/mg, p = 0.037). The percentage of DTX metabolism was significantly decreased from 28.94 ± 1.06% to 18.14 ± 2.22% in mouse liver microsome after administration of PIP for two weeks. DTX accumulation in MDCK-MDR1 cell was significantly enhanced in the presence of PIP. Further microarray analysis revealed that PIP inhibited P-gp as well as CYP1B1 gene expression and induced a significant gene expression change relating to inflammatory response, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, or cell migration. In conclusion, DTX-PIP combination significantly induces activity against taxane-resistant prostate tumor. Such effect appeared to be attributed to the inhibitory effect of PIP on CYPs and P-gp activity as well as gene expression changes relating to tumorigenesis and cellular responses.""","""['Chenrui Li', 'Zhijun Wang', 'Qian Wang', 'Rebecca Lucinda Ka Yan Ho', 'Ying Huang', 'Moses S S Chow', 'Christopher Wai Kei Lam', 'Zhong Zuo']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Overcoming chemoresistance in prostate cancer with Chinese medicine Tripterygium wilfordii via multiple mechanisms.', 'Targeted nanomedicine for prostate cancer therapy: docetaxel and curcumin co-encapsulated lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles for the enhanced anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo.', 'Roles of ligand and TPGS of micelles in regulating internalization, penetration and accumulation against sensitive or resistant tumor and therapy for multidrug resistant tumors.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', ""Piperine and Its Metabolite's Pharmacology in Neurodegenerative and Neurological Diseases."", 'Extraction, Characterization, and Evaluation of the Cytotoxic Activity of Piperine in Its Isolated form and in Combination with Chemotherapeutics against Gastric Cancer.', 'Chemosensitizing Effect and Efficacy of Wilforlide A in Combination With Docetaxel in Drug-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploring new Horizons in overcoming P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug-resistant breast cancer via nanoscale drug delivery platforms.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.', 'The role of AKR1 family in tamoxifen resistant invasive lobular breast cancer based on data mining.']"""

Moreover, we obtained a treatment schedule of hormone therapy by minimizing the PSA of 3 years later in the worst case scenario among the 100 parameter sets by searching exhaustively all over the possible treatment schedules.

Objective:   To determine whether incorporation of the novel urinary markers prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) and TMPRSS2:ERG (T2:ERG) into the PCPTRC improves its discrimination, accuracy, and clinical net benefit.  Design, setting, and participants:   Since PCA3 and T2:ERG were not measured as part of the PCPTRC, a Bayesian modeling approach was used to combine data where the markers were measured in a Michigan cohort with the PCPTRC as prior probabilities to form an updated PCPTRC. This update was compared to the existing PCPTRC on an independent Early Detection Research Network cohort in terms of discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis.  Results and limitations:   Among the 1225 Michigan biopsies, 57.7%, 24.0%, and 18.3% were negative, with low- and high-grade (Gleason grade≥7) prostate cancer, respectively. Evaluated on the Early Detection Research Network validation set comprising 854 biopsies, areas under the curve (95% confidence interval) for predicting high-grade cancer in the 854 biopsies comprising the validation set were 70.0% (66.0-74.0%), 76.4% (72.8-80.0%), and 77.1% (73.6-80.6%) for the PCPTRC alone, with PCA3 added, and PCA3 and T2:ERG added, respectively. Net benefit was improved for the updated PCPTRC, while calibration was not. Limitations are that the updated PCPTRC is based on two different cohorts, the PCPT and Michigan, and that 20% of the validation set came from the Michigan center. More validation is required; hence, the updated risk tool is posted online.  Conclusions:   Incorporation of PCA3 into the PCPTRC improved validation on an independent cohort, whereas T2:ERG offered negligible utility in addition to PCA3.  Patient summary:   After passing external validation, prostate cancer antigen 3 has been added to the online Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator for use by patients in deciding whether to proceed to biopsy.

The absorbed TBA is hydrolyzed to the active form, 17β-trenbolone (17 TB; 17β-hydroxy-estra-4,9,11-trien-3-one) in meat and milk products, which can cause adverse health effects in humans. Similar to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 17 TB was reported to exhibit endocrine disrupting effects on animals and humans due to its androgenic effect via binding to the androgen receptor. The purpose of this study is to investigate the molecular mechanism of cell proliferation in prostate cancer (PCa) cells treated with 17 TB. We found that 17 TB induces AR-dependent cell proliferation in the human prostate cancer cell line, 22Rv1 in a concentration dependent manner. Treatment with 17 TB increased the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, cyclin D2/CDK-4 and cyclin E/CDK-2, whereas the expression of p27 was down-regulated. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Rb and activation of E2F were also induced, which suggests the activation of cyclin D2/CDK-4 and cyclin E/CDK-2 in the cells.

Consistently, based on analyses of tissue microarray and microarray datasets, lower SIRT3 expression level was correlated with higher prostate cancer Gleason scores, and SIRT3 expression were significantly decreased in metastatic tissues compared with prostate tumor tissues. Mechanistically, SIRT3 promoted FOXO3A expression by attenuating Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby inhibiting EMT and migration of prostate cancer cells. Indeed, SIRT3's inhibitory effect on EMT and migration of prostate cancer cells can be rescued after applying Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator LiCl, or boosted by wnt inhibitor XAV939.

Altered expression of ECSOD and xCT can lead to imbalance of the TME redox state and likely have a profound effect on cancer invasion. In the present study, we investigated whether ECSOD and xCT could be therapeutic targets for prostate cancer (PCa) invasion.  Results:   Immunohistochemistry of tumor microarray PCa tissues (N = 165) with high Gleason scores indicated that xCT protein expression is significantly increased while ECSOD protein expression is significantly decreased. Metastatic PCa indicated ECSOD protein expression is significantly decreased in epithelial area whereas xCT protein expression is significantly increased in stromal area. Furthermore, inhibition of extracellular O2•- by overexpression of ECSOD or alteration of the extracellular Cys/CySS ratio by knockdown of xCT protein inhibited PCa cell invasion. Simultaneous overexpression of ECSOD and knockdown xCT inhibited PCa cell invasion more than overexpression of ECSOD or knockdown of xCT alone. In the co-culturing system, simultaneous overexpression of ECSOD and knockdown of xCT in prostate stromal WPMY-1 cells inhibited PCa cell invasiveness more than overexpression of ECSOD alone. The decrease in PCa invasion correlated with increased of extracellular H2O2 levels. Notably, overexpression of catalase in TME reversed the inhibitory effect of ECSOD on cancer cell invasion.  Conclusion:   Impaired ECSOD activity and an upregulated of xCT protein expression may be clinical features of an aggressive PCa, particularly metastatic cancers and/or those with a high Gleason score.

We evaluated the efficacy of apalutamide in men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were at high risk for the development of metastasis.  Methods:   We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial involving men with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of 10 months or less. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive apalutamide (240 mg per day) or placebo. All the patients continued to receive androgen-deprivation therapy. The primary end point was metastasis-free survival, which was defined as the time from randomization to the first detection of distant metastasis on imaging or death.  Results:   A total of 1207 men underwent randomization (806 to the apalutamide group and 401 to the placebo group). In the planned primary analysis, which was performed after 378 events had occurred, median metastasis-free survival was 40.5 months in the apalutamide group as compared with 16.2 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for metastasis or death, 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.35; P<0.001). Time to symptomatic progression was significantly longer with apalutamide than with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.63; P<0.001). The rate of adverse events leading to discontinuation of the trial regimen was 10.6% in the apalutamide group and 7.0% in the placebo group. The following adverse events occurred at a higher rate with apalutamide than with placebo: rash (23.8% vs. 5.5%), hypothyroidism (8.1% vs. 2.0%), and fracture (11.7% vs. 6.5%).

Similar to the three-electrode system, selective excitation of ECL could be achieved at the anode of the bipolar electrode (BPE). Both increase and decrease of the faradic reactions at the cathode of the BPE could induce ECL reporting color at the other pole switched from blue-green to red. We applied a closed BPE device for the bioanalysis of multicolor ECL since the organic solvent containing electrochemiluminophores could be separated from the bioanalytes. On the basis of BPE arrays coupled with the ECL switch, the detection of three biomarkers of prostate cancer, PSA, microRNA-141, and sarcosine were integrated in a same device. The cutoff values of the biomarkers could be recognized directly by the naked eye.

Thrombosis is a frequent complication of cisplatin chemotherapy. Furthermore, the optimal route of administration for chemotherapy is still under debate. The purpose of this study was to assess the patterns of care concerning dosing and duration of thromboprophylaxis currently utilized in TC patients in German-speaking countries as well as the route of chemotherapy administration.  Methods:   A standardized questionnaire was sent to all members of the German TC Study Group (GTCSG) and to all the urological university hospitals in Germany. The questionnaire was also sent to the oncologic clinics at those universities where urologists do not administer chemotherapy.  Results:   The response rate was 87% (55/63). Prophylactic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was administered in 94% of the clinics. The dosing of LMWH was prophylactic (85%), high prophylactic (adjusted to bodyweight) (7%), or risk adapted (9%). After completion of chemotherapy, anticoagulation was continued in 15 clinics (33%) for 2 to 24 weeks, while the remainder stopped the LMWH upon cessation of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was administered via central venous access in 59%, peripheral IV in 27%, or both in 14% of the clinics.  Conclusions:   Most of the institutions performed some form of thromboprophylaxis, although the modes of application varied by institution type and amongst the urologists and oncologists.

Local antimicrobial agents might help to reduce bacterial load. The aim of this study was to test the potency of antimicrobial lubricants to reduce local bacterial loads and specifically fluoroquinolone-resistant strains.  Patients and methods:   Overall, 384 prostate biopsy (PBx) patients of a larger prospective randomized trial (n = 1000) were included. Patients were randomized for biopsy with pre-interventional instillation of an antimicrobial lubricant (intervention group n = 256) or with the standard lubricant (control group n = 128). Bacteria were recovered on pre- and post-biopsy rectal swab cultures from both patient groups. Bacterial colonization was semi-quantitatively recorded and analyzed for the presence of ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates.  Results:   Within the intervention group, where antimicrobial lubricant was instilled for PBx, the post-biopsy bacterial count was statistically significantly lower compared to prior biopsy bacterial count (p < 0.001), while in the control group, no statistically significant difference was shown. Moreover, our results demonstrated the tendency for reduction in ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria growth when instillation of antimicrobial lubricant was used (9.4% versus 5.9%, p = 0.5 prior- and post-biopsy). No reduction in ciprofloxacin-resistant bacterial growth was demonstrated for the control group. Ciprofloxacin-resistance was shown in overall 30 (7.8%) patients.  Conclusion:   Our data demonstrated that the antimicrobial lubricant prior biopsy leads to reduced bacterial load. Moreover, our data show the tendency for reduced ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria growth when antimicrobial lubricant was instilled prior biopsy. However, the incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria is low in our patient population.

Patients and methods:   We included 1527 men diagnosed with PCa in 2000 and 2001 in the canton of Zurich. Multiple imputation methods were applied to missing data for stage, grade and comorbidities. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to explore the associations of comorbidities with treatment. Cox regression models were used to estimate all-cause mortality, and Fine and Gray competing risk regression models to estimate sub-distribution hazard ratios for the outcomes PCSM and OCM.  Results:   Increasing age was associated with a decreasing probability of receiving curative treatment, whereas an increasing Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) did not influence the treatment decision as strongly as age. The probability of OCM was higher for patients with comorbidities compared to those without comorbidities [CCI 1: hazard ratio 2.07 (95% confidence interval 1.51-2.85), CCI 2+: 2.34 (1.59-3.44)]; this was not observed for PCSM [CCI 1: 0.79 (0.50-1.23), CCI 2+: 0.97 (0.59-1.59)]. In addition, comorbidities had a greater impact on the patients' mortality than age.  Conclusions:   The results of the current study suggest that chronological age is a stronger predictor of treatment choices than comorbidities, although comorbidities have a larger influence on patients' mortality.

Methods:   We reviewed 614 patients, including 83 who underwent pTURP; those with incidental prostate cancer were excluded. Patients were divided into the TURP group and non-TURP group. Propensity score matching was performed for comorbidity, initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA), TNM stage, and Gleason score (GS). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to confirm castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Cox regression was performed to confirm factors affecting CSS.  Results:   Before matching, the TURP group had a worse TNM stage (p < 0.01) and GS (p = 0.028) and larger prostate volume (50.1 vs. 39.0 cc, p = 0.005) than the non-TURP group. The most common reason for pTURP was acute urinary retention. After matching, the TURP group showed worse outcomes in CRPC (p = 0.003), CSS (p = 0.003), and OS (p = 0.026). In multivariate analysis, factors for predicting CSS were a positive core percent [hazard ratio (HR) 1.015, p = 0.0272], GS (10 vs. ≤8; HR 6.716, p = 0.0008), and TURP within 3 months after biopsy (HR 2.543, p = 0.0482).

Conclusions:   The oncologic effect of pTURP as cytoreductive operation seems to be limited.

Here we show that treatment with anti-cholesterolemic drugs, statins, at doses achieved in patients, enhance the pro-tumorigenic activity of obesogenic diets. In addition, the use of a mouse model of prostate cancer and human prostate cancer xenografts revealed that in vivo simvastatin administration alone increases prostate cancer aggressiveness.

However, the role of Jazf1 in prostate cancer is still poorly understood. Hence, we investigated whether the expression of Jazf1 is associated with prostate cancer progression. We confirmed the upregulation of Jazf1 expression in human prostate tissue samples. In addition, using Jazf1 overexpressing prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and LNCaP, we found Jazf1 promoted cell proliferation and colony formation ability. We also observed that Jazf1 dramatically enhanced cell migration and invasion in transwell assays. Additionally, we checked the upregulation of vimentin and downregulation of E-cadherin expression in Jazf1-overexpressing DU145 and LNCaP cells. Moreover, we found that Slug, which is known to be regulated by JNK/c-Jun phosphorylation, was upregulated in the microarray analysis of two prostate cancer cell lines. Jazf1 promotes the phosphorylation of JNK/c-Jun, likely promoting cell proliferation and invasion through Slug. In a xenograft model, tumors overexpressing Jazf1 were larger than control tumors, and tumors with decreased Jazf1 were smaller.

ChIP analysis showed that miR-27a-5p expression is only regulated by c-Myc in the absence of aberrant promoter methylation. MiR-27a-5p knockdown in PC3 cells promoted cell growth, whereas miRNA forced expression in LNCaP and stable MYC-knockdown PC3 cells attenuated the malignant phenotype, suggesting a tumor suppressive role for miR-27a-5p. Furthermore, miR-27a-5p upregulation decreased EGFR/Akt1/mTOR signaling. We concluded that miR-27a-5p is positively regulated by MYC, and its silencing due to aberrant promoter methylation occurs early in prostate carcinogenesis, concomitantly with loss of MYC regulatory activity. Our results further suggest that along PCa progression, miR-27a-5p promoter becomes hypomethylated, allowing for MYC to resume its regulatory activity. However, the altered cellular context averts miR-27a-5p from successfully accomplishing its tumor suppressive function at this stage of disease.""","""['Daniela Barros-Silva', 'Pedro Costa-Pinheiro', 'Henrique Duarte', 'Elsa Joana Sousa', 'Adriane Feijó Evangelista', 'Inês Graça', 'Isa Carneiro', 'Ana Teresa Martins', 'Jorge Oliveira', 'André L Carvalho', 'Márcia M Marques', 'Rui Henrique', 'Carmen Jerónimo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['A regulatory circuit HP1γ/miR-451a/c-Myc promotes prostate cancer progression.', 'Identification of a novel microRNA-mRNA regulatory biomodule in human prostate cancer.', 'Activin A regulates microRNAs and gene expression in LNCaP cells.', 'microRNA as a systemic intervention in the specific breast cancer subtypes with C-MYC impacts; introducing subtype-based appraisal tool.', 'A Review on the Role of miR-149-5p in the Carcinogenesis.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', ""MicroRNA-27a-5p Inhibits Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion and Promotes Apoptosis of Wilms' Tumor Cell by Targeting PBOV1."", 'Association of Androgenic Regulation and MicroRNAs in Acinar Adenocarcinoma of Prostate.', 'LncRNA growth arrest specific transcript 5 inhibits the growth of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors via miR-27a-5p/cylindromatosis axis.', 'Identification of Signature Genes and Construction of an Artificial Neural Network Model of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Reconstructing smoking behaviors over the life course could reduce exposure assessment error.  Methods:   As part of a case-control study, we identified 402 incident and histologically confirmed PC cases that were matched by age (±5 years) to 805 population controls. Through direct interview, we obtained information about: age at smoking onset, intensity and frequency of cigarette smoking at different life stages, and smoking cessation age. Smoking status at interview and average smoking index over the lifetime (packs/year) were estimated. Life course smoking patterns were obtained applying the k-means+ method for longitudinal data to the smoking index (pack/year) for each life stage.  Results:   Two life-course smoking patterns were identified among ever smokers: ""pattern A"" characterized by males who reported low and constant smoking intensity (87.8%), and ""pattern B"" (12.2%) males with an initial period of low intensity, followed by an increase during the second period. Compared to never smokers, pattern B was associated with higher poorly differentiated PC, (OR 2.30; 95% CI 1.21-4.38). No association was observed with average smoking index.  Conclusion:   Life course smoking patterns seem to capture the smoking variability during life course and reduce the likelihood of reverse causation. Using this assessment strategy our findings support the potential role of tobacco smoking in PC, particularly poorly differentiated PC. Prospective studies with comprehensive smoking history during the lifetime are needed to confirm these findings.""","""['Evelyn Jiménez-Mendoza', 'Ruth A Vázquez-Salas', 'Tonatiuh Barrientos-Gutierrez', 'Luz Myriam Reynales-Shigematsu', 'Isaac Roberto Labra-Salgado', 'Hugo A Manzanilla-García', 'Luisa E Torres-Sánchez']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Dietary inflammatory index and prostate cancer risk in a case-control study in Mexico.', 'History of gonorrhea and prostate cancer in a population-based case-control study in Mexico.', 'Tobacco smoking patterns and differential food effects on prostate and breast cancers among smokers and nonsmokers in Córdoba, Argentina.', 'Relation of Vitamin E and Selenium Exposure to Prostate Cancer Risk by Smoking Status: A Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Consensus conference: smoking and prostate cancer.', 'Tobacco smoking is associated with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema and worse outcomes in interstitial lung disease.', 'The profile of Black South African men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the Free State, South Africa.', 'The Impact of Lifestyle on Prostate Cancer: A Road to the Discovery of New Biomarkers.', 'Contribution of MSMB promoter region gene polymorphism to early-onset prostate cancer risk in Mexican males.']"""

Mannitol is widely used to treat increased ICP. However, no studies to date have specifically evaluated the effect of mannitol on ICP in patients undergoing RALP. Ultrasonographic measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is considered a reliable technique to noninvasively evaluate the ICP. Therefore, this study compared ONSDs as a surrogate for ICP before and after mannitol administration in prostate cancer patients undergoing RALP.  Methods:   Mannitol (0.5 g/kg) was administered after pneumoperitoneum establishment and shifting to the Trendelenburg position. ONSDs were measured at six predetermined time points: 10 minutes after anesthesia induction (T0); 5 minutes after pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position before mannitol administration (T1); 30 minutes (T2), 60 minutes (T3), and 90 minutes (T4) after completion of mannitol administration during pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position; and at skin closure in the supine position (T5). Moreover, intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory variables were evaluated simultaneously.  Results:   Thirty-six patients were analyzed. ONSDs were significantly lower at T2, T3, and T4 than at T1 (all p < 0.001), with the greatest decrease observed at T4 compared with T1 (4.46 ± 0.2 mm vs 4.81 ± 0.3 mm, p < 0.001). Regional cerebral oxygen saturation, cardiac output, corrected flow time, peak velocity, body temperature, arterial CO2 partial pressure, peak airway pressure, plateau airway pressure, dynamic compliance, and static compliance were not significantly different during pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position; however, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were significantly different.  Conclusions:   Mannitol decreases the ONSD in patients undergoing RALP with CO2 pneumoperitoneum and the steep Trendelenburg position. This result provides useful information on the beneficial effects of mannitol administration on prostate cancer patients who may develop increased ICP during RALP.""","""['In-Jung Jun', 'Myong Kim', 'Joonho Lee', 'Se-Ung Park', 'Jai-Hyun Hwang', 'Jun Hyuk Hong', 'Young-Kug Kim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Editorial Comment on: Effect of Mannitol on Ultrasonographically Measured Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter as a Surrogate for Intracranial Pressure During Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy with Pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg Position by Jun et al.', 'Increase in intracranial pressure during carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum with steep trendelenburg positioning proven by ultrasonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter.', 'Dexmedetomidine attenuates the increase of ultrasonographic optic nerve sheath diameter as a surrogate for intracranial pressure in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: A randomized double-blind controlled trial.', 'Propofol attenuates the increase of sonographic optic nerve sheath diameter during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: a randomized clinical trial.', 'Intraoperative non invasive intracranial pressure monitoring during pneumoperitoneum: a case report and a review of the published cases and case report series.', 'Anesthetic concerns for robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Effect of dexmedetomidine on intracranial pressure in patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery in Trendelenburg position through ultrasonographic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter.', 'Optic Nerve Changes Detected with Ocular Ultrasonography during Different Surgical Procedures: A Narrative Review.', 'Comparison of the Effects of Propofol and Sevoflurane Anesthesia on Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter in Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Gynecology Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'The effect of laparoscopy on intracranial pressure as measured by optic nerve sheath diameter: A review.', 'Effects of Increased Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter on Inadequate Emergence from Anesthesia in Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy: A Prospective Observational Study.']"""

Methods:   T2-w and postcontrast T1-w MR images were acquired at 1.5 T before treatment (MRI1) and at 12 months of follow-up (MRI2) in 13 patients treated with radiotherapy for PCa. Right and left internal obturator muscle contours were manually delineated upon MRI1 and then automatically propagated on MRI2 by an elastic registration method. Planning CT images were coregistered to both MRIs and dose maps were deformed accordingly. A high-dose region receiving >55 Gy and a low-dose region receiving <55 Gy were identified in each muscle volume. Eighteen textural features were extracted from each region of interest and differences between MRI1 and MRI2 were evaluated.  Results:   A signal increase was highlighted in both T2-w and T1-w images in the portion of the obturators near the prostate, i.e., in the region receiving medium-high doses. A change in the spatial organization was identified, as an increase in homogeneity and a decrease in contrast and complexity, compatible with an inflammatory status. In particular, the region receiving medium-high doses presented more significant or, at least, stronger differences.

A combination of differential expression and focused in vitro and in vivo RNA interference screens revealed candidate drivers of metastasis that discriminated metastatic clones. Among these, asparagine synthetase expression in a patient's primary tumour was most strongly correlated with later metastatic relapse. Here we show that asparagine bioavailability strongly influences metastatic potential. Limiting asparagine by knockdown of asparagine synthetase, treatment with l-asparaginase, or dietary asparagine restriction reduces metastasis without affecting growth of the primary tumour, whereas increased dietary asparagine or enforced asparagine synthetase expression promotes metastatic progression. Altering asparagine availability in vitro strongly influences invasive potential, which is correlated with an effect on proteins that promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

Here, phage probes against t-PSA were selected from f8/8 landscape phage library. After three rounds of biopanning, four t-PSA-binding phage clones were isolated and identified by the DNA sequencing. Based on the phage capture assay, the phage clone displaying the fusion peptide ATRSANGM showed highest affinity and specificity against t-PSA. Subsequently, the t-PSA-specific phage was used as t-PSA capture probe in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) assay systems. Both assay methods showed high specificity and acceptable reliability for real serum samples analysis. By comparison, DPV method showed wider linear range (0.01-100 ng mL-1) and lower limit of detection (3 pg mL-1) than those (3.3-330 ng mL-1 and 1.6 ng mL-1) of ELISA. Moreover, DPV system showed smaller distinction to the authoritative method in real samples assay. Excitingly, the phage probe based DPV immunosensor showed high sensitivity for the detection of t-PSA and LOD achieved the pg mL-1 level, which was far lower than those values (usually above 0.1 ng mL-1) for reported immunosensors based on antibodies.

Methods:   From a cohort of 1000 men treated for PCa by radical prostatectomy, FA composition of PPAT was analysed in 156 patients (106 Caucasians and 50 African-Caribbeans), 78 with an indolent tumour (ISUP group 1 + pT2 + PSA <10 ng/mL) and 78 with an aggressive tumour (ISUP group 4-5 + pT3).

Purpose:   To assess the value of stretched-exponential and monoexponential diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for predicting the aggressiveness of PCa.  Study type:   Retrospective study.  Subjects:   Seventy-five patients with PCa.  Field strength:   3T DWI examinations were performed using b-values of 0, 500, 1000, and 2000 s/mm2 .  Assessment:   The research were based on entire-tumor histogram analysis and the reference standard was radical prostectomy.  Statistical tests:   The correlation analysis was programmed with Spearman's rank-order analysis between the histogram variables and Gleason grade group (GG). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) regression was used to analyze the ability of these histogram variables to differentiate low-grade (LG) from intermediate/high-grade (HG) PCa.  Results:   The percentiles and mean of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC) were correlated with GG (ρ: 0.414-0.593), while there was no significant relation among α value, skewnesses, and kurtosises with GG (ρ:0.034-0.323).

The synthesized PAA-MSNs were characterized by various techniques viz, SEM-EDS, TEM, BET, FT-IR and powder XRD. ETS was effectively loaded into the channels of PAA-MSN via electrostatic interactions. The cumulative release was much rapid at extracellular tumor (6.8) and endosomal pH (5.5) than that of blood pH (7.4). Hemolysis study was done for the prepared NPs. MTT assay results showed that the drug-loaded ETS-MCM-41-PAA NPs were more cytotoxic to both prostate cancer cells namely PC-3 and LNCaP than free ETS, which was attributed to their slow and sustained release behavior.

Genome-wide association studies have so far identified about 50 susceptibility loci associated with TGCT, including SPRY4. SPRY4 has shown tumour suppressor activity in several cancer cells, such as lung and prostate, while it was found to act as an oncogene in ovarian cancer. An intronic region within the SPRY4 gene produces a long non-coding RNA, SPRY4-IT1, which has been reported to act as an oncogene in melanoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, and as a tumour suppressor in lung cancer. The roles of SPRY4 and SPRY4-IT1 in TGCT development are yet unknown. We found higher expression levels of SPRY4, both mRNA and protein, and of SPRY4-IT1 in human TGCT than in normal adult testis. Small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated transient knockdown of SPRY4 and SPRY4-IT1 in two TGCT cell lines 833 K and NT2-D1 resulted in decreased cell growth, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of SPRY4 and SPRY4-IT1 also led to a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt.

Materials and methods:   Men who underwent prostate biopsy were identified in 5% Medicare RIFs (Research Identifiable Files) from October 2010 through September 2015. We evaluated the rate of prebiopsy prostate magnetic resonance imaging, defined as any pelvic MRI 6 months or less before biopsy with a prostate indication diagnosis code. Temporal changes were determined as well as variation by geography and among populations.  Results:   In male Medicare beneficiaries the prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging use rate increased from 0.1% in 2010 to 0.7% in 2011, to 1.2% in 2012, to 2.9% in 2013, to 4.7% in 2014 and to 10.3% in 2015. In 2015 the prebiopsy prostate magnetic resonance imaging rate varied significantly by patient age, including 5.7% for greater than 80 years vs 8.4% to 9.3% for other age ranges (p = 0.040) as well as by race, including 5.8% in African American vs 10.1% in Caucasian men (p = 0.009) and geographic region, including 6.3% in the Midwest to 12.5% in the Northeast (p <0.001). The rate was highest in Wyoming at 25.0%, New York at 23.7% and Minnesota at 20.5% but it was less than 1% in 10 states.  Conclusions:   Historical Medicare claims provide novel insights into the dramatically increasing adoption of magnetic resonance imaging prior to prostate biopsy. Following earlier minimal use the performance increased sharply beginning in 2013, exceeding 10% in 2015. However, substantial racial and geographic variation exists in adoption.

Here, we show that high level of AGR2 promotes the aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer (PCa) mouse models developed by either patient-derived xenografts or surgical intra-prostate implantation of PCa cells, associated with enrichment of the blood vessel network in tumor tissues. Angiogenesis markers VEGFR2 and CD34, accompanied with the invasive marker Vimentin, were predominantly stained in metastatic liver tissues. Secreted AGR2 was defined to enhance VEGFR2 activity as evidenced by physical interaction of purified recombinant human AGR2 (rhAGR2) with rhVEGFA through the formation of a disulfide bond.

Materials and methods:   In this prospective observational study we analyzed 68Ga labeled prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computerized tomography in a select group of patients with persistently elevated prostate specific antigen and/or Prostate Health Index suspicious for prostate cancer, negative digital rectal examination and at least 1 negative biopsy. The cohort comprised men with equivocal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System, version 2 score of 2 or less), or an absolute or relative contraindication to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Sensitivity, specificity and CIs were calculated compared to histopathology findings. ROC analysis was applied to determine the optimal cutoff values of 68Ga labeled prostate specific membrane antigen uptake to identify clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason score 7 or greater).  Results:   A total of 45 patients with a median age of 64 years were referred for 68Ga labeled prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computerized tomography between January and August 2017. The 25 patients (55.5%) considered to have positive positron emission tomography results underwent software assisted fusion biopsy. We determined the uptake values of regions of interest, including a median maximum standardized uptake value of 5.34 (range 2.25 to 30.41) and a maximum-to-background standardized uptake value ratio of 1.99 (range 1.06 to 14.42). Mean and median uptake values on 68Ga labeled prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (ie the maximum standardized uptake value or the maximum-to-background standardized uptake value ratio) were significantly higher for Gleason score 7 lesions than for Gleason score 6 or benign lesions (p <0.001). On ROC analysis a maximum standardized uptake value of 5.4 and a maximum-to-background standardized uptake value ratio of 2 discriminated clinically relevant prostate cancer with 100% overall sensitivity in each case, and 76% and 88% specificity, respectively.

Our data showed that VK2 significantly inhibited CRPC VCaP cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner at 48 h treatment in vitro. In addition, VK2 reduced the migration potential of VCaP cells and inhibited anchorage-independent growth of these cells. Our results also showed that VK2 induces apoptosis in VCaP cells. Furthermore, VK2 enforced growth arrest in VCaP cells by activating cellular senescence. Notably, VK2 treatment elevated the levels of reactive oxygen species in VCaP cells. Western blot analysis revealed that VK2 downregulated the expression of androgen receptor, BiP, survivin, while activating caspase-3 and -7, PARP-1 cleavage, p21 and DNA damage response marker, phospho-H2AX in VCaP cells.

However, its metabolites, sulforaphane-cysteine (SFN-Cys) and sulforaphane-N-acetyl-cysteine (SFN-NAC) had longer half-lives and decreased the cell viability in both dose- and time-dependent manners in human prostate cancer. Flow cytometry assay revealed that these two SFN metabolites induced apoptosis with the features such as vacuolization, disappeared nuclear envelope, nuclear agglutination and fragmentation via transmission electron microscopy observation. Western blot showed that the sustained phosphorylation of ERK1/2 mediated by SFN metabolites caused activation and upregulation of cleaved Caspase 3 and downregulation of α-tubulin. High expression of α-tubulin was demonstrated to be positively correlated with cancer pathological grading. Both co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining implicated the interaction between SFN metabolite-induced phosphorylated ERK1/2 and α-tubulin, and Caspase 3 cleavage assay showed that α-tubulin might be the substrate for cleaved Caspase 3. More, the SFN metabolite-mediated reduction of α-tubulin increased the depolymerization and instability of microtubules by microtubule polymerization assay. Reversely, microtubule-associated protein Stathmin-1 phosphorylation was increased via phosphorylated ERK1/2 and total Stathmin-1 was reduced, which might promote over-stability of microtubules. Immunofluorescence staining also showed that SFN metabolites induced the 'nest-like' structures of microtubule distribution resulting from the disrupted and aggregated microtubules, and abnormal nuclear division, suggesting that the disturbance of spindle formation and mitosis turned up. Thus, SFN-Cys and SFN-NAC triggered the dynamic imbalance of microtubules, microtubule disruption leading to cell apoptosis.

Given the central role of androgen receptor (AR) signaling in prostate cancer, we hypothesized that AR could promote prostate cancer cell growth in part through increasing glucose uptake via the expression of distinct glucose transporters. Here, we determined that AR directly increased the expression of SLC2A12, the gene that encodes the glucose transporter GLUT12. In support of these findings, gene signatures of AR activity correlated with SLC2A12 expression in multiple clinical cohorts. Functionally, GLUT12 was required for maximal androgen-mediated glucose uptake and cell growth in LNCaP and VCaP cells. Knockdown of GLUT12 also decreased the growth of C4-2, 22Rv1 and AR-negative PC-3 cells. This latter observation corresponded with a significant reduction in glucose uptake, indicating that additional signaling mechanisms could augment GLUT12 function in an AR-independent manner. Interestingly, GLUT12 trafficking to the plasma membrane was modulated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2)-5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, a pathway we previously demonstrated to be a downstream effector of AR.

Objective:   To investigate the prognostic value of circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration and dynamics, in the context of second-line endocrine therapies (ie, abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide), irrespective of prior systemic therapies.  Design, settings, and participants:   In a prospective, multicentre study blood samples for CTC enumeration were collected from patients with mCRPC at baseline (n = 174). In patients who responded for minimally 10-12 weeks a follow-up sample was collected.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   For baseline analysis, patients were stratified in <5 or ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL, whereas for the analysis of CTC dynamics at 10-12 weeks, in patients with stable, increasing or decreasing CTC counts. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and PSA changes at 10-12 weeks were compared between groups.  Results:   Patients demonstrating increasing CTCs on therapy had a shorter median PFS (4.03 vs 12.98 vs 13.67 months, HR 3.6, 95%CI 1.9-6.8; P < 0.0001) and OS (11.2 months vs not reached, HR 9.5, 95%CI 3.7-24; P < 0.0001), compared to patients with decreasing or stable CTCs. Multivariable Cox regression showed that prior chemotherapy (HR 4.1, 95%CI 1.9-8.9; P = 0.0003), a high baseline CTC count (HR 1.5, 95%CI 1.2-1.9; P = 0.002) and increasing CTCs at follow-up (HR 3.3, 95%CI 1.4-7.6; P = 0.005) were independent predictors of worse PFS.

The relationship between retrospective and prospective appraisals of illness on quality of life in prostate cancer survivors""","""Objective:   Despite a generally good prognosis, many prostate cancer survivors have poor quality of life (QOL). A greater understanding of how psychological appraisals influence QOL is merited given their potentially modifiable nature. In this study, we considered how elements of survivors' retrospective and prospective appraisals relate to QOL.  Methods:   A total of 1229 prostate cancer survivors between 2 and 5 years post-diagnosis, identified from a population-based National Cancer Registry, were asked questions on their socio-demographics, health, treatment received, and adverse-effects using a cross-sectional design. QOL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30. Retrospective appraisals were assessed by asking survivors to reflect on their experience of treatment-related adverse-effects compared with their prior expectations. A fear of recurrence scale assessed prospective appraisals of future disease course. A multiple regression model explored the impact of psychological appraisals on QOL, after controlling for socio-demographic, treatment, and health-related factors.  Results:   The model was significant explaining 37% of variance in QOL. The strongest associate with QOL was fear of recurrence (β = -.29; P < .001). Survivors who experienced side effects that were worse than expected had significantly lower QOL (β = -.10; P = .002). Other significant correlates of lower QOL were presence of comorbidities, having undergone a less invasive treatment, and having more advanced disease. Working at diagnosis and having a higher level of education were significantly associated with higher QOL.  Conclusions:   Results suggest both retrospective and prospective appraisals are independently related to QOL in prostate cancer. Providing survivors with more information about possible adverse effects of treatment, as well as providing appropriate information regarding future disease progression, may improve QOL.""","""['Rebecca Maguire', 'Paul Hanly', 'Frances J Drummond', 'Anna Gavin', 'Linda Sharp']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Regret and fear in prostate cancer: The relationship between treatment appraisals and fear of recurrence in prostate cancer survivors.', 'A correlation study of fear of cancer recurrence, illness representation, self-regulation, and quality of life among gynecologic cancer survivors in Taiwan.', 'Appraisals, perceived dyadic communication, and quality of life over time among couples coping with prostate cancer.', 'Psychological variables associated with quality of life following primary treatment for head and neck cancer: a systematic review of the literature from 2004 to 2015.', 'Quality of Life Among Black Prostate Cancer Survivors: An Integrative Review.', 'The impact of chemotherapy-induced inner ear damage on quality of life in cancer survivors: a qualitative study.', 'Factors Associated With Fear of Cancer Recurrence in Family Caregivers of Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review.', 'Cognitive function, depression, and anxiety in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with and without adjuvant treatment.', 'Longitudinal dyadic associations of fear of cancer recurrence and the impact of treatment in prostate cancer patients and their spouses.', 'Beyond care burden: associations between positive psychological appraisals and well-being among informal caregivers in Europe.']"""

Liminality can make it difficult for cancer patients to narrate their experiences, as their stories lack a definite ending. After interviews with 22 Finnish men who had undergone radical prostatectomy, we analysed how men produce closure in their illness narratives. Focusing on the timelines of control visits or their anticipated recovery from side effects, these interviewees sought provisional certainty within a seemingly chaotic future. By locating erectile dysfunction in the wider context of a life-course and interpreting their fading sexuality as a 'natural' consequence of ageing, these men were adjusting to their post-operative lives.

Canonical Hh is a Smoothened- (Smo-) driven process that alters the post-translational processing of Gli2/Gli3 proteins. Though evidence supports a role for Gli action in prostate cancer (PCa) cell growth and progression, there is little indication that Smo is involved. Here we describe a non-canonical means for activation of Gli transcription in PCa cells mediated by the binding of transcriptionally-active androgen receptors (ARs) to Gli3. Androgens stimulated reporter expression from a Gli-dependent promoter in a variety of AR + PCa cells and this activity was suppressed by an anti-androgen, Enz, or by AR knockdown. Androgens also upregulated expression of endogenous Gli-dependent genes. This activity was associated with increased intranuclear binding of Gli3 to AR that was antagonized by Enz. Fine mapping of the AR binding domain on Gli2 showed that AR recognizes the Gli protein processing domain (PPD) in the C-terminus. Mutations in the arginine-/serine repeat elements of the Gli2 PPD involved in phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation blocked the binding to AR. β-TrCP, a ubiquitin ligase that recognizes the Gli PPD, competed with AR for binding to this site. AR binding to Gli3 suppressed its proteolytic processing to the Gli3 repressor form (Gli3R) whereas AR knockdown increased Gli3R. Both full-length and truncated ARs were able to activate Gli transcription. Finally, we found that an ARbinding decoy polypeptide derived from the Gli2 C-terminus can compete with Gli3 for binding to AR. Exogenous overexpression of this decoy suppressed Gli transcriptional activity in PCa cells. Collectively, this work identifies a novel pathway for non-canonical activation of Hh signaling in PCa cells and identifies a means for interference that may have clinical relevance for PCa patients.""","""['Na Li', 'Sarah Truong', 'Mannan Nouri', 'Jackson Moore', 'Nader Al Nakouzi', 'Amy Anne Lubik', 'Ralph Buttyan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Determinants of Gli2 co-activation of wildtype and naturally truncated androgen receptors.', 'Hedgehog/Gli supports androgen signaling in androgen deprived and androgen independent prostate cancer cells.', 'The GLI genes as the molecular switch in disrupting Hedgehog signaling in colon cancer.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Proteostasis in the Hedgehog signaling pathway.', 'Genetic alterations in MED12 promote castration-resistant prostate cancer through modulation of GLI3 signaling.', 'Malignant DFFB isoform switching promotes leukemia survival in relapse pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.', 'Gender-related differentially expressed genes in pancreatic cancer: possible culprits or accomplices?', 'Fatty Acid Signaling Impacts Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity in an Autocrine and Paracrine Manner.', 'Signaling Pathways and Targeted Therapies for Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, the mechanism by which ZFX influences transcriptional regulation has not been determined. We performed ChIP-seq in four cancer cell lines (representing kidney, colon, prostate, and breast cancers) to identify ZFX binding sites throughout the human genome. We identified ~9,000 ZFX binding sites and found that the majority of the sites are in CpG island promoters. Moreover, genes with promoters bound by ZFX are expressed at higher levels than genes with promoters not bound by ZFX. To determine if ZFX contributes to regulation of the promoters to which it is bound, we performed RNA-seq analysis after knockdown of ZFX by siRNA in prostate and breast cancer cells. Many genes with promoters bound by ZFX were downregulated upon ZFX knockdown, supporting the hypothesis that ZFX acts as a transcriptional activator. Surprisingly, ZFX binds at +240 bp downstream of the TSS of the responsive promoters. Using Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome Sequencing (NOMe-seq), we show that ZFX binds between the open chromatin region at the TSS and the first downstream nucleosome, suggesting that ZFX may play a critical role in promoter architecture. We have also shown that a closely related zinc finger protein ZNF711 has a similar binding pattern at CpG island promoters, but ZNF711 may play a subordinate role to ZFX.

A total of 205 patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (≥ 4 ng/ml) or clinical suspicion of PCa who underwent primary transperineal prostate biopsy were included in this cross-sectional study. The assessment of PIA, HGPIN, and PCa were performed by 2 experienced pathologists and samples were investigated for the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate, according to the Irani score. Primary and secondary Gleason grade of tumor in positive biopsies were evaluated according to the 2016 ISUP Modified Gleason System.  Results:   In the entire cohort, median age was 68.0 (interquartile range: 62.0-74.5), median prostate-specific antigen was 6.5 (interquartile range: 5.51-9.57).

Estimated 5-year metastases-free survival rate was 99% for patients with a first postoperative PSA<0.2ng/ml and 87% for ≥0.2ng/ml.  Conclusions:   pN1 patients with a first postoperative PSA ≥0.2ng/ml were more likely to develop metastases. First postoperative PSA may be useful in identifying pN1 patients who harbor distant disease and aid in secondary treatment decisions.""","""['Michelle L McDonald', 'Lauren E Howard', 'William J Aronson', 'Martha K Terris', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Christopher L Amling', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Christopher J Kane']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Single Positive Lymph Node Prostate Cancer Can Be Treated Surgically without Recurrence.', 'Outcomes after radical prostatectomy for patients with clinical stages T1-T2 prostate cancer with pathologically positive lymph nodes in the prostate-specific antigen era.', 'Immunohistologic detection of prostate cancer pelvic lymph node micrometastases: correlation to preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen.', 'Racial disparity in clinical course and outcome of metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Clinicopathological and oncological significance of persistent prostate-specific antigen after radical prostatectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Clinical outcomes of salvage treatment in lymph node-positive prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'Significance of Time Until PSA Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy Without Neo- or Adjuvant Treatment to Clinical Progression and Cancer-Related Death in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Their prognostic and predictive impact relating to standard therapies is unclear.  Objective:   To determine whether gDDRm status impacts benefit from established therapies in mPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a retrospective, international, observational study. Medical records were reviewed for 390 mPC patients with known gDDRm status. All 372 patients from Royal Marsden (UK), Weill-Cornell (NY), and University of Washington (WA) were previously included in a prevalence study (Pritchard, NEJM 2016); the remaining 18 were gBRCA1/2m carriers, from the kConFab consortium, Australia.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) data were collected. To account for potential differences between cohorts, a mixed-effect model (Weibull distribution) with random intercept per cohort was used.  Results and limitations:   The gDDRm status was known for all 390 patients (60 carriers of gDDRm [gDDRm+], including 37 gBRCA2m, and 330 cases not found to carry gDDRm [gDDRm-]); 74% and 69% were treated with docetaxel and abiraterone/enzalutamide, respectively, and 36% received PARP inhibitors (PARPi) and/or platinum. Median OS from castration resistance was similar among groups (3.2 vs 3.0 yr, p=0.73). Median docetaxel PFS for gDDRm+ (6.8 mo) was not significantly different from that for gDDRm- (5.1 mo), and RRs were similar (gDDRm+=61%; gDDRm-=54%). There were no significant differences in median PFS and RR on first-line abiraterone/enzalutamide (gDDRm+=8.3 mo, gDDRm-=8.3 mo; gDDRm+=46%, gDDRm-=56%). Interaction test for PARPi/platinum and gDDRm+ resulted in an OS adjusted hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% confidence interval 0.28-1.25; p=0.17). Results are limited by the retrospective nature of the analysis.  Conclusions:   mPC patients with gDDRm appeared to benefit from standard therapies similarly to the overall population; prospective studies are ongoing to investigate the impact of PARPi/platinum.

The aim herein was to evaluate the Nintedanib therapeutic effects on morphology and COX-2 and IL-17 levels in the prostate anterior lobe in different grades of the tumor progression in TRAMP mice. Animals were treated with Nintedanib at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day in initial and intermediate grades of tumor development. At the end of treatment, the prostate anterior lobe was collected and submitted to morphological, immunohistochemical and Western Blotting analyses. The results showed that Nintedanib delayed the prostate carcinogenesis progression, with over 20% of reduction in frequency of tissue injuries, particularly in the group treated from 12 to 16 weeks of age. Also, decreased COX-2 and IL-17 levels were observed in both groups treated with Nintedanib in the prostate anterior lobe. Thus, we concluded that Nintedanib was effective in delaying tumor progression and, despite not directly acting on inflammation, Nintedanib may adversely affect inflammatory pathways, favoring prostate cancer delay.""","""['Letícia Ferreira Alves', 'Raquel Frenedoso da Silva', 'Valéria Helena Alves Cagnon']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Tissue Cell""","""['Nintedanib antiangiogenic inhibitor effectiveness in delaying adenocarcinoma progression in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP).', 'Nintedanib treatment delays prostate dorsolateral lobe cancer progression in the TRAMP model: contribution to the epithelial-stromal interaction balance.', 'Association of anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic therapies negatively influences prostate cancer progression in TRAMP mice.', 'Antiangiogenic therapy with Nintedanib affects hypoxia, angiogenesis and apoptosis in the ventral prostate of TRAMP animals.', 'Anti-inflammatory therapies in TRAMP mice: delay in PCa progression.', 'Lobe-specific responses of TRAMP mice dorsolateral prostate following celecoxib and nintedanib therapy.', 'Fluorine-Modified Rutaecarpine Exerts Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibition and Anti-inflammatory Effects in Lungs.']"""

Conventional treatments are often accompanied by adverse side effects. By contrast, consumers of phytochemicals-based dietary supplements often report a reduction in symptoms without side effects. The field needs studies that quantify the strength and character of perceived benefits.  Objectives:   The study intended to quantify the character and strength of perceived improvements in LUTS in men, after the consumption of a prostate health supplement.  Design:   The research team sent questionnaires to 200 potential participants, requesting their self-reported retrospective assessments of their LUTS for the month prior to starting their use of a prostate health supplement, ProstaCaid (ie, at baseline from memory), and their assessments at the time of the study (ie, postintervention) based on their current symptoms.  Setting:   The study was conducted from consumers of ProstaCaid at their home through a mailed questionnaire from Econugenics (Santa Rosa, CA, USA).  Participants:   Participants were 65 male patients, ages 56 to 86 y, including those diagnosed with BPH, prostate cancer, or multiple diagnoses, or who had no formal diagnosis.  Interventions:   Participants had taken at least 2 capsules/d of the supplement for a minimum of 2 mo.  Outcome measures:   Participants were asked to recall and rate urinary tract symptoms: (1) incomplete emptying (ie, sensation of not emptying the bladder), (2) urinary frequency, (3) intermittency, (4) urgency, (5) weak stream, (6) straining, and (7) nocturia, (ie, how many times the participant typically gets up at night to urinate). A questionnaire based on the international prostate symptom score questionnaire was used. Logistic regressions, based on the proportional odds ratios of LUTS scores, were used for statistical analysis.  Results:   The participants reported substantial improvements in a range of individual and composite LUTS scores. In addition, the variability of current scores was substantially reduced compared with recalled, past scores, indicating that the perceived improvements were shared among the respondents. Statistical analysis identified urgency and weak stream as the symptoms showing the greatest reduction in perceived severity, which therefore could be used as the subject of future case-controlled studies.  Conclusions:   When properly interpreted, retrospective, self-reported data can yield insights into the perceived benefits of supplements and help guide the care of patients who augment traditional treatment with alternative medicines. Reported improvements can also guide the development of testable hypotheses for randomized, case-controlled studies.""","""['Isaac Eliaz', 'Elaine Weil', 'Barry Wilk']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Altern Ther Health Med""","""['Assessment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men by international prostate symptom score and core lower urinary tract symptom score.', 'Extended-release tolterodine with or without tamsulosin in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and overactive bladder: effects on urinary symptoms assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score.', 'Tadalafil - a therapeutic option in the management of BPH-LUTS.', 'Patient-reported outcomes in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treated with intraprostatic OnabotulinumtoxinA: 3-month results of a prospective single-armed cohort study.', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia and urinary symptoms: Evaluation and treatment.', 'Self-Assessed Benefits of a Prostate Health Formulation on Nocturia in Healthy Males With Mild Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: An Open Label Study.', 'Serenoa repens and Urtica dioica Fixed Combination: In-Vitro Validation of a Therapy for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).']"""

The purpose of this study was to clinically implement and investigate real-time IGART using a standard linear accelerator.  Materials/methods:   We developed and implemented two real-time technologies for standard linear accelerators: (1) Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring (KIM) that finds the target and (2) multileaf collimator (MLC) tracking that aligns the radiation beam to the target. Eight prostate SABR patients were treated with this real-time IGART technology. The feasibility, geometric accuracy and the dosimetric fidelity were measured.  Results:   Thirty-nine out of forty fractions with real-time IGART were successful (95% confidence interval 87-100%). The geometric accuracy of the KIM system was -0.1 ± 0.4, 0.2 ± 0.2 and -0.1 ± 0.6 mm in the LR, SI and AP directions, respectively. The dose reconstruction showed that real-time IGART more closely reproduced the planned dose than that without IGART. For the largest motion fraction, with real-time IGART 100% of the CTV received the prescribed dose; without real-time IGART only 95% of the CTV would have received the prescribed dose.

We characterized androgen receptor-mediated tissue factor regulation in prostate epithelial cells. Androgen receptor is dampening tissue factor expression in prostate epithelial cells. Androgen deprivation could enhance tissue factor expression and raise venous thromboembolism rates.  Summary:   Background Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in men. Advanced prostate cancer is usually treated by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which is aimed at reducing circulating testosterone levels to reduce cancer growth. There is growing evidence that ADT can increase the rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in prostate cancer patients. The tissue factor (TF) gene is one of the most important mediators of coagulation and VTE, but, so far, there are limited data on androgen receptor (AR)-mediated TF gene expression. Objectives To characterize AR-mediated TF regulation in vitro and in vivo. Methods We used the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and MyC-CaP to test whether TF expression is regulated by AR. Furthermore, we cloned the TF gene promoter into a luciferase reporter vector to identify the transcription factor-binding sites that mediate TF regulation downstream of AR. Finally, we used castration experiments in mice to characterize AR-mediated TF regulation in vivo. Results TF is directly regulated by AR. In LNCaP cells, nuclear factor-κB signaling and EGR1 mediate TF expression. By using castration experiments in mice, we could detect upregulation of TF and early growth response protein 1 mRNA and protein expression in prostate epithelial cells. Conclusion AR is crucial for dampening TF expression, which could be important for increased TF expression and TF-positive microvesicle release in androgen-deprived prostate cancer patients.""","""['B Hoesel', 'M Mussbacher', 'B Dikorman', 'M Salzmann', 'A Assinger', 'L Hell', 'J Thaler', 'J Basílio', 'B Moser', 'U Resch', 'H Paar', 'N Mackman', 'J A Schmid']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Thromb Haemost""","""['Identification of a negative regulatory cis-element in the enhancer core region of the prostate-specific antigen promoter: implications for intersection of androgen receptor and nuclear factor-kappaB signalling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of FGF8 expression by the androgen receptor in human prostate cancer.', 'Interplay of nuclear factor-kappaB and B-myb in the negative regulation of androgen receptor expression by tumor necrosis factor alpha.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Tissue factor as a new target for tumor therapy-killing two birds with one stone: a narrative review.', 'Do coagulation or fibrinolysis reflect the disease condition in patients with soft tissue sarcoma?', 'Association of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Therapies With Venous Thromboembolic Events in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A National Cohort Study.', 'High discrepancy in thrombotic events in non-small cell lung cancer patients with different genomic alterations.', 'Evaluation of different commercial antibodies for their ability to detect human and mouse tissue factor by western blotting.']"""

Methods:   Patients undergoing open (RRP), laparoscopic (LARP) or robot-assisted (RARP) RP in six centers in Germany and Austria were included. The primary endpoint was the total number of removed lymph nodes (LN) between the different surgical approaches according to recent guideline recommendations. Secondary endpoints were the number of patients undergoing a sufficient PLND, defined as a removal of at least 10 LN and associated complication rates.  Results:   2634 patients undergoing RP were included (RRP: 66%, RARP/LARP: 34%). PLND was performed in 88% (RRP: 88.5%, RARP/LARP: 86.8%, p = 0.208). In intermediateor high risk PCa, PLND was performed in 97.2% (RRP: 97.7%, RARP/LARP: 96.2, p = 0.048). Of those, the mean number of LN was 19 (RRP: 19 vs. RARP/LARP: 17, p < 0.005) and sufficient PLND was observed in 84.6% of RRP compared to 77.2% of RARP/LARP (p < 0.005). Symptomatic lymphoceles requiring surgical treatment occurred more often in RRP than in RARP/LARP (4.0% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.001).  Conclusions:   The general guideline adherence regarding performing PNLD and the LN yield is high, regardless of the surgical approach. As expected, lymph node yield was higher when very experienced surgeons conducted the procedure. This should be considered in patients' counseling.""","""['Angelika Borkowetz', 'Johannes Bruendl', 'Martin Drerup', 'Jonas Herrmann', 'Hendrik Isbarn', 'Burkhard Beyer;GeSRU Academics Prostate Cancer Group']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Adherence of the indication to European Association of Urology guideline recommended pelvic lymph node dissection at a high-volume center: Differences between open and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'Development of symptomatic lymphoceles after radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection is independent of surgical approach: a single-center analysis.', 'Indication for and extension of pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: an analysis of five European institutions.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.']"""

They are of therapeutic interest because they confer increased sensitivity to radiation and cytotoxic therapy and hold potential for vaccination therapy.  Methods:   In this study, we analyzed more than 17,000 primary prostate cancer tissues with a mutation-specific antibody for the IDH1R132H mutation.  Results:   IDH1 mutation-specific staining was found in 42 of 15,531 (0.3%) interpretable cancers. IDH1 mutation was associated with higher preoperative PSA and Gleason grade (p < 0.05, each) but was unrelated to PSA recurrence. A comparison with other molecular tumor features available from earlier studies revealed that TMPRSS2-ERG fusion as well as deletion of PTEN, 5q21, 6q15, and 3p13 was less frequent in IDH1-mutated than in non-mutated cancer. Increased lethality of genetically instable, ""aberration-rich"" cancer cells in the presence of IDH1 mutations could possibly explain this observation. Heterogeneity analysis revealed a homogeneous mutation in only 1 of 16 IDH1-mutated cancers. This high degree of heterogeneity may profoundly limit therapeutic targeting of IDH1 mutations in prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   The data show that 0.3% of prostate cancers have an IDH1R132H mutation and that these are mostly heterogeneous.

This study aims to provide estimates of complete cancer prevalence in Italy by sex, age, and time since diagnosis for all cancers combined, and for selected cancer types. Projections were made up to 2020, overall and by time since diagnosis.  Methods:   Data were from 27 Italian population-based cancer registries, covering 32% of the Italian population, able to provide at least 7 years of registration as of December 2009 and follow-up of vital status as of December 2013. The data were used to compute the limited-duration prevalence, in order to estimate the complete prevalence by means of the COMPREV software.  Results:   In 2010, 2,637,975 persons were estimated to live in Italy after a cancer diagnosis, 1.2 million men and 1.4 million women, or 4.6% of the Italian population. A quarter of male prevalent cases had prostate cancer (n = 305,044), while 42% of prevalent women had breast cancer (n = 604,841). More than 1.5 million people (2.7% of Italians) were alive since 5 or more years after diagnosis and 20% since ≥15 years. It is projected that, in 2020 in Italy, there will be 3.6 million prevalent cancer cases (+ 37% vs 2010). The largest 10-year increases are foreseen for prostate (+ 85%) and for thyroid cancers (+ 79%), and for long-term survivors diagnosed since 20 or more years (+ 45%).

We ascertained 3,499 grandmother/granddaughter pairs from the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute observing 892 informative pairs with 157 affected granddaughters. We performed germline X-chromosome exome sequencing on 186 women with ovarian cancer from the registry. The rate of cancers was 28.4% in paternal grandmother/granddaughter pairs and 13.9% in maternal pairs consistent with an X-linked dominant model (Chi-square test X2 = 0.02, p = 0.89) and inconsistent with an autosomal dominant model (X2 = 20.4, p<0.001). Paternal grandmother cases had an earlier age-of-onset versus maternal cases (hazard ratio HR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.12-2.25) independent of BRCA1/2 status. Reinforcing the X-linked hypothesis, we observed an association between prostate cancer in men and ovarian cancer in his mother and daughters (odds ratio, OR = 2.34, p = 0.034). Unaffected mothers with affected daughters produced significantly more daughters than sons (ratio = 1.96, p<0.005). We performed exome sequencing in reported BRCA negative cases from the registry. Considering age-of-onset, one missense variant (rs176026 in MAGEC3) reached chromosome-wide significance (Hazard ratio HR = 2.85, 95%CI: 1.75-4.65) advancing the age of onset by 6.7 years. In addition to the well-known contribution of BRCA, we demonstrate that a genetic locus on the X-chromosome contributes to ovarian cancer risk. An X-linked pattern of inheritance has implications for genetic risk stratification.

Material and methods:   Data from 64 patients with prostate cancer were included. The patients received androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), next-generation hormonal therapy (NGH) or chemotherapy. The patients had a baseline scan and 1-3 subsequent scans during six months of treatment. Images were evaluated by experienced nuclear medicine physicians and classified for progressive disease (PD) or non-PD according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG-2) criteria. The patients were also classified as having PD/non-PD according to the clinical and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses.  Results:   There was no difference between NaF PET/CT and BS in the detection of PD and non-PD during treatment (McNemar's test, p = .18). The agreement between BS and NaF PET/CT for PD/non-PD was moderate (Cohen's kappa 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.79). Crude agreement between BS and NaF PET/CT for the assessment of PD/non-PD was 86% (89% for ADT, n = 28; 88% for NGH, n = 16, and 80% for chemotherapy, n = 20). In most discordant cases, BS found PD when NaF PET/CT did not, or BS detected PD on an earlier scan than NaF PET/CT. Biochemical progression (27%) occurred more frequently than progression on functional imaging (BS, 22% and NaF PET/CT, 14%). Clinical progression was rare (11%), and almost exclusively seen in patients receiving chemotherapy.  Conclusion:   There was no difference between NaF PET/CT and BS in the detection of PD and non-PD; however, BS seemingly detects PD by the PCWG-2 criteria earlier than NaF-PET, which might be explained by the fact that NaF-PET is more sensitive at the baseline scan.""","""['Randi Fuglsang Fonager', 'Helle Damgaard Zacho', 'Niels Christian Langkilde', 'Joan Fledelius', 'June Anita Ejlersen', 'Helle Westergreen Hendel', 'Christian Haarmark', 'Mette Moe', 'Jesper Carl Mortensen', 'Mads Ryø Jochumsen', 'Lars Jelstrup Petersen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['99mTc-HDP bone scintigraphy and 18F-sodiumfluoride PET/CT in primary staging of patients with prostate cancer.', 'A Prospective Comparison of 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT and PSMA-Targeted 18F-DCFBC PET/CT in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Prospective evaluation of planar bone scintigraphy, SPECT, SPECT/CT, 18F-NaF PET/CT and whole body 1.5T MRI, including DWI, for the detection of bone metastases in high risk breast and prostate cancer patients: SKELETA clinical trial.', '18F-NaF-PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy in the Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT Bone Scans in the Diagnosis of Metastatic Bone Disease from Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiomics for detecting prostate cancer bone metastases invisible in CT: a proof-of-concept study.', 'Salvage therapy for prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Observer Agreement and Accuracy of 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT in the Diagnosis of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer.', 'Uptake in non-affected bone tissue does not differ between 18F-DCFPyL and 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prospective comparison of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, 18F-sodium fluoride PET/CT and diffusion weighted-MRI at for the detection of bone metastases in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   Over the 6-year period of 2006-2012, three distinct pelvic LN dissection (PLND) strategies were used in chronological order at a single cancer referral hospital. Strategies were characterised by both an omission of PLND (pNx) vs inclusion decision threshold, and standard vs extended templates for patients selected for PLND. The three cohorts included: (i) omission vs standard template (04/2006-10/2007), for dominant Gleason score 4-5 or a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of >10 ng/mL; (ii) omission/standard vs extended template (11/2007-12/2010), for dominant Gleason score 4-5, PSA level of >10 ng/mL, any single core >7 mm, or >3 ipsilateral positive cores; and (iii) extended template with minimal exceptions (01/2011-08/2012). Standard outcomes data compared included: Clavien-Dindo complication rates, LN metrics (yield, percentage positive), and biochemical recurrence (BCR). A novel metric comprised 'pNx regret': the rate of pNx patients upgraded/upstaged. Exploratory analyses included selection criteria for reduced PLND templates, i.e. low-yield subsets.  Results:   Standard PLND yielded 8-10 LNs and a positive-LN yield of 2.2-6.2%. The addition of an extended PLND (E-PLND) significantly increased the yield to 14-20 LNs and the positive-LN yield to 17.4-18.4% (both P < 0.001). E-PLND had the highest impact on the percentage of positive LNs (%pN1) for high-risk disease (9.3 vs 32.8%, P = 0.002), modest for intermediate risk (4.2 vs 10.9%, P = 0.003), and minimal impact on low risk disease (4.1 vs 0%, P = 0.401). The combined strategies of setting a very low threshold for E-PLND and sending separate LN packets increased the LN yields (18 vs 24, P < 0.001), but did not significantly change the observed %pN1 rates by clinical risk group (P = 0.975). Efforts to reduce the need for E-PLND included omission by clinical criteria, but resulting in 'pNx regret' in 16-19%. A third of patients with unilateral disease and positive LNs were found to have contralateral disease. A subset of men with minimal biopsy volume Gleason score 4 + 3 had pN1 rates after E-PLND of three of 14 (21%) compared to minimal biopsy volume Gleason score 3 + 4 pN1 rates after E-PLND of 0 of 31. E-PLND takes about twice as long to perform but with no statistically significant difference in complications (5.0 vs 6.0%, P = 0.511). The 5-year BCR rates were higher for E-PLND, given the selection criteria, but not different for overall survival.  Conclusions:   The net benefit of E-PLND remains uncertain, and therapeutic impact will probably require a randomised trial, given the strong selection criteria. E-PLND contributes to oncological staging in a significant number of high- and intermediate-risk patients, and should be bilateral. Immediate concerns include longer operative times, but no higher complication rates.""","""['Muammer Altok', 'Kara Babaian', 'Mary F Achim', 'Grace C Achim', 'Patricia Troncoso', 'Surena F Matin', 'Brian F Chapin', 'John W Davis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Assessment of required nodal yield in a high risk cohort undergoing extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy and its impact on functional outcomes.', 'The extent of pelvic lymph node dissection correlates with the biochemical recurrence rate in patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection at robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Assessing utilization and nodal metastases within a statewide quality improvement consortium.', 'The Benefits and Harms of Different Extents of Lymph Node Dissection During Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of perioperative complications for extended vs standard pelvic lymph node dissection in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', ""Recommendations on robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a Brazilian experts' consensus."", 'Surgical management of high-risk, localized prostate cancer.', 'Impact of prostatic anterior fat pads with lymph node staging in prostate cancer.']"""

Plasma exposure of GPs was similar on day 1 and 7, suggesting no induction or inhibition of clearance pathways. Both free and conjugated GPs accumulated in all tissues including tumors. While non-cytotoxicity of 6-ginerol glucuronide precluded the role of conjugated GPs in cell death, the free forms were cytotoxic against prostate cancer cells. The efficacy of ginger was best explained by the reconversion of conjugated GPs to free forms by β-glucuronidase, which is over-expressed in the tumor tissue. This previously unrecognized two-step process suggests an instantaneous conversion of ingested free GPs into conjugated forms, followed by their subsequent absorption into systemic circulation and reconversion into free forms. This proposed model uncovers the mechanistic underpinnings of ginger's anticancer activity despite sub-therapeutic levels of free GPs in the plasma.""","""['Rao Mukkavilli', 'Chunhua Yang', 'Reenu Singh Tanwar', 'Roopali Saxena', 'Sushma R Gundala', 'Yingyi Zhang', 'Ahmed Ghareeb', 'Stephan D Floyd', 'Subrahmanyam Vangala', 'Wei-Wen Kuo', 'Padmashree C G Rida', 'Ritu Aneja']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Enterohepatic recirculation of bioactive ginger phytochemicals is associated with enhanced tumor growth-inhibitory activity of ginger extract.', 'Absorption, Metabolic Stability, and Pharmacokinetics of Ginger Phytochemicals.', ""Ginger's (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) inhibition of rat colonic adenocarcinoma cells proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro."", 'Protective and therapeutic potential of ginger (Zingiber officinale) extract and 6-gingerol in cancer: A comprehensive review.', 'Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) in cancer treatment.', '6-Shogaol, an Active Component of Ginger, Inhibits p300 Histone Acetyltransferase Activity and Attenuates the Development of Pressure-Overload-Induced Heart Failure.', 'Formulation of Phytosomes with Extracts of Ginger Rhizomes and Rosehips with Improved Bioavailability, Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Effects In Vivo.', 'Pharmacokinetics of Gingerols, Shogaols, and Their Metabolites in Asthma Patients.', 'Potential Role of Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) in the Prevention of Neurodegenerative Diseases.', ""Post-Ischemic Brain Neurodegeneration in the Form of Alzheimer's Disease Proteinopathy: Possible Therapeutic Role of Curcumin.""]"""

Design:   Population based cohort study.  Setting and participants:   104 980 participants aged at least 18 years (median age 42.8 years) from the French NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-17). Dietary intakes were collected using repeated 24 hour dietary records, designed to register participants' usual consumption for 3300 different food items. These were categorised according to their degree of processing by the NOVA classification.  Main outcome measures:   Associations between ultra-processed food intake and risk of overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer assessed by multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors.  Results:   Ultra-processed food intake was associated with higher overall cancer risk (n=2228 cases; hazard ratio for a 10% increment in the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet 1.12 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.18); P for trend<0.001) and breast cancer risk (n=739 cases; hazard ratio 1.11 (1.02 to 1.22); P for trend=0.02). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for several markers of the nutritional quality of the diet (lipid, sodium, and carbohydrate intakes and/or a Western pattern derived by principal component analysis).  Conclusions:   In this large prospective study, a 10% increase in the proportion of ultra-processed foods in the diet was associated with a significant increase of greater than 10% in risks of overall and breast cancer.

Here, we monitored mechanical errors and their impact on dose distributions in VMDWAT using logfiles throughout the course of treatment.  Methods:   Fifteen patients were enrolled (2 skull base tumor patients and 13 prostate cancer patients). VMDWAT plans were created for the enrolled patients. The prescribed dose for the skull base tumor was set as 54 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction, and that for the prostate cancer was set as 72 to 78 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction. We acquired logfiles to monitor mechanical errors and their impact on dose distribution in each fraction. The root mean square error (RMSE) in the multi-leaf collimator (MLC), gantry angle, O-ring angle and monitor unit (MU) were calculated using logfiles throughout the course of VMDWAT for each patient. The dosimetric impact of mechanical errors throughout the course of VMDWAT was verified using a logfile-based dose reconstruction method. Dosimetric errors between the reconstructed plans and the original plans were assessed.  Results:   A total of 517 datasets, including 55 datasets for the 2 skull base tumor patients and 462 datasets for the 13 prostate cancer patients, were acquired. The RMSE values were less than 0.1 mm, 0.2°, 0.1°, and 0.4 MU for MLC position, gantry angle, O-ring angle, and MU, respectively. For the skull base tumors, the absolute mean dosimetric errors and two standard deviations throughout the course of treatment were less than 1.4% and 1.1%, respectively. For prostate cancer, these absolute values were less than 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. The largest dosimetric error of 2.5% was observed in a skull base tumor patient. The resultant dosimetric error in the accumulated daily delivered dose distribution, in the patient with the largest error, was up to 1.6% for all dose-volumetric parameters relative to the planned dose distribution.  Conclusions:   MLC position, gantry rotation, O-ring rotation and MU were highly accurate and stable throughout the course of treatment. The daily dosimetric errors due to mechanical errors were small. VMDWAT provided high delivery accuracy and stability throughout the course of treatment.  Trial registration:   UMIN000023870 .

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-FGF receptor (FGFR)-Src kinase axis is one of the major signal transduction pathways to mediate this cross talk. Numerous genomic studies have demonstrated that expression levels of FGFR/Src are deregulated in a variety of cancers including prostate cancer; however, the role that paracrine FGF (from stromal cells) plays in dysregulated expression of epithelial FGFRs/Src and tumor progression in vivo is not well evaluated. In this study, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of wild-type FGFR1/2 or Src kinase in epithelial cells was not sufficient to initiate prostate tumorigenesis under a normal stromal microenvironment in vivo. However, paracrine FGF10 synergized with ectopic expression of epithelial FGFR1 or FGFR2 to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Additionally, paracrine FGF10 sensitized FGFR2-transformed epithelial cells to initiate prostate tumorigenesis. Next, paracrine FGF10 also synergized with overexpression of epithelial Src kinase to high-grade tumors. But loss of the myristoylation site in Src kinase inhibited paracrine FGF10-induced prostate tumorigenesis. Loss of myristoylation alters Src levels in the cell membrane and inhibited FGF-mediated signaling including inhibition of the phosphotyrosine pattern and FAK phosphorylation. Our study demonstrates the potential tumor progression by simultaneous deregulation of proteins in the FGF/FGFRs/Src signal axis and provides a therapeutic strategy of targeting myristoylation of Src kinase to interfere with the tumorigenic process.""","""['Qianjin Li', 'Lishann Ingram', 'Sungjin Kim', 'Zanna Beharry', 'Jonathan A Cooper', 'Houjian Cai']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Pharmacologically targeting the myristoylation of the scaffold protein FRS2α inhibits FGF/FGFR-mediated oncogenic signaling and tumor progression.', 'Directionally specific paracrine communication mediated by epithelial FGF9 to stromal FGFR3 in two-compartment premalignant prostate tumors.', 'Alterations in expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 and its receptor FGFR-1 in human prostate cancer.', 'FGFR inhibitors: Effects on cancer cells, tumor microenvironment and whole-body homeostasis (Review).', 'Targeting the Oncogenic FGF-FGFR Axis in Gastric Carcinogenesis.', 'Identification of Src as a Therapeutic Target in Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma through Functional Genomic and High-Throughput Drug Screening Approaches.', 'FGF/FGFR-Dependent Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Anti-Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma as a model to understand paracrine and senescence-induced tumourigenesis.', 'FGF/FGFR Signaling in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: From Carcinogenesis to Recent Therapeutic Intervention.', 'Src is essential for the endosomal delivery of the FGFR4 signaling complex in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

In the prostate cancer (PC) cell line LNCaP, S42 did not induce AR transactivation but antagonized 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)‒induced AR activation. Next, we investigated whether S42 suppresses the growth of PC cell lines. Basal growth of LNCaP cells was significantly suppressed by treatment with S42 compared with vehicle, as determined by cell counting and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine assays. The suppressive effect of S42 on cell growth was evident in the AR-positive PC cells LNCaP and 22Rv1 and was slightly observed even in the AR-negative PC-3 cells. However, S42 did not induce apoptosis as determined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. S42 had an even greater suppressive effect on DHT-dependent LNCaP cell proliferation than on basal proliferation (P < 0.05). DHT treatment increased the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), a major signaling molecule for PC proliferation, and this was significantly inhibited by S42. DHT also significantly upregulated AR, insulinlike growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and insulin receptor (IR)-β protein levels, which were similarly reduced by S42 treatment. Importantly, S42 administration to mice attenuated the growth of LNCaP tumors and reduced tumor expression of the prostate-specific antigen, P504S, Ki67, and phosphorylated ERK-MAPK. These data suggest that S42 attenuates LNCaP tumor growth not by inducing apoptosis but by inhibiting the expression of proliferation-related receptors, including IGF-1R, IR, and AR, and by suppressing ERK-MAPK activation.

In this study, a total of 116 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 11 upregulated genes and 105 downregulated genes, were screened from LSCC samples and compared with adjacent noncancerous. Statistically significant differences (log 2-fold difference > 0.5 and adjusted P-value < .05) were found in this study in the expression between tumor and nontumor larynx tissue samples. Nine cancer hub genes were found to have a high predictive power to distinguish between tumor and nontumor larynx tissue samples. Interestingly, they also appear to contribute to the progression of LSCC and malignancy via the Jak-STAT signaling pathway and focal adhesion. The model could separate patients into high-risk and low-risk groups successfully when only using the expression level of mRNA signatures.

Endocrine resistance (CCND1, RAF1, RB1, and SMAD2) and Hippo signaling pathway (CCND1, LATS1, SMAD2, and TP53BP2) could be of importance in LSCC, because they had high connectivity degrees in the blue module.

We demonstrate that spatial characteristics of oncogenic signalling and therapy response can be modelled in precision-cut slices from Kras-driven non-small-cell lung cancer with varying histopathologies. Unexpectedly, profiling of in situ tumours demonstrated that signalling stratifies mostly according to histopathology, showing enhanced AKT and SRC activity in adenosquamous carcinoma, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity in adenocarcinoma. In addition, high intertumour and intratumour variability was detected, particularly of MAPK and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 activity. Using short-term treatment of slice explants, we showed that cytotoxic responses to combination MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-mTOR inhibition correlate with the spatially defined activities of both pathways. Thus, whereas genetic drivers determine histopathology spectra, histopathology-associated and spatially variable signalling activities determine drug sensitivity.

These FITC-labeled MSNs/PEG/Lycorine/Antibody were loaded with lycorine and anti-EpCAM antibody, and analyzed for endocytosis, biocompatibility, drug loading and release ability. Furthermore, the effects of FITC-labeled MSNs/PEG/Lycorine/Antibody on PC-3M cell line were also investigated. The results revealed that the FITC-labeled MSNs/PEG/Lycorine/Antibody contained excellent biocompatibility, as well as efficiently penetrated into cancer cells. Moreover, the FITC-labeled MSNs/PEG/Lycorine/Antibody nano-composites exhibited excellent drug release ability and induced PC-3M cell death more quickly, as compared to the free lycorine, even at relatively lower concentrations. In conclusion, the FITC-labeled MSNs/PEG/Lycorine/Antibody developed in this study could be used as promising candidates of drug carriers of lycorine for cancer chemotherapy with maximization of anticancer efficacy and reduction of the undesirable side effects to normal cells.""","""['Xiaoning Liu', 'Jingjing Kang', 'Hui Wang', 'Tao Huang', 'Chun Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nanosci Nanotechnol""","""['Lycorine is a novel inhibitor of the growth and metastasis of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Amplification of oxidative stress with lycorine and gold-based nanocomposites for synergistic cascade cancer therapy.', 'Synergistic effects of the immune checkpoint inhibitor CTLA-4 combined with the growth inhibitor lycorine in a mouse model of renal cell carcinoma.', 'Lycorine and organ protection: Review of its potential effects and molecular mechanisms.', 'Cytotoxicity studies of lycorine alkaloids of the Amaryllidaceae.', 'Evaluation on the inclusion behavior of β-cyclodextrins with lycorine and its hydrochloride.', 'Green Synthesized Montmorillonite/Carrageenan/Fe3O4 Nanocomposites for pH-Responsive Release of Protocatechuic Acid and Its Anticancer Activity.']"""

However, most CaP patients showing a first response to androgen deprivation will progress to a hormone refractory phase of the disease (HRPC) with a much poorer prognosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays an important role in CaP progression. Singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ET-1 gene reportedly have been associated with cancer progression and chemoresistance. In the present study, we explored the association of SNPs and haplotypes of the ET-1 gene with the risk of HRPC. We genotyped three SNPs (rs1800541, rs2070699 and rs5370) in the ET-1 gene in a case-control study; 234 CaP patients who developed HRPC within six years after androgen deprivation therapy was used as HRPC cases, and 234 age- and primary therapy-matched CaP patients who had not developed HRPC within six years after androgen deprivation therapy were used as non-HRPC controls. Our results revealed that the G allele at rs1800541 and the G allele at rs2070699 were respectively associated with reduced and increased risk of HRPC at borderline statistical significance (p=0.047 and p=0.058, respectively). With adjustment for potential confounders including body mass index, initial Gleason score at diagnosis of CaP, and post-treatment nadir serum PSA level, we found that rs1800541-rs2070699 TG haplotype was significantly associated with increased risk of HRPC (p=0.033; adjusted OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.37-5.04). In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence that a 2-SNP haplotype of the ET-1 gene is associated with increased risk of HRPC, which adds new insights into early identification of CaP patients who are likely to develop HRPC in a later stage of the disease.""","""['Dongliang Xu', 'Xiaohai Wang', 'Yuefen Lou']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Pharmazie""","""['Endothelin-1 gene polymorphisms and risk of chemoresistant pediatric osteosarcoma.', 'Endothelin-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms and risk of pulmonary metastatic osteosarcoma.', 'Serum miRNA-21: elevated levels in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer and potential predictive factor for the efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'Intermittent complete androgen blockade in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic factors for survival in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) after initial androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).', 'ET-1 promotes the growth and metastasis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via activating PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Genetic Polymorphisms and Pharmacotherapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

This study aimed to further investigate the functional relevance of prostatic Nox4 and determine whether pharmacological inhibition of stromal Nox4 abrogates paracrine-mediated PCa-relevant processes. RNA in situ hybridization revealed significantly elevated Nox4 mRNA levels predominantly in the peri-tumoral stroma of clinical PCa with intense stromal Nox4 staining adjacent to tumor foci expressing abundant TGFβ protein levels. At pharmacologically relevant concentrations, the Nox1/Nox4 inhibitor GKT137831 attenuated ROS production, CAF-associated marker expression and migration of TGFβ1-activated but not nonactivated primary human prostate fibroblasts. Similar effects were obtained upon shRNA-mediated silencing of Nox4 but not Nox1 indicating that GKT137831 primarily abrogates TGFβ1-driven fibroblast activation via Nox4 inhibition. Moreover, inhibiting stromal Nox4 abrogated the enhanced proliferation and migration of PCa cell lines induced by TGFβ1-activated prostate fibroblast conditioned media. These effects were not restricted to recombinant TGFβ1 as conditioned media from PCa cell lines endogenously secreting high TGFβ1 levels induced fibroblast activation in a stromal Nox4- and TGFβ receptor-dependent manner. Importantly, GKT137831 also attenuated PCa cell-driven fibroblast activation. Collectively, these findings suggest the TGFβ-Nox4 signaling axis is a key interface to dysregulated reciprocal stromal-epithelial interactions in PCa pathophysiology and provide a strong rationale for further investigating the applicability of Nox4 inhibition as a stromal-targeted approach to complement current PCa treatment modalities.""","""['Natalie Sampson', 'Elena Brunner', 'Anja Weber', 'Martin Puhr', 'Georg Schäfer', 'Cedric Szyndralewiez', 'Helmut Klocker']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['ROS signaling by NOX4 drives fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation in the diseased prostatic stroma.', 'The Nox1/4 Dual Inhibitor GKT137831 or Nox4 Knockdown Inhibits Angiotensin-II-Induced Adult Mouse Cardiac Fibroblast Proliferation and Migration.

The abundance of inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment suggests that such signaling plays key roles in tumor development and therapy efficacy. The JAK-STAT axis transduces signals of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferons (IFNs), mediates antiviral responses, and is frequently altered in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. However, how activation of JAK-STAT signaling with different cytokines regulates interactions between oncolytic viruses and PCa cells is not known. Here, we employ LNCaP PCa cells, expressing (or not) JAK1, activated (or not) with IFNs (α or γ) or IL-6, and infected with RNA viruses of different oncolytic potential (EHDV-TAU, hMPV-GFP, or HIV-GFP) to address this matter. We show that in JAK1-expressing cells, IL-6 sensitized PCa cells to viral cell death in the presence or absence of productive infection, with dependence on virus employed. Contrastingly, IFNα induced a cytoprotective antiviral state. Biochemical and genetic (knockout) analyses revealed dependency of antiviral state or cytoprotection on STAT1 or STAT2 activation, respectively. In IL-6-treated cells, STAT3 expression was required for anti-proliferative signaling. Quantitative proteomics (SILAC) revealed a core repertoire of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes, induced by IL-6 or IFNs. Oncolysis in the absence of productive infection, induced by IL-6, correlated with reduction in regulators of cell cycle and metabolism. These results call for matching the viral features of the oncolytic agent, the malignancy-induced genetic-epigenetic alterations to JAK/STAT signaling and the cytokine composition of the tumor microenvironment for efficient oncolytic virotherapy.""","""['Oded Danziger', 'Tal Pupko', 'Eran Bacharach', 'Marcelo Ehrlich']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['Combined genetic and epigenetic interferences with interferon signaling expose prostate cancer cells to viral infection.', 'IFN-λ Inhibits MiR-122 Transcription through a Stat3-HNF4α Inflammatory Feedback Loop in an IFN-α Resistant HCV Cell Culture System.', 'Inhibition of Jak1-dependent signal transduction in airway epithelial cells infected with adenovirus.', 'Interferon Independent Non-Canonical STAT Activation and Virus Induced Inflammation.', 'Induction and regulation of IFNs during viral infections.', 'The mechanisms on evasion of anti-tumor immune responses in gastric cancer.', 'Selective inhibitors of JAK1 targeting an isoform-restricted allosteric cysteine.', 'Inflammation-Driven Regulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2, and Their Cross-Interactions with Protective Soluble TNFα Receptors in Human Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Sandfly Fever Viruses Attenuate the Type I Interferon Response by Targeting the Phosphorylation of JAK-STAT Components.', 'The expression landscape of JAK1 and its potential as a biomarker for prognosis and immune infiltrates in NSCLC.']"""

Thus, cancer-secreted miRNAs can induce an osteoblastic or osteolytic phenotype in the bone metastatic microenvironment. In this study, we performed a comprehensive expression analysis of exosomal miRNAs secreted by several human cancer cell lines and identified eight types of human miRNAs that were highly expressed in exosomes from osteoblastic phenotype-inducing prostate cancer cell lines.

Objective:   To investigate the clinical significance of germline DNA-repair gene alterations in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving next-generation hormonal therapy (NHT), with a particular emphasis on BRCA/ATM mutations.  Design, setting, and participants:   We interrogated 50 genes for pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutations using leukocyte DNA from 172 mCRPC patients beginning treatment with first-line NHT with abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We assessed the impact of germline DNA-repair gene mutation status on ≥50% and ≥90% PSA responses, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), clinical/radiologic progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Survival outcomes were adjusted using propensity score-weighted multivariable Cox regression analyses.  Results and limitations:   Among 172 mCRPC patients included, germline mutations (in any DNA-repair gene) were found in 12% (22/172) of men, and germline BRCA/ATM mutations specifically in 5% (9/172) of men. In unadjusted analyses, outcomes to first-line NHT were better in men with germline BRCA/ATM mutations (vs no mutations) with respect to PSA-PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.47; p=0.061), PFS (HR 0.50; p=0.090), and OS (HR 0.28; p=0.059). In propensity score-weighted multivariable analyses, outcomes were superior in men with germline BRCA/ATM mutations with respect to PSA-PFS (HR 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.92; p=0.027), PFS (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.98; p=0.044), and OS (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.99; p=0.048), but not in men with non-BRCA/ATM germline mutations (all p>0.10). These results require prospective validation, and our conclusions are limited by the small number of patients (n=9) with BRCA/ATM mutations.  Conclusions:   Outcomes to first-line NHT appear better in mCRPC patients harboring germline BRCA/ATM mutations (vs no mutations), but not for patients with other non-BRCA/ATM germline mutations.

This disparity is likely explained by a combination of social, environmental, and genetic factors. A large number of susceptibility loci have been reported by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but the contribution of these loci to prostate cancer disparities is unclear. Here, we investigated the population structure of 68 previously reported GWAS loci and calculated genetic disparity contribution statistics to identify SNPs that contribute the most to differences in prostate cancer risk across populations. By integrating GWAS results with allele frequency data, we generated genetic risk scores for 45 African and 19 non-African populations. Tests of natural selection were used to assess why some SNPs have large allele frequency differences across populations. We report that genetic predictions of prostate cancer risks are highest for West African men and lowest for East Asian men. These differences may be explained by the out-of-Africa bottleneck and natural selection. A small number of loci appear to drive elevated prostate cancer risks in men of African descent, including rs9623117, rs6983267, rs10896449, rs10993994, and rs817826. Although most prostate cancer-associated loci are evolving neutrally, there are multiple instances where alleles have hitchhiked to high frequencies with linked adaptive alleles. For example, a protective allele at 2q37 appears to have risen to high frequency in Europe due to selection acting on pigmentation. Our results suggest that evolutionary history contributes to the high rates of prostate cancer in African and African American men.Significance: A small number of genetic variants cause an elevated risk of prostate cancer in men of West African descent.

However, resistance to steroidal inhibitors inevitably develops in patients, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2) is a nuclear receptor, originally characterized as an important regulator of some liver-specific metabolic genes. Here, we report that LRH-1, which exhibited an increased expression pattern in high-grade prostate cancer and CRPC xenograft models, functions to promote de novo androgen biosynthesis via its direct transactivation of several key steroidogenic enzyme genes, elevating intratumoral androgen levels and reactivating AR signaling in CRPC xenografts as well as abiraterone-treated CRPC tumors. Pharmacologic inhibition of LRH-1 activity attenuated LRH-1-mediated androgen deprivation and anti-androgen resistance of prostate cancer cells. Our findings not only demonstrate the significant role of LRH-1 in the promotion of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in CRPC via its direct transcriptional control of steroidogenesis, but also suggest targeting LRH-1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for CRPC management.Significance: These findings not only demonstrate the significant role of the nuclear receptor LRH-1 in the promotion of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in CRPC via its direct transcriptional control of steroidogenesis, but also suggest targeting LRH-1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for CRPC management.

In our study, ODM-204 inhibited the proliferation of androgen-dependent VCaP and LNCaP cells in vitro and reduced significantly tumour growth in a murine VCaP xenograft model in vivo. Intriguingly, after a single oral dose of 10-30 mg/kg, ODM-204 dose-dependently inhibited adrenal and testicular steroid production in sexually mature male cynomolgus monkeys. Similar results were obtained in human chorionic gonadotropin-treated male rats. In rats, leuprolide acetate-mediated (LHRH agonist) suppression of the circulating testosterone levels and decrease in weights of androgen-sensitive organs was significantly and dose-dependently potentiated by the co-administration of ODM-204.

Patients and methods:   A new AS protocol mandating image-guided baseline biopsies, annual mpMRI and 3-monthly prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, but which retained protocol re-biopsies, was tested. Pathological progression, treatment conversion and triggers for non-protocol biopsy were recorded prospectively.  Results:   Data from 157 men enrolled in the AS protocol (median age 64 years, PSA 6.8 ng/mL, follow-up 39 months) were interrogated. A total of 12 men (7.6%) left the AS programme by choice. Of the 145 men who remained, 104 had re-biopsies either triggered by a rise in PSA level, change in mpMRI findings or by protocol. Overall, 23 men (15.9%) experienced disease progression; pathological changes were observed in 20 men and changes in imaging results were observed in three men. Of these 23 men, 17 switched to treatment, giving a conversion rate of 11.7% (<4% per year). Of the 20 men with pathological progression, this was detected in four of them after a PSA increase triggered a re-biopsy, while in 10 men progression was detected after an mpMRI change. Progression was detected in six men, however, solely after a protocol re-biopsy without prior PSA or mpMRI changes. Using PSA and mpMRI changes alone to detect progression was found to have a sensitivity and specificity of 70.0% and 81.7%, respectively.  Conclusion:   Our AS protocol, with thorough baseline assessment and imaging-based surveillance, showed low rates of progression and treatment conversion.

Purpose:   To develop a new PartinMR model for organ-confined prostate cancer (OCPCA) by incorporating Partin table and mp-MRI with a support vector machine (SVM) analysis.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   In all, 541 patients with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer underwent mp-MRI.  Field strength:   T2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging with a 3.0T MR scanner.  Assessment:   Candidate predictors included age, prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, biopsy Gleason score (GS), and mp-MRI findings, ie, tumor location, Prostate Imaging and Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score, diameter (D-max), and 6-point MR stage. The PartinMR model with combination of a Partin table and mp-MRI findings was developed using SVM and 5-fold crossvalidation analysis.  Statistical tests:   The predicted ability of the PartinMR model was compared with a standard Partin and a modified Partin table (mPartin) which used for mp-MRI staging. Statistical tests were made by area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), adjusted proportional hazard ratio (HR), and a cost-effective benefit analysis.  Results:   The rate of OCPCA at prostatectomy was 46.4% (251/541). Using MR staging, mPartin table (AUC, 0.814, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.779-0.846, P = 0.001) is appreciably better than the Partin table (AUC, 0.730, 95% CI: 0.690-0.767). Contrarily, adding all MR variables, the PartinMR model (AUC, 0.891, 95% CI: 0.884-0.899, P < 0.001) outperformed any other scheme, with 79.3% sensitivity, 75.7% specificity, 79% positive predictive value, and 76.0% negative predictive value for OCPCA. MR stage represented the most influential predictor of extracapsular extension (HR, 2.77, 95% CI: 1.54-3.33), followed by D-max (2.01, 95% CI: 1.31-2.68), biopsy GS (1.64, 95% CI: 1.35-2.12), and PI-RADS score (1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.98).

We identified several dysregulated miRNAs, one of which was the tumor suppressor miR-1246. miR-1246 was downregulated in prostate cancer clinical tissues and cell lines and was selectively released into exosomes. Overexpression of miR-1246 in a prostate cancer cell line significantly inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo and increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, invasiveness, and migration in vitro miR-1246 inhibited N-cadherin and vimentin activities, thereby inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

The clinical target volume was defined as the prostate gland plus the proximal seminal vesicles. Critical OARs include the bladder wall, bowel, femoral heads, neurovascular bundle, penile bulb, rectal wall, urethra and urogenital diaphragm. Photon plan robustness was evaluated by simulating 2 mm isotropic setup variations. Comparative proton SBRT plans employing intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) were generated using robust optimization. Plan robustness was evaluated by simulating 2 mm setup variations and 3% or 1% Hounsfield unit (HU) calibration uncertainties.  Results:   Comparable maximum OAR doses are achievable between photon and proton SBRT, however, robust optimization results in higher maximum doses for proton SBRT. Rectal maximum doses are significantly higher for Robust proton SBRT with 1% HU uncertainty compared to photon SBRT (p = 0.03), whereas maximum doses were comparable for bladder wall (p = 0.43), urethra (p = 0.82) and urogenital diaphragm (p = 0.50). Mean doses to bladder and rectal wall are lower for proton SBRT, but higher for neurovascular bundle, urethra and urogenital diaphragm due to increased lateral scatter. Similar target conformality is achieved, albeit with slightly larger treated volume ratios for proton SBRT, >1.4 compared to 1.2 for photon SBRT.  Conclusion:   Similar treatment plans can be generated with IMPT compared to VMAT in terms of target coverage, target conformality, and OAR sparing when range and HU uncertainties are neglected. However, when accounting for these uncertainties during robust optimization, VMAT outperforms IMPT in terms of achievable target conformity and OAR sparing. Advances in knowledge: Comparison between achievable dose distributions using modern, robust optimization of IMPT for high dose per fraction SBRT regimens for the prostate has not been previously investigated.""","""['Lee C Goddard', 'N Patrik Brodin', 'William R Bodner', 'Madhur K Garg', 'Wolfgang A Tomé']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Comparison of organ-at-risk sparing and plan robustness for spot-scanning proton therapy and volumetric modulated arc photon therapy in head-and-neck cancer.', 'Proton arc reduces range uncertainty effects and improves conformality compared with photon volumetric modulated arc therapy in stereotactic body radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Assessment of IMPT versus VMAT plans using different uncertainty scenarios for prostate cancer.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT): a review of clinical outcomes-what is the clinical evidence for the most effective implementation?', 'Proton therapy needs further technological development to fulfill the promise of becoming a superior treatment modality (compared to photon therapy).', 'Simulation of an HDR ""Boost"" with Stereotactic Proton versus Photon Therapy in Prostate Cancer: A Dosimetric Feasibility Study.', 'New frontiers in proton therapy: applications in cancers.']"""

This has led to a surge in the efforts for identification of safer and more effective compounds which can modulate EMT and consequently inhibiting migration and invasion of PCa cells. We reported previously that Plectranthoic acid (PA), a natural compound isolated from the extracts of Ficus microcarpa, has the capability to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PCa cells. Here, we determined the effects of PA on EMT, migration, and invasion of PCa cells. Inhibition of EMT induced by different mitogens was effectively inhibited by PA treatment with subsequent decrease in migration of PCa cells. Employing a PCa cell culture model of TGF-β-induced EMT, we showed that PA has the ability to reverse EMT. PA treatment was associated with induction of epithelial markers and decrease in the expression of mesenchymal markers in PCa cells. Proteomic analysis identified Rac1 as the major cadherin signaling protein modulated with PA treatment. In silico studies indicated that PA docked to the CH domain of NEDD9 protein with an estimated free binding energy of -7.34 Kcal/moL. Our studies revealed significant inhibition of Rac1/NEDD9 pathway in PA treated cells thereby providing a molecular basis of the inhibitory effect of PA on PCa cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, our data suggest that PA should be investigated further as an adjuvant treatment in human PCa cells, given its potential as an anti-invasive agent.""","""['Nosheen Akhtar', 'Deeba N Syed', 'Rahul K Lall', 'Bushra Mirza', 'Hasan Mukhtar']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['NEDD9 crucially regulates TGF-β-triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion in prostate cancer cells: involvement in cancer progressiveness.', 'The pentacyclic triterpenoid, plectranthoic acid, a novel activator of AMPK induces apoptotic death in prostate cancer cells.', 'P21 activated kinase-1 mediates transforming growth factor β1-induced prostate cancer cell epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'The role of small GTPases of the Rho/Rac family in TGF-β-induced EMT and cell motility in cancer.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Ficus crocata leaf extracts decrease the proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells.', 'MicroRNAs and Natural Compounds Mediated Regulation of TGF Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Proteomic Technology ""Lens"" for Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Process Identification in Oncology.', 'Reversal of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition by Natural Anti-Inflammatory and Pro-Resolving Lipids.', 'Natural Plants Compounds as Modulators of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.']"""

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of different distant metastases pattern on the survival of patients with stage IV prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data queried for this study include prostate cancer (2010-2014) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Metastatic distribution information was provided for bone, brain, liver and lung. The overall survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to analyze survival outcome and risk factors.  Results:   A total of 265 900 eligible patients were identified from SEER database. Among these patients, stage of IV prostate cancer accounted for 7.53% (20 034/265 900) at diagnosis. Patients who suffered metastasis to either one of the four organs occupied 61.24% (12 268/20 034) in stage of IV patients. Comparing with other three single metastases, the patients with liver metastasis exhibited worst OS whose mean survival was 17.529 months (P < 0.001). The mean survival of metastases with bong and lung was 25.238 months, which was the best survival of the six forms with two metastatic sites (P < 0.001). The results of univariate survival analysis showed that metastatic forms, race, N-classification and differentiated grade did not have impact on the overall survival of patients with three metastatic sites (all, P > 0.05).  Conclusions:   In analysis of both one and two metastatic sites, patients with liver metastasis seemed to have worse survival outcome. On the other hand, bone metastasis had better outcome than other three visceral metastases.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of these drugs on dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfonation catalyzed by human liver and intestinal cytosols and human recombinant sulfotransferase enzymes (SULT2A1, SULT2B1b, and SULT2E1) and compared their effects to those of other antiandrogens (cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and danazol). Each of these chemicals (10 μM) inhibited DHEA sulfonation catalyzed by human liver and intestinal cytosols. Enzyme kinetic analysis showed that galeterone and abiraterone acetate inhibited human liver cytosolic DHEA sulfonation with apparent Ki values at submicromolar concentrations, whereas cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and danazol inhibited it with apparent Ki values at low micromolar concentrations. The temporal pattern of abiraterone formation and abiraterone acetate depletion suggested that the metabolite abiraterone, not the parent drug abiraterone acetate, was responsible for the inhibition of DHEA sulfonation in incubations containing human liver cytosol and abiraterone acetate. Consistent with this proposal, similar apparent Ki values were obtained, regardless of whether abiraterone or abiraterone acetate was added to the enzymatic incubation. Abiraterone was more effective than abiraterone acetate in inhibiting DHEA sulfonation when catalyzed by human recombinant SULT2A1 or SULT2B1b. In conclusion, galeterone and abiraterone are novel inhibitors of DHEA sulfonation, as determined in enzymatic incubations containing human tissue cytosol (liver or intestinal) or human recombinant SULT enzyme (SULT2A1, SULT2B1b, or SULT1E1).

Serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after the initial biopsy were analyzed for PSA kinetics. Clinicopathologic variables were evaluated according to the use of 5ARIs after the initial negative biopsy.  Results:   Of 419 patients with initial negative biopsies (median age=67.0 years, median PSA=6.31 ng/mL), 101 patients (24.1%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer at the repeat biopsy. An increase in PSA level at 18 months, compared to that at 6 months, was a predictor of a positive repeat biopsy. However, the use of 5ARIs was not identified as a predictor. Of 126 patients receiving 5ARI treatment after the initial biopsy, 30 (23.8%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer at the repeat biopsy. Increase in PSA level at more than two time points after 6 months of 5ARI treatment (odds ratio=4.84, p=0.005) was associated with cancer detection at the repeat biopsy. There were no significant 5ARI group-related differences in the detection rates of prostate and high-grade cancers (Gleason score ≥7).

We examined how alcohol consumption post-diagnosis was associated with survival after prostate cancer diagnosis. Men diagnosed with prostate cancer (n = 829) in Alberta, Canada between the years 1997 and 2000 were recruited into a population-based case-control study and then followed for up to 19 years for survival outcomes.

Cox proportional hazards were used to examine how post-diagnosis alcohol consumption was associated with all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality (competing risk analysis too), in addition to first recurrence/progression or new primary cancer. Most participants reported drinking alcohol (≥once a month for 6 months) post-diagnosis (n = 589, 71.0%).

Patients with high metastatic burden and/or with increased trabecular bone uptake could present a higher incidence of hematologic toxicity. We hypothesized that these two factors are predictors of bone marrow failure.  Material and methods:   A computer algorithm discriminated between trabecular bone (BVol) and tumor metastases (MVol) within pretherapeutic whole-body skeletal SPECT/CT (N = 47). The program calculated the metastatic invasion percent (INV%) as the MVol/(MVol + BVol) ratio and extracted the BVol mean counts. BVol counts were correlated to % drop of hemoglobin (Hb), leukocytes (WBC), and platelets (PLT) after 3/6 Ra-223 cycles. Patient-specific and computational-derived parameters were tested as predictors of hematologic toxicity with MANOVA.  Results: BVol counts correlated with drop of Hb (R = 0,65, p < 0.01) and PLT (R = 0,45, p < 0.01).

Using human prostate cancer samples and two human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and DU145), Tip60 protein expression and the acetylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutant (ATM) were analysed by western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Tip60 was downregulated with small interfering RNA. Cells were irradiated using X-rays at 0.25 Gy·min-1. Cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay. The expression of Tip60 protein was increased in radioresistant prostate cancer tissues in comparison with radiosensitive tissues, which was also confirmed in both irradiated DU145 and LNCaP cells. Furthermore, the acetylation of ATM was also upregulated in a time-dependent manner after irradiation of both DU145 and LNCaP cells. Additionally, depletion of Tip60 decreased the survival of LNCaP and DU145 cells by inducing apoptosis, reduced the acetylation of ATM and decreased the expression of phosphorylated ATM, Chk2 and cdc25A in both DU145 and LNCaP cells after X-ray irradiation.

The authors previously reported that statins decrease intracellular cholesterol levels in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. In de novo androgen synthesis, cholesterol is the primary material and certain enzymes have important roles. The present study aimed to determine whether simvastatin alters the expression of androgen synthesis-associated enzymes in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. A novel combination therapy of statins and other drugs that inhibit the overexpression of enzymes involved in androgen synthesis was explored. The cytotoxicity of simvastatin and meclofenamic acid was assessed in prostate cancer cells using MTS and migration assays. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations in the culture medium were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RAC-α-serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt) phosphorylation was detected by western blot analysis. Following treatment with simvastatin, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) expression increased in PC-3 (>60-fold) and LNCaP-LA cells, however not in 22Rv1 cells. Small interfering (si)RNA was used to clarify the effects of AKR1C3 expression. The reduction in AKR1C3 expression in PC-3 cells following siRNA transfection was not associated with basal cell proliferation and migration; however, treatment with simvastatin decreased cell proliferation and migration. The combination of simvastatin and meclofenamic acid, an AKR1C3 inhibitor, further enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation and migration compared with treatment with either drug alone. Furthermore, treatment with simvastatin attenuated insulin-like growth factor 1-induced Akt activation; however, the combination of simvastatin and meclofenamic acid further inhibited Akt activation.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the most common treatment for PCa. However, the majority of androgen-sensitive PCa patients will eventually develop resistance to ADT and the disease will become androgen-independent. There is, therefore, an immediate requirement to develop effective therapeutic techniques towards the treatment of recurrent PCa. Oxibendazole (OBZ) is an anthelmintic drug that has also shown promise in the treatment of malignancies. In the present study, the capability of OBZ to repress the growth of PCa cells was assessed in human androgen-independent PCa 22Rv1 and PC-3 cell lines. The growth of the 22Rv1 and PC-3 cell lines, as assessed with a trypan blue exclusion assay, was markedly inhibited by OBZ treatment in vitro, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of 0.25 and 0.64 µM, respectively. The mean size of 22Rv1 tumors in nude mice treated with OBZ (25 mg/kg/day) was 47.96% smaller than that of the control mice. Treatment with OBZ increased the expression of microRNA-204 (miR-204), as determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and the level of p53 as determined with western blotting, two well-characterized tumor suppressor genes. When miR-204 expression was knocked down by introduction of an miR-204 inhibitor, the inhibitory effect of OBZ was markedly reduced; however, when it was overexpressed, the inhibitory efficiency of OBZ was markedly higher, indicating that upregulation of miR-204 is key for the efficacy of OBZ. Additionally, OBZ was demonstrated with RT-qPCR to repress the expression of the androgen receptor, and by western blotting to reduce prostate-specific androgen in 22Rv1 cells.

Poor follow-up of high PSA values may lead to delayed diagnosis.  Objective:   To estimate the probabilities of follow-up (including retesting, prostate biopsies, diagnosis, and cause-specific death) for men undergoing prostate cancer testing at a population level.  Design, setting, and participants:   Cohort study design for men living in Stockholm with no previous diagnosis of prostate cancer between 2003 and 2015. Men were linked to the national health and population registries in Sweden. We report follow-up for men aged 50-79 yr at 2003 or at their index PSA test.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   State probabilities with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multistate Markov models.  Results and limitations:   Among men not previously diagnosed with prostate cancer with an initial PSA value of ≥10ng/ml, the proportions at 1 yr with no subsequent testing or only elevated PSA test values >3ng/ml were 21.7% (95% CI: 19.5, 23.9), 25.2% (95% CI: 23.9, 26.6), and 47.7% (95% CI: 46.2, 49.1) for those aged 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 yr, respectively. No significant changes were noticed when stratifying by comorbidities. Limitations include the lack of detail from patient medical charts. This detail would have allowed for more accurate assessment of appropriate clinical follow-up.  Conclusions:   Regardless of medical history, a large proportion of men with PSA≥10ng/ml were not followed appropriately at 1 yr after the index PSA test. This may partially explain why opportunistic testing is not as effective as screening within trials to reduce prostate cancer mortality.  Patient summary:   For men aged 50-69 yr, who undertake a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, a PSA level of >10ng/ml should prompt further investigation. However, we found that one out of 10 of these men did not receive repeat testing within 1 yr of the initial test.

Objective:   To develop prediction methods for utilizing serial PSA and evaluate frequency of collection.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data were collected from men enrolled in the multicenter Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study, for whom PSA data were measured and biopsies performed on prespecified schedules. We developed a PSAk parameter based on a linear mixed-effect model (LMEM) that accounted for serial PSA levels.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The association of diagnostic PSA and/or PSAk with time to reclassification (increase in cancer grade and/or volume) was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.  Results and limitations:   A total of 851 men met the study criteria; 255 (30%) had a reclassification event within 5 yr. Median follow-up was 3.7 yr. After adjusting for prostate size, time since diagnosis, biopsy parameters, and diagnostic PSA, PSAk was a significant predictor of reclassification (hazard ratio for each 0.10 increase in PSAk=1.6 [95% confidence interval 1.2-2.1, p<0.001]). The PSAk model improved stratification of risk prediction for the top and bottom deciles of risk over a model without PSAk. Model performance was essentially identical using PSA data measured every 6 mo to those measured every 3 mo. The major limitation is the reliability of reclassification as an end point, although it drives most treatment decisions.  Conclusions:   PSAk calculated using an LMEM statistically significantly predicts biopsy reclassification. Models that use repeat PSA measurements outperform a model incorporating only diagnostic PSA. Model performance is similar using PSA assessed every 3 or 6 mo.

Objective:   To define the association between negative surveillance PNBs and risk of reclassification on AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   All men were enrolled in the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (PASS) between 2008 and 2016. Men were included if they had Gleason ≤3+4 prostate cancer and <34% core involvement ratio at diagnosis. Men were prescribed surveillance PNBs at 12 and 24 mo after diagnosis and then every 24 mo.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Reclassification was defined as an increase in Gleason grade and/or an increase in the ratio of biopsy cores to cancer to ≥34%. PNB outcomes were defined as follows: (1) no cancer on biopsy, (2) cancer without reclassification, or (3) reclassification. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models were performed to assess the risk of reclassification.  Results and limitations:   A total of 657 men met inclusion criteria. On first surveillance PNB, 214 (32%) had no cancer, 282 (43%) had cancer but no reclassification, and 161 (25%) reclassified. Among those who did not reclassify, 313 had a second PNB. On second PNB, 120 (38%) had no cancer, 139 (44%) had cancer but no reclassification, and 54 (17%) reclassified. In a multivariable analysis, significant predictors of decreased future reclassification after the first PNB were no cancer on PNB (hazard ratio [HR]=0.50, p=0.008), lower serum prostate-specific antigen, larger prostate size, and lower body mass index. A finding of no cancer on the second PNB was also associated with significantly decreased future reclassification in a multivariable analysis (HR=0.15, p=0.003), regardless of the first PNB result. The major limitation of this study is a relatively small number of patients with long-term follow-up.  Conclusions:   Men who have a surveillance PNB with no evidence of cancer are significantly less likely to reclassify on AS in the PASS cohort. These findings have implications for tailoring AS protocols.  Patient summary:   Men on active surveillance for prostate cancer who have a biopsy showing no cancer are at a decreased risk of having worse disease in the future. This may have an impact on how frequently biopsies are required to be performed in the future.""","""['James T Kearns', 'Anna V Faino', 'Lisa F Newcomb', 'James D Brooks', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Atreya Dash', 'William J Ellis', 'Michael Fabrizio', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Todd M Morgan', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Ian M Thompson', 'Andrew A Wagner', 'Yingye Zheng', 'Daniel W Lin']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Risk Stratification in Active Surveillance: A Dynamic, Ever-Evolving Practice.', 'Re: James T.

Microalgae (MA) have been identified as a promising source for these bioactive compounds, and this work aimed to evaluate the anti-proliferative effects of semi-purified protein extracted from MA against several tumor cell lines.  Methods:   Tested samples comprised MA cell extracts treated with cellulase and lysozyme, prior to extraction. The effect of dialysis, required to remove unnecessary small molecules, was also tested. The anti-cancer efficacies of the dialyzed and undialyzed extracts were determined by measuring cell viability after treating four human cancer cell lines, specifically A549 (human lung carcinoma), MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma), MDA MB-435 (human melanoma), and LNCap (human prostate cancer cells derived from a metastatic site in the lymph node). This was compared to the effects of the agents on the human BPH-1 cell line (benign human prostate epithelial cells). The t-test was used to statistically analyze the results and determine the significance.  Results:   Against LNCap and A549 cells, the performance of cellulase-treated extracts was better (with p-values < 0.05, as compared to the control) than that of lysozyme-treated preparations (with p-values mainly > 0.05, as compared to the control); however, they had similar effects against the other two tumor cell lines (with p-values mainly < 0.05, as compared to the control). Moreover, based on their effect on BPH-1 cells, extracts from lysozyme-treated MA cells were determined to be safer against the benign prostate hyperplasia cells, BPH-1 (with p-values mainly > 0.05, as compared to the control). After dialysis, the performance of MA extracts from lysozyme-treated cells was enhanced significantly (with p-values dropping to < 0.05, as compared to the control).

It is a multifactorial disease involving genetics together with environmental factors. Countries where men have greater dietary fat intake showed increased prostate cancer mortality rates. A population based case-control study was conducted to evaluate various prostate cancer risk factors. Study subjects were 896 prostate cancer cases (2010-2015) and 900 age matched controls. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were used to estimate the association between different risk factors and prostate cancer. P values for different factors were computed by t-test, chi-square test, and Fisher exact test. Results showed significant association of increased age (OR = 10.6; CI: 7.92-14.31; P = 0.0001; Z = 15.7) and smoking (P = 0.05) with risk of disease. Consistent evidence suggested that fruits (P = 0.0001), vegetables (P = 0.0007), and diabetes mellitus (OR = 0.84; CI: 0.72-0.97; P = 0.02; Z = 2.28) were significantly associated with decreased prostate cancer risk.

Traditional small scale laboratory synthesis techniques suffer from batch to batch variability. Additionally, the parameters used in the original formulation must be re-optimized due to differences in fabrication techniques for clinical production. Several low flow microfluidic synthesis processes have been reported in recent years for developing nanoparticles that are a hybrid between polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes. However, use of high flow microfluidic synthetic techniques has not been described for this type of nanoparticle system, which we will term as nanolipomer. In this manuscript, we describe the successful optimization and functional assessment of nanolipomers fabricated using a microfluidic synthesis method under high flow parameters.  Results:   The optimal total flow rate for synthesis of these nanolipomers was found to be 12 ml/min and flow rate ratio 1:1 (organic phase: aqueous phase). The PLGA polymer concentration of 10 mg/ml and a DSPE-PEG lipid concentration of 10% w/v provided optimal size, PDI and stability. Drug loading and encapsulation of a representative hydrophobic small molecule drug, curcumin, was optimized and found that high encapsulation efficiency of 58.8% and drug loading of 4.4% was achieved at 7.5% w/w initial concentration of curcumin/PLGA polymer. The final size and polydispersity index of the optimized nanolipomer was 102.11 nm and 0.126, respectively. Functional assessment of uptake of the nanolipomers in C4-2B prostate cancer cells showed uptake at 1 h and increased uptake at 24 h. The nanolipomer was more effective in the cell viability assay compared to free drug. Finally, assessment of in vivo retention in mice of these nanolipomers revealed retention for up to 2 h and were completely cleared at 24 h.  Conclusions:   In this study, we have demonstrated that a nanolipomer formulation can be successfully synthesized and easily scaled up through a high flow microfluidic system with optimal characteristics. The process of developing nanolipomers using this methodology is significant as the same optimized parameters used for small batches could be translated into manufacturing large scale batches for clinical trials through parallel flow systems.""","""['Andrew Gdowski', 'Kaitlyn Johnson', 'Sunil Shah', 'Ignacy Gryczynski', 'Jamboor Vishwanatha', 'Amalendu Ranjan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nanobiotechnology""","""['Scale up, optimization and stability analysis of Curcumin C3 complex-loaded nanoparticles for cancer therapy.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule aptamer functionalized PLGA-lecithin-curcumin-PEG nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery to human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells.', 'Microfluidic fabrication and characterization of Sorafenib-loaded lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles for controlled drug delivery.', 'Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles as a new generation therapeutic delivery platform: a review.', 'Formulation optimization of etoposide loaded PLGA nanoparticles by double factorial design and their evaluation.', 'Microfluidic-assisted silk nanoparticle tuning.', 'Facile production of quercetin nanoparticles using 3D printed centrifugal flow reactors.', 'Merits and advances of microfluidics in the pharmaceutical field: design technologies and future prospects.', 'Nanocarriers for ocular drug delivery: current status and translational opportunity.', 'Microfluidic assisted synthesis of PLGA drug delivery systems.']"""

The expression of estrogen receptor (ER)-β appears to be lost during prostate cancer progression through hypermethylation mechanism. Epigenetic drugs such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZAC) and Trichostatin A (TSA) showed efficacy in restoring ERβ expression in prostate cancer cells. This study was designed to explore the potential anti-carcinogenic effects resulting from re-expressing ERβ1 using 5-AZAC and/or TSA, followed by its stimulation with Diarylpropionitrile (DPN), a selective ERβ1 agonist, in prostate cancer cell line PC-3.  Main methods:   Cells were treated with 5-AZAC, TSA, DPN and their combination. Subsequently, they were subjected to proliferation assays, determinations of ERβ1 expression, protein levels of active caspase-3, cyclin D1, β-catenin and VEGF.  Key findings:   Treatment with these drugs exhibited an increase in ERβ1 expression to different extents as well as active caspase-3 levels. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in cyclin D1, VEGF and β-catenin levels was achieved as compared to the vehicle control group (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the triple combination regimen led to the most prominent anti-tumor responses in terms of increased apoptosis, reduced proliferation as well as angiogenesis.  Significance:   The results support the notion that ERβ1 acts as a tumor suppressor protein and suggest that sequential ERβ1 expression and activation can offer significant anti-tumor responses.

Objective:   To assess patient understanding of core cancer concepts, opinions on the cost and overall benefit of CRPC drugs, whether out-of-pocket costs would change opinions and whether patients would ultimately opt out of CRPC drug treatment for an end-of-life (EOL) premium.  Patients and methods:   We conducted a qualitative survey among patients with various PCa states ranging from active surveillance to CRPC and from various familial, financial and educational demographics. Through a series of hypothetical scenarios, we extrapolated opinions on CRPC drug value, efficacy and monetary worth. We assessed patient willingness to accept an EOL ($50,000) premium in lieu of CRPC drug treatment. Statistically, chi-squared analysis and Fisher's exact test were used when appropriate.  Results:   In total, 103 patients completed the questionnaire, one-half of whom did not understand ""advanced PCa"" state and more than one-third of the concept of palliative care despite multiple meetings with Urologists. Patients willingness-to-pay and proposed drug value was higher than that accepted by government when government funded, with costs exceeding $250,000 per person, but lower than that accepted by government when self-funded. A majority (60%) would accept/consider the EOL premium in the setting of CRPC. Patients with higher education were more skeptical about CRPC drug value and more likely to accept the EOL premium (P = 0.003.) CONCLUSION: Patients have an incomplete understanding of their own disease prognosis and its therapeutic options. This ultimately influences patient decision-making. Education, income and out-of-pocket costs diminished opinion of CRPC drugs considerably. As such, an EOL premium should be considered in subsets of patients.""","""['Tarik Benidir', 'Karen Hersey', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Rob Hamilton', 'Anthony M Joshua', 'Girish Kulkarni', 'Alexandre Zlotta', 'Neil Fleshner']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""[""Patients' preferences for delaying metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Combining health state and treatment valuation."", 'The Role of PCA 3 as a Prognostic Factor in Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Treated with Docetaxel.', 'Should we involve patients more actively?

Methods:   Eighty-four patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and measurement of PSA levels in the same week (trigger-PSA) were studied in this retrospective analysis. MTV was calculated from the sum of the metastatic lesions. To determine the association between trigger-PSA level and PET/CT findings, Spearman rank correlation was used.  Results:   The median MTV of metastatic bone disease (mBD) was significantly higher than in metastatic lymph-nodes (mLN) (139.5 versus 17.7; P<.05). Disease was limited to the prostate in 8 patients (9.5%), mLN in 21 patients (25%), mBD in 32 patients (38.1%) and the 3 sites (prostate, mLN, and mBD) in 17 patients (20.2%). In 6 patients (6.14%), 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT was not capable of detecting disease. The median trigger-PSA levels of patients with disease limited to the prostate (2.8ng/mL), mLN (6.8ng/mL), and for mBD (16.8ng/mL) was statically significant (P<.05). Positive patients had a mean trigger-PSA of 4.3ng/mL vs 1.5ng/mL in negative patients (P<.05). We established 3 threshold-points for trigger-PSA level detection rate:≤1ng/mL (47.3%), 1-4ng/mL (68.4%) and≥4ng/mL (96.7%). When trigger-PSA exceeded 4ng/mL, the MTV was higher (P<.001).  Conclusion:   The correlation of MTV with trigger-PSA is demonstrated, which may have an impact on management.

However, opportunistic screening for prostate cancer is still wanted by many patients and it is widely used in primary care clinics, with potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Better tools for risk assessment have been called for, to better target such opportunistic screening. Our aim was to explore perceptions about prostate cancer risk and subsequent opportunistic screening among patients who were not at increased risk of prostate cancer after a first PSA test plus a genetic lifetime risk assessment.  Methods:   We undertook semi-structured patient interviews with recording and verbatim transcription of interviews. Data were analysed thematically.  Results:   Three themes were identified: uncertainty of the nature of prostate cancer; perceived benefits of testing; and conflicting public health recommendations. Prostate cancer was spoken of as an inescapable risk in older age. The aphorism ""you die with it, not from it"" was prominent in the interviews but patients focused on the benefits of testing now rather than the future risks associated with treatment relating to potential overdiagnosis. Many expressed frustration with perceived mixed messages about early detection of cancer, in which on one side men feel that they are encouraged to seek medical testing to act responsibly regarding the most common cancer disease in men, and on the other side they are asked to refrain from opportunistic testing for prostate cancer. Taken together, personal risks of prostate cancer were perceived as high in spite of a normal PSA test and a genetic lifetime risk assessment showing no increased risk.  Conclusion:   Patients saw prostate cancer risk as high and increasing with age. They focused on the perceived benefit of early detection using PSA testing. It was also commonly acknowledged that most cases are indolent causing no symptoms and not shortening life expectancy. There was a frustration with mixed messages about the benefit of early detection and risk of overdiagnosis. These men's genetic lifetime risk assessment showing no increased risk did not appear to influence current intentions to get PSA testing in the future.""","""['Pia Kirkegaard', 'Adrian Edwards', 'Trine Laura Overgaard Nielsen', 'Torben Falck Ørntoft', 'Karina Dalsgaard Sørensen', 'Michael Borre', 'Flemming Bro']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Fam Pract""","""['Screening for Prostate Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.', 'Structured Population-based Prostate-specific Antigen Screening for Prostate Cancer: The European Association of Urology Position in 2019.', ""Factors influencing Nigerian men's decision to undergo prostate specific antigen testing."", 'Prostate-specific antigen testing and prostate cancer screening.', 'Early detection, PSA screening, and management of overdiagnosis.', ""Men's experiences of receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis after opportunistic screening-A qualitative descriptive secondary analysis."", ""A genetic risk assessment for prostate cancer influences patients' risk perception and use of repeat PSA testing: a cross-sectional study in Danish general practice.""]"""

Here, we demonstrate that RCN1 is overexpressed in clinical prostate cancer (PCa) samples, associated with cyclin B, not cyclin D1 expression, compared to that of benign tissues in a Chinese Han population. Downregulation of endogenous RCN1 significantly suppresses PCa cell viability and arrests the cell cycles of DU145 and LNCaP cells at the S and G2/M phases, respectively. RCN1 depletion causes ER stress, which is evidenced by induction of GRP78, activation of PERK and phosphorylation of eIF2α in PCa cells. Remarkably, RCN1 loss triggers DU145 cell apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner but mainly causes necroptosis in LNCaP cells. An animal-based analysis confirms that RCN1 depletion suppresses cell proliferation and promotes cell death. Further investigations reveal that RCN1 depletion leads to elevation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and inactivation of AKT in DU145 cells. Silencing of PTEN partially restores apoptotic cells upon RCN1 loss. In LNCaP cells, predominant activation of CaMKII is important for necroptosis in response to RCN1 depletion.

Following monolayer and spheroid culture, DU145 cells were treated with different doses of hyperthermia, electron beam and combination of them. The survival and self-renewing of the cells were evaluated by colony formation assay (CFA) and spheroid formation assay (SFA). Flowcytometry results indicated that the percentage of CD133+/CD44+ cells in spheroid culture was 13.9-fold higher than in the monolayer culture. The SFA showed significant difference between monolayer and spheroid culture for radiation treatment (6 Gy) and hyperthermia (60 and 90 min). The CFA showed significantly enhanced radiosensitivity in DU145 cells grown as monolayer as compared to spheroids, but no effect of hyperthermia. In contrast, for the combination of radiation and hyperthermia the results of CFA and SFA showed a reduced survival fraction in both cultures, with larger effects in monolayer than in spheroid culture.

To further our knowledge, we have evaluated PSM status in 107 laparoscopic radical prostatectomies using digital and conventional light microscopy (LM). DM evaluation detected three additional PSM cases, but no differences were seen (LM vs DM; p = 0.220). Mean linear measurement correlated to biochemical recurrence (BR) (LM, p = 0.002; DM, p = 0.001). ROC analysis identified a cut-off point to assess linear measurement by LM (3.5 mm) or DM (3.2 mm), but only digital measurement was significant for BR-free survival. Our study also evaluated a cut-off ≤ 3 mm that was associated to BR using LM (p = 0.023) or DM (p = 0.001). Finally, the number of paraffin blocks bearing PSM correlated with BR (p < 0.001) status with either LM or DM. In conclusion, DM produces similar data than LM but shows more accurate measurements. Reporting of PSM with score of ≤ 3 vs. > 3 mm linear extent using LM (3.2 mm if digital microscopy is applied) might represent an important prognostic feature after radical prostatectomy.

Methods:   Subjects were men aged 50-69 years with PSA < 10 ng/mL from the UK-based Prostate Testing for cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study. Men with prostate cancer were categorized as high or low risk of progression (Low risk: Gleason score ≤ 6 and stage T1-T2a; High risk: Gleason score 7-10 or stage T2C). Men without prostate cancer were those with no histological confirmation of prostate cancer. Previously developed longitudinal reference ranges for normal age-related PSA change were used to calculate an age-specific PSA threshold. We compared the ability of our age-specific PSA threshold to discriminate between high- and no/low-risk prostate cancer with that of two existing thresholds: (i) threshold of PSA = 3 ng/ml for all ages; (ii) National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines dependent on age-group thresholds (age 50-59: PSA = 3 ng/mL; age 60-70: PSA = 4 ng/mL; age ≥ 70: PSA = 5 ng/mL).  Results:   We included 823 men with high-risk prostate cancer and 80,721 men with no/low-risk prostate cancer. A threshold of PSA = 3 ng/ml for all ages identified more high-risk prostate cancers, recommending biopsy in 9.8% of men, of which 10.3% (n = 823) had high-risk prostate cancer. Using the NICE guidelines as the threshold for biopsy, 6.9% men were recommended for biopsy, of which 11.9% (n = 668) had high-risk prostate cancer. Using the new age-specific threshold for biopsy, 2.3% men were recommended for biopsy, of which 15.2% (n = 290) had high-risk prostate cancer. The age-specific threshold identified fewer high-risk prostate cancers, but fewer men received unnecessary biopsy.

These binding proteins inhibit protein synthesis, but are inactivated by mTOR to stimulate cell growth and metabolism. However, the role of these proteins in the context of aberrant activation of mTOR, which occurs frequently in cancers through loss of PTEN or mutational activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, is unclear. Here, even under conditions of aberrant mTOR activation, hypoxia causes dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1/4E-BP2 and increases their association with eIF4E to suppress translation. This is essential for hypoxia tolerance as knockdown of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 decreases proliferation under hypoxia and increases hypoxia-induced cell death. In addition, genetic deletion of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 significantly accelerates all phases of cancer development in the context of PTEN loss-driven prostate cancer in mice despite potent PI3K/AKT and mTOR activation. However, even with a more rapid onset, tumors that establish in the absence of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 have reduced levels of tumor hypoxia and show increased cell death within hypoxic tumor regions. Together, these data demonstrate that 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 act as essential metabolic breaks even in the context of aberrant mTOR activation and that they are essential for the creation of hypoxia-tolerant cells in prostate cancer.

However, current approaches for molecular characterization are primarily tissue based, necessitating serial biopsies to understand changes over time and are limited by the challenges inherent to extracting genomic material from predominantly bone metastases. Therefore, a circulating tumor cell (CTC)-based assay was developed to determine gene expression across a panel of clinically relevant and potentially actionable prostate cancer-related genes. CTCs were isolated from the whole blood of mCRPC patients (n = 41) and multiplex qPCR was performed to evaluate expression of prostate cancer-related target genes (n = 78). A large fraction of patients (27/41, 66%) had detectable CTCs. Increased androgen receptor (AR) expression (70% of samples) and evidence of Wnt signaling (67% of samples) were observed. The TMPRSS2:ERG fusion was expressed in 41% of samples, and the aggressive prostate cancer-associated long noncoding RNA SChLAP1 was upregulated in 70%. WNT5a [HR 3.62, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.63-8.05, P = 0.002], AURKA (HR 5.56, 95% CI, 1.79-17.20, P = 0.003), and BMP7 (HR 3.86, 95% CI, 1.60-9.32, P = 0.003) were independently predictive of overall survival (FDR < 10%) after adjusting for a panel of previously established prognostic variables in mCRPC (Halabi nomogram). A model including Halabi, WNT5a, and AURKA expression, termed the miCTC score, outperformed the Halabi nomogram alone (AUC = 0.89 vs. AUC = 0.70). Understanding the molecular landscape of CTCs has utility in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with aggressive prostate cancer and provides an additional tool in the arsenal of precision-based therapeutic approaches in oncology.Implications: Analysis of CTC gene expression reveals a clinically prognostic ""liquid biopsy"" signature in patients with metastatic castrate-resistance prostate cancer.

However, direct detection of the methylated DNAs in clinically relevant samples is still challenging because of its extremely low concentration (~fM). Here, an integrated microfluidic chip is reported, which is capable of pre-concentrating the methylated DNAs using ion concentration polarization (ICP) and electrochemically detecting the pre-concentrated DNAs on a single chip. The proposed chip is the first demonstration of an electrochemical detection of both level and concentration of the methylated DNAs by integrating a DNA pre-concentration unit without gene amplification. Using the proposed chip, 500 fM to 500 nM of methylated DNAs is pre-concentrated by almost 100-fold in 10 min, resulting in a drastic improvement of the electrochemical detection threshold down to the fM level. The proposed chip is able to measure not only the DNA concentration, but also the level of methylation using human urine sample by performing a consecutive electrochemical sensing on a chip. For clinical application, the level as well as the concentration of methylation of glutathione-S transferase-P1 (GSTP1) and EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1), which are known to be closely associated with prostate cancer diagnosis, are electrochemically detected in human urine spiked with these genes. The developed chip shows a limit of detection (LoD) of 7.9 pM for GSTP1 and 11.8 pM for EFEMP1 and is able to detect the level of methylation in a wide range from 10% to 100% with the concentration variation from 50 pM to 500 nM.""","""['Sung A Hong', 'Yong-June Kim', 'Sung Jae Kim', 'Sung Yang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Detection of Methylated DNA on a Power-Free Microfluidic Chip with Laminar Flow-Assisted Dendritic Amplification.', 'Electrochemical DNA biosensor for detecting cancer biomarker related to glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) hypermethylation in real samples.', 'Methylation-specific sequencing of GSTP1 gene promoter in circulating/extracellular DNA from blood and urine of healthy donors and prostate cancer patients.', 'A review of microfabricated electrochemical biosensors for DNA detection.', 'Integrated electrochemical DNA biosensors for lab-on-a-chip devices.', 'Microvalve-Based Tunability of Electrically Driven Ion Transport through a Microfluidic System with an Ion-Exchange Membrane.', 'Label-free electrochemical microfluidic biosensors: futuristic point-of-care analytical devices for monitoring diseases.', 'Beyond liquid biopsy: Toward non-invasive assays for distanced cancer diagnostics in pandemics.', 'Evolution of nucleic acids biosensors detection limit III.', 'Sensitive electrochemical biosensor combined with isothermal amplification for point-of-care COVID-19 tests.']"""

The inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) offers patients a definitive treatment option when ED is refractory to medical therapies. Because of the hostile postoperative anatomy of these patients, a careful surgical approach is necessary for successful outcomes and to avoid adjacent organ injury. To date, there is no series describing the outcomes of 3-piece IPP placement in patients with urinary diversions.  Aim:   To present contemporary outcomes and a description of our technique in placing a 3-piece IPP for postoperative ED in patients with a history of RC with orthotopic neobladder, ileal conduit, or continent cutaneous diversion.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 80 patients who underwent primary placement of a 3-piece IPP (AMS 700; American Medical Systems Inc, Minnetonka, MN, USA) after RC and urinary diversion from 2003 through 2016. 79 patients underwent RC in their treatment of urologic malignancy (71 for bladder cancer, 8 for prostate cancer) and 1 underwent RC for refractory interstitial cystitis. An infrapubic approach was used in most patients, with reservoir placement in the lateral retroperitoneal space through a counterincision medial to the anterior superior iliac spine. Patient demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative outcomes including prosthetic infection and mechanical failure were examined and statistical analysis was performed.  Outcomes:   Rates of device infection, revision surgery, and reservoir complications.  Results:   After mean follow-up of 53.9 months (6.5-150.7 months), 4 patients developed infection of the prosthesis that required explantation. 3 of those patients underwent successful IPP reimplantation. 5 patients required revision surgery (pump replacement, n = 3; pump relocation, n = 1; cylinder replacement for cylinder aneurysm, n = 1) for mechanical failure. No statistically significant associations were found between infection and comorbidities, urinary diversion, exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, or presence of an artificial urinary sphincter.  Clinical implications:   The 3-piece IPP is an effective treatment option for medication-refractory ED that can be placed safely in patients with all forms of urinary diversion.  Strengths and limitations:   This study represents the 1st series that describes a successful technique and long-term outcomes of patients with urinary diversion. It is limited by its single-surgeon, single-center experience and lacks validated patient satisfaction data in follow-up.  Conclusions:   The 3-piece IPP, with reservoir placement in the lateral retroperitoneum, can be implanted successfully in patients with all forms of urinary diversion without a significant increase in infectious complications, reservoir erosion, or mechanical failure.

Web sites were analyzed according to a 50-item list of validated health care information quality measures. Web sites were graded by 2 blinded reviewers. Interrater agreement was confirmed by Cohen kappa coefficient.  Results:   Ninety percent of Web sites addressed PSA screening. Cancer center sites covered 45% of topics surveyed, whereas organization Web sites addressed 70%. All organizational Web pages addressed the possibility of false-positive screening results; 41% of cancer center Web pages did not. Forty percent of cancer center Web pages also did not discuss next steps if a PSA test was positive. Only 6% of cancer center Web pages were rated by our reviewers as ""superior"" (eg, addressing >75% of the surveyed topics) versus 20% of organizational Web pages.

The current view regarding these 2 treatment algorithms among North American genitourinary (GU) experts is not known.  Methods:   A survey was distributed to 88 practicing North American GU physicians serving on decision-making committees of cooperative group research organizations. Questions pertained to opinions regarding BT as monotherapy for low-risk PCa and BT boost for HR PCa. Responders were asked to self-identify as BT experts versus non-experts. Treatment recommendations were correlated with practice patterns using the Fisher exact test.  Results:   Forty-two radiation oncologists completed the survey, of whom 23 (55%) recommend EBRT and ADT alone and 19 (45%) recommend addition of BT boost. Twenty-five participants (60%) identified themselves as BT experts. Nearly 90% of those recommending BT boost were BT experts versus approximately 10% of non-BT experts (P < .001). Responders who recommended BT monotherapy as first-choice treatment for low-risk PCa were more likely to recommend BT boost for HR PCa (P < .0001).  Conclusions:   There is a dramatic polarization in opinions regarding incorporation of BT boost into EBRT + ADT therapy for patients with HR PCa among North American GU radiation oncology experts, who serve on decision-making committees and influence the national treatment guidelines and future clinical trials. Those who identify themselves as BT experts are significantly more likely to recommend BT boost.

We report that PVT1 promotes prostate cancer invasion and metastasis by modulating EMT. Furthermore, PVT1 can promote EMT by up-regulation of Twist1, a transcription factor associated with EMT. We then confirmed that PVT1 acts as a sponge for miRNA-186-5p and positively regulates Twist1 by a sponge effect.

Among eight cinnamic acid derivatives [chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, 3,4-caffeoylquinic acid, artepillin C (ArtC), baccharin, drupanin and caffeic acid phenethyl ester] in propolis, only ArtC showed high autophagy-inducing activity accompanying LC3-II upregulation. ArtC was also induced apoptosis as revealed by DNA fragmentation and increases in cleaved caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase. The apoptosis induced by ArtC was exacerbated by cotreatment with autophagy inhibitors (chloroquine, wortmannin and U0126). The cotreatment further induced necroptosis accompanying increased expression of receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinases 1 and 3. These data indicate that cytotoxicity of ArtC to the prostate cancer cells is dampened by induced autophagy, but is markedly augmented by inhibition of autophagy. Therefore, the combination of ArtC and autophagy inhibitors may be a novel complementary-alternative treatment for prostate cancer.""","""['Satoshi Endo', 'Manami Hoshi', 'Toshiyuki Matsunaga', 'Takahiro Inoue', 'Kenji Ichihara', 'Akira Ikari']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Ethanolic extract of Brazilian green propolis sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'Water extract of propolis and its main constituents, caffeoylquinic acid derivatives, exert neuroprotective effects via antioxidant actions.', 'Artepillin C, a major ingredient of Brazilian propolis, induces a pungent taste by activating TRPA1 channels.', 'Emerging Adjuvant Therapy for Cancer: Propolis and its Constituents.', 'Experimental Evidence for Therapeutic Potentials of Propolis.', 'Propolis: A Detailed Insight of Its Anticancer Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Propolis and Its Polyphenolic Compounds against Cancer.', 'Necroptosis and Prostate Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential.', 'Zerumbone mediates apoptosis and induces secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in breast carcinoma cell culture.', 'Autophagy and cancer treatment: four functional forms of autophagy and their therapeutic applications.']"""

Emerging evidence indicates that Wnt/β-catenin signaling also contributes to prostate development specifically through regulation of cell fate determination. Prostatic Axin2-expressing cells are able to respond to Wnt signals and possess the progenitor properties to regenerate prostatic epithelium. Despite critical roles of both signaling pathways, the biological significance of androgen receptor (AR) in Axin2-expressing/Wnt-responsive cells remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated this important question using a series of newly generated mouse models. Deletion of Ar in embryonic Axin2-expressing cells impaired early prostate development in both ex vivo and tissue implantation experiments. When Ar expression was deleted in prostatic Axin2-expressing cells at pre-puberty stages, it results in smaller and underdeveloped prostates. A subpopulation of Axin2 expressing cells in prostate epithelium is resistant to castration and, following androgen supplementation, is capable to expand to prostatic luminal cells. Deletion of Ar in these Axin2-expressing cells reduces their regenerative ability. These lines of evidence demonstrate an indispensable role for the Ar in Wnt-responsive cells during the course of prostate development, morphogenesis, and regeneration, which also imply an underlying interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways in the mouse prostate.

Methods/materials:   We reviewed 18 patients treated with SBRT for prostate cancer. An endorectal balloon was inserted at simulation and each treatment. Planning margins were 3 mm/0 mm posteriorly. Prior to each treatment, a dual image guidance protocol was applied to align three makers using stereoscopic x ray images and then to the soft tissue using kilo-voltage cone beam CT (kV-CBCT). After treatment, prostate (CTV), rectal wall, and bladder were delineated on each kV-CBCT, and delivered dose was recalculated. Dosimetric endpoints were analyzed, including V36.25 Gy for prostate, and D0.03 cc for bladder and rectal wall.  Results:   Following initial marker alignment, additional translational shifts were applied to 22 of 84 fractions after kV-CBCT. Among the 22 fractions, ten fractions exceeded 3 mm shifts in any direction, including one in the left-right direction, four in the superior-inferior direction, and five in the anterior-posterior direction. With and without the additional kV-CBCT shifts, the average V36.25 Gy of the prostate for the 22 fractions was 97.6 ± 2.6% with the kV x ray image alone, and was 98.1 ± 2.4% after applying the additional kV-CBCT shifts. The improvement was borderline statistical significance using Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P = 0.007). D0.03 cc was 45.8 ± 6.3 Gy vs. 45.1 ± 4.9 Gy for the rectal wall; and 49.5 ± 8.6 Gy vs. 49.3 ± 7.9 Gy for the bladder before and after applying kV-CBCT shifts.

Both UL and cancer have strong genetic components and we hypothesize that familial association between UL and cancer may be plausible. We thus assess familial risks between UL and cancer, hoping to find an explanation why UL may pose a risk of cancer. UL patients were identified from hospital inpatient and outpatient records and they were organized in families based on the Multigeneration Register into which also national cancer data were linked. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for cancer in the offspring generation when parents were diagnosed with UL, and conversely for UL when parents were diagnosed with cancer. Familial risks between UL and cancer were generally small and inconsistent providing no convincing support of genetic sharing between UL and cancer. However, bladder UL was associated weakly with prostate cancer, and ureter and bladder UL were associated with salivary gland cancer.

We present a novel machine learning (ML) method of processing automated performance metrics (APMs) to evaluate surgical performance and predict clinical outcomes after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Materials and methods:   We trained three ML algorithms utilizing APMs directly from robot system data (training material) and hospital length of stay (LOS; training label) (≤2 days and >2 days) from 78 RARP cases, and selected the algorithm with the best performance. The selected algorithm categorized the cases as ""Predicted as expected LOS (pExp-LOS)"" and ""Predicted as extended LOS (pExt-LOS)."" We compared postoperative outcomes of the two groups (Kruskal-Wallis/Fisher's exact tests). The algorithm then predicted individual clinical outcomes, which we compared with actual outcomes (Spearman's correlation/Fisher's exact tests). Finally, we identified five most relevant APMs adopted by the algorithm during predicting.  Results:   The ""Random Forest-50"" (RF-50) algorithm had the best performance, reaching 87.2% accuracy in predicting LOS (73 cases as ""pExp-LOS"" and 5 cases as ""pExt-LOS""). The ""pExp-LOS"" cases outperformed the ""pExt-LOS"" cases in surgery time (3.7 hours vs 4.6 hours, p = 0.007), LOS (2 days vs 4 days, p = 0.02), and Foley duration (9 days vs 14 days, p = 0.02). Patient outcomes predicted by the algorithm had significant association with the ""ground truth"" in surgery time (p < 0.001, r = 0.73), LOS (p = 0.05, r = 0.52), and Foley duration (p < 0.001, r = 0.45). The five most relevant APMs, adopted by the RF-50 algorithm in predicting, were largely related to camera manipulation.  Conclusion:   To our knowledge, ours is the first study to show that APMs and ML algorithms may help assess surgical RARP performance and predict clinical outcomes.

Green tea polyphenols have been associated with reducing inflammation and protection against carcinogenesis, especially in prostate cancer. While most of the research in this field, so far, has focussed on epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate only, we studied epicatechin-3-O-gallate, the second most abundant green tea polyphenol with essential therapeutic potential, to obtain a more detailed understanding of its anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory action. Furthermore, to improve the bioactivity of (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate, we synthesized a difluoro analogue, called (-)-5,7-difluoro-epicatechin-3-O-gallate. Both compounds reduced cell proliferation of human primary inflammatory lymphocytes in an apoptosis-specific fashion, while (-)-5,7-difluoro-epicatechin-3-O-gallate had a significantly higher activity compared to the natural product (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate. Treatment of low-metastatic LNCaP and high-metastatic PC-3 prostate cancer cells with (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate and (-)-5,7-difluoro-epicatechin-3-O-gallate demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability in the low micromolar range. These effects suggest that (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate and the more effective (-)-5,7-difluoro-epicatechin-3-O-gallate could be therapeutically used to inhibit tumorigenesis during initiation, promotion, and progression by diminishing the amount of inflammation due to a reduction of inflammatory lymphocytes.

It has been shown that sense-directed ncRNAs arising from the promoter region of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) mediate its repression. Here, we show that an antisense-directed ncRNA (paRCDH1-AS) transcribed from the CDH1 promoter is necessary for its expression. paRCDH1-AS acts as a hooking scaffold by recruiting the epigenetic regulators, UHRF1, DNMT3A, SUV39H1 and SUZ12, involved in CDH1 repression. The binding of epigenetic regulators to paCRDH1-AS, indeed, prevents their localization to the chromatin on CDH1 promoter. Moreover, paRCDH1-AS silencing induces CDH1 repression and a switch of the epigenetic profile on the promoter towards a more closed chromatin. Using bioinformatic and experimental approaches we defined that the promoter of the paRCDH1-AS is shared with the E-cadherin gene, showing a bidirectional promoter activity. We found that UHRF1 controls both CDH1 and paRCDH1-AS by directly binding this bidirectional promoter region.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to different microenvironmental conditions, such as the presence of highly metastatic PC-3M and highly invasive PC-3S prostate cancer cell lines, in addition to the angiogenic activator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), under normoxia. Untargeted high resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolomics revealed significant metabolite differences among the various conditions and a total of 25 significantly altered metabolites were identified including acetyl L-carnitine, NAD+, hypoxanthine, guanine and oleamide, with profile changes unique to each of the experimental conditions.

Recent clinical studies show favorable results for the PARP inhibitor olaparib used as single agent for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant PCa. Using 2D and 3D cell culture models mimicking the different treatment and progression stages of PCa, we evaluated a potential use for olaparib in combination with first-line endocrine treatments, androgen deprivation, and complete androgen blockade, and as a maintenance therapy following on from endocrine therapy. We demonstrate that the LNCaP cell line, possessing multiple aberrations in BRCAness genes, is sensitive to olaparib. Additive effects of olaparib combined with endocrine treatments in LNCaP are noted. In contrast, we find that the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive cell lines VCaP and DuCaP do not show signs of synthetic lethality, but are sensitive to cytotoxic effects caused by olaparib. In consequence, additive effects of olaparib with endocrine therapy were not observable in these cell lines, showing the need for synthetic lethality in combination treatment regimens. Additionally, we show that PCa cells remain sensitive to olaparib treatment after initial androgen deprivation implicating a possible use of olaparib as maintenance therapy.

Aberrant promoter hypermethylation of specific genes has been suggested as novel candidate biomarkers for PC that may improve diagnosis and prognosis. We here analyzed ST6GALNAC3 and ZNF660 promoter methylation in prostate tissues, and ST6GALNAC3, ZNF660, CCDC181, and HAPLN3 promoter methylation in liquid biopsies. First, using four independent patient sample sets, including a total of 110 nonmalignant (NM) and 705 PC tissue samples, analyzed by methylation-specific qPCR or methylation array, we found that hypermethylation of ST6GALNAC3 and ZNF660 was highly cancer-specific with areas under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of 0.917-0.995 and 0.846-0.903, respectively. Furthermore, ZNF660 hypermethylation was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence in two radical prostatectomy (RP) cohorts of 158 and 392 patients and remained significant also in the subsets of patients with Gleason score ≤7 (univariate Cox regression and log-rank tests, P < 0.05), suggesting that ZNF660 methylation analysis can potentially help to stratify low-/intermediate-grade PCs into indolent vs. more aggressive subtypes. Notably, ZNF660 hypermethylation was also significantly associated with poor overall and PC-specific survival in the RP cohort (n = 158) with long clinical follow-up available. Moreover, as proof of principle, we successfully detected highly PC-specific hypermethylated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for ST6GALNAC3, ZNF660, HAPLN3, and CCDC181 in liquid biopsies (serum) from 27 patients with PC vs. 10 patients with BPH, using droplet digital methylation-specific PCR analysis. Finally, we generated a three-gene (ST6GALNAC3/CCDC181/HAPLN3) ctDNA hypermethylation model, which detected PC with 100% specificity and 67% sensitivity. In conclusion, we here for the first time demonstrate diagnostic biomarker potential of ST6GALNAC3 and ZNF660 methylation, as well as prognostic biomarker potential of ZNF660. Furthermore, we show that hypermethylation of four genes can be detected in ctDNA in liquid biopsies (serum) from patients with PC.""","""['Christa Haldrup', 'Anne L Pedersen', 'Nadia Øgaard', 'Siri H Strand', 'Søren Høyer', 'Michael Borre', 'Torben F Ørntoft', 'Karina D Sørensen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['DNA methylation signatures for prediction of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Comprehensive Evaluation of TFF3 Promoter Hypomethylation and Molecular Biomarker Potential for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis.', 'Epigenetic silencing of MEIS2 in prostate cancer recurrence.', 'Prognostic DNA methylation markers for prostate cancer.', 'DNA Methylation-Based Testing in Liquid Biopsies as Detection and Prognostic Biomarkers for the Four Major Cancer Types.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.', 'Construction of a lipid metabolism-related and immune-associated prognostic score for gastric cancer.', 'Deciphering the Prognostic and Therapeutic Significance of Cell Cycle Regulator CENPF: A Potential Biomarker of Prognosis and Immune Microenvironment for Patients with Liposarcoma.', 'Liquid biopsy for monitoring of tumor dormancy and early detection of disease recurrence in solid tumors.', 'Sialyltransferases and Neuraminidases: Potential Targets for Cancer Treatment.']"""

The aim of the study was to compare concentrations of leptin, adiponectin and chemerin in patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia and to examine associations of the adipokines with the grade of prostate cancer, interleukin-6 (IL-6), insulin resistance and anthropometric and metabolic variables.  Material and methods:   The study group consisted of 140 men divided into two groups: I- prostate cancer (n=74) and II- with benign hyperplasia (n=66). Serum leptin, adiponectin, chemerin, IL-6 and metabolic profile were measured. Considering histological differentiation prostate cancer patients were divided into 3 subgroups: well differentiated (Gleason score ≤ 6), moderately differentiated subgroup (Gleason 7), and poorly differentiated (Gleason ≥8).  Results:   There were no differences between groups in BMI, waist circumference, HOMA-I, serum levels of total cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides, adiponectin, leptin and chemerin. However, the concentrations of PSA, leptin-to-adiponectin ratio and IL-6 were significantly higher in cancer group compared with benign hyperplasia group. In the poorly differentiated cancer subgroup, subjects had higher PSA, leptin, chemerin, IL-6 and triglycerides concentrations. Overweight and obese men with prostate cancer were more likely to have moderately or poorly differentiated cancer than those with normal BMI. In the all men serum adiponectin was significantly correlated with HOMA-I, BMI, glucose, triglycerides, cHDL. There were significant correlations between leptin and BMI, HOMA-I, waist, glucose, triglycerides and cHDL. Among all the participants we observed associations between chemerin and waist as well as triglycerides. In prostate cancer patients chemerin correlated with IL-6 and leptin. We measured significant positive correlations between Gleason score and chemerin and leptin concentrations. There was a positive correlation between adiponectin and PSA levels in all men, as well as in cancer group.

However, the nature of regulatory relationship between the PKD1 and MTA1, and its resulting impact on cancer metastasis remains unknown. Here we present evidence to establish that PKD1 is an upstream regulatory kinase of MTA1.  Methods:   Protein and mRNA expression of MTA1 in PKD1-overexpressing cells were determined using western blotting and reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR. Immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay (PLA) were used to determine the interaction between PKD1 and MTA1. PKD1-mediated nucleo-cytoplasmic export and polyubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation was determined using immunostaining. The correlation between PKD1 and MTA1 was determined using intra-tibial, subcutaneous xenograft, PTEN-knockout (PTEN-KO) and transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse models, as well as human cancer tissues.  Results:   We found that MTA1 is a PKD1-interacting substrate, and that PKD1 phosphorylates MTA1, supports its nucleus-to-cytoplasmic redistribution and utilises its N-terminal and kinase domains to effectively inhibit the levels of MTA1 via polyubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation. PKD1-mediated downregulation of MTA1 was accompanied by a significant suppression of prostate cancer progression and metastasis in physiologically relevant spontaneous tumour models. Accordingly, progression of human prostate tumours to increased invasiveness was also accompanied by decreased and increased levels of PKD1 and MTA1, respectively.

Objective:   We aim to investigate the biological role of long non-coding RNA FENDRR and its mechanism in PCa.  Materials and methods:   We determined the expression of FENDRR and miR-18a-5p in PCa tissues and examined the regulatory mechanism in PCa cell lines.  Results:   FENDRR transcripts in human PCa tissues were significantly decreased compared with the normal controls. Reduced expression of FENDRR was correlated with the increase of pathological degree and poor prognosis in PCa patients. Upregulation of FENDRR inhibited cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and decreased invasion and migration ability, which was inhibited by miR-18a-5p mimic. Knockdown of FENDRR resulted in a significant increase of PCa cell proliferation and decrease of apoptosis and this effect was inhibited miR-18a-5p inhibitor. FENDRR and RUNX1 contain potential target sites for miR-18a-5p. miR-18a-5p mimic inhibited RUNX1 expression and luciferase activity.

In vitro experiments with the dual capture system for capturing both LnCAP and LnCAP-EMT cells have shown significantly enhanced capture efficiency as compared to that of the EpCAM single capture system. Furthermore, the dual capture system could successfully identify CTCs in 20 out of 24 (83.3%) PCa patients, and the CTCs counts from the dual capture system were statistically correlated with the TNM stage of patients ( P < 0.05), while conventional diagnostic methods, such as serum PSA level and Gleason score, failed to correlate to patient TNM stages. To further explore potential clinical application of our dual capture system, captured CTCs were recovered and subjected to qRT-PCR to quantify known factors involved in PCa development and therapy. The results demonstrated that the combined detection of SChLAP1 and PSA in CTCs is a potential marker for identifying patients with metastatic PCa, while detection of AR and PD-L1 in CTCs may have the potential to determine the sensitivity of PCa patients to androgen deprivation therapy and immunotherapy, respectively. Taken together, the dual-antibody-functionalized microfluidic device established in our study overcomes the limitations of some CTC capture platforms that only detect epithelial or mesenchymal CTCs in PCa patients, and detection of the PCa-related RNA signatures from purified CTCs holds great promise to offer warnings for early metastasis of PCa and may provide guidance for therapy decisions.""","""['Changqing Yin', 'Yuhui Wang', 'Jia Ji', 'Bo Cai', 'Hao Chen', 'Zhonghua Yang', 'Kun Wang', 'Changliang Luo', 'Wuwen Zhang', 'Chunhui Yuan', 'Fubing Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Nanoroughened adhesion-based capture of circulating tumor cells with heterogeneous expression and metastatic characteristics.', 'Microtube device for selectin-mediated capture of viable circulating tumor cells from blood.', 'Selective isolation of magnetic nanoparticle-mediated heterogeneity subpopulation of circulating tumor cells using magnetic gradient based microfluidic system.', 'Microfluidic Devices for Circulating Tumor Cells Isolation and Subsequent Analysis.', 'The Discovery of Novel Circulating Cancer-Related Cells in Circulation Poses New Challenges to Microfluidic Devices for Enrichment and Detection.', 'Advances in early detection methods for solid tumors.', 'Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin-I-Based Magnetic Isolation for the Efficient and Specific Capture of SW480 Circulating Colorectal Tumor Cells.', 'Recent Advances in Microfluidic Platform for Physical and Immunological Detection and Capture of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Nanomaterial-Based Immunocapture Platforms for the Recognition, Isolation, and Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

Recognition that PSA testing has caused over diagnosis and over treatment of prostate cancer has generated considerable controversy over its value, and has spurred efforts to identify prognostic biomarkers to distinguish patients who need treatment from those that can be observed. Recent studies show that cancer is heterogeneous and forms a hierarchy of tumor cell populations. We developed a method of identifying prostate cancer differentiation states related to androgen signaling using Boolean logic. Using gene expression data, we identified two markers, CD38 and ARG2, that group prostate cancer into three differentiation states. Cancers with CD38-, ARG2- expression patterns, corresponding to an undifferentiated state, had significantly lower 10-year recurrence-free survival compared to the most differentiated group (CD38+ARG2+). We carried out immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for these two markers in a single institution (Stanford; n = 234) and multi-institution (Canary; n = 1326) cohorts. IHC staining for CD38 and ARG2 in the Stanford cohort demonstrated that combined expression of CD38 and ARG2 was prognostic. In the Canary cohort, low CD38 protein expression by IHC was significantly associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), extra-capsular extension (ECE) in univariable analysis.

To explore additional players that are regulated downstream of E6AP, we combined a transcriptomic and proteomic approach. We identified and quantified 16,130 transcripts and 7,209 proteins in castration resistant prostate cancer cell line, DU145. A total of 2,763 transcripts and 308 proteins were significantly altered on knockdown of E6AP. Pathway analyses supported the known phenotypic effects of E6AP knockdown in prostate cancer cells and in parallel exposed novel potential links of E6AP with cancer metabolism, DNA damage repair and immune response. Changes in expression of the top candidates were confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of these, clusterin, a stress-induced chaperone protein, commonly deregulated in prostate cancer, was pursued further. Knockdown of E6AP resulted in increased clusterin transcript and protein levels in vitro and in vivo Concomitant knockdown of E6AP and clusterin supported the contribution of clusterin to the phenotype induced by E6AP.

A phase III trial showed that VTP significantly reduced disease progression when compared with active surveillance in patients with low-risk prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to identify a druggable pathway that could be combined with VTP to improve its efficacy and applicability to higher risk prostate cancer tumors.Experimental Design: Transcriptome analysis of VTP-treated tumors (LNCaP-AR xenografts) was used to identify a candidate pathway for combination therapy. The efficacy of the combination therapy was assessed in mice bearing LNCaP-AR or VCaP tumors.Results: Gene set enrichment analysis identifies the enrichment of androgen-responsive gene sets within hours after VTP treatment, suggesting that the androgen receptor (AR) may be a viable target in combination with VTP. We tested this hypothesis in mice bearing LNCaP-AR xenograft tumors by using androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), degarelix, in combination with VTP. Compared with either ADT or VTP alone, a single dose of degarelix in concert with VTP significantly inhibited tumor growth. A sharp decline in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) confirmed AR inhibition in this group. Tumors treated by VTP and degarelix displayed intense terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining 7 days after treatment, supporting an increased apoptotic frequency underlying the effect on tumor inhibition.Conclusions: Improvement of local tumor control following androgen deprivation combined with VTP provides the rationale and preliminary protocol parameters for clinical trials in patients presented with locally advanced prostate cancer.

The objective of this study was to report biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS), metastatic-free survival (MFS) and PCa-specific mortality after low-dose brachytherapy, stratified according to the D'Amico risk classification in a large Danish cohort.  Materials and methods:   The study population comprised 502 men treated with brachytherapy in 1998-2012. BRFS was defined by the Phoenix criteria. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate BRFS and MFS. The cumulative PCa mortality was analysed using competing risk analyses. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to estimate risk of biochemical recurrence.  Results:   In total, 206 men were classified with low-risk PCa, 265 men with intermediate-risk PCa and 33 men with high-risk PCa. Median follow-up was 6.6 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.2-7.0]. The 10 year BRFS was 90% (95% CI 83-97), 75% (95% CI 65-87) and 75% (95% CI 59-92) in men with low-, intermediate- and high-risk PCa, respectively.

Numerous factors contribute to this phenomenon including the recently-reported ESR1 gene mutations such as Y537S, which amplifies co-activator interactions with ERα and promotes constitutive activation of ERα function. Herein, we propose that direct targeting of the activation function-2 (AF2) site on ERα represents a promising alternative therapeutic strategy to overcome mutation-driven resistance in breast cancer. A systematic computer-guided drug discovery approach was employed to develop a potent ERα inhibitor that was extensively evaluated by a series of experiments to confirm its AF2-specific activity. We demonstrate that the developed small-molecule inhibitor effectively prevents ERα-coactivator interactions and exhibits a strong anti-proliferative effect against tamoxifen-resistant cells, as well as downregulates ERα-dependent genes and effectively diminishes the receptor binding to chromatin. Notably, the identified lead compound successfully inhibits known constitutively-active, resistance-associated mutant forms of ERα observed in clinical settings. Overall, this study reports the development of a novel class of ERα AF2 inhibitors, which have the potential to effectively inhibit ERα activity by a unique mechanism and to circumvent the issue of mutation-driven resistance in breast cancer.""","""['Kriti Singh', 'Ravi S N Munuganti', 'Nada Lallous', 'Kush Dalal', 'Ji Soo Yoon', 'Aishwariya Sharma', 'Takeshi Yamazaki', 'Artem Cherkasov', 'Paul S Rennie']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Computer-Aided Ligand Discovery for Estrogen Receptor Alpha.', 'In silico discovery and validation of potent small-molecule inhibitors targeting the activation function 2 site of human oestrogen receptor α.', 'Mutation site and context dependent effects of ESR1 mutation in genome-edited breast cancer cell models.', 'Loss of Estrogen-Regulated MIR135A1 at 3p21.1 Promotes Tamoxifen Resistance in Breast Cancer.', 'The association between type of endocrine therapy and development of estrogen receptor-1 mutation(s) in patients with hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and non-randomized trials.', 'A Closer Look at Estrogen Receptor Mutations in Breast Cancer and Their Implications for Estrogen and Antiestrogen Responses.', 'Chemical Screening of Nuclear Receptor Modulators.', 'Computer-Aided Ligand Discovery for Estrogen Receptor Alpha.', 'Allosteric Binding Sites On Nuclear Receptors: Focus On Drug Efficacy and Selectivity.', 'Steroid receptor/coactivator binding inhibitors: An update.']"""

Although previous studies have suggested that antimony may have the function as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene in several cancers, the molecular basis underlying antimony-mediated transformation is still unclear. In the current study, we attempt to elucidate the potential role of antimony in the development of prostate cancer. Our results showed that the concentration of antimony was much higher in serum of prostate cancer patients, and was closely associated with poor outcome of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Additionally, low dose of antimony could promote proliferation and invasion of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP cells in vitro and in vivo. The mechanistic studies demonstrated that exposure to antimony triggered the phosphorylation of androgen receptor (AR), which transcriptionally regulates the expression of androgen-related targets, including PSA and NKX3.1. Overall, our results unearthed that antimony could promote tumor growth by mimicking androgen activity in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. Therefore, these findings expanded our understanding on the molecular mechanism of antimony in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of prostate cancer, and it appears to be an inspiring strategy to restrain prostate cancer by inhibiting antimony-induced androgen-like effects.""","""['Changwen Zhang', 'Penghao Li', 'Yingwu Wen', 'Guowei Feng', 'Yu Liu', 'Yangyi Zhang', 'Yong Xu', 'Zhihong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Toxicol Lett""","""['Role of androgen receptor in the progression of human prostate tumor cells to androgen independence and insensitivity.', 'Antimony enhances c-Myc stability in prostate cancer via activating CtBP2-ROCK1 signaling pathway.', 'Gum mastic inhibits the expression and function of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen-dependent regulation of Her-2/neu in prostate cancer cells.', 'Zyflamend inhibits the expression and function of androgen receptor and acts synergistically with bicalutimide to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Population-Level Patterns of Prostate Cancer Occurrence: Disparities in Virginia.', 'Exploring the Pharmacological Mechanisms of Xihuang Pills Against Prostate Cancer via Integrating Network Pharmacology and Experimental Validation In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'Risk of Cancer for Workers Exposed to Antimony Compounds: A Systematic Review.', 'Reduced pim-1 expression increases chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in human androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by inducing apoptosis.']"""

We hypothesize p66Shc also increases the migratory activity of PCa cells through ROS and investigate the associated mechanism. Using the transwell assay, our study reveals that the level of p66Shc protein correlates with cell migratory ability across several PCa cell lines. Furthermore, we show hydrogen peroxide treatment induces migration of PCa cells that express low levels of p66Shc in a dose-dependent manner, while antioxidants inhibit migration. Conversely, PCa cells that express high levels of endogenous p66Shc or by cDNA transfection possess increased cell migration which is mitigated upon p66Shc shRNA transfection or expression of oxidase-deficient dominant-negative p66Shc W134F mutant. Protein microarray and immunoblot analyses reveal multiple proteins, including ErbB-2, AKT, mTOR, ERK, FOXM1, PYK2 and Rac1, are activated in p66Shc-elevated cells. Their involvement in PCa migration was examined using respective small-molecule inhibitors. The role of Rac1 was further validated using cDNA transfection and, significantly, p66Shc is found to promote lamellipodia formation through Rac1 activation.

In this study, we (1) compared characteristics and diagnoses between CPs and NCPs who visited the ED in a cancer center or general hospital; (2) compared characteristics and diagnoses between CPs and NCPs who were hospitalized via the ED in a cancer center or general hospital; and (3) investigated important factors associated with such hospitalization.  Methods and findings:   We analyzed patient characteristic and diagnosis [based on International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) codes] data from the ED of a comprehensive cancer center (MDACC), 24 general EDs in Harris County, Texas (HCED), and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 1/1/2007-12/31/2009. Approximately 3.4 million ED visits were analyzed: 47,245, 3,248,973, and 104,566 visits for MDACC, HCED, and NHAMCS, respectively, of which 44,143 (93.4%), 44,583 (1.4%), and 632 (0.6%) were CP visits. CPs were older than NCPs and stayed longer in EDs. Lung, gastrointestinal (excluding colorectal), and genitourinary (excluding prostate) cancers were the three most common diagnoses related to ED visits at general EDs. CPs visiting MDACC were more likely than CPs visiting HCED to be privately insured. CPs were more likely than NCPs to be hospitalized. Pneumonia and influenza, fluid and electrolyte disorders, and fever were important predictive factors for CP hospitalization; coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and heart failure were important factors for NCP hospitalization.

Subjects and methods:   Our study population comprised 100 treatment-adherent men without prostate cancer assigned to dutasteride or placebo in the REDUCE trial, who had slides available from mandatory year-4 biopsies. Half of the men also provided slides from a year-2 biopsy. We obtained 20× whole-slide images and used specialized software to generate a library of 1 300 epithelial and stromal features from objects comprising superpixels and several types of nuclei, including spatial relations among objects between and within each hierarchical level. We used penalized logistic regression and fivefold cross-validation to find optimal combinations of histological features in the year-4 biopsies. Feature data from the year-2 biopsies were fitted to a final model for independent validation. Two pathologists, blinded to treatment, scored each image for focal atrophy and histological features previously linked to 5AR1 treatment.  Results:   Consensus classification by pathologists obtained a discrimination accuracy equivalent to chance. A 21-feature computer vision model gave a cross-validation area under the curve of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-0.99) in the year-4 biopsies and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.65-0.92) in the set-aside year-2 biopsies. Histology scores were not correlated with change in prostate-specific antigen level, serum dihydrotestosterone level or gland volume. Key features associated with dutasteride treatment included greater shape and colour uniformity in stroma, irregular clustering of epithelial nuclei, and greater variation in lumen shape.  Conclusion:   The present findings show that a computer vision approach can detect subtle histological effects attributable to dutasteride, resulting in a continuous measure of responsiveness to the drug that could eventually be used to predict individual patient response in the context of BPH treatment or cancer chemoprevention.""","""['Amit Sethi', 'Lingdao Sha', 'Neeraj Kumar', 'Virgilia Macias', 'Ryan J Deaton', 'Peter H Gann']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Effect of dutasteride on prostate biopsy rates and the diagnosis of prostate cancer in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and enlarged prostates in the Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin trial.', 'Obesity is associated with increased prostate growth and attenuated prostate volume reduction by dutasteride.', 'Efficacy and safety of dutasteride in the four-year treatment of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', '5-α-Reductase inhibitors for prostate cancer chemoprevention: an updated Cochrane systematic review.', 'Dutasteride for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.']"""

By addressing treatment modality, where participant numbers were sufficient, we also sought to explore whether gay (homosexual) men diagnosed with PCa (PCaDx) and with a primary treatment modality of surgery would report differences in body image and self-esteem compared with straight (heterosexual) men with PCaDx with a primary treatment modality of surgery, compared with gay and straight men without PCaDx.

We have investigated the impact of laparoscopic and robotic total mesorectal excision (TME) on QoL and functional outcomes.  Method:   Patients undergoing laparoscopic or robotic TME for rectal cancer between 2009 and 2013 were prospectively included in this questionnaire-based survey of QoL together with variations in urinary and sexual function. A propensity score analysis was retrospectively conducted to compare outcomes between groups in a cohort matched 1:1 for age, sex, body mass index, preoperative chemoradiation status and tumour height. The survey was performed preoperatively and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.  Results:   Global health status/QoL was similar between the two groups for 130 matched pairs, but the robotic group showed better role, emotional and social functioning and experienced less fatigue and financial difficulty. International Prostatic Symptom Scores in men increased postoperatively, with significantly less impairment in the robotic group at 6 months. These scores were comparable to preoperative scores at 6 months in the robotic group and at 12 months in the laparoscopic group. Of 48 sexually active men in each group, International Index of Erectile Function-5 scores decreased postoperatively, returning to preoperative levels at 6 months in the robotic group and at 12 months in the laparoscopic groups.

The 4Kscore is currently restricted to patients who have not had a digital rectal exam (DRE) in the previous 96 h, owing to prior mixed data suggesting that prostate specific antigen (PSA) isoforms may increase by a statistically significant-if not necessarily clinically significant-amount shortly after DRE. Our primary objective was to determine if 4Kscore test results are affected by a preceding DRE.  Methods:   Participants at a Prostate Cancer Awareness Week screening event sponsored by the Prostate Conditions Education Council filled out clinical history questionnaires and had blood samples for 4Kscore testing drawn prior to DRE, then 15-45 min following DRE. Patients with prior cancer diagnosis, 5-alpha reductase inhibitor medication use, or lower urinary tract procedures in the prior 6 months were excluded, resulting in a population of 162 participants for analysis. Values were then compared to determine if there was a significant difference in 4Kscore following DRE.  Results:   A statistically significant increase was seen in levels of 3 kallikreins measured (total PSA, free PSA, and intact PSA; median <0.03 ng/mL for all). This resulted in a small but statistically significant decrease in post-DRE 4Kscore (median absolute score decrease 0.43%).

Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End results (SEER) database (2004-2014), we identified patients with D'Amico intermediate- or high-risk characteristics who underwent RP with PLND, without evidence of LNI. First, multivariable logistic regression models tested for predictors of more extensive PLND, defined as removed lymph node count (NRN) ≥75th percentile. Second, Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox regression models tested the effect of NRN ≥75th percentile on CSM. Finally, survival analyses were repeated using continuously coded NRN.  Results:   In 28 147 RP and PLND patients without LNI, 67.3% versus 32.7% exhibited D'Amico intermediate- or high-risk characteristics. The median NRN was 6 (IQR 3-10), the 75th percentile defined patients with NRN ≥11. Patients with NRN ≥11 had higher rate of cT2/3 stage (29.8 vs 26.1%), GS ≥8 (25.7 vs 22.4%), and respectively more frequently exhibited D'Amico high-risk characteristics (34.6 vs 32.1%). In multivariable logistic regression models predicting the probability of more extensive PLND (NRN ≥11), higher biopsy GS, higher cT stage, higher PSA, more recent year of diagnosis, and younger age at diagnosis represented independent predictors. At 72 months after RP, CSM-free rates were 99.5 versus 98.1% for NRN ≥11 and NRN ≤10, respectively and resulted in a HR of 0.50 (P = 0.01), after adjustment for all covariates. Similarly, continuously coded NRN achieved independent predictor status (HR: 0.955, P = 0.01), where each additional removed lymph node reduced CSM risk by 4.5%.  Conclusion:   More extensive PLND at RP provides improved staging information and consequently is associated with lower CSM in D'Amico intermediate- and high-risk PCa patients without evidence of LNI. Hence, more extensive PLND should be recommended in such individuals.""","""['Felix Preisser', 'Marco Bandini', 'Michele Marchioni', 'Sebastiano Nazzani', 'Zhe Tian', 'Raisa S Pompe', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Fred Saad', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen', 'Derya Tilki', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Reply to the letter to the editor: RE: Preisser F, et al.

Design:   Retrospective cohort study.  Setting:   Nationwide discharge database of acute care hospitals in Japan.  Participants:   Individuals aged 65 and older diagnosed with one of the 30 most common diagnoses and discharged from 987 hospitals between April 2014 and September 2015 (N = 1,834,378).  Measurements:   The primary outcome was unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days. Poisson generalized estimating equation models were fitted to assess the risks of readmission for individuals with and without dementia, using primary diagnosis as a possible effect modifier and clinical factors as potential confounders.  Results:   The overall prevalence of dementia was 14.7% and varied according to primary diagnosis, ranging from 3.0% in individuals with prostate cancer to 69.4% in those with aspiration pneumonia. Overall, individuals with dementia had a higher risk of hospital readmission (8.3%) than those without (4.1%) (adjusted risk ratio (aRR])=1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.44-1.49), although diagnostic category substantially modified the relationship between dementia and hospital readmission. For hip fracture, dementia was associated with greater risk of hospital readmission (adjusted risk 11.5% vs 7.9%; aRR=1.46; 95% CI=1.28-1.68); this risk was attenuated for cholecystitis (adjusted risk 12.8% vs 12.4%; aRR=1.03; 95% CI=0.90-1.18).

Materials and methods:   In our study, the prostate and any radiological findings within were segmented retrospectively on 3D T2-weighted MR images of 266 subjects who underwent radical prostatectomy. Subsequent histopathological analysis determined both the ground truth and the Gleason grade of the tumors. A randomly chosen subset of 19 subjects was used to generate a multi-subject-derived prostate template. Subsequently, a cascading registration algorithm involving both affine and non-rigid B-spline transforms was used to register the prostate of every subject to the template. Corresponding transformation of radiological findings yielded a population-based probabilistic model of tumor occurrence. The quality of our probabilistic model building approach was statistically evaluated by measuring the proportion of correct placements of tumors in the prostate template, i.e., the number of tumors that maintained their anatomical location within the prostate after their transformation into the prostate template space.  Results:   Probabilistic model built with tumors deemed clinically significant demonstrated a heterogeneous distribution of tumors, with higher likelihood of tumor occurrence at the mid-gland anterior transition zone and the base-to-mid-gland posterior peripheral zones.

Among the available PET radiotracers, the low molecular weight agents that bind to PSMA are proving particularly effective. We present the dosimetry results for 18F-DCFPyL in nine patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   Nine patients were imaged using sequential PET/CT scans at approximately 1, 12, 35 and 70 min, and a final PET/CT scan at approximately 120 min after intravenous administration of 321 ± 8 MBq (8.7 ± 0.2 mCi) of18F-DCFPyL. Time-integrated-activity coefficients were calculated and used as input in OLINDA/EXM software to obtain dose estimates for the majority of the major organs. The absorbed doses (AD) to the eye lens and lacrimal glands were calculated using Monte-Carlo models based on idealized anatomy combined with patient-specific volumes and activity from the PET/CT scans. Monte-Carlo based models were also developed for calculation of the dose to two major salivary glands (parotid and submandibular) using CT-based patient-specific gland volumes.  Results:   The highest calculated mean AD per unit administered activity of 18F was found in the lacrimal glands, followed by the submandibular glands, kidneys, urinary bladder wall, and parotid glands. The S-values for the lacrimal glands to the eye lens (0.42 mGy/MBq h), the tear film to the eye lens (1.78 mGy/MBq h) and the lacrimal gland self-dose (574.10 mGy/MBq h) were calculated. Average S-values for the salivary glands were 3.58 mGy/MBq h for the parotid self-dose and 6.78 mGy/MBq h for the submandibular self-dose. The resultant mean effective dose of 18F-DCFPyL was 0.017 ± 0.002 mSv/MBq.

It is know that [68Ga]PSMA 11 ([68Ga]Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC) is the most well studied PET imaging agent for detecting over expressed PSMA binding sites of tumors in humans. In an effort to provide new agents with improved characteristics for PET imaging, we report a novel [68Ga]-Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys(Ahx)-linker-HBED-CC conjugate with a novel O-(carboxymethyl)-L-tyrosine, as the linker group.  Methods:   Radiosynthesis was performed by a direct method. In vitro binding and cell internalization of [68Ga]10 was investigated in PSMA positive LNCaP cell lines. Biodistribution and MicroPET imaging studies were performed in LNCaP tumor bearing mice.  Results:   In vitro binding to LNCaP cells showed that natGa labeled O-(carboxymethyl)-L-tyrosine conjugate, [natGa]10, displayed excellent affinity and specificity (IC50 = 16.5 nM) a value comparable to that of PSMA 11. In vitro cell binding and internalization showed excellent uptake and retention; [68Ga]10 displayed significantly higher cellular internalization than [68Ga]PSMA 11 (12.5 vs 7.4% ID/106 cells at 1 h). Biodistribution studies in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice exhibited a high specific uptake in PSMA expressing tumors and fast clearance in normal organs (19.7 tumor/blood; 20.7 tumor/muscle at 1 h after iv injection). MicroPET imaging studies in mice confirmed that [68Ga]10 displayed excellent uptake and distinctive tumor localization, which was blocked by iv injection of a competing drug, 2-PMPA.  Conclusions:   The preliminary results strongly suggest that [68Ga]10 may be promising candidates as a PET imaging radiotracer for detecting PSMA expression in prostate cancer.""","""['Zhihao Zha', 'Karl Ploessl', 'Seok Rye Choi', 'Zehui Wu', 'Lin Zhu', 'Hank F Kung']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['68Ga-complex lipophilicity and the targeting property of a urea-based PSMA inhibitor for PET imaging.', 'Synthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of a new class of high-affinity 18F-labeled PSMA ligands for detection of prostate cancer by PET imaging.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of copper-64 radiolabeled DUPA-6-Ahx-(NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2, a novel bivalent targeting vector having affinity for two distinct biomarkers (GRPr/PSMA) of prostate cancer.', 'Current use of PSMA-PET in prostate cancer management.', 'Synthesis of 68Ga-radiopharmaceuticals using both generator-derived and cyclotron-produced 68Ga as exemplified by 68GaGa-PSMA-11 for prostate cancer PET imaging.', 'N-Alkyl Carbamoylimidazoles as Versatile Synthons for the Synthesis of Urea-Based PSMA Inhibitors.', 'A prospective head-to-head comparison of 68GaGa-P16-093 and 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in patients with primary prostate cancer.', 'Modern Developments in Bifunctional Chelator Design for Gallium Radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Head-to-head comparison of 68GaGa-P16-093 and 2-18FFDG PET/CT in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma: a pilot study.', 'Optimized 68Ga-Labeled Urea-Based PSMA-Targeted PET Tracers for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) data from the Medical Research Council RT01 radiotherapy with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy trial of 843 patients were used. PROs were collected over 5 years with the University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) and the 36 item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). Symptom clusters were explored using hierarchical cluster analysis. The association of treatment dose, baseline patient characteristics and early symptom clusters with the change in severity of PROs over 3 years was investigated with multivariate linear mixed effects models.  Results:   Seven symptom clusters of three or more symptoms were identified. The clusters were stable over time. The longitudinal profiles of symptom clusters showed the onset of acute symptoms during treatment for all symptom clusters and significant recovery by 6 months. Some clusters, such as physical health and sexual function, were adversely affected more than others by androgen deprivation therapy, and were less likely to return to pretreatment levels over time. Older age was significantly associated with decreased long-term physical function, physical health and sexual function (P < 0.001). Both baseline and acute symptom clusters were significant antecedents for impaired function and health-related quality of life at 3 years.  Conclusions:   Men with poorer physical function and health before or during treatment were more likely to report poorer PROs at year 3. Early assessment using PROs and lifestyle interventions should be used to identify those with higher needs and provide targeted rehabilitation and symptom management.""","""['A Lemanska', 'D P Dearnaley', 'R Jena', 'M R Sydes', 'S Faithfull']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Symptom clusters for revising scale membership in the analysis of prostate cancer patient reported outcome measures: a secondary data analysis of the Medical Research Council RT01 trial (ISCRTN47772397).', 'Disease-specific and general health-related quality of life in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients: the Pros-IT CNR study.', 'Hypofractionated radiotherapy versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer: 2-year patient-reported outcomes of the randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 CHHiP trial.', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.', 'Acute and Late Adverse Events Associated With Radical Radiation Therapy Prostate Cancer Treatment: A Systematic Review of Clinician and Patient Toxicity Reporting in Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'Symptom burden profiles in men with advanced prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Graphene-based biosensors for the detection of prostate cancer protein biomarkers: a review.']"""

The aim of the study was to translate and validate a German version of the EPIC with cultural adaptation to the different German speaking countries and to establish the MID.  Methods:   We translated and culturally adapted the EPIC into German. For validation, we included a consecutive subsample of 92 patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy who participated the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Cohort. Baseline and follow-up assessments took place before and six weeks after prostatectomy in 2010 and 2011. We assessed the EPIC, EORTC QLQ-PR25, Feeling Thermometer, SF-36 and a global rating of health state change variable. We calculated the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct validity, responsiveness and MID.  Results:   For most EPIC domains and subscales, our a priori defined criteria for reliability were fulfilled (construct reliability: Cronbach's alpha 0.7-0.9; test-retest reliability: intraclass-correlation coefficient ≥ 0.7). Cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations between EPIC and EORTC QLQ-PR25 domains ranged from 0.14-0.79, and 0.06-0.5 and 0.08-0.72 for Feeling Thermometer and SF-36, respectively. We established MID values of 10, 4, 12, and 6 for the urinary, bowel, sexual and hormonal domain.  Conclusion:   The German version of the EPIC is reliable, responsive and valid to measure HRQL in prostate cancer patients and is now available in German language. With the suggested MID we provide interpretation to what extent changes in HRQL are clinically relevant for patients.

The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain C-7 displayed 99% sequence similarity with different Streptomyces species. The highest score was displayed for Streptomyces sp. strain Chy2-8 followed by Streptomyces violarus strain NBRC13104 and Streptomyces arenae strain ISP5293. The position of C-7 in the phylogenetic tree suggested uniqueness of the strain.

However, the effects of GRh2 on prostate cancer (PC) cell growth remain unknown, and were, thus, addressed in the present study.  Materials and methods:   PC3 and DU145 PC cell lines were exposed to GRh2. Cell proliferation was assessed in an MTT assay and by BrdU incorporation. Apoptosis of the cells were assessed by TUNEL staining. Total RNA was assessed by RT-qPCR. Protein levels were assessed by Western blotting. Bioinformatics and dual luciferase reporter assay were applied to determine the functional binding of miRNA to mRNA of target gene.  Results:   GRh2 dose-dependently decreased PC cell proliferation, but did not alter cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, GRh2 dose-dependently increased the protein, but not mRNA of a cell-cycle suppressor CDKN1A in PC cells, suggesting the presence of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated protein translation control of CDKN1A by GRh2. In all candidate miRNAs that bind to 3'-UTR of CDKN1A, miR-4295 was specifically found to be suppressed dose-dependently by GRh2 in PC cells. Moreover, miR-4295 bound CDKN1A to suppress its protein translation. Furthermore, cell proliferation in PC cells that overexpressed miR-4295 did not alter in response to GRh2.

The complex etiology is attributed to many factors like heredity, cirrhosis, hepatitis infections or the dysregulation of the different molecular pathways. Nevertheless, the current treatment regimens have either severe side effects or tumors gradually acquire resistance upon prolonged use. Thus, developing a new selective treatment for HCC is the need of the hour. Many anticancer agents derived from plants have been evaluated for their cytotoxicity towards many human cancer cell lines. Strigolactones (SLs)-a newly discovered class of phytohormones, play a crucial role in the development of plant-root and shoot. Recently, many synthetic analogues of SLs have demonstrated pro-apoptotic effects on different cancer cell lines like prostate, breast, colon and lung. In this study, we tested synthetic SLs analogues on HCC cell line-HepG2 and evaluated their capability to induce cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. Primary WST-1 assays, followed by annexin-V/7AAD staining, demonstrated the anti-proliferative effects. The SLs analogues TIT3 and TIT7 were found to significantly reduce HepG2 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner and induce apoptosis. Interestingly, though TIT3 and TIT7 strongly affected cancer cell proliferation, both compounds showed moderate anti-proliferative effect on normal cells. Further, migration of cancer cells was suppressed upon treatment with TIT3 and TIT7 in a wound healing assay. In summary, these findings suggest that two SLs analogues TIT3 and TIT7 exert selective inhibitory effects on cancer cells most likely through targeting microtubules.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective database analysis of 217 patients with secondary tumors of the GI tract. Endoscopic findings and histologic diagnoses were systematically re-evaluated.  Results:   Malignant melanoma (n = 33, 15%), breast cancer (n = 32, 15%), and pancreatic cancer (n = 27, 12%) were the most common corresponding primaries.

The median time between the diagnoses of primary and secondary tumors was 19 months (mean, 31; range, 0-251), and this time was particularly long for renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer (median, 38 and 45 months, respectively). Direct invasion from extra-GI malignancies was more common (56%) than vascular cancer spread (44%) and depended on both sites of tumor involvement and corresponding primary. The lesions presented with various endoscopic patterns. In patients for whom a definitive diagnosis of cancer was known before the examination (n = 168), a secondary tumor was included in the differential diagnosis in only 48% of lesions. It is of note that the remaining cases were diagnosed endoscopically as primary tumors and rarely also as nonneoplastic change.  Conclusions:   Secondary tumors may affect all parts of the GI tract.

Evaluating multimodality registrations using these spatial intensity distributions is also complicated by the fact that these metrics are often employed in the registration optimization process. This work evaluates rigid and deformable image registrations of the prostate in between diagnostic-MRI and radiation treatment planning-CT by utilizing a planning-MRI after fiducial marker placement as a surrogate. The surrogate allows for the direct quantitative analysis that can be difficult in the multimodality domain.  Methods:   For thirteen prostate patients, T2 images were acquired at two different time points, the first several weeks prior to planning (diagnostic-MRI) and the second on the same day as the planning-CT (planning-MRI). The diagnostic-MRI was deformed to the planning-CT utilizing a commercially available algorithm which synthesizes a deformable image registration (DIR) algorithm from local rigid registrations. The planning-MRI provided an independent surrogate for the planning-CT for assessing registration accuracy using image similarity metrics, including Pearson correlation and normalized mutual information (NMI). A local analysis was performed by looking only within the prostate, proximal seminal vesicles, penile bulb, and combined areas.  Results:   The planning-MRI provided an excellent surrogate for the planning-CT with residual error in fiducial alignment between the two datasets being submillimeter, 0.78 mm. DIR was superior to the rigid registration in 11 of 13 cases demonstrating a 27.37% improvement in NMI (P < 0.009) within a regional area surrounding the prostate and associated critical organs. Pearson correlations showed similar results, demonstrating a 13.02% improvement (P < 0.013).  Conclusion:   By utilizing the planning-MRI as a surrogate for the planning-CT, an independent evaluation of registration accuracy is possible. This population provides an ideal testing ground for MRI to CT DIR by obviating the need for multimodality comparisons which are inherently more challenging.""","""['Kyle R Padgett', 'Radka Stoyanova', 'Sara Pirozzi', 'Perry Johnson', 'Jon Piper', 'Nesrin Dogan', 'Alan Pollack']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Evaluation of the accuracy of deformable image registration on MRI with a physical phantom.', 'Structure guided deformable image registration for treatment planning CT and post stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) Primovist® (Gd-EOB-DTPA) enhanced MRI.', 'Using C-Arm X-ray images from marker insertion to confirm the gold fiducial marker identification in an MRI-only prostate radiotherapy workflow.', 'Evaluation of DIR algorithm performance in real patients for radiotherapy treatments: A systematic review of operator-dependent strategies.', 'Roles of Deformable Image Registration in adaptive RT: From contour propagation to dose monitoring.', 'Automatic contouring using deformable image registration for tandem-ring or tandem-ovoid brachytherapy.']"""

Linsitinib is a small molecule and potent dual inhibitor of IGF-1R and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. We report results of a single-arm, phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of linsitinib in men with chemotherapy-naïve asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods Patients received at 150 mg orally twice daily on a 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was prostate specific (PSA) response at 12 weeks and correlative studies included circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs). Results Seventeen patients, median age 68 (55-78) and pre-treatment PSA of 55.23 (2.46-277.60) were enrolled and completed 12 weeks of therapy. All but two patients discontinued therapy secondary to PSA progression, which met the predefined futility criteria and led to early termination of this study. Overall best response (RECIST v1.1) included a partial response in 1 patient and stable disease in 8 patients. Higher baseline CTCs were associated with higher pre-treatment PSA levels (Spearman r = 0.49, p = 0.04) but no correlation between PSA progression and CTCs/CECs were observed. Most common adverse events included fatigue, nausea/vomiting, AST/ALT changes and prolonged QT interval. Conclusions Single-agent linsitinib was safe and well tolerated but failed to show activity in men with mCRPC.

We also examined, for the first time the feasibility of tracer production using a PSMA-11 sterile cold-kit in the clinical workflow of PET/CT centres.  Methods:   Fifty prostate cancer patients (25 staging, 25 biochemical recurrence) were enrolled in this study. All patients received an intravenous dose of 2.0 MBq/kg body weight 68Ga-PSMA-11 prepared using a sterile cold kit (ANMI SA, Liege, Belgium), followed by an early (20 min after injection) semi-whole-body PET/CT scan and a standard-delay (100 min after injection) abdominopelvic PET/CT scan. The detection rates with 68Ga-PSMA-11 were compared between the two acquisitions. The pattern of physiological background activity and tumour to background ratio were also analysed.  Results:   The total preparation time was reduced to 5 min using the PSMA-11 sterile cold kit, which improved the final radionuclide activity by about 30% per single 68Ge/68Ga generator elution. Overall, 158 pathological lesions were analysed in 45 patients (90%) suggestive of malignancy on both (early and standard-delay) 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT images. There was a significant (p < 0.001) increase in SUVmax on delayed images in suspicious prostates (11.6 ± 8.2 to 14.8 ± 1.0) and lymph nodes (LNs; 9.7 ± 5.9 to 12.3 ± 8.8), while bone lesions showed no significant increase (8.5 ± 5.6 to 9.2 ± 7.0, p = 0.188). However, the SUVmax of suspicious lesions on early images was adequate to support the criteria for correct interpretation (mean SUVmax 9.83 ± 6.7).In 26 of 157 lesions, but a decrease in SUV was seen, mostly in subcentimetre lesions in patients with multiple metastases. However, it did not affect the staging of the disease or patient management. The tumour to background ratio of primary prostate lesions and LNs showed a significant (p < 0.001) increase from the early to the standard-delay acquisition, but no significant increase was seen in bony lesions (p = 0.11).  Conclusion:   The PSMA-11 sterile cold kit seems to be feasible for use in routine clinical practice, and it has a shorter radionuclide preparation time and is less operator-dependent than the synthesizer-based production method. In addition, early 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging seems to provide a detection rate comparable with that of standard-delay imaging. Furthermore, the shorter preparation time using the 68Ga-PSMA-11 sterile cold kit and promising value of early PET/CT scanning could allow tailoring of imaging protocols which may reduce the costs and improve the time efficiency in PET/CT centres.""","""['Mohsen Beheshti', 'Zeinab Paymani', 'Joana Brilhante', 'Hans Geinitz', 'Daniela Gehring', 'Thomas Leopoldseder', 'Ludovic Wouters', 'Christian Pirich', 'Wolfgang Loidl', 'Werner Langsteger']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Early PET imaging with 68Ga-PSMA-11 increases the detection rate of local recurrence in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence.', 'Early dynamic imaging in 68Ga- PSMA-11 PET/CT allows discrimination of urinary bladder activity and prostate cancer lesions.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography in the management of recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Combined forced diuresis and late acquisition on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT for biochemical recurrent prostate cancer: a clinical practice-oriented study.', 'Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer after Primary Treatment with Curative Intent-Impact of Delayed Imaging.', 'Cold Kit Labeling: The Future of 68Ga Radiopharmaceuticals?', 'Intracellular vesicle entrapment of nanobubble ultrasound contrast agents targeted to PSMA promotes prolonged enhancement and stability in vivo and in vitro.', 'Photodynamic Therapy: Targeting Cancer Biomarkers for the Treatment of Cancers.']"""

Objective:   To define the overall survival (OS) of aggregate data of patient subgroups from the CHAARTED and GETUG-AFU15 studies, defined by metastatic burden (HV and LV) and time of metastasis occurrence (at diagnosis or after prior local treatment [PRLT]).  Design, setting, and participants:   Data were accessed from two independent phase III trials of ADT alone or ADT+D-GETUG-AFU15 (N=385) and CHAARTED (N=790), with median follow-ups for survivors of 83.2 and 48.2 mo, respectively. The definition of HV and LV disease was harmonized.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary end point was OS.  Results and limitations:   Meta-analysis results of the aggregate data showed significant heterogeneity in ADT+D versus ADT effect sizes between HV and LV subgroups (p=0.017), and failed to detect heterogeneity in ADT+D versus ADT effect sizes between upfront and PRLT subgroups (p=0.4).

For early cancer detection, we should identify tumors in initial stages before the physical signs become visible. The present study aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), its comparison with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in prostate cancer screening and also in patients with localized prostate cancer, metastatic form, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Methods:   The participants of this study were selected from 126 patients with genitourinary symptoms suspected prostate cancer, rising PSA, and/or abnormal rectal examination results and 10 healthy subjects as controls. Peripheral blood plasma before any treatment measures was considered. cfDNA was extracted using a commercial kit, and PSA levels were measured by ELISA. The ANOVA test was used to compare the average serum level of PSA and plasma concentration of cfDNA between the groups. The correlation between variables was measured by the Pearson test.  Results:   The subgroups consisted of 50 patients with localized prostate cancer, 26 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, 50 patients with BPH, and 10 healthy subjects; the average concentrations of cfDNA in these subgroups were 15.04, 19.62, 9.51, and 8.7 ng/μl, respectively.

Our aim was to set up a validated multicenter pipeline to measure AR-V7 by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) in RNA isolated from CellSearch-enriched CTCs to provide an AR-V7-positive or AR-V7-negative score in a clinically acceptable time range. CellSearch-enirched CTCs from patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were characterized by RT-qPCR. After optimization, it was prospectively tested whether it was possible to report the AR-V7 status within 11 days (PRELUDE study). In the range of the RNA equivalent of 0.2 to 12 VCaP cells, the CV for AR-V7 was 9% (n = 37). The limit of detection was 0.3, and the limit of quantitation was 3 cells in the final RT-qPCR. No differences were observed between AR-V7 data generated by five technicians or in two different laboratories. For the 45 patients in PRELUDE, 13 patients were ineligible, 22 patients were AR-V7 negative, and 10 were AR-V7 positive. The median time to inform the physician of the test result was 7 days (range, 2 to 11 days). This assay can establish the AR-V7 status in CTCs from patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 415 men who consecutively presented for prostate biopsy between November 2014 and September 2016 at our tertiary care center. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was performed using a 3 Tesla device without an endorectal coil, followed by transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy with the BiopSee® fusion system. Additional fusion guided targeted biopsy was done in men with a suspicious lesion on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, defined as Likert score 3 to 5. Any Gleason pattern 4 or greater was defined as clinically significant prostate cancer. The detection rates of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and fusion guided targeted biopsy were compared with the detection rate of transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy using the McNemar test.  Results:   We obtained a median of 40 (range 30 to 55) and 3 (range 2 to 4) transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy and fusion guided targeted biopsy cores, respectively. Of the 124 patients (29.9%) without a suspicious lesion on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging 32 (25.8%) were found to have clinically significant prostate cancer on transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy. Of the 291 patients (70.1%) with a Likert score of 3 to 5 clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in 129 (44.3%) by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging fusion guided targeted biopsy, in 176 (60.5%) by transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy and in 187 (64.3%) by the combined approach. Overall 58 cases (19.9%) of clinically significant prostate cancer would have been missed if fusion guided targeted biopsy had been performed exclusively. The sensitivity of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and fusion guided targeted biopsy for clinically significant prostate cancer was 84.6% and 56.7% with a negative likelihood ratio of 0.35 and 0.46, respectively.  Conclusions:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging alone should not be performed as a triage test due to a substantial number of false-negative cases with clinically significant prostate cancer. Systematic biopsy outperformed fusion guided targeted biopsy.

Methods:   Twenty-two men underwent a CT simulation with a Foley in place (FCT), followed immediately by a second treatment planning simulation without the Foley (TPCT). The change in prostate orientation was determined by rigid registration of three implanted transponders between FCT and TPCT and compared to measured orientation changes during treatment. The impact on treatment planning and delivery was investigated by analyzing the measured rotations during treatment relative to both CT scans, and introducing rotations of ±15° in the treatment plan to determine the maximum impact of allowed rotations.  Results:   Removing the Foley caused a statistically significant prostate rotation (P < 0.0028) compared to normal biological motion in 60% of patients. The largest change in rotation due to removing a Foley occurs about the left-right axis (tilt) which has a standard deviation two to five times larger than changes in rotation about the Sup-Inf (roll) and Ant-Post (yaw) axes. The change in tilt due to removing a Foley for prone and supine patients was -1.1° ± 6.0° and 0.3° ± 7.4°, showing no strong directional bias. The average tilt during treatment was -1.6° ± 7.1° compared to the TPCT and would have been -2.0° ± 7.1° had the FCT been used as the reference. The TPCT was a better or equivalent representation of prostate tilt in 82% of patients, vs 50% had the FCT been used for treatment planning. However, 92.7% of fractions would still have been within the ±15° rotation limit if only the FCT were used for treatment planning. When rotated ±15°, urethra V105% = 38.85Gy < 20% was exceeded in 27% of the instances, and prostate (CTV) coverage was maintained above D95% > 37 Gy in all but one instance.  Conclusions:   Removing a Foley catheter can cause large prostate rotations. There does not appear to be a clear dosimetric benefit to obtaining the CT scan with a Foley catheter to define the urethra given the changes in urethral position from removing the Foley catheter. If urethral sparing is desired without the use of a Foley, utilization of an MRI to define the urethra may be necessary, or a pseudo-urethral planning organ at risk volume (PRV) may be used to limit dosimetric hot spots.""","""['Dale W Litzenberg', 'Daniel G Muenz', 'Paul G Archer', 'William C Jackson', 'Daniel A Hamstra', 'Jason W Hearn', 'Matthew J Schipper', 'Daniel E Spratt']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Pelvic organ motion and dosimetric implications during horizontal patient rotation for prostate radiation therapy.', 'The urethral position may shift due to urethral catheter placement in the treatment planning for prostate radiation therapy.', 'Dosimetric impact of intrafraction rotations in stereotactic prostate radiotherapy: A subset analysis of the TROG 15.01 SPARK trial.', 'Simple diagrammatic method to delineate male urethra in prostate cancer radiotherapy: an MRI based approach.', 'A Primer and Literature Review on Internal and External Retention Mechanisms for Catheter Fixation.', 'The use of a thin guide-wire for urethral definition in prostate SBRT treatments with Cyberknife.', 'Deep learning-based segmentation of prostatic urethra on computed tomography scans for treatment planning.', 'Urethral Interfractional Geometric and Dosimetric Variations of Prostate Cancer Patients: A Study Using an Onboard MRI.', 'Development of a 3D CNN-based AI Model for Automated Segmentation of the Prostatic Urethra.', 'Evaluation of T2-Weighted MRI for Visualization and Sparing of Urethra with MR-Guided Radiation Therapy (MRgRT) On-Board MRI.']"""

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathway is linked to health disparities in AAs. Recent studies suggest a role of TGFβ3 in cancer metastases and its effect on the migratory and invasive behavior; however, its role in PCa in AA men has not been studied. We determined the circulating levels of TGFβ3 in AA and CA men diagnosed with PCa using ELISA. We analyzed serum samples from both AA and CA men diagnosed with and without PCa. We show that AA PCa patients had higher levels of TGFβ3 protein compared with AA controls and CA patients. In fact, TGFβ3 protein levels in serum were higher in AA men without PCa compared with the CA population, which may correlate with more aggressive disease seen in AA men. Studies on AA-derived PCa cell lines revealed that TGFβ3 protein levels were also higher in these cells compared with CA-derived PCa cell lines. Our studies also reveal that TGFβ does not inhibit cell proliferation in AA-derived PCa cell lines, but it does induce migration and invasion through activation of PI3K pathway. We suggest that increased TGFβ3 levels are responsible for development of aggressive PCa in AA patients as a consequence of development of resistance to inhibitory effects of TGFβ on cell proliferation and induction of invasive metastatic behavior.""","""['Bethtrice Elliott', 'DeAdra L Zackery', 'Vanessa A Eaton', ""Re'Josef T Jones"", 'Fisseha Abebe', 'Camille C Ragin', 'Shafiq A Khan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Expression of TGFβ3 and its effects on migratory and invasive behavior of prostate cancer cells: involvement of PI3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway.', 'Epigenetic analysis identifies factors driving racial disparity in prostate cancer.', 'Racial disparity in prostate cancer in the African American population with actionable ideas and novel immunotherapies.', 'Differences in the aggressiveness of prostate cancer among Korean, Caucasian, and African American men: A retrospective cohort study of radical prostatectomy.', 'Is active surveillance a suitable option for African American men with prostate cancer?

Patients and methods:   Men undergoing RP between 1988 and 2015 with known final pathological margin status were evaluated. The cohort was divided into three groups based on margin status; NSM, PSM, and CSM. CSM were defined by distance of tumour ≤1 mm from the surgical margin. BCR was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of >0.2 ng/mL, two values at 0.2 ng/mL, or secondary treatment for an elevated PSA level. Predictors of BCR, metastases, and mortality were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   Of 5515 men in the SEARCH database, 4337 (79%) men met criteria for inclusion in the analysis. Of these, 2063 (48%) had NSM, 1902 (44%) had PSM, and 372 (8%) had CSM.

Material and methods:   A total of 120 patients with an established diagnosis of either locally advanced or metastatic Pca in two different centers.

Methods:   Researchers conducted a cross-sectional survey of homeless individuals (n = 201). The analysis describes the demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral associations with cancer screenings and knowledge of the lung cancer screening recommendation.  Results:   Participants' mean age was 51.7 years (SD 13.6); the group was largely African American (77.3%) and male (67.9%). Among women, the breast and cervical cancer screening rates were 46.5% and 85.1%. Among men the prostate cancer screening rate was 34.2%. Among all participants, the colon cancer screening rate was 44%. Cancer risk behaviors were high. Lung cancer screening knowledge was low (23.0%). Some cancer screening behaviors were associated with age, income, health status, obesity, tobacco use, and physical activity.

However, the role of docetaxel in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) has not been fully investigated. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the potential role of docetaxel in nmCRPC. Clinical outcomes including overall survival were compared between CRPC patients who had docetaxel introduced while in nonmetastatic versus metastatic diseases.  Methods:   A total of 98 CRPC patients had docetaxel therapy. Of these 46 patients received docetaxel for nmCRPC, and 52 had distant metastases. Clinical outcomes from the time of diagnosis of CRPC were compared retrospectively between groups.  Results:   The median observation period after the diagnosis of CRPC in these patients was 42 months (range, 3-166). Overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in the nmCRPC group than in the mCRPC group (not reached vs 52.2 months, respectively, P = 0.006). Multivariate analysis showed that longer time to CRPC, docetaxel use in nmCRPC, and use of abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide were significant predictors for improved OS (P = 0.04, 0.019 and 0.002, respectively).

The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the role of multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) in the indication to perform pelvic lymph nodes dissection (PLND) or not in patients with risk of LNI according to BN below 5%.  Methods:   Since March 2012 and September 2016, 310 patients who underwent a preoperative mp-MRI for staging purpose and subsequent robot-assisted extended PLND (RAEPLND) were retrospectively evaluated. Mp-MRIs were prospectively analyzed by two experienced radiologists. The imaging parameters analyzed were the presence of extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicles invasion (SVI) and predominant Gleason pattern 4 (pG4). All patients underwent RAEPLND by two experienced surgeons with a standardized technique. A dedicated uropathologist performed all pathological analysis. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used in order to identify the predictors of LNI in patients with PCa.  Results:   In the overall population, 57 (18.4%) patients had histologically proven pN1 disease. 48/250 patients (19.2%) with a risk of LNI ≥5% as calculated by the BN were staged pN1 at final histopathological analysis. 9/60 patients (15.0%) with a risk of LNI <5% as calculated by BN, who underwent RAEPLND anyway according to the findings at mp-MRI, were staged pN1 at final histopathological analysis. At multivariate logistic regression analysis, all the three mp-MRI parameters were significant independent predictors of LNI after RAEPLND.

Methods:   In total, 477 IMRT/VMAT plans for prostate or head and neck (H&N) malignancies were retrospectively analyzed using a modified Clarkson-based commercial verification program. The doses from the TPSs and verification programs were compared using the mean ±1 standard deviation (SD).  Results:   In the TPS-calculated dose comparisons for prostate and H&N malignancies, the sliding window (SW) technique (-2.5 ± 1.8% and -5.3 ± 2.6%) showed greater negative systematic differences than the step-and-shoot (S&S) technique (-0.3 ± 2.2% and -0.8 ± 2.2%). The VMAT dose differences for prostate and H&N malignancies were 0.9 ± 1.8% and 1.1 ± 3.3%, respectively. The SDs were larger for the H&N plans than for the prostate plans in both IMRT and VMAT. Such plans including more out-of-field control points showed greater systematic differences and SDs.

Five prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT (74 Gy/37 Fr) were studied.

Dose difference at isocenter between measurement and reconstructed dose for two software programs was within 3.0% in both homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms. Moreover, the dose difference was larger using skip arc plan than that using full arc plan, especially for PerFRACTION (e.g., dose difference at isocenter for PerFRACTION: 0.34% for full arc plan vs. -4.50% for skip arc plan in patient 1).

Material and methods:   Real-time 6DoF prostate motion was acquired using KIM for 14 prostate cancer patients (377 fractions). KIM outputs the 6DoF prostate motion, combining 3D translation and 3D rotational motion information relative to its planning position. The corresponding groundtruth target motion was obtained post-treatment based on kV/MV triangulation. The accuracy and precision of the 6DoF KIM motion estimates were calculated as the mean and standard deviation differences compared with the ground-truth.  Results:   The accuracy ± precision of real-time 6DoF KIM-measured prostate motion were 0.2 ± 1.3° for rotations and 0.1 ± 0.5 mm for translations, respectively. The magnitude of KIM-measured motion was well-correlated with the magnitude of ground-truth motion resulting in Pearson correlation coefficients of ≥0.88 in all DoF.  Conclusions:   The results demonstrate that KIM is capable of providing the real-time 6DoF prostate target motion during patient treatments with an accuracy ± precision of within 0.2 ± 1.3° and 0.1 ± 0.5 mm for rotation and translation, respectively.

Hence, there is an urgent need for clinically relevant biomarkers capable of distinguishing between aggressive and nonaggressive forms of prostate cancer to aid in stratification, management and therapeutic decisions. To address this unmet need, we investigated the patterns of expression of a panel of 68 plasma-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) in a cohort of African American (AA) and European American (EA) prostate cancer patients (n = 114). miRNA qPCR results were analyzed using in-depth statistical methods, and a bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify potential targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs. Our data demonstrate that a new previously unreported circulating miRNA signature consisting of a combination of interacting miRNAs (miR-17/miR-192) and an independent miRNA (miR-181a) are capable of segregating aggressive and nonaggressive prostate cancer in both AA and EA patients.

It is unclear whether MRI itself adds additional value to multivariable prediction models based on clinical parameters.  Objective:   To determine whether an MRI-based prediction model can reduce unnecessary biopsies in patients with suspected prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients underwent MRI, MRI-TRUS fusion-guided biopsy, and 12-core systematic biopsy in 1 session. The development cohort used to derive the prediction model consisted of 400 patients from 1 institution enrolled between May 14, 2015, and August 31, 2016, and the validation cohort included 251 patients from 2 independent institutions who underwent biopsies between April 1, 2013, and June 30, 2016, at 1 institution and between July 1, 2015, and October 31, 2016, at the other institution. The MRI model included MRI-derived parameters in addition to clinical variables. Area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves and decision curve analysis were performed.  Main outcomes and measures:   Risk of clinically significant prostate cancer on biopsy, defined as a Gleason score of 3 + 4 or higher in at least 1 biopsy core.  Results:   Overall, 193 (48.3%) of the 400 patients in the development cohort (mean [SD] age at biopsy, 64.3 [7.1] years) and 96 (38.2%) of the 251 patients in the validation cohort (mean [SD] age at biopsy, 64.9 [7.2] years) had clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as a Gleason score greater than or equal to 3 + 4. By applying the model to the external validation cohort, the area under the curve increased from 64% to 84% compared with the baseline model (P < .001). At a risk threshold of 20%, the MRI model had a lower false-positive rate than the baseline model (46% [95% CI, 32%-66%] vs 92% [95% CI, 70%-100%]), with only a small reduction in the true-positive rate (89% [95% CI, 85%-96%] vs 99% [95% CI, 89%-100%]). Eighteen of 100 fewer biopsies could have been performed, with no increase in the number of patients with missed clinically significant prostate cancers.

Aims:   This study compares practice patterns in utilization of PLND between Indian and United States (US) practices.  Settings and design:   We focused on 415 patients (204 India; 211 US) prostate cancer patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, between 2015 and 2016, within the Vattikuti Collective Quality Initiative database.  Subjects and methods:   Utilization of PLND and number of nodes removed were evaluated for the entire cohort, and after stratifying for Country of treatment and D'Amico risk groups. Logistic regression tested the relationship between PLND and country of treatment, after adjusting for disease risk.  Results:   Indian patients had a higher risk distribution (D'Amico high-risk 53.4% in India vs. 27% in the US; P< 0.001) compared to their US counterparts. Overall, 193/204 (94.6%) Indian patients underwent PLND versus 181/211 (85.8%) US patients (P = 0.003). When stratified based on disease risk, PLND was performed more frequently in Indian patients with low-risk disease (81.0% vs. 41.4%,P= 0.008), but not in those with intermediate and high-risk disease. On multivariable analysis, Indian patients had a 2.57-fold higher probability of undergoing PLND than their US counterparts (P = 0.02). The analysis of the number of lymph nodes removed showed similar trends.  Conclusions:   Indian patients are more likely to undergo PLND than US patients. This is, especially true for patients with low-risk disease, who are unlikely to benefit from this procedure. Efforts should focus on optimizing the utilization of PLND, and deliver it only when there is clinical indication.""","""['F Abdollah', 'S Arora', 'T Jindal', 'P Gild', 'A Sood', 'T B Yuvaraja', 'R K Ahlawat', 'N P Gupta', 'M Bhandari', 'M Menon']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Indian J Cancer""","""['Utilization of Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection for Patients With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated With Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Indication for and extension of pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: an analysis of five European institutions.', 'The impact of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy on the use and extent of pelvic lymph node dissection in the ""post-dissemination"" period.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'The role of extended pelvic lymphadenectomy with radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer.']"""

Methods and results:   We found that GPRC6A, a multi-ligand-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor that regulates energy metabolism, sex hormone production, and prostate cancer progression, is a target for gallates. Sodium gallate (SG), gallic acid (GA) > ethyl gallate (EG) > octyl gallate (OG) dose dependently activated ERK in HEK-293 cells transfected with GPRC6A but not in non-transfected controls. SG also stimulated insulin secretion in β-cells isolated from wild-type mice similar to the endogenous GPRC6A ligands, osteocalcin (Ocn) and testosterone (T). Side-chain additions to create OG resulted in loss of GPRC6A agonist activity. Another component of green tea, epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), dose-dependently inhibited Ocn activation of GPRC6A in HEK-293 cells transfected with GPRC6A and blocked the effect of Ocn in stimulating glucose production in CH10T1/2 cells. Using structural models of the venus fly trap (VFT) and 7-transmembrane (7-TM) domains of GPRC6A, calculations suggest that l-amino acids and GA bind to the VFT, whereas EGCG is calculated to bind to sites in both the VFT and 7-TM.  Conclusion:   GA and EGCG have offsetting agonist and antagonist effects on GPRC6A that may account for the variable metabolic effect of green tea consumption.""","""['Min Pi', 'Karan Kapoor', 'Ruisong Ye', 'Jeremy C Smith', 'Jerome Baudry', 'Leigh D Quarles']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Nutr Food Res""","""['Evidence for Osteocalcin Binding and Activation of GPRC6A in β-Cells.', 'Amyloid Aggregation of Insulin: An Interaction Study of Green Tea Constituents.', 'Study of the release of gallic acid from (-)-epigallocatechin gallate in old oolong tea by mass spectrometry.', 'Multiligand specificity and wide tissue expression of GPRC6A reveals new endocrine networks.', 'In Vitro and In Silico Studies of the Molecular Interactions of Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) with Proteins That Explain the Health Benefits of Green Tea.', 'Identification of G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) as a target of curcumin.', 'Additive Effects of L-Ornithine on Preferences to Basic Taste Solutions in Mice.', 'Binding of Androgen- and Estrogen-Like Flavonoids to Their Cognate (Non)Nuclear Receptors: A Comparison by Computational Prediction.', 'Humanized GPRC6AKGKY is a gain-of-function polymorphism in mice.', 'Retrospective ensemble docking of allosteric modulators in an adenosine G-protein-coupled receptor.']"""

Methods:   From patient-reported information on 10 OCSG, the PRIME framework automatically filtered and extracted conversations on low intermediate-risk PCa with active user participation. Side effects as well as emotional and QoL outcomes for 6084 patients were analyzed.  Results:   Side-effect profiles differed between the methods analyzed, with men after RP having more urinary and sexual side effects and men after EBRT having more bowel symptoms. Key findings from the analysis of emotional expressions showed that PCa patients younger than 40 years expressed significantly high positive and negative emotions compared with other age groups, that partners of patients expressed more negative emotions than the patients, and that selected cohorts (< 40 years, > 70 years, partners of patients) have frequently used the same terms to express their emotions, which is indicative of QoL issues specific to those cohorts.  Conclusion:   Despite recent advances in patient-centerd care, patient emotions are largely overlooked, especially in younger men with a diagnosis of PCa and their partners.

The potential gain of such an approach, the improvement of tumor control, and reduction of the dose to organs-at-risk at the same time was analyzed using the QUANTEC biological model.  Methods:   Twenty-one prostate cancer patients (70 years average) without previous local therapy received 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT imaging. Organs-at-risk and standard prostate target volumes were manually defined on the obtained datasets. A PET active volume (PTV_PET) was segmented with a 40% of the maximum activity uptake in the lesion as threshold followed by manual adaption. Five different treatment plan variations were calculated for each patient. Analysis of derived treatment plans was done according to QUANTEC with in-house developed software. Tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was calculated for all plan variations.  Results:   Comparing the conventional plans to the plans with integrated boost and plans just treating the PET-positive tumor volume, we found that TCP increased to (95.2 ± 0.5%) for an integrated boost with 75.6 Gy, (98.1 ± 0.3%) for an integrated boost with 80 Gy, (94.7 ± 0.8%) for treatment of PET-positive volume with 75 Gy, and to (99.4 ± 0.1%) for treating PET-positive volume with 95 Gy (all p < 0.0001). For the integrated boost with 80 Gy, a significant increase of the median NTCP of the rectum was found, for all other plans no statistical significant increase in the NTCP neither of the rectum nor the bladder was found.  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrates that the use of 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT image information allows for more individualized prostate treatment planning.

In the current study, to identify the crucial miRNA-mRNA regulatory biomodule involved into prostate carcinogenesis based on the previous miRNA expression profile in PCa, we proposed an integrated systematic approach which combined miRNA-mediated gene expression regulatory network analysis, experimental validations in vitro and in vivo, as well as clinical significance evaluation. As a result, the CCND1-RNASEL-CDKN1A-TP73-MDM2-UBE2I axis was identified as a bottleneck in the miRNA-mediated gene expression regulatory network of PCa according to network topological analysis. The direct binding relationship between TP73 and PCa downregulated miR-193a-5p, and the direct binding relationship between UBE2I and PCa upregulated miR-188-5p were both experimentally validated. In addition, miR-193a-5p had a more significant regulatory effect on the tumor promoter isoform of TP73-deltaNp73 than on the tumor suppressive isoform of TP73-TAp73. Importantly, the deregulation of either the miR-193a-5p-TP73 or miR-188-5p-UBE2I axes was significantly associated with aggressive progression and poor prognosis in PCa patients. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that miR-193a-5p efficiently inhibited in vitro PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and in vivo tumor growth, and markedly induced PCa cell apoptosis via regulating TP73 with a corresponding suppression of the CCND1-RNASEL-CDKN1A-MDM2 axis. In contrast, miR-188-5p exerted its tumor promoter roles through targeting UBE2I with a subsequent activation of the CCND1-RNASEL-CDKN1A-MDM2 axis. Taken together, this integrated analysis revealed the potential roles of the miR-193a-5p/TP73 and miR-188-5p/UBE2i negative regulation pairs in PCa. In addition to the significant clinical relevance, miR-193a-5p- and miR-188-5p-regulated CCND1-RNASEL-CDKN1A-TP73-MDM2-UBE2I signaling may be a novel regulatory biomodule in prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Yanqiong Zhang', 'Funeng Jiang', 'Huichan He', 'Jianheng Ye', 'Xia Mao', 'Qiuyan Guo', 'Shu-Lin Wu', 'Weide Zhong', 'Chin-Lee Wu', 'Na Lin']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['MicroRNA-27a-5p regulation by promoter methylation and MYC signaling in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'miR-221-5p regulates proliferation and migration in human prostate cancer cells and reduces tumor growth in vivo.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'A Review on the Role of miR-149-5p in the Carcinogenesis.', 'The Regulatory Mechanism of miR-574-5p Expression in Cancer.', 'Identification of Candidate MicroRNA-mRNA Subnetwork for Predicting the Osteosarcoma Progression by Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'MicroRNA‑193a‑5p exerts a tumor suppressive role in\xa0epithelial ovarian cancer by modulating RBBP6.', 'miR-182 modulates cell proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer via targeting ST6GALNAC5.', 'Regulation of breast cancer metastasis signaling by miRNAs.', 'A Discovery of Clinically Approved Formula FBRP for Repositioning to Treat HCC by Inhibiting PI3K/AKT/NF-κB Activation.']"""

Although ADSL was reported to be upregulated in various malignancies, such as colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, as well as gliomas, the mechanism by which elevated ADSL expression contributes to cancer has not been elucidated. We previously performed a shotgun proteomics analysis to characterize specific proteins associated with the properties of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-high cell population, which was reported to be involved in tumorigenic potential, and showed that ADSL expression is upregulated in the ALDH-high population of endometrial cancer. Here, we showed that ADSL is involved in endometrial cancer aggressiveness by regulating expression of killer cell lectin-like receptor C3 (KLRC3), which is a receptor expressed on natural killer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that ADSL expression increased as endometrioid carcinoma specimens became more poorly differentiated and higher degree of primary tumor progression. Knockdown of ADSL in endometrial cancer cells decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasive capability, and caused the cells to adopt a more rounded shape. DNA microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR showed that KLRC3 expression was decreased in ADSL knockdown cells. Knockdown of KLRC3 in endometrial cancer cells resulted in the same phenotype as knockdown of ADSL. Moreover, fumarate, which could be produced by ADSL and was recently shown to be an oncometabolite, recovered KLRC3 expression in ADSL knockdown cells, suggesting that fumarate produced by ADSL could regulate KLRC3 expression. Our findings indicate that ADSL enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasive capability through regulation of KLRC3 expression by fumarate.""","""['Haengki Park#', 'Kenji Ohshima#', 'Satoshi Nojima', 'Shinichiro Tahara', 'Masako Kurashige', 'Yumiko Hori', 'Daisuke Okuzaki', 'Naoki Wada', 'Jun-Ichiro Ikeda', 'Eiichi Morii']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Lab Invest""","""['Adenylosuccinate lyase is oncogenic in colorectal cancer by causing mitochondrial dysfunction and independent activation of NRF2 and mTOR-MYC-axis.', 'Targeting the De Novo Purine Synthesis Pathway Through Adenylosuccinate Lyase Depletion Impairs Liver Cancer Growth by Perturbing Mitochondrial Function.', 'KLRC3, a Natural Killer receptor gene, is a key factor involved in glioblastoma tumourigenesis and aggressiveness.', 'Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.', 'Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.', 'Role of mitochondrial alterations in human cancer progression and cancer immunity.', 'The Intersection of Purine and Mitochondrial Metabolism in Cancer.', 'Carcinogenic effect of adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) in prostate cancer development and progression through the cell cycle pathway.', 'A Metabolic Model of Intestinal Secretions: The Link between Human Microbiota and Colorectal Cancer Progression.', 'An in vivo genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies the RNA-binding protein Staufen2 as a key regulator of myeloid leukemia.']"""

Methods:   A total of 11 plans, 5 prostate and 6 head/neck, were selected to represent known good plans based on their high-passing rate using conventional IMRT QA criteria. These were modified by moving the programmed MLC positions to underdose the target or overdose important structures by varying amounts. Commercially available hardware/software was used to measure and analyze all plans (76 total) using 4%/3 mm, 3%/3 mm, 3%/2 mm, and 2%/2 mm gamma criteria. Two receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves per criterion were created to assess effective passing rates. One ROC curve was to find a higher threshold that determined a clear pass and the second to find a lower threshold to determine a clear failure. Plans between these two thresholds need DVH-based analysis to assess the clinical consequence of the dose difference. The modified plans were analyzed in the planning system and reconstructed in commercially available DVH-based analysis software to access the accuracy and usefulness of the software.  Results:   Analysis of the ROC curves showed optimal pass and fail thresholds for plan error detection per criterion to achieve clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. Based on measurement uncertainty and pass/fail ranges, 3%/2 mm gamma criteria with a pass threshold of 95% and a fail threshold of 90% were most optimal. DVH analysis showed good agreement with all reconstructed plans except where the changes to the MLC patterns caused the periphery of the target to be underdosed. For questionable plans, comparing the organ-specific DVHs to the physician-provided planning constraints proved to be an efficient and effective workflow since plans for which the target dose was slightly high or where organs at risk were underdosed could be released for the treatment without consulting the physician for a clinical decision.  Conclusion:   This work indicates the potential for appreciable improvement in error detection for IMRT QA. Using effective pass/fail thresholds to determine plans that need DVH-based analysis minimizes the need for excessive, time-consuming, analysis, and making use of the dosimetric constraints of the plan minimizes the burden on physicians. Overall, DVH-based analysis is a powerful tool that can provide substantial insight over the traditional approach that does not provide structure-specific data.""","""['Cassandra Stambaugh', 'Gary Ezzell']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Improvements in treatment planning calculations motivated by tightening IMRT QA tolerances.', 'Biological consequences of MLC calibration errors in IMRT delivery and QA.', 'Accuracy of one algorithm used to modify a planned DVH with data from actual dose delivery.', 'Tolerance limits and methodologies for IMRT measurement-based verification QA: Recommendations of AAPM Task Group No. 218.', 'A six-year review of more than 13,000 patient-specific IMRT QA results from 13 different treatment sites.', 'Assessment of Statistical Process Control Based DVH Action Levels for Systematic Multi-Leaf Collimator Errors in Cervical Cancer RapidArc Plans.', 'Survey results of 3D-CRT and IMRT quality assurance practice.', 'Technical note: A modified gamma evaluation method for dose distribution comparisons.', 'Improvements in treatment planning calculations motivated by tightening IMRT QA tolerances.']"""

Methods: A metaheuristic approach with a Genetic Algorithm with Levy Flight (GA-LV) was applied for classification of cancer genes in microarrays. The experimental results were analyzed with five major cancer gene expression benchmark datasets. Result: GA-LV proved superior to GA and statistical approaches, with 100% accuracy for the dataset for Leukemia, Lung and Lymphoma.

We investigated whether dose escalation of VD3 over several weeks, to model the increase in physiological VD3 levels if an oral supplement were prescribed, would be as or more effective than a single treatment 1 to 2 days prior to freezing. PC-3 cells in log phase growth to model aggressive, highly metabolically active prostate cancer were exposed to a gradually increasing dose of VD3 to a final dose of 80 nM over a 4-week period, maintained for 2 weeks at 80 nM, and then exposed to mild sublethal freezing temperatures. Results demonstrate that both acute 24-hour exposure to 80 nM VD3 and dose escalation resulted in enhanced cell death following freezing at -15°C or colder, with no significant differences between the 2 exposure regimes. Apoptotic analysis within the initial 24-hour period postfreeze revealed that VD3 treatment induced both caspase 8- and 9-mediated cell death, most notably in caspase 8 at 8-hour postfreeze. These results indicate that both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are involved in VD3 sensitization prior to freezing. Additionally, both acute and gradual dose escalation regimes of VD3 exposure increase prostate cancer cell sensitivity to mild freezing.

Objective:   To evaluate the clinical implications and genomic features of low-PSA, high-grade disease.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a retrospective study of clinical data for 494 793 patients from the National Cancer Data Base and 136 113 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program with cT1-4N0M0 prostate cancer (median follow-up 48.9 and 25.0 mo, respectively), and genomic data for 4960 patients from the Decipher Genomic Resource Information Database. Data were collected for 2004-2017.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable Fine-Gray and Cox regressions were used to analyze prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality, respectively.  Results and limitations:   For Gleason 8-10 disease, using PSA 4.1-10.0ng/ml (n=38 719) as referent, the distribution of PCSM by PSA was U-shaped, with an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) of 2.70 for PSA ≤2.5ng/ml (n=3862, p<0.001) versus 1.97, 1.36, and 2.56 for PSA of 2.6-4.0 (n=4199), 10.1-20.0 (n=17 372), and >20.0ng/ml (n=16 114), respectively. By contrast, the distribution of PCSM by PSA was linear for Gleason ≤7 (using PSA 4.1-10.0ng/ml as the referent, n=359 898), with an AHR of 0.41 (p=0.13) for PSA ≤2.5ng/ml (n=37 812) versus 1.38, 2.28, and 4.61 for PSA of 2.6-4.0 (n=54 152), 10.1-20.0 (n=63 319), and >20.0ng/ml (n=35 459), respectively (pinteraction<0.001). Gleason 8-10, PSA ≤2.5ng/ml disease had a significantly higher PCSM than standard high-risk/very high-risk disease with PSA >2.5ng/ml (AHR 2.15, p=0.002; 47-mo PCSM 14% vs 4.9%). Among Gleason 8-10 patients treated with radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy was associated with a survival benefit for PSA >2.5ng/ml (AHR 0.87; p<0.001) but not ≤2.5ng/ml (AHR 1.36; p=0.084; pinteraction=0.021). For Gleason 8-10 tumors, PSA ≤2.5ng/ml was associated with higher expression of neuroendocrine/small-cell markers compared to >2.5ng/ml (p=0.046), with no such relationship for Gleason ≤7 disease.  Conclusions:   Low-PSA, high-grade prostate cancer has very high risk for PCSM, potentially responds poorly to androgen deprivation therapy, and is associated with neuroendocrine genomic features.  Patient summary:   In this study, we found that low-prostate-specific antigen, high-grade prostate cancer has a very high risk for prostate cancer death, may not respond well to androgen deprivation therapy, and is associated with neuroendocrine genomic features. These findings suggest that current nomograms and treatment paradigms may need modification.""","""['Brandon A Mahal', 'David D Yang', 'Natalie Q Wang', 'Mohammed Alshalalfa', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Voleak Choeurng', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Robert B Den', 'Neil E Martin', 'Kent W Mouw', 'Peter F Orio rd', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Mary-Ellen Taplin', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Paul L Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['The Androgen Signaling Axis and Risk Stratification for High-grade Prostate Cancer.', 'Re: Brandon A.

To our knowledge no prior report has examined the impact of androgen deprivation therapy on self-reported cognitive function.  Materials and methods:   Three groups of men 50 years old or older who were matched on age and education were enrolled in the study, including 81 with prostate cancer starting on continuous androgen deprivation therapy, 84 controls with prostate cancer not receiving androgen deprivation therapy and 85 healthy controls. Two scales from the FACT-Cog (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive subscale) version 3 were used to assess self-reported cognitive function. Changes in cognitive scores with time were analyzed by 2 approaches, including 1) multivariable regression and 2) calculation of the proportion of subjects per group with a decrease of 1 SD or more. Multivariable regression was applied to assess predictors of a decline in self-reported cognitive function. We also examined relationships between the FACT-Cog and a neuropsychological battery of 15 tests.  Results:   Mean participant age was 69 years (range 50 to 87). The mean educational level was 15 years (range 8 to 24). FACT-Cog scores were similar at baseline across the cohorts. Neither analytical approach revealed that androgen deprivation therapy was associated with changes in self-reported cognitive function on either FACT-Cog scale. Mood and fatigue correlated with changes in self-reported cognitive function. The relationship between self-reported and objective cognitive measures was weak (maximum Spearman correlation coefficient 0.14) and only 2 of 30 correlations were statistically significant.  Conclusions:   A total of 12 months of androgen deprivation therapy were not associated with self-reported cognitive function changes in older men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Shireen Marzouk', 'Gary Naglie', 'George Tomlinson', 'Sarah Duff Canning', 'Henriette Breunis', 'Narhari Timilshina', 'Shabbir M H Alibhai']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on physical and cognitive function, as well as quality of life of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.', 'Effects of long-term androgen deprivation therapy on cognitive function over 36 months in men with prostate cancer.', 'Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on weight gain differs by age in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer.', 'Effects of exercise on treatment-related adverse effects for patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: a systematic review.', 'Intermittent vs Continuous Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', ""Testosterone and Alzheimer's disease."", 'Assessment and Management of Cognitive Function in Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors.', ""Impact of Testosterone on Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Long-Term Cognitive Dysfunction in Cancer Survivors.', 'A 2-year prospective analysis of insomnia as a mediator of the relationship between androgen deprivation therapy and perceived cognitive function in men with prostate cancer.']"""

We sought to describe the prevalence of urinary incontinence in a male treatment seeking cohort enrolled in the LURN (Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network).  Materials and methods:   Study inclusion and exclusion criteria, including men with prostate cancer or neurogenic bladder, were previously reported. LURN participants prospectively completed questionnaires regarding lower urinary tract symptoms and other clinical variables. Men were grouped based on incontinence type, including 1) no urinary incontinence, 2) post-void dribbling only and 3) urinary incontinence. Comparisons were made using ANOVA and multivariable regression.  Results:   Of the 477 men 24% reported no urinary incontinence, 44% reported post-void dribbling only and 32% reported urinary incontinence. African American men and those with sleep apnea were more likely to be in the urinary incontinence group than in the no urinary incontinence group (OR 3.2, p = 0.02 and OR 2.73, p = 0.003, respectively). Urinary incontinence was associated with significantly higher bother compared to men without leakage (p <0.001). Compared to men without urinary incontinence and men with only post-void dribbling those with urinary incontinence were significantly more likely to report higher scores (more severe symptoms) on the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) questionnaires regarding bowel issues, depression and anxiety than men without urinary incontinence (p <0.01).  Conclusions:   Urinary incontinence is common among treatment seeking men. This is concerning because the guideline recommended questionnaires to assess male lower urinary tract symptoms do not query for urinary incontinence. Thus, clinicians may be missing an opportunity to intervene and improve patient care. This provides a substantial rationale for a new or updated symptom questionnaire which provides a more comprehensive symptom assessment.""","""['Brian T Helfand', 'Abigail R Smith', 'H Henry Lai', 'Claire C Yang', 'John L Gore', 'Brad A Erickson', 'Karl J Kreder', 'Anne P Cameron', 'Kevin P Weinfurt', 'James W Griffith', 'Aaron Lentz', 'Pooja Talaty', 'Victor P Andreev', 'Ziya Kirkali;LURN']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Baseline Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Patients Enrolled in LURN: A Prospective, Observational Cohort Study.', 'The 10-item LURN Symptom Index (LURN SI-10) Detects Additional Symptoms and Shows Convergent Validity With the IPSS in Men Presenting With Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms.', 'Mental Health, Sleep and Physical Function in Treatment Seeking Women with Urinary Incontinence.', 'EAU Guidelines on the Assessment of Non-neurogenic Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms including Benign Prostatic Obstruction.', 'Epidemiology and classification of urinary incontinence.', 'Association of urinary incontinence with depression among men: a cross-sectional study.', 'Physiotherapy as an Effective Method to Support the Treatment of Male Urinary Incontinence: A Systematic Review.', 'Impact of Sleep Disturbance, Physical Function, Depression and Anxiety on Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: Results from the Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN).', 'Regions of the brain activated in bladder filling vs rectal distention in healthy adults: A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies.', 'Contemporary diagnosis of lower urinary tract dysfunction.']"""

Materials and methods:   Transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and transperineal prostate mapping biopsy were performed in 426 patients between April 2012 and January 2016. Patients initially underwent systematic 12 core transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy followed 3 months later by 1.5 Tesla, high resolution T2, diffusion-weighted, dynamic contrast enhanced multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Two specialist uroradiologists blinded to the results of transperineal prostate mapping biopsy allocated a PI-RADS™ (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System) score to each multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging study. Transperineal prostate mapping biopsy with 5 mm interval sampling, which was performed within 6 months of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, served as the reference test.  Results:   Transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy identified 247 of 426 patients with prostate cancer and 179 of 426 with benign histology. Transperineal prostate mapping biopsy detected prostate cancer in 321 of 426 patients. On transperineal prostate mapping biopsy 94 of 179 patients with benign transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy had prostate cancer and 95 of 247 with prostate cancer on transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy were identified with cancer of higher grade. Using a multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging PI-RADS score of 3 or greater to detect significant prostate cancer, defined as any core containing Gleason 4 + 3 or greater prostate cancer on transperineal prostate mapping biopsy, the ROC AUC was 0.754 (95% CI 0.677-0.819) with 87.0% sensitivity (95% CI 77.3-97.0), 55.3% specificity (95% CI 50.2-60.4) and 97.1% negative predictive value (95% CI 94.8-99.4).  Conclusions:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging is a more accurate diagnostic test than transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. However, a significant proportion of ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) Grade Group 2 prostate cancer remained undetected following multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Although multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging could avoid unnecessary biopsy in many patients with ISUP Grade Group 3 or greater prostate cancer, at less stringent definitions of significant cancer a substantial proportion of prostate cancer would remain undetected after multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.""","""['Raj P Pal', 'Ros Ahmad', 'Shaun Trecartan', 'James Voss', 'Shaista Ahmed', 'Alvaro Bazo', 'Jon Lloyd', 'Thomas J Walton']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Fusion Guided Targeted Biopsy Evaluated by Transperineal Template Saturation Prostate Biopsy for the Detection and Characterization of Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound Biopsy to Transperineal Template Mapping Biopsies Stratified by Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score in the PROMIS Trial.', 'Risk Stratification of Equivocal Lesions on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Optimization of prostate biopsy: the role of magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy in detection, localization and risk assessment.', 'Impact of PI-RADS Category 3 lesions on the diagnostic accuracy of MRI for detecting prostate cancer and the prevalence of prostate cancer within each PI-RADS category: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Retrospective Study of the Significant Predictive Role of Inflammatory Degree in Initial and Repeat Prostate Biopsy Specimens for Detecting Prostate Cancer.', 'MRI-guided localization of the dominant intraprostatic lesion and dose analysis of volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for prostate cancer.']"""

The IHC analysis detailed herein is the comprehensive biological analysis of the tumor specificity of JAA-F11 antibody performed as JAA-F11 is progressing towards preclinical safety testing and clinical trials. Wide tumor reactivity of JAA-F11, relative to the matched mouse IgG3 (control), was observed in 85% of 1269 cases of breast, lung, prostate, colon, bladder, and ovarian cancer. Staining on tissues from breast cancer cases was similar regardless of hormonal or Her2 status, and this is particularly important in finding a target on the currently untargetable triple-negative breast cancer subtype. Humanization of JAA-F11 was recently carried out as explained in a companion paper ""Humanization of JAA-F11, a Highly Specific Anti-Thomsen-Friedenreich Pancarcinoma Antibody and In Vitro Efficacy Analysis"" (Neoplasia 19: 716-733, 2017), and it was confirmed that humanization did not affect chemical specificity.

Androgen receptor (AR) plays an important role not only in initial stages of prostate cancer development but also in the advanced stage of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Role of AR in regulation of CRISP3 expression is not yet known. In order to understand the regulation of CRISP3 expression, various overlapping fragments of CRISP3 promoter were cloned in pGL3 luciferase reporter vector. All constructs were transiently and stably transfected in PC3 (CRISP3 negative) and LNCaP (CRISP3 positive) cell lines and promoter activity was measured by luciferase assay. Promoter activity of LNCaP stable clones was significantly higher than PC3 stable clones. Further in CRISP3 negative PC3 and RWPE-1 cells, CRISP3 promoter was shown to be silenced by histone deacetylation. Treatment of LNCaP cells with DHT resulted in increase in levels of CRISP3 transcript and protein. AR dependency of CRISP3 promoter was also evaluated in LNCaP stable clones by luciferase assay. To provide molecular evidence of epigenetic regulation of CRISP3 promoter and its response to DHT, ChIP PCR was performed in PC3 and LNCaP cells.

Using logistic regression models, we assessed patient-level predictors of receiving a recommendation to forgo definitive treatment and estimated associations of receiving this recommendation with receipt of definitive treatment and perceived quality of cancer care among men with low-risk tumors and limited life expectancies.  Results:   Nearly two-thirds (62.2%) of men with low-risk tumors and 46.4% with limited life expectancies received recommendations from their urologists to forgo definitive treatment.

Furthermore, to date, no observational studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between vitamin D and total cancer risk.  Methods:   We analyzed data from a population-based prospective cohort study including 2,003 initially cancer-free participants from the KORA F4 study with baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) measurements (surveyed between 2006 and 2008). We used Cox proportional hazard models to assess the association between 25(OH)D levels and incident cancer risk.  Results:   Within a follow-up period of 7 years, 69 of the participants developed cancer. Overall, we observed no significant relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and cancer risk. The hazard ratio (HR) per 1 ng/ml increase in 25 (OH)D for this relationship was 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.04) adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and season of blood draw. This was also true in subgroup analysis for prostate cancer (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88-1.03), breast cancer (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97-1.09), and colorectal cancer (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.88-1.07).

Methods All patients in this study underwent robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) performed by three different consultant urological surgeons. Data collected included preoperative clinical stage, Gleason score and prostate specific antigen levels, which were used to risk stratify patients according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria. Oncological clearance was assessed by overall and stage specific positive margin status. Comparisons were made between each surgeon for the first and second 50 consecutive cases. Results For the three surgeons, there was a progressive increase in the proportion of high risk cases referred accompanied by a corresponding decline in low risk disease (p<0.001). Postoperative pathology also showed an upward trend in pT3 cases across the three eras. There was no statistical difference in overall positive margin rates between the surgeons. The overall rates were 12%, 20% and 23% for the first 50 cases, and 32%, 36% and 21% for the second 50 cases for the three surgeons respectively. Conclusions Our series demonstrates an upward trend in the risk profile of men referred for robotic prostatectomy over a nine-year period. Despite this, there was minimal impact on pathological and surgical outcomes among our surgeons, who were at the initial stages of their RARP learning curve. Our results suggest that there is no requirement for an active case selection bias against patients with high risk disease for surgeons newly embarking on their RARP learning experience.""","""['A Jaulim', 'A Srinivasan', 'S Hori', 'N Kumar', 'A Y Warren', 'N C Shah', 'V J Gnanapragasam']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Ann R Coll Surg Engl""","""['Superior Biochemical Recurrence and Long-term Quality-of-life Outcomes Are Achievable with Robotic Radical Prostatectomy After a Long Learning Curve-Updated Analysis of a Prospective Single-surgeon Cohort of 2206 Consecutive Cases.', 'Does the experience of the bedside assistant effect the results of robotic surgeons in the learning curve of robot assisted radical prostatectomy?', 'Early outcomes of single-port robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: lessons learned from the learning-curve experience.', 'Methods for training of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Determining the component-based operative time learning curve for robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Effects of robotic and laparoscopic-assisted surgery on lymph node dissection and quality of life in the upper third of gastric cancer: A retrospective cohort study based on propensity score matching.', 'Changing trends in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Inverse stage migration-A retrospective analysis.', 'Learning curves in laparoscopic and robot-assisted prostate surgery: a systematic search and review.', 'A Combined Technology to Protect the Anatomic Integrity of Distal Urethral Sphincter Complex in Radical Prostatectomy Improves Early Urinary Continence Recovery Without Sacrifice of Oncological Outcomes.']"""

The evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of current screening methods has led to conflicting results, which are reflected in some contradictory recommendations proposed by scientific and governmental entities. In this context of uncertainty, our objective is to verify the practices and beliefs of Brazilian physicians of different specialties regarding screening for PC.  Methods:   A cross-sectional study was conducted through a self-administered questionnaire survey during the main events of the target specialties (general practitioner, geriatrics, and urology) during the year 2016. We evaluated the practices on 6 main points of conduct in PC screening: previous discussion to informed decision, exams indicated, age of onset with and without additional risk factors, repeat interval, and age when screening is suspended. Responses were analysed with descriptive statistics and correlation, using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program (IBM SPSS Statistics version 20, 2010).  Results:   The screening recommendation for PC differs significantly among specialists in association with previous discussion of benefits/harm (P = 0.026), exams used (P < 0.001), age of beginning screening with and without additional risk (P < 0.001), and age of suspension of the screening program (P < 0.001).

Here, we delineated the tumour history of seven patients progressing to castration resistance by analysing matched prostate cancer tissues before and after castration. We performed genomic profiling of DNA content-based flow-sorted populations in order to define the different evolutionary patterns. In one patient, we discovered that a catastrophic genomic event, known as chromothripsis, resulted in multiple CRPC tumour populations with distinct, potentially advantageous copy number aberrations, including an amplification of FK506 binding protein 4 (FKBP4, also known as FKBP52), a protein enhancing the transcriptional activity of androgen receptor signalling. Analysis of FKBP4 protein expression in more than 500 prostate cancer samples revealed increased expression in CRPC in comparison to hormone-naïve (HN) PC. Moreover, elevated FKBP4 expression was associated with poor survival of patients with HNPC. We propose FKBP4 amplification and overexpression as a selective advantage in the process of tumour evolution and as a potential mechanism associated with the development of CRPC.

Trends in cancer incidence for males and females and trends in waste gas emissions for the total waste gas, industrial waste gas, other waste gas, SO2, and soot were investigated between 1983 and 2010 in Shanghai, China. Regression models after adjusting for confounding variables were constructed to estimate associations between waste gas emissions and multiple cancer incidences in the whole group and stratified by sex, Engel coefficient, life expectancy, and number of doctors per 10,000 populations to further explore whether changes of waste gas emissions were associated with multiple cancer incidences. More than 550,000 new cancer patients were enrolled and reviewed. Upward trends in multiple cancer incidences for males and females and in waste gas emissions were observed from 1983 to 2010 in Shanghai, China. Waste gas emissions came mainly from industrial waste gas. Waste gas emissions was significantly positively associated with cancer incidence of salivary gland, small intestine, colorectal, anus, gallbladder, thoracic organs, connective and soft tissue, prostate, kidney, bladder, thyroid, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, lymphatic leukemia, myeloid leukemia, and other unspecified sites (all p < 0.05). Negative association between waste gas emissions and the esophagus cancer incidence was observed (p < 0.05).

This minireview compiles the epidemiological findings published to date on the role of flavonoids in prostate tumorigenesis, discusses the reasons of inconsistencies and elicits the promising results for chemoprevention of this malignancy. Long-term consumption of high doses of soy isoflavones can be the reason of markedly lower clinically detectable prostate cancer incidence among Asian men compared to their counterparts in the Western world. The ability to metabolize daidzein to equol, the most biologically active isoflavone, by the certain intestinal bacteria also seems to contribute to this important health benefit. The increasing incidence rate of prostate cancer related to adoption of westernized lifestyle and dietary habits makes the issue of chemoprevention ever more important and directs the eyes to specific food components in the Eastern diet. If further large-scale epidemiological studies will confirm the protective effects of isoflavones against prostate cancer, this could provide an important way for prostate cancer prevention, as diet is a potentially modifiable factor in our behavioral pattern.""","""['K Sak']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Exp Oncol""","""['Soy product and isoflavone consumption in relation to prostate cancer in Japanese men.', 'Intake of Individual Flavonoids and Risk of Carcinogenesis: Overview of Epidemiological Evidence.', 'Relationship of serum levels and dietary intake of isoflavone, and the novel bacterium Slackia sp. strain NATTS with the risk of prostate cancer: a case-control study among Japanese men.', 'Epidemiological Evidences on Dietary Flavonoids and Breast Cancer Risk: A Narrative Review.', 'Phytoestrogens and prostate cancer risk.', 'Evaluation of Possible Neobavaisoflavone Chemosensitizing Properties towards Doxorubicin and Etoposide in SW1783 Anaplastic Astrocytoma Cells.', 'Multifaceted Pharmacological Potentials of Curcumin, Genistein, and Tanshinone IIA through Proteomic Approaches: An In-Depth Review.', 'Flavonoids Targeting the mTOR Signaling Cascades in Cancer: A Potential Crosstalk in Anti-Breast Cancer Therapy.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Antiproliferative Effects of Natural Chalcones.', 'Flavonoids as Epigenetic Modulators for Prostate Cancer Prevention.']"""

Here, we investigated whether Stat5a/b participates in regulation of double-strand DNA break repair in prostate cancer, and whether Stat5 inhibition may provide a novel strategy to sensitize prostate cancer to radiotherapy.Experimental Design: Stat5a/b regulation of DNA repair in prostate cancer was evaluated by comet and clonogenic survival assays, followed by assays specific to homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair. For HR DNA repair, Stat5a/b regulation of Rad51 and the mechanisms underlying the regulation were investigated in prostate cancer cells, xenograft tumors, and patient-derived prostate cancers ex vivo in 3D explant cultures. Stat5a/b induction of Rad51 and HR DNA repair and responsiveness to radiation were evaluated in vivo in mice bearing prostate cancer xenograft tumors.Results: Stat5a/b is critical for Rad51 expression in prostate cancer via Jak2-dependent mechanisms by inducing Rad51 mRNA levels. Consistent with this, genetic knockdown of Stat5a/b suppressed HR DNA repair while not affecting NHEJ DNA repair. Pharmacologic Stat5a/b inhibition potently sensitized prostate cancer cell lines and prostate cancer tumors to radiation, while not inducing radiation sensitivity in the neighboring tissues.Conclusions: This work introduces a novel concept of a pivotal role of Jak2-Stat5a/b signaling for Rad51 expression and HR DNA repair in prostate cancer. Inhibition of Jak2-Stat5a/b signaling sensitizes prostate cancer to radiation and, therefore, may provide an adjuvant therapy for radiation to reduce radiation-induced damage to the neighboring tissues.

Methods and materials:   770 US monitoring sessions in 38 prostate cancer patients' VMAT treatment series were retrospectively evaluated. Intrafraction motion assessment of the prostate was based on continuous position monitoring with a 4-dimensional US system along the 3 directions: left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and inferior-superior (SI). The overall mean values and standard deviations (SD) along with random and systematic errors were calculated.  Results:   The mean duration of each monitoring session was 254 s. The mean (μ), the systematic error (Σ), and the random error (σ) of intrafraction prostate displacement were μ = (0.01, -0.08, 0.15) mm, Σ = (0.30, 0.34, 0.23) mm, and σ = (0.59, 0.73, 0.64) mm in the LR, AP and SI directions, respectively.

This study assessed whether TRAP exposure is associated with subsequent cancer in a large cohort of coronary patients. Methods & results Consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions in a major medical centre in central Israel from 2004 to 2014 were followed for cancer through 2015. Residential levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) - a proxy for TRAP - were estimated based on a high-resolution national land use regression model. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to study relationships with cancer. Among 12,784 candidate patients, 9816 had available exposure data and no history of cancer (mean age, 68 years; 77% men). During a median (25th-75th percentiles) follow-up of 7.0 (3.9-9.3) years, 773 incident cases of cancer (8%) were diagnosed. In a multivariable-adjusted model, a 10-ppb increase in mean NOx exposure was associated with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.15) for all-site cancer and 1.16 (95% CI 1.05-1.28) for cancers previously linked to TRAP (lung, breast, prostate, kidney and bladder). A stronger association was observed for breast cancer (HR = 1.43; 95% CI 1.12-1.83). Associations were slightly strengthened after limiting the cohort to patients with more precise exposure assessment.

Further, a molecular docking study for compound 5a was performed to verify the binding mode towards the EGFR and CDK4/cyclin D1 kinases.""","""['Heba S A Elzahabi', 'Eman S Nossier', 'Nagy M Khalifa', 'Rania A Alasfoury', 'May A El-Manawaty']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem""","""['Synthesis, EGFR Inhibition and Anti-cancer Activity of New 3,6-dimethyl-1-phenyl-4-(substituted-methoxy)pyrazolo3,4-d pyrimidine Derivatives.', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibition effects of novel Pyrazolo1,5-apyrimidines and Pyrido2,3-dpyrimidines ligand: Synthesis, biological screening and molecular modeling studies.', 'Synthesis and anticancer activity of some pyrido2,3-dpyrimidine derivatives as apoptosis inducers and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.', 'An overview on synthetic and pharmaceutical prospective of pyrido2,3-dpyrimidines scaffold.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (cdk4/6) inhibitors: perspectives in cancer therapy and imaging.', 'Nitrogen Containing Heterocycles as Anticancer Agents: A Medicinal Chemistry Perspective.', 'Medicinal chemistry perspective of pyrido2,3-dpyrimidines as anticancer agents.', 'Design, synthesis, and anti-cancer evaluation of new pyrido2,3-dpyrimidin-4(3H)-one derivatives as potential EGFRWT and EGFRT790M inhibitors and apoptosis inducers.', 'A Review on Fused Pyrimidine Systems as EGFR Inhibitors and Their Structure-Activity Relationship.', 'Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of New Pyridothienopyrimidine Derivatives as Antibacterial Agents and Escherichia coli Topoisomerase II Inhibitors.']"""
