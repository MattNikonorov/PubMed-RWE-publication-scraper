To more clearly define the mechanism(s) involved in prostate cancer cell migration, we undertook a series of studies utilizing non-malignant prostate epithelial cells RWPE1 and prostate cancer DU145 and PC3 cells. Our studies show that increased cell migration was observed in prostate cancer cells, which was mediated through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Importantly, addition of Mg2+ , but not Ca2+ , increased cell migration. Furthermore, TRPM7 expression, which functions as an Mg2+ influx channel, was also increased in prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of TRPM7 currents by 2-APB, significantly blocked cell migration in both DU145 and PC3 cells. Addition of growth factor TGFβ showed a further increase in cell migration, which was again blocked by the addition of 2-APB. Importantly, TGFβ addition also significantly increased TRPM7 expression and function, and silencing of TRPM7 negated TGFβ-induced cell migration along with a decrease in EMT markers showing loss of cell adhesion. Furthermore, resveratrol, which decreases prostate cancer cell migration, inhibited TRPM7 expression and function including TGFβ-induced cell migration and activation of TRPM7 function. Together, these results suggest that Mg2+ influx via TRPM7 promotes cell migration by inducing EMT in prostate cancer cells and resveratrol negatively modulates TRPM7 function thereby inhibiting prostate cancer metastasis.""","""['Yuyang Sun', 'Anne Schaar', 'Pramod Sukumaran', 'Archana Dhasarathy', 'Brij B Singh']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Downregulation of TRPM7 suppressed migration and invasion by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells.', 'Suppression of TRPM7 Inhibited Hypoxia-Induced Migration and Invasion of Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells by Enhancing RACK1-Mediated Degradation of HIF-1α.', 'TRPC1-STIM1 activation modulates transforming growth factor β-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.', 'TRPM7 and its role in neurodegenerative diseases.', 'Role of TRPM7 kinase in cancer.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'On the modulation of TRPM channels: Current perspectives and anticancer therapeutic implications.', 'The Role οf Ion Channels in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical and Clinical Research Models of Prostate Cancer: A Brief Overview.', 'EWI2 prevents EGFR from clustering and endocytosis to reduce tumor cell movement and proliferation.']"""

By using non-selective culture plates, instead of commonly used ciprofloxacin (CIP)-containing plates, we analyzed the association between Escherichia coli CIP minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and post-biopsy infectious complications. A pre-biopsy rectal swab was taken from 207 consecutive men, scheduled for transrectal 12-core prostate biopsy with CIP 750 mg as the mostly used prophylaxis. CIP MIC of rectal Gram-negative bacilli was determined from a chromogenic agar. Rectal E. coli were categorized to resistant (R) and intermediate (I) isolates together (R + I, MIC > 0.25 mg/l) and to sensitive (S, MIC ≤ 0.25 mg/l) using EUCAST clinical breakpoints. In addition, epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF R, MIC > 0.064 mg/l) was used for categorization. Eighteen (8.7%) men showed CIP R + I E. coli by the EUCAST breakpoints and 41 (19.8%) using the ECOFF R criteria. During follow-up, 15 (7.2%) men had infectious symptoms, of which 9 (4.3%) were culture-confirmed infections. Only 4 (26.7%) of these 15 patients showed R + I E. coli in the rectal swab according to EUCAST, but 10 (66.7%) using the ECOFF cutoff. Rectal E. coli CIP R + I by the EUCAST clinical breakpoints associated with infectious complications with OR 5.7 (95% CI 1.5-21.8, P = 0.005) and ECOFF R E. coli by OR 10.7 (95% CI 3.0-37.6, P < 0.001). Men carrying rectal E. coli with moderately lowered CIP susceptibility (MIC > ECOFF 0.064 mg/l) were identified and, interestingly, they showed a high risk of developing infectious symptoms after the biopsy. This explains why some men develop infectious complications despite appropriate antibiotics before prostatic biopsies.

No association was observed between PTEN-status and RAD51 expression either in-vitro or in-vivo in a tissue microarray of 1500 PTEN-deficient prostate cancer (PC) samples. PTEN depletion and sustained activation of AKT sequestered CHK1 in the cytoplasm, thus impairing the G2/M-checkpoint after irradiation. Consistently, AKT inhibition recovered the G2/M-checkpoint and restored HR efficiency in PTEN-depleted cells. We show that, although PTEN loss correlates with a worse prognosis, it may predict for improved response of PC patients to radiotherapy. Further, we provide evidence for the use of PTEN as a biomarker for predicting the response to PARP inhibitors as radiosensitizing agents in prostate cancer. Collectively, these data implicate PTEN in maintaining genomic stability by delaying G2/M-phase progression of damaged cells, thus allowing time for DSB repair by HR.

Objective:   To clinically qualify baseline and on-treatment cell-free DNA (cfDNA) concentrations as biomarkers of patient outcome following taxane chemotherapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Blood for cfDNA analyses was prospectively collected from 571 mCRPC patients participating in two phase III clinical trials, FIRSTANA (NCT01308567) and PROSELICA (NCT01308580). Patients received docetaxel (75mg/m2) or cabazitaxel (20 or 25mg/m2) as first-line chemotherapy (FIRSTANA), and cabazitaxel (20 or 25mg/m2) as second-line chemotherapy (PROSELICA).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Associations between cfDNA concentration and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response were tested using logistic regression models. Survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods for cfDNA concentration grouped by quartile. Cox proportional hazard models, within each study, tested for associations with radiological progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS), with multivariable analyses adjusting for baseline prognostic variables. Two-stage individual patient meta-analysis combined results for cfDNA concentrations for both studies.  Results and limitations:   In 2502 samples, baseline log10 cfDNA concentration correlated with known prognostic factors, shorter rPFS (hazard ratio [HR]=1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.08; p=0.004), and shorter OS on taxane therapy (HR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.18-1.97; p=0.001). In multivariable analyses, baseline cfDNA concentration was an independent prognostic variable for rPFS and OS in both first- and second-line chemotherapy settings. Patients with a PSA response experienced a decline in log10 cfDNA concentrations during the first four cycles of treatment (per cycle -0.03; 95% CI: -0.044 to -0.009; p=0.003). Study limitations included the fact that blood sample collection was not mandated for all patients and the inability to specifically quantitate tumour-derived cfDNA fraction in cfDNA.  Conclusions:   We report that changes in cfDNA concentrations correlate with both rPFS and OS in patients receiving first- and second-line taxane therapy, and may serve as independent prognostic biomarkers of response to taxanes.  Patient summary:   In the past decade, several new therapies have been introduced for men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. Although metastatic prostate cancer remains incurable, these novel agents have extended patient survival and improved their quality of life in comparison with the last decade. To further optimise treatment allocation and individualise patient care, better tests (biomarkers) are needed to guide the delivery of improved and more precise care. In this report, we assessed cfDNA in over 2500 blood samples from men with prostate cancer who were recruited to two separate international studies and received taxane chemotherapy. We quantified the concentration of cfDNA fragments in blood plasma, which partly originates from tumour. We identified that higher concentrations of circulating cfDNA fragments, prior to starting taxane chemotherapy, can be used to identify patients with aggressive prostate cancer. A decline in cfDNA concentration during the first 3-9 wk after initiation of taxane therapy was seen in patients deriving benefit from taxane chemotherapy. These results identified circulating cfDNA as a new biomarker of aggressive disease in metastatic prostate cancer and imply that the study of cfDNA has clinical utility, supporting further efforts to develop blood-based tests on this circulating tumour-derived DNA.""","""['Niven Mehra', 'David Dolling', 'Semini Sumanasuriya', 'Rossitza Christova', 'Lorna Pope', 'Suzanne Carreira', 'George Seed', 'Wei Yuan', 'Jane Goodall', 'Emma Hall', 'Penny Flohr', 'Gunther Boysen', 'Diletta Bianchini', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Mario A Eisenberger', 'Karim Fizazi', 'Stephane Oudard', 'Mustapha Chadjaa', 'Sandrine Macé', 'Johann S de Bono']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Cell-free DNA in Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Biomarker Revolution Under Way?', 'Re: Niven Mehra, David Dolling, Semini Sumanasuriya, et al.

The immunosensor was fabricated by sequential immobilization of anti-PSA primary antibody, PSA antigen and HRP-tagged secondary antibody on the surface of AuNPs/CHI/SPE. When this immunosensor was placed in 2.5mM H2O2, as HRP substrate, and 1mM methylene blue (MB), as redox mediator, greatly amplified immunosensing signals were observed. Immunosensing signals for the reduction of H2O2 were monitored in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) by CV and square wave voltammetry (SWV). Under optimized conditions steady state current increased linearly with PSA concentration over the range 1-18ng/ml with a detection limit of 0.001ng/ml. The fabricated immunosensor demonstrated excellent sensitivity, stability and reproducibility and therefore was successfully applied to analyse PSA in biological samples.

Radiotherapy with dose escalation to the former prostate bed has been associated with improved biochemical recurrence-free survival. Thus, it can be hypothesised that PSMA PET/CT-based radiotherapy might improve the prognosis of these patients.  Methods:   One hundred twenty-nine patients underwent PSMA PET/CT due to biochemical persistence (52%) or recurrence (48%) after radical prostatectomy without evidence of distant metastases (February 2014-May 2017) and received PSMA PET/CT-based radiotherapy. Biochemical recurrence free survival (PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/ml) was defined as the study endpoint.  Results:   Patients with biochemical persistence were significantly more often high-risk patients with significantly shorter time interval before PSMA PET/CT than patients with biochemical recurrence. Patients with biochemical recurrence had significantly more often no evidence of disease or local recurrence only in PSMA PET/CT, whereas patients with biochemical persistence had significantly more often lymph node involvement. Seventy-three patients were started on antiandrogen therapy prior to radiotherapy due to macroscopic disease in PSMA PET/CT. Cumulatively, 70 (66-70.6) Gy was delivered to local macroscopic tumor, 66 (63-66) Gy to the prostate fossa, 61.6 (53.2-66) Gy to PET-positive lymph nodes and 50.4 (45-52.3) Gy to lymphatic pathways. Median PSA after radiotherapy was 0.07 ng/ml with 74% of patients having a PSA ≤ 0.1 ng/ml. After a median follow-up of 20 months, median PSA was 0.07 ng/ml with ongoing antiandrogen therapy in 30 patients. PET-positive patients without antiandrogen therapy at last follow-up (45 patients) had a median PSA of 0.05 ng/ml with 89% of all patients, 94% of patients with biochemical recurrence and 82% of patients with biochemical persistence having a PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/ml. Post-radiotherapy PSA ≤ 0.1 ng/ml and biochemical recurrence vs. persistence were significantly associated with a PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/ml at last follow-up.

The authors investigated whether prostate-directed treatment with either surgery or radiotherapy versus conservative treatment in the setting of locally advanced or metastatic disease was associated with improved survival within a cohort of men from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Breast and Prostate Cancer Data Quality and Patterns of Care Study (CDC POC-BP).  Methods:   Men diagnosed with locally advanced (cT3-T4 or N+ and M0) or metastatic prostate cancer were identified. The authors compared survival by treatment type, categorized as conservative (androgen deprivation therapy only) versus aggressive (radical prostatectomy or any type of radiotherapy). Nine-year overall survival and prostate cancer-specific survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine factors independently associated with 9-year prostate cancer-specific survival.  Results:   For men with advanced, nonmetastatic prostate cancer, conservative treatment alone was associated with a 4 times higher likelihood of prostate cancer mortality compared with men treated with surgery (hazard ratio, 4.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-12.14). In contrast, no difference was found between conservative versus aggressive treatment after adjusting for covariates for men with metastatic disease. The 9-year prostate cancer-specific survival rate was 27% for those receiving aggressive treatment versus 24% for men undergoing conservative treatment.  Conclusions:   The authors did not observe a survival advantage with local therapy in addition to standard androgen deprivation therapy for men with metastatic prostate cancer.

Injections of radioactive LDR gold nanoparticles (LDR Au NPs), instead of conventional millimeter-size radioactive seeds surrounded by Au NPs, could further enhance the dose by distributing the radioactivity more precisely and homogeneously in tumors. However, the potential of LDR Au NPs as an emerging strategy to treat cancer is strongly dependent on the macroscopic diffusion of the NPs in tumors, as well as on their microscopic internalization within the cells. Understanding the relationship between interstitial and intracellular distribution of NPs, and the outcomes of dose deposition in the cancer tissue is essential for considering future applications of radioactive Au NPs in oncology. Here, LDR Au NPs (103Pd:Pd@Au-PEG NPs) were injected in prostate cancer tumors. The particles were visualized at time-points by computed tomography imaging ( in vivo), transmission electron microscopy ( ex vivo), and optical microscopy ( ex vivo). These data were used in a Monte Carlo-based dosimetric model to reveal the dose deposition produced by LDR Au NPs both at tumoral and cellular scales. 103Pd:Pd@Au-PEG NPs injected in tumors produce a strong dose enhancement at the intracellular level. However, energy deposition is mainly confined around vesicles filled with NPs, and not necessarily close to the nuclei. This suggests that indirect damage caused by the production of reactive oxygen species might be the leading therapeutic mechanism of tumor growth control, over direct damage to the DNA.""","""['Myriam Laprise-Pelletier', 'Yunzhi Ma', 'Jean Lagueux', 'Marie-France Côté', 'Luc Beaulieu', 'Marc-André Fortin']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""ACS Nano""","""['Low-Dose Prostate Cancer Brachytherapy with Radioactive Palladium-Gold Nanoparticles.', 'In silico dosimetry of low-dose rate brachytherapy using radioactive nanoparticles.', 'Monte Carlo simulation of radiation transport and dose deposition from locally released gold nanoparticles labeled with 111In, 177Lu or 90Y incorporated into tissue implantable depots.', 'Monte Carlo simulation of gold nanoparticles for X-ray enhancement application.', 'Gold Nanoparticles in Radiotherapy and Recent Progress in Nanobrachytherapy.', 'Versatile magnetic microdiscs for the radio enhancement and mechanical disruption of glioblastoma cancer cells.', 'Recent Advances in Brachytherapy Using Radioactive Nanoparticles: An Alternative to Seed-Based Brachytherapy.', 'Preclinical evaluation of cationic DOTA-triarginine-lipid conjugates for theranostic liquid brachytherapy.', 'Improving nanotherapy delivery and action through image-guided systems pharmacology.']"""

What's more, SET7 is involved inthe pathogenesis of alopecia aerate, breast cancer, tumor and cancer progression, atherosclerosis in human carotid plaques, chronic renal diseases, diabetes, obesity, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, there is urgent need to develop novel SET7 inhibitors. In this paper, based on DC-S239 which has been previously reported in our group, we employed scaffold hopping- and 2D fingerprint-based similarity searches and identified DC-S285 as the new hit compound targeting SET7 (IC50 = 9.3 μM). Both radioactive tracing and NMR experiments validated the interactions between DC-S285 and SET7 followed by the second-round similarity search leading to the identification ofDC-S303 with the IC50 value of 1.1 μM. In cellular level, DC-S285 retarded tumor cell proliferation and showed selectivity against MCF7 (IC50 = 21.4 μM), Jurkat (IC50 = 2.2 μM), THP1 (IC50 = 3.5 μM), U937 (IC50 = 3.9 μM) cell lines. Docking calculations suggested that DC-S303 share similar binding mode with the parent compoundDC-S239. What's more, it presented good selectivity against other epigenetic targets, including SETD1B, SETD8, G9a, SMYD2 and EZH2. DC-S303 can serve as a drug-like scaffold which may need further optimization for drug development, and can be used as chemical probe to help the community to better understand the SET7 biology.""","""['Hong Ding', 'Wen Chao Lu', 'Jun Chi Hu', 'Yu-Chih Liu', 'Chen Hua Zhang', 'Fu Lin Lian', 'Nai Xia Zhang', 'Fan Wang Meng', 'Cheng Luo', 'Kai Xian Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Discovery and Optimization of Novel, Selective Histone Methyltransferase SET7 Inhibitors by Pharmacophore- and Docking-Based Virtual Screening.', 'Lead discovery, chemical optimization, and biological evaluation studies of novel histone methyltransferase SET7 small-molecule inhibitors.', 'Computational discovery and biological evaluation of novel inhibitors targeting histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SET7.', 'Non-histone Methylation of SET7/9 and its Biological Functions.', 'Progress in the Development of Lysine Methyltransferase SETD8 Inhibitors.', 'A Systematic Review to Define the Multi-Faceted Role of Lysine Methyltransferase SETD7 in Cancer.', 'Ranunculus ternatus Thunb extract attenuates renal fibrosis of diabetic nephropathy via inhibiting SMYD2.']"""

However, evidence according to the associations between obesity and metastases-free survival after radical prostatectomy (RP) is still inconsistent.  Methods:   We relied on PCa patients treated with RP at the Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center between 2004 and 2015. First, multivariable Cox regression analyses examined the impact of obesity on metastases after RP. Last, in a propensity score matched cohort, Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed metastases-free survival according to body mass index (kg/m2) (BMI) strata (≥ 30 vs. < 25).  Results:   Of 13,667 individuals, 1990 (14.6%) men were obese (BMI ≥ 30). Median follow-up was 36.4 month (IQR 13.3-60.8). Obese patients were less likely to exhibit metastases after RP (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.97, p = 0.03). Similarly, after propensity score adjustment, obesity was associated with increased metastases-free survival (log rank p = 0.001).  Conclusion:   We recorded the obesity paradox phenomenon in PCa patients. In particular, high BMI (≥ 30) was associated with decreased risk of metastases after RP, despite an increased risk being anticipated. Whether statin use might have affected the results was not assessed.

Methods:   Assessed 2424 prostate biopsy cores and corresponding RP of 202 patients submitted to the first set of 12 cores prostate biopsy between 2010 and 2015. Analyzed biopsy core length, age, prostate volume (PV), free and total PSA ratio, PSA density, RP index tumor clinical significance, extension, localization, surgical margins, and cancer control. Prostate biopsy confronted to surgical specimens defined Gleason grade-grouping system (1-5) agreement.  Results:   Median age was 63.7 years, PSA 10.1 ng/dl, PSA density 28%, and mean follow-up 5 years.

Methods:   A total of 636 patients who underwent repeat prostate biopsy were included. The patients were divided into two groups according to the repeat biopsy results (with vs. without prostate cancer). A multivariable analysis was performed to assess the predictors for the detection of prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 98 patients (15.4%). Although there was no difference in the prostate-specific antigen velocity, the prostate-specific antigen density was higher in the patients with prostate cancer at the initial (0.14 vs. 0.17 ng/mL/cc, p = 0.049) and repeat biopsies (0.17 vs. 0.26 ng/mL/cc, p < 0.001). The proportions of the patients who met the active surveillance criteria were as follows: 22.4% (Johns Hopkins), 30.6% (University of Toronto), 32.7% (University of California at San Francisco), 30.6% (Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance), 27.6% (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center), and 13.3% (University of Miami). In the multivariable analysis, age, hypoechoic lesion on trans-rectal ultrasonography, and prostate-specific antigen density at the repeat biopsy were the significant predictors for prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Trans-rectal ultrasonography before repeat prostate biopsy and the prostate-specific antigen density are useful for selecting patients with a high probability for prostate cancer if repeat trans-rectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy is considered.

The aim of this evaluation was to further analyze such LN.  Methods:   Two patient groups with biphasic 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT at 1 h and 3 h p.i. were included in this retrospective evaluation. Group A (n = 38) included patients without LN metastases, and group B (n = 43) patients with LN metastases of PC. SUV of mediastinal/paraaortal LN of group A (n = 100) were compared to SUV of LN metastases of group B (n = 91). Additionally, 22 randomly selected mediastinal and paraaortal LN of patients without PC were immunohistochemically (IHC) analyzed for PSMA expression.  Results:   In group A, 7/38 patients (18.4%) presented with at least one PSMA-positive mediastinal LN at 1 h p.i. and 3/38 (7.9%) positive LN at 3 h p.i. with a SUVmax of 2.3 ± 0.7 at 1 h p.i.

SUVmax of LN-metastases was 12.5 ± 13.2 at 1 h p.i. (15.8 ± 17.0 at 3 h p.i.). SUVmax increased clearly (> 10%) between 1 h and 3 h p.i. in 76.9% of the LN metastases, and decreased significantly in 72.7% of the mediastinal/paraaortal LN.

Expression was stronger in mediastinal nodes (p = 0.038) and when follicular hyperplasia was present (p = 0.050).  Conclusion:   PSMA-positive mediastinal/paraaortal benign LN were visible in a notable proportion of patients.

Further, under hypoxia, Rab5 (a biomarker for early endosome) was clustered in perinuclear region; and CD63 (a biomarker for exosomes and multivesicular endosomes) showed greater co-localization with actin cytoskeleton especially in African American PCa cells. Importantly, exosome biogenesis inhibitors GW4869 (10-20 µM) or DMA (10-20 µg/ml) significantly decreased cell viability and clonogenicity in PCa cells.

Results: Uptake in suspected lesions did not differ between the cohorts. 18F-DCFPyL uptake in the submandibular gland, liver, and spleen was significantly higher in the fasting than the nonfasting cohort. Conclusion: Our data show that fasting does not significantly affect 18F-DCFPyL uptake in suspected malignant lesions but does result in significantly lower 18F-DCFPyL uptake in tissues with high physiologic uptake.

Methods and materials:   In the years 2000-2003, 295 patients were treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT; n = 135; 70.2 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions), low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT with I-125; n = 94; 145 Gy), and high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT with Ir-192; n = 66; 18 Gy in two fractions using 4-6 needles) as a boost to EBRT (50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions). Quality of life was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite at median time of 2, 6, and 10 years after treatment.  Results:   The urinary function score 2 years after EBRT (mean 93 points) was significantly higher in comparison to HDR-BT + EBRT (80 points, higher doses to the urethra relevant) and LDR-BT (88 points). After 10 years, only HDR-BT + EBRT (75 points) remained worse (LDR-BT 92 points; EBRT 91 points). Urinary incontinence score decreased from 83 to 76 points in the HDR-BT + EBRT group. No significant differences or changes resulted in the bowel domain. The mean sexual function score (i.e., sexuality score) was significantly higher after LDR-BT versus HDR-BT + EBRT and EBRT (30 vs. 19 and 24 points after 2 years and 25 vs. 13 and 15 points after 10 years, respectively)-a lower patient age and a lower percentage with hormonal treatment need to be considered.  Conclusion:   Apart from decreasing sexual function for all patients, decreasing urinary scores were found in the HDR-BT + EBRT group predominantly as a result of increasing incontinence.

Material and methods:   The study includes 623 patients, median age of 66 years, treated from 1995 to 2008 and a median follow up of 11 years (range 2-266 months). Androgen deprivation therapy was given to 429 patients (69%). The HDR-BT was given with two 10 Gy fractions and the EBRT with 2 Gy fractions to 50 Gy.  Results:   The 10-year PC-specific survival was 100%, 92%, 91%, and 75% for low-, intermediate-, high- and very high-risk patients respectively, and the 10-year probability of PSA relapse was 0%, 21%, 33%, and 65% respectively. The 10-year actuarial prevalence for ≥grade 2 GU- and GI-toxicities were 28% and 12% respectively and for ≥grade 3, 4% and 1% respectively. Urethral stricture was the most frequent GU complication with a 10-year actuarial incidence of 10%. Treatment without dose constraints for the urethra conferred a higher incidence 18%, compared to 5% after 2003 (p < 0.001). Sixteen patients experienced grade 4 GU toxicity, of which 13 were treated before 2003. No grade 4 rectal toxicity was seen.

Moreover, we showed that miR-30c overexpression suppressed the migration and invasion of GBM cells. Mechanistically, we found that SOX9 was a direct target of miR-30c in GBM cells. Overexpression of miR-30c inhibited the mRNA and protein levels of SOX9 in GBM cells. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between the expression of miR-30c and SOX9 in GBM tissues. Finally, we showed that restoration of SOX9 in GBM cells reversed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of GBM cells transfected with miR-30c mimic.

The invasion and migration was evaluated by modified Boyden chamber assay, scratch assay, gelatin zymography, Real Time qPCR (RTqPCR) and Western blot. The involvement of ERs was evaluated with the selective ER antagonists: estrogen receptor α (ERα) antagonist 1,3-bis (4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-[4-(2-piperidinylethoxy) phenol]-1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride (MPP) and estrogen receptor β (ERβ) antagonist 4-[2-phenyl-5,7-bis (trifluoromethyl) pyrazolo [1,5-a]-pyrimidin-3-yl] phenol (PHTPP). ZEA was found to modulate cell motility dependent on estrogen receptors, particularly ERα. Increased cell migration and invasion were associated with increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity as well as the up-regulation of the EMT-associated genes vimentin (VIM), zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1/2 (ZEB1/2) and transforming growth factor β 1 (TGFβ1).

Single-cell genome analysis has gained interest in latest years as a source of biomarkers for targeted-therapy selection and drug resistance, and several methods have been developed to amplify the genomic DNA and to produce libraries suitable for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). However, most protocols require several enzymatic and cleanup steps, thus increasing the complexity and length of protocols, while robustness and speed are key factors for clinical applications. To tackle this issue, we developed a single-tube, single-step, streamlined protocol, exploiting ligation mediated PCR (LM-PCR) Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) method, for low-pass genome sequencing with the Ion Torrent™ platform and copy number alterations (CNAs) calling from single cells. The method was evaluated on single cells isolated from 6 aberrant cell lines of the NCI-H series. In addition, to demonstrate the feasibility of the workflow on clinical samples, we analyzed single circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and white blood cells (WBCs) isolated from the blood of patients affected by prostate cancer or lung adenocarcinoma. The results obtained show that the developed workflow generates data accurately representing whole genome absolute copy number profiles of single cell and allows alterations calling at resolutions down to 100 Kbp with as few as 200,000 reads.

Our study uses one of the largest Canadian worker cohorts to examine occupation, industry, and prostate cancer and to assess patterns of prostate cancer rates. The Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC) was established by linking the 1991 Canadian Census Cohort to the Canadian Cancer Database (1969-2010), Canadian Mortality Database (1991-2011), and Tax Summary Files (1981-2011). A total of 37,695 prostate cancer cases were identified in men aged 25-74 based on age at diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazards ratios and 95% confidence intervals. In men aged 25-74 years, elevated risks were observed in the following occupations: senior management (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.20); office and administration (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.11-1.27); finance services (HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04-1.14); education (HR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00-1.11); agriculture and farm management (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.06-1.17); farm work (HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.21); construction managers (HR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01-1.14); firefighting (HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01-1.36); and police work (HR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.09-1.36). Decreased risks were observed across other construction and transportation occupations. Results by industry were consistent with occupation results.

Cabazitaxel at a dose of 20-25 mg/m² was administered every 3 or 4 weeks. Clinicopathological factors and laboratory data were collected to assess the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). An upfront dose-reduction was required in 52.5% of patients due to their reduced general condition or advanced age. Prophylactic G-CSF was prescribed to all the patients. Grade ≥3 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia occurred in 21 patients (53.6%) and 3 patients (6.8%), respectively. Treatment was generally well tolerated, with a median of 5 cycles (range 1-17).

Thus, the development of novel approaches that affect cancer cell-specific metabolic pathways is needed. Since much evidence has shown that tumor cell proliferation and motility are stimulated by glutamate via activation of its receptors, use of antagonists to these receptors may be the key to control cancer cell progression. Riluzole noncompetitive metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) antagonist, commonly used to treat patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), has shown some antineoplastic properties against melanoma, breast and prostate cancer. Yet little is known about its molecular mode of action.  Aims:   The current study aims at evaluating the abilities of Riluzole to inhibit proliferation of several cancer cell lines, as well as resolve the mechanism of its action.  Method:   We demonstrated antiproliferative and antimigrative properties of Riluzole in rhabdomyosarcomamedulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, astrocytoma, glioma, colon cancer, lung cancer, thyroid carcinoma, leukemia, erythroleukemia and multiple myeloma. Our studies revealed apoptosis induction and G2-M cell cycle arrest in Riluzole treated A549, C6 and HT-29 cells.  Result:   At the molecular level, we found that these cells treated with Riluzole had a decrease of Cyclin B and an increase of p21 Waf1/Cip1 and p53 expression. We also observed an enhancement of CDK1 and Chk2 phosphorylation. Reported changes may suggest the involvement of these proteins in G2-M arrest, observed in flow cytometry analysis.

We present a pure laparoscopic execution.  Presentation:   A 61-year-old male patient with a diagnosis of prostate cancer, with PSA 6.54ng/ml, DRE: T1C and Gleason 6 (3+3) 1/12 fragments. All therapeutic possibilities were discussed, including active surveillance. The patient opted for surgical treatment. A transperitoneal technique was used. We started the dissection on the left side, in the limit between the detrusor and the base of the prostate. The left seminal vesicle was dissected and left neurovascular bundle released by a high anterior dissection. We repeated the same procedure on the right side. The urethra was then divided, prostatic apex was laterally drawn and PVC was released. The bladder neck was divided and an urethrovesical anastomosis was achieved. A pelvic drain was placed.  Results:   The total operative time was 150 minutes. The estimated blood loss was 300mL. The drain was removed on the 1st postoperative day and the patient was discharged. The Foley catheter was removed after 7 days and the patient remained completely dry. Hystopathology revealed adenocarcinoma Gleason 6, negative margins. PSA after 30 days was <0.04ng/mL, and the patient reported partial penile erection.

Also, its potential to induce autophagy has been established. Unfolded protein responses and starvation of amino acids are known to trigger autophagy. As yet, however, the molecular mechanism underlying PA deficiency-induced autophagy is not fully clarified. Here, we aimed to determine the apoptotic effect of DENSpm after autophagy inhibition by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or siRNA-mediated Beclin-1 silencing in colon cancer cells.  Methods:   The apoptotic effects of DENSpm after 3-MA treatment or Beclin-1 silencing were determined by PI and AnnexinV/PI staining in conjunction with flow cytometry. Intracellular PA levels were measured by HPLC, whereas autophagy and the expression profiles of PA key players were determined in HCT116, SW480 and HT29 colon cancer cells by Western blotting.  Results:   We found that DENSpm-induced autophagy was inhibited by 3-MA treatment and Beclin-1 silencing, and that apoptotic cell death was increased by PA depletion and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) upregulation. We also found that autophagy inhibition led to DENSpm-induced apoptosis through Atg5 down-regulation, p62 degradation and LC3 lipidation in both HCT116 and SW480 cells. p53 deficiency did not alter the response of the colon cancer cells to DENSpm-induced apoptotic cell death under autophagy suppression conditions.

FCH PET/CT consisted in a dual phase: early pelvic list-mode acquisition (from 0 to10 min post-injection) and late whole-body acquisition (60 min post-injection).

This occurs despite controversy in the West and data suggesting association with adverse effects, notably cardiovascular events. We therefore sought to assess the impact of pADT on all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) in Asian men with high-risk and unfavourable intermediate-risk PCa.  Methods:   With cancer registry data, men from a single centre in Singapore with clinically localised high-risk/unfavourable intermediate-risk PCa diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 and either treated conservatively with no therapy or started on pADT within 1 year of diagnosis were followed up through January 2017. Patients with non-localised PCa (clinical stage T4, regional/distant lymph node involvement, metastases), or receipt of local therapy (radical prostatectomy/radiotherapy) were excluded. The primary outcomes of all-cause mortality and PCSM were analysed with Cox proportional hazards regression models.  Results:   Three hundred and forty Asian men were analysed, and 177 (52.1%) were started on pADT, with mean age of 77 (49-98) years. There were 119 deaths in the cohort, and 68 (38.4%) occurred in patients treated with pADT (median follow-up, 4.4 years). After adjusting for comorbidities and clinical characteristics, pADT did not provide benefit to all-cause mortality, PCSM or cardiovascular mortality.

We prospectively evaluated 50 PCa patients with biochemical relapse after surgery or external beam radiation therapy. All patients underwent 64CuCl2-PET/CT to detect PCa recurrence/metastases. Volumes of interest were manually drawn for each 64CuCl2 avid PCa lesion with a diameter > 1 cm on mpMRI in each patient. Time-activity curves for all lesions were obtained. The effective and biological half-life and the standard uptake values (SUVs) were calculated. Tumour/background ratio (TBR) curves as a function of time were considered. Finally, the absorbed dose per lesion was estimated.  Results:   The mean effective half-life of 64CuCl2 calculated in the lymph nodes (10.2 ± 1.7 h) was significantly higher than in local relapses (8.8 ± 1.1 h) and similar to that seen in bone metastases (9.0 ± 0.4 h). The mean 64CuCl2 SUVmax calculated 1 h after tracer injection was significantly higher in the lymph nodes (6.8 ± 4.3) and bone metastases (6.8 ± 2.9) than in local relapses (4.7 ± 2.4). TBR mean curve of 64CuCl2 revealed that the calculated TBRmax value was 5.0, 7.0, and 6.2 in local relapse and lymph node and bone metastases, respectively, and it was achieved about 1 h after 64CuCl2 injection. The mean absorbed dose of the PCa lesions per administrated activity was 6.00E-2 ± 4.74E-2mGy/MBq. Indeed, for an administered activity of 3.7 GBq, the mean dose absorbed by the lesion would be 0.22 Gy.  Conclusions:   Dosimetry showed that the dose absorbed by PCa recurrences/metastases per administrated activity was low. The dosimetric study performed does not take into account the possible therapeutic effect of the Auger electrons. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate 64Cu internalization in the cell nucleus that seems related to the therapeutic effectiveness reported in preclinical studies.""","""['Sergio Righi', 'Martina Ugolini', 'Gianluca Bottoni', 'Matteo Puntoni', 'Massimiliano Iacozzi', 'Francesco Paparo', 'Manlio Cabria', 'Luca Ceriani', 'Monica Gambaro', 'Luca Giovanella', 'Arnoldo Piccardo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['Targeting Copper in Cancer Imaging and Therapy: A New Theragnostic Agent.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '64CuCl2 PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Relapse.', 'A feasibility study of the therapeutic application of a mixture of 67/64 Cu radioisotopes produced by cyclotrons with proton irradiation.', 'Recent Advances in Cancer Imaging with 64CuCl2 PET/CT.', 'An Overview of In Vitro Assays of 64Cu-, 68Ga-, 125I-, and 99mTc-Labelled Radiopharmaceuticals Using Radiometric Counters in the Era of Radiotheranostics.', 'Targeting Copper in Cancer Imaging and Therapy: A New Theragnostic Agent.', 'Imaging zinc trafficking in vivo by positron emission tomography with zinc-62.', 'Diagnostic and Dosimetry Features of 64CuCuCl2 in High-Grade Paediatric Infiltrative Gliomas.', 'Translational immunoPET imaging using a radiolabeled GD2-specific antibody in neuroblastoma.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of 217 RP patients (2009-2016) with preoperative MRI (almost all in external institutions) and fulfillment of different FT eligibility criteria: unilateral tumor, clinical tumor stage ≤ cT2a, prostate volume ≤ 60 mL and either biopsy Gleason 3 + 3 or ≤ 3 + 4 and PSA ≤ 10 or ≤ 15 ng/mL. Multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVA) assessed the role of MRI to predict the presence of significant contralateral tumor or extracapsular extension (ECE), including seminal vesicle invasion. To quantify model accuracy, Receiver Operating Characteristics-derived area under the curve (AUC) was used.  Results:   Of 217 patients fulfilling widest biopsy criteria and 113 fulfilling additional MRI criteria, 64 (29.7%) and 37 (32.7%) remained eligible for FT according to histopathological results. In MVA, fulfillment of MRI criteria reached independent predictor status for prediction of contralateral tumor but not for ECE. Addition of MRI resulted in AUC gain (57.5-64.6%). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for MRI to predict contralateral tumor were: 41.8, 71.6, 70.9 and 42.6%, respectively. Virtually the same results were recorded for Gleason 3 + 3 and/or PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL.  Conclusions:   Patient eligibility criteria for FT using biopsy criteria remained insufficient with respect to contralateral tumor disease. Although, MRI improves accuracy, it cannot safely exclude or minimize chance of significant cancer on contralateral prostate side.

However the homeostatic regulation of Zn2+ and their role in prostate cancer (PC) progression is poorly understood. Therefore the subcellular distribution and uptake of Zn2+ in PC cells were investigated. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy and fluorescent microscopy with the Zn2+-specific fluorescent probe FluoZin-3 were used to quantify total and free Zn2+, respectively, in the normal prostate epithelial cell line (PNT1A) and three human PC cell lines (PC3, DU145 and LNCaP). The effects of Zn2+ treatment on proliferation and survival were measured in vitro using MTT assays and in vivo using mouse xenografts. The ability of Zn2+ to protect against oxidative stress via a HIF1α-dependent mechanism was investigated using a HIF1α knock-down PC3 model. Our results demonstrate that the total Zn2+ concentration in normal PNT1A and PC cells is similar, but PC3 cells contain significantly higher free Zn2+ than PNT1A cells (p < 0.01). PNT1A cells can survive better in the presence of high concentrations of Zn2+ than PC3 cells. Exposure to 10 µM Zn2+ over 72 hours significantly reduces PC3 cell proliferation in vitro but not in vivo. Zn2+ increases PC3 cell survival up to 2.3-fold under oxidative stress, and this protective effect is not seen in PNT1A cells or in a HIF1α-KD PC3 cell model. A state of Zn2+ dyshomeostasis exists in PC. HIF1α is an integral component of a Zn2+-dependent protective mechanism present in PC3 cells.

This malignant phenotype is characterized by resistance to conventional treatments and predisposes to formation of hypoxic regions containing stem-like cancer cells. Unfortunately, an effective therapy to target prostate cancer stem cells under hypoxia has not yet been established. In this report, we studied whether δ-tocotrienol (T3), a vitamin E family member that has exhibited the most potent anti-cancer activity, could suppress the survival of prostate cancer stem-like cells.  Materials and methods:   PC3 stem-like cells were isolated from PC3 parental cells using a three-dimensional culture system. The stemness of the isolated PC3 stem-like cells was confirmed by evaluation of resistance to an anticancer agent (docetaxel) and tumor formation capacity in a xenograft model. The effects of δ-T3 on PC3 stem-like cells under a hypoxia condition were examined by WST-8 (cell viability), real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting.  Results:   δ-T3 demonstrated a cytotoxic effect on prostate cancer stem-like cells in a dose dependent manner and a reduction in the protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α. Additionally, a specific inhibitor toward HIF-1α induced cytotoxicity on PC3 cells, but selective inhibition of HIF-2α had no effect.

Does the standard clinical target volume (CTV) cover the majority of 68Ga-PSMA-PET detected lymph nodes (LNs) in a primary setting?  Methods:   25 out of 159 patients with primary PC who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-PET-imaging were analyzed in the process of this study. These 25 high-risk patients had a total of 126 LNs with positive 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake. A standard CTV according to the 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group' consensus was delineated and LNs were judged whether they were in- or outside of this target volume. With a Pearson correlation we additionally evaluated whether the Gleason score, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value or the risk according to the Roach formula correlate with a higher chance of LNs being outside of the CTV in uncommon LN locations.  Results:   81 (64.3%) of 126 LNs were covered by the CTV with a complete coverage of all positive LNs inside the respective radiation volume in 11 of 25 patients (44%). LNs that were not covered by the CTV included (para-aortic,) common-iliac, pre-sacral, obturatoric, para-rectal, para-vesical and pre-acetabular locations. In a statistical analysis neither the Gleason score, nor the PSA value, nor the calculated risk with the Roach formula correlated with LNs being inside or outside of the CTV in this patient group.  Conclusion: 68Ga-PSMA-PET-imaging proves to be a valuable asset for patients and physicians for primary diagnosis and treatment planning.

Several BET inhibitors (BETi) that displace BRD4 from chromatin are being evaluated in clinical trials for CRPC. Here, we describe mechanisms of acquired resistance to BETi that are amenable to targeted therapies in CRPC. BETi-resistant CRPC cells displayed cross-resistance to a variety of BETi in the absence of gatekeeper mutations, exhibited reduced chromatin-bound BRD4, and were less sensitive to BRD4 degraders/knockdown, suggesting a BRD4-independent transcription program. Transcriptomic analysis revealed reactivation of AR signaling due to CDK9-mediated phosphorylation of AR, resulting in sensitivity to CDK9 inhibitors and enzalutamide. Additionally, increased DNA damage associated with PRC2-mediated transcriptional silencing of DDR genes was observed, leading to PARP inhibitor sensitivity. Collectively, our results identify the therapeutic limitation of BETi as a monotherapy; however, our BETi resistance data suggest unique opportunities for combination therapies in treating CRPC.""","""['Aishwarya Pawar', 'Paradesi Naidu Gollavilli', 'Shaomeng Wang', 'Irfan A Asangani']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Rep""","""['Resistance to BET Inhibitor Leads to Alternative Therapeutic Vulnerabilities in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) Family Proteins in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).', 'Exploitation of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Transcription Factor Dependencies by the Novel BET Inhibitor ABBV-075.', 'Selective targeting of PARP-2 inhibits androgen receptor signaling and prostate cancer growth through disruption of FOXA1 function.', 'Role of BET proteins in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BET bromodomain inhibitors--a novel epigenetic approach in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploring anti-androgen therapies in hormone dependent prostate cancer and new therapeutic routes for castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the Heterogeneous Genomic Landscape in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer through Inhibitors of the Transcriptional Machinery.', 'Epigenetics in prostate cancer treatment.', 'BET Proteins as Attractive Targets for Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Dynamic Interactions of Transcription Factors and Enhancer Reprogramming in Cancer Progression.']"""

Background:   - Prostate cancer is common and a frequent cause of cancer death. Both the frequency of prostate cancer in men and its propensity for causing premature mortality require insurance company medical directors and underwriters to have a good understanding of prostate cancer-related mortality trends, patterns, and outcomes in the insured population.  Methodology:   - Life insurance applicants with reported prostate cancer were extracted from data covering United States residents between November 2007 and November 2014. Information about these applicants was matched to the Social Security Death Master (SSDMF) file for deaths occurring from 2007 to 2011 and to another commercially available death source file (Other Death Source, ODS) for deaths occurring from 2007 to 2014 to determine vital status. Actual to Expected (A/E) mortality ratios were calculated using the Society of Actuaries 2015 Valuation Basic Table (2015VBT), select and ultimate table (age last birthday) and the 2013 US population as expected mortality ratios. All expected bases were not smoker distinct.  Results:   - The study covered applicants between the ages of 45 and 75 and had approximately 405,000 person-years of exposure. Older aged applicants had a lower mortality ratio than those who were younger. Applicants 45 to 54 had the highest mortality ratios in the first year after diagnosis which steadily decreased in years 6 to 10 with an increase in the mortality ratio for those over 10 years from diagnosis. Relative mortality rate was close to unity for those with localized cancer across all age groups. The mortality ratio was 2 to 4 times greater for those with cancer in 1 positive node, and much greater with 3 positive nodes. For each time-from-diagnosis category, the relative mortality ratios compared to age were highest in the 45-54 age group. The A/E mortality ratios based on the 2015VBT were consistently 3 to 4 times that of the mortality ratios based on the 2013 US population.  Conclusion:   - The mortality patterns of insurance applicants with prostate cancer were similar to that observed in individuals with prostate cancer in the general population. Applicant age, time to diagnosis and cancer severity were the most significant variables to predict mortality.""","""['Stephen A Freitas', 'Ross MacKenzie', 'David N Wylde', 'Bradley T Roudebush', 'Richard L Bergstrom', 'J Carl Holowaty', 'Margaret Beckman', 'Steven J Rigatti', 'Stacy Gill']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Insur Med""","""['All-Cause Mortality for Life Insurance Applicants with a History of Breast Cancer.', 'All-Cause Mortality for Life Insurance Applicants with a Family History of Coronary Artery Disease Before 60.', 'All-Cause Mortality for Life Insurance Applicants with the Presence of Bundle Branch Block.', 'Long-term morbidity and mortality risk in Japanese insurance applicants with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.', 'Sutureless Aortic Valve Replacement for Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Single Technology Assessment of Perceval Sutureless Aortic Valve Internet.']"""

Comparative studies have been limited by their ability to match patients on the basis of pretreatment prognostic variables and to adjust for the cancer-related, medical, and socioeconomic differences between patients who choose radiotherapeutic or surgical approaches. Methods We analyzed the outcome of all patients in the National Cancer Database with high-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer with complete prognostic data who were treated with either radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) combined with androgen deprivation (AD), or EBRT plus brachytherapy with or without AD. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for covariable imbalance among treatment groups. The weighted time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model was then used to estimate the effects of treatment groups on survival, accounting for differential treatment initiation times. A predictive model of pathologic nodal (pLN) status was built using prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, and clinical T stage; predicted pLN status was used to repeat the inverse probability of treatment weighting and time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model. Results A total of 42,765 patients were analyzed. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between RP and EBRT plus brachytherapy with or without AD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.55). However, EBRT plus AD was associated with higher mortality than RP (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.92). Adjustment for predicted pLN status did not yield statistically different results. A sensitivity analysis showed that EBRT plus AD ≥ 7920 cGy narrowed the difference, but a significantly higher mortality remained (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.68). Conclusion After comprehensively adjusting for imbalances in prostate cancer prognostic factors, other medical conditions, and socioeconomic factors, this analysis showed no statistical difference in survival between patients treated with RP versus EBRT plus brachytherapy with or without AD.

Subjects and methods:   A cross-sectional postal survey of 10 000 men aged ≥40 years in NI was conducted and age-matched to the distribution of men living with prostate cancer. The EuroQoL five Dimensions five Levels (EQ-5D-5L) and 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Composite (EPIC-26) instruments were used to enable comparisons with prostate cancer outcome studies. Whilst representative of the prostate cancer survivor population, the age-distribution of the sample differs from the general population, thus data were generalised to the NI population by excluding those aged 40-59 years and applying survey weights. Results are presented as proportions reporting problems along with mean composite scores, with differences by respondent characteristics assessed using chi-squared tests, analysis of variance, and multivariable log-linear regression.  Results:   Amongst men aged ≥60 years, 32.8% reported sexual dysfunction, 9.3% urinary dysfunction, and 6.5% bowel dysfunction. In all, 38.1% reported at least one problem and 2.1% all three. Worse outcome was associated with increasing number of long-term conditions, low physical activity, and higher body mass index (BMI). Urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction, and sexual dysfunction increased with age; whilst urinary incontinence, bowel, and sexual dysfunction were more common among the unemployed.  Conclusion:   These data provide an insight into sensitive issues seldom reported by elderly men, which result in poor general health, but could be addressed given adequate service provision. The relationship between these problems, raised BMI and low physical activity offers the prospect of additional health gain by addressing public health issues such as obesity. The results provide essential contemporary population data against which outcomes for those living with prostate cancer can be compared.

Accordingly, understanding the mechanism of resistance to ADT and finding new approach to enhance the efficacy of ADT may provide a major benefit to PCa patients. In our study, we found upregulated expression of Notch receptors is positive associated with ADT-resistance progression. Using fluorescent Notch signaling reporter system, we observed that endogenous Notch signaling could be activated after treatment of androgen deprivation in LNCaP cells via activation of Notch3. In addition, exogenous activation of the Notch signaling though Dox-induced overexpression of any Notch intracellular domains (NICD1-4) could enhance the resistance of PCa cells to ADT under ex vivo 3D culture conditions and upregulate expression of ADT resistance-associated phospho-p38 and Bcl-2 in LNCaP cells. As a result, pharmacological inhibition of the Notch pathway using γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI), DAPT, downregulated both phospho-p38 and Bcl-2 expression and significantly enhanced the efficacy of ADT in androgen sensitive PCa cells with impaired proliferation and 3D colony formation, increased apoptosis and remarkable inhibition of tumor growth in murine subcutaneous xenograft model.

However, it has not been shown that there is a clear correlation between time to metastasis and overall survival. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of time to metastasis on OS in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Between 2008 and 2015, 269 patients with mPCa were included in this retrospective study with a median follow-up of 7.1 years. Patients were divided into three groups: (1) Presentation with metastasis within three months of initial diagnosis (de-novo-M); (2) patients free of metastasis initially but developed metastasis more than 6 months prior to castration resistance (CSPC-M); (3) patients who developed metastasis within 6 months of becoming castration resistant or after (CRPC-M).  Results:   There was a significant decrease in OS when metastases were present at diagnosis (median 6.39 years) compared to CRPC-M (19.07) and CSPC-M (18.19 years). De-novo-M and CSPC-M showed a longer OS from occurrence of metastasis to death when compared to CRPC-M, although reaching CRPC earlier. There was no difference in OS between the groups once castration resistance was reached. Time from initial diagnosis to metastasis and to CRPC was correlated with OS and remained important prognosticators in multivariate Cox-regression (p < 0.01 for both).  Conclusions:   Time from diagnosis to CRPC (all patients) and time to metastasis (for CRPC-M and CSPC-M patients) are significant prognosticators of overall survival and are therefore valid surrogates in a study setting. Therefore, time to CRPC should be prolonged as long as possible.""","""['Sebastian Frees', 'Shusuke Akamatsu', 'Samir Bidnur', 'Daniel Khalaf', 'Claudia Chavez-Munoz', 'Werner Struss', 'Bernhard J Eigl', 'Martin Gleave', 'Kim N Chi', 'Alan So']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Clinical Characterization of Low Prostate-specific Antigen on Prognosis in Patients With Metastatic Castration-naive Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic Impacts of Metastatic Site and Pain on Progression to Castrate Resistance and Mortality in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'In Men with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, Visceral Metastases Predict Shorter Overall Survival: What Predicts Visceral Metastases?

Receiver operating characteristics-derived area under the curve (AUC), Heagerty's C-index, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to quantify model accuracy and to compare the current tool with the Walz nomogram, the online Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram and the post-surgical Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assesment (CAPRA-S).  Results:   The eBCR nomogram relies on independent BCR predictors at 12 and 24 months after RP: preoperative PSA, pathological Gleason Score, tumor stage, lymph node, and surgical margin status. It achieved 81% accuracy at both time points in external validation. Additionally, the current nomogram yielded best calibration, optimal DCA results, and highest rates of avoided aRT in cutoff analyses, compared to the Walz nomogram, the MSKCC nomogram, and the CAPRA-S score.  Conclusions:   The updated eBCR nomogram is easily applicable, highly accurate, and may allow avoiding immediate aRT in a large proportion of patients with few concomitant missed eBCR instances.

Background:   Selinexor is a first-in-class selective inhibitor of nuclear export compound that specifically inhibits the nuclear export protein Exportin-1 (XPO-1), leading to nuclear accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins.  Methods:   This phase II study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of selinexor in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) refractory to abiraterone and/or enzalutamide.  Results:   Fourteen patients were enrolled. Selinexor was initially administered at 65 mg/m2 twice a week (days 1 and 3) and was subsequently reduced to 60 mg flat dose twice a week (days 1 and 3), 3 weeks on, 1 week off, to improve tolerability. The median treatment duration was 13 weeks. At a median follow-up of 4 months, two patients (14%) had ≥50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline, and seven patients (50%) had any PSA decline. Of eight patients with measurable disease at baseline, two (25%) had a partial response and four (50%) had stable disease as their best radiographic response. Five patients (36%) experienced serious adverse events (SAEs; all unrelated to selinexor), and five patients (36%) experienced treatment-related grade 3-4 AEs. The most common drug-related adverse events (AEs) of any severity were anorexia, nausea, weight loss, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia.

Mechanisms contributing to both NEPC development and its aggressiveness remain elusive. In light of the fact that hyperchromatic nuclei are a distinguishing histopathologic feature of NEPC, we utilized transcriptomic analyses of our patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, multiple clinical cohorts, and genetically engineered mouse models to identify 36 heterochromatin-related genes that are significantly enriched in NEPC. Longitudinal analysis using our unique, first-in-field PDX model of adenocarcinoma-to-NEPC transdifferentiation revealed that, among those 36 heterochromatin-related genes, heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α) expression increased early and steadily during NEPC development and remained elevated in the developed NEPC tumor. Its elevated expression was further confirmed in multiple PDX and clinical NEPC samples. HP1α knockdown in the NCI-H660 NEPC cell line inhibited proliferation, ablated colony formation, and induced apoptotic cell death, ultimately leading to tumor growth arrest. Its ectopic expression significantly promoted NE transdifferentiation in adenocarcinoma cells subjected to androgen deprivation treatment. Mechanistically, HP1α reduced expression of androgen receptor and RE1 silencing transcription factor and enriched the repressive trimethylated histone H3 at Lys9 mark on their respective gene promoters. These observations indicate a novel mechanism underlying NEPC development mediated by abnormally expressed heterochromatin genes, with HP1α as an early functional mediator and a potential therapeutic target for NEPC prevention and management.Significance: Heterochromatin proteins play a fundamental role in NEPC, illuminating new therapeutic targets for this aggressive disease.

Autocrine and microenvironmental signals dictate PCSLC behavior and patient outcome. In prostate cancer patients, IL30/IL27p28 has been linked with tumor progression, but the mechanisms underlying this link remain mostly elusive. Here, we asked whether IL30 may favor prostate cancer progression by conditioning PCSLCs and assessed the value of blocking IL30 to suppress tumor growth. IL30 was produced by PCSLCs in human and murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and displayed significant autocrine and paracrine effects. PCSLC-derived IL30 supported PCSLC viability, self-renewal and tumorigenicity, expression of inflammatory mediators and growth factors, tumor immune evasion, and regulated chemokine and chemokine receptor genes, primarily via STAT1/STAT3 signaling. IL30 overproduction by PCSLCs promoted tumor onset and development associated with increased proliferation, vascularization, and myeloid cell recruitment. Furthermore, it promoted PCSLC dissemination to lymph nodes and bone marrow by upregulating the CXCR5/CXCL13 axis, and drove metastasis to lungs through the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. These mechanisms were drastically hindered by IL30 knockdown or knockout in PCSLCs. Collectively, these results mark IL30 as a key driver of PCSLC behavior. Targeting IL30 signaling may be a potential therapeutic strategy against prostate cancer progression and recurrence.Significance: IL30 plays an important role in regulating prostate cancer stem-like cell behavior and metastatic potential, therefore targeting this cytokine could hamper prostate cancer progression or recurrence.

Patients and methods:   Between 2008 and 2013, 471 consecutive men with localized prostate cancer were treated on 2 institutional protocols (NCT01766492, NCT01618851) or on a prospective institutional registry with patient-reported health-related quality of life. All patients were treated with ultra-hypofractionated radiation therapy. Erectile function (EF) was defined as ""firm enough for intercourse"" with or without aids per Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 (n = 222 at baseline); results apply to this cohort unless specifically noted. Sexual aid utilization and efficacy were patient reported. Multivariable analysis of EF was performed.  Results:   Median follow-up was 60 months, median age was 67 years, and 70% had intermediate- or high-risk disease per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. At 24 and 60 months, questionnaire response rates were 86% and 67%, and EF was retained in 53% and 41%, respectively. Baseline sexual aid utilization was 37% (n = 82) and was associated with lower 24-month EF preservation on multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio 0.49, 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.92). By 60 months, 70% of men had tried aids. Of those who found aids helpful at baseline, 84% to 89% reported continued benefit at 24 to 60 months.

Purpose To compare the utility of various metrics derived from monoexponential model (MEM), biexponential model (BEM), stretched-exponential model (SEM) based diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in the differential diagnosis of prostate cancer. Material and Methods Thirty-three patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Multi-b value and multi-direction DWIs were performed. In-bore MR-guided biopsy was performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), pure molecular diffusion (ADCslow), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (ADCfast), perfusion fraction (f), water molecular diffusion heterogeneity index (α), distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC), non-Gaussian diffusion coefficient (MD), and mean kurtosis (MK) values were calculated and compared between cancerous and non-cancerous groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for all parameters and models. Results ADC, ADCslow, DDC, and MD values were significantly lower while MK value was significantly higher in prostate cancer than those of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia. ADC, ADCslow, DDC, MD, and MK could discriminate between tumor and non-tumorous lesions (area under the curve, 0.856, 0.835, 0.866, 0.918, and 0.937, respectively).

Objective:   To evaluate the effect of a single prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening intervention and standardized diagnostic pathway on prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP) included 419 582 men aged 50 to 69 years and was conducted at 573 primary care practices across the United Kingdom. Randomization and recruitment of the practices occurred between 2001 and 2009; patient follow-up ended on March 31, 2016.  Intervention:   An invitation to attend a PSA testing clinic and receive a single PSA test vs standard (unscreened) practice.  Main outcomes and measures:   Primary outcome: prostate cancer-specific mortality at a median follow-up of 10 years. Prespecified secondary outcomes: diagnostic cancer stage and Gleason grade (range, 2-10; higher scores indicate a poorer prognosis) of prostate cancers identified, all-cause mortality, and an instrumental variable analysis estimating the causal effect of attending the PSA screening clinic.  Results:   Among 415 357 randomized men (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [5.6] years), 189 386 in the intervention group and 219 439 in the control group were included in the analysis (n = 408 825; 98%). In the intervention group, 75 707 (40%) attended the PSA testing clinic and 67 313 (36%) underwent PSA testing. Of 64 436 with a valid PSA test result, 6857 (11%) had a PSA level between 3 ng/mL and 19.9 ng/mL, of whom 5850 (85%) had a prostate biopsy. After a median follow-up of 10 years, 549 (0.30 per 1000 person-years) died of prostate cancer in the intervention group vs 647 (0.31 per 1000 person-years) in the control group (rate difference, -0.013 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, -0.047 to 0.022]; rate ratio [RR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.08]; P = .50). The number diagnosed with prostate cancer was higher in the intervention group (n = 8054; 4.3%) than in the control group (n = 7853; 3.6%) (RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14 to 1.25]; P < .001). More prostate cancer tumors with a Gleason grade of 6 or lower were identified in the intervention group (n = 3263/189 386 [1.7%]) than in the control group (n = 2440/219 439 [1.1%]) (difference per 1000 men, 6.11 [95% CI, 5.38 to 6.84]; P < .001). In the analysis of all-cause mortality, there were 25 459 deaths in the intervention group vs 28 306 deaths in the control group (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.03]; P = .49). In the instrumental variable analysis for prostate cancer mortality, the adherence-adjusted causal RR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.29; P = .66).  Conclusions and relevance:   Among practices randomized to a single PSA screening intervention vs standard practice without screening, there was no significant difference in prostate cancer mortality after a median follow-up of 10 years but the detection of low-risk prostate cancer cases increased. Although longer-term follow-up is under way, the findings do not support single PSA testing for population-based screening.

Patients and methods:   Bioinformatic and experimental methods were used to assess the distribution of MSR1 across the genome, evaluate the regulatory potential of such elements and explore the role of MSR1 elements in cancer, particularly non-familial breast cancer and prostate cancer.  Results:   MSR1s are predominately located at chromosome 19 and are functionally enriched in regulatory regions of the genome, particularly regions implicated in short-range regulatory activities (H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3). MSR1-regulated genes were found to have specific molecular roles, such as serine-protease activity (P = 4.80 × 10-7) and ion channel activity (P = 2.7 × 10-4). The kallikrein locus was found to contain a large number of MSR1 clusters, and at least six of these showed CNV. An MSR1 cluster was identified within KLK14, with 9 and 11 copies being normal variants. A significant association with the 9-copy allele and non-familial breast cancer was found in two independent populations (P = 0.004; P = 0.03). In the white British population, the minor allele conferred an increased risk of 1.21-3.51 times for all non-familial disease, or 1.7-5.3 times in early-onset disease. The 9-copy allele was also found to be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in an independent population (odds ratio = 1.27-1.56; P =0.009).  Conclusions:   MSR1 repeats act as molecular switches that modulate gene expression. It is likely that CNV of MSR1 will affect risk of development of various forms of cancer, including that of breast and prostate. The MSR1 cluster at KLK14 represents the strongest risk factor identified to date in non-familial breast cancer and a significant risk factor for prostate cancer. Analysis of MSR1 genotype will allow development of precise stratification of disease risk and provide a novel target for therapeutic agents.""","""['A M Rose', 'A Krishan', 'C F Chakarova', 'L Moya', 'S K Chambers', 'M Hollands', 'J C Illingworth', 'S M G Williams', 'H E McCabe', 'A Z Shah', 'C N A Palmer', 'A Chakravarti', 'J N Berg', 'J Batra', 'S S Bhattacharya']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['Sequence analysis of the human kallikrein gene locus identifies a unique polymorphic minisatellite element.', 'Kallikreins are involved in an miRNA network that contributes to prostate cancer progression.', 'MSR1 variants and the risks of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia: a population-based study in China.', 'Hereditary/familial versus sporadic prostate cancer: few indisputable genetic differences and many similar clinicopathological features.', 'Prostate cancer susceptibility genes: lessons learned and challenges posed.', 'Variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) as modifiers of breast cancer risk in carriers of BRCA1 185delAG.', 'The Pharmacological Mechanism of Curcumin against Drug Resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Findings of Network Pharmacology and Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'The promising role of new molecular biomarkers in prostate cancer: from coding and non-coding genes to artificial intelligence approaches.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the prognostic and role in immune cell infiltration of MSR1 expression in lower-grade gliomas.', 'Bioinformatics analysis reveals that ANXA1 and SPINK5 are novel tumor suppressor genes in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Two very different heating techniques are often applied: capacitive and radiative heating. In this paper, numerical simulations are applied to compare the performance of both techniques in heating of deep-seated tumours.  Methods:   Phantom simulations were performed for small (30 × 20 × 50 cm3) and large (45 × 30 × 50 cm3), homogeneous fatless and inhomogeneous fat-muscle, tissue-equivalent phantoms with a central or eccentric target region. Radiative heating was simulated with the 70 MHz AMC-4 system and capacitive heating was simulated at 13.56 MHz. Simulations were performed for small fatless, small (i.e. fat layer typically <2 cm) and large (i.e. fat layer typically >3 cm) patients with cervix, prostate, bladder and rectum cancer. Temperature distributions were simulated using constant hyperthermic-level perfusion values with tissue constraints of 44 °C and compared for both heating techniques.  Results:   For the small homogeneous phantom, similar target heating was predicted with radiative and capacitive heating. For the large homogeneous phantom, most effective target heating was predicted with capacitive heating. For inhomogeneous phantoms, hot spots in the fat layer limit adequate capacitive heating, and simulated target temperatures with radiative heating were 2-4 °C higher. Patient simulations predicted therapeutic target temperatures with capacitive heating for fatless patients, but radiative heating was more robust for all tumour sites and patient sizes, yielding target temperatures 1-3 °C higher than those predicted for capacitive heating.  Conclusion:   Generally, radiative locoregional heating yields more favourable simulated temperature distributions for deep-seated pelvic tumours, compared with capacitive heating.

We aimed to create a Chinese version of EPIC to further research in the Chinese-speaking population.  Methods:   A prototype was created by forward-backward translations and revisions. During cultural adaptation, 15 participants were interviewed after they had completed the prototype. A few issues highlighted included confusion related to the question format, subject non-familiarity with the Chinese term for ""hot flashes,"" and the use of the Chinese term for ""breast"" as a strictly female body part. A pilot version was created based on the cultural adaptation findings. Validation of the pilot version was performed by having 50 participants complete the Chinese EPIC and EORTC QLQ-c30 twice within a 4-week period. Test-retest reliability (Pearson's correlations and difference distribution) and internal consistency (Cronbach's α) were measured using SAS version 9.4.  Results:   Test-retest reliability values for the urinary, bowel, sexual and hormone domains were 0.71, 0.51, 0.51 and 0.66, respectively; subscale test-retest reliability ranged between 0.29 and 0.82. Internal consistency for domains was good with Cronbach's α ranging from 0.76 to 0.78 for the initial test and 0.67 to 0.85 for the retest. The performance of this version of EPIC was comparable to the validated EORTC QLQ-C30.  Conclusion:   The EPIC questionnaire was successfully translated into Chinese and was culturally adapted.

Methods:   We retrospectively enrolled 98 patients with CRPC on abiraterone or enzalutamide, and investigated the prognostic value of CTC cluster detection (+ v -) and AR-V7 detection (+ v -) using a CTC cluster detection - based AR-V7 mRNA assay. We examined ≤50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), clinical and radiological progression-free survival (radiologic PSF), and overall survival (OS). We then assessed whether AR-V7 expression in CTC clusters identified after On-chip multi-imaging flow cytometry was related to disease progression and survival after first-line systemic therapy.  Results:   All abiraterone-treated or enzalutamide-treated patients received prior docetaxel. The median follow-up was 20.7 (range: 3.0-37.0) months in the abiraterone and enzalutamide cohorts, respectively. Forty-nine of the 98 men (50.0%) were CTC cluster (-), 23 of the 98 men (23.5%) were CTC cluster(+)/AR-V7(-), and 26 of the 98 men (26.5%) were CTC cluster(+)/AR-V7(+). CTC cluster(+)/AR-V7(+) patients were more likely to have EOD ≥3 at diagnosis (P = 0.003), pain (P = 0.023), higher alkaline phosphatase levels (P < 0.001), and visceral metastases (P < 0.001).

This phase II study was designed to assess antitumor activity of MLN0128 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods Eligible patients had mCRPC previously treated with abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide. Five patients started MLN0128 at 5 mg once daily, subsequently dose reduced to 4 mg because of toxicity. Four subsequent patients started MLN0128 at 4 mg daily. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months. Results Nine patients were enrolled and median time on treatment was 11 weeks (range: 3-30). Best response was stable disease. All patients had a rise in PSA on treatment, with a median 159% increase from baseline (range: 12-620%). Median baseline circulating tumor cell count was 1 cell/mL (range: 0-40); none had a decrease in cell count posttreatment. Grade ≤ 2 adverse events included fatigue, anorexia, and rash. The most common serious adverse events were grade 3 dyspnea and maculopapular rash. Eight patients discontinued treatment early because of radiographic progression (n = 1), grade 3 toxicity (n = 5), or investigator discretion (n = 2). Four patients had immediate PSA decline following drug discontinuation, suggesting MLN0128 could cause compensatory increase of androgen receptor (AR) activity. Correlative studies of pretreatment and posttreatment biopsy specimens revealed limited inhibition of AKT phosphorylation, 4EBP1 phosphorylation, and eIF4E activity.

Results of the EDIFICE Surveys""","""Background:   We studied cancer screening over time and social vulnerability via surveys of representative populations.  Methods:   Individuals aged 50-75 years with no personal history of cancer were questioned about lifetime participation in screening tests, compliance (adherence to recommended intervals [colorectal, breast and cervical cancer]) and opportunistic screening (prostate and lung cancer).  Results:   The proportion of vulnerable/non-vulnerable individuals remained stable between 2011 and 2016. In 2011, social vulnerability had no impact on screening participation, nor on compliance. In 2014, however, vulnerability was correlated with less frequent uptake of colorectal screening (despite an organised programme) and prostate cancer screening (opportunistic), and also with reduced compliance with recommended intervals (breast and cervical cancer screening). In 2016, the trends observed in 2014 were substantiated and even extended to breast, colorectal and cervical cancer screening uptakes. Social vulnerability has an increasingly negative impact on cancer screening attendance. The phenomenon was identified in 2014 and had expanded by 2016.  Conclusion:   Although organised programmes have been shown to ensure equitable access to cancer screening, this remains a precarious achievement requiring regular monitoring. Further studies should focus on attitudes of vulnerable populations and on ways to improve cancer awareness campaigns.""","""['Jean-François Morère', 'François Eisinger', 'Chantal Touboul', 'Christine Lhomel', 'Sébastien Couraud', 'Jérôme Viguier']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Curr Oncol Rep""","""['Fluctuating Behavior of the French Population in Cancer Screening: 5th Edition of the EDIFICE Survey.', 'Cancer screening in France: third edition of the EDIFICE survey.', 'Colon Cancer Screening Programs: Impact of an Organized Screening Strategy Assessed by the EDIFICE Surveys.', 'Cancer screening in France: 10\xa0years of analysis of behaviours by the EDIFICE surveys.', ""Participants, Physicians or Programmes: Participants' educational level and initiative in cancer screening."", 'mHealth Interventions to Improve Cancer Screening and Early Detection: Scoping Review of Reviews.', 'Brief Hospital Supervision of Exercise and Diet During Adjuvant Breast Cancer Therapy Is Not Enough to Relieve Fatigue: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.']"""

To discriminate the features of hypoechoic lesions, we investigated the ultrasonographic characteristics of hypoechoic lesions using numerical analysis in image. In addition, we evaluated previously suggested subjective parameters on hypoechoic lesion.  Methods:   We performed one-core targeted biopsy (TBx) for each hypoechoic lesion in up to two lesions in each patient before the 12-core systemic biopsy was obtained between July 2015 and May 2016. Image analysis data were analyzed using grayscale values and Hounsfield units (HU) to measure heterogeneity. Subjective evaluation of hypoechoic lesions including hypoechoicity, irregularity, vascularity, and microcalcification was also validated.  Results:   Of 157 patients (median age = 67.1 years, median prostate-specific antigen = 6.21 ng/mL) included in the study, 77 (49.0%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa), and 39 (17.0%) diagnoses were confirmed by the results of targeted cores. The existence of hypoechoic lesions was not a final predictor for PCa detection. In multivariate analysis using a combination of clinical and quantitative image analyses, the grayscale value was identified as a significant predictive factor for the presence of PCa and high-grade disease (Gleason score ≥ 7) on target lesions. The combination of clinical and image variables had the highest area under the curve (0.890) for detecting PCa in TBx.  Conclusions:   The proposed method for the quantitation of hypoechoic lesions using grayscale images and HU is simple. Combined with the current clinical approaches, quantitative scoring of lesions can be useful for detecting PCa and making more precise diagnoses.""","""['Kwang Suk Lee', 'Kyo Chul Koo', 'Byung Ha Chung']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Re: Quantitation of hypoechoic lesions for the prediction and Gleason grading of prostate cancer: a prospective study.', 'Usefulness of grayscale values of hypoechoic lesions matched with target lesions observed on magnetic resonance imaging for the prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Usefulness of grayscale values measuring hypoechoic lesions for predicting prostate cancer: An experimental pilot study.', 'Comparison of prostate cancer detection rates of various prostate biopsy methods for patients with prostate-specific antigen levels of <10.0 ng/mL in real-world practice.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'A scoring diagnostic system based on biparametric ultrasound features for prostate cancer risk assessment.', 'Role of the elastography strain ratio using transrectal ultrasonography in the diagnosis of prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Usefulness of grayscale values of hypoechoic lesions matched with target lesions observed on magnetic resonance imaging for the prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Usefulness of grayscale values measuring hypoechoic lesions for predicting prostate cancer: An experimental pilot study.', ""Effect of training and individual operator's expertise on prostate cancer detection through prostate biopsy: Implications for the current quantitative training evaluation system.""]"""

Methods:   An imaging database was searched for consecutive patients who underwent prostate MRI followed by MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy from October 2015 through October 2017. The initial MRI reporting template used included only subheadings. In July 2016, the template was changed to a standardized PI-RADS-compliant structured template incorporating dropdown menus. Lesion, patient characteristics, pathology, and adherence to the PI-RADS lexicon were extracted from MRI reports and patient charts. Diagnostic performance of prostate MRI to detect CS-PCa using combined ultrasound-MRI fusion and systematic biopsy as a reference standard was assessed.  Results:   Three hundred twenty-four lesions in 202 patients (average age, 67 years; average prostate-specific antigen level, 5.9 ng/mL) were analyzed, including 217 MRI peripheral zone (PZ) lesions, 84 MRI non-PZ lesions, and 23 additional PZ lesions found on systematic biopsy but missed on MRI. Thirty-three percent (106 of 324) were CS-PCa. Adherence to the PI-RADS lexicon improved from 32.9% (50 of 152) to 88.4% (152 of 172) (P < .0001) after introduction of the structured template. The sensitivity of prostate MRI for CS-PCa in the PZ increased from 53% to 70% (P = .011). There was no significant change in specificity (60% versus 55%, P = .458).

These effects concern prevention, mortality and progress of cancer. Furthermore they show a reduction of disease- and treatment-specific side effects, which implies a better patients' quality of life. Evidence shows a decreased mortality risk in patients with physically active cancer of colon, breast, ovaries and prostate. Activity recommendations for patients with cancer do not differ from those for healthy persons. However, a decrease in physical activity can be observed in many cancer patients after diagnosis, and this fact concludes to a reduced physical capacity - although just physical capacity helps to overcome the burden of medical treatment and to recover. In fact, tailored exercise programs can counteract a decrease in physical capacity successfully. Further they reduce side effects such as fatigue, incontinence and lymphedema. Moreover, first studies report a positive influence on: chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathies, cancer-related cognitive impairments, bone health and sleep. Finally, an enormous number of investigations showed that exercise interventions can improve psychosocial factors (e. g. mood and self-esteem). Except for very few conditions, such as extremely impaired blood cell counts and days when cardio- or nephrotoxic drugs are given, physical activity should be recommended. Especially during medical treatment, physicians and therapists are prompted to interact closely in order to prevent general activity prohibitions.

Anoikis is a programmed cell death that is induced upon cell detachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM), which behaves as a critical protective mechanism for anchorage-independent cell growth and metastasis formation. However, in the absence of ECM attachment, shift of metabolic pattern and tolerance to anoikis facilitate the survival of aggressive cancer cells in the circulatory system as well as their metastasis to distant sites. Few molecular targets in PCa have thus far been reported to prevent anoikis resistance, metabolic reprogramming, and metastasis simultaneously. In the present study, elevated migration, invasion, pyruvate production, lactate generation, ATP level, and impaired detachment-induced apoptosis were found in anoikis-resistant PCa cells, and genome microarray analysis demonstrated that the cell migration-inducing protein (CEMIP) was a potential molecular target for the regulation of the aforementioned malignant behaviors. Additional investigation revealed that the AMPK/glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)/β-catenin cascade-triggered CEMIP overexpression in anoikis-resistant PCa cells might be implicated in local progression, metabolic shift, and cellular migration and invasion, whereas knockout of CEMIP by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 in anoikis-resistant PCa cells reversed the described bioeffects by reducing expressions of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), VEGF, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4), and lactate dehydrogenase A. In addition, inhibition of glycolysis by CEMIP-mediated PDK4 down-regulation impaired the migration and invasion of anoikis-resistant PCa cells by attenuating MMP2 and VEGF expressions. Our findings establish that AMPK/GSK3β/β-catenin cascade-triggered CEMIP overexpression might promote migration and invasion in anoikis-resistant PCa cells by enhancing PDK4-associated metabolic reprogramming, which may provide a novel, promising therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced PCa.-Zhang, P., Song, Y., Sun, Y., Li, X., Chen, L., Yang, L., Xing, Y.

Hydroimidazolone (MG-H1) and argpyrimidine (AP) are AGEs originating from MG-mediated post-translational modification of proteins at arginine residues. AP is involved in the control of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a crucial determinant of cancer metastasis and invasion, whose regulation mechanisms in malignant cells are still emerging. Here, we uncover a novel mechanism linking Glo1 to the maintenance of the metastatic phenotype of PCa cells by controlling EMT by engaging the tumour suppressor miR-101, MG-H1-AP and TGF-β1/Smad signalling. Moreover, circulating levels of Glo1, miR-101, MG-H1-AP and TGF-β1 in patients with metastatic compared with non-metastatic PCa support our in vitro results, demonstrating their clinical relevance. We suggest that Glo1, together with miR-101, might be potential therapeutic targets for metastatic PCa, possibly by metformin administration.""","""['Cinzia Antognelli', 'Rodolfo Cecchetti', 'Francesca Riuzzi', 'Matthew J Peirce', 'Vincenzo N Talesa']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Glyoxalase I drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via argpyrimidine-modified Hsp70, miR-21 and SMAD signalling in human bronchial cells BEAS-2B chronically exposed to crystalline silica Min-U-Sil 5: Transformation into a neoplastic-like phenotype.', 'Methylglyoxal Acts as a Tumor-Promoting Factor in Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer.', 'Testosterone and Follicle Stimulating Hormone-Dependent Glyoxalase 1 Up-Regulation Sustains the Viability of Porcine Sertoli Cells through the Control of Hydroimidazolone- and Argpyrimidine-Mediated NF-κB Pathway.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Glyoxalases in Urological Malignancies.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Differential gene expression and network analysis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Targeting Cancer Metabolism Plasticity with JX06 Nanoparticles via Inhibiting PDK1 Combined with Metformin for Endometrial Cancer Patients with Diabetes.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells Secrete Methylglyoxal-Derived MG-H1 to Reprogram Human Osteoblasts into a Dedifferentiated, Malignant-like Phenotype: A Possible Novel Player in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.']"""

Methods:   In a prospective study between October 2015 and November 2016, 20 patients underwent transperitoneal SLND for nodal recurrence of PCa after RP at our institution. Standardized urodynamics were performed pre- and postoperatively after 6 weeks, 3, and 6 to 12 months. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were used to monitor the oncological outcome. Perioperative outcomes encompassed, among others, type of complications after surgery classified to Clavien-Dindo.  Results:   The proportion of patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction was postoperative at 6 weeks, 3, and 6 to 12 months 78.5%, 70%, and 45.5%, respectively. Compared to preoperative urodynamics, follow-ups revealed a statistical significant cleavage of bladder wall compliance until six to twelve months after SLND (34.5 vs 22 mL/cmH2 O, P = 0.044). Referring to the oncological outcome all patients experienced a PSA progression, 10 patients (50%) within 11 weeks after surgery. Overall, four patients (20%) suffered from a postoperative complication after SLND, which comprises Clavien grade I-IIIa.  Conclusions:   Transperitoneal SLND, as a treatment option for patients with nodal recurrence of PCa after RP reveals additional potential pitfalls than previously reported. Urodynamics reveal a significant impact of SLND on postoperative functional bladder dysfunctions. Therefore, informed consent prior to SLND should include the risk of persistent low compliance bladder.""","""['Julian Hanske', 'Guido Müller', 'Arndt van Ophoven', 'Nicolas von Landenberg', 'Florian Roghmann', 'Rein-Jüri Palisaar', 'Christian von Bodman', 'Joachim Noldus', 'Marko Brock']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Neurourol Urodyn""","""['Robotic salvage lymph node dissection for nodal-only recurrences after radical prostatectomy: Perioperative and early oncological outcomes.', 'Long-term Outcomes of Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Nodal Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: Not as Good as Previously Thought.', 'Identifying the Optimal Candidate for Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Nodal Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Analysis.', 'Contemporary role of salvage lymphadenectomy in patients with recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Salvage lymphadenectomy after primary therapy with curative intent for prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed multi-parameter magnetic resonance images from 528 patients with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/ml who underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies between May 2015 and May 2017. Among them, 137 were diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa), and we further subdivided them according to pathological results into the significant PCa (S-PCa) and insignificant significant PCa (Ins-PCa) groups (121 cases were defined by surgical pathological specimen and 16 by biopsy). Age, PSA, percent free PSA, PSA density (PSAD), prostate volume (PV), and PI-RADS score were collected. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of pathological results. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to analyze the diagnostic value of PI-RADS v2 in PCa.  Results:   Multivariate analysis indicated that age, PV, percent free PSA, and PI-RADS score were independent predictors of biopsy findings, while only PI-RADS score was an independent predictor of S-PCa (P < 0.05). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for diagnosing PCa with respect to age, PV, percent free PSA, and PI-RADS score were 0.570, 0.430, 0.589 and 0.836, respectively. The area under the curve for diagnosing S-PCa with respect to PI-RADS score was 0.732. A PI-RADS score of 3 was the best cutoff for predicting PCa, and 4 was the best cutoff for predicting S-PCa. Thus, 92.8% of patients with PI-RADS scores of 1-2 would have avoided biopsy, but at the cost of missing 2.2% of the potential PCa cases. Similarly, 83.82% of patients with a PI-RADS score ≤ 3 would have avoided biopsy, but at the cost of missing 3.3% of the potential S-PCa cases.

There are numerous studies using this peptide with the 68Ga radionuclide. Previous methods to synthetize 18F-labeled PSMA ligands with complexes [18F]AlF2+ have been achieved. However, these reported syntheses were performed manually, using small volumes. Therefore it is only possible to have the radiopharmaceutical on a small scale, for use in preclinical studies. 18F-labelled tracers allow higher doses increasing the number of examined patients. In addition, late images can be acquired in the case of uptake in lymph nodes, to discard inflammation. It is important to transfer the manual synthesis to an automatic module, producing a batch of the radiopharmaceutical with high activity in a safe and effective way. The aim of this work was to optimize the labeling of [18F]AlF-[GLU-UREA-LYS(AHX)-HBED-CC] in a Tracerlab FXFN® (GE) platform.  Results:   The labeling up to the reactor corroborates the formation of the complex [18F]AlF-PSMA. After purification by HPLC, the radiopharmaceutical was achieved with a radiochemical purity higher than 90%. The quality control of the final product fulfilled all the requirements in agreement with USP, such as radiochemical purity (greater than 90%) and residual solvents. [18F]AlF-PSMA was obtained with a yield of 18 ± 3% (n = 7), not decay corrected (NCD) starting off from 500 to 2000 mCi the 18F and with a radiochemical purity of 95 ± 3% (n = 7). The product verified stability in the final formulation vial during 4 hs and in human plasma up to 1 h.

Initial studies suggested the glycosylation of PSA to be a promising marker for a more specific yet noninvasive PCa diagnosis. Recent studies on the molecular features of PSA glycosylation (such as antenna modification and core fucosylation) were not successful in demonstrating its potential for an improved PCa diagnosis, probably due to the lack of analytical sensitivity and specificity of the applied assays. In this study, we established for the first time a high-performance PSA Glycomics Assay (PGA), allowing differentiation of α2,6- and α2,3-sialylated isomers, the latter one being suggested to be a hallmark of aggressive types of cancer. After affinity purification from urine and tryptic digestion, PSA samples were analyzed by CE-ESI-MS (capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization coupled to mass spectrometry). Based on positive controls, an average interday relative standard deviation of 14% for 41 N-glycopeptides was found. The assay was further verified by analyzing PSA captured from patients' urine samples. A total of 67 N-glycopeptides were identified from the PSA pooled from the patients. In summary, the first PGA successfully established in this study allows an in-depth relative quantitation of PSA glycoforms from urine.

Glands of prostate cancer patients frequently contain multiple zones of disease at various stages of progression. The factors that drive disease progression from an indolent benign stage to aggressive disease are not well-defined. Prostate inflammation and carcinoma are associated with high levels of myeloid cell infiltration; these cells are linked to disease progression in other cancers, but their role in prostate cancer is unclear. To determine whether myeloid cells contribute to prostate cancer progression, the ability of prostate tumor-associated CD11b+ cells (TAMC) to drive prostate epithelial cell tumorigenesis was tested. Co-culture of CD11b+ TAMC with non-tumorigenic genetically primed prostate epithelial cells resulted in stable transformation and induction of tumorigenesis. RNA sequencing identified the IL-1α pathway as a potential molecular mechanism responsible for tumor promotion by TAMC. Inhibition of IL-1α delayed growth of TAMC-induced tumors.

A new strategy for the development of gem-disubstituted substrate-product analogues as inhibitors of racemases and epimerases is elaborated using α-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtMCR) as a model enzyme. MtMCR catalyzes the epimerization at C2 of acyl-CoA substrates, a key step in the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids. Moreover, the human enzyme is a potential target for the development of therapeutic agents directed against prostate cancer. We show that rationally designed, N,N-dialkylcarbamoyl-CoA substrate-product analogues inactivate MtMCR. Binding greatly exceeds that of the substrate, (S)-ibuprofenoyl-CoA, up to ∼250-fold and is proportional to the alkyl chain length (4-12 carbons) with the N,N-didecyl and N,N-didodecyl species having competitive inhibition constants with values of 1.9 ± 0.2 μM and 0.42 ± 0.04 μM, respectively.

Therefore, we estimate the differences in register-based costs of publicly funded healthcare in the two arms of the Finnish Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC) after 20 years.  Methods:   We obtained individual-level register data on prescription medications, as well as inpatient and outpatient care, to estimate healthcare costs for 80,149 men during the first 20 years of the FinRSPC. We compared healthcare costs for the men in each trial arm and performed statistical analysis.  Results:   For all men diagnosed with PCa during the 20-year observation period, mean PCa-related costs appeared to be around 10% lower in the screening arm (SA). Mean all-cause healthcare costs for these men were also lower in the SA, but differences were smaller than for PCa-related costs alone, and no longer statistically significant. For men dying from PCa, although the difference was not statistically significant, mean all-cause healthcare costs were around 10% higher. When analysis included all observations, cumulative costs were slightly higher in the CA; however, after excluding extreme values, cumulative costs were slightly higher in the SA.  Conclusions:   No major cost impacts due to screening were apparent, but the FinRSPC's 20-year follow-up period is too short to provide definitive evidence at this stage. Longer term follow-up will be required to be better informed about the costs of, or savings from, introducing mass PCa screening.""","""['Neill Booth', 'Pekka Rissanen', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Kirsi Talala', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Cost-effectiveness analysis of PSA-based mass screening: Evidence from a randomised controlled trial combined with register data.', 'Histological inflammation and risk of subsequent prostate cancer among men with initially elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Long-term health-related quality of life among men with prostate cancer in the Finnish randomized study of screening for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of PSA-based mass screening: Evidence from a randomised controlled trial combined with register data.']"""

Stapf. and Cymbopogon giganteus Chiov. were studied for their essential oils after various chemical extractions. Antioxidant, potential anti-inflammatory action (inhibition of lipoxygenase) and cytotoxic activities were also tested on various prostate cancer and glioblastoma cell lines. Thirty-three compounds were identified in the essential oil of C. giganteus: Limonene (19.33%), Mentha-1(7),8-dien-2-ol cis (17.34%), Mentha-1(7),8-dien-2-ol trans (13.95%), trans-Mentha-2,8-diene-para-ol 1 (13.91%) and Mentha-2,8-diene-1-ol, cis-para (8.10%) were the most abundant. C. citratus essential oil contained 15 compounds and the major ones were geranial/citral A (48.18%) and neral/citral B (34.37%). Essential oil of C. citratus showed the highest ability to scavenge DPPH+ radicals (approximately 68% at 8 mg/mL) while C. giganteus exhibited the highest capability to reduce ABTS+ (0.59μmolET/g). The essential oil of C. citratus was the most effective on prostate cell lines LNCaP (IC50 = 6.36 μg/ml) and PC-3 (IC50 = 32.1 μg/ml), and on glioblastoma cell lines (SF-767 (IC50 = 45.13 μg/ml) and SF-763 (IC50 = 172.05 μg/ml). Interestingly, the activity of essential oil of C. citratus was statistically equal to that of its major component, citral. Combination of both oils showed antagonist, additive, indifferent and synergistic effects on LNCaP, PC-3, SF-767 and SF-763 cell lines, respectively.

Objective:   The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in predicted function over time between RP and EBRT varied by risk group.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation (CEASAR) study is a prospective, population-based, observational study that enrolled men with localized prostate cancer in 2011-2012. Among 2117 CEASAR participants who underwent RP or EBRT, 817 had low-risk, 902 intermediate-risk, and 398 high-risk disease.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patient-reported, disease-specific function was measured using the 26-item Expanded Prostate Index Composite (at baseline and 6, 12, and 36 mo). Predicted function was estimated using regression models and compared by disease risk.  Results and limitations:   Low-risk EBRT patients reported 3-yr sexual function scores 12 points higher than those of low-risk RP patients (RP, 39 points [95% confidence interval {CI}, 37-42] vs EBRT, 52 points [95% CI, 47-56]; p<0.001). The difference in 3-yr scores for high-risk patients was not clinically significant (RP, 32 points [95% CI, 28-35] vs EBRT, 38 points [95% CI, 33-42]; p=0.03). However, when using a commonly used binary definition of sexual function (erections firm enough for intercourse), no major differences were noted between RP and EBRT at 3 yr across low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease strata. No clinically significant interactive effects between treatment and cancer severity were observed for incontinence, bowel, irritative voiding, and hormone domains. The primary limitation is the lack of firmly established thresholds for clinically significant differences in Expanded Prostate Index Composite domain scores.  Conclusions:   For men with low-risk prostate cancer, EBRT was associated with higher sexual function scores at 3 yr than RP; however, for men with high-risk prostate cancer, no clinically significant difference was noted. Men with high-risk prostate cancer should be counseled that EBRT and RP carry similar sexual function outcomes at 3 yr.  Patient summary:   In this report, we studied the urinary, sexual, bowel, and hormonal functions of patients 3 yr after undergoing prostate cancer surgery or radiation. We found that for patients with high-risk disease, sexual function was similar between surgery and radiation.

Circulating miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Prostate specific antigen levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression levels of serum miR-15a were decreased in PCa patients compared with controls, chronic prostatitis and BPH patients (0.43 ± 0.12, 1.7 ± 0.76, 1.56 ± 0.34 and 1.53 ± 0.65, respectively). The expression levels of serum miR-16-1 were decreased in PCa patients compared with controls, chronic prostatitis and BPH patients (0.55 ± 0.23, 2.15 ± 0.87, 2.08 ± 0.54 and 1.96 ±0.61, respectively). Downregulation of miR-15a and miR-16-1 correlated with higher Gleason score (P = 0.002 and P = 0.006, respectively), higher tumor stage (P = 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively), PCa metastasis (P = 0.002 and P = 0.025, respectively) and lymph node involvement (P = 0.02 and P = 0.007, respectively).

BMI is a modifiable lifestyle factor and may provide a unique opportunity for primary prevention of prostate cancer if a causal association exists. Data from 11 886 men from the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET, 1985-1996 with active follow-up through 2005) comprising current and former heavy smokers were analyzed. CARET was a multicenter randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial testing daily supplementation of 30 mg β-carotene+25 000 IU retinyl palmitate for primary prevention of lung cancer. Prostate cancer was a secondary outcome. Nonaggressive disease was defined as Gleason less than 7 and stage I/II. Aggressive disease was primarily defined as at least Gleason 7 or stage III/IV, and secondarily by excluding Gleason 3+4 from the first definition. BMI was calculated from measured weight and height. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer incidence between BMI categories. During follow-up, 883 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. In the analysis of aggressive disease when Gleason 3+4 was excluded, men with a BMI of at least 35 kg/m had an increased rate of prostate cancer (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.04-3.11, Ptrend=0.04) compared with men with BMI 18-24.9 kg/m. No other differences were seen in risk estimates for overall, nonaggressive or aggressive prostate cancer including all Gleason 7 cases, between BMI categories. Our results show an association between having a BMI of at least 35 kg/m and an increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer (not including Gleason 3+4 tumors), but do not support an association between BMI and risk of overall, aggressive disease including all Gleason 7, or nonaggressive prostate cancer within a population of current and former heavy smokers.""","""['Stephanie E Bonn', 'Matt J Barnett', 'Mark Thornquist', 'Gary Goodman', 'Marian L Neuhouser']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Dietary supplement use and prostate cancer risk in the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial.', 'Risk factors for lung cancer and for intervention effects in CARET, the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial.', 'Supplemental and dietary vitamin E, beta-carotene, and vitamin C intakes and prostate cancer risk.', ""Design of Physicians' Health Study II--a randomized trial of beta-carotene, vitamins E and C, and multivitamins, in prevention of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and eye disease, and review of results of completed trials."", 'Chemoprevention of lung cancers: lessons from CARET, the beta-carotene and retinol efficacy trial, and prospects for the future.', 'Associations Between Vertebral Marrow Proton Density Fat Fraction and Risk of Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, the metabolic stability of RM-133 needs to be improved. After investigation, the replacement of its androstane scaffold by a more stable estrane scaffold led to the development of the mestranol derivative RM-581.  Methods:   Using solid-phase strategy involving five steps, we quickly synthesized a series of RM-581 analogs using the recently-developed diethylsilylacetylenic linker. To establish structure-activity relationships, we then investigated their antiproliferative potency on a panel of cancer cell lines from various cancers (breast, prostate, ovarian and pancreatic).  Results:   Some of the mestranol derivatives have shown in vitro anticancer activities that are close to, or better than, those observed for RM-581. Compound 23, a mestranol derivative having a ((3,5-dimethylbenzoyl)- L-prolyl)piperazine side chain at position C2, was found to be active as an antiproliferative agent (IC50 = 0.38 ± 0.34 to 3.17 ± 0.10 µM) and to be twice as active as RM-581 on LNCaP, PC-3, MCF-7, PANC-1 and OVCAR-3 cancer cells (IC50 = 0.56 ± 0.30, 0.89 ± 0.63, 1.36 ± 0.31, 2.47 ± 0.91 and 3.17 ± 0.10 µM, respectively).

At the population level, obesity is associated with prostate cancer mortality; however, some studies have found that higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with better long-term prostate cancer outcomes amongst men with mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   We identified 1 192 patients with non-mCRPC from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database. BMI was calculated from height and weight abstracted from the medical records at the time closest to but prior to CRPC diagnosis and categorised as underweight (<21 kg/m2 ), normal weight (21-24.9 kg/m2 ), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2 ), and obese (≥30 kg/m2 ). Competing risks regression and Cox models were used to test associations between obesity and progression to metastasis, PCSM, and ACM, accounting for confounders.  Results:   Overall, 51 (4%) men were underweight, 239 (25%) were normal weight, 464 (39%) were overweight, and 438 (37%) were obese. In adjusted analysis, higher BMI was significantly associated with reduced ACM (hazard ratio [HR] 0.98, P = 0.012) but not PCSM (HR 1.00, P = 0.737) or metastases (HR 0.99, P = 0.225). Likewise, when BMI was treated as a categorical variable in adjusted models, obesity was not associated with PCSM (HR 1.11, P = 0.436) or metastases (HR 1.06, P = 0.647), but was associated with decreased ACM (HR 0.79, P = 0.016) compared to normal weight. No data were available on treatments received after CRPC diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Amongst patients with non-mCRPC obesity was associated with better overall survival. Although this result mirrors evidence from men with mCRPC, obesity was not associated with prostate cancer outcomes.

Patients and methods:   Prospective data were collected from 540 men with preoperative IIEF-5 scores of 22-25 who underwent RARP by a single surgeon, and of whom 299 had complete data at all time points up to 2 years. In addition to standard assessment tools (IIEF-5 and erections sufficient for intercourse [ESI]), the men were asked to 'indicate the fullness you are able to achieve in erections compared to before surgery?' (range: 0-100%). The primary outcome was prediction of potency (defined as ESI) at 24 months, based on 90-day %fullness tertile (0-24%, 25-74% and 75-100%).  Results:   A total of 299 men with complete follow-up were included in the study. Significant predictors of 24-month potency included age, body mass index, pathological stage, nerve-sparing status and %fullness tertiles. When the men (preoperative IIEF-5 score 22-25) were assessed at 90 days after RARP, 181/299 (61%) had erections inadequate for intercourse. If IIEF-5 scores of 1-6 were used, 142/181 men (78%) would be targeted for early intervention. By contrast, if 0-24% fullness was used, 88/181 men (49%) would be targeted.

We sought to evaluate the clinical utility of prostate and breast overexpressed 1 (PBOV1) as a potential PCa biomarker.  Methods:   Patient tumor samples were designated by Grade Groups using the 2014 Gleason grading system. Primary radical prostatectomy tumors were obtained from 48 patients and evaluated for PBOV1 levels using Western blot analysis in matched cancer and benign cancer-adjacent regions. Immunohistochemical evaluation of PBOV1 was subsequently performed in 80 cancer and 80 benign cancer-adjacent patient samples across two tissue microarrays (TMAs) to verify protein levels in epithelial tissue and to assess correlation between PBOV1 proteins and nuclear architectural changes in PCa cells. Digital histomorphometric analysis was used to track 22 parameters that characterized nuclear changes in PBOV1-stained cells. Using a training and test set for validation, multivariate logistic regression (MLR) models were used to identify significant nuclear parameters that distinguish Grade Group 3 and above PCa from Grade Group 1 and 2 PCa regions.  Results:   PBOV1 protein levels were increased in tumors from Grade Group 3 and above (GS 4 + 3 and ≥ 8) regions versus Grade Groups 1 and 2 (GS 3 + 3 and 3 + 4) regions (P = 0.005) as assessed by densitometry of immunoblots. Additionally, by immunoblotting, PBOV1 protein levels differed significantly between Grade Group 2 (GS 3 + 4) and Grade Group 3 (GS 4 + 3) PCa samples (P = 0.028). In the immunohistochemical analysis, measures of PBOV1 staining intensity strongly correlated with nuclear alterations in cancer cells. An MLR model retaining eight parameters describing PBOV1 staining intensity and nuclear architecture discriminated Grade Group 3 and above PCa from Grade Group 1 and 2 PCa and benign cancer-adjacent regions with a ROC-AUC of 0.90 and 0.80, respectively, in training and test sets.  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrates that the PBOV1 protein could be used to discriminate Grade Group 3 and above PCa. Additionally, the PBOV1 protein could be involved in modulating changes to the nuclear architecture of PCa cells.

In particular in the prostate, this central role of the ECM is further stressed by the fact that several potential markers of prostate stem cells are matrix receptors.  Methods:   We established 12 fibroblastic cell lines from cancerous and non-cancerous areas of six prostates and allowed the cells to produce ECM under cell culture conditions. We also performed a proteome wide analysis of the ECM components by mass spectrometry. To study the in vitro activation of fibroblastic cells we compared the differences between the ECM produced in cell culture by six non-cancerous-tissue-derived fibroblasts and the in vivo matrisome from the corresponding non-cancerous tissue of prostate.  Results:   Our results suggest that at tissue level the ECM is mainly produced by fibroblastic cells and that it contains standard collagen I fibrils and fibril-associated proteins. Beaded-filament forming collagen VI is also abundant and basement membranes potentially contain five laminin subtypes and collagens XV and XVIII. As the main finding, we also detected differences when in vivo and in vitro matrisomes were compared. Only 65 out of 206 proteins were found to be common for both in vivo and in vitro samples. Majority of the 55 proteins, which were solely detected in in vivo samples, were considered to be plasma derived. Eighty-six proteins were solely found from in vitro fibroblast-derived ECM, and most of them were related to matrix remodeling or growth factor action, proposing that the activation of fibroblasts in cell culture may remarkably modify their gene expression profile. Finally, in comparison to traditional 2D in vitro cell culture, the ECM composition of 3D spheroid culture was analyzed.

The aim of this study was to establish a platform that describes the early oncoproteomic response of human prostate tissue to radiation therapy (RT) using a prospective human tissue cohort.  Methods:   Fresh and fixed transperineal biopsies from eight men with clinically localized tumors were taken prior to and 14 days following a single fraction of high-dose-rate brachytherapy. Quantitative protein analysis was achieved using an optimized protein extraction pipeline and subsequent data-independent acquisition mass spectroscopy (DIA-MS). Ontology analyses were used to identify enriched functional pathways, with the candidates further interrogated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue biopsies from five additional patients.  Results:   We obtained a mean coverage of 5660 proteins from fresh tissue biopsies; with the principal post-radiation change observed being an increase in levels amongst a total of 49 proteins exhibiting abundance changes. Many of these changes in abundance varied between patients and, typically to prostate cancer tissue, exhibited a high level of heterogeneity. Ontological analysis revealed the enrichment of the protein activation cascades of three immunological pathways: humoral immune response, leukocyte mediated immunity and complement activation. These were predominantly associated with the extracellular space. We validated significant expression differences in between 20% and 61% of these candidates using the separate fixed-tissue cohort and established their feasibility as an experimental tissue resource by acquiring quantitative data for a mean of 5152 proteins per patient.  Discussion:   In this prospective study, we have established a sensitive and reliable oncoproteomic pipeline for the analysis of both fresh and formalin-fixed human PCa tissue. We identified multiple pathways known to be radiation-responsive and have established a powerful database of candidates and pathways with no current association with RT.

While validating the unfavorable intermediate-risk (UIR) and favorable intermediate-risk (FIR) stratifications among Johns Hopkins PCa patients treated with radiotherapy, we examined whether EOR-PSA could further risk stratify UIR men for survival.  Methods:   A total of 302 IR patients were identified in the Johns Hopkins PCa database (178 UIR, 124 FIR). Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable analysis was performed via Cox regression for biochemical recurrence free survival (bRFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS), while a competing risks model was used for PCa specific survival (PCSS). Among the 235 patients with known EOR-PSA values, we then stratified by EOR-PSA and performed the aforementioned analysis.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 11.5 years (138 months). UIR was predictive of worse DMFS and PCSS (P = 0.008 and P = 0.023) on multivariable analysis (MVA). Increased radiation dose was significant for improved DMFS (P = 0.016) on MVA. EOR-PSA was excluded from the models because it did not trend towards significance as a continuous or binary variable due to interaction with UIR, and we were unable to converge a multivariable model with a variable to control for this interaction. However, when stratifying by detectable versus undetectable EOR-PSA, UIR had worse DMFS and PCSS among detectable EOR-PSA patients, but not undetectable patients. UIR was significant on MVA among detectable EOR-PSA patients for DMFS (P = 0.021) and PCSS (P = 0.033), while RT dose also predicted PCSS (P = 0.013).

Our objective is to examine whether germline pathogenic CHEK2 mutations can differentiate risk of lethal from indolent PCa.  Methods:   A case-case study of 703 lethal PCa patients and 1455 patients with low-risk localized PCa of European, African, and Chinese origin was performed. Germline DNA samples from these patients were sequenced for CHEK2. Mutation carrier rates and their association with lethal PCa were analyzed using the Fisher exact test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.  Results:   In the entire study population, 40 (1.85%) patients were identified as carrying one of 15 different germline CHEK2 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations. CHEK2 mutations were detected in 16 (2.28%) of 703 lethal PCa patients compared with 24 (1.65%) of 1455 low-risk PCa patients (P = 0.31). No association was found between CHEK2 mutation status and early-diagnosis or PCa-specific survival time. However, the most common mutation in CHEK2, c.1100delC (p.T367 fs), had a significantly higher carrier rate (1.28%) in lethal PCa patients than low-risk PCa patients of European American origin (0.16%), P = 0.0038. The estimated Odds Ratio of this mutation for lethal PCa was 7.86. The carrier rate in lethal PCa was also significantly higher than that (0.46%) in 32 461 non-Finnish European subjects from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) (P = 0.01).

Materials and methods:   In this phase II trial of patients with high-risk prostate cancer, Image Guided SIB-IMRT plans (Simultaneous Intensity Modulated - Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy) were delivered between 2009 and 2012. All patients enrolled (41) received in 25 fractions a total dose of 67.5 Gy (2.7 Gy/fraction) to the prostatic volume, 56.25 Gy (2.25 Gy/fraction) to the seminal vescicles, and 50 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction) to the pelvic lymph nodes (LN) chains with concurrent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) procedure was performed using three gold seeds.

Objective:   To determine the long-term risk of prostate cancer mortality using kallikrein blood markers measured at baseline in a large population of healthy men to identify men with low risk for prostate cancer death.  Design, setting, participants:   Study based on the Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort enrolling 11 506 unscreened men aged 45-73 yr during 1991-1996, providing cryopreserved blood at enrollment and followed without PSA screening to December 31, 2014. We measured four kallikrein markers in the blood of 1223 prostate cancer cases and 3028 controls.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Prostate cancer death (n=317) by PSA and a prespecified statistical model based on the levels of four kallikrein markers.  Results and limitations:   Baseline PSA predicted prostate cancer death with a concordance index of 0.86. In men with elevated PSA (≥2.0ng/ml), predictive accuracy was enhanced by the four-kallikrein panel compared with PSA (0.80 vs 0.73; improvement 0.07; 95% confidence interval 0.04, 0.10). Nearly half of men aged 60+ yr with elevated PSA had a four-kallikrein panel score of <7.5%, translating into 1.7% risk of prostate cancer death at 15 yr-a similar estimate to that of a man with a PSA of 1.6ng/ml. Men with a four-kallikrein panel score of ≥7.5% had a 13% risk of prostate cancer death at 15 yr.  Conclusions:   A prespecified statistical model based on four kallikrein markers (commercially available as the 4Kscore) reclassified many men with modestly elevated PSA, to have a low long-term risk of prostate cancer death. Men with elevated PSA but low scores from the four-kallikrein panel can be monitored rather than being subject to biopsy.

Methods:   For a collective of 40 prostate patients, the isocenter was shifted back appropriately to the applied table shifts after positioning verification, simulating that no positioning correction had been performed and the treatment plans were recalculated. All the treatment fractions with the appropriate isocenter-shifts were added to yield a new plan considering two scenarios:Afterwards all plans were analysed and compared with each other regarding target coverage, sparing of organs at risk (OAR) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP).  Results:   Dose distributions and especially DVH show a deterioration of the target-coverage caused by the positioning inaccuracy. Deviations in dose at a single point can reach values of over 10 Gy. In single cases minimum plan agreement only achieved 66% pass within 3% local dose for the realistic case. Organs at risk and NTCP analysis result in a slightly better sparing of the rectum.

CTV-to-PTV margins determined from all CBCTs were 14 mm in the AP, 10 mm in the LL and 9-9.5 mm in the SI directions for the prostate and the gynecological groups and 9.5-10.5 mm in AP, 9 mm in LL and 8-10 mm in the SI direction for the prostate bed and the rectum/anal canal groups. If assessed on the basis of the first 3 CBCTs, the calculated CTV-to-PTV margins were slightly larger.  Conclusions:   without IGRT, large CTV-to-PTV margins up to 15 mm are required to account for inter-fraction tumor localization errors.

Materials and methods:   The PDM was applied to the rectum contours that were delineated on planning computed tomography (CT) and cone-beam CT (CBCT) at 80 fractions of 11 patients. The standard deviations (SDs) of systematic and random errors of the shape variations of the whole rectum and the region in which the rectum overlapped with the PTV (ROP regions) were derived from the PDMs at all fractions of each patient. The systematic error was derived by using the PDMs of planning and average rectum surface determined from rectum surfaces at all fractions, while the random error was derived by using a PDM-based covariance matrix at all fractions of each patient.  Results:   Regarding whole rectum, the population SDs were larger than 1.0 mm along all directions for random error, and along the anterior, superior, and inferior directions for systematic error. The deviation is largest along the superior and inferior directions for systematic and random errors, respectively. For ROP regions, the population SDs of systematic error were larger than 1.0 mm along the superior and inferior directions. The population SDs of random error for the ROP regions were larger than 1.0 mm except along the right and posterior directions.

Combined loss of EAF2 and p53 in a murine model induced prostate tumors, and concurrent knockdown of EAF2 and p53 in prostate cancer cells enhanced proliferation and migration, further suggesting that EAF2 and p53 could functionally interact in the suppression of prostate tumorigenesis. Here, RNA-seq analyses identified differentially regulated genes in response to concurrent knockdown of p53 and EAF2. Several of these genes were associated with the STAT3 signaling pathway, and this was verified by significantly increased p-STAT3 immunostaining in the Eaf2-/-p53-/- mouse prostate. STAT3 knockdown abrogated the stimulation of C4-2 cell proliferation by concurrent knockdown of EAF2 and p53.

However, docetaxel resistance inhibits the therapeutic effect of this agent, thus investigating the mechanism of chemoresistance to docetaxel of PCa may help to improve the prognosis of PCa patients. In our present study, we found that miR-223-3p was up-regulated in PCa cell lines (C4-2, LNCap, PC3, DU-145). Transfection with miR-223-3p inhibitor increased chemo-sensitivity to docetaxel and cell apoptosis rate in PCa cells compared with docetaxel + miR-223-3p mock group, especially in DU-145 cells which were more resistant to docetaxel. Bioinformatics study and luciferase reporter assay indicated that FOXO3 was a target of miR-223-3p and the results from western blot suggested that FOXO3 was negatively regulated by miR-223-3p. Further study revealed that up-regulation of FOXO3 by transfection with pCMV-FOXO3 decreased the IC50 values of docetaxel and increased cell apoptosis rate compared with docetaxel + pCMV-vector group, suggesting that overexpressed FOXO3 suppressed cell survival and sensitized PCa cells to docetaxel. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of FOXO3 abolished the effects of miR-223-3p inhibitor on chemo-sensitivity and apoptosis in PCa cells by increasing chemoresistance and decreasing cell apoptosis rate. Finally, the in vivo experiments showed that miR-223-3p inhibitor sensitized prostatic cancer mouse model to docetaxel by increasing the expression of FOXO3. In conclusion, our present study indicated that miR-223-3p regulated cell chemo-sensitivity by targeting FOXO3 in prostatic cancer both in vitro and in vivo, providing new potential therapeutic strategy for PCa treatment.""","""['Qiang Feng', 'Peng He', 'Yu Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Gene""","""['FOXO3a and Its Regulators in Prostate Cancer.', 'miR-27b and miR-34a enhance docetaxel sensitivity of prostate cancer cells through inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by targeting ZEB1.', 'Knockdown of lncRNA CCAT1 enhances sensitivity of paclitaxel in prostate cancer via regulating miR-24-3p and FSCN1.', 'miR-375 induces docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by targeting SEC23A and YAP1.', 'Nanoways to overcome docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'FOXO3a and Its Regulators in Prostate Cancer.', 'miR-92a promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of prostate cancer cells through the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.', 'MicroRNAs as Epigenetic Determinants of Treatment Response and Potential Therapeutic Targets in Prostate Cancer.', 'FOXO3 is targeted by miR-223-3p and promotes osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells by enhancing autophagy.', 'MiR-940 promotes malignant progression of breast cancer by regulating FOXO3.']"""

Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective, single institution analysis of men who underwent fusion biopsy. Men with prior positive biopsies, magnetic resonance imaging performed elsewhere and/or magnetic resonance imaging prior to release of the PI-RADS™ (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) version 2 were excluded from study, resulting in 381 participants. Modeled independent variables included patient age, number of regions of interest with a PI-RADS categorization of 3 or greater, body mass index, prostate specific antigen, prostate volume and PI-RADS categorization. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with finding clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason 7 or greater) on biopsy.  Results:   Median age was 67.2 years (IQR (61.6-73.0) and median prostate specific antigen was 6.6 ng/ml (5.0-10.0). Adjusted analysis demonstrated that age (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.15, p ≤0.001), body mass index (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16, p = 0.038) and prostate specific antigen (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.10, p = 0.015) were associated with detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.

This study examined the association between serum PSA levels, which is a risk factor for prostate cancer, and variants in some melanoma-associated pigmentary genes.  Methods:   We studied participants, all aged 70+ years, in the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project who had no history of prostatitis or received treatment for prostate disease (n = 1033). We genotyped variants in MC1R (rs1805007, rs1805008), ASIP (rs4911414, rs1015362), SLC45A2 (rs28777, rs16891982), IRF4 (rs12203592), TYRP1 (rs1408799), TYR (rs1126809, rs1042602), SLC24A2 (rs12896399), and OCA2 (rs7495174). Generalised linear dominant models with Poisson distribution, log link functions and robust variance estimators estimated adjusted percentage differences (%PSA) in mean serum PSA levels (ng/mL) between variant and wildtype (0%PSA = reference) genotypes, adjusting for age, body mass index, serum 25OHD levels and birth regions (Australia or New Zealand (ANZ), Europe or elsewhere).  Results:   Serum PSA levels were strongly associated with advancing age and birth regions: mean PSA levels were lower in Europe-born (-29.7%) and elsewhere-born (-11.7%) men than ANZ-born men (reference). Lower %PSA was observed in men with variants in SLC45A2: rs28777 (-19.6;95%CI: -33.5, -2.7), rs16891982 (-17.3;95%CI:-30.4,-1.7) than in wildtype men (reference). There were significant interactions between birth regions and PSA levels in men with variants in MC1R (rs1805007; p-interaction = 0.0001) and ASIP (rs4911414; p-interaction = 0.007). For these genes %PSA was greater in ANZ-born men and lower in Europe- and elsewhere-born men with the variant than it was in wildtype men. In a post hoc analysis, serum testosterone levels were increased in men with MC1R rs1805007 and serum dihydrotestosterone in men with ASIP rs1015362.  Conclusion:   Men with SNPs in SLC45A2, who have less sun sensitive skin, have lower PSA levels. Men with SNPs in MC1R and ASIP, who have more sun sensitive skin, and were born in ANZ, have higher PSA levels.

Study type:   Analytic retrospective study.  Population:   In all, 52 men with biological suspected PCa recurrence after radiotherapy were retrospectively included.  Field strength/sequence:   All men underwent prostatic MRI (1.5T or 3T), including T2 W, DWI, and DCE imagings, before biopsies.  Assessment:   Two junior (6 months' experience) and two senior readers (more than 3 years' experience) independently assigned a Likert score for each prostatic sextant on T2 W+DW+DCE imagings, then on T2 W+DW imagings, 4 weeks later.  Statistical tests:   The reference standard was prostatic biopsies. For two levels of positivity of Likert score, 3/5 and 4/5, sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), and interreader agreement were compared.  Results:   T2 W+DWI+DCE and T2 W+DWI imaging had similar AUC at lobe and sextant level (0.853-0.946 vs. 0.819-0.955, P from 0.071-0.534). Using a Likert score ≥4/5, T2 W+DWI+DCE significantly improved the sensitivity for junior readers at the patient, lobe, and sextant level (40-80% vs. 22-66%, P < 0.0001-0.041). Sensitivity was not significantly modified with DCE imaging for senior readers (54-95% vs. 50-91%, P from 0.074-1).

Methods:   We directly compared a custom-developed VERT teaching module with a standard teaching module with respect to the understanding of treatment planning concepts using a cross-over design. Students self-reported their understanding of specific concepts before and after delivery of the VERT and standard teaching modules and evaluated aspects of VERT as a learning experience. In addition, teaching staff participated in a semi-structured interview discussing the modules from an educational perspective.  Results:   Both the standard teaching module and VERT teaching module enhanced conceptual understanding and level of confidence in the student cohort after both teaching periods. The proportion of students reporting a perceived increase in knowledge/confidence was similar for the VERT teaching module for all but two scenarios. We propose that an integrated approach, providing a strong theoretical conceptual framework, followed by VERT to situate this framework in the (simulated) clinical environment combines the best of both teaching approaches.

Asian American patients were less likely than White patients to report that their doctors asked them to help decide a treatment plan (OR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.18-0.53) and that they worked out a treatment plan with their doctors (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.33-0.90). Language of interview was a significant contributing factor in stratified analysis for both outcomes.  Conclusion:   Asian American prostate cancer patients reported less engagement in treatment decision-making, with Chinese language being a significant contributing factor.

However, a significant inter-individual and inter-tumor variability exists among different cancers. The expression of the toxins granzyme A (GZMA) and perforin 1 (PRF1), secreted by effector cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, were recently used as a denominator of the intratumoral immune cytolytic activity (CYT). These levels are significantly elevated upon CD8+ T-cell activation as well as during a productive clinical response against immune-checkpoint blockade therapies. Still, it is not completely understood how different tumors induce and adapt to immune responses.  Methods:   Here, we calculated the CYT across different cancer types and focused on differences between primary and metastatic tumors. Using data from 10,355, primary tumor resection samples and 2,787 normal samples that we extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression project databases, we screened the variation of CYT across 32 different cancer types and 28 different normal tissue types. We correlated the cytolytic levels in each cancer type with the corresponding patient group's overall survival, the expression of several immune-checkpoint molecules, as well as with the load of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) in these tumors.  Results:   We found diverse levels of CYT across different cancer types, with highest levels in kidney, lung, and cervical cancers, and lowest levels in glioma, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), and uveal melanoma. GZMA protein was either lowly expressed or absent in at least half of these tumors; whereas PRF1 protein was not detected in almost any of the different tumor types, analyzing tissue microarrays from 20 different tumor types. CYT was significantly higher in metastatic skin melanoma and correlated significantly to the TIL load. In TCGA-ACC, skin melanoma, and bladder cancer, CYT was associated with an improved patient outcome and high levels of both GZMA and PRF1 synergistically affected patient survival in these cancers. In bladder, breast, colon, esophageal, kidney, ovarian, pancreatic, testicular, and thyroid cancers, high CYT was accompanied by upregulation of at least one immune-checkpoint molecule, indicating that similar to melanoma and prostate cancer, immune responses in cytolytic-high tumors elicit immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment.  Conclusion:   Overall, our data highlight the existence of diverse levels of CYT across different cancer types and suggest that along with the existence of complicated associations among various tumor-infiltrated immune cells, it is capable to promote or inhibit the establishment of a permissive tumor microenvironment, depending on the cancer type. High levels of immunosuppression seem to exist in several tumor types.""","""['Constantinos Roufas', 'Dimitrios Chasiotis', 'Anestis Makris', 'Christodoulos Efstathiades', 'Christos Dimopoulos', 'Apostolos Zaravinos']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Cytolytic Activity Score to Assess Anticancer Immunity in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Distinct genomic features across cytolytic subgroups in skin melanoma.', 'Cytolytic activity correlates with the mutational burden and deregulated expression of immune checkpoints in colorectal cancer.', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes and Their Prognostic Value in Cutaneous Melanoma.', 'Checkpoint molecules on infiltrating immune cells in colorectal tumor microenvironment.', 'Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing identifies a signature based on T-cell marker genes to predict prognosis and immunotherapy response in bladder cancer.', 'Classification related to immunogenic cell death predicts prognosis, immune microenvironment characteristics, and response to immunotherapy in lower-grade gliomas.', 'Human lymphocytes mobilized with exercise have an anti-tumor transcriptomic profile and exert enhanced graft-versus-leukemia effects in xenogeneic mice.', 'Omics analysis of uveal melanoma: Leukocyte gene signatures reveal novel survival distinctions and indicate a prognostic role for cytolytic activity scoring.', 'Mass Spectrometry-Based Biomarkers to Detect Prostate Cancer: A Multicentric Study Based on Non-Invasive Urine Collection without Prior Digital Rectal Examination.']"""

Silibinin is a natural polyphenolic flavonoid with anti-cancer activity. We assessed the effects of silibinin on cell viability, maspin and ERα gene expression in MCF-7 cell line.  Methods:   The human MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) and treated with different concentrations of silibinin (100-600 μg/mL) for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The cytotoxic effect of silibinin on MCF-7 viability was determined using Methyl-Thiazolyl-Tetrazolium (MTT) assay by IC50 determination. The fold changes of Maspin and ERα expression were determined by reverse-transcription real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). All experiments on the cells were performed in triplicates.  Results:   The maximum inhibitory effect of silibinin on cell viability was observed at 600 μg/mL after 72-hour incubation (p = 0.001). Incubation of the cells with silibinin for 48 and 72 hours significantly decreased IC50 values to 250 and 207 μg/mL (p = 0.005 and p= 0.006), respectively. The expression of maspin and ERα in the treated cells compared to controls was significantly decreased following treatment with different concentrations of silibinin during a 24-hour period.  Conclusions:   Silibinin reduces both maspin and ERα gene expression in MCF-7 cell line. The therapeutic effect of silibinin on the treatment of breast cancer may be mediated by the reduction of ERα expression. For verifying this hypothesis and the possible therapeutic implication of silibinin on breast cancer, further studies in this direction are necessary.""","""['Maryam Karimi', 'Hossein Babaahmadi-Rezaei', 'Ghorban Mohammadzadeh', 'Mohammad-Ali Ghaffari']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Iran J Pathol""","""['Crosstalk of ROS/RNS and autophagy in silibinin-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in vitro.', 'ERα down-regulation plays a key role in silibinin-induced autophagy and apoptosis in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.', 'Combination of Silibinin and Curcumin Reduced Leptin Receptor Expression in MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cell Line.', 'Comparative Evaluation of Silibinin Effects on Cell Cycling and Apoptosis in Human Breast Cancer MCF-7 and T47D Cell Lines.', 'Silibinin enhances ultraviolet B-induced apoptosis in mcf-7 human breast cancer cells.', 'Mechanistic evaluation of phytochemicals in breast cancer remedy: current understanding and future perspectives.', 'Tioconazole and Chloroquine Act Synergistically to Combat Doxorubicin-Induced Toxicity via Inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Mediated ROS-Dependent Apoptosis and Autophagic Flux Inhibition in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Maspin suppresses cell invasion and migration in gastric cancer through inhibiting EMT and angiogenesis via ITGB1/FAK pathway.', 'Natural Products for the Management and Prevention of Breast Cancer.']"""

We show here that the bone microenvironment confers dormancy to C4-2B4 prostate cancer cells, as they become dormant when injected into mouse femurs but not under the skin. Live-cell imaging of dormant cells at the single-cell level revealed that conditioned medium from differentiated, but not undifferentiated, osteoblasts induced C4-2B4 cellular quiescence, suggesting that differentiated osteoblasts present locally around the tumor cells in the bone conferred dormancy to prostate cancer cells. Gene array analyses identified GDF10 and TGFβ2 among osteoblast-secreted proteins that induced quiescence of C4-2B4, C4-2b, and PC3-mm2, but not 22RV1 or BPH-1 cells, indicating prostate cancer tumor cells differ in their dormancy response. TGFβ2 and GDF10 induced dormancy through TGFβRIII to activate phospho-p38MAPK, which phosphorylates retinoblastoma (RB) at the novel N-terminal S249/T252 sites to block prostate cancer cell proliferation. Consistently, expression of dominant-negative p38MAPK in C4-2b and C4-2B4 prostate cancer cell lines abolished tumor cell dormancy both in vitro and in vivo Lower TGFβRIII expression in patients with prostate cancer correlated with increased metastatic potential and decreased survival rates. Together, our results identify a dormancy mechanism by which DTCs are induced into a dormant state through TGFβRIII-p38MAPK-pS249/pT252-RB signaling and offer a rationale for developing strategies to prevent prostate cancer recurrence in the bone.Significance: These findings provide mechanistic insights into the dormancy of metastatic prostate cancer in the bone and offer a rationale for developing strategies to prevent prostate cancer recurrence in the bone.

Results:   Subjects with increased fatigue during EBRT reported a significant decline in cognitive function and had difficulties with CAMCI®'s route finding and item recall tasks during EBRT. Increased fatigue during EBRT was associated with perceived cognitive difficulties in executive function and recognition memory, but not with attention or verbal memory.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that there might be specific cognitive domains that are associated with increased fatigue during EBRT.

Methods:   A case-control study design used to select 545 patients from the Mayo clinic tumor registry who underwent radical prostatectomy. A training set from this cohort (n = 359) was used to build a 10-gene model, based on high-dimensional discriminant analysis (HDDA10) to predict several endpoints of clinical patients' outcome. An independent set (n = 219) from the same institution was used as validation set.  Results:   HDDA10 showed significant performance for predicting metastasis (Mets) (AUC 0.68, p = 6.4E - 6) and biochemical recurrence (BCR) (AUC = 0.65, p = 0.003) in the validation set outperforming Gleason grade grouping (GG) for BCR (AUC 0.57, p = 0.03) and with comparable performance for Mets endpoint (GG AUC 0.66, p = 8.1E - 5). HDDA10 prognostic significance was superior to any clinical-pathological parameter within GG2 + 3 (GS7) patients achieving an AUC of 0.74 (p = 0.0037) for BCR compared to Gleason pattern 4 (AUC 0.64) (p = 0.015) and AUC for Mets of 0.68 versus AUC of 0.65 for Gleason pattern 4 (p = 0.01). HDDA10 remained significant for both BCR and Mets in multivariate analysis, suggesting that it can be used to increase accuracy in stratifying patients eligible for active surveillance.  Conclusion:   HDDA10 is of added value to GG and other clinical-pathological parameters in predicting BCR and Mets endpoint, especially in the low to intermediate patients' risk groups.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists used in prostate cancer treatment can induce testosterone deficiency but its effects on bone in preclinical male osteoporosis model are less studied. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the skeletal effect of buserelin (a GnRH agonist) in male rats and compare it with orchidectomy. Methods: Forty-six three-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three experimental arms. The baseline arm (n=6) was sacrificed at the onset of the study. In the buserelin arm, the rats received a daily subcutaneous injection of either normal saline (n=8), buserelin acetate at 25 µg/kg (n=8) or 75 µg/kg (n=8). In the orchidectomy arm, the rats were either sham-operated (n=8) or orchidectomized (n=8). All groups underwent in-vivo X-ray micro-computed tomography scanning at the left proximal tibia every month. Blood was collected at the beginning and the end of the study for testosterone level evaluation. The rats were euthanized after the three-month treatment. The femurs were harvested for biomechanical strength and bone calcium determination. Results: The results showed that buserelin at both doses caused a significant decline in testosterone level and deterioration in bone microstructure (p<0.05), but did not affect bone calcium content (p>0.05). Buserelin at 25 µg/kg decreased displacement and strain of the femur significantly (p<0.05). Similar changes were observed in the orchidectomized group compared to the sham-operated group but without any significant changes in biomechanical strength (p>0.05). Conclusion: Buserelin can induce testosterone deficiency and the associated deterioration of bone microarchitecture similar to orchidectomy in three months.

The Cub-Domain Containing Protein-1, CDCP1, is a transmembrane glycoprotein which regulates cell adhesion. Overexpression and loss of CDCP1 have been observed in the same cancer types to promote metastatic progression. Here, we demonstrate reduced CDCP1 expression in high-grade, primary prostate cancers, circulating tumor cells and tumor metastases of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. CDCP1 is expressed in epithelial and not mesenchymal cells, and its cell surface and mRNA expression declines upon stimulation with TGFβ1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Silencing of CDCP1 in DU145 and PC3 cells resulted in 3.4-fold higher proliferation of non-adherent cells and 4.4-fold greater anchorage independent growth. CDCP1-silenced tumors grew in 100% of mice, compared to 30% growth of CDCP1-expressing tumors. After CDCP1 silencing, cell adhesion and migration diminished 2.1-fold, caused by loss of inside-out activation of β1-integrin. We determined that the loss of CDCP1 reduces CDK5 kinase activity due to the phosphorylation of its regulatory subunit, CDK5R1/p35, by c-SRC on Y234. This generates a binding site for the C2 domain of PKCδ, which in turn phosphorylates CDK5 on T77. The resulting dissociation of the CDK5R1/CDK5 complex abolishes the activity of CDK5. Mutations of CDK5-T77 and CDK5R1-Y234 phosphorylation sites re-establish the CDK5/CDKR1 complex and the inside-out activity of β1-integrin. Altogether, we discovered a new mechanism of regulation of CDK5 through loss of CDCP1, which dynamically regulates β1-integrin in non-adherent cells and which may promote vascular dissemination in patients with advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Sara G Pollan', 'Fangjin Huang', 'Jamie M Sperger', 'Joshua M Lang', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Anne E Cress', 'C Y Chu', 'Neil A Bhowmick', 'Sungyong You', 'Michael R Freeman', 'Danislav S Spassov', 'Mark M Moasser', 'William G Carter', 'Shakti Ranjan Satapathy', 'Kavita Shah', 'Beatrice S Knudsen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['In vivo cleaved CDCP1 promotes early tumor dissemination via complexing with activated β1 integrin and induction of FAK/PI3K/Akt motility signaling.', 'CUB-domain-containing protein 1 overexpression in solid cancers promotes cancer cell growth by activating Src family kinases.', 'CUB domain-containing protein 1, a prognostic factor for human pancreatic cancers, promotes cell migration and extracellular matrix degradation.', 'Roles of CUB domain-containing protein 1 signaling in cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'The CDCP1 Signaling Hub: A Target for Cancer Detection and Therapeutic Intervention.', 'Influence of extracellular matrix composition on tumour cell behaviour in a biomimetic in vitro model for hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Loss of CDCP1 triggers FAK activation in detached prostate cancer cells.', 'CDCP1 on Dendritic Cells Contributes to the Development of a Model of Kawasaki Disease.', 'Extracellular matrix and its therapeutic potential for cancer treatment.', 'Substrate-biased activity-based probes identify proteases that cleave receptor CDCP1.']"""

Treatment with gluconate specifically blocked pmCiC and decreased tumor growth in murine xenografts of human pancreatic cancer. This treatment altered metabolism within tumors, including fatty acid metabolism. High expression of pmCiC was associated with invasion and advanced tumor stage across many human cancers.

Results:   Men who completed high school only were statistically significantly more likely to have a higher prostate cancer grade than those with a bachelor's degree or higher. However, there was no dose-response effect across educational strata. Retirees were 30% less likely to have higher grade tumors compared to those who were employed.  Conclusions:   SES differences among black men did not fully explain the high grade of prostate cancer.

Rho GTPases regulate cell migration, but a comprehensive analysis of how each Rho signalling component affects migration has not been carried out.  Results:   Through an RNA interference screen, and using a prostate cancer cell line, we find that approximately 25% of Rho network components alter migration. Some genes enhance migration while others decrease basal and/or hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated migration. Surprisingly, we identify RhoH as a screen hit. RhoH expression is normally restricted to haematopoietic cells, but we find it is expressed in multiple epithelial cancer cell lines. High RhoH expression in samples from prostate cancer patients correlates with earlier relapse. RhoH depletion reduces cell speed and persistence and decreases migratory polarity. Rac1 activity normally localizes to the front of migrating cells at areas of dynamic membrane movement, but in RhoH-depleted cells active Rac1 is localised around the whole cell periphery and associated with membrane regions that are not extending or retracting. RhoH interacts with Rac1 and with several p21-activated kinases (PAKs), which are Rac effectors. Similar to RhoH depletion, PAK2 depletion increases cell spread area and reduces cell migration. In addition, RhoH depletion reduces lamellipodium extension induced by PAK2 overexpression.  Conclusions:   We describe a novel role for RhoH in prostate cancer cell migration. We propose that RhoH promotes cell migration by coupling Rac1 activity and PAK2 to membrane protrusion. Our results also suggest that RhoH expression levels correlate with prostate cancer progression.""","""['Virginia Tajadura-Ortega', 'Ritu Garg', 'Richard Allen', 'Claudia Owczarek', 'Michael D Bright', 'Samuel Kean', 'Aisyah Mohd-Noor', 'Anita Grigoriadis', 'Timothy C Elston', 'Klaus M Hahn', 'Anne J Ridley']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Biol""","""['RhoH, a hematopoietic-specific Rho GTPase, regulates proliferation, survival, migration, and engraftment of hematopoietic progenitor cells.', 'Novel role of Giα2 in cell migration: Downstream of PI3-kinase-AKT and Rac1 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Cross-talk between RhoH and Rac1 in regulation of actin cytoskeleton and chemotaxis of hematopoietic progenitor cells.', 'Hematopoietic-specific Rho GTPases Rac2 and RhoH and human blood disorders.', 'The role of small GTPases of the Rho/Rac family in TGF-β-induced EMT and cell motility in cancer.', 'Prognostic prediction of lung adenocarcinoma by integrative analysis of RHOH expression and methylation.', 'Actin cytoskeleton in angiogenesis.', 'Activation of neural lineage networks and ARHGEF2 in enzalutamide-resistant and neuroendocrine prostate cancer and association with patient outcomes.', 'Nascent RHOH acts as a molecular brake on actomyosin-mediated effector functions of inflammatory neutrophils.', 'Bimodal expression of RHOH during myelomonocytic differentiation: Implications for the expansion of AML differentiation therapy.']"""

The APC gene methylation status was also investigated. As in human prostate cancer, cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin, which are fundamental for activating the canonical WNT pathway, were found in canine prostate cancer and metastasis. Membranous E-cadherin was also lost in these lesions, allowing cellular migration to the stroma and nuclear localization of β-catenin. In contrast to human prostate tumours, no APC downregulation or hypermethylation was found in canine prostate cancer.

The novel compound along with that previously described RRuRN-(1S,4R)-[(η6-p-cymene)Ru{ĸNH(Bn),ĸNOH}Cl]Cl (1a) was evaluated by polarimetry, ultra-violet and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The structure of novel ruthenium derivative 1a' was determined by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Both enantiomers have been tested against several cancer cell lines in vitro: prostate PC-3, lung A-549, pancreas MIA PaCa-2, colorectal HCT-116, leukemia Jurkat and cervical HeLa. Both enantiomers are active and versatile cytotoxic agents, showing IC50 values from 2 to 12 times lower than those found for cisplatin in the different cell lines evaluated. The mechanism of cell death induced by the metal compounds was analyzed in A-549 and Jurkat cell lines. Derivatives 1a and 1a' induced apoptotic cell death of A-549 cells while dose-dependent cell death mechanisms have been found in the Jurkat cell line. Compound-DNA interactions have been investigated by equilibrium dialysis, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) melting assays and viscometric titrations, revealing moderate binding affinity of 1a and 1a' towards duplex DNA. Finally, the efficacy of 1a in a preliminary in vivo assay of PC-3 xenografts in nude mice has been evaluated, resulting in a promising inhibition of tumor growth by 45%.

To overcome this challenge, we developed a method to remove confounding effects by calculating the principal components that span the space of the latent factors. Another intriguing findings of our study is that there could be both positive and negative associations between SCNA and DNA methylation, while the CpGs with negative/positive associations with SCNA are often located around CpG islands/ocean, respectively.

CHD1 knockout cells show reduced H2AX phosphorylation (γH2AX) and foci formation as well as impairments in CtIP recruitment to the damaged sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation following a single DSB shows that the reduced levels of γH2AX accumulation at DSBs in CHD1-KO cells are due to both a global reduction in H2AX incorporation and poor retention of H2AX at the DSBs. We also identified a unique N-terminal region of CHD1 that inhibits the DNA binding, ATPase, and chromatin assembly and remodeling activities of CHD1. CHD1 lacking the N terminus was more active in rescuing the defects in γH2AX formation and CtIP recruitment in CHD1-KO cells than full-length CHD1, suggesting the N terminus is a negative regulator in cells.

Because these tumors are often screen-detected, these inverse associations could be driven by HIV-related differences in utilization of cancer screening.  Methods:   We ascertained incident breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer in PLWHA using data from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study (1996-2012). Comparisons with general population cancer rates were made using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), overall and stratified by tumor stage/size, breast cancer estrogen receptor status, and colorectal site. We also examined the potential effect of study design and unmeasured confounding on inverse standardized incidence ratios.  Results:   Compared with the general population, PLWHA had lower rates of invasive breast (SIR = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58 to 0.68), prostate (SIR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.51), proximal colon (SIR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.59 to 0.75), distal colon (SIR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.59), and rectal cancers (SIR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.61 to 0.77). Reduced risk persisted across tumor stage/size for prostate and colorectal cancers. Although distant-stage breast cancer rates were not reduced (SIR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.73 to 1.20), HIV-infected women had lower rates of large (>5 cm) breast tumors (SIR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.50 to 0.83). The magnitude of these inverse standardized incidence ratios could not plausibly be attributed to case underascertainment, out-migration, or unmeasured confounding.  Conclusions:   Breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates are markedly lower among PLWHA, including rates of distant-stage/large tumors that are not generally screen-detected. This set of inverse HIV-cancer associations is therefore unlikely to be due primarily to differential screening and may instead represent biological relationships requiring future investigation.""","""['Anna E Coghill', 'Eric A Engels', 'Maria J Schymura', 'Parag Mahale', 'Meredith S Shiels']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Opportunities to Understand Unique Cancer Risks in Global HIV-Infected Populations.', 'Circulating 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentration and Risk of Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancers: The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study.', 'Risk of prostate, breast and colorectal cancer after skin cancer diagnosis.', 'Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer as a Second Primary Among Patients With Previous Malignancy: Who Is at Risk?', 'Utility of polygenic risk scores in UK cancer screening: a modelling analysis.', 'Risk of Colorectal Cancer and Associated Mortality in HIV: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Preoperative Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) as a prognostic inflammation biomarker in Asian HIV-infected patients with gastric cancer: a single-center study.', 'Antigenic molecular mimicry in viral-mediated protection from cancer: the HIV case.', 'The Viral Origin of Human Breast Cancer: From the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) to the Human Betaretrovirus (HBRV).', 'Incidence and mortality of non-AIDS-defining cancers among people living with HIV: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Cancer Incidence Among Adults With HIV in a Population-Based Cohort in Korea.']"""

The protocol provides the only direct, randomised comparative data of SOC + AAP versus SOC + DocP.  Method:   Recruitment to SOC + DocP and SOC + AAP overlapped November 2011 to March 2013. SOC was long-term ADT or, for most non-metastatic cases, ADT for ≥2 years and RT to the primary tumour. Stratified randomisation allocated pts 2 : 1 : 2 to SOC; SOC + docetaxel 75 mg/m2 3-weekly×6 + prednisolone 10 mg daily; or SOC + abiraterone acetate 1000 mg + prednisolone 5 mg daily. AAP duration depended on stage and intent to give radical RT. The primary outcome measure was death from any cause. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards and flexible parametric models, adjusted for stratification factors. This was not a formally powered comparison. A hazard ratio (HR) <1 favours SOC + AAP, and HR > 1 favours SOC + DocP.  Results:   A total of 566 consenting patients were contemporaneously randomised: 189 SOC + DocP and 377 SOC + AAP. The patients, balanced by allocated treatment were: 342 (60%) M1; 429 (76%) Gleason 8-10; 449 (79%) WHO performance status 0; median age 66 years and median PSA 56 ng/ml. With median follow-up 4 years, 149 deaths were reported. For overall survival, HR = 1.16 (95% CI 0.82-1.65); failure-free survival HR = 0.51 (95% CI 0.39-0.67); progression-free survival HR = 0.65 (95% CI 0.48-0.88); metastasis-free survival HR = 0.77 (95% CI 0.57-1.03); prostate cancer-specific survival HR = 1.02 (0.70-1.49); and symptomatic skeletal events HR = 0.83 (95% CI 0.55-1.25).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can be used not only for the biochemical profiling of the individual, but also, being living cells, can provide insights into the individuals response to ionizing radiation exposure.  Materials and methods:   The present study attempts to link the biochemical profile of lymphocytes within PBMCs obtained through Raman spectroscopy to in vitro measures of low-dose (<0.5Gy) DNA damage response and cytogenetic metrics of radiosensitivity in a cohort of healthy controls and prostate cancer patients (from CTRIAL-IE(ICORG) 08-17, NCT00951535). All parallel metrics to the Raman spectra of the cells were obtained ex vivo in cycling peripheral blood lymphocytes, with radiosensitivity estimated using the G2 chromosomal assay and DNA damage assessed using γH2AX fluorescence. Spectra from a total of 26 healthy volunteers and 22 prostate cancer patients were obtained.  Results:   The links between both measures of cellular response to ionizing radiation and the Raman spectra were modeled using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support-vector regression (SVR). It was found that neither regression approach could predict radiation-induced G2 score well, but could predict γH2AX MFI with the SVR outperforming PLSR, implying a non-linear relationship between spectral measurements and measures of DNA damage.

ROC curve analysis was performed to test the diagnostic accuracy of early versus delayed PSMA uptake (measured as maximum standardized uptake value [SUV]). A multiple-ROI analysis was done to obtain ROCs for combined PET SUV and multiparametric MRI datasets. Spearman analysis was performed to assess the correlations.  Results:   There was a significant difference between early and delayed PSMA uptake in malignant prostatic lesions (p < 0.01), which was able to characterize prostate lesions with an AUC of 0.83 and 0.94.

Here, a nanodevice is reported to uniquely use alterable alternating current electrohydrodynamic (ac-EHD) forces to enhance probe-target hybridization prior to direct native RNA target detection, without target amplification or surface functionalization. To exemplify clinical applicability, noninvasive screening of next-generation prostate cancer (PCa) RNA biomarkers (of different types) in patient urine samples is performed.

However, cancer cells have evolved mechanisms to usurp inflammatory cytokines to promote tumor progression. In particular, the inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1), is elevated in prostate cancer (PCa) patient tissue and serum, and promotes PCa bone metastasis. IL-1 also represses androgen receptor (AR) accumulation and activity in PCa cells, yet the cells remain viable and tumorigenic; suggesting that IL-1 may also contribute to AR-targeted therapy resistance. Furthermore, IL-1 and AR protein levels negatively correlate in PCa tumor cells. Taken together, we hypothesize that IL-1 reprograms AR positive (AR+ ) PCa cells into AR negative (AR- ) PCa cells that co-opt IL-1 signaling to ensure AR-independent survival and tumor progression in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment.  Methods:   LNCaP and PC3 PCa cells were treated with IL-1β or HS-5 bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) conditioned medium and analyzed by RNA sequencing and RT-QPCR. To verify genes identified by RNA sequencing, LNCaP, MDA-PCa-2b, PC3, and DU145 PCa cell lines were treated with the IL-1 family members, IL-1α or IL-1β, or exposed to HS-5 BMSC in the presence or absence of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1RA). Treated cells were analyzed by western blot and/or RT-QPCR.  Results:   Comparative analysis of sequencing data from the AR+ LNCaP PCa cell line versus the AR- PC3 PCa cell line reveals an IL-1-conferred gene suite in LNCaP cells that is constitutive in PC3 cells. Bioinformatics analysis of the IL-1 regulated gene suite revealed that inflammatory and immune response pathways are primarily elicited; likely facilitating PCa cell survival and tumorigenicity in an inflammatory tumor microenvironment.  Conclusions:   Our data supports that IL-1 reprograms AR+ PCa cells to mimic AR- PCa gene expression patterns that favor AR-targeted treatment resistance and cell survival.""","""['Shayna E Thomas-Jardin', 'Mohammed S Kanchwala', 'Joan Jacob', 'Sana Merchant', 'Rachel K Meade', 'Nagham M Gahnim', 'Afshan F Nawas', 'Chao Xing', 'Nikki A Delk']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Chronic IL-1 exposure drives LNCaP cells to evolve androgen and AR independence.', 'IL-1β induces p62/SQSTM1 and represses androgen receptor expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'RELA is sufficient to mediate interleukin-1 repression of androgen receptor expression and activity in an LNCaP disease progression model.', 'Interleukin-6: a multifunctional targetable cytokine in human prostate cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine and immune mediators in prostate cancer progression.', 'Role of Interleukin-1 family in bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Chronic IL-1 Exposed AR+ PCa Cell Lines Show Conserved Loss of IL-1 Sensitivity and Evolve Both Conserved and Unique Differential Gene Expression Profiles.', 'Response to Androgens and Androgen Receptor Antagonists in the Presence of Cytokines in Prostate Cancer.', 'Chronic IL-1 exposure drives LNCaP cells to evolve androgen and AR independence.', 'Characterization of Hormone-Dependent Pathways in Six Human Prostate-Cancer Cell Lines: A Gene-Expression Study.']"""

We present in-vitro proof-of-concept for therapeutic targeting of this switch using PARP inhibitor to specifically enhance the radiosensitivity of BCL2-overexpressing cells. Given its erroneous behavior, PARP1-EJ might allow for the accumulation of genetic alterations and tumor progression. Consistently, we report an inverse correlation between BCL2 expression and biochemical recurrence-free survival of 10.259 prostate cancer (PCa) patients who underwent primary radical-prostatectomy for localized disease. Further, we evaluated retrospectively the impact of BCL2 expression on clinical outcome of 1.426 PCa patients, who had been given salvage radiotherapy at relapse after radical prostatectomy. In line with its role in blocking NHEJ, BCL2 over-expressers showed significantly better response to salvage radiotherapy compared to low-expressers.

Patient demographics and pathologic findings were reviewed. The highest grade group per case was considered for analysis.  Results:   Follow-up was available on 133 patients who underwent MRI/US targeted biopsy and 215 patients who underwent systematic biopsy. There was no difference in prebiopsy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (10.1 ± 10.0 vs. 12.9 ± 20.5, P = 0.11) between the 2 cohorts.

In this study, Me-4FDG PET was extended to evaluate patients with high-grade astrocytic tumors. Me-4FDG PET scans were performed in four patients diagnosed with WHO Grade III or IV astrocytomas and control subjects, and compared with 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (2-FDG) PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the same subjects. Immunocytochemistry was carried out on Grade IV astrocytomas to determine the cellular location of SGLT proteins within the tumors. Me-4FDG retention was pronounced in astrocytomas in dramatic contrast to the lack of uptake into the normal brain, resulting in a high signal-to-noise ratio. Macroscopically, the distribution of Me-4FDG within the tumors overlapped with that of 2-FDG uptake and tumor definition using contrast-enhanced MRI images.

This preliminary study shows that Me-4FDG is a highly sensitive probe for visualization of high-grade astrocytomas by PET.

We investigated racial differences in PSA, PSA density (PSAD), and tumor volume among men with prostate cancer, regardless of tumor grade. These racial differences, if present, would suggest that AA men may benefit from different screening, surveillance, and treatment regiments compared to Caucasians.  Materials and methods:   We identified men from our institutional prostate cancer database that underwent radical prostatectomy between 2012 and 2015. Clinicopathologic parameters were compared by race. Multivariable linear regression was then performed to identify factors associated with PSA, PSAD, and tumor volume, adjusting for race, age, body mass index, and pathologic parameters.  Results:   A total of 255 men were included in the analysis, including 182 (71.4%) Caucasian and 73 (28.6%) AA. PSA (10.2 versus 8.1, p = 0.13) and PSAD (0.23 versus 0.22, p = 0.73) did not differ significantly between AA and Caucasian men. In contrast, tumor volume was significantly greater in AA men (13.4 versus 9.6 grams, p = 0.01). In multivariable linear regression analysis, AA race was not associated with PSA (p = 0.80) or PSAD (p = 0.41), but was significantly associated with increased tumor volume (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   AA men who underwent radical prostatectomy in this analysis had larger tumor volume than Caucasian men despite having similar PSA levels. This association suggests that prostate cancers in AA men may produce less PSA than in Caucasian men. These findings have implications for prostate cancer screening and treatment, as PSA may underestimate the presence or extent of cancer in AA men.""","""['Jay G Fuletra', 'Anastasiya Kamenko', 'Frederick Ramsey', 'Daniel D Eun', 'Adam C Reese']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['African-American Men with Gleason Score 3+3=6 Prostate Cancer Produce Less Prostate Specific Antigen than Caucasian Men: A Potential Impact on Active Surveillance.', 'Understanding PSA and its derivatives in prediction of tumor volume: Addressing health disparities in prostate cancer risk stratification.', 'Differences in the aggressiveness of prostate cancer among Korean, Caucasian, and African American men: A retrospective cohort study of radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen concentration in young men: new estimates and review of the literature.', 'Do African-American men need separate prostate cancer screening guidelines?', 'Tumor Location and a Tumor Volume over 2.8 cc Predict the Prognosis for Japanese Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Leptin modulated microRNA-628-5p targets Jagged-1 and inhibits prostate cancer hallmarks.', 'Precision intervention for prostate cancer: Re-evaluating who is at risk.', 'Calling Attention to the Role of Race-Driven Societal Determinants of Health on Aggressive Tumor Biology: A Focus on Black Americans.', 'Radical prostatectomy technique in the robotic evolution: from da Vinci standard to single port-a single surgeon pathway.']"""

Typical treatments for prostate cancer involve blocking activation of the androgen receptor by androgens. Androgen deprivation therapy can lead to the selection of cancer cells that grow and divide independently of androgen receptor activation. Prostate cancer cells that are insensitive to androgens commonly display metastatic phenotypes and reduced long-term survival of patients. In this study we provide evidence that androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells have elevated PLD activity relative to the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells. PLD activity has been linked with promoting survival in many human cancer cell lines; and consistent with the previous studies, suppression of PLD activity in the prostate cancer cells resulted in apoptotic cell death. Of significance, suppressing the elevated PLD activity in androgen resistant prostate cancer lines also blocked the ability of these cells to migrate and invade Matrigel™. Since survival signals are generally an early event in tumorigenesis, the apparent coupling of survival and metastatic phenotypes implies that metastasis is an earlier event in malignant prostate cancer than generally thought.

The prostate score assay was previously shown to be a significant independent predictor of adverse pathology findings at radical prostatectomy in men diagnosed by systematic biopsies only. Therefore, we investigated the ability of the prostate score assay to predict adverse pathology findings in the setting of magnetic resonance imaging guided prostate biopsy.  Materials and methods:   We identified men diagnosed with NCCN® (National Comprehensive Cancer Network®) very low, low or intermediate risk prostate cancer who underwent simultaneous multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging fusion targeted and systematic prostate biopsy with subsequent radical prostatectomy within 6 months. Prostate score assay testing was performed on biopsy tissue with the highest Gleason score. The primary outcome of the study was adverse pathology findings, defined as Gleason score 4 + 3 or greater disease and/or pT3+ at radical prostatectomy. Independent predictors of adverse pathology findings were determined in a multivariable model to adjust for clinical parameters.  Results:   A total of 134 men were eligible for primary analysis. On univariable analysis the UCLA score, magnetic resonance imaging, prostate score assay results and biopsy Gleason score were significant predictors of adverse pathology findings. After multivariable adjustment prostate score assay values remained a significant predictor of adverse pathology results (prostate score assay per 20 U OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.74-6.62, p <0.001). A wide and overlapping distribution of prostate score assay results was seen across PI-RADS® (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) version 2 scores.  Conclusions:   The prostate score assay result is an independent predictor of adverse pathology findings in patients who were diagnosed with very low, low or intermediate risk prostate cancer in the setting of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging fusion prostate biopsy.

In the present study, we further explored the role and the underlying mechanism of CXCL3 overexpression in the oncogenic potential of prostate cancer in an autocrine/paracrine fashion.  Methods:   CXCL3-overexpressing prostate cancer cell line PC-3 and immortalized prostate stromal cell line WPMY-1 were established by gene transfection. CCK-8, transwell assays and growth of tumor xenografts were conducted to characterize the effects of CXCL3 on PC-3 cells' proliferation and migration. Western blotting was conducted to test whether CXCL3 could affect the expression of tumorigenesis-associated genes.  Results:   The results showed that CXCL3 overexpression in PC-3 cells and the PC-3 cells treated with the supernatants of CXCL3-transfected WPMY-1 cells stimulated the proliferation and migration of PC-3 cells in vitro and in a nude mouse xenograft model. Western blotting revealed higher levels of p-ERK, Akt and Bcl-2 and lower levels of Bax in the tumor xenografts transplanted with CXCL3-transfected PC-3 cells. Moreover, the tumor xenografts derived from the PC-3 cells treated with supernatants of CXCL3-transfected WPMY-1 cells showed higher expression of ERK, Akt and Bcl-2 and lower expression of Bax.

Therefore, accurate knowledge of prostate anatomy as well as normal distribution of PSMA within the prostate gland is becoming essential. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological intraprostatic distribution of 68Ga-PSMA-11.  Methods:   We retrospectively analysed all patients who underwent a staging 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI scan between June 2016 and January 2018 for high-risk PCA, underwent radical prostatectomy in our institution, and gave written consent for further data analysis. In each patient, standardized volumes of interest (VOIs) were placed bilaterally in the central, transition and peripheral zones within the zonal anatomy according to T2 weighted sequences in the axial and coronal planes. VOIs were only placed if they were safely within healthy tissue without spillover from the PCA. SUVmax and SUVmean were determined and their differences among the regions were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test.  Results:   Of 283 consecutive patients scanned with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MR, 31 were analysed. A total of 133 VOIs were placed, 46 in the central zone, 41 in the transition zone and 46 in the peripheral zone.

Methods:   53 h of intra-fractional motion of the prostate were recorded in real-time by 4D ultrasound (4DUS) during 720 fractions in 28 patients, 14 of which whom treated with step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and 14 of whom were treated with volumetric arc therapy (VMAT).  Results:   The average VMAT fraction was recorded for 2 min 43 s and was substantially shorter than the average step-and-shoot IMRT fraction at 6 min 13 s. Average radial displacement of the prostate per fraction was substantially and significantly reduced from 1.31 ± 1.28 mm (n = 357 step-and-shoot IMRT fractions) to 0.96 ± 1.04 mm (n = 363 VMAT fractions), p = 0.00004. Radial, vertical, and longitudinal root-mean-square (r. m. s.) error per fraction was reduced from 1.55 to 1.12 mm (-28%, p < 0.0001), from 1.16 to 0.77 mm (-34%, p < 0.0001), and from 0.79 to 0.56 mm (-29%, p = 0.0002), respectively. Lateral intra-fractional motion was generally small and did not differ significantly. The prostate remained during 95% of fraction time within 4.55 mm of the isocenter in case of step-and-shoot IMRT and within 2.45 mm in case of VMAT. The variance of displacements increased linearly with time, and the rate was the same for both step-and-shoot IMRT and VMAT patients.  Conclusions:   The position of the prostate changed less during shorter fractions, limiting fraction-average and end-of-fraction variance.

However, these parameters are not completely accurate in discriminating between high- and low-risk disease, creating a need for a reliable marker to determine aggressiveness. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) appears to fulfill this need. We analyzed 79 prostate biopsies and 28 prostatectomies to assess whether PSMA expression detected by immunohistochemistry is related to GS. PSMA expression was correlated with GS in both sample types (biopsies, P < 0.0001 and prostatectomy samples, P = 0.007). We observed lower PSMA expression in Gleason pattern 3 than Gleason pattern 4, suggesting that this biomarker could be useful to distinguish between these entities (p < 0.0001). The best cut-off value of 45% immunopositivity was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. In Gleason pattern 3 vs. Gleason pattern 4 and 5, PSMA sensitivity was 84.1% (95% CI 76.5%-91.7%) and specificity was 95.2% (95% CI 90.6%-99.8%), with an area under the curve of 93.1 (95% CI 88.8-97.4).

The immunosuppressive capacity of mast cells, which promote adenocarcinoma development in the prostate, prompted our investigation on whether mast cells promote tolerance to SV40 Large-T antigen, the transforming oncogene in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. The incidence of adenocarcinoma was reduced in the offspring of a cross between TRAMP mice and mast cell-deficient KitWsh mice. TRAMP mice are tolerant to the SV40 Large T antigen, which is otherwise immunogenic in normal syngeneic B6 mice. Genetic ablation of mast cells in TRAMP mice restored their ability to mount a tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell response. In KitWsh-TRAMP mice, the restored T-cell immunity correlated with the reduced activity of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC), along with their reduced expression of Arg1, Nos2, and Stat3 Having found that CD40L-expressing mast cells can interact in vivo with CD40-expressing PMN-MDSC, we then determined that only KitWsh-TRAMP mice reconstituted with mast cells expressing CD40L could restore PMN-MDSCs suppressive functions, T-cell unresponsiveness and adenocarcinoma development. Thus, mast cells have an immunoregulatory effect on PMN-MDSCs activity through CD40L-CD40 interaction, favoring immunosuppression and tumor onset. In prostate cancer patients, in silico analyses correlated poor clinical outcomes with high expression of genes related to mast cells and PMN-MDSCs.

Here, we demonstrate that HDAC3 augments AKT phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells and its overexpression correlates with AKT phosphorylation in patient samples. HDAC3 facilitates lysine-63-chain polyubiquitination and phosphorylation of AKT, and this effect is mediated by AKT deacetylation at lysine 14 and 20 residues and HDAC3 interaction with the scaffold protein APPL1. Conditional homozygous deletion of Hdac3 suppresses prostate tumorigenesis and progression by concomitant blockade of AKT and AR signaling in the Pten knockout mouse model. Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC3 using a selective HDAC3 inhibitor RGFP966 inhibits growth of both PTEN-deficient and SPOP-mutated prostate cancer cells in culture, patient-derived organoids and xenografts in mice.

Study design:   Thirty consecutive patients who underwent PSMA PET/CT for prostate cancer were evaluated. Tracer maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) in the salivary, seromucous, and lacrimal glands were determined visually and quantitatively. Overall and intraindividual variations were reported.  Results:   All gland locations had increased tracer uptake. The mean SUVmax ± standard deviation varied: parotid 12.3 ± 3.9; submandibular 11.7 ± 3.5; sublingual 4.5 ± 1.9; soft palate 2.4 ± 0.5; pharyngeal wall 4.3 ± 1.3; nasal mucosa 3.4 ± 0.9; supraglottic larynx 2.7 ± 0.7; and lacrimal 6.2 ± 2.2.

Design, setting, and participants:   The NRG Oncology/RTOG 0126 randomized clinical trial randomized 1532 patients from 104 North American Radiation Therapy Oncology Group institutions March 2002 through August 2008. Men with stage cT1b to T2b, Gleason score 2 to 6, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 10 or greater and less than 20 or Gleason score of 7 and PSA less than 15 received 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy or intensity-modulated radiation therapy to 79.2 Gy in 44 fractions or 70.2 Gy in 39 fractions.  Main outcomes and measures:   Time to OS measured from randomization to death due to any cause.

Acute (≤90 days of treatment start) and late radiation therapy toxic effects (>90 days) were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0, and the RTOG/European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme, respectively.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 8.4 (range, 0.02-13.0) years in 1499 patients (median [range] age, 71 [33-87] years; 70% had PSA <10 ng/mL, 84% Gleason score of 7, 57% T1 disease), there was no difference in OS between the 751 men in the 79.2-Gy arm and the 748 men in the 70.2-Gy arm. The 8-year rates of OS were 76% with 79.2 Gy and 75% with 70.2 Gy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.83-1.20; P = .98). The 8-year cumulative rates of distant metastases were 4% for the 79.2-Gy arm and 6% for the 70.2-Gy arm (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42-1.01; P = .05). The ASTRO and Phoenix biochemical failure rates at 5 and 8 years were 31% and 20% with 79.2 Gy and 47% and 35% with 70.2 Gy, respectively (both P < .001; ASTRO: HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.70; Phoenix: HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44-0.65).

Fertility desire could increase HIV transmission risk if it was associated with condomless sex or lower adherence to antiretroviral therapy.  Methods:   A prospective cohort study was conducted among 255 HIV-positive female sex workers in Mombasa, Kenya. Using generalized estimating equations, fertility desire was evaluated as a risk factor for semen detection in vaginal secretions by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, a biomarker of condomless sex, detectable plasma viral load (VL), and HIV transmission potential, defined as visits with positive PSA and detectable VL.  Results:   The effect of fertility desire on PSA detection varied significantly by nonbarrier contraception use (P-interaction < 0.01). At visits when women reported not using nonbarrier contraception, fertility desire was associated with higher risk of semen detection [82/385, 21.3% vs. 158/1007, 15.7%; adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 2.23]. However, when women used nonbarrier contraception, fertility desire was associated with lower risk of PSA detection (10/77, 13.0% vs. 121/536, 22.6%; aRR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.94). Fertility desire was not associated with detectable VL (31/219, 14.2% vs. 128/776, 16.5%; aRR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.46 to 1.45) or higher absolute risk of transmission potential (10/218, 4.6% vs. 21/769, 2.7%; adjusted risk difference = 0.011, 95% CI -0.031 to 0.050).

Results:   The RS technique was able to distinguish prostate from extraprostatic tissue with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 83% and benign from malignant tissue with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 86%. In an exploratory fashion, RS differentiated benign from GG1 in 726/801 spectra (91%; sensitivity 80%, specificity 91%), from GG2 in 588/805 spectra (73%; sensitivity 76%, specificity 73%), from GG3 in 670/797 spectra (84%; sensitivity 86%, specificity 84%), from GG4 in 711/802 spectra (88%; sensitivity 77%, specificity 89%) and from GG5 in 729/818 spectra (89%; sensitivity 90%, specificity 89%).  Conclusion:   Current diagnostic approaches of PCa using needle biopsies have suboptimal cancer detection rates and a significant risk of infection. Standard non-targeted random sampling results in false-negative biopsies in 15-30% of patients, which affects clinical management. RS, a non-destructive tissue interrogation technique providing vibrational molecular information, resolved the highly complex architecture of the prostate and detect cancer with high accuracy using a fibre optic probe to interrogate radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens from 32 patients (947 spectra). This proof-of-principle paves the way for the development of in vivo tumour targeting spectroscopy tools for informed biopsy collection to address the clinical need for accurate PCa diagnosis and possibly to improve surgical resection during RP as a complement to histopathological analysis.""","""['Kelly Aubertin', 'Vincent Quoc Trinh', 'Michael Jermyn', 'Paul Baksic', 'Andrée-Anne Grosset', 'Joannie Desroches', 'Karl St-Arnaud', 'Mirela Birlea', 'Maria Claudia Vladoiu', 'Mathieu Latour', 'Roula Albadine', 'Fred Saad', 'Frédéric Leblond', 'Dominique Trudel']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Image-guided Raman spectroscopy navigation system to improve transperineal prostate cancer detection.

Moreover, we aimed to assess the expression of transcripts that are specific for cancer stem cells (AdnaTest StemCell) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CTCs (AdnaTest EMT), as well as additional genes that are known to promote prostate cancer progression.  Patients and methods:   In this prospective study, we included 81 patients who underwent treatment for prostate cancer between 07/2014 and 02/2015, including: Group A, 18 patients (22.2%) with low-risk clinically localised prostate cancer; Group B, 25 patients (30.9%) with high-risk clinically localised prostate cancer; Group C, 11 patients (13.6%) with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC); and Group D, 27 patients (33.3%) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). AdnaTest ProstateCancer and AdnaTest StemCell/EMT were performed in all cases. In addition, expression of the androgen receptor (AR), c-met, c-kit and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) in CTCs was assessed using specific polymerase chain reaction assays.  Results:   A positive AdnaTest ProstateCancer was present in three (16.7%), two (8.0%), six (54.5%) and 19 (70.5%) patients in groups A, B, C and D, respectively (P < 0.01, chi-squared test). The AdnaTest EMT and AdnaTest StemCell were positive in zero (0.0%), zero (0.0%), one (9.1%), and two (7.4%); and in five (27.8%), four (16.0%), three (27.3%), and 11 (40.7%) patients in groups A, B, C and D, respectively, with no significant differences noted between groups. CTCs expressing TYMS (44.4% and 50.0% vs 13.9%) or AR (18.2% and 25.9% vs 0.0%) were seen more commonly in patients in groups C and D vs patients with non-metastatic disease (all P < 0.05). Expression of c-kit and c-met were rare events, with only two patients positive for either marker.  Conclusions:   AdnaTest ProstateCancerDetect exhibits positive results mainly in patients with metastatic disease. Expression of AR and TYMS are frequent events in CTCs of patients with advanced disease, whereas c-met and c-kit gene expression is seen in only a small proportion of patients.

In the literature, the performance of predictive models trained to detect PCa on mpMRI has typically been reported in terms of voxel-wise measures such as sensitivity and specificity and/or area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). However, it is unclear whether models that score higher by these measures are actually superior. Here, we propose a novel method for lesion identification as well as novel measures that assess the quality of the detected lesions.  Methods:   A total of 46 axial MRI slices of interest from 34 patients and the associated histopathologic ground truths were used to develop and to characterize the proposed measures. The proposed lesion-wise score sℓ is based on the Jaccard similarity index with modifications that emphasize the overlap and colocalization of predicted lesions with ground truth lesions. Thresholding of sℓ allowed for the sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection to be assessed, while the proposed lesion-summary score sσ is a weighted average of sℓ s that provides a single summary statistic of lesion detection performance. The proposed measures were used to compare the lesion detection performance of a predictive model vs that of a radiologist on the same data set. The measures were also used to evaluate the degree to which viewing the cancer prediction improved diagnostic accuracy.  Results:   The lesion-wise score qualitatively reflected the goodness of predicted lesions over a wide range of values (sℓ = 0.1 to sℓ = 0.8) and was found to encompass a larger range of values than the Dice coefficient did over the same range of prediction qualities (0-0.9 vs 0-0.75). The lesion-summary score was shown to vary linearly with voxel-wise sensitivity and quadratically with voxel-wise specificity and correlated well with voxel-wise AUC (ρ = 0.68) and the Dice coefficient (ρ = 0.88). Radiologist performance was found to be significantly improved after viewing the model-generated cancer prediction maps as quantified by both sσ (P = 0.01) and DSC (P = 0.04), with improvements in both lesion detection sensitivity and specificity.  Conclusion:   The proposed measures allow for the assessment of lesion detection performance, which is most relevant in a clinical setting and would not be possible to do with voxel-wise measures alone.""","""['Ethan Leng', 'Benjamin Spilseth', 'Lin Zhang', 'Jin Jin', 'Joseph S Koopmeiners', 'Gregory J Metzger']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Computer aided detection in prostate cancer diagnostics: A promising alternative to biopsy?

Objective:   The present study for the first time analyzed the antioxidant and cytotoxicity of the hydroalcoholic leaves extract and fractions from Pm.  Method:   The cytotoxicity test will be evaluated by different assays (MTT and CV) against human prostate cancer (PC3) and mouse malignant melanoma (B16F10) cell lines, and the antioxidant test by DPPH method.  Results:   β-Amyrin, oleanolic acid, β-sitosterol and stigmasterol were isolated of the most active, hexane fraction. These substances were tested against the tumor cell lines: β-sitosterol and stigmasterol showed the most relevant activity to PC3 in CV assay and, oleanolic acid to B16F10 by the MTT assay. In addition, it was possible to indicate that the mode of cell death for stigmasterol, presumably is apoptosis. In terms of antioxidant activity, the hydroalcoholic leaves extract presented higher activity (EC50 133.3 µg/mL) compared to the flower (EC50 152.3 µg/mL) and fruit (EC50 207.9 µg/mL) extracts. By the HPLC-MS, it was possible to identify the presence of flavones in the leaf extract (isoschaftoside, schaftoside, isovitexin, vitexin, isoorientin, orientin).

We sought to better understand how the changing landscape influenced treatment utilization in the United States.  Methods:   We used the SEER database in this retrospective analysis of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer between 2004 and 2013. We evaluated utilization of primary treatment modalities over time with descriptive and trend analyses, and examined treatment utilization by cancer risk group and age at diagnosis.  Results:   Of 398 074 patients in the analytic data set, 38% elected radiation therapy, 38% underwent radical prostatectomy, and 24% opted for expectant management. While in 2004 radiation treatment was almost twice as common as expectant management (42% vs 23%), by 2013 approximately equal percentages of patients were treated with each of the three modalities. Expectant management use increased over time, while the proportion of patients opting for surgery decreased remarkably with increasing age at diagnosis in intermediate- and higher-risk disease. Among radiotherapy options, brachytherapy was most common among lower-risk patients in 2004 but substantially decreased over time (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Management of localized prostate cancer changed substantially over time in the United States. Utilization of expectant management has increased for men with low- and intermediate risk cancer. Among those who pursue curative therapy, younger men remain more likely to elect surgery whereas older men tend to choose radiotherapy.

After manipulating the expression of miR-206 and CXCL11 in PC-3 and DU-145 cells, the changes of cell proliferation and cell cycle were observed through cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry.

However, the long-term impact of repeat biopsies on functional outcomes in this patient population remains unelucidated. Thus, we compared functional outcomes between patients who underwent single biopsy versus repeat biopsies before radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   From 1996 to 2015, 1015 consecutive patients underwent radical prostatectomy, and subsequently had urinary continence and erectile function assessed for >2 years follow-up. One-fourth of patients (275; 27%) had ≥2 biopsies before prostatectomy. Logistic regression models tested whether repeat biopsy before prostatectomy predicted continence or erectile function recovery.  Results:   For the overall cohort, continence rates were 84%, 92%, 96%, and 98% at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Repeat biopsy before prostatectomy was associated with lower continence rate at 3 months compared to single biopsy (P = 0.03); however, no significant differences were observed at 6, 12, or 24 months. In multivariable analyses adjusting for age, body mass index and diabetes/cardiovascular disease/smoking, the association between repeat biopsy and lower likelihood of continence at 3 months remained (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.47-0.97; P = 0.03). Overall erectile function recovery rates were 16%, 33%, 51%, and 55% at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. No difference in erectile function recovery rates was seen at any time point for single biopsy versus repeat biopsy. In multivariable analyses, repeat biopsy was not predictive of erectile function recovery at any time point.  Conclusions:   Repeat biopsy before radical prostatectomy impairs early continence after surgery. However, erectile function recovery and mid-term to long-term continence are not affected.

Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of this signaling pathway has a role in prostate carcinogenesis. Our study aims to determine the prognostic significance of MAGI2 expression in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Tissue microarrays from 51 radical prostatectomy cases including benign prostatic tissue, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), and adenocarcinoma were constructed. Immunohistochemistry with double staining for MAGI2 and p63 was performed and analyzed by image analysis as percent of analyzed area (%AREA). Multivariable logistic regression was used to correlate MAGI2 expression with clinical outcomes. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with linear and logistic regression was used to correlate MAGI2 with intrapatient histology.  Results:   MAGI2 %AREA was inversely associated with progression from HGPIN to adenocarcinoma of low to high Gleason score (OR, 0.980; slope, -0.02; P = 0.005) and HGPIN to cancer of any Gleason score (OR, 0.969; P = 0.007). After adjusting for grade, stage, and margin status, MAGI2 %AREA was a significant independent predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR) (OR, 0.936; 95%CI, 0.880-0.996; P = 0.037; bootstrap P = 0.017). The addition of MAGI2 %AREA to these standard clinical parameters improved accuracy of predicting BCR by 2.9% (91.0% vs 88.1%).  Conclusions:   These results reveal that MAGI2 expression is reduced during prostate cancer progression and that retention of MAGI2 signal reduces odds of BCR. The study results further suggest a possible role of MAGI2 in prostate neoplasia. Decreased MAGI2 expression may help predict prostate cancer aggressiveness and provide new insight for treatment decisions and post-operative surveillance intervals.""","""['Stephanie N David', 'Shanna A Arnold Egloff', 'Rajen Goyal', 'Peter E Clark', 'Sharon Phillips', 'Lan L Gellert', 'Omar Hameed', 'Giovanna A Giannico']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['MAGI-2 in prostate cancer: an immunohistochemical study.', 'Role of microvessel density in predicting recurrence in pathologic Stage T3 prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Tertiary Gleason pattern 5 is a powerful predictor of biochemical relapse in patients with Gleason score 7 prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is an independent predictor of outcome after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic markers in clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Inactivation of RB1, CDKN2A, and TP53 have distinct effects on genomic stability at side-by-side comparison in karyotypically normal cells.', 'A New Story of the Three Magi: Scaffolding Proteins and lncRNA Suppressors of Cancer.', 'Genetic variants of SDCCAG8 and MAGI2 in mitosis-related pathway genes are independent predictors of cutaneous melanoma-specific survival.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced exosomal miR-27a-3p promotes immune escape in breast cancer via regulating PD-L1 expression in macrophages.', 'High tumor mutation burden is associated with DNA damage repair gene mutation in breast carcinomas.']"""

To address the lack of well-trained underrepresented minority cancer scientists in Florida, the University of Florida collaborated with Florida A&M University in 2012 to establish the Florida Prostate Cancer Research Training Opportunities for Outstanding Leaders (ReTOOL) Program. Since 2012, the ReTOOL program has expanded to (1) cover all areas of cancer disparities; (2) offer training opportunities to minority students from all historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in Florida; and (3) successfully secure both intramural and extramural federal funding to continuously provide research training opportunities for minority students in Florida. Focusing primarily on training Black students, the ReTOOL model includes culturally sensitive recruitment, mentorship, didactic curriculum, networking, and hands on experience in cancer research. This paper discusses the lessons learned from administering the ReTOOL program for 5 years, which includes having the right inputs (such as majority-minority institutions partnership, funding, faculty advisors, committed mentors, culturally competent staff, and standardized program requirements) and processes (such as pipeline approach, structured applications system, didactic curriculum, research experience, and continuous mentoring) for an effective research training program.

By far the most frequently used PSMA ligand is 68Ga-labelled PSMA-11. However, due to the availability of larger amounts of activity, 18F-labelled PSMA ligands are of major interest. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the biodistribution and performance of the novel 18F-labelled ligand PSMA-1007 at two different time points.  Methods:   This retrospective analysis included 40 consecutive patients (mean age 68.7 ± 8.1 years) referred for PSMA PET/CT. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT was performed for localization of biochemical relapse, primary staging or therapy follow-up. Circular regions of interest were placed on representative slices of the liver, spleen, kidney, abdominal aortic blood pool, bone marrow (fourth lumbar vertebral body), urinary bladder and gluteus muscle at 60 and 120 min after injection. In malignant lesions the maximum standardized uptake (SUVmax) was measured within volumes of interest at both time points. All SUVs at 60 min were compared with those at 120 min after injection.  Results:   The activity in the blood pool, urinary bladder and gluteus muscle was very low and decreased significantly over time (P < 0.001). Uptake in the liver, spleen and kidney showed a significant increase over time and uptake in the bone marrow remained stable. Overall, 135 PCa lesions were detected at 60 min and 136 lesions at 120 min after injection. The median SUVmax increased significantly (P < 0.001) from 10.98 to 15.51 between 60 and 120 min.  Conclusion:   PCa lesions show a significant increase in 18F-PSMA-1007 uptake at 120 min compared with 60 min after injection. In addition, accumulation of the tracer in the urinary bladder was very low leading to improved contrast of adjacent PCa lesions. Increasing accumulation in the liver may limit the sensitivity of the tracer in detecting liver metastases.""","""['Kambiz Rahbar', 'Ali Afshar-Oromieh', 'Martin Bögemann', 'Stefan Wagner', 'Michael Schäfers', 'Lars Stegger', 'Matthias Weckesser']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Early dynamic imaging in 68Ga- PSMA-11 PET/CT allows discrimination of urinary bladder activity and prostate cancer lesions.', 'F-18 labelled PSMA-1007: biodistribution, radiation dosimetry and histopathological validation of tumor lesions in prostate cancer patients.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen for prostate cancer theranostics: from imaging to targeted therapy.', '18F-Labeled, PSMA-Targeted Radiotracers: Leveraging the Advantages of Radiofluorination for Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging.', 'PET/CT imaging 2\xa0h after injection of 18FPSMA-1007 can lead to higher staging of prostate cancer than imaging after 1\xa0h.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a Companion Diagnostic Radiopharmaceutical, 18FPSMA-1007, in a Subcutaneous Prostate Cancer Xenograft Mouse Model.', 'PSMA PET-CT in the Diagnosis and Staging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Hybrid imaging with 68GaPSMA-11 PET-CT and PET-MRI in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Assessing the accuracy of 18FPSMA-1007 PET/CT for primary staging of lymph node metastases in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients.']"""

Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox effector factor 1 (APE1/Ref-1) is a multifunctional protein that is essential in activating oncogenic transcription factors. Because APE1/Ref-1 is expressed and elevated in prostate cancer, we sought to characterize APE1/Ref-1 expression and activity in human prostate cancer cell lines and determine the effect of selective reduction-oxidation (redox) function inhibition on prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Due to the role of oncogenic transcriptional activators NFĸB and STAT3 in survivin protein expression, and APE1/Ref-1 redox activity regulating their transcriptional activity, we assessed selective inhibition of APE1/Ref-1's redox function as a novel method to halt prostate cancer cell growth and survival. Our study demonstrates that survivin and APE1/Ref-1 are significantly higher in human prostate cancer specimens compared to noncancerous controls and that APE1/Ref-1 redox-specific inhibition with small molecule inhibitor, APX3330 and a second-generation inhibitor, APX2009, decreases prostate cancer cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest. Inhibition of APE1/Ref-1 redox function significantly reduced NFĸB transcriptional activity, survivin mRNA and survivin protein levels.

Altered expression of miR-211 has been observed in various types of human cancer; however, its expression and role in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unknown. In the present study, the expression of miR-211 in PCa cell lines and tissues was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qPCR), revealing that miR-211 was downregulated in PCa cell lines and tissues. Further analysis revealed that low miR-211 was associated with the tumor stage and Gleason score. With the assistance of miR-211 mimics and inhibitor, it was also revealed that the overexpression of miR-211 could inhibit PCa cell proliferation in vitro. Conversely, downregulated miR-211 expression promotes PCa cell proliferation. In addition, the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) was identified as a target of miR-211 in the PCa cell lines, and SPARC expression was inversely associated with miR-211. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the miR-211 expression was downregulated in PCa cell lines and tissues. Additionally, miR-211 could inhibit PCa cell proliferation partially by downregulating SPARC.

We previously showed that microRNA-221/222 is up-regulated in CRPC and plays a critical role in modulating androgen receptor function during CRPC development. With further investigation, we characterized a putative promoter region located 23.3 kb upstream of the miR-221/222 gene, and this promoter is differentially activated in CRPC LNCaP-Abl cells, leading to the up-regulation of miR-221/222. Upon promoter activation, a set of polyadenylated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MIR222HGs was transcribed from this promoter region. Over-expression of these MIR222HGs increased androgen-independent cell growth and repressed the expression of androgen receptor-regulated dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced KLK3, TMPRSS2, and FKBP5 in HSPC LNCaP cells, hallmarks of the CRPC phenotype. Clinically, increased expression of MIR222HG is associated with PCa progression to CRPC. In primary tumors, expression levels of MIR222HG and miR-221/222 inversely correlate with Gleason score and androgen receptor (AR) pathway activity. Interestingly, MIR222HG is Argonaute 2-bound and its expression is Dicer 1-dependent, suggesting its functional association with the RNA-induced silencing complex. Further studies led to the hypothesis that MIR222HG may potentially affect miR-mediated expression silencing, subsequently leading to AR reprogramming. Our study highlights an essential role of a non-coding RNA in CRPC development and that differential activation of a single promoter can up-regulate two different types of non-coding RNAs, miR-221/222 and lncRNA MIR222HG, in CRPC.

In this study, we report that loss of myristoylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2α), a scaffold protein essential for FGFR signaling, inhibits FGF/FGFR-mediated oncogenic signaling and FGF10-induced tumorigenesis. Moreover, a previously synthesized myristoyl-CoA analog, B13, which targets the activity of N-myristoyltransferases, suppressed FRS2α myristoylation and decreased the phosphorylation with mild alteration of FRS2α localization at the cell membrane. B13 inhibited oncogenic signaling induced by WT FGFRs or their drug-resistant mutants (FGFRsDRM). B13 alone or in combination with an FGFR inhibitor suppressed FGF-induced WT FGFR- or FGFRDRM-initiated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity or MAPK signaling, inducing cell cycle arrest and thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and migration in several cancer cell types.

We therefore examined cancer risk and prognosis of cancer in patients with lower limb arterial thrombosis.  Methods:   Using nationwide population-based Danish medical registries, we identified all patients diagnosed with first-time lower limb arterial thrombosis (1994-2013) and followed them until the occurrence of any subsequent cancer diagnosis, emigration, death, or November 30, 2013, whichever came first. We computed standardized incidence ratios with 95% confidence intervals as the observed number of cancers relative to the expected number based on national incidence rates by sex, age, and calendar year. To examine the prognostic impact of lower limb arterial thrombosis on all-cause mortality after cancer, we constructed a matched comparison cohort of patients who had cancer without lower limb arterial thrombosis.  Results:   Among 6600 patients with lower limb arterial thrombosis, we observed 772 subsequent cancers. The risk of any cancer was 2.5% after 6 months of follow-up, increasing to 17.9% after 20 years. During the first 6 months of follow-up, the standardized incidence ratio of any cancer was 3.28 (95% confidence interval, 2.79-3.82). The standardized incidence ratio remained elevated during 7 to 12 months (1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.83) and beyond 12 months (1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.24). The strongest associations were found for lung cancer and other smoking-related cancers. Lower limb arterial thrombosis also was associated with increased all-cause mortality after colon, lung, urinary bladder, and breast cancer, but not after prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Lower limb arterial thrombosis was a marker of occult cancer, especially lung cancer, and was an adverse prognostic factor for mortality in common cancers.""","""['Jens Sundbøll', 'Katalin Veres', 'Erzsébet Horváth-Puhó', 'Kasper Adelborg', 'Henrik Toft Sørensen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Circulation""","""['Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and subsequent cancer risk: a nationwide population-based cohort study.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Thrombotic diseases in young women and the influence of oral contraceptives.', 'Arterial Thrombosis in Cancer: Spotlight on the Neglected Vessels.', 'Anaplastic thyroid tumor as an embolic source of metastasis.', 'Atrial Cardiomyopathy Predicts Worse Outcome in Patients With Lung Cancer.', 'Circulating D-Dimers Increase the Risk of Mortality and Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Lung Cancer: A Systematic Analysis Combined With External Validation.', 'Cancer-Associated Atherothrombosis: The Challenge.', 'Predictors for thromboembolism in patients with cholangiocarcinoma.']"""

This study aims to investigate the performance of the novel BioXmark® liquid marker for state-of-the-art multimodal imaging used in prostate cancer (PCa) radiotherapy, encompassing kV CT/CBCT, multiparametric MRI, and kV x-ray imaging. In addition, automatic detection of the liquid markers in x-ray imaging for prostate motion monitoring during treatment was investigated.  Methods:   A total of eight BioXmark® liquid markers with varying volumes (range 5-300 μL) were casted on a square grid into a gelatin phantom insert. A cylindrical gold marker (QLRAD, length = 7 mm, Ø = 1 mm) was inserted for reference. Liquid marker visibility and streaking artifacts in CT/CBCT imaging were evaluated by placing the gelatin phantom into a CIRS anthropomorphic phantom. Relevant MRI characteristics such as the T2 and T1 relaxation times, the ADC value, and the relative proton density (ρH) were quantified by placing the gelatin phantom insert next to a T1MES mapping phantom and a water-filled syringe for reference. Ex vivo multiparametric MRI images were acquired by placing the gelatin phantom next to a resected prostate specimen. Anterior-posterior x-ray projection images were obtained by placing the gelatin phantom insert on top of an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom with internal pelvic bony structures and were acquired for five positions relative to the bony anatomy and 24 clinically relevant x-ray exposure settings. To quantify individual automatic marker detection, single markers were artificially isolated in the x-ray images using postprocessing.  Results:   Markers of all sizes were clearly visible on CT and CBCT images with only the largest marker volumes (100-300 μL) displaying artifacts similar in size to the gold fiducial marker. Artifact size increased with increasing liquid marker volume. Liquid markers displayed good contrast in ex vivo T1-weighted and ρH-weighted images. The markers were not visible in the ex vivo T2-weighted image. The liquid markers induced a chemical shift artifact in the obtained ADC-map. Automated detection in x-ray imaging was feasible with high detection success (four of five positions) for marker volumes in the range of 25-200 μL. None of the liquid markers were detected successfully when superimposed on a bony edge, independent of their size.  Conclusions:   This study is the first to show the compatibility of BioXmark® liquid markers with multimodal image-guided radiotherapy for PCa. Compared to a solid gold marker, they had favorable results in both visibility and induced imaging artifacts. Liquid marker visibility in MRI imaging of the prostate does not solely depend on the low ρH value (not visible on T2-weighted image) but is also influenced by its relaxation times. Automated marker detection in x-ray images was feasible but better adapted marker detection algorithms are necessary for marker localization in the presence of bony edges. Hence, the liquid marker provides a minimally invasive (fine needles) and highly applicable alternative to current solid gold markers for multimodal image-guided prostate radiotherapy treatments.""","""['Robin De Roover', 'Wouter Crijns', 'Kenneth Poels', 'Ronald Peeters', 'Cédric Draulans', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Tom Depuydt']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Quantification of MRI visibility and artifacts at 3T of liquid fiducial marker in a pancreas tissue-mimicking phantom.', 'Visibility and artifacts of gold fiducial markers used for image guided radiation therapy of pancreatic cancer on MRI.', 'Fiducial markers visibility and artefacts in prostate cancer radiotherapy multi-modality imaging.', 'Minimizing magnetic resonance image geometric distortion at 7 Tesla for frameless presurgical planning using skin-adhered fiducials.', 'Image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer; how, when and why?.', 'A liquid immunogenic fiducial eluter for image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Long-Term In Vitro Assessment of Biodegradable Radiopaque Composites for Fiducial Marker Fabrication.', 'BioXmark® liquid fiducials to enable radiotherapy tumor boosting in rectal cancer, a feasibility trial.', 'Evaluation of computed tomography settings in the context of visualization and discrimination of low dose injections of a novel liquid soft tissue fiducial marker in head and neck imaging.', 'Evaluation of a Novel Liquid Fiducial Marker, BioXmark®, for Small Animal Image-Guided Radiotherapy Applications.']"""

Despite these advances, manufacturers have been slow to develop radiofrequency (RF) coils that closely follow the contour of a RT patient undergoing MR imaging. Instead, relatively large form surface coil arrays have been adapted from diagnostic imaging. These arrays can be challenging to place on, and in general do not conform to the patient's body habitus, resulting in sub optimal image quality. The purpose of this study is to report on the characterization of a new flexible and highly decoupled RF coil for use in MR imaging of RT patients. Coil performance was evaluated by performing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise correlation measurements using two coil (SNR) and four coil (noise correlation) element combinations as a function of coil overlap distance and comparing these values to those obtained using conventional coil elements. In vivo testing was performed in both normal volunteers and patients using a four and 16 element RF coil. Phantom experiments demonstrate the highly decoupled nature of the new coil elements when compared to conventional RF coils, while in vivo testing demonstrate that these coils can be integrated into extremely flexible and form fitting substrates that follow the exact contour of the patient.

While effective, many men were reluctant to get treatment with docetaxel because of the perceived toxicity, thereby further limiting the benefit of the one available and effective therapy. Remarkably, within the last 8 years, the field has seen a multitude of therapies that demonstrate an ability to extend survival for men with prostate cancer. Abiraterone and enzalutamide demonstrated the importance of the androgen axis in propelling prostate cancer growth. Sipuleucel-T was immunotherapy's entry into the evolving prostate cancer armamentarium, as the therapeutic cancer vaccine established an ability to extend survival despite an apparent lack of short-term effect on progression-free survival and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Radium-223 built on the palliative success of previous radiopharmaceuticals, but this alpha-emitting agent importantly had limited hematologic-related toxicity and was associated with a survival advantage, unlike its in-class predecessors.

Previously, we proposed C-terminal binding protein 1 (CTBP1), a transcriptional co-repressor, as a molecular link between these two conditions. Notably, CTBP1 depletion decreased PCa growth in MeS mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms that explain the link between MeS and PCa mediated by CTBP1. We found that CTBP1 repressed chloride channel accessory 2 (CLCA2) expression in prostate xenografts developed in MeS animals. CTBP1 bound to CLCA2 promoter and repressed its transcription and promoter activity in PCa cell lines. Furthermore, we found that CTBP1 formed a repressor complex with ZEB1, EP300 and HDACs that modulates the CLCA2 promoter activity. CLCA2 promoted PCa cell adhesion inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activating CTNNB1 together with epithelial marker (CDH1) induction, and mesenchymal markers (SNAI2 and TWIST1) repression. Moreover, CLCA2 depletion in PCa cells injected subcutaneously in MeS mice increased the circulating tumor cells foci compared to control. A microRNA (miRNA) expression microarray from PCa xenografts developed in MeS mice, showed 21 miRNAs modulated by CTBP1 involved in angiogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, focal adhesion and adherents junctions, among others. We found that miR-196b-5p directly targets CLCA2 by cloning CLCA2 3'UTR and performing reporter assays.

We identified SELENBP1 to be down-regulated in cutaneous melanoma, a malignant cancer of pigment-producing melanocytes in the skin, which leads to the assumption that SELENBP1 also functions as tumor suppressor in the skin, as shown by others e.g. for prostate or lung carcinoma. However, in vitro analyses indicate that SELENBP1 re-expression in human melanoma cell lines has no impact on cell proliferation, migration or tube formation of the tumor cells themselves when compared to control-transfected cells. Interestingly, supernatant taken from melanoma cell lines transfected with a SELENBP1 re-expression plasmid led to suppression of vessel formation of HMEC cells. Furthermore, SELENBP1 re-expression alters the sensitivity of melanoma cells for Vemurafenib treatment.

The levels of the three family members of miR-320 were directly correlated within each group (P < 0.001), but they differed significantly among the three groups (P < 0.001).

This involves the discovery process from assay development, image analysis, and data mining to the final interpretation and validation of the findings. Importantly, this process is not linear but allows backward steps and optimization loops over multiple sub-processes. We provide a detailed description of the Tissue Phenomics methodology while exemplifying each step on the application of prostate cancer recurrence prediction. In particular, we automatically identified tissue-based biomarkers having significant prognostic value for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients (Gleason scores 6-7b) after radical prostatectomy. We found that promising phenes were related to CD8(+) and CD68(+) cells in the microenvironment of cancerous glands in combination with the local micro-vascularization. Recurrence prediction based on the selected phenes yielded accuracies up to 83% thereby clearly outperforming prediction based on the Gleason score. Moreover, we compared different machine learning algorithms to combine the most relevant phenes resulting in increased accuracies of 88% for tumor progression prediction.

Here, we examine whether the acetyl CoA-CaMKII pathway, first described in frog oocytes, promotes prostate cancer tumorigenesis. In human prostate cancer specimens, metastatic prostate cancer expressed higher levels of active CaMKII compared with localized prostate cancer. Correspondingly, basal CaMKII activity was significantly higher in the more tumorigenic PC3 and PC3-mm2 cells relative to the less tumorigenic LNCaP and C4-2B4 cells. Deletion of CaMKII by CRISPR/Cas9 in PC3-mm2 cells abrogated cell survival under low-serum conditions, anchorage-independent growth and cell migration; overexpression of constitutively active CaMKII in C4-2B4 cells promoted these phenotypes. In an animal model of prostate cancer metastasis, genetic ablation of CaMKII reduced PC3-mm2 cell metastasis from the prostate to the lymph nodes. Knockdown of the acetyl-CoA transporter carnitine acetyltransferase abolished CaMKII activation, providing evidence that acetyl-CoA generated from organelles is a major activator of CaMKII. Genetic deletion of the β-oxidation rate-limiting enzyme ACOX family proteins decreased CaMKII activation, whereas overexpression of ACOXI increased CaMKII activation. Overall, our studies identify active CaMKII as a novel connection between organelle β-oxidation and acetyl-CoA transport with cell survival, migration, and prostate cancer metastasis.Significance: This study identifies a cell metabolic pathway that promotes prostate cancer metastasis and suggests prostate cancer may be susceptible to β-oxidation inhibitors.

We sought to determine whether the duration of induction androgen deprivation therapy would influence the duration of the off treatment interval and the recovery of serum testosterone.  Materials and methods:   This was a prospective, randomized, open label study. Men with biochemical recurrence after local therapy for prostate cancer and a negative bone scan were randomized to 4 and 10 months of monthly degarelix. The first dose was 240 mg and subsequent doses were 80 mg per month. Quality of life was evaluated by the I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), the PAS-SFI (Problem Assessment Scale of the Sexual Function Index) and the FACT-P (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate).  Results:   A total of 90 patients were randomized, including 43 to 4 months and 47 to 10 months of treatment. There was no difference in any relevant baseline laboratory parameter, including prostate specific antigen and testosterone. There was no difference between the 2 treatment groups in time off treatment (HR 1.51, 95% CI 0.60-3.84, p = 0.38). Actuarial median time to testosterone recovery to 8.0 nmol/l or greater was 8.05 months (95% CI 4.34-39.89) in the 10-month treatment arm and 6.24 months (95% CI 5.45-15.90) in the 4-month treatment arm. The log rank test showed no statistical significance between the 2 treatment groups in time to testosterone recovery (p = 0.8392). There was no difference in the testosterone recovery rate between the 2 arms. Men younger than 65 years had a considerably shorter interval off treatment and time to testosterone recovery.

Patients and methods:   Chemotherapy naive mCRPC patients received docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously every 21 days and pasireotide intramuscularly every 28 days at escalating dose levels of 40, 60, and 80 mg. Maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) were assessed.  Results:   Eighteen patients were enrolled with a median age of 65 (range, 49-75) years, and pretherapy prostate-specific antigen of 259.9 ng/mL. The dose-limiting toxicities were Grade 4 hyperglycemia unresponsive to therapy and Grade 4 neutropenia lasting for > 7 days in 1 patient each occurring at the 80-mg dose level of pasireotide. The RP2D was determined at 60 mg every 28 days. Four patients at the 60 mg dose had Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia, which responded adequately to therapy. Median time to progression and survival were 7.2 and 18.3 months, respectively. Three of 6 patients with circulating tumor cells ≥5 converted to circulating tumor cells < 5 post therapy. The insulin like growth factor-1 levels revealed a median 51% decrease after therapy. The neuron-specific enolase and chromogranin did not show any marked change.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the risk of breast cancer (BC) in men with PC as their first cancer diagnosis was influenced by PRT.  Methods and materials:   From the Norwegian Cancer Registry, we collected data from all patients with PC as their first cancer diagnosis from 1997 to 2014. We registered all RT given to the patients in the same period and the occurrence of BC diagnosed ≥3 months after the PC diagnosis. The histopathologic diagnoses of all BC cases were collected. Subdistribution hazard ratios for the risk of BC in the PRT and non-PRT groups were estimated. A standardized incidence ratio for BC was calculated by comparing our cohort to the standard male population.  Results:   We analyzed 59,169 patients with PC, of whom 7864 (13.3%) had received PRT. The median follow-up time was 4 years. Of the 12 men with a diagnosis of BC, 3 had received PRT, and 2 of the 3 were phyllodes tumors. The risk of BC was not significantly different statistically for the patients given PRT compared with the non-PRT group (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 0.41-5.62, adjusted for age and time of diagnosis). The standardized incidence ratio was 0.996 (95% confidence interval 0.57-1.75).  Conclusions:   In this registry-based study, we did not find an increased risk of BC in PC patients who received PRT. The number of BC cases in our study was low, and the risk of secondary BC after PRT seems to be negligible. The incidence of BC could, however, increase with additional follow-up.

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed and module analysis was performed. The expression of DEGs and pathway related genes were evaluated by PCR analysis and the migra- tion ability of prostate tumor cells was observed after FABP4-siRNA blocking. Upregulated FABP4 and GK were signifi- cantly enriched in the PPAR signaling pathway, whereas downregulated IGFBP3 and THBS1 were involved in p53 signaling pathway. Among the identified DEGs, 4 downregulated genes (IGFBP3, NPP4B, THBS1, and PCDH1) and 2 upregulated genes (GJA1 and TUSC3) were TAGs. The module was associated with focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, p53 signaling, and gap junction pathways with the hub node GJA1. After FABP4 silencing by siRNAs in LNcap and metastatic DU-145 cells, the numbers of migrated cells were all significantly declined. The expressions of IGFBP3, TP53 and PPAR were significantly lower in DU-145 cells than in LNcap cells.

The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) showed that seven years of finasteride reduced prostate cancer (PC) risk by 25% in men age 55 years or older. However, it was unclear whether the observed reduction in PC for finasteride participants would be maintained after finasteride discontinuation.  Methods:   We examined PC diagnoses identified by PCPT study records and Medicare claims (finasteride = 9423, placebo = 9457). A Medicare-defined PC diagnosis algorithm was defined using diagnosis and procedure codes. Multivariable Cox regression was used to examine time to PC within prespecified follow-up windows (<6.5, 6.5-7.5, and >7.5 years) using time-dependent covariates interacting with intervention assignment to account for the PCPT protocol-specified end-of-study biopsy at seven years. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Median follow-up using the linked database was 16 years. Overall, finasteride arm participants had a 21.1% decrease in the hazard ratio of PC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74 to 0.84, P < .001). The beneficial effect of finasteride in reducing the hazard ratio of PC was most pronounced in the first 7.5 years (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.66 to 0.77, P < .001), consistent with the original study findings; after 7.5 years, there was no increased risk of PC for finasteride arm participants (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.96 to 1.26, P = .18).  Conclusions:   Finasteride provides a substantial reduction in PC through 16 years of follow-up. There was no strong evidence that the benefit of finasteride diminished after the end-of-study follow-up. Utilizing Medicare claims to augment PCPT follow-up illustrates how the novel use of secondary data sources can enhance the ability to detect long-term outcomes from prospective studies.""","""['Joseph M Unger', 'Dawn L Hershman', 'Cathee Till', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'William E Barlow', 'Scott D Ramsey', 'Phyllis J Goodman', 'Ian M Thompson Jr']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Re: Using Medicare Claims to Examine Long-Term Prostate Cancer Risk of Finasteride in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'Long-term Consequences of Finasteride vs Placebo in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'Risk of Prostate Cancer in Men Treated With 5α-Reductase Inhibitors-A Large Population-Based Prospective Study.', 'Detection bias due to the effect of finasteride on prostate volume: a modeling approach for analysis of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial.', 'Therapeutic hotline.

To investigate pharmacokinetic variability in abiraterone acetate metabolism we developed highly sensitive liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) assays for the simultaneous quantitation of abiraterone and D4A in human plasma using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. This study demonstrates the quantitative performance of HRMS and compares the conventional Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM) mode of quantitation with the unconventional Full scan MS mode conducted at high resolution (>70,000 resolution). The use of HRMS for quantitation of abiraterone and D4A yielded assays that were linear over a broad concentration range (0.074-509.6 ng/mL for abiraterone; 0.075-59.93 ng/mL for D4A) in both Full scan MS and PRM modes. The assay precision for abiraterone and D4A was below 5% in PRM mode and 7% in Full scan MS mode. Accuracies fell within 98-107% for abiraterone and 104-112% for D4A in PRM mode, and 96-116% for abiraterone and 96-105% for D4A in Full scan MS mode, each meeting the acceptance criteria of FDA approved guidelines for bioanalytical methods The PRM analysis of abiraterone and D4A provided high specificity and reduced background interference, however the Full scan MS detection at a resolution of 70,000 was advantageous in that it required minimal optimization, was simple to implement, yielded comparable quantitative characteristics to PRM and the data is useful for re-analysis.

Patients and methods:   From 2015 onwards, we consecutively enrolled, at a single institution in Italy, men undergoing 12-core transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate needle biopsy. Indication for prostate biopsy was a PSA level of ≥4 ng/mL. Demographic, clinical, and histopathological data were collected. The PSA level was tested at enrolment (PSA1 ) and 4 weeks later on the day before biopsy (PSA2 ). Variations in PSA level were defined as: stable PSA2 within a 10% variation, stable PSA2 within a 20% variation, PSA2 decreased by ≥10%, PSA2 decreased by ≥20%, PSA2 increased by ≥10%, PSA2 increased by ≥20%, and PSA2 <4 ng/mL. Percentages and multinomial logistic regression were used to analyse biopsy outcomes. High-grade cancer was defined as Grade group ≥3.  Results:   Overall, 331 patients were enrolled. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 153/331 (46%) patients and of them 80/153 (52%) had high-grade disease.

Patients and methods:   This is a substudy of the trial investigating the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in prostate cancer diagnosis (Improved Prostate Cancer Diagnosis - Combination of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsies and Biomarkers Multi-institutional Study [multi-IMPROD], NCT02241122). In all, 359 patients from four study centres were recruited to this prospective study. After having signed the informed consent form, these men with suspicion of prostate cancer completed a detailed questionnaire on their medical, smoking, and travelling history, as well as their recent use of antibiotics. After the bi-parametric MRI scan, TRUS-Bx was taken and a rectal swab sample was collected and cultured for determining the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of E. coli strains. The potential risk factors for having FQ-R or third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GC-R) E. coli strains were analysed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Results:   The percentage of FQ-R and 3GC-R E. coli strains amongst the study population was 13% and 8%, respectively. Amongst patients having E. coli strains, the rate of FQ-R and 3GC-R strains was 14% and 8%, respectively. Of the 3GC-R E. coli strains, 62% proved to be ESBL-producers and 88% were also FQ-R. In multivariate analysis, international travel during the preceding year significantly increased the risk of having a FQ-R E. coli strain (odds ratio [OR] 3.592, P = 0.001) and, unexpectedly, use of antibiotics during the previous year significantly decreased this risk (OR 0.442, P = 0.035). No significant risk factors for having 3GC-R E. coli were identified.  Conclusion:   The occurrence of intestinal FQ-R and/or 3GC-R (potentially ESBL-producing) E. coli strains in men undergoing TRUS-Bx in Finland is notable.

Malignant transformation is exceptionally rare, with only a few cases reported. We report a case of a malignant cutaneous mixed tumor in an 86-year-old white man who presented with a pink indurated plaque on his left scapula. He had a history of nonmelanoma skin cancers, a stage IB malignant melanoma of a lower extremity and Gleason 4 + 3 prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy, external beam irradiation, and bicalutamide. A shave biopsy was performed and histologic examination revealed infiltrative single-unit atypical cells and small ducts in a superficially transected sclerotic dermis suggestive of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. No epidermal connection was identified. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the tumor was positive for CK7, CAM5.2, and mCEA and negative for CK20, epithelial membrane antigen, P63, prostate-specific antigen, prostatic specific acid phosphatase, and alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase. A metastasis of the breast or upper digestive tract was favored, although a primary eccrine carcinoma was also considered. Imaging was performed and no other masses were identified. A slow Mohs excision was performed with negative margins. Microscopic examination revealed a biphasic neoplasm comprised of infiltrative epithelial strands and tubules consistent with an eccrine carcinoma in a hyalinized and chondromyxoid stroma within the dermis, arising from a well-circumscribed chondroid syringoma located in the deep dermis and subcutis. Areas of clear cell change, intracytoplasmic vacuolization, and mucin pools were noted. Multiple foci of perineural invasion were identified. Additional immunohistochemical studies revealed that the tumor was positive for S100 and negative for CK5/6, calponin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, GATA3, GCDFP-15, and mammoglobin. Based on the morphologic features and immunoprofile, this was diagnosed as a malignant cutaneous mixed tumor. This case highlights the importance of obtaining adequate tissue for histologic evaluation, as they can be confused with other skin neoplasms because of their clinically ambiguous presentations. Although rare, an accurate diagnosis is important given that long-term follow-up is recommended because of the risk of local recurrence and both lymph node and distant metastases.""","""['Karan Lal', 'Travis J Morrell', 'Michael Cunningham', 'Patrick OʼDonnell', 'Nikki A Levin', 'Kristine M Cornejo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Dermatopathol""","""['Local recurrence of cutaneous mixed tumor (chondroid syringoma) as malignant mixed tumor of the thumb 20\u2009years after initial diagnosis.', 'Cutaneous chondroid syringoma.', 'Cutaneous benign mixed tumor (chondroid syringoma) of the eyelid: clinical presentation and management.', 'Recurrent malignant chondroid syringoma of the foot: a case report and review of the literature.', 'Benign chondroid syringoma (mixed tumor of skin) on the flank with satellites: case report and literature review.', 'Malignant chondroid syringoma: A systematic review.', 'A Rare Forehead Mass: The Chondroid Syringoma.', 'Malignant Chondroid Syringoma: A Report of Two Cases with a Sarcomatous Mesenchymal Component.', 'Fusion of the Genes PHF1 and TFE3 in Malignant Chondroid Syringoma.']"""

From our data, we found for the first time that CFF-1 obviously arrested cell cycle in G1 phase, decreased cell viability and then increased nuclear rupture in a dose-dependent manner and finally resulted in apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. In molecular level, our data showed that CFF-1 induced inhibition of EGFR auto-phosphorylation and inactivation of EGFR. Disruption of EGFR activity in turn suppressed downstream PI3K/AKT and Raf/Erk signal pathways, resulted in the decrease of p-FOXO1 (Ser256) and regulated the expression of apoptosis-related and cycle-related genes. Moreover, CFF-1 markedly induced cell autophagy through inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and then up-regulating Beclin-1 and LC-3II and down-regulating phosphorylation of p70S6K.

In regards to the effect on apoptosis, flow cytometric analysis and DNA Ladder TUNEL assay were utilized. The results showed that AQP3 redistribution in PC‑3 cells significantly inhibited the proliferation of cells and enhanced cell apoptosis compared with these parameters in the control. Wound healing assay and Matrigel assays determined that knockout of RalA inhibited the motility and invasion capability of PC‑3 cells.

Materials and methods:   Patients with prostate cancer were treated by opposed lateral proton beams based on a passive scattering method using an in-room CT image-guided system. The system employs a single couch for both CT scanning and beam delivery. The patient was positioned by matching the boundary between the prostate and the rectum's anterior region identified in the CT images to the corresponding boundary in the simulator images after bone matching. We acquired orthogonal kV x-ray images after couch movement and confirmed the body position by referring to the bony structure prior to treatment. In offline analyses, we contoured the targeted anatomical structures on 375 sets of daily in-room CT images for 10 patients. The uncertainty of the image-matching procedure was evaluated using the prostate contours and actual couch corrections. We also performed dose calculations using the same set of CT images, and evaluated daily change of dose-volume histograms (DVHs) to compare the effectiveness of the treatment using prostate matching to the bone-matching procedure.  Results:   The isocenter shifts by prostate matching after bone matching were 0.5 ± 1.8 and -0.8 ± 2.6 mm along the superior-inferior (SI) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions, respectively. The body movement errors (σ) after couch movement were 0.7, 0.5, and 0.3 mm along the lateral, SI and AP direction, respectively, for 30 patients. The estimated errors (σ) in the prostate matching were 1.0 and 1.3 mm, and, in conjunction with the movement errors, the total positioning uncertainty was estimated to be 1.0 and 1.4 mm along the SI and AP directions, respectively. Daily DVH analyses showed that in the prostate matching, 98.7% and 86.1% of the total 375 irradiations maintained a dose condition of V95% > 95% for the prostate and a dose constraint of V77% < 18% for the rectum, whereas 90.4% and 66.1% of the total irradiations did so when bone matching was used. The dose constraint of the rectum and dose coverage of the prostate were better maintained by prostate matching than bone matching (P < 0.001). The daily variation in the dose to the seminal vesicles (SVs) was large, and only 40% of the total irradiations maintained the initial planned values of V95% for high-risk treatment. Nevertheless, the deviations from the original value were -4 ± 7% and -5 ± 11% in the prostate and bone matching, respectively, and a better dose coverage of the SV was achieved by the prostate matching.  Conclusion:   The correction of repositioning along the AP and SI direction from conventional bone matching in CT image-guided proton therapy was found to be effective to maintain the dose constraint of the rectum and the dose coverage of the prostate. This work indicated that prostate cancer treatment by prostate matching using CT image guidance may be effective to reduce the rectal complications and achieve better tumor control of the prostate. However, an adaptive approach is desirable to maintain better dose coverage of the SVs.""","""['Yoshikazu Maeda', 'Yoshitaka Sato', 'Hiroki Minami', 'Yutaka Yasukawa', 'Kazutaka Yamamoto', 'Hiroyasu Tamamura', 'Satoshi Shibata', 'Sayuri Bou', 'Makoto Sasaki', 'Yuji Tameshige', 'Kyo Kume', 'Hiroshi Ooto', 'Shigeru Kasahara', 'Yasuhiro Shimizu', 'Yusuke Saga', 'Akira Omoya', 'Makoto Saitou']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Effects of organ motion on proton prostate treatments, as determined from analysis of daily CT imaging for patient positioning.', 'Stability of daily rectal movement and effectiveness of replanning protocols for sparing rectal doses based on the daily CT images during proton treatment for prostate cancer.', 'An automatic CT-guided adaptive radiation therapy technique by online modification of multileaf collimator leaf positions for prostate cancer.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer; how, when and why?.', 'A systematic review of volumetric image guidance in proton therapy.', 'Optimizing 3DCT image registration for interfractional changes in carbon-ion prostate radiotherapy.', 'Proton Therapy for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck: Early Clinical Experience and Current Challenges.', 'Dosimetric advantages of daily adaptive strategy in IMPT for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric Uncertainties in Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion Simultaneous Boost Using Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy.']"""

Methods:   This was a pilot prospective, single-site, before-and-after clinical trial. The control arm (n = 51) received routine care. The intervention arm (n = 52) received multimodal HBB education which included a healthy bones prescription (BoneRx), focused face-to-face education with an oncology nurse or physician, and customized educational materials. The primary endpoints were feasibility of study methods and self-reported adherence to HBBs (vitamin D intake ≥ 1000 IU/day, calcium intake 1000-1500 mg/day, and exercise ≥ 150 min/week) at 3-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints included receipt of bone mineral density (BMD) testing.  Results:   Patients were satisfied with the study intervention, found educational materials easy to understand, and felt that it increased their knowledge about osteoporosis. Although the intervention appeared to be associated with trends toward improved levels of vitamin D intake (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-4.5), calcium intake (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.63-3.4), and exercise (OR 1.7, 0.75-3.9) as compared to the control arm, none of these were statistically significant. Patients who received the study intervention were more likely to receive BMD testing (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3-8.8).  Conclusions:   Although a brief, tailored educational intervention was feasible to implement and improve BMD test utilization, it did not increase HBB participation.

Besides its role in energy homeostasis, AMPK blocks cell cycle, regulates autophagy and suppresses the anabolic processes required for rapid cell growth. AMPK is especially relevant in prostate cancer in which activation of lipogenic pathways correlate with tumor progression and aggressiveness. This study reports the discovery of a new series of 2-oxindole derivatives whose AMPK modulatory ability, as well as the antitumoral profile in prostate cancer cells, was evaluated. One of the assayed compounds, compound 8c, notably activated AMPK in cultured PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Likewise, compound 8c caused PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP cells viability inhibition. Selective knocking down of α1 or α2 isoforms as well as in vitro assays using human recombinant α1β1γ1 or α2β1γ1 AMPK isoforms revealed that compound 8c exhibit preference for AMPKα1. Consistent with efficacy at the cellular level, compound 8c was potent in suppressing the growth of PC-3 xenograft tumors.

It is unknown whether this pattern has changed recently considering increased emphasis on shared decision making in prostate cancer screening recommendations. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine recent changes in shared decision making.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study among men aged 50 years and older in the United States using 2010 and 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data (n = 9,598). Changes in receipt of shared decision making were expressed as adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Analyses were stratified on PSA testing (recent [in the past year] or no testing). Elements of shared decision making assessed included the patient being informed about the advantages only, advantages and disadvantages, and full shared decision making (advantages, disadvantages, and uncertainties).  Results:   Among men with recent PSA testing, 58.5% and 62.6% reported having received ≥1 element of shared decision making in 2010 and 2015, respectively (P = .054, aPR = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98-1.11). Between 2010 and 2015, being told only about the advantages of PSA testing significantly declined (aPR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.96) and full shared decision making prevalence significantly increased (aPR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.28-1.79) in recently tested men. Among men without prior PSA testing, 10% reported ≥1 element of shared decision making, which did not change with time.  Conclusion:   Between 2010 and 2015, there was no increase in shared decision making among men with recent PSA testing though there was a shift away from only being told about the advantages of PSA testing towards full shared decision making.

Design:   This is a secondary analysis of data from a qualitative interview study including narrative interviews and maximum variation sampling. A thematic analysis was conducted, followed by an in-depth analysis based on the principles of grounded theory.  Setting:   Interviewees were sought across Germany through self-help organisations, primary care clinics, rehabilitation facilities, physicians and other healthcare professionals to develop cancer modules for the website krankheitserfahrungen.de (illness experiences.de).  Participants:   Women with a diagnosis of breast cancer, individuals with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer and men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Results:   The meaning and role of information in the illness experiences were clearly associated with gaining control in a seemingly uncontrollable situation in which others -people, the disease- take over. Four categories characterise the ways in which information helped interviewees to regain a sense of control following a diagnosis of cancer: 'becoming confident in one's treatment decision', 'taking responsibility for one's situation', 'understanding the consequences of the disease and treatment for one's life', and 'dealing with fear'. There was, however, always a fine line between information seeking and becoming overwhelmed by information.  Conclusions:   Information needs to be understood as a management tool for handling the disease and its (potential) consequences. Patients' unmet needs for information might not be easily solved by a simple increase in the amount of information because emotional support and respect for patient autonomy might also play a role. The evaluation of one's own information behaviour and the information received is closely linked to how the illness unfolds.

Recently, we have described αvβ6, a surface receptor of the integrin family as a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer; this epithelial-specific molecule is an ideal target since, unlike other integrins, it is found in different types of cancer but not in normal tissues. We describe a novel αvβ6-mediated signaling pathway that has profound effects on the microenvironment. We show that αvβ6 is transferred from cancer cells to monocytes, including β6-null monocytes, by exosomes and that monocytes from prostate cancer patients, but not from healthy volunteers, express αvβ6. Cancer cell exosomes, purified via density gradients, promote M2 polarization, whereas αvβ6 down-regulation in exosomes inhibits M2 polarization in recipient monocytes. Also, as evaluated by our proteomic analysis, αvβ6 down-regulation causes a significant increase in donor cancer cells, and their exosomes, of two molecules that have a tumor suppressive role, STAT1 and MX1/2. Finally, using the Ptenpc-/- prostate cancer mouse model, which carries a prostate epithelial-specific Pten deletion, we demonstrate that αvβ6 inhibition in vivo causes up-regulation of STAT1 in cancer cells.

Material and methods:   Data from five institutions were used. Rectal dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for 989 patients treated with 3DCRT or IMRT to 70-86.4 Gy@1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction were obtained, and corrected for fractionation effects (α/β = 3 Gy). Cohorts with best-fit Lyman-Kutcher-Burman volume-effect parameter a were pooled after calibration adjustments of the available LRB definitions. In the pooled cohort, dose-response modeling (incorporating rectal dose and geometry, and patient characteristics) was conducted on a training cohort (70%) followed by final testing on the remaining 30%. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to build models with bootstrap stability.  Results:   Two cohorts with low bleeding rates (2%) were judged to be inconsistent with the remaining data, and were excluded. In the remaining pooled cohorts (n = 690; LRB rate = 12%), an optimal model was generated for 3DCRT using the minimum rectal dose and the absolute rectal volume receiving less than 55 Gy (AUC = 0.67; p = 0.0002; Hosmer-Lemeshow p-value, pHL = 0.59).

Methods:   Nine hospital Sites in New South Wales (NSW), Australia with a urological MDT and involvement in a state-wide urological clinical network participated in this pragmatic stepped wedge, cluster randomised implementation trial. Intervention strategies included flagging of high-risk patients by pathologists, clinical leadership, education, and audit and feedback of individuals' and study Sites' practices. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients referred to radiation oncology within 4 months after prostatectomy. Secondary outcomes were proportion of patients discussed at a MDT meeting within 4 months after surgery; proportion of patients who consulted a radiation oncologist within 6 months; and the proportion who commenced radiotherapy within 6 months. Urologists' attitudes towards adjuvant radiotherapy were surveyed pre- and post-intervention. A process evaluation measured intervention fidelity, response to intervention components and contextual factors that impacted on implementation and sustainability.  Results:   Records for 1071 high-risk post-RP patients operated on by 37 urologists were reviewed: 505 control-phase; and 407 intervention-phase. The proportion of patients discussed at a MDT meeting increased from 17% in the control-phase to 59% in the intervention-phase (adjusted RR = 4.32; 95% CI [2.40 to 7.75]; p < 0·001). After adjustment, there was no significant difference in referral to radiation oncology (intervention 32% vs control 30%; adjusted RR = 1.06; 95% CI [0.74 to 1.51]; p = 0.879). Sites with the largest relative increases in the percentage of patients discussed also tended to have greater increases in referral (p = 0·001). In the intervention phase, urologists failed to provide referrals to more than half of patients whom the MDT had recommended for referral (78 of 140; 56%).  Conclusions:   The intervention resulted in significantly more patients being discussed by a MDT. However, the recommendations from MDTs were not uniformly recorded or followed. Although practice varied markedly between MDTs, the intervention did not result in a significant overall change in referral rates, probably reflecting a lack of change in urologists' attitudes. Our results suggest that interventions focused on structures and processes that enable health system-level change, rather than those focused on individual-level change, are likely to have the greatest effect.

Survival time, the impact of smoking on cancer development and the influence of smoking cessation on the prognosis of the development of new malignancies were analyzed. The incidence of multiple primary malignancies in the population of cancer patients amounted to 14.98%. In the group of smokers, those who ceased smoking developed the second primary malignancy later as compared to those who did not: the period between the first and the new cancer was 11.55 years (SD 7.24) for those who quit smoking, whereas for those who continued to smoke after their first cancer diagnosis it was 6.10 years (SD 8.62) (p = 0.005). It was revealed that patients who had never smoked lived longer than those who had continued to smoke (p = 0.004) and that those who had ceased smoking had a longer survival time than those who had not (p = 0.027).

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included 155 men whom underwent 3-Tesla prostate MRI and subsequent MR/US fusion biopsies at a single non-academic center from 11/2014 to 3/2016. All scans were performed with a surface coil and included T2, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences. Suspicious findings were classified using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2 and targeted using MR/US fusion biopsies. Mixed-effect logistic regression analyses were used to determine the ability of PIRADS v2 alone and combined with ADC values to predict CS-PCa. As ADC categories are more practical in clinical situations than numeric values, an additional model with ADC categories of ≤ 800 and > 800 was performed.  Results:   A total of 243 suspicious lesions were included, 69 of which were CS-PCa, 34 were Gleason score 3+3 PCa, and 140 were negative. The overall PIRADS v2 score, ADC values, and ADC categories are independent statistically significant predictors of CS-PCa (p < 0.001). However, the area under the ROC of PIRADS v2 alone and PIRADS v2 with ADC categories are significantly different in both peripheral and transition zone lesions (p = 0.026 and p = 0.03, respectively) Further analysis of the ROC curves also shows that the main benefit of utilizing ADC values or categories is better discrimination of PI-RADS v2 4 lesions.

Methods:   Cases registered by 13 French cancer registries between 1989 and 2010 and followed-up until June 2013 were included. The person-year approach was used to compute standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of metachronous SPC. Usual SIRs and cancer site-specific weighted SIRs called ""case-mix SIRs"" (cmSIRs) were estimated by sex and calendar period of first cancer diagnosis. Calendar trends in SIRs and cmSIRs were compared.  Results:   More than 2.9 million person-years at risk were included. Among males, SIRs dropped from 1.49 to 1.23 between 1989-1994 and 2005-2010, while cmSIRs decreased from 1.40 to 1.27. This difference seems mainly related to a stronger representation of prostate cancers (at lower risk of SPC) and a weaker contribution of bladder and head and neck cancers (at higher risk of SPC) in recent periods of diagnosis. Among females, both SIRs and cmSIRs have remained stable at around 1.22 and 1.21, respectively.

Thus, delays in treatment due to any causes might not affect long-term survival and may not affect cancer cure rates.  Purpose:   In this study, we evaluated the effect of delay-time between PC diagnosis and radical prostatectomy regarding oncological outcomes: Gleason score upgrade on surgical specimen, pathologic extracapsular extension (ECE) on surgical specimen, and postoperative biochemical recurrence (BCR) on follow-up.  Methods:   We evaluated PC patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) regarding clinical and pathological findings and theirs respective interval between diagnosis and surgical treatment measured in days and months. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the impact of interval-time.  Results:   A total of 908 PC patients underwent RP between 2006 and 2014. Mean age was 61.5 years, the mean time-to-surgery was 191 days (> 6 months) and 187 (20.5%) patients had BCR, with a mean follow-up of 44 months. According to our analysis, no statistically significant maximum cut-off time interval between diagnostic biopsy and surgery could be established (p = 0.215).

Results from PCBaSe Sweden: a nationwide cohort study""","""Objectives:   Both prostate cancer (PCa) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are increasingly prevalent conditions, which frequently coexist in men. Here, we set out to specifically examine the impact of a PCa diagnosis and its treatment on T2DM treatment.  Setting:   This study uses observational data from Prostate Cancer database Sweden Traject.  Participants:   The study was undertaken in a cohort of 16 778 men with T2DM, of whom 962 were diagnosed with PCa during mean follow-up of 2.5 years.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   We investigated the association between PCa diagnosis and escalation in T2DM treatment in this cohort. A treatment escalation was defined as a new or change in anti-T2DM prescription, as recorded in the prescribed drug register (ie, change from diet to metformin or sulphonylurea or insulin). We also investigated how PCa diagnosis was associated with two treatment escalations. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression with age as a time scale was used while adjusting for educational level and initial T2DM treatment.  Results:   We found no association between PCa diagnosis and risk of a single treatment escalation (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.13). However, PCa diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of receiving two consecutive T2DM treatment escalations (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.22). This increase was strongest for men on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (HR 3.08, 95% CI 2.14 to 4.40). The corresponding HR for men with PCa not on hormonal treatment was 1.40 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.92) and for men with PCa on antiandrogens 0.91 (95% CI 0.29 to 2.82).  Conclusions:   Men with T2DM who are diagnosed with PCa, particularly those treated with GnRH agonists, were more likely to have two consecutive escalations in T2DM treatment. This suggests a need for closer monitoring of men with both PCa and T2DM, as coexistence of PCa and its subsequent treatments could potentially worsen T2DM control.""","""['Danielle Crawley', 'Hans Garmo', 'Sarah Rudman', 'Pär Stattin', 'Björn Zethelius', 'Jo Armes', 'Lars Holmberg', 'Jan Adolfsson', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Exploring the association between use of gonadotropin releasing hormones agonists and prostate cancer diagnosis per se and diabetes control in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a nationwide, population-based cohort study.', 'Association between duration and type of androgen deprivation therapy and risk of diabetes in men with prostate cancer.', 'Prospective study of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, anti-diabetic drugs and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Repaglinide : a pharmacoeconomic review of its use in type 2 diabetes mellitus.', 'Association between medical androgen deprivation therapy and long-term cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in nonmetastatic prostate cancer.', 'Exploring the association between use of gonadotropin releasing hormones agonists and prostate cancer diagnosis per se and diabetes control in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a nationwide, population-based cohort study.', 'Observation of Efficacy of Internet-Based Chronic Disease Management Model Combined with Modified Therapy of Bushenyiliu Decoction in Treating Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Prostate Cancer and Its Effect on Disease Control Rate.', 'Use of Warfarin or Direct Oral Anticoagulants and Risk of Prostate Cancer in PCBaSe: A Nationwide Case-Control Study.', 'Association of type 2 diabetes mellitus and antidiabetic medication with risk of prostate cancer: a population-based case-control study.']"""

However, therapeutic resistance limits its clinical use in many malignancies, including prostate cancer. Strategies to sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL are urgently needed. We demonstrate here that small-molecule tetrandrine (TET) potentially sensitizes previously resistant (LNCaP and C4-2B cells) and mildly sensitive (PC3 cells) prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and they do so by upregulating mRNA expression and protein levels of death receptors Apo Trail R1 (DR4) and Apo Trail R2 (DR5). Using shRNA knockdown, we show critical requirement of DR4 and DR5 in sensitization of prostate cancer cells to TRAIL. We show that double knockdown of DR4 and DR5 abrogated the apoptotic effects of TET and TRAIL. We also demonstrate that TET-induced DR4 and DR5 expression is independent of p53 status. Given that loss of p53 is associated with progression of prostate cancer to CRPC and NEPC, our results show that TET, by acting as a TRAIL-sensitizing agent in prostate cancer, could serve as a potential therapeutic agent in CRPC and NEPC, for which there is no cure to date.

Secondarily, we aimed to assess short-term biological effects of E2 add-back without increasing circulating TS.  Design:   28-day randomised, placebo-controlled trial.  Methods:   37 participants were randomised to either 0.9 or 1.8 mg of 0.1% E2 gel per day or matched placebo gel. Fasting morning serum hormones, quality of life questionnaires, and treatment side effects were evaluated at baseline, days 14 and 28. Hot flush diaries and other biochemical measurements were completed at baseline and study end.  Results:   Transdermal E2 significantly raised serum E2 from baseline to day 28 compared to placebo in the 0.9 mg dose group (median: 208 pmol/L; interquartile range: 157-332) and in the 1.8 mg dose group (median: 220 pmol/L; interquartile range: 144-660).

Materials:   From June to August 2017, patients candidate to RARP were enrolled and underwent high-resolution multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (1-mm slices) according to dedicated protocol. The obtained three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was integrated in the robotic console to perform AR-RARP. According to the staging at magnetic resonance imaging or reconstruction, in case of cT2 prostate cancer, intrafascial nerve sparing (NS) was performed: a mark was placed on the prostate capsule to indicate the virtual underlying intraprostatic lesion; in case of cT3, standard NS AR-RARP was scheduled with AR-guided biopsy at the level of suspected extracapsular extension (ECE). Prostate specimens were scanned to assess the 3D model concordance.  Results:   Sixteen patients underwent intrafascial NS technique (cT2), whereas 14 underwent standard NS+ selective biopsy of suspected ECE (cT3). Final pathology confirmed clinical staging. Positive surgical margins' rate was 30% (no positive surgical margins in pT2). In patients whose intraprostatic lesions were marked, final pathology confirmed lesion location. In patients with suspected ECE, AR-guided selective biopsies confirmed the ECE location, with 11 of 14 biopsies (78%) positive for prostate cancer. Prostate specimens were scanned with finding of a good overlap. The mismatch between 3D reconstruction and scanning ranged from 1 to 5 mm. In 85% of the entire surface, the mismatch was <3 mm.

Materials and methods:   13 patients had PSMA-PET/CT prior to prostatectomy and histopathological examination. Two GTVs were available: GTV-PET and GTV-histo, which is the true cancer volume. Focused IMRT plans delivering 77 Gy in 35 fractions to the prostate and 95 Gy to PTV-PET were produced. For random portions of the true cancer volume, α and α/β were uniformly changed to represent different radiosensitivity reductions. TCP was calculated (linear quadratic model) for the true cancer volume with and without simulated intrafractional movement.  Results:   Intrafractional movement increased the TCP by up to 10.2% in individual cases and 1.2% averaged over all cases for medium radiosensitivity levels. At lower levels of radiosensitivity, movement decreased the TCP. Radiosensitivity reductions of 10-20% led to TCP reductions of 1-24% and 10-68% for 1% and 5% affected cancer volume, respectively. There is no linear correlation but a sudden breakdown of TCPs within a small range of radiosensitivity levels.  Conclusion:   TCP drops significantly within a narrow range of radiosensitivity levels.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the association between 5-ARI treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms and the risk for PC.  Methods:   This is a population-based prospective study on all men age 40 years and older with at least one prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test in Stockholm County from January 2007 until December 2015. Data are derived from the Stockholm PSA and Biopsy Register and Prescribed Drug Register in Sweden, containing data on 5-ARI-use before diagnosis of PC. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the cause-specific hazard ratios of PC for each exposure level relative to men not taking the medication.  Results:   Of the 333 820 men in the cohort, 23 442 (7.0%) were exposed to 5-ARI at some time during the study period of eight years. Treatment with 5-ARI decreased the risk for overall PC, and the effect was larger with longer time of exposure (0.1 to 2 years: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.71 to 0.93; 2 to 4 years: HR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.47; 4 to 6 years: HR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.31 to 0.52; and 6 to 8 years: HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.60). Specifically, 5-ARI decreased the risk for PC with Gleason Scores 6 and 7 but did not statistically significantly affect the long-term risk of being diagnosed with a PC with a Gleason Score of 8 to 10 with up to eight years of treatment.

In this study, we further demonstrate that this technique could be used for characterization of tumors and/or identification of cellular masses of unknown origin due to the release of multiple protein and nucleic acid biomarkers in cells in culture, mice and patients. We sonicated colon (LS174T) and prostate (LNCaP) cancer cell lines in culture at a low frequency of 1 MHz and show that there were several-fold changes in multiple protein and microRNA (miRNA) abundance with treatment at various intensities and time. This release was dependent on the duration and intensity of the sonication for both cell lines. Significant increased release in biomarkers was also observed following tumor sonication in living mice bearing subcutaneous LS174T cell line xenografts (for proteins and nucleic acids) and in an experimental LS174T liver tumor model (for proteins only). Finally, we demonstrated this methodology of multiple biomarker release in patients undergoing ablation of uterine fibroids using MR guided high intensity focused ultrasound. Two protein biomarkers significantly increased in the plasma after the ultrasound treatment in 21 samples tested. This proof that ultrasound-amplification method works in soft tissue tumor models together with biomarker multiplexing, could allow for an effective non-invasive method for identification, characterization and localization of incidental lesions, cancer and other disease. Pre-treatment quantification of the biomarkers, allows for individualization of quantitative comparisons. This individualization of normal marker levels in this method allows for specificity of the biomarker-increase to each patient, tumor or organ being studied.""","""[""Aloma L D'Souza"", 'John R Chevillet', 'Pejman Ghanouni', 'Xinrui Yan', 'Muneesh Tewari', 'Sanjiv S Gambhir']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Release of Cell-free MicroRNA Tumor Biomarkers into the Blood Circulation with Pulsed Focused Ultrasound: A Noninvasive, Anatomically Localized, Molecular Liquid Biopsy.', 'Liquid biopsy in mice bearing colorectal carcinoma xenografts: gateways regulating the levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and miRNA (ctmiRNA).', 'Plasma exosome microRNAs are indicative of breast cancer.', 'MicroRNAs in the development and pathobiology of uterine leiomyomata: does evidence support future strategies for clinical intervention?', 'Recent Advances in Uterine Fibroid Etiology.', 'Barrier-breaking effects of ultrasonic cavitation for drug delivery and biomarker release.', 'A Review of Imaging Methods to Assess Ultrasound-Mediated Ablation.', 'Ultrasound-Based Method for the Identification of Novel MicroRNA Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer.', 'Biomarkers and focused ultrasound: the future of liquid biopsy for brain tumor patients.', 'Pushing the detection limits: strategies towards highly sensitive optical-based protein detection.']"""

Objective:   - To assess the clinical utility of urinary PCA3 in men at risk of PCa.  Design:   - We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 271 men (median age, 63 years) with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and/or strong family history, and/or abnormal digital rectal examination findings. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR-), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) were evaluated.  Results:   - PCA3 score was a significant predictor of prostate biopsy outcome ( P < .001). A PCA3 score of 30 was the optimal cutoff for our study cohort, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 72.7%, specificity of 67.5%, PPV of 47.1%, NPV of 86.2%, LR+ of 2.24, LR- of 0.40, and DOR of 5.55. At this cutoff score, the PCA3 assay could avoid 57.4% of unnecessary invasive biopsies in the overall study cohort and 70.3% in the subgroup with PSA level in the ""gray zone"" (4-10 ng/mL). A logistic regression algorithm combining PCA3 with PSA increased the AUC from 0.571 for PSA-only to 0.729 ( P < .001). The logistic combined marker gained the ability to discriminate low-grade from high-grade cancers.

Understanding their perception of sleep problems is important as subjective symptom experience is associated with treatment-seeking behavior. We explored the prevalence of sleep problems and its correlates in a large sample of cancer patients at an important but understudied stage of their cancer journey: prior to initiating treatment.  Methods:   Cancer patients (5702) (67.5% female; 76.9% White; 23.0% Hispanic), following diagnosis and prior to initiating cancer treatment, completed an electronic screening instrument. Patients across eight different cancer diagnoses (breast, gastrointestinal, gynecological, head and neck, hematological, lung, prostate, urinary) rated their sleep problems on a five-point scale, with those reporting ""severe"" or ""very severe"" sleep problems classified as having high sleep problems.  Results:   Overall, 12.5% of patients reported high sleep problems. Across diagnoses, the proportion of patients reporting high sleep problems ranged from 4.3 to 13.8%, with prostate cancer patients least likely and gastrointestinal cancer patients most likely to report high sleep problems. Older age, having a partner, higher education, and higher household income were associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing sleep problems. Being female, Black, Hispanic, and reporting anxiety or depression was associated with an increased likelihood of sleep problems.  Conclusions:   A sizeable proportion of cancer patients experience significant problems with their sleep before any treatment has occurred. This clinical issue cannot be ignored as treatment is likely to worsen existing sleep problems. Oncology providers should routinely screen for sleep-related problems. Identifying and treating patients for sleep problems during a vulnerable period early in their cancer trajectory should be an essential component of clinical care.""","""['Eric S Zhou', 'Karen Clark', 'Christopher J Recklitis', 'Richard Obenchain', 'Matthew Loscalzo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Behav Med""","""['Caregiver reports of sleep problems in non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and African American patients with Alzheimer dementia.', 'Behaviors of children who are exposed and not exposed to intimate partner violence: an analysis of 330 black, white, and Hispanic children.', 'Predictors of PTSD Symptom Change Among Outpatients in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System.', 'COVID-19 pandemic: demographic and clinical correlates of disturbed sleep among 6,041 Canadians.', 'Symptom and function profiles of men with localized prostate cancer.', '""I Beat Cancer to Feel Sick:"" Qualitative Experiences of Sleep Disturbance in Black Breast Cancer Survivors and Recommendations for Culturally Targeted Sleep Interventions.', 'Testing delivery of components of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia to breast cancer survivors by smart speaker: a study protocol.', 'Sleep During Oncological Treatment - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Associations With Treatment Response, Time to Progression and Survival.', 'Systematic review of sleep and sleep disorders among prostate cancer patients and caregivers: a call to action for using validated sleep assessments during prostate cancer care.', 'Factors Affecting the Severity of Fatigue during Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer; an Exploratory Study.']"""

Objectives:   Identify consultation profiles and clinical features in patients with the seven most common cancers, who had consulted a general practitioner (GP) frequently before their cancer diagnosis.  Methods:   A case-control study was conducted in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden. A total of 2570 patients, diagnosed in 2011 with prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, gynaecological and skin cancers including malignant melanoma, and 9424 controls were selected from the Swedish Cancer Register and a regional health care database. Diagnostic codes [International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10)] from primary care for patients with ≥4 GP consultations registered in the year before cancer diagnosis were collected. Likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated for variables associated with the different cancers.  Results:   Fifty-six percent of the patients had consulted a GP four or more times in the year before cancer diagnosis. Alarm symptoms or signs represented 60% of the codes with the highest LR, but only 40% of the 10 most prevalent codes. Breast lump had the highest LR, 11.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.0-17.8]; abnormalities of plasma proteins had an LR of 5.0 (95% CI 3.0-8.2) and abnormal serum enzyme levels had an LR of 4.6 (95% CI 3.6-5.9). Early clinical features associated with cancer had been registered already at the first two GP consultations.

This study observed an aberrant accumulation of cholesteryl ester in metastatic lesions using Raman spectroscopic analysis of lipid droplets in human prostate cancer patient tissues. Inhibition of cholesterol esterification in prostate cancer cells significantly suppresses the development and growth of metastatic cancer lesions in both orthotopic and intracardiac injection mouse models. Gene expression profiling reveals that cholesteryl ester depletion suppresses the metastatic potential through upregulation of multiple regulators that negatively impact metastasis. In addition, Wnt/β-catenin, a vital pathway for metastasis, is downregulated upon cholesteryl ester depletion. Mechanistically, inhibition of cholesterol esterification significantly blocks secretion of Wnt3a through reduction of monounsaturated fatty acid levels, which limits Wnt3a acylation. These results collectively validate cholesterol esterification as a novel metabolic target for treating metastatic prostate cancer.

In this study, we investigated the role of c-Myc-regulated glycolysis in prostate cancer chemoprevention by PEITC. Exposure of LNCaP (androgen-responsive) and 22Rv1 (castration-resistant) human prostate cancer cells to PEITC resulted in suppression of expression as well as transcriptional activity of c-Myc. Prostate cancer cell growth inhibition by PEITC was significantly attenuated by stable overexpression of c-Myc. Analysis of the RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas indicated a significant positive association between Myc expression and gene expression of many glycolysis-related genes, including hexokinase II and lactate dehydrogenase A Expression of these enzyme proteins and lactate levels were decreased upon PEITC treatment in prostate cancer cells, and these effects were significantly attenuated by ectopic expression of c-Myc. A normal prostate stromal cell line (PrSC) was resistant to lactic acid suppression by PEITC treatment. Prostate cancer chemoprevention by PEITC in TRAMP mice was associated with a significant decrease in plasma lactate and pyruvate levels. However, a 1-week intervention with 10 mg PEITC (orally, 4 times/day) was not sufficient to decrease lactate levels in the serum of human subjects. These results indicated that although prostate cancer prevention by PEITC in TRAMP mice was associated with suppression of glycolysis, longer than 1-week intervention might be necessary to observe such an effect in human subjects.

Materials and methods:   Using Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data (2012-2015), we assessed provider payments to physicians and ASCs for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies (Current Procedural Terminology 55700, 76842, 76972) for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. Data were aggregated at provider-level for those reporting >10 biopsies per year. Hospital payments were estimated based on Outpatient Prospective Payment System. We report average and total payments for physicians, hospitals, and ASCs.  Results:   We identified 534,807 prostate biopsies, of which 13.3% and 14.8% were associated with an ASC and hospital, respectively. Payments for all biopsies totaled $276.7 million ($152.7 million to physicians; $35.1 million to ASCs, $88.9 million to hospitals). From 2012 through 2015, physician payments for biopsies declined by $19 million (Δ=-43.2%, P = .06 for trend). Payments to ASCs (+$3.2 million, Δ = 38.8%, P = .29) and hospitals (+$11.1 million, Δ = 58.6%, P = .16) both increased. The decline in physician payments was due to a 13.7% decline in volume and lower median reimbursement for office-based procedures ($415 to $277, P = .04). The share of biopsies performed at facilities increased from 26.5% to 30.0%, and the proportion of payments associated with those settings also increased from 42.7% to 65.3%.

Objective:   To identify CRPC driver genes that may provide new targets to enhance CRPC therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of HNPCs that develop CRPC following host castration were examined for changes in expression of genes at various time points after castration using transcriptome profiling analysis; particular attention was given to pre-CRPC changes in expression indicative of genes acting as potential CRPC drivers.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The functionality of a potential CRPC driver was validated via its knockdown in cultured prostate cancer cells; its clinical relevance was established using data from prostate cancer patient databases.  Results and limitations:   Eighty genes were found to be significantly upregulated at the CRPC stage, while seven of them also showed elevated expression prior to CRPC development. Among the latter, growth factor receptor bound protein 10 (GRB10) was the most significantly and consistently upregulated gene. Moreover, elevated GRB10 expression in clinical prostate cancer samples correlated with more aggressive tumor types and poorer patient treatment outcome. GRB10 knockdown markedly reduced prostate cancer cell proliferation and activity of AKT, a well-established CRPC mediator. A positive correlation between AKT activity and GRB10 expression was also found in clinical cohorts.  Conclusions:   GRB10 acts as a driver of CRPC and sensitizes androgen receptor pathway inhibitors, and hence GRB10 targeting provides a novel therapeutic strategy for the disease.  Patient summary:   Development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a major problem in the management of the disease. Using state-of-the-art patient-derived hormone-naive prostate cancer xenograft models, we found and validated the growth factor receptor bound protein 10 gene as a driver of CRPC, indicating that it may be used as a new molecular target to enhance current CRPC therapy.""","""['Jun Hao', 'Xinpei Ci', 'Hui Xue', 'Rebecca Wu', 'Xin Dong', 'Stephen Yiu Chuen Choi', 'Haiqing He', 'Yu Wang', 'Fang Zhang', 'Sifeng Qu', 'Fan Zhang', 'Anne M Haegert', 'Peter W Gout', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Colin Collins', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Dong Lin', 'Yuzhuo Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['GRB10 sustains AR activity by interacting with PP2A in prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting KDM4B that coactivates c-Myc-regulated metabolism to suppress tumor growth in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Non-Coding RNAs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling and Cancer Metabolism.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Influence of ADT on B7-H3 expression during CRPC progression from hormone-naïve prostate cancer.', 'Treatment of Prostate Cancer with CD46-targeted 225Ac Alpha Particle Radioimmunotherapy.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.', 'Immunosuppressive environment in response to androgen deprivation treatment in prostate cancer.', 'In Vivo Models for Prostate Cancer Research.']"""

Deregulated mTOR signaling is implicated in a wide spectrum of human malignancies including prostate cancer. The aim of this study is to address the role of phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR) in prostate adenocarcinoma-induced lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis as well as to investigate its relationship with chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcriptional factor 2 (COUP-TFII) and the vascular endothelial growth factors A/C (VEGF A/C).  Methods:   We analyzed 92 paraffin embedded specimens from patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node (LN) dissection. Twenty-four of these men were pathologically assessed to have regional LN metastasis (pN1 group) and 68 with negative lymph nodes (pN0 group). Lymph vessel density was measured using anti-D2-40 and anti-LYVE-1 antibodies. The expression of p-mTOR, COUP-TFII, and VEGF A/C was also evaluated by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Specimens from pN1 group exhibited higher cytoplasmic p-mTOR expression compared to pN0 specimens. Mean vessel densities assessed by COUP-TFII and D2-40 were increased in pN1 tumors and positively associated with higher p-mTOR expression. Interestingly, increased expression of p-mTOR was positively associated with COUP-TFII expression in cancer cells and elevated immunoreactivity for both VEGF A and C, which in turn exhibited higher expression in pN1 group.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that increased p-mTOR and COUP-TFII expression are implicated in human prostate adenocarcinoma-induced lymphangiogenesis and LN metastasis.""","""['Ioannis Lilis', 'Ioanna Giopanou', 'Helen Papadaki', 'Kostis Gyftopoulos']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II in human breast carcinoma: possible regulator of lymphangiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor-C expression.', 'Semaphorin 4D expression is associated with a poor clinical outcome in cervical cancer patients.', 'Direct transcriptional regulation of neuropilin-2 by COUP-TFII modulates multiple steps in murine lymphatic vessel development.', 'COUP-TFII in Health and Disease.', 'Multiple roles of COUP-TFII in cancer initiation and progression.', 'Loss of MIR503HG facilitates papillary renal cell carcinoma associated lymphatic metastasis by triggering NOTCH1/VEGFC signaling.', 'The Role of ERα and ERβ in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Current Therapeutic Approaches.', 'Coexpression of TLR9 and VEGF-C is associated with lymphatic metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Cell Plasticity and Prostate Cancer: The Role of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Tumor Progression, Invasion, Metastasis and Cancer Therapy Resistance.', 'Distinct roles for the RNA-binding protein Staufen1 in prostate cancer.']"""

This study aims to evaluate direct-to-consumer advertising content and claims made by proton therapy centre (PTC) websites worldwide.  Methods:   Operational PTC websites in English were identified through the Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group website. Data abstraction of website content was performed independently by two investigators. Eight international guidelines were consulted to determine guideline-based indications for proton radiotherapy. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the characteristics of PTC websites that indicated proton radiotherapy offered greater disease control or cure rates.  Results:   Forty-eight PTCs with 46 English websites were identified. 60·9% of PTC websites claimed proton therapy provided improved disease control or cure. U.S. websites listed more indications than international websites (15·5 ± 5·4 vs. 10·4 ± 5·8, p = 0·004). The most common disease sites advertised were prostate (87·0%), head and neck (87·0%) and pediatrics (82·6%), all of which were indicated in least one international guideline. Several disease sites advertised were not present in any consensus guidelines, including pancreatobiliary (52·2%), breast (50·0%), and esophageal (43·5%) cancers. Multivariate analysis found increasing number of disease sites and claiming their centre was a local or regional leader in proton radiotherapy was associated with indicating proton radiotherapy offers greater disease control or cure.  Conclusions:   Information from PTC websites often differs from recommendations found in international consensus guidelines. As online marketing information may have significant influence on patient decision-making, alignment of such information with accepted guidelines and consensus opinion should be adopted by PTC providers.""","""['Mark T Corkum', 'Wei Liu', 'David A Palma', 'Glenn S Bauman', 'Robert E Dinniwell', 'Andrew Warner', 'Mark V Mishra', 'Alexander V Louie']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Proton therapy for prostate cancer online: patient education or marketing?', 'Assessing ""Cell Therapy"" Clinics Offering Treatments of Ocular Conditions using Direct-to-Consumer Marketing Websites in the United States.', 'Promotion and marketing of bioidentical hormone therapy on the internet: a content analysis of websites.', 'Direct-to-consumer advertising for robotic surgery.', 'Non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy: a systematic review of Internet advertising to potential users by commercial companies and private health providers.', 'Assessment of Proton Beam Therapy Use Among Patients With Newly Diagnosed Cancer in the US, 2004-2018.', 'Overall Survival After Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer With Proton Beam Therapy, External-Beam Photon Therapy, or Brachytherapy.', 'Is there any benefit to particles over photon radiotherapy?', 'Reddit and Radiation Therapy: A Descriptive Analysis of Posts and Comments Over 7\xa0Years by Patients and Health Care Professionals.', 'Proton versus photon-based radiation therapy for prostate cancer: emerging evidence and considerations in the era of value-based cancer care.']"""

Herein, we explore whether gains in cardiovascular fitness predict successful weight loss in men participating in a weight loss trial (NCT01886677).  Methods:   Forty men were randomized to receive twice-weekly in-person and telephone-based guidance on calorie-restricted diets and aerobic exercise to promote ~0.91 kg/week weight loss, or wait-list control. Thirty-two men completed submaximal VO2 Treadmill Tests (TT), anthropometric measures and two 24-hour dietary recalls at baseline and follow-up. For this secondary analysis, study arms were combined and associations between baseline and longitudinal changes in physiological effort (PE, measured by heart rate during TT), predicted VO2max, caloric intake and weight loss were analyzed.  Results:   Men lost 3.4 kg in 50 ± 23 days on the study. Multivariate linear regression indicated weight change was associated with change in PE at stage 2TT (Partial R = 0.635, p < 0.001), days on study (Partial R = -0.589, p = 0.002) and change in caloric intake (Partial R = 0.457, p = 0.019).  Conclusions:   Untrained men experiencing elevated heart rates during stage 2TT at baseline were able to achieve greater weight loss over the study period; this association was strengthened by a decrease in PE at the same level from baseline to follow-up concomitant with reduced caloric intake. Therefore, for these middle-aged and older men with lower aerobic fitness, exercise appears to be a key factor in achieving higher degrees of weight loss.""","""['Andrew D Frugé', 'John A Dasher', 'David Bryan', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami', 'Wendy Demark-Wahnefried', 'Gary R Hunter']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Int J Cancer Clin Res""","""['Dietary Changes Impact the Gut Microbe Composition in Overweight and Obese Men\xa0with Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical\xa0Prostatectomy.', 'The effect of weight management interventions that include a diet component on weight-related outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women: a systematic review protocol.', 'Changes in Dietary Inflammatory Index Patterns with Weight Loss in Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Weight Loss Interventions to Prevent Obesity-Related Morbidity and Mortality in Adults: An Updated Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'WITHDRAWN: Advice on low-fat diets for obesity.', 'Diet and lifestyle considerations for patients with prostate cancer.']"""

We focused on colorectal cancer.  Materials and methods:   We obtained cancer death certification data from stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus, ovary, prostate, bladder, leukaemia, and total cancers from the World Health Organisation database and projected population data from Eurostat. We derived figures for France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the UK, and the EU in 1970-2012. We predicted death numbers by age group and age-standardized (world population) rates for 2018 through joinpoint regression models.  Results:   EU total cancer mortality rates are predicted to decline by 10.3% in men between 2012 and 2018, reaching a predicted rate of 128.9/100 000, and by 5.0% in women with a rate of 83.6. The predicted total number of cancer deaths is 1 382 000 when compared with 1 333 362 in 2012 (+3.6%). We confirmed a further fall in male lung cancer, but an unfavourable trend in females, with a rate of 14.7/100 000 for 2018 (13.9 in 2012, +5.8%) and 94 500 expected deaths, higher than the rate of 13.7 and 92 700 deaths from breast cancer. Colorectal cancer predicted rates are 15.8/100 000 men (-6.7%) and 9.2 in women (-7.5%); declines are expected in all age groups. Pancreatic cancer is stable in men, but in women it rose +2.8% since 2012. Ovarian, uterine and bladder cancer rates are predicted to decline further. In 2018 alone, about 392 300 cancer deaths were avoided compared with peak rates in the late 1980s.  Conclusion:   We predicted continuing falls in mortality rates from major cancer sites in the EU and its major countries to 2018. Exceptions are pancreatic cancer and lung cancer in women.

Methods Using the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database, we identified men who received radiation for prostate cancer between 2008 and 2015. Patients undergoing proton therapy and SBRT were propensity score-matched to IMRT patients on the basis of clinical and sociodemographic factors. Proportional hazards models compared the cumulative incidence of urinary, bowel, and erectile dysfunction toxicities by treatment. Cost from a payer's perspective was calculated from claims and adjusted to 2015 dollars. Results A total of 693 proton therapy patients were matched to 3,465 IMRT patients. Proton therapy patients had a lower risk of composite urinary toxicity (33% v 42% at 2 years; P < .001) and erectile dysfunction (21% v 28% at 2 years; P < .001), but a higher risk of bowel toxicity (20% v 15% at 2 years; P = .02). Mean radiation cost was $115,501 for proton therapy patients and $59,012 for IMRT patients ( P < .001). A total of 310 SBRT patients were matched to 3,100 IMRT patients. There were no significant differences in composite urinary, bowel, or erectile dysfunction toxicities between SBRT and IMRT patients ( P > .05), although a higher risk of urinary fistula was noted with SBRT (1% v 0.1% at 2 years; P = .009). Mean radiation cost for SBRT was $49,504 and $57,244 for IMRT ( P < .001). Conclusion Among younger men with prostate cancer, proton radiation was associated with significant reductions in urinary toxicity but increased bowel toxicity at nearly twice the cost of IMRT. SBRT and IMRT were associated with similar toxicity profiles; SBRT was modestly less expensive than IMRT.""","""['Hubert Y Pan', 'Jing Jiang', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Chad Tang', 'Seungtaek L Choi', 'Quynh-Nhu Nguyen', 'Steven J Frank', 'Mitchell S Anscher', 'Ya-Chen Tina Shih', 'Benjamin D Smith']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['A Younger Man With Localized Prostate Cancer Asks, ""Which Type of Radiation Is Right for Me?"".', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: comparison of toxicity.', 'Use, complications, and costs of stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of SBRT versus IMRT for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Cost of New Technologies in Prostate Cancer Treatment: Systematic Review of Costs and Cost Effectiveness of Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy, Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy, and Proton Beam Therapy.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Income level and treatment selection in prostate cancer: analysis of a North Carolina population-based cohort.', 'Proton versus photon radiation therapy: A clinical review.', 'Dose prescription and reporting in stereotactic body radiotherapy: A multi-institutional study.', 'Application of individualized multimodal radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy in metastatic tumors.', 'Systematic study of the iodinated rectal hydrogel spacer material discrepancy on accuracy of proton dosimetry.']"""

This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the difference of p16 and p14 methylation between PCa and different histological types of nonmalignant controls and the correlation of p16 or p14 methylation with clinicopathological features of PCa.  Methods:   According to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement criteria, articles were searched in PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, Wanfang, and CNKI databases. The strength of correlation was calculated by the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to estimate the required population information for significant results.  Results:   A total of 20 studies published from 1997 to 2017 were identified in this meta-analysis, including 1140 PCa patients and 530 cases without cancer. Only p16 methylation in PCa was significantly higher than in benign prostatic lesions (OR = 4.72, P = .011), but had a similar level in PCa and adjacent tissues or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias (HGPIN). TSA revealed that this analysis on p16 methylation is a false positive result in cancer versus benign prostatic lesions (the estimated required information size of 5116 participants). p16 methylation was not correlated with PCa in the urine and blood. Besides, p16 methylation was not linked to clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and Gleason score (GS) of patients with PCa. p14 methylation was not correlated with PCa in tissue and urine samples. No correlation was observed between p14 methylation and clinical stage or GS. CDKN2A mutation and copy number alteration were not associated with prognosis of PCa in overall survival and disease-free survival. CDKN2A expression was not correlated with the prognosis of PCa in overall survival (492 cases) (P > .1), while CDKN2A expression was significantly associated with a poor disease-free survival (P < .01).  Conclusion:   CDKN2A methylation may not be significantly associated with the development, progression of PCa. Although CDKN2A expression had an unfavorable prognosis in disease-free survival.

Alterations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene are involved in neuroblastoma, lung cancer, and other malignancies, but its role in SCCP has not been documented. We describe a patient with refractory de novo SCCP with ALK F1174C-activating mutation who obtained clinical benefit from treatment with ALK inhibitor.Experimental Design: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze primary and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Prostate cancer databases were queried for alterations in ALK gene, mRNA, and its impact in clinical outcomes. In vitro prostate cell line/organoid models were generated by lentiviral-mediated expression of ALK and ALK F1174C and assessed for response to ALK inhibitors crizotinib and alectinib.Results: NGS analysis of the primary tumor and ctDNA of a 39-year-old patient with refractory SSCP identified ALK F1174C mutation. Treatment with second-generation ALK inhibitor alectinib resulted in radiographic stable disease for over 6 months, symptomatic improvement, and significant molecular response as reflected by declining ctDNA allele fraction. Analysis of prostate cancer datasets showed that ALK amplification was associated with poor outcome. In prostate cancer cells and organoids, ALK F1174C expression enhanced growth and induced expression of the neuroendocrine marker neuron-specific enolase. Alectinib was more effective than crizotinib in inhibiting ALK F1174C-expressing cell growth.Conclusions: These findings implicate ALK-activating mutations in SCCP pathogenesis and suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting ALK molecular alterations in some patients with SCCP.

Methods and materials:   In [18F]-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT scans of 40 consecutive patients with ≤4 metachronous metastases treated with SBRT we retrospectively measured the number of metastases, standardized uptake values (SUVmean, SUVmax, SUVpeak), metabolically active tumor volume (MATV), and total lesion choline uptake. Partial-volume correction was applied using the iterative deconvolution Lucy-Richardson algorithm.  Results:   Thirty-seven lymph node and 13 bone metastases were treated with SBRT. Thirty-three patients (82.5%) had 1 lesion, 4 (10%) had 2 lesions, and 3 (7.5%) had 3 lesions. After a median follow-up of 32.6 months (interquartile range, 35.5 months), the median PFS was 11.5 months (95% confidence interval 8.4-14.6 months). Having more than a single metastasis was a significant prognostic factor (hazard ratio 2.74; P = .03), and there was a trend in risk of progression for large MATV (hazard ratio 1.86; P = .10). No SUV or total lesion choline uptake was significantly predictive for PFS, regardless of partial-volume correction. All PET semiquantitative parameters were significantly correlated with each other (P ≤ .013).  Conclusions:   The number of choline-avid metastases was a significant prognostic factor for progression after [18F]-fluormethylcholine PET/CT-guided SBRT for recurrent oligometastatic prostate cancer, and there seemed to be a trend in risk of progression for patients with large MATVs.

Methods and materials:   Consecutive patients treated with intensity modulated hypoPORT (2.5 Gy per fraction, median cumulative dose 65 Gy [range, 57.5-70 Gy]) or coPORT (1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction, median cumulative dose 66 Gy [range, 60-74 Gy]) between 2005 and 2016 at 2 institutions constituted the study cohort. Acute toxicity and cumulative late grade 2 and ≥3 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity incidences were calculated for all patients using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between cohorts. Biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) was calculated in patients with ≥12 months' follow-up.  Results:   Median follow-up for all 461 patients was 38.6 months. Of the 461 patients, 167 (36%) received hypoPORT, and 294 (64%) patients received coPORT. The hypoPORT cohort had significantly worse baseline urinary incontinence. Acute grade ≥2 GU toxicity was more common after hypoPORT (22% vs 8%) (P = .0001). Late grade ≥3 GU toxicity cumulative incidence at 6 years was 11% (hypoPORT) and 4% (coPORT) (P = .0081). However, hypoPORT was not associated with late grade ≥2 GU toxicity on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 0.86-2.34) (P = .18). There was no difference in acute or late GI toxicity. In the subset of patients with ≥12 month's follow-up (n = 364, median follow-up 52 months), 4-year bPFS was 78% (95% CI 69.4-85.0) after hypoPORT (P = .0038) and 65% (95% CI 57.6-71.1) after coPORT.

However, the molecular mechanism of miR-452-5p in prostate cancer remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the network of target genes of miR-452-5p in prostate cancer using bioinformatics analyses.  Materials and methods:   We first analyzed the expression profiles and prognostic value of miR-452-5p in prostate cancer tissues from a public database. Gene Ontology (GO), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), PANTHER pathway analyses, and a disease ontology (DG) analysis were performed to find the molecular functions of the target genes from GSE datasets and miRWalk. Finally, we validated hub genes from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the target genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). Narrowing down the optimal target genes was conducted by seeking the common parts of up-regulated genes from GEPIA, down-regulated genes from GSE datasets, and predicted genes in miRWalk.  Results:   Based on mining of GEO and ArrayExpress microarray chips and miRNA-Seq data in the TCGA database, which includes 1007 prostate cancer samples and 387 non-cancer samples, miR-452-5p is shown to be down-regulated in prostate cancer. GO, KEGG, and PANTHER pathway analyses suggested that the target genes might participate in important biological processes, such as transforming growth factor beta signaling and the positive regulation of brown fat cell differentiation and mesenchymal cell differentiation, as well as the Ras signaling pathway and pathways regulating the pluripotency of stem cells and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Nine genes-GABBR, PNISR, NTSR1, DOCK1, EREG, SFRP1, PTGS2, LEF1, and BMP2-were defined as hub genes in the PPI network. Three genes-FAM174B, SLC30A4, and SLIT1-were jointly shared by GEPIA, the GSE datasets, and miRWalk.

In this work, we demonstrate a simple yet sensitive sandwich-type single-particle enumeration (SPE) immunoassay for the quantitative detection of PSA in a flow chamber. The design is based on the luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) between upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and gold nanoparticles (GNPs). The carboxyl group-functionalized UCNPs are conjugated with anti-PSA detection antibodies (Ab1) and serve as the luminescence energy donor, while GNPs are modified with anti-PSA capture antibodies (Ab2) and act as the energy acceptor. In the presence of target antigen (i.e., PSA), the specific immnuoreaction brings the donor and acceptor into close proximity, resulting in quenched luminescence. Through statistical counting of the target-dependent fluorescent particles on the glass slide surface, the quantity of antigens in the solution is accurately determined. The dynamic range for PSA detection in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) is 0-500 pM and the limit-of-detection (LOD) is 1.0 pM, which is much lower than the cutoff level in patients' serum samples. In the serum sample assay, comparable LOD was also achieved (i.e., 2.3 pM).

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 31 NM-CRPC patients consecutively treated with definitive EBRT. The median age was 74 years upon EBRT initiation. The initial T stage distribution was as follows: T1c in 3, T2 in 11, T3 in 14, and T4 in 3 cases, respectively. The median prostate dose was 70.4 Gy. A castration-resistant status was defined as continuously increasing serum prostate-specific antigen levels despite ongoing hormonal therapy (HT).  Results:   The median follow-up duration after EBRT was 66.6 months. The median period of primary HT was 18.0 months. The 5- and 8-year overall survival rates were 74.6 and 49.8%, respectively. The 5- and 8-year prostate cancer-specific survival rates were 77.4 and 51.7%, respectively. Fourteen patients died, and prostate cancer was the cause of death in 12 of these patients. The 5- and 8-year relapse-free survival rates were 32.3 and 25.8%, respectively. Among 23 patients who experienced biochemical or clinical failure, the median duration to recurrence after EBRT was 19.3 months. The 5- and 8-year clinical failure-free survival rates were 56.0 and 51.4%, respectively. Among the 14 patients who experienced clinical failure, the median duration after EBRT was 16.0 months. The local relapse-free rates at 5 and 8 years were 91.0 and 91.0%, respectively. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were observed in four patients.  Conclusion:   Definitive EBRT achieved a long-term disease-free and clinical failure-free status in approximately one-third of and half of the treated NM-CRPC patients, respectively. This approach was also associated with favorable local relapse-free rates and overall survival outcomes.

The objective was to understand the biology of tumors not visible on MRI that may go undiagnosed and untreated. Methods: Prostate cancers visible or invisible on multiparametric MRI were macrodissected and examined by RNAseq. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on MRI visibility status were cross-referenced with publicly available gene expression databases to identify genes associated with disease progression. Genes with potential roles in determining MRI visibility and disease progression were knocked down in murine prostate cancer xenografts, and imaged by MRI. Results: RNAseq identified 1,654 DEGs based on MRI visibility status. Comparison of DEGs based on MRI visibility and tumor characteristics revealed that Gleason score (dissimilarity test, p<0.0001) and tumor size (dissimilarity test, p<0.039) did not completely determine MRI visibility. Genes in previously reported prognostic signatures significantly correlated with MRI visibility suggesting that MRI visibility was prognostic. Cross-referencing DEGs with external datasets identified four genes (PHYHD1, CENPF, ALDH2, GDF15) that predict MRI visibility, progression free survival and metastatic deposits. Genetic modification of a human prostate cancer cell line to induce miR-101 and suppress CENPF decreased cell migration and invasion. As prostate cancer xenografts in mice, these cells had decreased visibility on diffusion weighted MRI and decreased perfusion, which correlated with immunostaining showing decreased cell density and proliferation.

However, the therapeutic efficacy needs improvement, and further development of PDT for PCa has challenges, including uncertainty of photosensitizers (PSs) accumulation at the tumor site and difficulty in visualizing lesions using conventional ultrasound (US) imaging. We have developed novel porphyrin-grafted lipid (PGL) microbubbles (MBs; PGL-MBs) and propose a strategy to integrate PGL-MBs with US imaging to address these limitations and enhance PDT efficacy.  Methods:   PGL-MBs have two functions: imaging guidance by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and targeted delivery of PSs by ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD). PGL-MBs were prepared and characterized before and after low-frequency US (LFUS) exposure. Then, in vitro studies validated the efficacy of PDT with PGL-MBs in human prostate cancer PC3 cells. PC3-xenografted nude mice were used to validate CEUS imaging, accumulation at the tumor site, and in vivo PDT efficacy.  Results:   PGL-MBs showed good contrast enhancement for US imaging and were converted into nanoparticles upon LFUS exposure. The resulting uniquely structured nanoparticles avoided porphyrin fluorescence quenching and efficiently accumulated at the tumor site through the sonoporation effect created with the assistance of US to achieve excellent PDT efficacy.  Conclusions:   This is the first preclinical investigation of MBs applied in PDT for PCa. PGL-MBs possess favorable CEUS imaging effects to enhance the localization of tumors. PGL-MBs with LFUS control PS accumulation at the tumor site to achieve highly effective PDT of PCa.

Immune check point blocking antibodies have revolutionized treatment of multiple solid tumors, but results in prostate cancer remain marginal. Previous reports have suggested that local therapies, in particular cryoablation might increase tumor immunogenicity. In this work, we examine potential synergism between tumor cryoabalation and check point blocking antibodies.  Methods:   FVB/NJ mice were injected subcutaneously into each flank with either 1 × 106 or 0.2 × 106 isogenic hormone sensitive Myc-Cap cells to establish synchronous grafts. Mice were treated with four intraperitoneal injections of anti-PD-1 (10 mg/kg), anti-CTLA-4 (1 mg/kg), or isotype control antibody with or without adjuvant cryoablation of the larger tumor graft and with or without neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation with degarelix (ADT). Mouse survival and growth rates of tumor grafts were measured. The immune dependency of observed oncological effects was evaluated by T cell depletion experiments.  Results:   Treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody and cryoablation delayed the growth of the distant tumor by 14.8 days (p = 0.0006) and decreased the mortality rate by factor of 4 (p = 0.0003) when compared to cryoablation alone. This synergy was found to be dependent on CD3+ and CD8+ cells. Combining PD-1 blockade with cryoablation did not show a benefit over use of either treatment alone. Addition of ADT to anti-PD1 therapy and cryoablation doubled the time to accelerated growth in the untreated tumors (p = 0.0021) and extended survival when compared to cryoablation combined with ADT in 25% of the mice. Effects of combining anti-PD1 with ADT and cryoablation on mouse survival were obviated by T cell depletion.

Indeed, lower AR expression and attenuated AR signature activity is shown in CRPC tissues, especially in the subset of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) and prostate cancer stem-like cells (PCSCs). However, the significance of AR downregulation in androgen insensitivity and de-differentiation of tumor cells in CRPC is poorly understood and much neglected. Our previous study shows that the orphan nuclear receptor TLX (NR2E1), which is upregulated in prostate cancer, plays an oncogenic role in prostate carcinogenesis by suppressing oncogene-induced senescence. In the present study, we further established that TLX exhibited an increased expression in metastatic CRPC. Further analyses showed that overexpression of TLX could confer resistance to androgen deprivation and anti-androgen in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockdown of endogenous TLX could potentiate the sensitivity to androgen deprivation and anti-androgen in prostate cancer cells. Our study revealed that the TLX-induced resistance to androgen deprivation and anti-androgen was mediated through its direct suppression of AR gene transcription and signaling in both androgen-stimulated and -unstimulated prostate cancer cells. We also characterized that TLX could bind directly to AR promoter and repress AR transcription by recruitment of histone modifiers, including HDAC1, HDAC3, and LSD1. Together, our present study shows, for the first time, that TLX can contribute to androgen insensitivity in CRPC via repression of AR gene transcription and signaling, and also implicates that targeting the druggable TLX may have a potential therapeutic significance in CRPC management, particularly in NEPC and PCSCs.""","""['Lin Jia', 'Dinglan Wu', 'Yuliang Wang', 'Wenxing You', 'Zhu Wang', 'Lijia Xiao', 'Ganhui Cai', 'Zhenyu Xu', 'Chang Zou', 'Fei Wang', 'Jeremy Yuen-Chun Teoh', 'Chi-Fai Ng', 'Shan Yu', 'Franky L Chan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Nuclear receptor profiling in prostatospheroids and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Nuclear Receptor LRH-1 Functions to Promote Castration-Resistant Growth of Prostate Cancer via Its Promotion of Intratumoral Androgen Biosynthesis.', 'Reactivation of androgen receptor-regulated lipid biosynthesis drives the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Transcriptional repression by androgen receptor: roles in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The nuclear receptor TLX (NR2E1) inhibits growth and progression of triple- negative breast cancer.', 'Interaction between prostate cancer stem cells and bone microenvironment regulates prostate cancer bone metastasis and treatment resistance.', 'Towards understanding androgen receptor-independent prostate cancer: an evolving paradigm.', 'Glial PAMPering and DAMPening of Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.', 'The role of N-cadherin/c-Jun/NDRG1 axis in the progression of prostate cancer.']"""

We estimated site-specific incidence rates and survival for the most common cancers among Métis adults in Canada and compared these with rates among non-Aboriginal adults in Canada.  Methods:   We examined responses to the 1991 long-form census, including self-reported Métis ancestry linked to national mortality and cancer databases for followup from 1992 to 2009. We estimated age-standardized incidence rates and 5-year relative survival. We determined relative risk (RR) of cancer among Métis and non-Aboriginal adults using Poisson regression, and estimated excess mortality rate ratios using ethnicity-specific life tables.  Results:   For all cancers and both sexes combined, cancer incidence was similar for Métis and non-Aboriginal adults. However, incidence was significantly higher among Métis adults than among non-Aboriginal adults for the following cancers: female breast (RR 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.37), lung (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18-1.52), liver (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.30-3.38), larynx (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.03-2.48), gallbladder (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.12-4.96) and cervix (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.23-2.76). Métis people had poorer survival for prostate cancer (excess mortality rate ratio 2.60, 95% CI 1.52-4.46).  Interpretation:   We found higher incidence for several cancers and poorer survival after prostate cancer among Métis adults.

Novel therapeutic strategies to overcome this are urgently required. We evaluated how bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein inhibitors (BETi) abrogate aberrant AR signaling in CRPC.Experimental Design: We determined associations between BET expression, AR-driven transcription, and patient outcome; and the effect and mechanism by which chemical BETi (JQ1 and GSK1210151A; I-BET151) and BET family protein knockdown regulates AR-V7 expression and AR signaling in prostate cancer models.Results: Nuclear BRD4 protein expression increases significantly (P ≤ 0.01) with castration resistance in same patient treatment-naïve (median H-score; interquartile range: 100; 100-170) and CRPC (150; 110-200) biopsies, with higher expression at diagnosis associating with worse outcome (HR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.50-7.01; P ≤ 0.001). BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 RNA expression in CRPC biopsies correlates with AR-driven transcription (all P ≤ 0.001). Chemical BETi, and combined BET family protein knockdown, reduce AR-V7 expression and AR signaling. This was not recapitulated by C-MYC knockdown. In addition, we show that BETi regulates RNA processing thereby reducing alternative splicing and AR-V7 expression. Furthermore, BETi reduce growth of prostate cancer cells and patient-derived organoids with known AR mutations, AR amplification and AR-V7 expression. Finally, BETi, unlike enzalutamide, decreases persistent AR signaling and growth (P ≤ 0.001) of a patient-derived xenograft model of CRPC with AR amplification and AR-V7 expression.Conclusions: BETi merit clinical evaluation as inhibitors of AR splicing and function, with trials demonstrating their blockade in proof-of-mechanism pharmacodynamic studies.

We also found that the MORC2 expression level in high-grade cancer tissues was much more elevated and associated with unfavorable pathological characteristics, poor overall survival, and disease-free survival in several kinds of cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to predict the genes modulated by MORC2, and the results showed that dysregulation of MORC2 in tumor may take part in the cell cycle regulation and genomic instability. We observed that MORC2 knockdown would arrest the cell cycle progress, and the genome of tumors with high MORC2 expression contained more point mutations and gene copy number variation, which validates our gene set enrichment analysis results. The results also showed that MORC2 knockdown would significantly inhibit the proliferation, colony forming, migration, and invasion in multiple cancer cell lines.

With the development of molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), early diagnosis via non-invasive imaging has become possible. In this study, gadopentetic acid (GA)-doped silica (Gd@SiO2) was first synthesized by a reverse microemulsion method, and amino and carboxyl groups were then successively introduced onto the surface of this Gd@SiO2. After these steps, a monoclonal antibody (YPSMA-1) to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) was conjugated with carboxyl-modified Gd@SiO2 (Gd@SiO2-COOH) nanoparticles (NPs) by the carbodiimide method. Gd@SiO2-Ab NPs were thus obtained as specific MR contrast agents for PCa-targeted imaging. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the Gd@SiO2-Ab NPs exhibited a dispersed spherical morphology with a relatively uniform size distribution. The Gd@SiO2-Ab NPs showed high stability and high the longitudinal relaxation rate (r1). Cell-targeting experiments in vitro demonstrated the high potential of the synthesized NPs to target PSMA receptor-positive PCa cells. In vitro cytotoxicity assays showed that the Gd@SiO2-Ab NPs exhibited good biological safety. These results suggest that the synthesized Gd@SiO2-Ab NPs have great potential as specific MR contrast agents for PSMA receptor-positive PCa cells.""","""['Wei Jiang', 'Xiaojing He', 'Huiying Fang', 'Xue Zhou', 'Haitao Ran', 'Dajing Guo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['PEG-coated and Gd-loaded fluorescent silica nanoparticles for targeted prostate cancer magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescence imaging.', 'Improving Longitudinal Transversal Relaxation Of Gadolinium Chelate Using Silica Coating Magnetite Nanoparticles.', 'A novel one-step synthesis of Gd3+-incorporated mesoporous SiO2 nanoparticles for use as an efficient MRI contrast agent.', 'Gadolinium-incorporated mesoporous silica nanoparticles.', 'NIR-fluorescent dye doped silica nanoparticles for in vivo imaging, sensing and theranostic.', 'Fluorescently Labeled Gadolinium Ferrate/Trigadolinium Pentairon(III) Oxide Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Characterization, In Vivo Biodistribution, and Application for Visualization of Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.', 'Silica-Based Stimuli-Responsive Systems for Antitumor Drug Delivery and Controlled Release.', 'PEG-coated and Gd-loaded fluorescent silica nanoparticles for targeted prostate cancer magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescence imaging.']"""

Elevated expression of the transcription factor FoxM1 and c-Myc has been identified in prostate cancer. However, the potential mechanism of elevated FoxM1 and c-Myc to the development of prostate cancer has not been identified.  Methods:   In this report, the mRNA level of FoxM1 and c-Myc was detected in 30 prostate cancer and para-cancer tissues. Then, we detected the expression level of FoxM1 by real-time PCR and Western blot after disturbance of the expression level of c-Myc in PC-3 cells. Whether c-Myc could bind to FoxM1 promoter was identified by ChIP assay. Finally, the migratory, invasive, and proliferative abilities in FoxM1 overexpressing and silencing PC-3 cells were detected by wound healing, transwell assay, CCK-8 assays, and Ki-67 protein level.  Results:   We found that the expression level of FoxM1 and c-Myc were both increased in prostate cancer samples compared with para-cancer samples. The expression level of FoxM1 was changed consistent with the protein level of c-Myc. ChIP assay detected the direct binding of c-Myc in FoxM1 gene promoter. Lastly, overexpression of FoxM1 increased the migratory, invasive, and proliferative abilities of PC-3 cells, and its downregulation significantly decreased the migratory, invasive, and proliferative abilities.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, FoxM1 was significantly increased in prostate cancer samples, and it could regulate the proliferative and invasive ability of prostate cancer cells which might be a new target for prostate cancer. Besides, c-Myc could regulate the expression level of FoxM1 by directly binding to its gene promoter.""","""['Huafeng Pan', 'Yudi Zhu', 'Wei Wei', 'Siliang Shao', 'Xin Rui']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""World J Surg Oncol""","""['Tetramethylpyrazine inhibits prostate cancer progression by downregulation of forkhead box M1.', 'FOXM1 promotes the progression of prostate cancer by regulating PSA gene transcription.', 'microRNA-877-5p exerts tumor-suppressive functions in prostate cancer through repressing transcription of forkhead box M1.', 'Prognostic value of FOXM1 in solid tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'FoxM1: Repurposing an oncogene as a biomarker.', 'FOXM1: A small fox that makes more tracks for cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Heat shock proteins and cancer: The FoxM1 connection.', 'Forkhead Box Transcription Factors: Double-Edged Swords in Cancer.', 'A narrative review of research progress on FoxM1 in breast cancer carcinogenesis and therapeutics.', 'A Transcription Factor-Based Risk Model for Predicting the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer and Potential Therapeutic Drugs.']"""

Numerous studies have found that methylation of the RAR beta promoter contributed to the occurrence and development of malignant tumors. However, the connection between RAR beta promoter methylation and prostate cancer (PCa) remains unknown. This meta-analysis evaluated the clinical significance of RAR beta promoter methylation in PCa.  Materials and methods:   We searched all published records relevant to RAR beta and PCa in a series of databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science and CNKI. The rates of RAR beta promoter methylation in the PCa and control groups (including benign prostatic hyperplasia and normal prostate tissues) were summarized. In addition, we evaluated the source region of available samples and the methods used to detect methylation. To compare the incidence and variation in RAR beta promoter methylation in PCa and non-PCa tissues, the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated accordingly. All the data were analyzed with the statistical software STATA 12.0.  Results:   Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles assessing 1,339 samples were further analyzed. These data showed that the RAR beta promoter methylation rates in PCa tissues were significantly higher than the rates in the non-PCa group (OR=21.65, 95% CI: 9.27-50.57). Subgroup analysis according to the source region of samples showed that heterogeneity in Asia was small (I2=0.0%, P=0.430). Additional subgroup analysis based on the method used to detect RAR beta promoter methylation showed that the heterogeneity detected by MSP (methylation-specific PCR) was relatively small (I2=11.3%, P=0.343).  Conclusion:   Although studies reported different rates for RAR beta promoter methylation in PCa tissues, the total analysis demonstrated that RAR beta promoter methylation may be correlated with PCa carcinogenesis and that the RAR beta gene is particularly susceptible. Additional studies with sufficient data are essential to further evaluate the clinical features and prognostic utility of RAR beta promoter methylation in PCa.""","""['MengMeng Dou', 'XueLiang Zhou', 'ZhiRui Fan', 'XianFei Ding', 'LiFeng Li', 'ShuLing Wang', 'Wenhua Xue', 'Hui Wang', 'Zhenhe Suo', 'XiaoMing Deng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['Methylation of the retinoid response gene TIG1 in prostate cancer correlates with methylation of the retinoic acid receptor beta gene.', 'The association between histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and prostate cancer: relationship with clinicopathological parameters.', 'Altered methylation of multiple genes in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'The association of retinoic acid receptor beta2(RARβ2) methylation status and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A meta-analysis of the relationship between RARβ gene promoter methylation and non-small cell lung cancer.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Interleukin-30 suppresses IGF1 and CXCL5 and boosts SOCS3 reducing prostate cancer growth and mortality.', 'Association between HIC1 promoter methylation and solid tumor: A meta-analysis.', 'Promoter Methylation Status of the Retinoic Acid Receptor-Beta 2 Gene in Breast Cancer Patients: A Case Control Study and Systematic Review.', 'The Role of Nuclear Receptors in Prostate Cancer.', 'The miR-96 and RARγ signaling axis governs androgen signaling and prostate cancer progression.']"""

Methylene blue (MB) loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) with polydopamine coating (PDA) were employed as ""smart"" labels, while phytic acid doped polyaniline hydrogel (PANI) with high adsorption capacity was acted as substrate. In this strategy, amount of redox species (MB) encapsulated in MSN by PDA will be released under acidic condition and then absorbed stably by PANI. Meanwhile, the label tended to drop down due to the destruction of polydopamine coating and the disassociation of antibody-antigen composites. The advantages of as-prepared immunosensor are as follows: (1) Higher electron transfer efficiency was obtained because of the decrease of relative position between MB and the electrode; (2) Lower impedance was achieved due to the loss of the labels and the dissociation of antigen-antibody insulating layer; (3) Abundant MB molecules were loaded on MSN/PDA nanocarrier with large pore volume for signal amplification. Under optimum conditions, the proposed immunosensor exhibited a low detection limit of 1.25 fg mL-1 and a wide linear range from 10 fg mL-1 to 100 ng mL-1 for prostate specific antigen detection.

Combined local injections of dsRNA analogues (mimicking viral RNA) and repeated vaccinations with tumor-lysate loaded dendritic cells shows efficacy against colon cancer mouse models. In the context of immunotherapy, radiotherapy can exert beneficial abscopal effects.  Patients and methods:   In this two-cohort pilot phase I study, 15 advanced cancer patients received two 4-week cycles of four intradermal daily doses of monocyte-derived dendritic cells preloaded with autologous tumor lysate and matured for 24 h with poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), TNF-α and IFN-α. On days +8 and +10 of each cycle, patients received intratumoral image-guided 0.25 mg injections of the dsRNA-analogue Hiltonol. Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 was administered 1 week before. Six patients received stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) on selected tumor lesions, including those injected with Hiltonol. Expression of 25 immune-relevant genes was sequentially monitored by RT-PCR on circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) and serum concentrations of a cytokine panel were sequentially determined before and during treatment. Pre- and post-treatment PBMC from patients achieving durable stable disease (SD) were studied by IFNγ ELISPOT-assays responding to tumor-lysate loaded DC and by TCRβ sequencing.  Results:   Combined treatment was, safe and well tolerated. One heavily pretreated castration-resistant prostate cancer patient experienced a remarkable mixed abscopal response to SABR+ immunotherapy. No objective responses were observed, while nine patients presented SD (five of them in the six-patient radiotherapy cohort). Intratumoral Hiltonol increased IFN-β and IFN-α mRNA in circulating PBMC. DC vaccination increased serum IL-12 and IL-1β concentrations, especially in patients presenting SD. IFNγ-ELISPOT reactivity to tumor lysates was observed in two patients experiencing durable SD.

Objective:   To determine whether Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) ACO enrollment changes the appropriateness of screening for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers.  Design, setting, and participants:   For this population-based analysis of Medicare beneficiaries, we used Medicare data from 2007 through 2014 and evaluated changes in screening associated with ACO enrollment using differences-in-differences (DD) analyses. We then performed difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) analyses to determine whether observed changes in cancer screening associated with ACO enrollment were different across strata of appropriateness, defined using age (65-74 years vs ≥75 years) and predicted survival (top vs bottom quartile).  Main outcomes and measures:   Rates of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening measured yearly as a proportion of eligible Medicare beneficiaries undergoing relevant screening services.  Results:   Among Medicare beneficiaries, comprising 39 218 652 person-years before MSSP enrollment and 17 252 345 person-years after MSSP enrollment, breast cancer screening declined among both ACO (42.7% precontract, 38.1% postcontract) and non-ACO (37.3% precontract, 34.1% postcontract) populations. The adjusted rate of decline (DD) in the ACO population exceeded the non-ACO population by 0.79% (P < .001). This decline was most pronounced among elderly women (-2.1%), with minimal observed change among younger women (-0.26%). Baseline colorectal cancer screening rates were lower than those for breast cancer among both ACO (10.1% precontract, 10.3% postcontract) and non-ACO (9.2% precontract, 9.1% postcontract) populations. We observed an adjusted 0.24% (P = .03) increase in screening associated with ACO enrollment, most pronounced among younger Medicare beneficiaries (0.36%). For breast and colorectal cancer, we observed statistically significant differences in estimates of effect between age strata, suggesting that the ACO effect on cancer screening is mediated by age (DDD for both P < .001). Prostate cancer screening declined among ACO (35.1% precontract, 28.5% postcontract) and non-ACO (31.2% precontract, 25.7% postcontract) populations. The adjusted rate of decline in the ACO population exceeded that of the non-ACO population by 1.2%. We observed no difference in estimate of effect between age strata, suggesting that the ACO-mediated changes in prostate cancer screening are similar among younger and elderly men. Results characterizing appropriateness with predicted survival mirrored those when stratified by age.  Conclusions and relevance:   Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO enrollment is associated with more appropriate breast and colorectal screening, although the magnitude of the observed ACO effect is modest in the early ACO experience.""","""['Matthew J Resnick', 'Amy J Graves', 'Sunita Thapa', 'Robert Gambrel', 'Mark D Tyson', 'Daniel Lee', 'Melinda B Buntin', 'David F Penson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""JAMA Intern Med""","""['Accountability for Underuse and Overuse of Cancer Screening.', 'Re: Medicare Accountable Care Organization Enrollment and Appropriateness of Cancer Screening.', 'The association between Medicare accountable care organization enrollment and breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening.', 'Recommended Cancer Screening in Accountable Care Organizations: Trends in Colonoscopy and Mammography in the Medicare Shared Savings Program.', 'Changes in Postacute Care in the Medicare Shared Savings Program.', 'Changes in Low-Value Services in Year 1 of the Medicare Pioneer Accountable Care Organization Program.', 'Utility of polygenic risk scores in UK cancer screening: a modelling analysis.', 'Investigating the racial gap in prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen among younger men from 2012 to 2020.', 'The impact of Medicare shared savings program participation on hospital financial performance: An event-study analysis.', ""Primary care physicians' participation in the Medicare shared savings program and preventive services delivery: Evidence from the first 7\u2009years."", 'What Can Canada Learn From Accountable Care Organizations: A Comparative Policy Analysis.', 'The Effect of Network-Level Payment Models on Care Network Performance: A Scoping Review of the Empirical Literature.']"""

In fact, this issue can arise even in risk-factor studies nested within a randomized screening trial; even though the screening intervention is randomly allocated to trial arms, there is no randomization to potential risk-factors and uptake of screening can differ by risk-factor strata. Under the assumptions that neither screening nor the risk factor affects underlying incidence and no other forms of bias operate, we simulate and compare the underlying cumulative incidence and that observed in the study due to LTBCA. The example used will be constructed from the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial. The derived mathematical model is applied to simulating two nested studies to evaluate the potential for screening bias in observational lung cancer studies. Because of differential screening under plausible assumptions about preclinical incidence and duration, the simulations presented here show that LTBCA due to chest x-ray screening can significantly increase the estimated risk of lung cancer due to smoking by 1% and 50%. Traditional adjustment methods cannot account for this bias, as the influence screening has on observational study estimates involves events outside of the study observation window (enrollment and follow-up) that change eligibility for potential participants, thus biasing case ascertainment.""","""['Rick J Jansen', 'Bruce H Alexander', 'Richard B Hayes', 'Anthony B Miller', 'Sholom Wacholder', 'Timothy R Church']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Assessing contamination and compliance in the prostate component of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Conditions for Valid Empirical Estimates of Cancer Overdiagnosis in Randomized Trials and Population Studies.', 'Lung cancer risk prediction: Prostate, Lung, Colorectal And Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial models and validation.', 'Validation of Self-Report of Chest X-Ray Exam at a Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial Center.', 'The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial: Background, Goals, Organization, Operations, Results.']"""

Herein, we report the synthesis and in vitro activity of a pro-immunostimulant that exploits both processes in tandem to selectively confer cancer-mediated immunogenicity. We demonstrate that an imidazoquinoline pro-immunostimulant is inactive until it is selectively metabolized to an active immunostimulant by an endogenous α-mannosidase enzyme expressed within multidrug-resistant cancer cells. Following conversion, the immunostimulant is transported to the extracellular space via drug efflux, resulting in the activation of model bystander immune cells. Taken together, these results suggest that enzyme-directed immunostimulants can couple immunogenicity to these mechanisms of drug resistance. We name this process bystander-assisted immunotherapy, and envision that it could be advanced to treat drug-resistant diseases that rely on enzymatic degradation or drug efflux to persist.""","""['Anthony J Burt', 'Joseph D Hantho', 'Amy E Nielsen', 'Rock J Mancini']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochemistry""","""['Comparing the immunogenicity of glycosidase-directed resiquimod prodrugs mediated by cancer cell metabolism.', 'An Enzyme-Directed Imidazoquinoline for Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Novel tetrahydroisoquinolin-ethyl-phenylamine based multidrug resistance inhibitors with broad-spectrum modulating properties.', 'Multidrug resistance reversal agents.', 'Study on the effects of tetramethylpyrazine on tumor cells: survey and prospects.', 'Design and Characterization of Immune-Stimulating Imidazo4,5-cquinoline Antibody-Drug Conjugates.', 'Acquired Drug Resistance Enhances Imidazoquinoline Efflux by P-Glycoprotein.', 'Comparing the immunogenicity of glycosidase-directed resiquimod prodrugs mediated by cancer cell metabolism.']"""

However, comparative evidence is limited.  Methods:   In a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, we assigned men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who had not undergone biopsy previously to undergo MRI, with or without targeted biopsy, or standard transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy. Men in the MRI-targeted biopsy group underwent a targeted biopsy (without standard biopsy cores) if the MRI was suggestive of prostate cancer; men whose MRI results were not suggestive of prostate cancer were not offered biopsy. Standard biopsy was a 10-to-12-core, transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy. The primary outcome was the proportion of men who received a diagnosis of clinically significant cancer. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of men who received a diagnosis of clinically insignificant cancer.  Results:   A total of 500 men underwent randomization. In the MRI-targeted biopsy group, 71 of 252 men (28%) had MRI results that were not suggestive of prostate cancer, so they did not undergo biopsy. Clinically significant cancer was detected in 95 men (38%) in the MRI-targeted biopsy group, as compared with 64 of 248 (26%) in the standard-biopsy group (adjusted difference, 12 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4 to 20; P=0.005). MRI, with or without targeted biopsy, was noninferior to standard biopsy, and the 95% confidence interval indicated the superiority of this strategy over standard biopsy. Fewer men in the MRI-targeted biopsy group than in the standard-biopsy group received a diagnosis of clinically insignificant cancer (adjusted difference, -13 percentage points; 95% CI, -19 to -7; P<0.001).  Conclusions:   The use of risk assessment with MRI before biopsy and MRI-targeted biopsy was superior to standard transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy in men at clinical risk for prostate cancer who had not undergone biopsy previously.

Currently, there are no viable options available for the treatment of advanced-stage prostate cancer. Against this backdrop, the present study aimed to study the anticancer effect of panaxatriol against prostate DU-15 cancer cells.  Methods:   MTT cell viability assay evaluated the effects of the drug on cell cytotoxicity, while clonogenic assay was used to assess the effects on colony formation in DU-15 cells. Apoptotic effects were evaluated by DAPI staining using fluorescence microscopy. Effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were evaluated by flow cytometry using DCFH-DA and DiOC6. Effects on cell cycle were measured by flow cytometry, while cell migration tendency of the cells was evaluated by in vitro wound healing assay.  Results:   The results indicated that panaxatriol exerts dosedependent cytotoxic effects on prostate DU-15 cancer cells. The IC50 of panaxatriol was 30 μM. Panaxatriol was found to exert its anticancer activity through induction of apoptosis. The apoptosis of DU-15 cancer cells was prompted by ROSmediated alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, panaxatriol induced sub-G1 cell cycle arrest and suppressed the DU-15 cell migration ability in a concentration-dependent manner.  Conclusion:   Taken together, we strongly believe that panaxatriol may prove handy in the treatment and management of prostate cancer and deserves further research.""","""['Rong Yu', 'Yan Zhang', 'Ziqiang Xu', 'Jinjun Wang', 'Bicheng Chen', 'Hao Jin']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['Ouabain induces apoptotic cell death in human prostate DU 145 cancer cells through DNA damage and TRAIL pathways.', 'Ethyl acetate fraction from methanol extraction of Vitis thunbergii var. taiwaniana induced G0 /G1 phase arrest via inhibition of cyclins D and E and induction of apoptosis through caspase-dependent and -independent pathways in human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells.', 'Genistein induced anticancer effects on pancreatic cancer cell lines involves mitochondrial apoptosis, G0/G1cell cycle arrest and regulation of STAT3 signalling pathway.', 'Royleanone diterpenoid exhibits potent anticancer effects in LNCaP human prostate carcinoma cells by inducing mitochondrial mediated apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, suppression of cell migration and downregulation of mTOR/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.', 'Mitochondrial connection to ginsenosides.', 'Targeted-Lymphoma Drug Delivery System Based on the Sgc8-c Aptamer.', 'Ginsengenin derivatives synthesized from 20(R)-panaxotriol: Synthesis, characterization, and antitumor activity targeting HIF-1 pathway.', 'Anti-cancer effect and potential microRNAs targets of ginsenosides against breast cancer.', 'Lung carcinoma spheroids embedded in a microfluidic platform.', 'Multifloroside Suppressing Proliferation and Colony Formation, Inducing S Cell Cycle Arrest, ROS Production, and Increasing MMP in Human Epidermoid Carcinoma Cell Lines A431.']"""

Among them, PCAT3 and PCAT9 have been identified as two prostate tissue-specific lncRNAs and are up-regulated in PCa. However, their roles in the biological characteristics of PCa have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, our data revealed that knockdown of PCAT3 and PCAT9 suppressed cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis and stemness in androgen-dependent LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Strikingly, bioinformatics analysis predicted that both PCAT3 and PCAT9 transcripts had two conserved binding sties for miR-203. Meanwhile, dual luciferase report assays revealed that miR-203 could suppress the luciferase activities of reporter plasmids carrying the binding site of miR-203 on the mRNA of PCAT3 or PCAT9. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) showed that miR-203 mimic reduced the expression of PCAT3 and PCAT9 both in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. We also noted that both PCAT3 and PCAT9 inhibited miR-203 expression and alleviated repression on the expression of SNAI2, a critical regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition directly targeted by miR-203. Functionally, silence of miR-203 or ectopic expression of SNAI2 attenuated the inhibitory effect of PCAT3 and PCAT9 knockdown on cell proliferation and migration in vitro, and xenograft growth in vivo.

Noscapine is an antitussive opium alkaloid that showed antitumor activity against a variety of cancer while it has not exhibited severe side effects. This study investigates the anticancer activity of noscapine in combination with paclitaxel against two LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines. LNCaP and PC-3 cells were treated with noscapine or paclitaxel or combination. Cell viability was determined using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test. Apoptosis was assessed by acridine orange/ ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining. The mRNA expression of Bax, Bcl-2, AR, and PSA in the cellular response to treatments was investigated. MTT assay indicated the combination treatment of paclitaxel and noscapine significantly decreased viability compared to single-agent treatment and control groups. The results obtained with AO/EB double staining showed increased percentages of apoptotic cells in the presence of the combination of paclitaxel and noscapine. Furthermore, combinational treatment of paclitaxel and noscapine showed significant decrease in the mRNA expression of B-cell CLL/Lymphoma (Bcl-2) and increase in the mRNA expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax(, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in LNCaP and PC-3 cells (P<0.05.( The mRNA expression of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased in paclitaxel and noscapine combination-treated of LNCaP cells (P<0.05).

We reviewed patients who underwent TB followed by radical prostatectomy (RP). TB cores were evaluated for grade and tumor extent by 2 methods. In the IC method, the grade for each TB lesion was based on the core with the highest Gleason score. Tumor extent for each TB was based on the core with the highest percent of tumor involvement. In the AG method, the tumor from all cores within each TB lesion was aggregated to determine the final composite grade and percentage of tumor involvement. Each method was compared with MR lesional volume, MR lesional density (lesion volume/prostate volume), and RP. Fifty-five patients underwent TB followed by RP. Extent of tumor by the AG method showed a better correlation with target lesion volume (r= 0.27,P= .022) and lesional density (r = 0.32, P = .008) than did the IC method (r= 0.19 [P = .103] andr= 0.22 [P = .062]), respectively.

Information on employment status, monthly revenues and days of work missed due to sickness were assessed via online questionnaire. Additional data were retrieved from our institutional database. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were reported for continuous data. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to compare both surgical techniques for return to work time after RP.  Results:   Median time elapsed between surgery and return to work comprised 42 days in patients undergoing RARP (IQR: 21-70) and ORP (IQR: 28-84, P = 0.05). In Cox regression analysis, surgical approach showed no impact on return to work time (RARP vs. ORP hazard ratio = 1, 95% CI: 0.91-1.16, P = 0.69).

We analyzed the prognostic influence of PNI for a large institutional cohort of prostate cancer patients who underwent EBRT with and without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Material and methods:   We, retrospectively, reviewed prostate cancer patients treated with EBRT from 1993 to 2007 at our institution. The primary endpoint was biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), with secondary endpoints of metastasis-free survival (MFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for all survival endpoints. Hazard ratios for PNI were analyzed for the entire cohort and for subsets defined by NCCN risk level. Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for all survival endpoints after stratification by PNI status, with significant differences computed using the log-rank test.  Results:   Of 888 men included for analysis, PNI was present on biopsy specimens in 187 (21.1%). PNI was associated with clinical stage, pretreatment PSA level, biopsy Gleason score, and use of ADT (all P<0.01). Men with PNI experienced significantly inferior 10-year BFFS (40.0% vs. 57.8%, P = 0.002), 10-year MFS (79.7% vs. 89.0%, P = 0.001), and 10-year PCSS (90.9% vs. 95.9%, P = 0.009), but not 10-year OS (67.5% vs. 77.5%, P = 0.07). On multivariate analysis, PNI was independently associated with inferior BFFS (P<0.001), but not MFS, PCSS, or OS. In subset analysis, PNI was associated with inferior BFFS (P = 0.04) for high-risk patients and with both inferior BFFS (P = 0.01) and PCSS (P = 0.05) for low-risk patients. Biochemical failure occurred in 33% of low-risk men with PNI who did not receive ADT compared to 8% for low-risk men with PNI treated with ADT (P = 0.01).  Conclusion:   PNI was an independently significant predictor of adverse survival outcomes in this large institutional cohort, particularly for patients with NCCN low-risk disease. PNI should be carefully considered along with other standard prognostic factors when treating these patients with EBRT.

These indices of agreement are illustrated by application to a retrospective multireader study in which nine readers detected and scored prostate cancer lesions in 163 consecutive patients (n = 110 cases, n = 53 controls) using the guideline of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.  Results:   The proposed modified kappa, which properly corrects for the amount of agreement by chance, is shown to be approximately equivalent to the ISA. In the prostate cancer data, average kappa, modified kappa, and ISA equaled 30%, 55%, and 57%, respectively, for all lesions and 20%, 87%, and 87%, respectively, for index lesions.  Conclusions:   The application of kappa could result in a substantial downward bias in reader agreement on lesion detection when locations are not prespecified.

The aim of this research is to explore the lived experience of gay men with prostate cancer.  Method:   In-depth interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim from a purposive sample of eight gay men treated for prostate cancer in Ireland. A qualitative methodological approach employing Giorgi's descriptive phenomenological method was used to collect and analyse data.  Findings:   Three key aspects emerged representing the essence of the participants lived experience; The experience of diagnosis, treatment decision making, and the impact of treatment, with sub-themes of shock of diagnosis, the generalist nature of information, sexual side effects and incontinence, and masculinity and gay identity. Secondly, the experience of the healthcare service with sub-themes of sexual orientation disclosure and communication with the healthcare team; and thirdly, sources of support and means of coping which included significant others, family & friends, cancer support groups, and gay resources and support services.  Conclusion:   Gay men with prostate cancer have unmet information and supportive care needs throughout their prostate cancer journey, especially related to the impact of sexual dysfunction and associated rehabilitation, negatively impacting their quality of life.

In men, this type of cancer is the second most frequent type of cancer localized in the genitourinary system, after prostate cancer. The incidence of bladder cancer is ever growing and the etiopathogenic factors of bladder cancer are numerous and still not fully understood. Smoking is the most common risk factor incriminated in the onset of urinary tract cancer, the incidence of bladder cancer being directly connected to the smoking duration and the tobacco amount intake. Regarding the histopathological types, more than 90% of bladder cancer is represented by transitional cell carcinomas. Histopathology assessment of bladder cancer is a constant challenge regarding the connection between tumor grading, depth of invasion, extension and clinical prognosis. We evaluated here a number of 32 confirmed bladder tumors and we aimed to find common patterns of expression for markers like cytokeratin 7 (CK7), CK20, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD34, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2, 8 and 9, as well as for the Ki67 proliferation index. Our study showed that both CK7 and CK20 were present in different tumor areas and tumor gradings, MMP9 was more constantly expressed compared to the more variable expression of MMPs 2 and 8, vascular densities did not seem to increase in high-grade invasive tumors compared to low-grade tumors. Interestingly, while high Ki67 proliferating indexes were present especially in high-grade superficially tumors, compared to low-grade papillary tumors; this correlation was inversed for the advancing edges of the tumor. This common feature of invasive urothelial tumors will thus require further studies in order to elucidate the cellular signaling pathways by which these tumors increase their overall invasiveness.""","""['Mihai Lucian Ştefănescu', 'Florin Grosu', 'Lucian Eugen Stoica', 'Michael Schenker', 'Laurenţiu Mogoantă', 'Alexandra Eugenia Bastian']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Rom J Morphol Embryol""","""['Urachal carcinomas of the nonglandular type: salient features and considerations in pathologic diagnosis.', 'Alteration of the vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietins-1 and -2 pathways in transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder associated with tumor progression.', 'Prognostic significance in substaging ofT1 urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma on transurethral resection.', 'Comparison of the WHO/ISUP classification and cytokeratin 20 expression in predicting the behavior of low-grade papillary urothelial tumors.

Current therapies for NSCLC have only limited effect and treatment resistance develops rapidly. In a previous study, we have shown that C1-phenylethynyl tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) analogue 4 has anti-proliferative activity against PC3 human prostate cancer cells. However, this anticancer effect was achieved with relatively high IC50 in A549 lung cancer cells. To improve the potency of the drug, in the present study, a series of novel THIQ analogues (analogues 5a-d) were prepared by using an oxidative C-H functionalization strategy, and their potential anticancer activities on A549 lung cancer cells were investigated. Among these analogues, analogue 5c can markedly inhibit A549 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner with a reasonable IC50 of 14.61 ± 1.03 μM. This effect was mediated by analogue 5c-induced G0/G1 phase arrest and cell apoptosis. Treatment with analogue 5c was shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, reduction of glutathione, elevation of intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+), and activation of Caspase-3. Furthermore, analogue 5c can lead to DNA double-strand break and the activation of p53 pathway in A549 cells. In conclusion, the oxidative C-H functionalization strategy to generate analogue 5c could improve the drug anticancer efficacy by inducing mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in A549 cells.""","""['Xia Sun', 'Min Liu', 'Luyao Gao', 'Ying Mao', 'Diming Zhao', 'Jianfeng Zhuang', 'Lei Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['A novel fluorinated thiosemicarbazone derivative- 2-(3,4-difluorobenzylidene) hydrazinecarbothioamide induces apoptosis in human A549 lung cancer cells via ROS-mediated mitochondria-dependent pathway.', 'Design, synthesis and anticancer properties of novel oxa/azaspiro4,5trienones as potent apoptosis inducers through mitochondrial disruption.', 'Organometallic Gold(III) Complexes Similar to Tetrahydroisoquinoline Induce ER-Stress-Mediated Apoptosis and Pro-Death Autophagy in A549 Cancer Cells.', '1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) as privileged scaffold for anticancer de novo drug design.', 'Mitochondria: a promising target for anticancer alkaloids.', 'Protective effect of total saponins of ginseng stems and leaves (GSLS) on chlorpyrifos-induced brain toxicity in mice through the PTEN/PI3K/AKT axis.', 'In vitro Anticancer Activity of the Polar Fraction From the Lophocereus schottii Ethanolic Extract.', 'Arginine Deiminase Induces Immunogenic Cell Death and Is Enhanced by N-acetylcysteine in Murine MC38 Colorectal Cancer Cells and MDA-MB-231 Human Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro.', 'Synthesis and Antimicrobial Activity of Novel Piperidinyl Tetrahydrothieno2,3-cisoquinolines and Related Heterocycles.', 'Copper-catalyzed oxidative cross-dehydrogenative coupling of 2H-chromenes and terminal alkynes.']"""

Patient and methods:   We analysed the first 23 consecutive patients who underwent RASP using our 360° reconstruction between December 2015 and October 2017. After transperitoneal intravesical adenoma enucleation, a circumferential 360° reconstruction is performed. The first suture is placed at the 9 o'clock position and the edge of the urethra and bladder mucosa is approximated using 2-0 barbed suture. The reconstruction is continued counter-clockwise and the bladder mucosa is approximated to the urethra circumferentially.  Results:   The mean (sd) operating time was 160.6 (28.1) min and the estimated blood loss was 98.6 (99.8) mL. No patients required conversion to open surgery. No intra-operative or postoperative transfusions were needed. No intra-operative complications occurred. The mean (sd) length of hospital stay was 2.1 (0.6) days. One postoperative complication was reported (respiratory distress in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, requiring intensive care unit admission).  Conclusion:   Our 360° reconstruction during RASP is feasible and safe. The aim of the technique is to minimize use of electrocautery and decrease the raw surface area on the prostate capsule. This technical modification could potentially lessen postoperative bleeding after RASP and therefore the need for continuous bladder irrigation. In addition, it could potentially lead to mitigation of burning and irritative postoperative symptoms.

In addition, we analyzed the capability of high-resolution ultrasonography (hrUS), in vivo micro-CT (μCT), and 9.4T MRI to monitor tumor growth and the development of lymph node metastases.  Methods:   A total of 5 × 105 VCaP cells or 5 × 105 cells of LuCaP136- or LuCaP147 spheroids were injected into the prostate of male CB17-SCID mice (n = 8 for each cell type). During 12 weeks of follow-up, orthotopic tumor growth, and metastatic spread were monitored by repetitive serum-PSA measurements and imaging studies including hrUS, μCT, and 9.4T MRI. At autopsy, primary tumors and metastases were harvested and examined by histology and immunohistochemistry (CK5, CK8, AMACR, AR, Ki67, ERG, and PSA). From imaging results and PSA-measurements, tumor volume doubling time, tumor-specific growth rate, and PSA-density were calculated.  Results:   All 24 mice developed orthotopic tumors. The tumor growth could be reliably monitored by a combination of hrUS, μCT, MRI, and serum-PSA measurements. In most animals, lymph node metastases could be detected after 12 weeks, which could also be well visualized by hrUS, and MRI. Immunohistochemistry showed positive signals for CK8, AMACR, and AR in all xenograft types. CK5 was negative in VCaP- and focally positive in LuCaP136- and LuCaP147-xenografts. ERG was positive in VCaP- and negative in LuCaP136- and LuCaP147-xenografts. Tumor volume doubling times and tumor-specific growth rates were 21.2 days and 3.9 %/day for VCaP-, 27.6 days and 3.1 %/day for LuCaP136- and 16.2 days and 4.5 %/day for LuCaP147-xenografts, respectively.

The specific maleimide chemistry used for production of the maleimide-linked albumin drug (MAD) is critical, however, to minimize the plasma concentration of ""free"" cytotoxic drug spontaneously released from albumin carrier thus decreasing dose-limiting host toxicity while enhancing the plasma half-life from minutes to days (ie, pharmacokinetic effect) and tissue concentration of the MAD in the extracellular cellular fluid at sites of cancer (ie, EPR effect).  Methods:   To accomplish this goal, a chemical synthesis was developed using 2-fluoro-5-maleimidobenzoic acid to stably link the potent cytotoxic chemically modified analogue of the naturally occurring sesquiterpene γ-lactone, thapsigargin, 8-O-(12-aminododecanoyl)-8-O-debutanoyl thapsigargin (12ADT), to Cys-34 of albumin to produce 12ADT-MAD.  Results:   Using FITC-labeling, LC/MS analysis, and in vitro growth and clonogenic survival assays on a series of 6 human prostate cancer lines (LNCaP, LAPC-4, VCap, CWR22Rv 1, PC3, and Du145), we documented that 12ADT-MAD is endocytosed by prostate cancer cells where it is degraded into its amino acids liberating cysteinyl-maleimide-12ADT which is both chemically stable at the acidic pH of 5.5 present in the endosome while retaining its high killing ability (IC50 50 nM) via SERCA inhibition.

Adaptive survival pathways triggered by inhibition of driver genes in the androgen receptor (AR) or PI3K/AKT pathways are of great interest, since they are among the most frequently altered in castrate‐resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Unfortunately, negative feedback loops exist between the AR and PI3K/AKT pathways such that targeting AR leads to activation of PI3K/AKT signaling, while PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition leads to increased AR transcriptional activity. Hence, targeting both pathways provides an opportunity for conditional lethality and a high therapeutic index. In this issue of EMBO Molecular Medicine, Yan et al (2018) present an elegant study showing that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) acts as a common upstream activator of both AR and AKT signaling pathways, and use HDAC3 inhibitors as a monotherapy to co‐target two major pathways driving CRPC growth.""","""['Amina Zoubeidi', 'Martin E Gleave']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""EMBO Mol Med""","""['Dual inhibition of AKT-mTOR and AR signaling by targeting HDAC3 in PTEN- or SPOP-mutated prostate cancer.', 'Akt-regulated pathways in prostate cancer.', 'Signal transduction pathways in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in the treatment of prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'mTOR is a fine tuning molecule in CDK inhibitors-induced distinct cell death mechanisms via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Signaling Pathways That Control Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Novel Therapeutic Strategies for CDK4/6 Inhibitors in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Negative cross talk between LIMK2 and PTEN promotes castration resistant prostate cancer pathogenesis in cells and in vivo.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.']"""

PTEN loss increased macropinocytosis only in the context of AMPK activation, revealing a general requirement for AMPK in macropinocytosis and a novel mechanism by which AMPK promotes survival under stress. In prostate cancer cells, albumin uptake did not require macropinocytosis, but necrotic cell debris proved a specific macropinocytic cargo. Isotopic labeling confirmed that macropinocytosed necrotic cell proteins fueled new protein synthesis in prostate cancer cells. Supplementation with necrotic debris, but not albumin, also maintained lipid stores, suggesting that macropinocytosis can supply nutrients other than amino acids. Nontransformed prostatic epithelial cells were not macropinocytic, but patient-derived prostate cancer organoids and xenografts and autochthonous prostate tumors all exhibited constitutive macropinocytosis, and blocking macropinocytosis limited prostate tumor growth. Macropinocytosis of extracellular material by prostate cancer cells is a previously unappreciated tumor-microenvironment interaction that could be targeted therapeutically.Significance: As PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells proliferate in low-nutrient environments by scavenging necrotic debris and extracellular protein via macropinocytosis, blocking macropinocytosis by inhibiting AMPK, RAC1, or PI3K may have therapeutic value, particularly in necrotic tumors and in combination with therapies that cause nutrient stress.

Comprehending the pathobiology of invasion is required for developing efficacious targeted therapies against metastasis. Based on bioinformatics data, we predicted an association of melanoma differentiation-associated gene-9 [syntenin, or syndecan binding protein (SDCBP)] in prostate cancer progression. Using tissue samples from various Gleason stage prostate cancer patients with adjacent normal tissue, a series of normal prostate and prostate cancer cell lines (with differing tumorigenic/metastatic properties), mda-9/syntenin-manipulated variants (including loss-of-function and gain-of-function cell lines), and CRISPR/Cas9 stable MDA-9/Syntenin knockout cells, we now confirm the relevance of and dependence on MDA-9/syntenin in prostate cancer invasion. MDA-9/Syntenin physically interacted with insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor following treatment with insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP2), regulating downstream signaling processes that enabled STAT3 phosphorylation. This activation enhanced expression of MMP2 and MMP9, two established enzymes that positively regulate invasion. In addition, MDA-9/syntenin-mediated upregulation of proangiogenic factors including IGFBP2, IL6, IL8, and VEGFA also facilitated migration of prostate cancer cells. Collectively, our results draw attention to MDA-9/Syntenin as a positive regulator of prostate cancer metastasis, and the potential application of targeting this molecule to inhibit invasion and metastasis in prostate cancer and potentially other cancers.Significance: This study provides new mechanistic insight into the proinvasive role of MDA-9/Syntenin in prostate cancer and has potential for therapeutic application to prevent prostate cancer metastasis.

AR expression has also been reported in other solid tumors, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but its biological role here remains unclear. Through integrative analysis of a reverse phase protein array, we discovered increased expression of AR in an RCC patient-derived xenograft model of acquired resistance to the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKi) sunitinib. AR expression was increased in RCC cell lines with either acquired or intrinsic sunitinib resistance in vitro An AR signaling gene array profiler indicated elevated levels of AR target genes in sunitinib-resistant cells. Sunitinib-induced AR transcriptional activity was associated with increased phosphorylation of serine 81 (pS81) on AR. Additionally, AR overexpression resulted in acquired sunitinib resistance and the AR antagonist enzalutamide-induced AR degradation and attenuated AR downstream activity in sunitinib-resistant cells, also indicated by decreased secretion of human kallikrein 2. Enzalutamide-induced AR degradation was rescued by either proteasome inhibition or by knockdown of the AR ubiquitin ligase speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP). In vivo treatment with enzalutamide and sunitinib demonstrated that this combination efficiently induced tumor regression in a RCC model following acquired sunitinib resistance. Overall, our results suggest the potential role of AR as a target for therapeutic interventions, in combination with RTKi, to overcome drug resistance in RCC.Significance: These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting the androgen receptor to overcome RCC resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

The aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate the therapeutic effects of a synthetic analog of polygodial (PG), a pungent constituent abundantly present in mountain pepper, water pepper and dorrigo pepper, on LNCaP PCa cell line and its anti-cancer mechanisms in a preclinical study. We evaluated the anti-cancer potential of the PG analog namely DRP-27 using various assays such as cell viability by MTT assay, anchorage independent growth by soft agar assay, reactive oxygen species generation by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein probe-based fluorescence assay, and apoptosis by Annexin-V and TUNEL assays respectively. Western blot analysis was performed to identify the molecular mechanism of DRP-27-induced cell death. Our results showed that DRP-27 significantly inhibited LNCaP cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner at 48 h treatment in vitro. In addition, DRP-27 potently inhibited anchorage-independent growth of these cells. Flow cytometry, Annexin-V and TUNEL assays confirmed that DRP-27 induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells. DRP-27 also induced the activation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Western blot analysis revealed that DRP-27 downregulated the expression of survivin, while activating Bax and DNA damage marker pH2AX in LNCaP cells.

Materials and methods:   Analysis of a prospectively maintained database of 68 consecutive patients of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high-risk, very high-risk and node-positive adenocarcinoma prostate treated with SBRT was undertaken. All patients were treated with rotational intensity-modulated radiotherapy with daily image guidance. The dose delivered to the prostate and gross node was 35-37.5 Gy in 5 alternate day fractions. Node-positive patients received 25 Gy to pelvic nodal regions until the common iliac nodes. Treatment was delivered in 7-10 days. All patients received long-term androgen deprivation therapy (79% medical and 21% surgical).  Results:   Most patients (65%) had a Gleason score ≥ 8. The median prostate-specific antigen was 42. Twenty patients were high risk (30%), 11 (16%) very high risk and 37 (54%) node positive. No acute Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade ≥ 3 genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity was noted. Acute grade 2 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity were 12% and 3%, respectively. Late grade 3 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity was 3% and 0%, respectively. There was no increase in acute or late gastrointestinal toxicity with prophylactic pelvic nodal radiotherapy. Prior transurethral resection of prostate (n = 11) did not increase toxicity. At a median follow-up of 18 months, 97% patients were alive and 94% were biochemically controlled.  Conclusion:   SBRT is safe in the treatment of high-risk, very high-risk and node-positive prostate cancer, even with prophylactic pelvic radiotherapy or prior transurethral resection of prostate. Longer follow-up is required to determine efficacy.""","""['V Murthy', 'M Gupta', 'G Mulye', 'S Maulik', 'M Munshi', 'R Krishnatry', 'R Phurailatpam', 'R Mhatre', 'G Prakash', 'G Bakshi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Safety and Efficacy of Ultra-hypofractionation in Node-positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Moderately Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Node-positive Prostate Cancer.', 'Moderate Hypofractionation with Simultaneous Integrated Boost in Prostate Cancer: Long-term Results of a Phase I-II Study.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Overview of the current role of stereotactic body radiotherapy in the treatment of unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'A Prospective Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) with Concomitant Whole-Pelvic Radiotherapy (WPRT) for High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer Patients Using 1.5 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Guidance: The Preliminary Clinical Outcome.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy: Hitting Harder, Faster, and Smarter in High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Stereotactic Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Prostate Cancer in the Adjuvant or Salvage Setting: A Systematic Review.', 'SABR for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Multilevel MRI-Based Dose Escalation Trial.']"""

Materials and methods:   Texture analysis is performed in 12 treatment-naïve patients with 34 metastases before treatment and at one, two, and three months after the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Four first-order and 19 second-order statistical texture features are computed on the ADC maps in each lesion at every time point. Repeatability, inter-patient variability, and changes in the feature values under therapy are investigated. Spearman rank's correlation coefficients are calculated across time to demonstrate the relationship between the texture features and the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Results:   With few exceptions, the texture features exhibited moderate to high precision. At the same time, Friedman's tests revealed that all first-order and second-order statistical texture features changed significantly in response to therapy. Thereby, the majority of texture features showed significant changes in their values at all post-treatment time points relative to baseline. Bivariate analysis detected significant correlations between the great majority of texture features and the serum PSA levels. Thereby, three first-order and six second-order statistical features showed strong correlations with the serum PSA levels across time.

The added value of DCE MRI in combination with T2-weighted imaging and DWI is controversial (risks related to gadolinium administration, duration of MR exam, financial burden, effects on diagnostic performance). A comparison of a biparametric and a standard multiparametric MR imaging protocol, taking into account the different experience of the readers, may help to choose the best MR approach regarding diagnostic performance.  Purpose:   To determine the added value of dynamic contrasted-enhanced imaging (DCE) over T2-weighted imaging (T2-WI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer, and to evaluate how it affects the diagnostic performance of three readers with different grade of experience in prostate imaging.  Materials and methods:   Eighty-five patients underwent prostate MR examination at 1.5 T MR scanner performed because of elevated prostate-specific antigen level and/or suspicion of prostate cancer at digital rectal examination. Two MR images sets (Set 1 = biparametric, Set 2 = multiparametric) were retrospectively and independently scored by three radiologists with 7, 3 and 1 years of experience in prostate MR imaging respectively, according to PI-RADS v2. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated by dichotomizing reader scores. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed and areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated for each reader and image set. A comparison of ROC curves was performed to test the difference between the areas under the ROC curves among the three readers.  Results:   There was no significant difference regarding the detection of clinically significant tumor among the three readers between the two image sets. The AUC for the bi-parametric and multi-parametric MR imaging protocol was respectively 0.68-0.72 (Reader 1), 0.72-0.70 (Reader 2) and 0.60-0.54 (Reader 3). ROC curve comparison revealed no statistically significant differences for each protocol among the most experienced (Reader 1) and the other readers (Readers 2-3).  Conclusion:   The diagnostic accuracy of a bi-parametric MR imaging protocol consisting of T2-weighted imaging and DWI is comparable with that of a standard multi-parametric imaging protocol for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.

Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the usual noninvasive biomarker used for its detection. Its low specificity can increase the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies and the incidence of unpleasant complications for patients. The androgen-receptor gene (AR-CAG) repeat length and the percentage of promoter methylation (PPM) of genes glutathione-S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) and Ras association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) improve PCa detection. As an option for noninvasive assessment, we evaluated a combined analysis of all these biomarkers.  Patients and methods:   A total of 186 patients scheduled for biopsy were included in the present study. PSA and AR-CAG repeats were analyzed in blood samples. The PPM of GSTP1 and RASSF1A genes was estimated in prostate tissue and urinary sediment cells (USCs) and plasma DNA using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The predictive values for PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), logistic regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve, and decision curve analysis were used to assess the differential diagnosis.  Results:   Statistically significant differences between PCa and BPH patients were observed for all biomarkers, with higher positive and negative predictive values when all biomarkers were included in the analysis, attaining USC values of 89.2% and 78.0%, respectively. The differential diagnosis accuracy of PSA (area under the curve, 0.59) increased to 0.70 and 0.68, respectively, when the combined analysis of PPM of RASSF1Aplasma or GSTP1AUSC and AR-CAG repeats was performed. Decision curve analysis showed the utility of the combined analysis to decrease the number of unnecessary biopsies.  Conclusion:   The results showed that combined analysis of the proposed biomarkers in plasma and USCs significantly increased the confidence for the differential diagnosis for PCa and BPH. This noninvasive practice might help in the early detection of PCa and patient follow-up, avoiding to some extent unnecessary prostate biopsies.""","""['Beatriz E Sánchez', 'Adolfo Aguayo', 'Braulio Martínez', 'Fabiola Rodríguez', 'Melanie Marmolejo', 'Yevgeniya Svyryd', 'Leonora Luna', 'Luis A Muñoz', 'Miguel A Jiménez', 'Mariano Sotomayor', 'Florencia Vargas V', 'Osvaldo M Mutchinick']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Molecular Diagnostic of Prostate Cancer From Body Fluids Using Methylation-Specific PCR (MS-PCR) Method.', 'Risk score predicts high-grade prostate cancer in DNA-methylation positive, histopathologically negative biopsies.', 'Combined hypermethylation of APC and GSTP1 as a molecular marker for prostate cancer: quantitative pyrosequencing analysis.', 'Proteomics in diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical utility of current biomarkers for prostate cancer detection.', 'Glutathione-S-Transferase p1 Gene Promoter Methylation in Cell-Free DNA as a Diagnostic and Prognostic Tool for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Cancer-specific mortality after radical prostatectomy vs external beam radiotherapy in high-risk Hispanic/Latino prostate cancer patients.', 'Biomarkers That Differentiate Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia from Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'The Effect of Hormone Therapy on the Expression of Prostate Cancer and Multi-Epigenetic Marker Genes in a Population of Iranian Patients.', 'DNA Methylation-Based Testing in Liquid Biopsies as Detection and Prognostic Biomarkers for the Four Major Cancer Types.']"""

To describe long-term oncological outcomes of BCR patients and to analyze risk factors for further outcomes in these men with a special focus on RP-BCR time.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the data of 5509 RP patients treated between 1992 and 2006. Of those, we included 1321 patients who experienced BCR (PSA level ≥0.2 ng/mL) and did not receive any neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy.

MP was recorded in 177 (13.4%), PCSM in 126 (9.5%), and overall mortality (OM) in 264 (20.0%) patients. Patients with MP had worse tumor characteristics such as higher Gleason Scores (GS), rapid PSA doubling-time (DT), and shorter RP-BCR time intervals.

Usually, CAD systems automatically highlight cancer-suspicious regions to the radiologist, reducing reader variability and interpretation errors. Nevertheless, implementing this software requires the selection of which mp-MRI parameters can best discriminate between malignant and non-malignant regions. To exploit functional information, some parameters are derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) acquisitions. In particular, much CAD software employs pharmacokinetic features, such as K trans and k ep, derived from the Tofts model, to estimate a likelihood map of malignancy. However, non-pharmacokinetic models can be also used to describe DCE-MRI curves, without any requirement for prior knowledge or measurement of the arterial input function, which could potentially lead to large errors in parameter estimation. In this work, we implemented an empirical function derived from the phenomenological universalities (PUN) class to fit DCE-MRI. The parameters of the PUN model are used in combination with T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted acquisitions to feed a support vector machine classifier to produce a voxel-wise malignancy likelihood map of the prostate. The results were all compared to those for a CAD system based on Tofts pharmacokinetic features to describe DCE-MRI curves, using different quality aspects of image segmentation, while also evaluating the number and size of false positive (FP) candidate regions. This study included 61 patients with 70 biopsy-proven prostate cancers (PCa). The metrics used to evaluate segmentation quality between the two CAD systems were not statistically different, although the PUN-based CAD reported a lower number of FP, with reduced size compared to the Tofts-based CAD. In conclusion, the CAD software based on PUN parameters is a feasible means with which to detect PCa, without affecting segmentation quality, and hence it could be successfully applied in clinical settings, improving the automated diagnosis process and reducing computational complexity.""","""['S Mazzetti', 'V Giannini', 'F Russo', 'D Regge']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Comparison between PUN and Tofts models in the quantification of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging.', 'A fully automatic computer aided diagnosis system for peripheral zone prostate cancer detection using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Prostate cancer detection on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: computer-aided diagnosis versus single perfusion parameter maps.', 'Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and pharmacokinetic models in prostate cancer.', 'Overview of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'Multi-resolution super learner for voxel-wise classification of prostate cancer using multi-parametric MRI.', 'A Fully Automatic Artificial Intelligence System Able to Detect and Characterize Prostate Cancer Using Multiparametric MRI: Multicenter and Multi-Scanner Validation.', 'Computer-Aided Diagnosis Improves the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer on Multiparametric-MRI: A Multi-Observer Performance Study Involving Inexperienced Readers.']"""

In our study, we assessed the relationship between the number of sexual partners, age of first sexual experience and age of first masturbation and prostate cancer incidence.  Materials and methods:   In Ordu University Department of Urology between January 2013 and September 2016, in PSA elevation and rectal examination, patients with prostate biopsy were evaluated due to nodule palpation in the prostate. At younger ages and at present, their first masturbation ages, first sexual debut ages, and total sexual partner numbers were recorded. The correlation between the obtained data and PCa frequency was evaluated.  Results:   The study included 146 patients with PCa identified on biopsy and 171 patients with benign biopsy results who answered the questions. 66.7% of the ones whose biopsy results were benign and 40.6% of cancer suspects had only one sexual partner. The median number of sexual partners was 1±4 (1-100) in the benign group and 2±6 (1-500) in the malignant group (p=0.039).

Materials and methods:   Patients with clinically localized PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and had preoperative mp-MRI between May-2011 and December-2013. Mp-MRI was evaluated according to the European Society of Urogenital Radiology MRI prostate guidelines by two different readers. Histopathological RP results were the standard reference.  Results:   79 patients were included; mean age was 61 and median preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 7.0. On MRI, 28% patients had ECE evidenced in the mp-MRI, 5% seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and 4% lymph node involvement (LNI). At RP, 39.2% had ECE, 26.6% SVI and 12.8% LNI. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of mp-MRI for ECE were 54.9%, 90.9%, 76%, 81% and 74.1% respectively; for SVI values were 19.1%, 100%, 77.3%, 100% and 76.1% respectively and for LNI 20%, 98.4%, 86.7%, 66.7% and 88.7%.  Conclusions:   Major surgical decisions are made with digital rectal exam (DRE) and ultrasound studies before the use of Mp-MRI. This imaging study contributes to rule out gross extraprostatic extension (ECE, SVI, LNI) without competing with pathological studies. The specificity and NPV are reasonable to decide surgical approach.

Combining these two methods, we developed tandem labeling and double labeling strategies that permit the detection of unsialylated and sialylated glycans or the detection of O- and N-linked glycans on the same tissue section, respectively. We applied these methods to screen murine tissue specimens, human multiple-organ cancer arrays, and lymphoma and prostate cancer arrays. Using tandem labeling with ST6Gal1 to analyze N-glycans in a prostate cancer array, we found striking differences in expression patterns of both sialylated and unsialylated N-glycans between cancerous and healthy samples. Such differences were also observed between normal tissue from healthy donors and healthy tissue adjacent to tumors. Our double labeling technique identified significant differences in unsialylated O-glycans between B-cell and T-cell lymphomas and between B-cell lymphomas and normal adjacent lymph nodes.

In our study, we investigated whether FASN inhibition using orlistat is an effective adjunctive treatment for ovarian cancers that have become platinum resistant using a cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumour xenograft model in mice. Mice were treated with orlistat or cisplatin or a combination and metabolite analysis and histopathology were performed on the tumours ex vivo. Orlistat decreased tumour fatty acid metabolism by inhibiting FASN, cisplatin reduced fatty acid β-oxidation, and combination treatment delayed tumour growth and induced apoptotic and necrotic cell death in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells over and above that with either treatment alone.

Hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), driven by hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), is involved in cancer progression and metastasis. The present study was designed to explore the role of propofol in hypoxia-induced resistance of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel. We used the Cell Counting Kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay to measure cell viability and cell proliferation, respectively, in prostate cancer cell lines. Then, we detected HIF-1α, E-cadherin, and vimentin expression using western blotting. Propofol reversed the hypoxia-induced docetaxel resistance in the prostate cancer cell lines. Propofol not only decreased hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression, but also reversed hypoxia-induced EMT by suppressing HIF-1α. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of HIF-1α reversed the hypoxia-induced docetaxel resistance, although there was little change in docetaxel sensitivity between the hypoxia group and propofol group. The induction of hypoxia did not affect E-cadherin and vimentin expression, and under the siRNA knockdown conditions, the effects of propofol were obviated. These data support a role for propofol in regulating EMT in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that propofol plays an important role in hypoxia-induced docetaxel sensitivity and EMT in prostate cancer cells and that it is a potential drug for overcoming drug resistance in prostate cancer cells via HIF-1α suppression.""","""['Jiang Qian', 'Sheliang Shen', 'Wei Chen', 'Nianping Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['A ROS/STAT3/HIF-1α signaling cascade mediates EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'Prostate cancer cell malignancy via modulation of HIF-1α pathway with isoflurane and propofol alone and in combination.', 'Tumor microenvironment and epithelial mesenchymal transition as targets to overcome tumor multidrug resistance.', 'The role of hypoxia on prostate cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha: Implications of Anesthesia on Cancers.', 'Propofol Regulates ER Stress to Inhibit Tumour Growth and Sensitize Osteosarcoma to Doxorubicin.', 'An intravenous anesthetic drug-propofol, influences the biological characteristics of malignant tumors and reshapes the tumor microenvironment: A narrative literature review.', 'Anesthetic propofol enhances cisplatin-sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells through N6-methyladenosine-dependently regulating the miR-486-5p/RAP1-NF-κB axis.', 'Pancreatic Cancer and Microenvironments: Implications of Anesthesia.']"""

The top 11 miRNAs with significantly higher level in ExoHypoxic compared to ExoNormoxic were miR-517a, miR-204, miR-885, miR-143, miR-335, miR-127, miR-542, miR-433, miR-451, miR-92a and miR-181a; and top nine miRNA with significantly lower expression level in ExoHypoxic compared to ExoNormoxic were miR-521, miR-27a, miR-324, miR-579, miR-502, miR-222, miR-135b, miR-146a and miR-491. Importantly, the two differentially expressed miRNAs miR-885 (increased expression) and miR-521 (decreased expression) showed similar expression pattern in exosomes isolated from the serum of PCa patients compared to healthy individuals. Additionally, miR-204 and miR-222 displayed correlated expression patterns in prostate tumors (Pearson R = 0.66, p < 0.0001) by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) genomic dataset analysis. Overall, the present study identified unique miRNAs with differential expression in exosomes secreted from hypoxic PCa cells and suggests their potential usefulness as a biomarker of hypoxia in PCa patients.""","""['Gati K Panigrahi', 'Anand Ramteke', 'Diane Birks', 'Hamdy E Abouzeid Ali', 'Sujatha Venkataraman', 'Chapla Agarwal', 'Rajeev Vibhakar', 'Lance D Miller', 'Rajesh Agarwal', 'Zakaria Y Abd Elmageed', 'Gagan Deep']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Exosomes secreted under hypoxia enhance invasiveness and stemness of prostate cancer cells by targeting adherens junction molecules.', 'Exosomes secreted by prostate cancer cells under hypoxia promote matrix metalloproteinases activity at pre-metastatic niches.', 'Differential expression and release of exosomal miRNAs by human islets under inflammatory and hypoxic stress.', 'Circulating exosomal microRNAs as emerging non-invasive clinical biomarkers in heart failure: Mega bio-roles of a nano bio-particle.', 'Exosomes promote bone marrow angiogenesis in hematologic neoplasia: the role of hypoxia.', 'Dynamic Role of Exosome microRNAs in Cancer Cell Signaling and Their Emerging Role as Noninvasive Biomarkers.', 'Combination of Urinary MiR-501 and MiR-335 With Current Clinical Diagnostic Parameters as Potential Predictive Factors of Prostate Biopsy Outcome.', 'Small extracellular vesicles as a multicomponent biomarker platform in urinary tract carcinomas.', 'The Immunomodulatory Role of Hypoxic Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles.', 'Hypoxia Induced Changes of Exosome Cargo and Subsequent Biological Effects.']"""

In this study, we investigated the effects of the angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2R) agonist Compound 21 (C21), which is expected to play similar roles to an ARB, on prostate carcinogenesis using the transgenic rat for adenocarcinoma of prostate (TRAP) model previously established in our laboratory. In vitro analyses of the cell growth, Western blotting and reporter gene assays were performed using LNCaP cells. TRAP rats at 6 weeks of age were randomly divided into 3 groups of 12 animals each and treated with C21 at 1 or 2 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 12 weeks. C21 reduced the proliferation activity of prostate cancer cells and down-regulated the PSA promoter activity and the AR protein expression. We discovered that C21 inhibited the progression of prostate carcinogenesis in TRAP rats and decreased the incidence of adenocarcinoma in the lateral prostate. A significant increase in the apoptotic index with activation of caspase 3 and 7 were observed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analyses. C21 also down-regulated the expression of AR significantly in TRAP rat prostate. C21 decreased the expression of AR and reduced the proliferation activity effectively in prostate cancer cells and TRAP rat prostate. These findings suggest that AT2R agonist may be a candidate novel chemopreventive agent against human prostate cancer.""","""['Yusuke Ito', 'Aya Naiki-Ito', 'Hiroyuki Kato', 'Shugo Suzuki', 'Toshiya Kuno', 'Yukari Ishiguro', 'Satoru Takahashi', 'Hiroji Uemura']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Therapeutic targeting of angiotensin II receptor type 1 to regulate androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Expression and role of the angiotensin II AT2 receptor in human prostate tissue: in search of a new therapeutic option for prostate cancer.', 'Ellagic acid, a component of pomegranate fruit juice, suppresses androgen-dependent prostate carcinogenesis via induction of apoptosis.', 'Down-Regulation of prostate-specific antigen expression by ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in human prostate cancer.', 'Pioglitazone, a Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ Agonist, Suppresses Rat Prostate Carcinogenesis.', 'The AT1/AT2 Receptor Equilibrium Is a Cornerstone of the Regulation of the Renin Angiotensin System beyond the Cardiovascular System.', 'Metabolic pathways enriched according to ERG status are associated with biochemical recurrence in Hispanic/Latino patients with prostate cancer.', 'The Angiotensin AT2 Receptor: From a Binding Site to a Novel Therapeutic Target.', 'The Effect of Local Renin Angiotensin System in the Common Types of Cancer.', 'Suppressive Effect and Molecular Mechanism of Houttuynia cordata Thunb.

Performing a high-throughput screening of a large collection of human microRNA mimics, we identified miR-149-3p as a negative post-transcriptional modulator of DAB2IP. By efficiently downregulating DAB2IP, this miRNA enhances cancer cell motility and invasiveness, facilitating activation of NF-kB signaling and promoting expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors. In addition, we found that miR-149-3p secreted by prostate cancer cells induces DAB2IP downregulation in recipient vascular endothelial cells, stimulating their proliferation and motility, thus potentially remodeling the tumor microenvironment. Finally, we found that inhibition of endogenous miR-149-3p restores DAB2IP activity and efficiently reduces tumor growth and dissemination of malignant cells.

Studies of nm23H1 have been done in many other malignancies. But none of these studies took up nm23H1 gene as predictor in the metastases of prostatic carcinoma.  Aims and objectives:   To study the expression of nm23H1 in prostatic lesion and to correlate nm23H1 expression with presence of metastases, tumour stage, tumour grade and with PSA level serum.  Setting and design:   Tertiary hospital based retrospective and prospective study done in a period of one year from thirty patients having prostatic lesion confirmed by biopsy.  Material and methods:   Immunohistochemistry for nm23H1 was performed on unstained coated sections of prostatic lesions to study the relation with prostatic lesion and their correlation with age, PSA level, tumour stage, grading. Clinical data was collected from medical records.  Statistical analysis:   SPSS Version 15 analysis software was used. The value were presented in number(%) and Mean ± SD.  Results:   Majority of patients belong to age group 61 to 70yrs.Gleason score >7 were seen in 55% of patients of adenocarcinoma with and without metastasis. The difference in PSA levels between BPH and adenocarcinoma was significant (P < 0.001). IHC expression for nm23H1 gene showed positive findings in all the cases (P = 1). PSA values >20ng/ml showed maximum % mean expression (98.64%) as compared to PSA levels <10 ng/ml (96.91%).

Materials and methods:   We used linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data to identify patients aged 66-99 years who were diagnosed with one of the following 10 cancers: prostate, bladder, esophageal, pancreatic, lung, liver, kidney, colorectal, breast, or ovarian, from 2007 through 2012. We attributed payments for each patient to a phase of care (i.e., initial, continuing, or end of life), based on time from diagnosis until death or end of study interval. We summed payments for all claims attributable to the primary cancer diagnosis and analyzed the overall and phase-based costs and then by differing demographics, cancer stage, geographic region, and year of diagnosis.  Results:   We identified 428,300 patients diagnosed with one of the 10 malignancies. Annual payments were generally highest during the initial phase. Mean expenditures across cancers were $14,381 during the initial phase, $2,471 for continuing, and $13,458 at end of life. Payments decreased with increasing age. Black patients had higher payments for four of five cancers with statistically significant differences. Stage III cancers posed the greatest annual cost burden for four cancer types. Overall payments were stable across geographic region and year.  Conclusion:   Considerable differences exist in expenditures across phases of cancer care. By understanding the drivers of such payment variations across patient and tumor characteristics, we can inform efforts to decrease payments and increase quality, thereby reducing the burden of cancer care.  Implications for practice:   Considerable differences exist in expenditures across phases of cancer care. There are further differences by varying patient characteristics. Understanding the drivers of such payment variations across patient and tumor characteristics can inform efforts to decrease costs and increase quality, thereby reducing the burden of cancer care.""","""['Deborah R Kaye', 'Hye Sung Min', 'Lindsey A Herrel', 'James M Dupree', 'Chad Ellimoottil', 'David C Miller']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['System-Level Health-Care Integration and the Costs of Cancer Care Across the Disease Continuum.', 'Medicare payments from diagnosis to death for elderly cancer patients by stage at diagnosis.', 'Evaluation of trends in the cost of initial cancer treatment.', 'Costs of cancer along the care continuum: What we can expect based on recent literature.', 'Costs of cancer care in the USA: a descriptive review.', 'Geographical Disparities in Esophageal Cancer Incidence and Mortality in the United States.', 'Treatment patterns and out-of-hospital healthcare resource utilisation by patients with advanced cancer living with pain: An analysis from the Stop Cancer PAIN trial.', 'Renal cell carcinoma: the population, real world, and cost-of-illness.', 'Cancer-related costs, the resulting financial impact and coping strategies among cancer survivors living in a setting with a pluralistic health system: a qualitative study.', 'Treatment Costs of Colorectal Cancer by Sex and Age: Population-Based Study on Health Insurance Data from Germany.']"""

However, the effect of CO on prostate cancer has not been demonstrated. Therefore, we analyzed the antitumor activities and related mechanisms of CO on prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Cell viability of LNCaP and PC-3 cells after CORM-2 treatment was measured by CCK-8 assay, whereas the ATP production were detected by ATP detection assay. The early apoptosis induced by CO was evaluated by flow cytometry, and the expression level of apoptosis-related molecules (Caspases 3, 8, 9 and cleaved-Caspases 3, 8, 9) was detected using Western blot. Matrigel in vitro invasion assay was used to evaluate the effect of CO on cell invasion. We then evaluated the impact of CO on the expression of several key regulators involved in the LKB1 signaling pathway. At last, xenograft tumor in nude mice was used to further investigate the antitumor effect of CO in vivo.  Results:   Our results showed that CO could significantly inhibit proliferation and invasion, and induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer cell lines. The expression of LKB1 could be up-regulated after CO treatment, and CO also could increase p-AMPK levels and decrease p-mTOR. Furthermore, LKB1 knockdown could weaken the effect of CO on prostate cancer cells. In vivo, CO treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth and induced apoptosis in xenografts tumor in nude mice.

Nevertheless, the clinical utility of negative mpMRI (nMRI) is less clear.  Objective:   To assess outcomes of men with nMRI and clinical follow-up after 7 yr of activity at a reference center.  Design, setting, and participants:   All mpMRI performed from January 2010 to May 2015 were reviewed. We selected all patients with nMRI and divided them in group A (naïve patients) and group B (previous negative biopsy). All patients without a diagnosis of PCa had a minimum follow-up of 2 yr and at least two consecutive nMRI. Patients with positive mpMRI were also identified to assess their biopsy outcomes.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess both any-grade PCa and csPCa diagnosis-free survival probabilities. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models were fitted to identify predictors of csPCa diagnosis.  Results and limitations:   We identified 1545 men with nMRI, and 1255 of them satisfied the inclusion criteria; 659 belonged to group A and 596 to group B. Any-grade PCa and csPCa diagnosis-free survival probabilities after 2 yr of follow-up were 94% and 95%, respectively, in group A; in group B, they were 96%. After 48 mo of follow-up, any-grade PCa diagnosis-free survival probability was 84% in group A and 96% in group B (log rank p<0.001). Diagnosis-free survival probability for csPCa was unchanged after 48 mo of follow-up. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, increasing age (p=0.005) was an independent predictor of lower csPCa diagnosis probability, while increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA density (<0.001) independently predicted higher csPCa diagnosis probability. The prevalence of and positive predictive value for csPCa were 31.6% and 45.5%, respectively. Limitations include limited follow-up and the inability to calculate true csPCa prevalence in the study population.  Conclusions:   mpMRI is highly reliable to exclude csPCa. Nevertheless, systematic biopsy should be recommended even after nMRI, especially in younger patients with high or raising PSA levels.  Patient summary:   It is a matter of debate whether patients with negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate could obviate the need to perform a systematic biopsy. In this report, we looked at the outcomes of patients with negative mpMRI and midterm clinical follow-up at a reference center.

Methods:   We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of four antibiotic prophylaxis strategies: ciprofloxacin alone, ceftriaxone alone, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone in combination, and directed prophylaxis selection based on susceptibility testing. We used a payer's perspective and estimated the health care costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with each strategy for a cohort of 66-year-old men undergoing TRPB. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Base-case resistance prevalence was 29% to ciprofloxacin and 7% to ceftriaxone, reflecting susceptibility patterns observed at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Resistance levels were varied in sensitivity analysis.  Results:   In the base case, single-agent prophylaxis strategies were dominated. Directed prophylaxis strategy was the optimal strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained. Relative to the directed prophylaxis strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the combination strategy was $123,333/QALY gained over the lifetime time horizon.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using claims data. PC patients with bone metastasis were identified in the MarketScan Databases between January 1, 2004, and March 1, 2014. The propensity score matching approach was used to match patients with SREs to those without SREs. A pseudo-SRE date was assigned to the control group. We compared 6-month and 12-month total costs of patients between two groups after the SRE or pseudo-SRE date. All costs were adjusted to 2014 US$.  Results:   We identified 4083 PC men with bone metastasis, from which 787 patients with SREs were matched (1:1) to those without SREs. On average, the total 6-month cost of treating patients with SREs was $43,746 compared with $25,956 in the matched control cohort (P < 0.05). The largest proportion of differences in costs between the two groups was incurred in the first month after the SRE index date or the pseudo-SRE date ($14,979 vs. $4,849; P < 0.05) and was mostly attributable to outpatient visits (43.4%; P < 0.05) and inpatient hospitalization (33.1%; P < 0.05). The total cost per patient over the 12-month period was $22,171 higher among patients with SREs than among patients without SREs (P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that SREs impose considerable burden on health resource utilization for payers. Costs attributable to SREs were substantial. Most costs were incurred in the first month after the occurrence of SREs. Although costs decreased thereafter, they remained significantly higher for patients with SREs in subsequent months compared with patients without SREs.""","""['Yue Zhong', 'Adriana Valderrama', 'Jianying Yao', 'Prina Donga', 'Pinar Bilir', 'Peter J Neumann']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Value Health""","""['Economic evaluation of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'The economic burden of skeletal-related events among elderly men with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Impact of skeletal complications on total medical care costs among patients with bone metastases of lung cancer.', 'Clinical and economic burden of bone metastasis and skeletal-related events in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical, economic and humanistic burdens of skeletal-related events associated with bone metastases.', 'Nomograms predict survival benefits of radical prostatectomy and chemotherapy for prostate cancer with bone metastases: A SEER-based study.', 'State-of-the-art imaging for diagnosis of metastatic bone disease.', 'Costs and Healthcare Resource Utilization Associated with Hospital Admissions of Patients with Metastatic or Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

Hence, we examined whether midlife diabetes is related to the risk of cancer in late-life, and whether genetic and early-life environmental factors play a role in this association. This study included 25,154 twin individuals born in 1958 or earlier from the Swedish Twin Registry. Information on cancer diagnosis in late life (aged ≥ 65) during 1998-2014, was derived from the National Patient and Cancer Registries. Diabetes was ascertained based on self- or informant-reported history, patient registry and antidiabetic medication use. Midlife diabetes was defined when diabetes was diagnosed before 65 years. Data were analyzed following two strategies: (i) unmatched case-control analysis for all participants using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, and (ii) co-twin control analysis for cancer-discordant twin pairs using conditional logistic regression. Overall, 1,766 (7.0%) had midlife diabetes and 5,293 (21.0%) had cancer in late-life. In multiadjusted GEE models, the odds ratios (95% CIs) of diabetes were 10.55 (2.95-37.67) for pharynx cancer, 5.78 (1.72-19.40) for small intestine cancer, 2.37 (1.14-4.91) for liver cancer and 0.48 (0.35-0.67) for prostate cancer. In people with diabetes, diabetes duration was dose-dependently associated with cancer risk. In conditional logistic regression analysis of 176 prostate cancer-discordant twin pairs, the association between midlife diabetes and prostate cancer in later life became stronger. Midlife diabetes increases the risk of pharynx, small intestine and liver cancers, but reduces prostate cancer risk in late life. Genetic and early-life environmental factors may partially contribute to the diabetes-prostate cancer association.""","""['Cuiping Bao', 'Nancy L Pedersen', 'Rongrong Yang', 'Anna Marseglia', 'Weige Xu', 'Yaogang Wang', 'Xiuying Qi', 'Weili Xu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Type 2 diabetes in midlife and risk of cerebrovascular disease in late life: a prospective nested case-control study in a nationwide Swedish twin cohort.', 'Overweight in midlife and risk of cancer in late life: A nationwide Swedish twin study.', 'Midlife overweight and obesity increase late-life dementia risk: a population-based twin study.', 'Mid- and late-life diabetes in relation to the risk of dementia: a population-based twin study.', 'Familial prostate cancer in Sweden.

Clinical association studies determined that POTEG down-regulation was significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, lymph nodes metastasis and TNM staging. Kaplan-Meier analysis determined that POTEG down-regulation was associated with poorer clinical outcomes of ESCC patients (P = 0.026). Functional studies showed that POTEG overexpression could suppress tumor cell growth and metastasis capacity in vitro and in vivo. Molecular analyses revealed that POTEG downregulated CDKs, leading to subsequent inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, and consequently arrested Cell Cycle at G1/S Checkpoint. POTEG overexpression induced apoptosis by activating caspases and PARP, and regulating canonical mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. On the other side, POTEG inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition and suppressed tumor cell metastasis.

Statistical analysis included log-rank test, Mann-Whitney-Test, ANOVA test and logistic regression (P < 0.05).  Results:   In total 4003 patients were included in the study. Median follow-up was 42 months (min. 2-max. 147 mo.). Regarding ED, an IIEF-5 score of ≥20 was reached by 39% of patients. Regarding SUI, 55% stated that they needed no pads, 21% of patients needed one pad per day. 33% of patients reported of no incontinence (0 p. in ICIQ), 26% of patients reported of a mild incontinence (1-5 p. in ICIQ).

Pathway, network and function analyses of SA were performed with ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), a bioinformatics analysis platform. Disease, biofunction-target networks were established with Cytoscape.  Results:   Eighteen ingredients from SA were obtained.

In the absence of validated tools, many studies use the presence of both the myalgia and arthralgia components of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) to define TAPS.

Patients and methods:   In this prospective, non-randomized study, patients with breast or prostate cancer commencing taxane-based chemotherapy completed the CTCAE (version 4.03), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Taxane (FACT-T), and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaires at baseline and once between days 5 and 7 of each chemotherapy cycle.  Results:   From March 2015 to April 1, 2016, 75 patients (breast n = 66, prostate n = 9) were enrolled; 83% received docetaxel and 16% paclitaxel and 1% withdrew. After the first cycle of taxane, TAPS was reported by 25/69 (36.2%) patients; a further 8/69 (18.2%) reporting TAPS after a subsequent chemotherapy treatment. Overall incidence of TAPS was 33/75 (44%). While associated with detrimental scores on FACT-T and BPI as well as increased use of analgesics in 63% (21/33) of patients with TAPS, TAPS did not lead to alterations in chemotherapy dosing.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common and most aggressively malignant cancers with dismal prognosis. However, the state of IKBKE expression in ESCC is still unknown and its potential value remains unexplored.  Patients and methods:   IKBKE protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 118 paraffin specimens of ESCC treated by curative surgery. All patients were regularly followed up by telephone over 3 years after surgery. The chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard regression model were used to analyze the relationship of IKBKE expression, clinicopathological characteristics, and prognostic value for ESCC.  Results:   IKBKE expression was 61.9% (73/118) in paraffin-embedded archived ESCC. Its expression was significantly associated with tumor differentiation grade (p=0.045) and advanced TNM (pathologic tumor node metastasis) stages (p=0.023). In univariate analysis, IKBKE expression was closely associated with decreased 3-year disease-free survival (HR 1.804, 95% CI 1.076-3.027; p=0.023) and overall survival (HR 2.118, 95% CI 1.189-3.773; p=0.009).

Conclusion:   Our data indicated for the first time that IKKε expression is a highly recurrent event in ESCC and could play a pivotal role in the evaluation of prognosis. IKBKE upregulation is negatively associated with disease-free survival and overall survival.

Hence, we performed a study with artificially prepared, well-characterized urinary specimens that were enriched with sarcosine, a widely reported urinary biomarker for prostate cancer (PCa). For the purposes of the study, a German shepherd dog was utilized for analyses of 60 positive and 120 negative samples. Our study provides the first evidence that a sniffer dog specially trained for the olfactory detection of PCa can recognize sarcosine in artificial urine with a performance [sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 95%, and precision of 90% for the highest amount of sarcosine (10 µmol/L)] that is comparable to the identification of PCa-diagnosed subjects (sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of 91.6%).

Aggressive surgical intervention was ruled out due to a poor prognosis in terms of life expectancy. Death occurred due to hemorrhagic shock resulting from massive oral bleeding caused by necrosis of the mandible. Numerous reports have suggested that jaw necrosis is induced not only by BP, but also RANKL antibody, steroids, and molecularly-targeted agents. This suggests that the number of cases of MRONJ is likely to increase among elderly patients in whom general health is already poor. The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery recommends aggressive treatment only in cases of stage 3 disease. Therefore, such a therapeutic strategy may only be available for cases of jaw necrosis in which the general health status of the patient is otherwise good.

These alterations are revealed by gene profiling and copy number alteration (CNA) analysis. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that also microRNAs have an important role in PC development. Despite efforts to profile PC, the alterations (gene, CNA, and miRNA) and biological processes that correlate with disease development and progression remain partially elusive. Many gene signatures proposed as diagnostic or prognostic tools in cancer poorly overlap. The identification of co-expressed genes, that are functionally related, can identify a core network of genes associated with PC with a better reproducibility. By combining different approaches, including the integration of mRNA expression profiles, CNAs, and miRNA expression levels, we identified a gene signature of four genes overlapping with other published gene signatures and able to distinguish, in silico, high Gleason-scored PC from normal human tissue, which was further enriched to 19 genes by gene co-expression analysis. From the analysis of miRNAs possibly regulating this network, we found that hsa-miR-153 was highly connected to the genes in the network. Our results identify a four-gene signature with diagnostic and prognostic value in PC and suggest an interesting gene network that could play a key regulatory role in PC development and progression. Furthermore, hsa-miR-153, controlling this network, could be a potential biomarker for theranostics in high Gleason-scored PC.""","""['Claudia Cava', 'Gloria Bertoli', 'Antonio Colaprico', 'Gianluca Bontempi', 'Giancarlo Mauri', 'Isabella Castiglioni']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Screening the key microRNAs and transcription factors in prostate cancer based on microRNA functional synergistic relationships.', 'Expression profile analysis reveals putative prostate cancer-related microRNAs.', 'Identification of microRNA signature and potential pathway targets in prostate cancer.', 'Role of miRNA-145, 148, and 185 and Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'Recent scenario of microRNA as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'Discovering Gene Signature Shared by Prostate Cancer and Neurodegenerative Diseases Based on the Bioinformatics Approach.', 'Secreted miR-153 Controls Proliferation and Invasion of Higher Gleason Score Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of key miRNAs in prostate cancer progression based on miRNA-mRNA network construction.', 'Exploration of the Tumor Mutational Burden as a Prognostic Biomarker and Related Hub Gene Identification in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of Breast Cancer Subtype-Specific Biomarkers by Integrating Copy Number Alterations and Gene Expression Profiles.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the SHP and miR-141 expression level in tissue samples of prostate cancer.  Methods:   The expression level of SHP gene and miR-141 was assessed by real time PCR and their relative amounts were calculated by the Δ⁢ΔCT method. Also, IHC technique was used to determine the expression level of SHP protein.  Results:   The miR-141 was significantly up-regulated in the samples of metastatic tumors compared to localized tumor samples (P< 0.001, 31.17-fold change). Tumor samples showed lower SHP mRNA expression levels than BPH samples (p= 0.014, 4.7-fold change).

The enrichment of senescent cells in tissues with age has been associated with tissue dyshomeostasis and age-related pathologies including cancers, neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, etc.) and metabolic disorders (e.g. diabetes). We identified copper accumulation as being a universal feature of senescent cells [mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), human prostate epithelial cells and human diploid fibroblasts] in vitro. Elevated copper in senescent MEFs was accompanied by elevated levels of high-affinity copper uptake protein 1 (Ctr1), diminished levels of copper-transporting ATPase 1 (Atp7a) (copper export) and enhanced antioxidant defence reflected by elevated levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1). The levels of intracellular copper were further increased in senescent MEFs cultured in copper supplemented medium and in senescent Mottled Brindled (Mobr) MEFs lacking functional Atp7a. Finally, we demonstrated that the restoration/preservation of autophagic-lysosomal degradation in senescent MEFs following rapamycin treatment correlated with attenuation of copper accumulation in these cells despite a further decrease in Atp7a levels. This study for the first time establishes a link between Atp7a and the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, and a requirement for both to effect efficient copper export. Such a connection between cellular autophagy and copper homeostasis is significant, as both have emerged as important facets of age-associated degenerative disease.""","""['Shashank Masaldan', 'Sharnel A S Clatworthy', 'Cristina Gamell', 'Zoe M Smith', 'Paul S Francis', 'Delphine Denoyer', 'Peter M Meggyesy', 'Sharon La Fontaine', 'Michael A Cater']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Redox Biol""","""['Involvement of CTR1 and ATP7A in lead (Pb)-induced copper (Cu) accumulation in choroidal epithelial cells.', 'Role of glutaredoxin1 and glutathione in regulating the activity of the copper-transporting P-type ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B.', 'Roles of copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase 1 and metallothionein in copper homeostasis.', 'Copper transport systems are involved in multidrug resistance and drug transport.', 'Dynamic and cell-specific transport networks for intracellular copper ions.', 'Identification of Three Cuproptosis-specific Expressed Genes as Diagnostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Atherosclerosis.', 'Cuproptosis-a potential target for the treatment of osteoporosis.', 'Copper overload impairs hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation via prompting HSF1/SP1 aggregation and the subsequently downregulating FOXM1-Cytoskeleton axis.', 'Among Gerontogens, Heavy Metals Are a Class of Their Own: A Review of the Evidence for Cellular Senescence.', 'Aging and aging-related diseases: from molecular mechanisms to interventions and treatments.']"""

As more men survive prostate cancer, they and their partners need help and support to help them cope with the physical and psychosocial effects of the disease and treatment. There is a lack of psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer and their partners.  Methods:   A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 34 participants to measure the effects of the intervention on selected psychosocial outcomes, post-intervention and at one month' follow-up. The nine-week program (CONNECT) consisted of three group and two telephone sessions. It focused on symptom management, sexual dysfunction, uncertainty management, positive thinking and couple communication. The outcomes, measured by validated tools were: self-efficacy, quality of life, symptom distress, communication, uncertainty and illness benefits.  Results:   The men in the intervention group did better on two outcomes (communication and support) than controls. Partners in the intervention group did better than controls on most outcomes. Less participants than expected participated in the trial. The reasons for non-participation included partners not wishing to participate, men not interested in group work, and not understanding the core purpose of the intervention. The cost of training facilitators and for delivering the intervention appeared to be low.

Experimental approach:   Here, we developed a high throughput screening compatible assay to record TRPM4-mediated Na+ influx in cells using a Na+ -sensitive dye and used this assay to screen a small set of compounds selected by ligand-based virtual screening using previously known weakly active and non-selective TRPM4 inhibitors as seed molecules.

Outside of clinical trials, to our knowledge there exists no standardized protocol to monitor disease progression in men with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa). The objective of the current study was to evaluate the factors and outcomes associated with increased imaging and serum prostate-specific antigen use in men with mPCa.  Methods:   Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data from 2004 to 2012, the authors identified men diagnosed with mPCa with at least 6 months of follow-up. Extreme users were classified as those who had either received prostate-specific antigen testing greater than once per month, or who underwent cross-sectional imaging or bone scan more frequently than every 2 months over a 6-month period. Associations between extreme use and survival outcomes, costs, and quality of care at EOL, as measured by timing of hospice referral, frequency of emergency department visits, length of stay, and intensive care unit or hospital admissions, were examined.  Results:   Overall, a total of 3026 men with mPCa were identified, 791 of whom (26%) were defined as extreme users. Extreme users were more commonly young, white/non-Hispanic, married, higher earning, and more educated (P<.001, respectively). Extreme use was not associated with improved quality of care at EOL. Yearly health care costs after diagnosis were 36.4% higher among extreme users (95% confidence interval, 27.4%-45.3%; P<.001).  Conclusions:   Increased monitoring among men with mPCa significantly increases health care costs, without a definitive improvement in survival nor quality of care at EOL noted.

The authors evaluated the status of cancer prevention for Chinese Americans in San Francisco, which has had years of cancer prevention efforts.  Methods:   Through a community-based clinic serving Chinese Americans, a randomized, controlled trial (n = 395) was conducted among participants who attended either a cancer prevention seminar or biospecimen education seminar. Changes in knowledge, attitudes, and screening completion/intent were measured across and between seminar groups.  Results:   Participants were mostly women who had low acculturation and education levels. Over two-thirds to almost all participants knew about modifiable risk factors for cancer and that screening tests were available, including for lung cancer. The majority of women had already completed mammography and Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. Approximately one-half reported having completed colorectal cancer screening, prostate screening, or hepatitis B screening. Most were nonsmokers, but about one-half ""strongly agreed"" that they would want a test for tobacco smoke exposure. After the cancer prevention seminar, significant increases within group were noted for knowledge (eating healthy foods, from 93.1% to 97.7% [P = .0002]; secondhand smoke causes cancer, from 66.3% to 74.8% [P = .04]) and for screening completion/intent (colorectal cancer, from 58.1% to 64.5% [P = .002] cervical cancer, from 72.9% to 75.5% [P = .04]) and there was a trend toward an increase for prostate cancer (from 50.0% to 61.1%; P = .10). There was a significant change between groups for eating healthy foods (P = .004).  Conclusions:   The current reports documents the gains in cancer prevention among Cantonese-speaking Chinese Americans, fostered by academic, community, and public health efforts. A community-based seminar demonstrated improvement in some cancer knowledge or screening intent and opportunities for continued efforts.

Unlike subcutaneous tumors, orthotopic tumors contain more clinically accurate vasculature, tumor microenvironment, and responses to multiple therapies. In contrast to genetically engineered mouse models, orthotopic models can be performed with lower cost and in less time, involve the use of highly complex and heterogeneous mouse or human cancer cell lines, rather that single genetic alterations, and these cell lines can be genetically modified, such as to express imaging agents. Here, we present a protocol to surgically injecting a luciferase- and mCherry-expressing murine prostate cancer cell line into the anterior prostate lobe of mice. These mice developed orthotopic tumors that were non-invasively monitored in vivo and further analyzed for tumor volume, weight, mouse survival, and immune infiltration. Further, orthotopic tumor-bearing mice were surgically castrated, leading to immediate tumor regression and subsequent recurrence, representing castration-resistant prostate cancer.

From the patient's medical history it was revealed that several hours before the admission in the clinic the following symptoms were present: shortness of breath, fever, hypotonia, consciousness inhibition, because of which emergency brigade was called and was brought by the Emergency Brigade. The history is loaded by chronic pathologies: myeloma disease, prostate cancer, ciliary arrhythmia, heart failure; received several courses of polichemotherapy, last ten days has been treated for pneumonia with antibiotics of ceftriaxone group in outpatient setting. It is also noteworthy that for the last three months dysfunction of musculoskeletal system with muscle weakness, restricted motion has been present. Clinically there was present dysfunction syndrome of several organs: disorder of function of several organs that required emergency intervention, recovery chance was very low, correlation with morbidity in PIRO was high. By investigation it is known, that as SIRS aggravates, and turns into septic shock, lethal index increases, especially when the underlying severe diseases are present. On basis of certain data we can conclude that the severity of the disease may have some compatibility with results, although it is alteration of further clinical status of initial stage that has the closest compatibility with results. Sepsis toward MODS experiences progress with lethal results. Mortality rate in the patients with acute respiratory deficiency increases from 50% to 80%. In most patients with sepsis syndrome, who have 3 or more organs damaged, lethality is more than 90%. In this certain case organ systems that are mostly involved in the process during the sepsis, are respiratory, blood, renal and cardiovascular systems, were all involved , in the mentioned case a reasonable symptomatic and pathognomic treatment and the appropriate measures led to the recovery of the above mentioned patient. Sepsis syndrome is developed when the balance between the substances that contribute to the inflammation and anti-inflammatory substances is violated. By the mentioned case there is sepsis - induced polyorganic insufficiency with underlying severe somatic pathological condition, with violation of hemodynamics. Clinically the insufficiency of all the organic systems developed at the background of cardio-respiratory-cerebral insufficiency, with functional insufficiency of all the organ systems and violation of buffer system.

The primary objective of this study was to compare the intracellular cholesterol turnover in non-cancerous (benign) prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and carcinoma prostate (CAP) with normal prostate cells obtained from patients undergoing radical cystectomy for carcinoma bladder (sham control).  Methods:   ELISA-based estimation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), evaluation of expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and cyclin E, immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, measurement of integrated optical density of the diaminobenzidine (DAB)-stained immunohistograms, isolation of nucleus and cell cytoplasm from prostate tissue by ultracentrifugation followed by estimation of cholesterol spectrophotometrically in isolated nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were performed.  Results:   Seventy five individuals, 25 for each group (BPH n=25; CAP n=25 and sham control n=25), were included in the study. Cholesterol was increased in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the prostate cancer cells along with elevated expression of LDLR. Increased cholesterol concentration in the cell nucleus was found comparable with the increased expression of cholesterol transporter viz. PBR in the prostate tumour tissues as compared to its expression in normal prostate cells obtained from individuals undergoing radical cystectomy for carcinoma bladder. Cell cycle protein cyclin E was also highly expressed in cancer tissues.  Interpretation & conclusions:   The present findings along with increased expression of cell cycle protein cyclin E in the cell nucleus of the tumour tissue suggested the possibility of an intriguing role of cholesterol in the mechanism of cell cycle process of prostate cell proliferation.""","""['Govind Singh', 'Shrimanjunath Sankanagoudar', 'Premnath Dogra', 'Nimai Chand Chandra']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Indian J Med Res""","""['Androgenetic alopecia and polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene (SNP rs6152) in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia or prostate cancer.', 'Expression and function of pro-inflammatory interleukin IL-17 and IL-17 receptor in normal, benign hyperplastic, and malignant prostate.', 'Calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide in the human prostate gland.', 'Expression analysis of thrombospondin 2 in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Cholesterol: A Prelate in Cell Nucleus and its Serendipity.', 'Intratumoral Restoration of miR-137 Plus Cholesterol Favors Homeostasis of the miR-137/Coactivator p160/AR Axis and Negatively Modulates Tumor Progression in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'The evolving landscape of PCSK9 inhibition in cancer.', 'Cholesterol: An important actor on the cancer immune scene.', 'Cholesterol homeostasis and cancer: a new perspective on the low-density lipoprotein receptor.', 'Prostate Cancer-Focus on Cholesterol.']"""

In addition, limited data exist on PD-L1 expression in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we determined PD-L1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry using a validated PD-L1-specific antibody (SP263) in a large and representative cohort of primary prostate cancers and prostate cancer metastases. The study included 539 primary prostate cancers comprising 508 acinar adenocarcinomas, 24 prostatic duct adenocarcinomas, 7 small-cell carcinomas, and a total of 57 cases of mCRPC. PD-L1 positivity was low in primary acinar adenocarcinoma, with only 7.7% of cases showing detectable PD-L1 staining. Increased levels of PD-L1 expression were noted in 42.9% of small-cell carcinomas. In mCRPC, 31.6% of cases showed PD-L1-specific immunoreactivity. In conclusion, in this comprehensive evaluation of PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer, PD-L1 expression is rare in primary prostate cancers, but increased rates of PD-L1 positivity were observed in mCRPC.

In addition to the well-recognized hepatic expression and function of OATP1B3 [herein named liver-type (Lt) OATP1B3], OATP1B3 also expresses in cancers and has been postulated to play a role in cancer therapy, presumably by facilitating the influx of anti-cancer drugs. Recently, a cancer type (Ct)-OATP1B3 mRNA variant was identified in colon and lung cancer tissues, which encodes truncated Ct-OATP1B3 with negligible transport activity. Other than in colon and lung cancers, reports on mRNA expression of OATP1B3 in other cancers cannot distinguish between the Ltand Ct-OATP1B3.  Objective:   The current studies were designed to characterize the expression of Lt- and Ct-OATP1B3 mRNA in ovarian, prostate, bladder, breast, and lung tissues.  Methods:   Lt- and Ct-OATP1B3 isoform-specific PCR primers were utilized to determine the mRNA levels of Lt- and Ct-OATP1B3, respectively.

Methods:   In this retrospective, single-institution pilot study, 45 metastatic prostate cancer cases were identified within the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center Pathology Archive with both metastasis and matched primary prostate tumor specimens in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks, and complete electronic medical records. Thirty non-metastatic, hormone-dependent prostate cancer controls, who were progression-free as defined by undetectable prostate specific antigen for at least 79.6 months (range 79.6-136.0 months), and matched metastatic cases based on age, race, and year of diagnosis. All specimens were collected from 1991 to 2014; primary tumor specimens were obtained via diagnostic biopsy or prostatectomy, and metastasis specimens obtained via surgery or perimortem. 5-μ sequential slides were processed for phospho-Ser-486/491 AMPKα1 /α2 , phospho-Thr-172 AMPKα, AMPKα1 /α2 , phospho-Ser-792 Raptor, phospho-Ser-79 acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and phospho-Ser-872, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase immunohistochemistry to determine expression, phosphorylation pattern, and activity of AMPKα.  Results:   Increased inhibitory Ser-486/491 AMPKα1 /α2 phosphorylation, increased AMPKα protein expression, decreased AMPKα activity, and loss of nuclear AMPKα and p-AMPKα are associated with prostate cancer progression to metastasis. Increased p-Ser-486/491 AMPKα1 /α2 was also positively correlated with higher Gleason grade and progression to castration-resistance.

Large tumor size results in the invasion of adjacent organs and the multiple organ involvement, which poses certain challenges for clinical treatment. When facing advanced stage colorectal cancer, some surgeons do not consider surgery, a reasonable option. However, in fact, multi-disciplinary treatment can achieve relatively good treatment outcomes in patients with advanced stage or locally advanced stage colorectal cancer. Therefore, reasonable surgery should not be hastily abandoned. For patients with large tumors without distant metastases but with multiple organ involvement, directly surgical resection is difficult, therefore, preoperative adjuvant therapy can be considered. The basic principle of surgical treatment is to accomplish maximum protection of organ functions and to perform reasonable regional lymph node dissection on the basis of achieving R0 resection. Common surgical procedures for locally advanced colorectal cancer are as follows: (1)Right-sided colon cancer with duodenal invasion: first, the colon must be freed from three directions, namely the right posterior surface of the colon, the left side of the tumor, and the upper side of the tumor inferior to the pylorus, so as to expose and assess the spatial relationship between the tumor and the duodenum; the actual tumor invasion depth in the duodenum may be shallow. (2) Splenic flexure colon cancer with invasion of the cauda pancreatis and hilum lienis: multivisceral resection must be performed without separating the attachment between the tumor and spleen. The tumor border can be found more easily through manipulations starting from the descending colon. (3) Giant sigmoid colorectal cancer with bladder invasion: invasion usually occurs at the bladder fundus. Therefore, during surgery, the attachment between the rectum and the bladder must not be separated first, but instead, an assessment must be made to determine if the bladder trigone is involved. (4) Rectal cancer with invasion of the sacrum: sacral invasion below S3 can be resected. The proximal end of the rectum to the point where it joins the sacrum is freed, and the rectum is severed. A permanent colostomy is made at the proximal end, while a h-shaped incision is made in the sacrum. The sacrum is then resected along pre-determined resection lines. (5) Rectal cancer with invasion of the uterus, adnexa, vagina, or prostate and seminal vesicles: it is usually observed in low rectal cancer. For unilateral ovarian involvement, combined resection of the bilateral adnexa should be performed. For vaginal involvement, combined resection of the vagina should be performed. For prostatic involvement, partial resection of the prostate can be performed. In general, when facing relatively complicated advanced or locally advanced colorectal cancer, clinical surgeons must adopt a positive attitude and strive zealously against the odds. With the support of multi-disciplinary treatment, the option of surgery must not be hastily abandoned in order to increase the survival chances of patients.""","""['Jin Gu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi""","""['Surgical approach in locally advanced colorectal cancer--combined, extended and compound surgery.', 'Population-based assessment of the surgical management of locally advanced colorectal cancer.', 'Long-term results of surgical resection of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma.', 'Surgical treatment of cancer at the beginning of the third millenium--based on the 2004 Krompecher Memorial Lecture of the Society of Hungarian Oncologists.', 'Sacral resection in surgical treatment of locally advanced primary and recurrent rectal and anal cancer: short-term outcomes.', 'Resection of sigmoid cancer with bladder invasion using laparoscopic combined with a cystoscopic holmium laser: an innovative surgical procedure.', 'LncRNA LINC01116 Promotes the Development of Colorectal Cancer by Targeting miR-9-5p/STMN1.']"""

The prognostic significance of the PI-RADS v2 score based on bp-MRI was assessed with other clinical factors, including the ISUP grade. We defined a positive PI-RADS and ISUP score as ≥ 4 and ≥ 3, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazard models, logistic regression analysis, and the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   The median age and median prostate-specific antigen level were 66 years and 7.96 ng/mL, respectively. The number of positive PI-RADS scores was 106 (84.1%) and the number of positive ISUP grade scores was 71 (56.3%). PI-RADS ≥ 4 (P = .0031) and ISUP ≥ 3 (P = .070) were the 2 independent prognostic factors predictive of BCR. A positive PI-RADS score was related to tumor volume (P = .014), and a positive ISUP score was related to prostate-specific antigen level (P = .043), extraprostatic extension (P = .029), and Gleason upgrading (P < .0001). After stratifying patients into risk groups according to PI-RADS and ISUP positivity, the poor-risk group (PI-RADS and ISUP grade positive) showed significantly worse BCR-free survival compared with that of the favorable- and intermediate-risk groups (P < .0001), with a median survival difference of 21 months.

Patients and methods:   This retrospective population-based cohort study identified 1,908 nonmetastatic PCa patients in the cancer registry Zurich and Zug, diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 living in the City of Zurich. Multiple imputation methods were applied to handle missing PCa information. Fine and Gray competing risk regression analysis was used to estimate subdistribution hazard ratios for the outcomes PCSM, CVDM, or OCM RESULTS: Ten years after diagnosis the cumulative probability of PCSM and CVDM was 16.4% and 10.0%, respectively. We observed an increased adjusted risk of PCSM in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to surgery, but could not observe an association between ADT and CVDM. The probability of PCSM was significantly higher for patients on active surveillance or watchful waiting, compared to surgery. Age and PCa risk categories were positively associated with risk of PCSM, whereas there was no evidence for an association with CVDM or OCM based on risk groups.  Conclusions:   Overall, men with PCa were more likely to die from non-PCa related outcomes.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is chronically produced at low levels within the tumor microenvironment. The aim of this study was to determine whether TNF-α promotes prostate cancer dissemination from metastatic lymph nodes through activation of the CCL21/CCR7 axis. First, human prostate cancer cells were determined to express both TNF-α and CCR7. Second, low concentrations of TNF-α were confirmed to induce CCR7 in prostate cancer cells through phosphorylation of ERK. Finally, CCL21 was found to promote the migration of prostate cancer cells through phosphorylation of the protein kinase p38.

Materials/methods:   We analyzed 375 sets of daily CT images acquired throughout the proton therapy treatment of ten patients. We analyzed daily movements of the prostate, SVs, and rectum by simulating three image-matching strategies: bone matching, prostate center (PC) matching, and prostate-rectum boundary (PRB) matching. In the PC matching, translational movements of the prostate center were corrected after bone matching. In the PRB matching, we performed PC matching and correction along the anterior-posterior direction to match the boundary between the prostate and the rectum's anterior region. In each strategy, we evaluated systematic errors (Σ) and random errors (σ) by measuring the daily movements of certain points on each anatomic structure. The average positional deviations in millimeter of each point were determined by the Van Herk formula of 2.5Σ + 0.7σ. Using these positional deviations, we created planning target volumes of the prostate and SVs and analyzed the daily variation in the water equivalent length (WEL) from the skin surface to the target along the lateral beam directions using the density converted from the daily CT number. Based on this analysis, we designed prostate cancer treatment planning and evaluated the dose volume histograms (DVHs) for these strategies.  Results:   The SVs' daily movements showed large variations over the superior-inferior direction, as did the rectum's anterior region. The average positional deviations of the prostate in the anterior, posterior, superior, inferior, and lateral sides (mm) in bone matching, PC matching, and PRB matching were (8.9, 9.8, 7.5, 3.6, 1.6), (5.6, 6.1, 3.5, 4.5, 1.9), and (8.6, 3.2, 3.5, 4.5, 1.9) (mm), respectively. Moreover, the ones of the SV tip were similarly (22.5, 15.5, 11.0, 7.6, 6.0), (11.8, 8.4, 7.8, 5.2, 6.3), and (9.9, 7.5, 7.8, 5.2, 6.3). PRB matching showed the smallest positional deviations at all portions except for the anterior portion of the prostate and was able to markedly reduce the positional deviations at the posterior portion. The averaged WEL variations at the distal and proximal sides of planning target volumes were estimated 7-9 mm and 4-6 mm, respectively, and showed the increasing of a few millimeters in PC and PRB matching compared to bone matching. In the treatment planning simulation, the DVH values of the rectum in PRB matching were reduced compared to those obtained with other matching strategies.  Conclusion:   The positional deviations for the prostate on the posterior side and the SVs were smaller by PRB matching than the other strategies and effectively reduced the rectal dose. 3D dose calculations indicate that PRB matching with CT image guidance may do a better job relative to other positioning methods to effectively reduce the rectal complications.

However, studies of diet and breast cancer have been inconclusive. We developed a dietary pattern associated with levels of unconjugated estradiol and the ratio of 2- and 16-hydroxylated estrogen metabolites in a subsample of Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Screening Trial (PLCO) participants (n = 653) using reduced rank regression, and examined its association with postmenopausal breast cancer prospectively in the larger PLCO cohort (n = 27,488). The estrogen-related dietary pattern (ERDP) was comprised of foods with positively-weighted intakes (non-whole/refined grains, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, cheese, fish/shellfish high in ω-3 fatty acids, franks/luncheon meats) and negatively-weighted intakes (nuts/seeds, other vegetables, fish/shellfish low in ω-3 fatty acids, yogurt, coffee). A 1-unit increase in the ERDP score was associated with an increase in total (HR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18), invasive (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.04-1.24) and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02-1.24) breast cancer risk after adjustment for confounders. Associations were observed for the fourth quartile of ERDP compared with the first quartile for overall breast cancer (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.98-1.32), invasive cases (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.02-1.42) and ER-positive cases (HR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.99-1.41). The increased risk associated with increasing ERDP score was more apparent in strata of some effect modifiers (postmenopausal hormone therapy non-users and non-obese participants) where the relative estrogen exposure due to that factor was lowest, although the p values for interaction were not statistically significant. Results suggest a dietary pattern based on estrogen metabolism is positively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, possibly through an estrogenic influence.""","""['Mark A Guinter', 'Alexander C McLain', 'Anwar T Merchant', 'Dale P Sandler', 'Susan E Steck']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Estrogen metabolism and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.', 'An estrogen-related lifestyle score is associated with risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in the PLCO cohort.', 'An Estrogen-Related Dietary Pattern and Postmenopausal Breast Cancer Risk in a Cohort of Women with a Family History of Breast Cancer.', 'Epidemiologic studies of estrogen metabolism and breast cancer.', 'Dietary exposure to cadmium and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Dietary patterns and breast cancer risk, prognosis, and quality of life: A systematic review.', 'Dietary patterns related to biological mechanisms and survival after breast cancer diagnosis: results from a cohort study.', 'Dietary Fat Intake: Associations with Dietary Patterns and Postmenopausal Breast Cancer-A Case-Control Study.', 'The Role of Diet in Prognosis among Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Dietary Patterns and Diet Interventions.', 'The involvement of oncobiosis and bacterial metabolite signaling in metastasis formation in breast cancer.']"""

A novel technique to mitigate the impact of tumor motion is real-time adaptation of the multileaf collimator (MLC) aperture to the motion, also known as MLC tracking. Although MLC tracking improves the dosimetric accuracy, there are still residual errors. Here, we investigate and rank the performance of five prediction algorithms and seven improvements of an MLC tracking system by extensive tracking treatment simulations.  Materials and methods:   An in-house-developed MLC tracking simulator that has been experimentally validated against an electromagnetic-guided MLC tracking system was used to test the prediction algorithms and tracking system improvements. The simulator requires a Dicom treatment plan and a motion trajectory as input and outputs all motion of the accelerator during MLC tracking treatment delivery. For lung tumors, MLC tracking treatments were simulated with a low and a high modulation VMAT plan using 99 patient-measured lung tumor trajectories. For prostate, tracking was also simulated with a low and a high modulation VMAT plan, but with 695 prostate trajectories. For each simulated treatment, the tracking error was quantified as the mean MLC exposure error, which is the sum of the overexposed area (irradiated area that should have been shielded according to the treatment plan) and the underexposed area (shielded area that should have been irradiated). First, MLC tracking was simulated with the current MLC tracking system without prediction, with perfect prediction (Perfect), and with the following five prediction algorithms: linear Kalman filter (Kalman), kernel density estimation (KDE), linear adaptive filtering (LAF), wavelet-based multiscale autoregression (wLMS), and time variant seasonal autoregression (TVSAR). Next, MLC tracking was simulated using the best prediction algorithm and seven different tracking system improvements: no localization signal latency (a), doubled maximum MLC leaf speed (b), halved MLC leaf width (c), use of Y backup jaws to track motion perpendicular to the MLC leaves (d), dynamic collimator rotation for alignment of the MLC leaves with the dominant target motion direction (e), improvements 4 and 5 combined (f), and all improvements combined (g).  Results:   All results are presented as the mean residual MLC exposure error compared to no tracking. In the prediction study, the residual MLC exposure error was 47.0% (no prediction), 45.1% (Kalman), 43.8% (KDE), 43.7% (LAF), 42.1% (wLMS), 40.1% (TVSAR), and 36.5% (Perfect) for lung MLC tracking. For prostate MLC tracking, it was 66.0% (no prediction), 66.9% (Kalman), and 63.4% (Perfect). For lung with TVSAR prediction, the residual MLC exposure error for the seven tracking system improvements was 37.2%(1), 38.3%(2), 37.4%(3), 34.2%(4), 30.6%(5), 27.7%(6), and 20.7%(7). For prostate with no prediction, the residual MLC exposure error was 61.7%(1), 61.4%(2), 55.4%(3), 57.2%(4), 47.5%(5), 43.7%(6), and 38.7%(7).  Conclusion:   For prostate, MLC tracking was slightly better without prediction than with linear Kalman filter prediction. For lung, the TVSAR prediction algorithm performed best. Dynamic alignment of the collimator with the dominant motion axis was the most efficient MLC tracking improvement except for lung tracking with the low modulation VMAT plan, where jaw tracking was slightly better.""","""['Jakob Toftegaard', 'Paul J Keall', ""Ricky O'Brien"", 'Dan Ruan', 'Floris Ernst', 'Noriyasu Homma', 'Kei Ichiji', 'Per Rugaard Poulsen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['An experimentally validated couch and MLC tracking simulator used to investigate hybrid couch-MLC tracking.', 'Electromagnetic guided couch and multileaf collimator tracking on a TrueBeam accelerator.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy with dynamic collimator rotation for improved multileaf collimator tracking of the prostate.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'A review of progress of real-time tumor tracking radiotherapy technology based on dynamic multi-leaf collimator.', ""Real-Time 2D MR Cine From Beam Eye's View With Tumor-Volume Projection to Ensure Beam-to-Tumor Conformality for MR-Guided Radiotherapy of Lung Cancer."", 'Couch and multileaf collimator tracking: A clinical feasibility study for pancreas and liver treatment.']"""

Consequently, medical treatment aims to inhibit prostate smooth muscle contraction. However, the efficacy of the treatment options available is limited, and improved understanding of mechanisms of prostate smooth muscle contraction and identification of new targets for medical intervention are mandatory. Several studies suggest that LIM kinases (LIMKs) promote smooth muscle contraction; however, this has not yet been examined. Here, we studied effects of the LIMK inhibitors on prostate smooth muscle contraction.  Experimental approach:   Human prostate tissues were obtained from radical prostatectomy. Phosphorylation of cofilin, a LIMK substrate, was examined using a phospho-specific antibody. Smooth muscle contractions were studied in organ bath experiments.  Key results:   Real-time PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence suggested LIMKs are expressed in smooth muscle cells of prostate tissues. Two different LIMK inhibitors, SR7826 (1 μM) and LIMKi3 (1 μM), inhibited contractions of prostate strips, which were induced by electrical field stimulation, α1 -adrenoceptor agonists phenylephrine and methoxamine and the TXA2 analogue, U46619. LIMK inhibition in prostate tissues and cultured stromal cells (WPMY-1) was confirmed by cofilin phosphorylation, which was reduced by SR7826 and LIMKi3. In WPMY-1 cells, SR7826 and LIMKi3 caused breakdown of actin filaments and reduced viability.  Conclusions and implications:   Smooth muscle tone in the hyperplastic human prostate may underlie the effects of LIMKs, which promote contraction.

However, the relationship between ctDNA abundance, detectable somatic genomic alterations and clinical progression of mCRPC remains unexplored. Our study aimed to investigate changes in plasma DNA during disease progression and their associations with clinical variables in mCRPC patients. We analyzed ctDNA in two cohorts including 94 plasma samples from 25 treatment courses (23 patients) and 334 plasma samples from 125 patients, respectively. We conducted whole-genome sequencing (plasma-Seq) for genome-wide profiling of somatic copy number alterations and targeted sequencing of 31 prostate cancer-associated genes. The combination of plasma-Seq with targeted AR analyses identified prostate cancer-related genomic alterations in 16 of 25 (64%) treatment courses in the first cohort, in which we demonstrated that AR amplification does not always correlate with poor abiraterone and enzalutamide therapy outcome. As we observed a wide variability of ctDNA levels, we evaluated ctDNA levels and their association with clinical parameters and included the second, larger cohort for these analyses. Employing altogether 428 longitudinal plasma samples from 148 patients, we identified the presence of bone metastases, increased lactate dehydrogenase and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as having the strongest association with high ctDNA levels.

The MAGEA11 gene is expressed at low levels in normal human testis, ovary, and endometrium, and at highest levels in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Annotated genome predictions throughout the surviving primate lineage show that MAGEA11 acquired three 5' coding exons unique within the MAGEA subfamily during the evolution of New World monkeys (NWM), Old World monkeys (OWM), and apes. MAGE-A11 in all primates has a conserved FXXIF coactivator-binding motif that suggests interaction with p160 coactivators contributed to its early evolution as a transcriptional coregulator. An ancestral form of MAGE-A11 in the more distantly related lemur has significant amino acid sequence identity with human MAGE-A11, but lacks coregulator activity based on the absence of the three 5' coding exons that include a nuclear localization signal (NLS). NWM MAGE-A11 has greater amino acid sequence identity than lemur to human MAGE-A11, but inframe premature stop codons suggest that MAGEA11 is a pseudogene in NWM. MAGE-A11 in OWM and apes has nearly identical 5' coding exon amino acid sequence and conserved interaction sites for p300 acetyltransferase and cyclin A. We conclude that the evolution of MAGEA11 within the lineage leading to OWM and apes resulted in steroid hormone receptor transcriptional coregulator activity through the acquisition of three 5' coding exons that include a NLS sequence and nonsynonymous substitutions required to interact with cell cycle regulatory proteins and transcription factors.""","""['Christopher S Willett', 'Elizabeth M Wilson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Mol Evol""","""['Gain in transcriptional activity by primate-specific coevolution of melanoma antigen-A11 and its interaction site in androgen receptor.', 'Proto-oncogene activity of melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11) regulates retinoblastoma-related p107 and E2F1 proteins.', 'Melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11) enhances transcriptional activity by linking androgen receptor dimers.', 'Melanoma-associated antigen genes - an update.', 'The melanoma antigen genes--any clues to their functions in normal tissues?', 'Molecular characterization of matrix metalloproteinase gene family across primates.', 'MAGEA6 positively regulates MSMO1 and promotes the migration and invasion of oesophageal cancer cells.', 'Emerging roles of the MAGE protein family in stress response pathways.', 'MAGE-A11 Expression Predicts Patient Prognosis in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.']"""

No AKR1C3-targeted agent has to date been approved for clinical use. Flufenamic acid and indomethacine are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs known to inhibit AKR1C3 in a non-selective manner as COX off-target effects are also observed. Recently, we employed a scaffold hopping approach to design a new class of potent and selective AKR1C3 inhibitors based on a N-substituted hydroxylated triazole pharmacophore. Following a similar strategy, we designed a new series focused around an acidic hydroxybenzoisoxazole moiety, which was rationalised to mimic the benzoic acid role in the flufenamic scaffold. Through iterative rounds of drug design, synthesis and biological evaluation, several compounds were discovered to target AKR1C3 in a selective manner. The most promising compound of series (6) was found to be highly selective (up to 450-fold) for AKR1C3 over the 1C2 isoform with minimal COX1 and COX2 off-target effects.

Despite efforts to dissipate racial disparities in PCa, a survival gap persists and it remains unclear to what extent this disparity can be explained by known clinicodemographic factors. In this study, we leveraged our large institutional database, spanning over 25 years, to investigate whether AAM continued to experience poor PCa outcomes and factors that may contribute to racial disparities in PCa. A total of 7307 patients diagnosed with PCa from 1989 through 2015 were included. Associations of race and clinicodemographic characteristics were analyzed using chi-square for categorical and Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables. Racial differences in prostate cancer outcomes were analyzed using competing risk analysis methods of Fine and Gray. Median follow-up time was 106 months. There were 2304 deaths recorded, of which 432 resulted from PCa. AAM were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier age (median 60 vs. 65 years, P = <0.001) and were more likely to have ≥1 comorbidities (13.6% vs. 7.5%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate competing risk model, adjusted for baseline covariates, AAM experienced significantly higher risk of PCSM compared to NHW men (HR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.02-2.57, P = 0.03) NHW. Among men diagnosed at an older age (>60 years), racial differences in PCSM were more pronounced, with AAM experiencing higher rates of PCSM (HR, 2.05, 95% CI, 1.26-3.34, P = 0.003). After adjustment of clinicodemographic and potential risk factors, AAM continue to experience an increased risk of mortality from PCa, especially older AAM. Furthermore, AAM are more likely to be diagnosed at an early age and more likely to have higher comorbidity indices.""","""['Vonetta L Williams', 'Shivanshu Awasthi', 'Angelina K Fink', 'Julio M Pow-Sang', 'Jong Y Park', 'Travis Gerke', 'Kosj Yamoah']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Outcomes in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.', 'Validation of a genomic classifier for prediction of metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality in African-American men following radical prostatectomy in an equal access healthcare setting.', 'Racial disparities in prostate cancer outcome among prostate-specific antigen screening eligible populations in the United States.', 'Racial disparities in Black men with prostate cancer: A literature review.', 'Age-related racial disparities in prostate cancer patients: A systematic review.', 'Evaluation of Social Determinants of Health and Prostate Cancer Outcomes Among Black and White Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Race-specific prostate cancer outcomes in a cohort of military health care beneficiaries undergoing surgery: 1990-2017.', 'Race-specific prostate cancer outcomes in a cohort of low and favorable-intermediate risk patients who underwent external beam radiation therapy from 1990 to 2017.', 'Disparities in the Utilization of Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer in the United States: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Precision intervention for prostate cancer: Re-evaluating who is at risk.']"""

We previously reported that collapsing response mediator protein-4 (CRMP4) is a PCa metastasis-suppressor gene and the hypermethylation in CRMP4 promoter is responsible for the transcription repression in metastatic PCa. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of calpain-2 in CRMP4 promoter hypermethylation and its functional modulation in PCa metastasis.  Methods:   Calpain-2 expression in PCa tissues (n = 87) and its specific mechanisms of functional modulation in CRMP4 expression via limited enzymatic cleavage was investigated. We then focused on the cooperative crosstalk of calpain-2 and NF-κB RelA/p65 in CRMP4 promoter methylation for the initiation of PCa metastasis. Statistical differences between groups were determined using a two-tailed Student's t-test. P < 0.05 indicated statistically significant.  Results:   Calpain-2 was differentially upregulated in metastatic PCa compared with localized PCa. Moreover, calpain-2 cleaved CRMP4 into the N-terminally fragment which promoted migration and invasion in PCa cells via nuclear translocation and activation of E2F1-mediated DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression. NF-κB RelA/p65 recruited DNMT1 to bind to and methylate CRMP4 promoter in which Serine276 phosphorylation of p65 was essential. Furthermore, CRMP4 exhibited anti-metastatic function via inhibiting the expression of VEGFC through Semaphorin3B-Neuropilin2 signaling.  Conclusion:   Calpain-2 may contribute to the promoter methylation of CRMP4 to repress its transcription, leading to the metastasis of PCa via enhancing VEGFC expression.""","""['Xin Gao', 'Yun-Hua Mao', 'Chutian Xiao', 'Ke Li', 'Wei Liu', 'Liao-Yuan Li', 'Jun Pang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Manipulation of prostate cancer metastasis by locus-specific modification of the CRMP4 promoter region using chimeric TALE DNA methyltransferase and demethylase.', 'Expression profiling identifies new function of collapsin response mediator protein 4 as a metastasis-suppressor in prostate cancer.', 'Prospective Study of CRMP4 Promoter Methylation in Prostate Biopsies as a Predictor For Lymph Node Metastases.', 'Raf kinase inhibitor protein: a prostate cancer metastasis suppressor gene.', 'Promoter hypermethylation in prostate cancer.', 'CAST as a Potential Oncogene, Identified by Machine Search, in Gastric Cancer Infiltrated with Macrophages and Associated with Lgr5.', 'CRMP4 CpG Hypermethylation Predicts Upgrading to Gleason Score ≥ 8 in Prostate Cancer.', 'CRMP5 regulates cell proliferation and development of colorectal cancer via MAPK-dependent signaling.', 'TNF-α/NF-κB signaling epigenetically represses PSD4 transcription to promote alcohol-related hepatocellular carcinoma progression.', 'Deciphering the Role of Ca2+ Signalling in Cancer Metastasis: From the Bench to the Bedside.']"""

The primary cause of death is metastasis, with secondary lesions most commonly occurring in the skeleton. Prostate cancer to bone metastasis is an important, yet poorly understood, process that is difficult to explore with experimental techniques alone. To this end we have utilized a hybrid (discrete-continuum) cellular automaton model of normal bone matrix homeostasis that allowed us to investigate how metastatic PCa can disrupt the bone microenvironment. Our previously published results showed that PCa cells can recruit mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that give rise to bone-building osteoblasts. MSCs are also thought to be complicit in the establishment of successful bone metastases (Lu, in Mol Cancer Res 4(4):221-233, 2006). Here we have explored the aspects of early metastatic colonization and shown that the size of PCa clusters needs to be within a specific range to become successfully established: sufficiently large to maximize success, but not too large to risk failure through competition among cancer and stromal cells for scarce resources. Furthermore, we show that MSC recruitment can promote the establishment of a metastasis and compensate for relatively low numbers of PCa cells seeding the bone microenvironment. Combined, our results highlight the utility of biologically driven computational models that capture the complex and dynamic dialogue between cells during the initiation of active metastases.""","""['Arturo Araujo', 'Leah M Cook', 'Conor C Lynch', 'David Basanta']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Bull Math Biol""","""['Pathogenesis of osteoblastic bone metastases from prostate cancer.', 'An integrated computational model of the bone microenvironment in bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'A 3D in\xa0vitro model of patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft for controlled interrogation of in\xa0vivo tumor-stromal interactions.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The role of tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'How circulating tumor cluster biology contributes to the metastatic cascade: from invasion to dissemination and dormancy.', 'Classical mathematical models for prediction of response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy.', 'An agent-based model of prostate Cancer bone metastasis progression and response to Radium223.', 'Tumor Cell Dormancy and Reactivation in Bone: Skeletal Biology and Therapeutic Opportunities.']"""

MicroRNAs are globally downregulated in PCa, especially in poorly differentiated tumors. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Herein, using combined analysis of microRNAs expression and genomewide DNA methylation, we aimed to identify epigenetically downregulated microRNAs in PCa.  Results:   We found that miR-152-3p was underexpressed in PCa and that lower expression levels were associated with promoter hypermethylation in accordance with TCGA dataset analysis. Functional in vitro assays suggest that miR-152-3p suppresses cell viability and invasion potential, whereas it promotes cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases. Additionally, miR-152-3p expression was associated with longer disease-free survival in PCa patients from TCGA. Finally, TMEM97, which is overexpressed in PCa, was identified as a novel miR-152-3p target gene.  Conclusions:   Our findings demonstrate the advantages of using a combinatory approach to identify microRNAs downregulated due to aberrant promoter methylation.

It is cleaved by calpain at the hinge 1 and 2 domains, producing a 90-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment (FLNACT). Recently, it has been shown that FLNACT mediates cell signaling and transports transcription factors into the cell nucleus. However, the significance of cleavage of FLNA by calpain has not been studied in cancer cell growth. Calpeptin is a chemical inhibitor of both calpain 1 and 2 that cleaves FLNA.

Materials and methods:   The numbers of LNCaP cells were counted when co-cultured with DU145 or PC-3 cells and vise versa. Androgen receptor (AR) activity in LNCaP cells was examined by luciferase reporter assay after transfection with a luciferase reporter driven by PSA promoter in the presence of DU145 or PC-3 cells. Concentration of androgens in the medium was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The ability of migration and invasion of PC-3 and DU145 cells was investigated using a 2-layer chamber, in the presence of LNCaP cells.  Results:   Co-culture of LNCaP cells with DU145 cells resulted in the conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which stimulated cell proliferation and PSA promoter activity in LNCaP cells. The increased cell proliferation rate and AR activity, induced in LNCaP cells after DHT treatment, was further enhanced by co-culture with DU145 cells. LNCaP cells also stimulated the proliferation of DU145 and PC-3 cells, via secreting soluble factors. Finally, LNCaP cells promoted migration and invasion of PC-3 cells, in a co-culture system; however inhibited migration and invasion of DU145 cells.  Conclusion:   Crosstalk between androgen-sensitive PCa cells and androgen-insensitive PCa cells might develop the progression of PCa.""","""['Yuta Takezawa', 'Kouji Izumi', 'Kazuaki Machioka', 'Hiroaki Iwamoto', 'Renato Naito', 'Tomoyuki Makino', 'Suguru Kadomoto', 'Ariunbold Natsagdorj', 'Yoshifumi Kadono', 'Evan T Keller', 'Jian Zhang', 'Atsushi Mizokami']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Prostate cancer stromal cells and LNCaP cells coordinately activate the androgen receptor through synthesis of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone from dehydroepiandrosterone.', 'Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.', 'Identification of an anabolic selective androgen receptor modulator that actively induces death of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: more than just androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Comparison of the roles of estrogens and androgens in breast cancer and prostate cancer.', 'Par14 interacts with the androgen receptor, augmenting both its transcriptional activity and prostate cancer proliferation.', 'Can local treatment prolong the sensitivity of metastatic prostate cancer to androgen deprivation or even prevent castration resistance?', 'Cholesterol and Its Metabolites in Tumor Growth: Therapeutic Potential of Statins in Cancer Treatment.', 'Comparative Secretome Profiling and Mutant Protein Identification in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells by Quantitative Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomics.']"""

Increasingly family members are assuming the role of providing care and support to family members with chronic disease. Understanding the role and influence of the caregiver is a necessary part of developing resources to assist individuals learning to provide care.  Aim:   The analysis aimed to explore CaP survivors' perceptions of the role and influence of family caregivers to better understand existing opportunities for improving experiences and outcomes for both the caregiver and the care receiver.  Design:   Secondary analysis of qualitative interview transcripts. Data were analyzed to explore new inquiries related to CaP survivors' perceptions of family caregivers' role and influence at each stage of care. Content analysis was used to group data into established categories.  Data source:   Data included qualitative interview transcripts with 32 CaP survivors from the Florida Prostate Cancer Care and Survivorship Project.  Results:   The role of the family caregiver is complex. Caregivers in this community seem to have a significant influence on behavior modification and cues to action for Black men with prostate cancer. According to the men in this group, caregivers functioned as normalizing agents, coordinating care and creating a new normal, throughout the various stages of care and survivorship.

The antiproliferative activity of the obtained compounds against some human cancer cell lines was investigated. Using xanthohumol isolated from spent hops as a lead compound, a series of minor hop prenylflavonoids and synthetic derivatives were obtained by isomerization, cyclisation, oxidative-cyclisation, oxidation, reduction and demethylation reactions. Three human cancer cell lines-breast (MCF-7), prostate (PC-3) and colon (HT-29)-were used in antiproliferative assays, with cisplatin as a control compound. Five minor hop prenyl flavonoids and nine non-natural derivatives of xanthohumol have been synthetized. Syntheses of xanthohumol K, its dihydro- and tetrahydro-derivatives and 1″,2″,α,β-tetrahydroxanthohumol C were described for the first time. All of the minor hops prenyl flavonoids exhibited strong to moderate antiproliferative activity in vitro. The minor hops flavonoids xanthohumol C and 1″,2″-dihydroxanthohumol K and non-natural 2,3-dehydroisoxanthohumol exhibited the activity comparable to cisplatin. Results described in the article suggest that flavonoids containing chromane- and chromene-like moieties, especially chalcones, are potent antiproliferative agents. The developed new efficient, regioselective cyclisation reaction of the xanthohumol prenyl group to 1″,2″-dihydroxantohumol K may be used in the synthesis of other compounds with the chromane moiety.""","""['Jarosław Popłoński', 'Eliza Turlej', 'Sandra Sordon', 'Tomasz Tronina', 'Agnieszka Bartmańska', 'Joanna Wietrzyk', 'Ewa Huszcza']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Highly Cancer Selective Antiproliferative Activity of Natural Prenylated Flavonoids.', 'Fungal metabolites of xanthohumol with potent antiproliferative activity on human cancer cell lines in vitro.', 'Xanthohumol and related prenylflavonoids from hops and beer: to your good health!', 'Antimicrobial Properties of Spent Hops Extracts, Flavonoids Isolated Therefrom, and Their Derivatives.', 'The Multiple Biological Targets of Hops and Bioactive Compounds.', 'The Effect of Xanthohumol Derivatives on Apoptosis Induction in Canine Lymphoma and Leukemia Cell Lines.', 'Prenylated Flavonoids with Selective Toxicity against Human Cancers.', 'Antioxidants in Hops: Bioavailability, Health Effects and Perspectives for New Products.', 'Anticancer Activity of Natural and Synthetic Chalcones.', 'Bioactive Compounds Obtained from Polish ""Marynka"" Hop Variety Using Efficient Two-Step Supercritical Fluid Extraction and Comparison of Their Antibacterial, Cytotoxic, and Anti-Proliferative Activities In Vitro.']"""

Aberrant expression of miRNA and imbalance in their functions may lead to cellular aberration and different disease development, including cancer. In silico analysis of miRNA target prediction suggested that miR-148a possess a binding site in the 3' UTR of DNMT1 mRNA which can cause silencing of DNMT1 gene. Accordingly, we performed in vitro cell culture experiments to confirm the effect miR-148a on DNMT1 gene expression in prostate cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that there is a physical association between DNMT1 mRNA and miR-148a. We found that (i) ectopic expression of miR-148a induces programmed cell death and represses cell proliferation by targeting DNMT1; (ii) miR-148a gene is regulated by DNA methylation and DNMT1 in prostate cancer.

Recently, we identified DNA adducts of PhIP in the genome of prostate cancer patients, but adducts of 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylmidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-9 H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AαC), other prominent HAAs formed in cooked meats, were not detected. We have investigated the bioactivation of HAAs by Phase I and II enzymes in the human prostate (LNCaP) cell line using cytotoxicity and DNA adducts as endpoints. PhIP, MeIQx, and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline, another HAA found in cooked meats, were poorly bioactivated and not toxic. The synthetic genotoxic N-hydroxylated-HAAs were also assayed in LNCaP cells with Phase II enzyme inhibitors. Notably, 2-hydroxy-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (HONH-PhIP), but not other HONH-HAAs, induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, PhIP-DNA adduct formation was 20-fold greater than adducts formed with other HONH-HAAs. Pretreatment of LNCaP cells with mefenamic acid, a specific inhibitor of sulfotransferase (SULT1A1), decreased PhIP-DNA adducts by 25%, whereas (Z)-5-(2'-hydroxybenzylidene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one and pentachlorophenol, inhibitors of SULTs and N-acetyltransferases (NATs), decreased the PhIP-DNA adduct levels by 75%. NATs in cytosolic fractions of LNCaP cells and human prostate catalyzed DNA binding of HONH-PhIP by up to 100-fold greater levels than for SULT and kinase activities. Recombinant NAT2 is catalytically superior to recombinant NAT1 in the bioactivation of HONH-PhIP; however, the extremely low levels of NAT2 activity in prostate suggest that NAT1 may be the major isoform involved in PhIP-DNA damage. Thus, the high susceptibility of LNCaP cells recapitulates the DNA-damaging effect of HONH-PhIP in rodent and human prostate.""","""['Medjda Bellamri', 'Shun Xiao', 'Paari Murugan', 'Christopher J Weight', 'Robert J Turesky']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Toxicol Sci""","""['The Cooked Meat Carcinogen 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine Hair Dosimeter, DNA Adductomics Discovery, and Associations with Prostate Cancer Pathology Biomarkers.', 'Biomonitoring DNA Adducts of Cooked Meat Carcinogens in Human Prostate by Nano Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Tandem Mass Spectrometry: Identification of 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine DNA Adduct.', 'A comprehensive approach to the profiling of the cooked meat carcinogens 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo4,5-fquinoxaline, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine, and their metabolites in human urine.', 'Protection against 2-hydroxyamino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine cytotoxicity and DNA adduct formation in human prostate by glutathione S-transferase P1.', 'Mammary gland carcinogenesis by food-derived heterocyclic amines and studies on the mechanisms of carcinogenesis of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine (PhIP).', 'The Cooked Meat Carcinogen 2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo4,5-bpyridine Hair Dosimeter, DNA Adductomics Discovery, and Associations with Prostate Cancer Pathology Biomarkers.', 'Association Between Red and Processed Meat Consumption and Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Metabolic Evidence Rather Than Amounts of Red or Processed Meat as a Risk on Korean Colorectal Cancer.', 'Metabolism and biomarkers of heterocyclic aromatic amines in humans.', 'Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the carcinogen aristolochic acid I (AA-I) in human bladder RT4 cells.']"""

Several factors can increase one’s risk of CRC, including a personal or family history of CRC, a diagnosis or family history of a hereditary colon cancer syndrome, or a diagnosis of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this project was to create a colorectal cancer registry (Co-Care) for individuals with a personal or family history of CRC, and those with disorders of the colon or rectum that are associated with an increased risk for developing CRC. METHODS: To be eligible for the registry, patients either had a personal or family history of CRC, a diagnosis or family history of Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, or a diagnosis of Crohn’s colitis or ulcerative colitis with dysplasia. Participants were recruited after seeing their gastroenterologist or genetic counselor, or after undergoing a full or partial colectomy at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Eligible patients who agreed to participate were interviewed by a member of the research staff and asked a wide range of questions pertaining to CRC risk. RESULTS: A total of 224 patients were enrolled in the registry. Participants are mostly white, born in the United States, and married, with a bachelor’s or graduate degree, reporting an annual household income of $100,000 or more. The largest portion have a family history of CRC (27.2%), and almost half of participants are of Jewish descent (46.2%) and have undergone full or partial colectomy (48.2%). More than half of participants have neither received genetic counseling (54.5%) nor undergone genetic testing (59.7%). Only 3.6% report that they currently smoke cigarettes, and 41.1% consume alcohol at least once per week. Lastly, 18.3%, 10.3%, and 27.7% of participants report that they currently take aspirin, folic acid/folate pills or tablets, or calcium pills/tablets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This registry can improve our understanding of CRC and related diseases, and be used to design future interventions related to disease risk, prognosis, and prevention of CRC.""","""['Jie Lin', 'Christine Kamamia', 'Stephanie Shao', 'Derek Brown', 'Paul D Rockswold', 'Elizabeth Butts', 'Craig D Shriver', 'Kangmin Zhu']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""J Registry Manag""","""['Co-Care: A Registry for Individuals at Increased Risk for Colorectal Cancer.', 'Prophylactic Oophorectomy: Reducing the U.S. Death Rate from Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.

Dibenzoylmethane (DBM) is a minor constituent of licorice. Both compounds have been shown to exert anticancer activities. In the present study, we determined the effects of PEITC and DBM alone or in combination on androgen-independent growth of human prostate cancer cells cultured in vitro and prostate VCaP xenograft tumors in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. PEITC and DBM in combination had stronger effects on inhibiting the growth and inducing apoptosis than either compound alone in cultured prostate cancer cells. The combination also strongly inhibited cell migration and the formation of tumorspheres in VCaP cells. Mechanistic studies showed that the combined effects of PEITC and DBM on growth inhibition and apoptosis were associated with suppression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and a decrease in the levels of survivin and phospho-Akt (pAkt). In the in vivo study, SCID mice bearing VCaP tumors were surgically castrated and treated with PEITC and/or DBM. Treatment with PEITC and DBM in combination resulted in a strong inhibition of the progression of androgen-dependent VCaP prostate tumors to androgen independence. Our results indicate that administration of DBM and PEITC in combination may be an effective strategy for inhibiting/delaying the progression of prostate cancer to androgen independence.""","""['Huarong Huang', 'Yan He', 'Lanyue Zhang', 'Hongping Xiang', 'Dongli Li', 'Wenfeng Liu', 'Xue-Tao Xu', 'Susan Goodin', 'Kun Zhang', 'Xi Zheng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Food Funct""","""['p53 mutant-type in human prostate cancer cells determines the sensitivity to phenethyl isothiocyanate induced growth inhibition.', 'Combined inhibitory effects of curcumin and phenethyl isothiocyanate on the growth of human PC-3 prostate xenografts in immunodeficient mice.', 'Inhibition of androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cell tumor xenograft growth by dietary phenethyl isothiocyanate correlates with decreased angiogenesis and inhibition of cell attachment.', 'Ingestion of an isothiocyanate metabolite from cruciferous vegetables inhibits growth of human prostate cancer cell xenografts by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.', 'Prostate cancer chemopreventive activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate through epigenetic regulation (review).', 'Improvement of glucosinolates by metabolic engineering in Brassica crops.', 'Hesperidin Suppresses the Proliferation of Prostate Cancer Cells by Inducing Oxidative Stress and Disrupting Ca2+ Homeostasis.', 'Nobiletin, a citrus polymethoxyflavone, enhances the effects of bicalutamide on prostate cancer cells via down regulation of NF-κB, STAT3, and ERK activation.', 'Exploration in the Mechanism of Action of Licorice by Network Pharmacology.']"""

Methods The expression level of miR-519d-3p in PC-3, DU-145, 22RV1, PC-3M, LNCaP human prostate cancer cells and RWPE-1 human normal prostate epithelial cells was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. miR-519d-3p mimics or negative control microRNAs (miR-NC) was transfected into the prostate cancer cells with the lowest level of miR-519d-3p expression. Transfection efficiency was examined. The effect of miR-519d-3p on the cell cycle of prostate cancer was detected by flow cytometry. MTT assay and plate clone formation assay were used to detect its effect on the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Bioinformatics software was used to predict and dual luciferase reporter assay was used to validate the target gene of miR-519d-3p. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-519d-3p target gene. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of target gene protein and downstream protein. Results The expression of miR-519d-3p in normal prostate epithelial cells was significantly higher than that in prostate cancer cells, and the lowest was found in DU-145 cells. After transfected with miR-519d-3p mimics, the expression level of miR-519d-3p in DU-145 cells increased significantly. Bioinformatics prediction and dual luciferase reporter gene confirmed that tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 4 (TRAF4) was the target gene of miR-519d-3p. Overexpression of miR-519d-3p significantly reduced the expression of TRAF4 gene and its downstream TGF-β signaling pathway proteins in the prostate cancer cells. Conclusion The expression of miR-519d-3p is down-regulated in prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-519d-3p can inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   All the consecutive patients undergoing RSP up to January 2015 were included. The series was divided into three groups based on prostate weight at radical prostatectomy specimen (<40 g, 40-60 g, >60 g). Perioperative, oncological and functional data were prospectively recorded. Potency was defined as erections sufficient for penetration; continence as no pad or one safety liner. Oncological results were reported as positive surgical margins (PSMs) and 1-year biochemical disease-free survival (PSA<0.2 ng/mL).  Results:   We evaluated 750 patients (366 with <40 g prostates, 272 with 40-60 g prostates, 112 with >60 g prostates). Median follow-up was 22 months; PSA was higher in larger prostates (6.6 vs. 6.8 vs. 8 ng/mL). Nerve-sparing and bladder-neck sparing procedures were in similar percentages. Larger prostates required longer surgeries (90 vs. 100 vs. 100 minutes, P=0.002). Perioperative results were similar (blood loss, discharge, complications, catheter removal). Larger prostates had more frequently localized disease (pT2 in 49.5% vs. 60.7% vs. 68.5%; P=0.001); PSMs were similar both in pT2 (15.5% vs. 9.4% vs. 11.8%) and in pT3 cases (40.1% vs. 42% vs. 34%).

However, recent studies revealed that while inhibiting the growth of certain types of prostate cancer cells, ADT promotes invasion. In the current study, we explored the effects of Nur77, an orphan nuclear receptor, on prostate cancer cell invasion following ADT.  Methods:   Androgen receptor (AR) and Nur77 protein expression in patient tissues and cell lines were quantified via ELISA and western blot. The effects of AR-signaling on Nur77 expression were examined. The effects of Nur77 over-expression and knockdown on ADT-induced prostate cancer cell invasion were characterized.  Results:   The results showed that AR and Nur77 are both highly expressed in prostate cancers of patients. Nur77 is positively regulated by AR-signaling at transcriptional level in NCI-H660, a widely used prostate cancer cell line. AR antagonists, Casodex and MDV3100 treatment resulted in significant inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth but enhanced cancer cell invasion. Nur77 over-expression blocked invasion-promoting effect of ADT, which is consistent with the down-regulation of MMP9 and Snail protein expression. Further mechanistic investigations showed that Nur77 inhibited transcription of TGF-β target genes (Snail and MMP9), and thereby inhibits TGF-β-mediated prostate cancer cell invasion following androgen antagonism. In addition, our data suggested the nature of this inhibitory effect of Nur77 on TGF-β-signaling is selective, for Smad3-signaling, the classical effector of TGF-β-signaling, was not interrupted by Nur77 over-expression.  Conclusion:   Considering the limited success of management of prostate cancer metastasis following ADT, our data strongly suggest that Nur77 regulation could be a promising direction for search of complementary therapeutic strategy on top of classic ADT therapy.""","""['J Wu', 'H Sun', 'X Yang', 'X Sun']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Differential androgen deprivation therapies with anti-androgens casodex/bicalutamide or MDV3100/Enzalutamide versus anti-androgen receptor ASC-J9(R) Lead to promotion versus suppression of prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Loss of SPDEF and gain of TGFBI activity after androgen deprivation therapy promote EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'TGF-beta signaling and androgen receptor status determine apoptotic cross-talk in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Differential androgen receptor signals in different cells explain why androgen-deprivation therapy of prostate cancer fails.', 'Interplay between orphan nuclear receptors and androgen receptor-dependent or-independent growth signalings in prostate cancer.', 'Nur77 Serves as a Potential Prognostic Biomarker That Correlates with Immune Infiltration and May Act as a Good Target for Prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'NR4A1 inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of hepatic stellate cells: Involvement of TGF-β-Smad2/3/4-ZEB signaling.', 'Orphan nuclear receptors as regulators of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cantharidin Induces Apoptosis and Promotes Differentiation of AML Cells Through Nuclear Receptor Nur77-Mediated Signaling Pathway.']"""

Methods:   To explore the role of inflammation in prostate cancer risk further, we examined the association between pre-diagnostic serum levels of interleukin-16 (IL-16), an important pleiotropic cytokine, and prostate cancer risk among 932 Caucasian cases and 942 controls and 154 African-American cases and 302 controls in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Serum IL-16 was quantified using enzyme-linked immunoassay. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between IL-16 and prostate cancer risk, separately by race.  Results:   Although no association between IL-16 and prostate cancer overall was observed among Caucasians (p = 0.27), a significantly increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer, defined as Gleason ≥ 7 (phet = 0.02), was observed with increasing levels of IL-16 (OR3rd vs. 1st tertile = 1.37, 95% CI 1.04-1.81, ptrend = 0.02). We also discovered a significant interaction between IL-16 and history of gonorrhea (p = 0.04). Among Caucasian men with a history of gonorrhea, elevated IL-16 levels were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (OR3rd vs. 1st tertile = 3.64, 95% CI 1.14-11.6) but no association was seen among those without a history of gonorrhea (OR3rd vs. 1st tertile = 1.06, 95% CI 0.83-1.34).

Genotyping of three SNPs rs73318382, rs57095329, rs2910164 in miRNA146a, rs11614913 in miR-196a2 and rs41275794, rs12976445, rs10404453 and rs1297533 in miR-125a was performed in 100 cases and 100 controls. Statistical analysis revealed the heterozygous AG genotype of the rs57095329 was significantly decreased in the cases when compared to the controls (OR-0.45, CI -0.24 to 0.85, p value-0.02) indicating an inverse association of this genotype with prostate cancer. Further the heterozygous CT of miR-196a2 (rs11614913) (OR-1.88, CI-1.06 to 3.35, p-0.02) and homozygous CC of miR-125a (rs12976445) (OR-2.55, CI -1.15 to 4.65, p-0.03) showed increased risk for prostate cancer. Combined analysis of all the genotypes revealed that the haplotype combination AGGCGTGG (OR = 0.09 at CI 95% (0.01-0.65) showed an inverse association with prostate cancer. Stratified analysis based on the age and tumor grade revealed no significant association.""","""['Mohan Damodaran', 'Solomon F D Paul', 'Vettriselvi Venkatesan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pathol Oncol Res""","""['Evaluation of a Panel of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms in miR-146a and miR-196a2 Genomic Regions in Patients with Chronic Periodontitis.', 'Association analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in miR-146a and miR-196a2 on the prevalence of cancer in elderly Japanese: a case-control study.', 'The association between two common polymorphisms (miR-146a rs2910164 and miR-196a2 rs11614913) and susceptibility to gastric cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'The association of common functional polymorphisms in mir-146a and mir-196a2 and hepatocellular carcinoma risk: evidence from a meta-analysis.', 'Genetic variations in MicroRNA genes and cancer risk: A field synopsis and meta-analysis.', 'Mechanisms and application strategies of miRNA‑146a regulating inflammation and fibrosis at molecular and cellular levels (Review).', 'Curcumol Inhibits the Development of Prostate Cancer by miR-125a/STAT3 Axis.', 'Promising Biomarkers in Head and Neck Cancer: The Most Clinically Important miRNAs.', 'Effect of miR-196a2 rs11614913 Polymorphism on Cancer Susceptibility: Evidence From an Updated Meta-Analysis.', 'Association between miR-146a rs2910164, miR-196a2 rs11614913, and miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphisms and the risk of esophageal carcinoma: A case-control study.']"""

Treatment patterns for patients receiving consultation from radiation oncologists in addition to urologists have not previously been described.  Methods:   We conducted a matched cohort study of men with newly diagnosed non-metastatic prostate cancer in Ontario, Canada. Patients who underwent consultation with a radiation oncologist prior to treatment were matched 1:1 with patients managed by a urologist alone based on tumour and patient characteristics. We examined rates of active treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) within one year following diagnosis.  Results:   Among 5708 matched pairs (11,416 patients), those who received radiation oncology consultation were more likely to undergo active treatments whether they had intermediate or high-risk disease (88.6% vs. 65.9%, p < 0.0001; adjusted odds ratio 4.0, 95% CI: 3.6-4.4) or low-risk disease (56.1% vs. 13.3%, p < 0.0001; adjusted odds ratio 8.4, 95% CI: 6.7-10.6). This effect persisted after considering age, comorbidity, tumour volume and year of diagnosis.

However, the steep Trendelenburg position (25) and pneumoperitoneum required for this procedure can sometimes cause hemodynamic changes. Although blood pressure is traditionally monitored invasively during RALRP, the ClearSight system (BMEYE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) enables a totally noninvasive and simple continuous blood pressure and cardiac output monitoring based on finger arterial pressure pulse contour analysis. We therefore investigated whether noninvasive continuous arterial blood pressure measurements using the ClearSight system were comparable to those obtained invasively in patients undergoing RALRP. Ten patients scheduled for RALRP with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II were included in this study. At each of the seven defined time points, noninvasive and invasive blood pressure measurements were documented and compared in each patient using Bland-Altman analysis. Although the blood pressure measured with the ClearSight system correlated with that measured invasively, a large difference between the values obtained by the two devices was noted. The ClearSight system was unable to detect blood pressure accurately during RALRP, suggesting that blood pressure monitoring using this device alone is not feasible in this small patient population.

Health professionals (HPs) are well suited to provide lifestyle advice but few survivors report receiving guidance from them. This study aimed to explore HPs' perspective of lifestyle advice (on healthy eating, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol) for cancer survivors.  Design:   In-depth semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone or face to face. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis.  Setting and participants:   Twenty-one UK HPs working in secondary care with breast, prostate or colorectal cancer survivors were interviewed.  Results:   The overarching theme was that HPs' desire to provide lifestyle advice was not necessarily matched by knowledge and action. Three main themes were identified: (1) survivorship-centred barriers to provision, (2) HP-centred barriers to provision, and (3) optimal delivery of lifestyle advice. Results suggested that HPs' perceptions of survivors' current status of practising health behaviours, their perceived socioeconomic barriers and ability to practise health behaviours, and HPs' fear for potential loss of connection with the patient influenced provision of lifestyle advice. Further factors included HPs' knowledge of healthy lifestyle guidelines, feeling that they were not the 'right person' to provide advice, and lack of time and resources. HPs stressed that the optimal delivery of lifestyle advice should (1) be tailored to the individual and delivered throughout the cancer journey, (2) be focused on small and achievable changes framed as part of their treatment regimen and (3) be cost-effective for wide-scale implementation.  Conclusions:   Incorporation of the identified barriers when developing HP training programmes and lifestyle interventions could increase the probability of successful behavioural change, and thus improve outcomes for cancer survivors.""","""['Dimitrios A Koutoukidis#', 'Sonia Lopes#', 'Abigail Fisher', 'Kate Williams', 'Helen Croker', 'Rebecca J Beeken']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Barriers to and facilitators of smoking cessation in pregnancy and following childbirth: literature review and qualitative study.', ""Health Professionals' Views on Lifestyle Advice Delivery to Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Patients: A Qualitative Study."", 'Barriers and facilitators to healthy lifestyle and acceptability of a dietary and physical activity intervention among African Caribbean prostate cancer survivors in the UK: a qualitative study.', ""Health professionals' provision of lifestyle advice in the oncology context in the United Kingdom."", ""Stroke survivors' and family members' perspectives of multimodal lifestyle interventions for secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attack: a qualitative review and meta-aggregation."", 'The promotion of homebased physical activity for people with lung cancer and cachexia, a qualitative study of healthcare professionals, patients and carers.', 'Fatigue, quality of life and associations with adherence to the World Cancer Research Fund guidelines for health behaviours in 5835 adults living with and beyond breast, prostate and colorectal cancer in England: A cross-sectional study.', 'A qualitative study identifying challenges resulting from complex evidence on lifestyle factors and cancer: perspectives from Black and Latina cancer survivors and healthcare providers.', ""Modifiable Risk Factors, Health Profile and Well-Being of the Elderly Diagnosed with Cancer in Italy: Passi d'Argento Surveillance System 2016-2019 Results."", 'Co-designed weight management intervention for women recovering from oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.']"""

In this study, we investigated the adipose transcriptional profiles of low- and high-risk disease to determine both prognostic potential and possible biological drivers of aggressive disease. RNA was extracted from periprostatic adipose tissue from patients categorised as having prostate cancer with either a low or high risk of progression based on tumour characteristics at prostatectomy and profiled by RNA sequencing. The expression of selected genes was then quantified by qRT-PCR in a cross-validation cohort. In the first phase, a total of 677 differentially transcribed genes were identified, from which a subset of 14 genes was shortlisted. In the second phase, a 3 gene (IGHA1, OLFM4, RERGL) signature was refined and evaluated using recursive feature selection and cross-validation, obtaining a promising discriminatory utility (area under curve 0.72) at predicting the presence of high-risk disease. Genes implicated in immune and/or inflammatory responses predominated. Periprostatic adipose tissue from patients with high-risk prostate cancer has a distinct transcriptional signature that may be useful for detecting its occult presence. Differential expression appears to be driven by a local immune/inflammatory reaction to more advanced tumours, than any specific adipose tissue-specific tumour-promoting mechanism.

A meta-analysis of cancer SIRs from 23 studies (including the present one) was performed.  Results:   The cohort study identified 81 cases of cancer after exclusion of cases diagnosed within the first year [SIR 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9 to 1.4].

Despite a large food effect, AA was administered under fasting conditions in its pivotal trials. We sought to test the hypothesis that low-dose AA (LOW; 250 mg with a low-fat meal) would have comparable activity to standard AA (STD; 1,000 mg fasting) in patients with CRPC. Patients and Methods Patients (n = 72) with progressive CRPC from seven institutions in the United States and Singapore were randomly assigned to STD or LOW. Both arms received prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was assessed monthly, and testosterone/dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were assessed every 12 weeks with disease burden radiographic assessments. Plasma was collected for drug concentrations. Log change in PSA, as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for efficacy, was the primary end point, using a noninferiority design. Progression-free survival (PFS), PSA response (≥ 50% reduction), change in androgen levels, and pharmacokinetics were secondary end points. Results Thirty-six patients were accrued to both arms. At 12 weeks, there was a greater effect on PSA in the LOW arm (mean log change, -1.59) compared with STD (-1.19), and noninferiority of LOW was established according to predefined criteria. The PSA response rate was 58% in LOW and 50% in STD, and the median PFS was approximately 9 months in both groups. Androgen levels decreased similarly in both arms. Although there was no difference in PSA response or PFS, abiraterone concentrations were higher in STD. Conclusion Low-dose AA (with low-fat breakfast) is noninferior to standard dosing with respect to PSA metrics. Given the pharmacoeconomic implications, these data warrant consideration by prescribers, payers, and patients. Additional studies are indicated to assess the long-term efficacy of this approach.""","""['Russell Z Szmulewitz', 'Cody J Peer', 'Abiola Ibraheem', 'Elia Martinez', 'Mark F Kozloff', 'Bradley Carthon', 'R Donald Harvey', 'Paul Fishkin', 'Wei Peng Yong', 'Edmund Chiong', 'Chadi Nabhan', 'Theodore Karrison', 'William D Figg', 'Walter M Stadler', 'Mark J Ratain']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Low-Fat Abiraterone Food Effect Is of Little Consequence.', 'Low-Fat Abiraterone Food Effect Is of Great Consequence.', 'Reply to I.F.

As TRUS provides limited soft tissue contrast, segmenting the prostate gland in TRUS images is often challenging and subject to inter-observer and intra-observer variability, especially at the base and apex where the gland boundary is hard to define. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has higher soft tissue contrast allowing the prostate to be contoured easily. In this paper, we aim to show that prostate segmentation in TRUS images informed by MRI priors can improve on prostate segmentation that relies only on TRUS images.  Methods:   First, we compare the TRUS-based prostate segmentation used in the treatment of 598 patients with a high-quality MRI prostate atlas and observe inconsistencies at the apex and base. Second, motivated by this finding, we propose an alternative TRUS segmentation technique that is fully automatic and uses MRI priors. The algorithm uses a convolutional neural network to segment the prostate in TRUS images at mid-gland, where the gland boundary can be clearly seen. It then reconstructs the gland boundary at the apex and base with the aid of a statistical shape model built from an MRI atlas of 78 patients.  Results:   Compared to the clinical TRUS segmentation, our method achieves similar mid-gland segmentation results in the 598-patient database. For the seven patients who had both TRUS and MRI, our method achieved more accurate segmentation of the base and apex with the MRI segmentation used as ground truth.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that utilizing MRI priors in TRUS prostate segmentation could potentially improve the performance at base and apex.""","""['Qi Zeng', 'Golnoosh Samei', 'Davood Karimi', 'Claudia Kesch', 'Sara S Mahdavi', 'Purang Abolmaesumi', 'Septimiu E Salcudean']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Deformable registration of trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for focal prostate brachytherapy.', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Accuracy Validation of an Automated Method for Prostate Segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'MR-TRUS Fusion Biopsy.', 'Learning to segment fetal brain tissue from noisy annotations.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Domain generalization for prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound images: A multi-center study.', 'Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Prostate Cancer Patient Management-Current Trends and Future Perspectives.', 'Current status of deep learning applications in abdominal ultrasonography.']"""

TeUS is based on analyzing a sequence of ultrasound data with deep learning and has been demonstrated to be successful for detection of cancer in ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Our aim is to enable the dissemination of this technology to the community for large-scale clinical validation.  Methods:   In this paper, we present a unified software framework demonstrating near-real-time analysis of ultrasound data stream using a deep learning solution. The system integrates ultrasound imaging hardware, visualization and a deep learning back-end to build an accessible, flexible and robust platform. A client-server approach is used in order to run computationally expensive algorithms in parallel. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework using two applications as case studies. First, we show that prostate cancer detection using near-real-time analysis of RF and B-mode TeUS data and deep learning is feasible. Second, we present real-time segmentation of ultrasound prostate data using an integrated deep learning solution.  Results:   The system is evaluated for cancer detection accuracy on ultrasound data obtained from a large clinical study with 255 biopsy cores from 157 subjects. It is further assessed with an independent dataset with 21 biopsy targets from six subjects.

All subjects had a single biopsy-confirmed focus of Gleason ≥ 3+4 cancer. Two radiologists (readers 1 and 2) determined tumor boundaries based on in vivo mpMRI sequences, with clinical and pathologic data available. 18F-choline PET data were co-registered to T2-weighted 3D sequences and a semi-automatic segmentation routine was used to define tumor volumes. Registration of whole-mount surgical pathology to in vivo imaging was conducted utilizing two ex vivo prostate specimen MRIs, followed by gross sectioning of the specimens within a custom-made 3D-printed plastic mold. Overlap and similarity coefficients of manual segmentations (seg1, seg2) and 18F-choline-based segmented lesions (seg3) were compared to the pathologic reference standard.  Results:   All segmentation methods greatly underestimated the true tumor volumes. Human readers (seg1, seg2) and the PET-based segmentation (seg3) underestimated an average of 79, 80, and 58% of the tumor volumes, respectively. Combining segmentation volumes (union of seg1, seg2, seg3 = seg4) decreased the mean underestimated tumor volume to 42% of the true tumor volume. When using the combined segmentation with 5 mm contour expansion, the mean underestimated tumor volume was significantly reduced to 0.03 ± 0.05 mL (2.04 ± 2.84%). Substantial safety margins up to 11-15 mm were needed to include all tumors when the initial segmentation boundaries were drawn by human readers or the semi-automated 18F-choline segmentation tool. Combining MR-based human segmentations with the metabolic information based on 18F-choline PET reduced the necessary safety margin to a maximum of 9 mm to cover all tumors entirely.  Conclusions:   To improve the outcome of focal therapies for significant prostate cancer, it is imperative to recognize the full extent of the underestimation of tumor volumes by mpMRI. Combining metabolic information from 18F-choline with MRI-based segmentation can improve tumor coverage. However, this approach requires confirmation in further clinical studies.""","""['Morand Piert', 'Prasad R Shankar', 'Jeffrey Montgomery', 'Lakshmi Priya Kunju', 'Virginia Rogers', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Thekkelnaycke Rajendiran', 'Jason Hearn', 'Arvin George', 'Xia Shao', 'Matthew S Davenport']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['18F-Choline PET/MRI: The Additional Value of PET for MRI-Guided Transrectal Prostate Biopsies.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Introducing parametric fusion PET/MRI of primary prostate cancer.', 'Multi-parametric MRI imaging of the prostate-implications for focal therapy.', 'Prostate Cancer Academy 2019 Selected Summaries.', 'Real-Time MRI-Guided Prostate Interventions.', 'Future perspective of focal therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Automated detection of aggressive and indolent prostate cancer on magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Prostate cancer GTV delineation with biparametric MRI and 68Ga-PSMA-PET: comparison of expert contours and semi-automated methods.', 'ProsRegNet: A deep learning framework for registration of MRI and histopathology images of the prostate.']"""

We aimed to identify patients with high-risk PCa who are treatable by RP alone.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data on 315 patients with D'Amico high-risk PCa who were treated using RP without neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy at the institutions of the Yamaguchi Uro-Oncology Group between 2009 and 2013. The primary endpoint was biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) after RP. Risk factors for biochemical progression were extracted using the Cox proportional hazard model. We stratified the patients with high-risk PCa into 3 subgroups based on bPFS after RP using the risk factors.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 49.9 months, biochemical progression was observed in 20.5% of the patients. The 2- and 5-year bPFS after RP were 89.4 and 70.0%, respectively.

Unfortunately, most prostate cancers eventually become androgen-independent and resistant to ADT with patients progressing to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Constitutively activated AR variants (AR-V) have emerged as mediators of resistance to AR-targeted therapy and the progression of mCRPC, and they represent an important therapeutic target. Out of at least 15 AR-Vs described thus far, AR-V7 is the most abundant, and its expression correlates with ADT resistance. ONC201/TIC10 is the founding member of the imipridone class of small molecules and has shown anticancer activity in a broad range of tumor types. ONC201 is currently being tested in phase I/II clinical trials for advanced solid tumors, including mCRPC, and hematologic malignancies. There has been promising activity observed in patients in early clinical testing. This study demonstrates preclinical single-agent efficacy of ONC201 using in vitro and in vivo models of prostate cancer. ONC201 has potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in both castration-resistant and -sensitive prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that ONC201 downregulates the expression of key drivers of prostate cancer such as AR-V7 and downstream target genes including the clinically used biomarker PSA (KLK3). Finally, the data also provide a preclinical rationale for combination of ONC201 with approved therapeutics for prostate cancer such as enzalutamide, everolimus (mTOR inhibitor), or docetaxel.Implications: The preclinical efficacy of ONC201 as a single agent or in combination, in hormone-sensitive or castration-resistant prostate cancer, suggests the potential for immediate clinical translation.

Inflammation has further been suggested to be involved in prostate cancer development. We therefore hypothesized that immunological characteristics signaled by appendicitis before late adolescence might influence the risk of later prostate cancer, and aimed to evaluate this association in a population-based study.Methods: We identified a large cohort of Swedish men who underwent assessment for military conscription around the age of 18 years (n = 242,573). Medical diagnoses at time of conscription were available through the Swedish Military Conscription Register. The Swedish Cancer Register was used to identify diagnoses of prostate cancer. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression analyses were used to estimate HR and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association between appendicitis and prostate cancer.Results: During a median of 36.7 years of follow-up, 1,684 diagnoses of prostate cancer occurred. We found a statistically significant association between appendicitis and overall prostate cancer (adjusted HR 1.70; 95% CI, 1.08-2.67). The risk was notably increased for advanced (HR 4.42; 95% CI, 1.74-11.22) and lethal (HR 8.95; 95% CI, 2.98-26.91) prostate cancer.Conclusions: These results suggest that a diagnosis of appendicitis before adulthood potentially signals underlying immune characteristics and a pattern of inflammatory response relevant to prostate cancer risk.Impact: The study lends support to the proposed role of inflammation in prostate carcinogenesis, and adds another area of investigation potentially relevant to prostate cancer development.

Nine patients died, none of PCa. No patient has metastases or castrate-resistance. At 10 years, OS and CSS were 90.4% (p = 0.25) and 100%.  Conclusions:   Dose-escalated prostate SABR was associated with lower nPSAs but no difference in BF, OS, CSS or MFS. PSA <0.4 at 4 years was a predictor of biochemical control. Half of patients with BF were successfully salvaged. Given that this is a favorable-risk cohort, longer follow-up will be needed to see if the lower nPSA translates into lower BF rates.""","""['Yasir Alayed', 'Patrick Cheung', 'Geordi Pang', 'Alexandre Mamedov', ""Laura D'Alimonte"", 'Andrea Deabreu', 'Kristina Commisso', 'Angela Commisso', 'Liang Zhang', 'Harvey C Quon', 'Hima Bindu Musunuru', 'Joelle Helou', 'D Andrew Loblaw']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['SABR in High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Outcomes From 2 Prospective Clinical Trials With and Without Elective Nodal Irradiation.', 'Multi-Institutional Analysis of Prostate-Specific Antigen Kinetics After Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.', 'Two StereoTactic ablative radiotherapy treatments for localized prostate cancer (2STAR): Results from a prospective clinical trial.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Clinical trials of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for prostate cancer: updates and future direction.', 'Radiobiological Meta-Analysis of the Response of Prostate Cancer to Different Fractionations: Evaluation of the Linear-Quadratic Response at Large Doses and the Effect of Risk and ADT.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Intrafraction Prostate Motion and Interfraction Anatomical Changes in Dose-Escalated Linac-Based SBRT.', 'Stereotactic Radiation Therapy versus Brachytherapy: Relative Strengths of Two Highly Efficient Options for the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Quality-of-Life Outcomes and Toxic Effects Among Patients With Cancers of the Uterus Treated With Stereotactic Pelvic Adjuvant Radiation Therapy: The SPARTACUS Phase 1/2 Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.', 'Dose-Intensified Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

The most recent developments in heterodimer-based radiopharmaceuticals concern BB2- and integrin αvβ3-targeting compounds, consisting of bombesin (BBN) and cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptides (RGD), connected through short length linkers. Molecular imaging probes based on RGD-BBN heterodimer design exhibit improved tumor targeting efficacy compared to the single-receptor targeting peptide monomers. However, their application in clinical study is restricted because of inefficient synthesis or unfavorable in vivo properties, which could depend on the short linker nature. Thus, the aim of the present study was to develop a RGD2-BBN heterotrimer, composed of (7-14)BBN-NH2 peptide (BBN) linked to the E[ c(RGDyK)]2 dimer peptide (RGD2), bearing the new linker type [Pro-Gly]12. The heterodimer E[c(RGDyK)]2-PEG3-Glu-(Pro-Gly)12-BBN(7-14)-NH2 (RGD2-PG12-BBN) was prepared through conventional solid phase synthesis, then conjugated with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) or 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1-glutaric acid-4,7-diacetic acid (NODA-GA). In 64Cu labeling, the NODA-GA chelator showed superior radiochemical characteristics compared to DOTA (70% vs 40% yield, respectively). Both conjugates displayed dual targeting ability, showing good αvβ3 affinities and high BB2 receptor affinities which, in the case of the NODA-GA conjugate, were in the same range as the best RGD-BBN heterodimer ligands reported to date ( Ki = 24 nM). 64Cu-DOTA and 64Cu-NODA-GA probes were also found to be stable after 1 h incubation in mouse serum (>90%). In a microPET study in prostate cancer PC-3 xenograft mice, both probes showed low tumor uptake, probably due to poor pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Overall, our study demonstrates that novel RGD-BBN heterodimer with long linker can be prepared and they preserve high binding affinities to BB2 and integrin αvβ3 receptor binding ability. The present study represents a step forward in the design of effective heterodimer or heterotrimer probes for dual targeting.""","""['Ermelinda Lucente', 'Hongguang Liu', 'Yang Liu', 'Xiang Hu', 'Enza Lacivita', 'Marcello Leopoldo', 'Zhen Cheng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['64Cu-NO2A-RGD-Glu-6-Ahx-BBN(7-14)NH2: a heterodimeric targeting vector for positron emission tomography imaging of prostate cancer.', 'A new 18F-labeled BBN-RGD peptide heterodimer with a symmetric linker for prostate cancer imaging.', 'A heterodimeric RGD-Glu-(64)Cu-NO2A-6-Ahx-RM2 αvβ3/GRPr-targeting antagonist radiotracer for PET imaging of prostate tumors.', '64Cu-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid-c(RGDyK)-Glu-6-aminohexanoic acid-bombesin7-14NH2.', '68Ga-1,4,7-Triazacyclononane-1,4-7-triacetic acid-Glu-c(RGDyK)-bombesin7-14.', 'Multifunctional self-assembled peptide nanoparticles for multimodal imaging-guided enhanced theranostic applications against glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Radionuclide-Based Imaging of Breast Cancer: State of the Art.', 'Effect of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy in Combination with Temozolomide against Tumor Angiogenesis in a Glioblastoma Model.', 'Hybridization of tumor homing and mitochondria-targeting peptide domains to design novel dual-imaging self-assembled peptide nanoparticles for theranostic applications.', 'Advances in Development of Radiometal Labeled Amino Acid-Based Compounds for Cancer Imaging and Diagnostics.']"""

However, the expression, function and clinical significance of SRPK2 in prostate cancer (PCa) has not yet been understood. We therefore aimed to determine the association of SRPK2 with tumor progression and metastasis in PCa patients in our present study. The expression of SRPK2 was detected by some public datasets and validated using a clinical tissue microarray (TMA) by immunohistochemistry. The association of SRPK2 expression with various clinicopathological characteristics of PCa patients was subsequently statistically analyzed based on the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and clinical TMA. The effects of SRPK2 on cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and tumor growth were then respectively investigated using in vitro and in vivo experiments. First, public datasets showed that SRPK2 expression was greater in PCa tissues when compared with non-cancerous tissues. Statistical analysis demonstrated that high expression of SRPK2 was significantly correlated with a higher Gleason Score, advanced pathological stage and the presence of tumor metastasis in the TCGA Dataset (all P < 0.01). Similar correlations between SRPK2 and a higher Gleason Score or advanced pathological stage were also identified in the TMA (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier curve analyses showed that the biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free time of PCa patients with SRPK2 high expression was shorter than for those with SRPK2 low expression (P < 0.05). Second, cell function experiments in PCa cell lines revealed that enhanced SRPK2 expression could promote cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cell cycle progression but suppress tumor cell apoptosis in vitro. Xenograft experiments showed that SRPK2 promoted tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that SRPK2 may play an important role in the progression and metastasis of PCa, which suggests that it might be a potential therapeutic target for PCa clinical therapy.""","""['Yang Jia Zhuo', 'Ze Zhen Liu', 'Song Wan', 'Zhi Duan Cai', 'Jian Jiang Xie', 'Zhou da Cai', 'Sheng da Song', 'Yue Ping Wan', 'Wei Hua', 'Wei de Zhong', 'Chin Lee Wu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['High expression of ASPM correlates with tumor progression and predicts poor outcome in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Enhanced expression of centromere protein F predicts clinical progression and prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Decreased expression of serine protease inhibitor family G1 (SERPING1) in prostate cancer can help distinguish high-risk prostate cancer and predicts malignant progression.', 'Advances of Zinc Signaling Studies in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Tumor Microenvironments of Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'SRPKs: a promising therapeutic target in cancer.', 'Impaired expression of serine/arginine protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) affects melanoma progression.', 'The novel transcriptomic signature of angiogenesis predicts clinical outcome, tumor microenvironment and treatment response for prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Unravelling the Role of Kinases That Underpin Androgen Signalling in Prostate Cancer.', 'In leukemia, knock-down of the death inducer-obliterator gene would inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells by inhibiting the expression of CDK6 and CCND1.']"""

However, existing methods of EVs isolation have low efficiency, purity, and long process time, and therefore have low diagnostic ability. To solve these the problems, a two-phase system is adapted to isolate EVs from a patient's urine. Urine from 20 prostate cancer (PCA) patients and 10 benign prostate hyperplasia patients was used to quantify the EVs-isolation ability of an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) and to compare the diagnostic ability of ATPS with that of the conventional diagnosis method. An optimized ATPS isolates EVs with ~100% efficiency within ~30 min, with 14 times as high as achieved by ultracentrifugation. Afterward, PCR and ELISA are used to detect EVs derived from PCA cells in urine. The results demonstrate that diagnostic ability based on ATPS is better than other conventional diagnostic methods. ATPS can obtain a high quality and quantity of EVs from patients' urine. EVs contain cancer-related protein and genes, so these abundant sources enable diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity.

Methods:   MCC-Spain is a multicase-control study that collected information of 1629 incident cases of CRC and 3509 population-based controls from 11 Spanish provinces. Western, Prudent and Mediterranean data-driven dietary patterns-derived in another Spanish case-control study-were reconstructed in MCC-Spain. Their association with CRC was assessed using mixed multivariable logistic regression models considering a possible interaction with sex. Risk by tumor site (proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum) was evaluated using multinomial regression models.  Results:   While no effect of the Prudent pattern on CRC risk was observed, a high adherence to the Western dietary pattern was associated with increased CRC risk for both males [ORfourth(Q4) vs. first(Q1)quartile (95% CI): 1.45 (1.11;1.91)] and females [ORQ4 vs. Q1 (95% CI): 1.50 (1.07;2.09)] but seem to be confined to distal colon [ORfourth(Q4) vs. first(Q1)quartile (95% CI): 2.02 (1.44;2.84)] and rectal [ORQ4 vs. Q1 (95% CI): 1.46 (1.05;2.01)] tumors.

To determine the mechanism by which ERG overexpression and PTEN loss leads to transformation, we overexpressed the TE fusion gene and knocked down PTEN in an immortalized but non-transformed prostate epithelial cell line. We show that ERG overexpression in combination with PTEN loss can transform these immortalized but non-tumorigenic cells, while either alteration alone was not sufficient to fully transform these cells. Expression microarray analysis revealed extensive changes in gene expression in cells expressing the TE fusion with loss of PTEN. Among these gene expression changes was increased expression of multiple FGF ligands and receptors. We show that activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling plays a key role in transformation induced by TE fusion gene expression in association with PTEN loss. In addition, in vitro and in silico analysis reveals PTEN loss is associated with widespread increases in FGF ligands and receptors in prostate cancer.

This study analyzed the association between Paxillin expression in prostate cancer (PCa) tissues with clinicopathological features, lymph node metastasis and biochemical PCa recurrence. Methods A total of 386 tissue specimens from PCa patients who received radical prostatectomy and 60 tissue specimens from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) cases were collected to construct tissue microarrays, which were subsequently immunostained for Paxillin expression. Thirty positive lymph node tissue specimens and 10 healthy prostate tissue specimens were randomly selected for Paxillin immunostaining. Results The association between Paxillin expression, lymph node metastasis and biochemical PCa recurrence was analyzed. Paxillin expression was significantly higher in PCa than both normal and BPH tissues (P<0.001) and was correlated with preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, clinical tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, positive surgical margin, extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion (P<0.05 for all). Logistic regression analysis showed that Paxillin and Gleason score were independent risk factors for PCa lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated that Paxillin expression (AUC=0.723) more accurately predicted PCa lymph node metastasis than Gleason score (AUC=0.692).

Recent studies have shown that H19 enhances cancer invasion and metastasis; however, its roles in cancer remain controversial. In the current study, H19 exhibited the second largest increase (82.4-fold) and represented the only non-protein coding gene among 11 genes identified that were elevated over 10-fold in lung-metastasis-derived pancreatic cancer cells compared with their parental cells using a mouse metastatic model. Subsequently, we further clarified the roles of H19 in pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis using in vitro and in vivo techniques. In situ hybridization showed that H19 was detected in 23 of 139 invasive ductal carcinomas (17%), and that H19 expression positively correlated with higher histological grades (P < 0.0001). Overexpression of H19 in PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells induced higher motilities, whereas H19 inhibition using shRNA and siRNA showed opposite results; however, cell growth rates were not impacted. Intravenous injection of H19 shRNA vector-transfected PANC-1 cells yielded marked inhibition of metastasis in the liver and lungs of immunodeficient mice.

Here, we report PIK3CA mutation/amplification correlates with poor survival of patients with prostate cancer. To interrogate the requirement of different PI3K genetic drivers in prostate cancer, we employed a genetic approach to mutate Pik3ca in mouse prostate epithelium. We show Pik3caH1047R mutation causes p110α-dependent invasive prostate carcinoma in vivo Furthermore, we report that PIK3CA mutation and PTEN loss coexist in patients with prostate cancer and can cooperate in vivo to accelerate disease progression via AKT-mTORC1/2 hyperactivation. Contrasting single mutants that slowly acquire castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), concomitant Pik3ca mutation and Pten loss caused de novo CRPC. Thus, Pik3ca mutation and Pten deletion are not functionally redundant. Our findings indicate that PIK3CA mutation is an attractive prognostic indicator for prostate cancer that may cooperate with PTEN loss to facilitate CRPC in patients.Significance: We show PIK3CA mutation correlates with poor prostate cancer prognosis and causes prostate cancer in mice.

New objective methods of predicting overall survival would be beneficial for surgical decision making. Morphometrics quantifies patient frailty and has been successfully used to predict overall survival in patients with lung cancer spinal metastases. This study evaluated whether morphometrics can predict survival in patients with prostate cancer spinal metastases.  Methods:   Using a retrospective registry of patients with spinal metastases who underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy, we identified patients with primary prostate cancer. Morphometric measurements of the psoas muscle were taken from most recent lumbar spine computed tomography. Patients were stratified into lowest, middle, and highest tertiles based on psoas muscle area. Primary outcome measure was overall survival from the date of computed tomography scan.  Results:   We identified 92 patients. Median survival for all patients was 124 days (95% confidence interval, 98-197 days). Patients in the smallest third for average psoas size had significantly shorter survival compared with patients in the largest third: 117 days versus 302 days (hazard ratio 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-4.43; P = 0.004). Patients in the middle third for average psoas size also had shorter survival compared with patients in the largest third: 113 days versus 302 days (hazard ratio 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-4.25; P = 0.007).  Conclusions:   In patients with prostate cancer spinal metastases, morphometric analysis of psoas muscle size can identify patients at risk for shorter survival.

The present study was aimed to determinate the effect of an educational program for prostate cancer prevention on knowledge and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in men over 50 years old in community areas of Shiraz. Methods: This clinical trial was conducted among 93 men over 50 years old who were randomly divided into an intervention (n=48) and a control (n=45) group. The intervention group took part in an educational program focusing on the importance of prostate cancer prevention with emphasis on cultural and economic issues. Data were collected using a demographic information form, the Weinrich questionnaire for measuring the knowledge level about prostate cancer and screening, and also a researcher-made questionnaire covering reasons for not doing the test, before and 3 months after the intervention. Additionally, participation in PSA testing was evaluated 3 months after the intervention. All data were entered into the SPSS statistical software (version 14) and p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Findings: The results showed that the intervention group’s participation in PSA testing increased from 6.12% to 36.4% three months after the intervention. However, no significant change was observed in the control group. In addition, the intervention group’s mean score of knowledge increased by about 2.69 points after the intervention, and a significant difference was observed between the two groups in this regard (p<0.05). Conclusion: The results of the current study revealed effectiveness of the educational program in increasing the knowledge about prostate cancer and participation in PSA testing in men over 50 years of age. Hence, managers and authorities should execute plans to educate men regarding prostate cancer screening and promote their health status.""","""['Zahra Molazem', 'Mehdi Ebadi', 'Mohammad Khademian', 'Reza Zare']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""[""Informed decision making and prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer: a randomised controlled trial exploring the impact of a brief patient decision aid on men's knowledge, attitudes and intention to be tested."", 'Do Men Receive Information Required for Shared Decision Making About PSA Testing?

There have been few studies of de novo solid organ malignancy (NSOM) after pancreas-kidney transplantation (PKT). The aim of this study was analyze the prevalence of NSOM and transplant outcomes.  Methods:   We studied the development of NSOM after PKT in our center from May 1990 to February 2017. We analyzed demographic characteristics, prevalence of cancer, and survival after cancer diagnosis. We excluded nonmelanoma skin cancer and patients with history of malignancy before transplantation.  Results:   We included 194 patients who received 206 PKTs (184 simultaneous PKTs and 22 pancreas after kidney transplants) with triple immunosuppressive therapy and basiliximab in more than 95%. The mean age at transplantation was 39 ± 7 years and 74% were male patients. Twelve patients developed malignancies (6.1%). Median time from transplant to NSOM was 6.6 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.2-11.7) years. The malignancies were 2 cecal appendix tumors, 2 hematologic tumors, 2 breast tumors, 1 melanoma, 1 native kidney tumor, 1 brain tumor, 1 bladder tumor, 1 prostate tumor, and 1 leiomyosarcoma. Thirty-five of the 194 patients of the whole cohort died throughout the follow-up, 4 of whom died after NSOM diagnosis (11.4%). Patient and grafts survivals were lower in recipients with tumor compared with recipients without tumor, but the difference was not statistically significant: renal graft survival was 80% vs 90% at 10 years (P = .86); and pancreatic graft survival was 45% vs 70% at 10 years (P = .15), respectively. The mean patient survival time from the diagnosis of cancer was 36.6 (IQR 18-54) months. Patient survival after NSOM diagnosis was 90% at 1 year and 50% at 5 years.  Conclusion:   The prevalence of NSOM in our PKT recipients is low, despite the scarce series of published data for comparison. Also hematologic tumors rate is very low, possibly influenced by age and type of induction.""","""['M V Pendón-Ruiz de Mier', 'M L Agüera', 'M D Navarro', 'A Rodriguez-Benot', 'P Aljama']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Transplant Proc""","""['De Novo Malignant Neoplasms in Renal Transplant Patients.', 'Incidence and Long-Term Prognosis of Cancer After Kidney Transplantation.', 'Pancreas graft survival in simultaneous pancreas-kidney versus pancreas-after-kidney and pancreas alone transplantations: a single institution experience.', 'Mixed Donor Chimerism Following Simultaneous Pancreas-Kidney Transplant.', 'Simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation.', 'Post-Transplant Malignancies following Pancreas Transplantation: Incidence and Implications on Long-Term Outcome from a Single-Center Perspective.', 'CAV2 promotes the growth of renal cell carcinoma through the EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway.']"""
