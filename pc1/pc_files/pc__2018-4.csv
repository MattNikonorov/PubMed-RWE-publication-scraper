However, normal cells can also secrete exosomes, so it is a prerequisite to obtain tumor-derived exosomes for better understanding of their diagnostic impacts in cancer. In this study, a dual-antibody-functionalized immunoaffinity system was established to isolate exosomes and investigate their lncRNAs expression pattern and clinical significance in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   A commercially available kit was used to isolate total exosomes, which were then purified by a dual-antibody-functionalized immunoaffinity system. RT-qPCR was performed to detect the expression of exosomal lncRNAs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to assess the diagnostic value.  Results:   Expression levels of two lncRNAs in tumor-derived exosomes were significantly higher than those in total exosomes. The levels of SAP30L-AS1 were upregulated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and SChLAP1 levels were significantly higher in PCa than in BPH and healthy individuals. The area under the ROC curve indicated that SAP30L-AS1 and SChLAP1 had adequate diagnostic value to distinguish PCa from controls. Two lncRNAs separately combined with prostate specific antigen (PSA) possessed a moderate ability for discrimination. SAP30L-AS1 expression level was related to PSA values and tumor invasion. SChLAP1 expression was significantly higher in patients with higher Gleason scores, and was also effective in differentiating between BPH and PCa when the concentration of PSA was in the gray zone.  Conclusion:   The isolation of tumor-derived exosomes by dual-antibody-functionalized immunoaffinity systems and detection of their lncRNAs in plasma may lead to the identification of suitable biomarkers, with potential diagnostic utility.""","""['Yu-Hui Wang', 'Jia Ji', 'Bi-Cheng Wang', 'Hao Chen', 'Zhong-Hua Yang', 'Kun Wang', 'Chang-Liang Luo', 'Wu-Wen Zhang', 'Fu-Bing Wang', 'Xiao-Lian Zhang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['Urinary microRNA-based signature improves accuracy of detection of clinically relevant prostate cancer within the prostate-specific antigen grey zone.', 'Exosome-transmitted long non-coding RNA PTENP1 suppresses bladder cancer progression.', 'Preliminary study on the diagnostic value of serum-derived exosomal lncRNA in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Clinical prospects of long noncoding RNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'The functional roles of exosomal long non-coding RNAs in cancer.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle nucleic acids as promising diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Liquid Biopsies, Novel Approaches and Future Directions.', 'Research advances and challenges in tissue-derived extracellular vesicles.', 'Exosomal miRNAs-a diagnostic biomarker acting as a guiding light in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'An exosome-related long non-coding RNAs risk model could predict survival outcomes in patients with breast cancer.']"""

The plastic extracellular domain of the protein binds to extracellular matrix proteins and plasma membrane proteins, changing cell-cell interactions and generating intracellular signals that influence cell behavior. αvβ3 also contains a receptor for thyroid hormone and derivatives, including tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac).  Materials and methods:   Human prostate cancer (PC3) cells were engrafted in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane model. The well-vascularized spheroidal xenografts were exposed to X-radiation in varying dosages (1-10 Gy) and in the presence and absence of an antibody that recognizes unliganded human β3 integrin monomer in the extended or open (activated) configuration.  Results:   Radiation significantly increased activated β3 within 1 h (P < .001), a radiation response not previously reported. Incubation of cells with unmodified tetrac or tetrac covalently linked to a nanoparticle (Nanotetrac, NDAT) did not change basal activation state of the integrin monomer, but prevented radiation-induced activation of β3.  Conclusions:   Activation of the integrin in response to radiation is interpreted as a defensive response, perhaps leading to increased intercellular affinity and inhibition of cell division, a radioresistant state. Action of NDAT indicates that pharmacologic interventions in the radiation response of integrin β3 monomer and therefore of αvβ3 are feasible.""","""['John T Leith', 'Aleck Hercbergs', 'Susan Kenney', 'Shaker A Mousa', 'Paul J Davis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Endocr Res""","""['Tetraiodothyroacetic acid and its nanoformulation inhibit thyroid hormone stimulation of non-small cell lung cancer cells in vitro and its growth in xenografts.', 'Tetraiodothyroacetic acid, a small molecule integrin ligand, blocks angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor.', 'Pharmacokinetics, Biodistribution, and Anti-Angiogenesis Efficacy of Diamino Propane Tetraiodothyroacetic Acid-conjugated Biodegradable Polymeric Nanoparticle.', 'Cancer Cell Gene Expression Modulated from Plasma Membrane Integrin αvβ3 by Thyroid Hormone and Nanoparticulate Tetrac.', 'Identification and functions of the plasma membrane receptor for thyroid hormone analogues.', 'In Vivo Clearance of Apoptotic Debris From Tumor Xenografts Exposed to Chemically Modified Tetrac: Is There a Role for Thyroid Hormone Analogues in Efferocytosis?', 'Actions of Thyroid Hormones on Thyroid Cancers.', 'Cancer-Associated Thrombosis: Risk Factors, Molecular Mechanisms, Future Management.', 'Actions of L-thyroxine (T4) and Tetraiodothyroacetic Acid (Tetrac) on Gene Expression in Thyroid Cancer Cells.', 'Platelet ATP, Thyroid Hormone Receptor on Integrin αvβ3 and Cancer Metastasis.']"""

It may represent one of the key points for a tailored treatment planning. Along these lines, we used a novel software for augmented-reality robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (AR-RARP) at our Institution. 3D virtual models of the prostate and the prostate cancer were reconstructed from high resolution (1-mm slices) multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mp-MRI) by M3dics (Turin, Italy). The innovation in the study is represented by the software-based integration of the virtual model inside the Da Vinci (Intuitive, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) robotic console during robotic prostatectomy. In January 2018, the above-described AR-RARP technique has been used during the live surgery sessions of the 6th Techno-Urology Meeting held at San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital (Orbassano, Turin, Italy). During this meeting, 6 experienced robotic surgeons (who have already performed more than 1000 RARP) used the software during nerve-sparing prostatectomy. The use of the technology was standardized to four key steps during the procedure: 1) bladder neck dissection; 2) nerve-sparing technique; 3) apex dissection; and 4) tailoring of eventual selective biopsies of prostatic lodge after prostatectomy). A Face Validity questionnaire was purpose-built aimed to collect the expert surgeons' insights about the eventual help of the technology in guiding the surgeon during the above-described AR-RARP steps. It was administered at the end of the surgeries to the respective surgeons. The questionnaire was made of open-ended questions of ordinal ten-point rating Likert Scale (where 1 corresponded to a strongly negative opinion and 10 to a strongly positive opinion). The median value of Likert scale from the evaluation of each of the aforementioned steps of AR-RARP was 9, (IQR 9-10). These findings are a confirmation of the increasing interest for a new-generation of image-guided surgery. Particularly, AR-RARP seems to be a step in the direction of ""precision"" surgery.""","""['Francesco Porpiglia', 'Riccardo Bertolo', 'Daniele Amparore', 'Enrico Checcucci', 'Walter Artibani', 'Prokar Dasgupta', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Ashutosh Tewari', 'Cristian Fiori;ESUT']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Minerva Urol Nefrol""","""['Augmented-reality robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using hyper-accuracy three-dimensional reconstruction (HA3D™) technology: a radiological and pathological study.', 'Augmented Reality Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Preliminary Experience.', 'Three-dimensional Elastic Augmented-reality Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Using Hyperaccuracy Three-dimensional Reconstruction Technology: A Step Further in the Identification of Capsular Involvement.', 'Methods for training of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'New Generation of 3D Virtual Models with Perfusional Zones: Perioperative Assistance for the Best Pedicle Management during Robotic Partial Nephrectomy.', 'Prostate MRI for Improving Personalized Risk Prediction of Incontinence and Surgical Planning: The Role of Membranous Urethral Length Measurements and the Use of 3D Models.', 'Nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Current perspectives.', '3D imaging applications for robotic urologic surgery: an ESUT YAUWP review.']"""

Patients and methods:   The patients included in this study were taken from the randomised trial (number 5) carried out by the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (SPCG), comparing parenteral oestrogen with total androgen blockade (TAB) in hormone-naïve M1b prostate cancer. We identified 597 men where Hb measurements were made at enrolment, as well as at 3, 6 and 12 months of ADT. The time-dependent impact of Hb concentration changes on overall survival (OS) was analysed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis. The 10-year OS according to increase/decrease in Hb concentration for the three treatment periods was demonstrated using Kaplan-Meier curves.  Results:   Multivariate analysis of changes in Hb concentration between baseline and 3 months showed better survival in patients with a decrease in Hb concentration (hazard ratio [HR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.80) compared to those with an increase, whilst there was no difference in survival associated with a change in Hb concentration between 3 and 6 months (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.12). Contrary to the first 3 months, poorer survival was seen in patients with a decrease in Hb concentration between 6 and 12 months (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62-0.92) compared to those with an increase.  Conclusions:   In a large cohort of Scandinavian men with hormone-naïve M1b prostate cancer, an increase in Hb concentration between baseline and 3 months of ADT was associated with significantly poorer survival, whereas an increase between 6 and 12 months was associated with better survival. These findings provide new information about patterns of change in Hb concentrations during 12 months of ADT for M1b prostate cancer, and survival.

However, because of the low, soft tissue contrast of CT images, manual segmentation of the prostate is a time-consuming task with high interobserver variation. In this study, we proposed a semiautomated, three-dimensional (3D) segmentation for prostate CT images using shape and texture analysis and we evaluated the method against manual reference segmentations.  Methods:   The prostate gland usually has a globular shape with a smoothly curved surface, and its shape could be accurately modeled or reconstructed having a limited number of well-distributed surface points. In a training dataset, using the prostate gland centroid point as the origin of a coordination system, we defined an intersubject correspondence between the prostate surface points based on the spherical coordinates. We applied this correspondence to generate a point distribution model for prostate shape using principal component analysis and to study the local texture difference between prostate and nonprostate tissue close to the different prostate surface subregions. We used the learned shape and texture characteristics of the prostate in CT images and then combined them with user inputs to segment a new image. We trained our segmentation algorithm using 23 CT images and tested the algorithm on two sets of 10 nonbrachytherapy and 37 postlow dose rate brachytherapy CT images. We used a set of error metrics to evaluate the segmentation results using two experts' manual reference segmentations.  Results:   For both nonbrachytherapy and post-brachytherapy image sets, the average measured Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was 88% and the average mean absolute distance (MAD) was 1.9 mm. The average measured differences between the two experts on both datasets were 92% (DSC) and 1.1 mm (MAD).  Conclusions:   The proposed, semiautomatic segmentation algorithm showed a fast, robust, and accurate performance for 3D prostate segmentation of CT images, specifically when no previous, intrapatient information, that is, previously segmented images, was available. The accuracy of the algorithm is comparable to the best performance results reported in the literature and approaches the interexpert variability observed in manual segmentation.""","""['Maysam Shahedi', 'Martin Halicek', 'Rongrong Guo', 'Guoyi Zhang', 'David M Schuster', 'Baowei Fei']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A semiautomatic algorithm for three-dimensional segmentation of the prostate on CT images using shape and local texture characteristics.', 'A semiautomatic approach for prostate segmentation in MR images using local texture classification and statistical shape modeling.', 'Spatially varying accuracy and reproducibility of prostate segmentation in magnetic resonance images using manual and semiautomated methods.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Muscle Segmentation for Orthopedic Interventions.', 'Semi-Automatic Prostate Segmentation From Ultrasound Images Using Machine Learning and Principal Curve Based on Interpretable Mathematical Model Expression.', 'Technical note: The effect of image annotation with minimal manual interaction for semiautomatic prostate segmentation in CT images using fully convolutional neural networks.', 'Incorporating minimal user input into deep learning based image segmentation.', 'Reproducibility of semiautomated body composition segmentation of abdominal computed tomography: a multiobserver study.', 'Deep learning-based three-dimensional segmentation of the prostate on computed tomography images.']"""

Methods:   A sample of 80 clinical plans of prostate cancer patients were ranked on the basis of the Adjusted Plan Quality Metric (APQM%). This quality metric was computed normalizing the Plan Quality Metric (PQM%) score to the best possible OAR sparing estimated by the Feasibility DVH (FDVH) algorithm. Two different plan libraries were created, purging all the plans below the first quartile or below the median the APQM% distribution. These libraries were used to populate and train two RapidPlan models: respectively, the APMQ25% and the APMQ50% models. No further refinements or actions were undertaken on these two models. Their performances were benchmarked against another two RapidPlan models. An Uncleaned model, which was populated and trained with the initial sample of 80 plans, and a Cleaned model, obtained through the standard iterative cleaning and refinement process suggested by the vendor and in literature. The outcomes of a planning test based on 20 patients within the training library (closed loop) and 20 patients outside of the training library (open-loop) were compared through various DVH metrics and the PQM% score.  Results:   The selection through APQM% thresholding roughly preserves the geometric variety of the Cleaned model; only the APMQ50% model showed a modest broadness reduction. The models generated through APQM% thresholding showed target coverage and OARs sparing equal or superior to the Uncleaned and Cleaned models both for the closed- and the open-loop tests. No significant differences were found between the four models. PQM% analysis ranked the overall plan quality as: 86.5 ± 6.5% APQM50% , 83.1 ± 5.9% APQM25% , 80.39 ± 10.6% Cleaned and 79.4 ± 8.5% Uncleaned in the closed-loop test; 84.9 ± 7.6% APQM50% , 82.6 ± 7.9% APQM25% , 80.39 ± 10.6% Cleaned and 79.4 ± 8.5% Uncleaned in the open-loop test.  Conclusions:   Forward feeding a RapidPlan model through a thresholding selection based on APQM% is proven to produce equal or better results than a model based on a manually and iteratively refined population. A tighter APQM% threshold turns approximately into a higher average quality of plans generated with RapidPlan. A trade-off must be found between the mean quality of the KBP library and its numerosity. The proposed KBP feeding method helps the KBP user, because it makes the model refinement more intuitive and less time consuming.""","""['Marco Fusella', 'Alessandro Scaggion', 'Nicola Pivato', 'Marco Andrea Rossato', 'Alessandra Zorz', 'Marta Paiusco']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Can knowledge-based DVH predictions be used for automated, individualized quality assurance of radiotherapy treatment plans?', 'Clinical validation and benchmarking of knowledge-based IMRT and VMAT treatment planning in pelvic anatomy.', 'Reducing inter- and intra-planner variability in radiotherapy plan output with a commercial knowledge-based planning solution.', 'Can the Student Outperform the Master?

Methods:   To study lung interplay, eight VMAT plans (1-6 arcs) and four-nine-field sliding-window IMRT plans varying in complexity were created. For the breast plans, four-four-field sliding-window IMRT plans were created. Using the Halcyon 1.0 linear accelerator, each plan was delivered five times each under sinusoidal breathing motion to a phantom with 20 implanted MOSFET detectors; MOSFET dose (cGy), delivery time, and MU/cGy values were recorded. Maximum and mean dose deviations were calculated from MOSFET data. The number of MOSFETs with at least 19 of 20 detectors agreeing with their expected dose within 5% per fraction was calculated across 106 iterations to model dose deviation as function of fraction number for all plan variants. To put interplay plans into clinical context, additional IMRT and VMAT plans were created and delivered for the sites of head and neck, prostate, whole brain, breast, pelvis, and lung. Average modulation and interplay effect were compared to those from conventional linear accelerators, as reported from previous studies.  Results:   The mean beam modulation for plans created for the Halcyon 1.0 linear accelerator was 2.9 MU/cGy (two- to four-field IMRT breast plans), 6.2 MU/cGy (at least five-field IMRT), and 3.6 MU/cGy (four-arc VMAT). To achieve treatment plan objectives, Halcyon 1.0 VMAT plans require more arcs and modulation than VMAT on conventional linear accelerators. Maximum and mean dose deviations increased with increasing plan complexity under tumor motion for breast and lung treatments. Concerning VMAT plans under motion, maximum, and mean dose deviations were higher for one arc than for two arcs regardless of plan complexity. For plan variants with maximum dose deviations greater than 3.7%, dose deviation as a function of fraction number was protracted.  Conclusion:   For treatments on the Halcyon 1.0 linear accelerator, the convergence of dose deviation with fraction number happened more slowly than reported for conventional linear accelerators. However, if plan complexity is reduced for IMRT and if tumor motion is less than ~10-mm, interplay is greatly reduced. To minimize dose deviations across multiple fractions for dynamic targets, we recommend limiting treatment plan complexity and avoiding one-arc VMAT on the Halcyon 1.0 linear accelerator when interplay is a concern.""","""['Tucker Netherton', 'Yuting Li', 'Paige Nitsch', 'Simona Shaitelman', 'Peter Balter', 'Song Gao', 'Ann Klopp', 'Manickam Muruganandham', 'Laurence Court']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Use of a realistic breathing lung phantom to evaluate dose delivery errors.', 'Investigation of pulsed IMRT and VMAT for re-irradiation treatments: dosimetric and delivery feasibilities.', 'Comparison of MLC positioning deviations using log files and establishment of specific assessment parameters for different accelerators with IMRT and VMAT.', 'Utilising the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training System to Support Undergraduate Teaching of IMRT, VMAT, DCAT Treatment Planning, and QA Concepts.', 'Direct aperture optimization as a means of reducing the complexity of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy plans.', 'Impact of Dosimetric Parameters on Interplay Effects in 6 MV Flattening Filter-Free Photon Beams to Treat Lung Cancer.', 'Dosimetric Evaluation of the QFix kVueTM Calypso Couch Top.', 'Comprehensive validation of halcyon 2.0 plans and the implementation of patient specific QA with multiple detector platforms.', 'Initial Clinical Experience Treating Patients with Breast Cancer on a 6-MV Flattening-Filter-Free O-Ring Linear Accelerator.', 'Variation in accumulated dose of volumetric-modulated arc therapy for pancreatic cancer due to different beam starting phases.']"""

Once one grade 2 toxicity or dose-limiting toxicity was observed in Cycle 1, the accelerated dose titration was terminated and a 3 + 3 dose escalation was started. Continuous daily dosing was evaluated along with two intermittent regimens (7 days on/7 days off and 3 times per week).

We identify and validate a new class of E26 transformation-specific (ETS)-fusion-negative tumors defined by mutations in epigenetic regulators, as well as alterations in pathways not previously implicated in prostate cancer, such as the spliceosome pathway. We find that the incidence of significantly mutated genes (SMGs) follows a long-tail distribution, with many genes mutated in less than 3% of cases. We identify a total of 97 SMGs, including 70 not previously implicated in prostate cancer, such as the ubiquitin ligase CUL3 and the transcription factor SPEN.

Here we describe a method for cell analysis-single-cell mRNA cytometry-that enables the isolation of rare cells from whole blood as a function of target mRNA sequences. This approach uses two classes of magnetic particles that are labelled to selectively hybridize with different regions of the target mRNA. Hybridization leads to the formation of large magnetic clusters that remain localized within the cells of interest, thereby enabling the cells to be magnetically separated. Targeting specific intracellular mRNAs enablescirculating tumour cells to be distinguished from normal haematopoietic cells. No polymerase chain reaction amplification is required to determine RNA expression levels and genotype at the single-cell level, and minimal cell manipulation is required.

The oncoprotein binds ERBB3-ERBB2 heterodimers and activates downstream signaling, supporting a therapeutic paradigm of ERBB3/ERBB2 inhibition. As proof of concept, a durable response was achieved with anti-ERBB3 mAb therapy (GSK2849330) in an exceptional responder with an NRG1-rearranged IMA on a phase I trial (NCT01966445). In contrast, response was not achieved with anti-ERBB2 therapy (afatinib) in four patients with NRG1-rearranged IMA (including the index patient post-GSK2849330). Although in vitro data supported the use of either ERBB3 or ERBB2 inhibition, these clinical results were consistent with more profound antitumor activity and downstream signaling inhibition with anti-ERBB3 versus anti-ERBB2 therapy in an NRG1-rearranged patient-derived xenograft model. Analysis of 8,984 and 17,485 tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas and MSK-IMPACT datasets, respectively, identified NRG1 rearrangements with novel fusion partners in multiple histologies, including breast, head and neck, renal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and uterine cancers.Significance: This series highlights the utility of ERBB3 inhibition as a novel treatment paradigm for NRG1-rearranged cancers. In addition, it provides preliminary evidence that ERBB3 inhibition may be more optimal than ERBB2 inhibition.

To address these challenges, a novel robust projective dictionary learning (RPDL) scheme is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the RPDL method integrates the dimension reduction and dictionary learning into a unified framework for shape prior modeling, which can not only learn a robust and representative dictionary with the energy preservation of the training data, but also reduce the dimensionality and computational cost via the subspace learning. In addition, the proposed RPDL algorithm is regularized by using the norm to handle the outliers and noises, and is embedded in an online framework so that of memory and time efficiency. The proposed method is employed to model prostate shape prior for the application of magnetic resonance transrectal ultrasound registration. The experimental results demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and robust shape modeling than the state-of-the-art methods do.

However, Gleason 8-10 PCa and more aggressive metastatic PCa have been shown to exhibit a higher glycolytic activity.  Objective:   To evaluate the potential of intraprostatic FDG uptake to prognose Gleason 8-10 PCa patients prior to prostatectomy, based on tumour intrinsic biology.  Design, setting, and participants:   FDG-PET/CT and a bone scan were performed as a staging procedure prior to prostatectomy in 148 consecutive patients diagnosed with PCa with a Gleason sum of ≥8 at biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The FDG-PET/CT images were blind reviewed. Lymph node (LN) metastasis and intraprostatic FDG uptake were systematically recorded, and correlated with the patients' clinicopathological characteristics.  Results and limitations:   FDG-PET/CT detected foci of intraprostatic FDG uptake in 66% of patients. An intraprostatic FDG uptake of maximum intraprostatic standardised uptake value (SUVmax) of ≥4.6 was statistically significantly associated with a higher pathological Gleason ≥8, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and pathological LN metastasis. In multivariate analysis, an intraprostatic SUVmax of ≥4.6 was associated with a two-fold increased risk of biochemical recurrence in the year following surgery. Patients with an intraprostatic SUVmax of ≥4.6 had estimated median biochemical recurrence-free survival (BFS) of 11.3mo compared with 49.5mo for those with a lower SUVmax. Finally, high intraprostatic FDG uptake was associated with shorter time to castration resistance following radical prostatectomy (RP).  Conclusions:   Preoperative intraprostatic FDG uptake is an integrator of adverse pathological prognostic factors, predicting BFS and castration resistance following RP in patients with a Gleason score ≥8 PCa at biopsy. These results support the use of preoperative FDG-PET/CT as a tool to distinguish at diagnosis very high-risk Gleason 8-10 PCa patients in whom novel neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies should be explored.

Methods:   DIR (SmartAdapt®v13.6) was validated using two methods namely contour propagation accuracy and landmark tracking, using physical phantoms and clinical images of various disease sites. Five in-house made phantoms with various known deformations and a set of 10 virtual phantoms were used. Displacement in lateral, anterio-posterior (AP) and superior-inferior (SI) direction were evaluated for various organs and compared with the ground truth. Four clinical sites namely, brain (n = 5), HN (n = 9), cervix (n = 18) and prostate (n = 23) were used. Organs were manually delineated by a radiation oncologist, compared with the deformable image registration (DIR) generated contours. 3D slicer v4.5.0.1 was used to analyze Dice Similarity Co-efficient (DSC), shift in centre of mass (COM) and Hausdorff distances Hf95%/avg.  Results:   Mean (SD) DSC, Hf95% (mm), Hfavg (mm) and COM of all the phantoms 1-5 were 0.84 (0.2) mm, 5.1 (7.4) mm, 1.6 (2.2) mm, and 1.6 (0.2) mm respectively. Phantom-5 had the largest deformation as compared to phantoms 1-4, and hence had suboptimal indices. The virtual phantom resulted in consistent results for all the ROIs investigated. Contours propagated for brain patients were better with a high DSC score (0.91 (0.04)) as compared to other sites (HN: 0.84, prostate: 0.81 and cervix 0.77). A similar trend was seen in other indices too. The accuracy of propagated contours is limited for complex deformations that include large volume and shape change of bladder and rectum respectively.

Results:   In the present study, we found that SGK1 expression positively correlates with human prostate cancer (PCa) progression and metastasis. We show that SGK1 inhibition significantly attenuates EMT and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo, whereas overexpression of SGK1 dramaticlly promoted the invasion and migration of PCa cells. Our further results suggest that SGK1 inhibition induced antimetastatic effects, at least partially via autophagy-mediated repression of EMT through the downregulation of Snail. Moreover, ectopic expression of SGK1 obviously attenuated the GSK650394-induced autophagy and antimetastatic effects. What's more, dual inhibition of mTOR and SGK1 enhances autophagy and leads to synergistic antimetastatic effects on PCa cells.

Criteria to standardize referral have been endorsed, but their application is yet to be tested at the population level.  Objectives:   This study sought to establish the need for standardized referral by examining current end-of-life care outcomes of decedents with cancer and define transition points within a cancer illness course, which are associated with poor prognosis, whereby palliative care should be routinely introduced to augment clinician-based decision making.  Methods:   Population cohort study of admitted patients with advanced cancer diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), prostate or breast cancer between 2000 and 2010 in Victoria, Australia, identified from routinely collected, linked, hospital discharge, emergency department, and death registration data. Descriptive statistics described quality indicators for end-of-life care outcomes for decedents. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to test the predefined transition point that mostly accurately predicted survival of six months or lesser.  Results:   About 46,700 cases (56% females) were admitted with metastatic NSCLC (n = 14,759; 31.6%), SCLC (n = 2932; 6%), prostate (n = 9445; 20.2%), and breast cancer (n = 19,564; 41.9%). Of the 29,680 decedents, most (80%) died in hospital, had suboptimal end-of-life care outcomes (83%), and 59% received a palliative approach to care, a median of 27 days before death. Transition points in the cancer illness course of all cases were identified as first admission with any metastatic disease (NSCLC: 3.8 months [interquartile range {IQR} 1.1, 16.0]; n = 14,666; and SCLC: 4.2 months [IQR 1.0, 10.6]; n = 2914); first multiday admission with any metastatic disease (prostate: 6.0 months [IQR 1.3, 26.4]; n = 7174); and first multiday admission with at least one visceral metastatic site (breast: 6.0 months [IQR 1.2, 29.8]; n = 7120).  Conclusion:   Despite calls for integrated palliative care, this occurs late or not at all for many patients with cancer.

Paclitaxel (PTX) is the first line chemotherapy for PCa treatment, but its therapeutic efficacy is greatly restricted by the nonspecific distribution in vivo. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed on the surface of most PCa cells, and its expression level increases with cancer aggressiveness, while being present at low levels in normal cells. The high expression level of PSMA in PCa cells offers an opportunity for target delivery of nonspecific cytotoxic drugs to PCa cells, thus improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing toxicity. PSMA has high affinity for DUPA, a glutamate urea ligand. Herein, a novel DUPA-PTX conjugate is developed using DUPA as the targeting ligand to deliver PTX specifically for treatment of PSMA expressing PCa. The targeting ligand DUPA enhances the transport capability and selectivity of PTX to tumor cells via PSMA mediated endocytosis. Besides, DUPA is conjugated with PTX via a disulfide bond, which facilitates the rapid and differential drug release in tumor cells. The DUPA-PTX conjugate exhibits potent cytotoxicity in PSMA expressing cell lines and induces a complete cessation of tumor growth with no obvious toxicity. Our findings give new insight into the PSMA-targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics and provide an opportunity for the development of novel active targeting drug delivery systems for PCa therapy.""","""['Qingzhi Lv', 'Jincheng Yang', 'Ruoshi Zhang', 'Zimeng Yang', 'Zhengtao Yang', 'Yongjun Wang', 'Youjun Xu', 'Zhonggui He']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Synthesis and biological evaluation of copper-64 radiolabeled DUPA-6-Ahx-(NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2, a novel bivalent targeting vector having affinity for two distinct biomarkers (GRPr/PSMA) of prostate cancer.', 'Paclitaxel-loaded and A10-3.2 aptamer-targeted poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) nanobubbles for ultrasound imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Tumor Uptake of Triazine Dendrimers Decorated with Four, Sixteen, and Sixty-Four PSMA-Targeted Ligands: Passive versus Active Tumor Targeting.', 'Targeting Nanomedicines to Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Specificity of Ligands to Two Different Receptors In Vivo.', 'Current application and future perspectives of prostate specific membrane antigen PET imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Chemically programmable bacterial probes for the recognition of cell surface proteins.', 'Old Drug, New Delivery Strategy: MMAE Repackaged.', 'Targeting Carbohydrate Mimetics of Tetrahydrofuran-Containing Acetogenins to Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of the reducing potential of PSMA-containing endosomes by FRET imaging.', 'Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of biotinylated colchicine derivatives as potential antitumor agents.']"""

It encodes a lipid phosphatase that serves as a gatekeeper of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway. Germline mutation frequently occurs in this gene in patients diagnosed with PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS). PHTS individuals are characterized by macrocephaly, benign growth of multiple tissues and increased tumor risk. In addition, autistic phenotypes are found in 10-20% of individuals carrying the germline PTEN mutation with macrocephaly. In this report, 13 suspected PHTS patients were screened for mutation in the PTEN gene. A missense variant (c. 302T > C) substituting the isoleucine at codon 101 to a threonine, a single nucleotide insertion (c. 327-328insC) causing a frame shift mutation and termination at codon 109, and a nonsense variant (c. 1003C > T) truncated the protein at codon 335 were identified. The I101T mutation significantly reduced PTEN protein expression levels by 2.5- to 4.0-fold. Mechanistically, I101T reduced the protein half-life of PTEN possibly due to enhanced polyubiquitination at Lysine 13. However, the I101T mutant retained almost 30% of the lipid phosphatase activity of the wild-type protein. Finally, the I101T mutant has reduced phosphorylation at a PTEN auto-dephosphorylation site at Threonine 366 and a lowered ratio of nuclear to cytosolic protein level. These partial losses of multiple PTEN biochemical functions may contribute to the tissue overgrowth and autistic features of this PHTS patient.

LAY SUMMARY: The genetics of autism spectrum disorders is highly complex with individual risk influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Mutation in the human PTEN gene confers a high risk of developing autistic behavior. This report revealed that PTEN mutations occurred in 23% of a selected group of Hong Kong patients harboring autistic features with gross overgrowth symptoms.

Methods Standard therapy for newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer has been ADT alone. Three studies have compared ADT alone with ADT and docetaxel, and two studies have compared ADT alone with ADT and abiraterone. Results Three prospective randomized studies (GETUG-AFU 15, STAMPEDE, and CHAARTED) examined overall survival (OS) with adding docetaxel to ADT. STAMPEDE and CHAARTED favored docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; n = 2,962 and HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.89; n = 790, respectively). GETUG-AFU 15 was negative. LATITUDE and STAMPEDE examined the impact on OS of adding abiraterone (with prednisone or prednisolone) to ADT. LATITUDE and STAMPEDE favored abiraterone (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.76; n = 1,199 and HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.76; n = 1,917, respectively). Recommendations ADT plus docetaxel or abiraterone in newly diagnosed metastatic non-castrate prostate cancer offers a survival benefit as compared with ADT alone. The strongest evidence of benefit with docetaxel is in men with de novo high-volume (CHAARTED criteria) metastatic disease. Similar survival benefits are seen using abiraterone acetate in high-risk patients (LATITUDE criteria) and in the metastatic population in STAMPEDE. ADT plus abiraterone and ADT plus docetaxel have not been compared, and it is not known if some men benefit more from one regimen as opposed to the other. Fitness for chemotherapy, patient comorbidities, toxicity profiles, quality of life, drug availability, and cost should be considered in this decision.

Analyses of RNA sequencing of microRNA (miRNA) expression revealed that miR-99a-3p (passenger strand) is significantly downregulated in several types of cancers. Here, we aimed to identify novel miR-99a-3p regulatory networks and therapeutic targets for CRPC. Ectopic expression of miR-99a-3p significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in PCa cells. Non-SMC condensin I complex subunit G (NCAPG) was a direct target of miR-99a-3p in PCa cells. Overexpression of NCAPG was detected in CRPC clinical specimens and was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival and advanced clinical stage. Knockdown of NCAPG inhibited cancer cell aggressiveness. The passenger strand miR-99a-3p acted as an antitumor miRNA in naïve PCa and CRPC. NCAPG was regulated by miR-99a-3p, and its overexpression was involved in CRPC pathogenesis.

Recent clinical trials have shown that men experiencing BCR might benefit from earlier intervention post-radical prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify earlier prognostic biomarkers which will guide clinicians in making accurate diagnosis and timely decisions on the next appropriate treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate Serum Response Factor (SRF) protein expression following RP and to investigate its association with BCR.  Materials and methods:   SRF nuclear expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in TMAs across three international radical prostatectomy cohorts for a total of 615 patients. Log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used for BCR comparisons. Stepwise backwards elimination proportional hazard regression analysis was used to explore the significance of SRF in predicting BCR in the context of other clinical pathological variables. Area under the curve (AUC) values were generated by simulating repeated random sub-samples.  Results:   Analysis of the immunohistochemical staining of benign versus cancer cores showed higher expression of nuclear SRF protein expression in cancer cores compared with benign for all the three TMAs analysed (P < 0.001, n = 615). Kaplan-Meier curves of the three TMAs combined showed that patients with higher SRF nuclear expression had a shorter time to BCR compared with patients with lower SRF expression (P < 0.001, n = 215). Together with pathological T stage T3, SRF was identified as a predictor of BCR using stepwise backwards elimination proportional hazard regression analysis (P = 0.0521). Moreover ROC curves and AUC values showed that SRF was better than T stage in predicting BCR at year 3 and 5 following radical prostatectomy, the combination of SRF and T stage had a higher AUC value than the two taken separately.  Conclusions:   SRF assessment by IHC following RP could be useful in guiding clinicians to better identify patients for appropriate follow-up and timely treatment.""","""['Maria Prencipe', 'Aurelie Fabre', 'Thomas Brendan Murphy', 'Eszter Vargyas', ""Amanda O'Neill"", 'Anders Bjartell', 'Kristin Austlid Tasken', 'Helene H Grytli', 'Aud Svindland', 'Viktor Berge', 'Lars M Eri', 'William Gallagher', 'R William Watson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Preoperative predictive factors and further risk stratification of biochemical recurrence in clinically localized high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Aetiology and management of earlier vs later biochemical recurrence after retropubic radical prostatectomy.', 'Akt Activation Correlates with Snail Expression and Potentially Determines the Recurrence of Prostate Cancer in Patients at Stage T2 after a Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Positive STAT5 Protein and Locus Amplification Status Predicts Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy to Assist Clinical Precision Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: Current status of its use as a treatment endpoint and early management strategies.', 'Gene networks and transcriptional regulators associated with liver cancer development and progression.', 'Inhibition of Serum Response Factor Improves Response to Enzalutamide in Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-dependent phosphorylation and phospho-proteome targets in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Significance and Potential Regulatory Mechanisms of Serum Response Factor in 1118 Cases of Thyroid Cancer Based on Gene Chip and RNA-Sequencing Data.']"""

Methods:   Medical records and daily treatment logs for 71 patients who received CK tumor-tracking SBRT were retrospectively analyzed. Statistical relationships between prostate motion and various outcome results, including local recurrence (LR), biochemical failure (BF), and treatment-related toxicity, were investigated in order to evaluate motion-dependent efficacy of tumor-tracking SBRT for Pca.  Results:   In a total 71 patients, 3 (4.2%) patients with LR, 12 (16.9%) patients with BF, and 22 (31%) patients with grade-II or worse toxicities to rectal or bladder (22 to rectal, 22 to bladder and 8 patients to both) were observed in a median follow-up of 47 months. Magnitudes of intra-fractional tumor motion along superior-inferior, right-left, and anterior-posterior (AP) axes were 0.15 ± 0.31, 0.12 ± 0.19, and 0.73 ± 0.32 mm, respectively. Radial magnitude was estimated to be 1.0 ± 0.35 mm. Intra-fractional movement was not significantly correlated with tumor control. However, it was significant correlated with the incidence of grade-II or worse toxicity to rectum or bladder particularly when tumor motion was in the AP axis.  Conclusion:   Our quantitative results revealed that toxicity related to SBRT treatment was highly sensitive to intra-fractional prostate movements, although local-tumor control was not affected by such movements.

Patients and methods:   Analysis of clinical outcomes from a prospective cohort of patients treated with LDR-PB alone or combined treatment in a single institution. Men with a high risk of disease relapse were identified by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) criteria or by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria. Relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and metastases-free survival (MFS), were analysed together with patient-reported symptom scores and physician-reported adverse events.  Results:   The NICE and NCCN criteria identified 267 and 202 high-risk patients, respectively. NICE-defined patients had significantly lower pre-treatment PSA levels, Gleason scores <7, and a greater proportion of patients who received LDR-PB monotherapy. At 9 years after implantation RFS was 89% and 87% in the NICE and NCCN groups, respectively (log-rank P = 0.637), and OS 93% and 94%, respectively (log-rank P = 0.481). All of the survival estimates were similar between LDR-PB monotherapy and combined therapies. Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed RFS was similar between the treatment types. Treatment-related toxicity was also similar between the treatment methods.  Conclusion:   LDR-PB is effective at controlling localised prostate cancer in patients with a high risk of disease relapse. As the present study was not randomised, it is not possible to define those patients who need the addition of ADT and/or EBRT. However, the NICE criteria appear suitable to define treatment options where patients could benefit from LDR-PB as monotherapy or combined treatment.

New and innovative NO- and H2S-releasing doxorubicins (NitDox and H2SDox) showed a good intracellular accumulation and high cytotoxic activity in vitro in an androgen-independent and doxorubicin-resistant DU-145 prostate cancer cell line.

Animal weight, tumor volume, intra-tumoral drug accumulation, apoptosis and the presence of nitrotyrosine and sulfhydryl (SH) groups within the tumor, were evaluated. Cardiotoxicity was assessed by measuring troponin plasma levels and the left ventricular wall thickness.

We have recently shown that diindolylmethane (DIM) and several of its halogenated derivatives (ring-DIMs) induce death and protective autophagy in human prostate cancer cells. However, the in vivo efficacy of ring-DIMs and the use of autophagy inhibitors as adjuvant therapy have not yet been studied in vivo. The objective of this study was to determine these effects on tumor growth in nude CD-1 mice bearing bioluminescent androgen-independent PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. We found that chloroquine (CQ) significantly sensitized PC-3 cells to death in the presence of sub-toxic concentrations of DIM or 4,4'-Br2DIM in vitro. Moreover, a combination of DIM (10 mg/kg) and CQ (60 mg/kg), 3× per week, significantly decreased PC-3 tumor growth in vivo after 3 and 4 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, 4,4'-Br2DIM at 10 mg/kg (3× per week) significantly inhibited tumour growth after 4 weeks of treatment. Tissues microarray analysis showed that DIM alone or combined with CQ induced apoptosis marker TUNEL; the combination also significantly inhibited the cell proliferation marker Ki67. In conclusion, we have confirmed that DIM and 4,4'-Br2DIM are effective agents against prostate cancer in vivo and shown that inhibition of autophagy with CQ enhances the anticancer efficacy of DIM. Our results suggest that including selective autophagy inhibitors as adjuvants may improve the efficacy of existing and novel drug therapies against prostate cancer.""","""['Hossam Draz', 'Alexander A Goldberg', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Stephen Safe', 'J Thomas Sanderson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['Diindolylmethane and its halogenated derivatives induce protective autophagy in human prostate cancer cells via induction of the oncogenic protein AEG-1 and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).', ""Ring-substituted analogs of 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) induce apoptosis and necrosis in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells."", ""Antiandrogenic and growth inhibitory effects of ring-substituted analogs of 3,3'-diindolylmethane (ring-DIMs) in hormone-responsive LNCaP human prostate cancer cells."", 'Indole-3-carbinol and prostate cancer.', ""Attenuation of multi-targeted proliferation-linked signaling by 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM): from bench to clinic."", 'Research Trend and Detailed Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms of Food Bioactive Compounds against Cancer: A Comprehensive Review with Special Emphasis on Probiotics.', 'Chloroquine-Induced DNA Damage Synergizes with Nonhomologous End Joining Inhibition to Cause Ovarian Cancer Cell Cytotoxicity.', 'Silencing of FTX suppresses pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and invasion by upregulating miR-513b-5p.', 'Chloroquine reverses chemoresistance via upregulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 and autophagy inhibition in ovarian cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Energetics and Biosynthesis.']"""

Material and methods:   We included 6195 patients with cT1-3N0M0 prostate cancer treated using radical laparoscopic prostatectomy (RLP) and radical robot-assisted prostatectomy at our institution between 2000 and 2016. None of the patients underwent adjuvant therapy. BR is defined as PSA levels ≥0.2 ng/dL. The time to BR is divided into terciles to identify the variables associated with early (<12 months), intermediate (12-36 months) and late (>36 months) recurrence. We employed logistic regression models to determine the risk factors associated with each interval.  Results:   We identified 1148 (18.3%) patients with BR. The median time to BR was 24 months (IQR, 0.98-53.18). The multivariate analysis showed that preoperative PSA levels, lymph node invasion, positive margins and RLP are associated with early recurrence (P≤.029 for all).

Novel androgen receptor pathway inhibitors are nowadays available for treatment of metastatic PCa and these compounds are promising for early stage disease. Apalutamide is a pure androgen antagonist with a very high affinity with the androgen receptor. The combination of apalutamide with degarelix, an LHRH antagonist, could increase the efficacy compared to degarelix alone.  Objective:   The primary objective is to assess the difference in proportions of minimal residual disease at prostatectomy specimen between apalutamide + degarelix vs placebo + degarelix. Various secondary endpoints are assessed: variations of different biomarkers at the tumour level (tissue microarrays to evaluate DNA-PKs, PARP, AR and splice variants, PSMA, etc.), whole transcriptome sequencing, exome sequencing and clinical (PSA and testosterone kinetics, early biochemical recurrence free survival, quality of life, safety, etc.) and radiological endpoints.  Methods:   ARNEO is a single centre, phase II, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. The plan is to include at least 42 patients per each of the two study arms. Patients with intermediate/high-risk PCa and who are amenable for radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection can be included. After signing an informed consent, every patient will undergo a pelvic 68Ga -PSMA-11 PSMA PET/MR and receive degarelix at standard dosage and start assuming apalutamide/placebo (60 mg 4 tablets/day) for 12 weeks. Within thirty days from the last study medication intake the same imaging will be repeated. Every patient will undergo PSA and testosterone testing the day of randomization, before the first drug intake, and after the last dose. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumour samples will be collected and used for transcriptome analysis, exome sequencing and immunohistochemistry.  Discussion:   ARNEO will allow us to answer, first, whether the combined treatment can result in an increased proportion of patients with minimal residual disease. Secondly, It will enable the study of the molecular consequences at the level of the tumour. Thirdly, what the consequences are of new generation androgen receptor pathway inhibitors on 68Ga -PSMA-11 PET/MR. Finally, various clinical, safety and quality of life data will be collected.

The aim of this study was firstly to examine the effect of hypoxia on the alternative splicing of cancer associated genes using the prostate cancer cell line PC3 as a model. Secondly, the effect of hypoxia on the expression of several regulators of splicing was examined.  Methods:   PC3 cells were grown in 1% oxygen in a hypoxic chamber for 48 h, RNA extracted and sent for high throughput PCR analysis at the RNomics platform at the University of Sherbrooke, Canada. Genes whose exon inclusion rate PSI (ψ) changed significantly were identified, and their altered exon inclusion rates verified by RT-PCR in three cell lines. The expression of splice factors and splice factor kinases in response to hypoxia was examined by qPCR and western blotting. The splice factor kinase CLK1 was inhibited with the benzothiazole TG003.  Results:   In PC3 cells the exon inclusion rate PSI (ψ) was seen to change by > 25% in 12 cancer-associated genes; MBP, APAF1, PUF60, SYNE2, CDC42BPA, FGFR10P, BTN2A2, UTRN, RAP1GDS1, PTPN13, TTC23 and CASP9 (caspase 9). The expression of the splice factors SRSF1, SRSF2, SRSF3, SAM68, HuR, hnRNPA1, and of the splice factor kinases SRPK1 and CLK1 increased significantly in hypoxia. We also observed that the splice factor kinase CLK3, but not CLK2 and CLK4, was also induced in hypoxic DU145 prostate, HT29 colon and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. Lastly, we show that the inhibition of CLK1 in PC3 cells with the benzothiazole TG003 increased expression of the anti-apoptotic isoform caspase 9b.  Conclusions:   Significant changes in alternative splicing of cancer associated genes occur in prostate cancer cells in hypoxic conditions. The expression of several splice factors and splice factor kinases increases during hypoxia, in particular the Cdc-like splice factor kinases CLK1 and CLK3. We suggest that in hypoxia the elevated expression of these regulators of splicing helps cells adapt through alternative splicing of key cancer-associated genes. We suggest that the CLK splice factor kinases could be targeted in cancers in which hypoxia contributes to resistance to therapy.""","""['Elizabeth Bowler', 'Sean Porazinski', 'Simon Uzor', 'Philippe Thibault', 'Mathieu Durand', 'Elvy Lapointe', 'Kasper M A Rouschop', 'John Hancock', 'Ian Wilson', 'Michael Ladomery']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Autoregulation of the human splice factor kinase CLK1 through exon skipping and intron retention.', 'CDC2-like (CLK) protein kinase inhibition as a novel targeted therapeutic strategy in prostate cancer.', 'Increased Serine-Arginine (SR) Protein Phosphorylation Changes Pre-mRNA Splicing in Hypoxia.', 'RNA splicing and splicing regulator changes in prostate cancer pathology.', ""Human CDC2-like kinase 1 (CLK1): a novel target for Alzheimer's disease."", 'Cdc2-like kinases: structure, biological function, and therapeutic targets for diseases.', 'Poison cassette exon splicing of SRSF6 regulates nuclear speckle dispersal and the response to hypoxia.', 'Short-Term Hypoxia in Cells Induces Expression of Genes Which Are Enhanced in Stressed Cells.', 'Effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on asthma patients.', 'Cyclic Hypoxia Induces Transcriptomic Changes in Mast Cells Leading to a Hyperresponsive Phenotype after FcεRI Cross-Linking.']"""

Recent studies indicated that cell division cycle 20 homolog (Cdc20) overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, the mechanism of Cdc20 in the development of docetaxel resistance in CRPC remains elusive.  Methods:   In this study, the transcription of Cdc20 was confirmed in three independent CRPC cell lines derived from different tissues, including LNCaP, PC3, and DU145. Docetaxel resistant (DR) cell lines were generated within the background of DU145 and PC3. The protein levels of Cdc20 and the biological phenotype were detected in both wild-type and DR cell lines. To further explore the mechanism of Cdc20 overexpression, stable cell lines with Cdc20 or Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) deprivation were generated and examined for biological parameters. In addition, a specific Cdc20 inhibitor was used in DR cell lines to explore the potential solution for docetaxel resistant CRPC.  Results:   Here, we identified Cdc20 is overexpressed in docetaxel resistant CRPC cell lines, including LNCaP, PC3, and DU145. We also reported that DR cell lines, which mimic the recurrent prostate cancer cells after docetaxel treatment, have higher levels of Cdc20 protein compared with the CRPC cell lines. Interestingly, the protein levels of Bim, an E3 ligase substrate of Cdc20, were decreased in DR cell lines compared with the wild-type, while the mRNA levels were similar. More importantly, in DR cell lines, the biological phenotype induced by Cdc20 deletion could be significantly reversed by the additional knockdown of Bim. As a result, docetaxel resistant prostate cancer cells treated with the pharmacological Cdc20 inhibitor became sensitive to docetaxel treatment.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, our data collectively demonstrated that Cdc20 overexpression facilitates the docetaxel resistant of the CRPC cell lines in a Bim-dependent manner. Furthermore, additionally targeting Cdc20 might be a promising solution for the treatment of the CRPC with docetaxel resistance.""","""['Fei Wu', 'Yun Lin', 'Peng Cui', 'Hongyun Li', 'Lechao Zhang', 'Zeqiang Sun', 'Shengliang Huang', 'Shun Li', 'Shiming Huang', 'Qingli Zhao', 'Qingyong Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Effect of FAK inhibitor VS-6063 (defactinib) on docetaxel efficacy in prostate cancer.', 'FOXM1 contributes to docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer by inducing AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy.', 'Silencing of CDC20 suppresses metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer growth and enhances chemosensitivity to docetaxel.', 'Emerging targets to monitor and overcome docetaxel resistance in castration resistant prostate cancer (review).', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'CDC20 Is Regulated by the Histone Methyltransferase, KMT5A, in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'CDC20: a novel therapeutic target in cancer.', 'A novel ferroptosis-related gene prognostic index for prognosis and response to immunotherapy in patients with prostate cancer.', 'CDC20 is a novel biomarker for improved clinical predictions in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'The Prognostic Assessment of CDC20 in Patients with Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma and Its Relationship with Body Immunity.']"""

We estimated the extent to which reducing high BMI could lower cancer incidence in Brazil, nationally as well as at regional and state levels.  Methods:   We calculated fractions of cancer incidence in 2012 attributable to high BMI as well as projections for attributable cases in 2025 using BMI data from representative national surveys and relative risks published in meta-analyses. Estimates of cancer incidence were retrieved from GLOBOCAN and the Brazilian National Cancer Institute.  Results:   We found that 15,465 (3.8%) of all new cancer cases diagnosed in Brazil in 2012 were attributable to high BMI, with a higher burden in women (5.2%) than in men (2.6%). The cancer sites contributing most to the number of attributable cases were breast (n = 4777), corpus uteri (n = 1729), and colon (n = 681) in women, and colon (n = 1062), prostate (n = 926), and liver (n = 651) in men.

Method:   Experiments were conducted on five tissue mimicking phantoms in a controlled environment. The seeds were implanted into each phantom using an EM-tracked needle, which allowed recording of seed drop locations. After each needle, we reconstructed a 3D ultrasound (US) volume by compounding a series of 2D US images acquired during retraction of an EM-tracked TRUS probe. Then, a difference image was generated by nonrigid registration and subtraction of two consecutive US volumes. A US-only seed detection method was used to detect seed candidates in the difference volume, based on the signature of the seeds. Finally, the EM-based positions of the seeds were used to detect the false positives of the US-based seed detection method and also to estimate the positions of the missing seeds. After the conclusion of the seed implant process, we acquired a CT image. The ground truth for seed locations was obtained by localizing the seeds in the CT image and registering them to the US coordinate system.  Results:   Compared to the ground truth, the US-only detection algorithm achieved a localization error mean of 1.7 mm with a detection rate of 85%. By contrast, the EM-only seed localization method achieved a localization error mean of 3.7 mm with a detection rate of 100%. By fusing EM-tracking information with US imaging, we achieved a localization error mean of 1.8 mm while maintaining a 100% detection rate without any false positives.  Conclusions:   Fusion of EM-tracking and US imaging for prostate brachytherapy can combine high localization accuracy of US-based seed detection with the robustness and high detection rate of EM-based seed localization. Our phantom experiments serve as a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential value of integrating EM-tracking into LDR prostate brachytherapy.""","""['Ehsan Dehghan', 'Shyam Bharat', 'Cynthia Kung', 'Antonio Bonillas', 'Luc Beaulieu', 'Jean Pouliot', 'Jochen Kruecker']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Electromagnetic tracking for catheter reconstruction in ultrasound-guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy of the prostate.', 'BrachyView: Combining LDR seed positions with transrectal ultrasound imaging in a prostate gel phantom.', 'Computing intraoperative dosimetry for prostate brachytherapy using TRUS and fluoroscopy.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

Inclusion of additional features for categorization may provide benefit to stratification of disease.  Purpose:   To prospectively compare PI-RADSv2 to a qualitative in-house system for detecting prostate cancer on mpMRI.  Study type:   Prospective.  Population:   In all, 338 patients who underwent mpMRI May 2015-May 2016, with subsequent MRI/transrectal ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy.  Field strength:   3T mpMRI (T2 W, diffusion-weighted [DW], apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] map, b-2000 DWI acquisition, and dynamic contrast-enhanced [DCE] MRI).  Assessment:   One genitourinary radiologist prospectively read mpMRIs using both in-house and PI-RADSv2 5-category systems.  Statistical test:   In lesion-based analysis, overall and clinically significant (CS) tumor detection rates (TDR) were calculated for all PI-RADSv2 and in-house categories. The ability of each scoring system to detect cancer was assessed by area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Within each PI-RADSv2 category, lesions were further stratified by their in-house categories to determine if TDRs can be increased by combining features of both systems.  Results:   In 338 patients (median prostate-specific antigen [PSA] 6.5 [0.6-113.6] ng/mL; age 64 [44-84] years), 733 lesions were identified (47% tumor-positive). Predictive abilities of both systems were comparable for all (AUC 76-78%) and CS cancers (AUCs 79%). The in-house system had higher overall and CS TDRs than PI-RADSv2 for categories 3 and 4 (P < 0.01 for both), with the greatest difference between the scoring systems seen in lesions scored category 4 (CS TDRs: in-house 65%, PI-RADSv2 22.1%). For lesions categorized as PI-RADSv2 = 4, characterization of suspicious/indeterminate extraprostatic extension (EPE) and equivocal findings across all mpMRI sequences contributed to significantly different TDRs for both systems (TDR range 19-75%, P < 0.05).  Data conclusion:   PI-RADSv2 behaves similarly to an existing validated system that relies on the number of sequences on which a lesion is seen. This prospective evaluation suggests that sequence positivity and suspicion of EPE can enhance PI-RADSv2 category 4 cancer detection.  Level of evidence:   1 Technical Efficacy: Stage 3 J. Magn.

Patients and methods:   This is a retrospective study of data from the South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative (SA-PCCOC). Included were men diagnosed between 2005 and 2014, aged ≥70 years with no evidence of metastatic disease at presentation.

Thus, comparative findings on the patients' HRQOL are becoming even more important to allow for informed treatment decision-making.  Patients and methods:   The Hormonal therapy, Active Surveillance, Radiation, Operation, Watchful Waiting (HAROW) study is a prospective, observational study designed to collect data for different treatment options for newly diagnosed patients with localised prostate cancer under real-life conditions. At 6-month intervals, clinical data (D'Amico risk categories, Charlson Comorbidity Index) and HRQOL (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire 30-item core questionnaire) were collected. Data were analysed by longitudinal multilevel analysis for patients with localised prostate cancer under AS and RP.  Results:   Data from 961 patients (556 RP, 405 AS) were considered. The follow-up was 3.5 years (median 2 years). The results reveal significant, but not clinically relevant advantages for patients with low-risk prostate cancer managed with AS in contrast to RP concerning global HRQOL as well as role, emotional and social functioning over time, after controlling for age, comorbidities, and partnership status. In some, but not all HRQOL scales, RP patients start with a slightly lower HRQOL and recover up to the level of AS patients within 1-2 years after diagnosis.  Conclusion:   HRQOL is an important aspect in the decision-making and advising process for patients with prostate cancer. In many aspects of HRQOL, AS is associated with more favourable outcomes than RP within the first 1-2 years after diagnosis in our observational design, although the differences were not clinically significant. The result that HRQOL in AS patients is at least as high as in RP patients should be considered when advising patients about the different treatment options for low-risk localised prostate cancer.""","""['Lena Ansmann', 'Nicola Winter', 'Nicole Ernstmann', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'Lothar Weissbach', 'Jan Herden']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Patient-physician communication and health-related quality of life of patients with localised prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy - a longitudinal multilevel analysis.', 'Prospective quality-of-life outcomes for low-risk prostate cancer: Active surveillance versus radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term health-related quality of life after primary treatment for localized prostate cancer: results from the CaPSURE registry.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for prostate cancer.', ""The Influence of Practice Structure on Urologists' Treatment of Men With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer."", 'Quality of Life of Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Prostatectomy and Affective Temperament.', 'Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Radiation Therapy: Past and Present.', 'Supported progressive resistance exercise training to counter the adverse side effects of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a randomised controlled trial.', 'Use of psycho-oncological services by prostate cancer patients: A multilevel analysis.']"""

Methods:   Our cohort included men enrolled into two academic tissue repositories from 1993 to 2011, who were treated with first-line RP who later experienced local recurrence, regional recurrence, or distant metastasis (together termed clinical recurrence, CR). RP material was reviewed to identify IDC-P and to update grading to current standards. The primary endpoint was the initial location of CR. Secondary endpoints included time to CR and cancer-specific survival. Pearson's chi-square, Welch's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test were performed for univariate analyses. Multinomial logistic regression was used for multivariate analyses. Cancer-specific survival was analyzed with the generalized Wilcoxon test and Cox regression.  Results:   Eighty-five patients with CR were included in the analysis. IDC-P was present in 78.5% of patients from Center 1 and 70.0% from Center 2 (P = 0.547). IDC-P was independently associated with distant metastasis at initial CR (multivariate odds ratio = 6.27, P = 0.015). IDC-P status did not affect time to recurrence; median survival without recurrence was at 53 months for IDC-P(+) and at 50 months for IDC-P(-) (P = 0.441). Distant metastases at the initial CR event had a 36% reduction of cancer-specific survival compared to local recurrences (P = 0.007). Additionally, prostatic-bed radiotherapy (adjuvant or salvage for biochemical recurrence before distant metastasis) was associated with a 25% reduction in cancer-specific mortality compared to no radiotherapy (P = 0.023). Similar reduction in cancer-specific mortality was observed in the subgroup of patients with distant metastasis and IDC-P when treated with radiotherapy (29%, P = 0.050).  Conclusions:   In our cohort, presence of IDC-P was an independent factor for distant metastasis at initial CR, but did not have a significant impact on time to CR. Furthermore, metastatic patients showed statistically reduced cancer-specific mortality when treated with radiotherapy.

In osteolytic lesions, the strain was located below the vertebral body with metastases. In osteosclerotic lesions, the strain was located in the anterior and posterior parts in and below the vertebral body with metastases. Surgery abolished the pathological strain.

Methods: Twenty-eight prostate cancer patients with metastatic disease on conventional imaging prospectively received up to 4 PET/CT scans. All patients completed baseline 18F-DCFBC PET/CT and 18F-NaF PET/CT scans, and 23 patients completed follow-up imaging, with a median follow-up interval of 5.7 mo (range, 4.2-12.6 mo). Lesion detection was compared across the 2 PET/CT agents at each time point. Detection and SUV characteristics of each PET/CT agent were compared with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and treatment status at the time of baseline imaging using nonparametric statistical testing (Spearman correlation, Wilcoxon rank). Results: Twenty-six patients had metastatic disease detected on 18F-NaF or 18F-DCFBC at baseline, and 2 patients were negative on both scans. Three patients demonstrated soft tissue-only disease. Of 241 lesions detected at baseline, 56 were soft-tissue lesions identified by 18F-DCFBC only and 185 bone lesions detected on 18F-NaF or 18F-DCFBC. 18F-NaF detected significantly more bone lesions than 18F-DCFBC (P < 0.001). Correlation of PSA with patient-level SUV metrics was strong in 18F-DCFBC (ρ > 0.5, P < 0.01) and poor in 18F-NaF (ρ < 0.3, P > 0.1). When PSA levels were combined with treatment status, patients with below-median levels of PSA (<2 ng/mL) on androgen deprivation therapy (n = 11) demonstrated more lesions on 18F-NaF than 18F-DCFBC (P = 0.02). In PSA greater than 2 ng/mL, patients on androgen deprivation therapy (n = 8) showed equal to or more lesions on 18F-DCFBC than on 18F-NaF. Conclusion: The utility of PSMA-targeting imaging in metastatic prostate cancer appears to depend on patient disease course and treatment status. Compared with 18F-NaF PET/CT, 18F-DCFBC PET/CT detected significantly fewer bone lesions in the setting of early or metastatic castrate-sensitive disease on treatment.

A molecular imaging agent that enables both presurgery antigen-specific PET (immuno-PET) and intraoperative near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) guidance might benefit diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, staging, and surgical resection, which remains the only curative treatment. Methods: We developed a dual-labeled probe based on A2 cys-diabody (A2cDb) targeting the cell-surface prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), which is expressed in most pancreatic cancers. Maleimide-IRDye800CW was site-specifically conjugated to the C-terminal cys-tag (A2cDb-800) without impairing integrity or affinity (half-maximal binding, 4.3 nM). Direct radioiodination with 124I (124I-A2cDb-800) yielded a specific activity of 159 ± 48 MBq/mg with a radiochemical purity exceeding 99% and 65% ± 4.5% immunoreactivity (n = 3). In vivo specificity for PSCA-expressing tumor cells and biodistribution of the dual-modality tracer were evaluated in a prostate cancer xenograft model and compared with single-labeled 124I-A2cDb. Patient-derived pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma xenografts (PDX-PDACs) were grown subcutaneously in NSG mice and screened for PSCA expression by immuno-PET. Small-animal PET/CT scans of PDX-PDAC-bearing mice were obtained using the dual-modality 124I-A2cDb-800 followed by postmortem NIRF imaging with the skin removed. Tumors and organs were analyzed ex vivo to compare the relative fluorescent signals without obstruction by other organs. Results: Specific uptake in PSCA-positive tumors and low nonspecific background activity resulted in high-contrast immuno-PET images. Concurrent with the PET studies, fluorescent signal was observed in the PSCA-positive tumors of mice injected with the dual-tracer 124I-A2cDb-800, with low background uptake or autofluorescence in the surrounding tissue. Ex vivo biodistribution confirmed comparable tumor uptake of both 124I-A2cDb-800 and 124I-A2cDb. Conclusion: Dual-modality imaging using the anti-PSCA cys-diabody resulted in high-contrast immuno-PET/NIRF images of PDX-PDACs, suggesting that this imaging agent might offer both noninvasive whole-body imaging to localize PSCA-positive pancreatic cancer and fluorescence image-guided identification of tumor margins during surgery.""","""['Kirstin A Zettlitz', 'Wen-Ting K Tsai', 'Scott M Knowles', 'Naoko Kobayashi', 'Timothy R Donahue', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Anna M Wu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['89ZrA2cDb Immuno-PET of Prostate Cancer in a Human Prostate Stem Cell Antigen Knock-in (hPSCA KI) Syngeneic Model.', 'A Dual-Modality Linker Enables Site-Specific Conjugation of Antibody Fragments for 18F-Immuno-PET and Fluorescence Imaging.', 'Dual-Modality ImmunoPET/Fluorescence Imaging of Prostate Cancer with an Anti-PSCA Cys-Minibody.', '64Cu-Labeled NOTA-conjugated anti-CD105 (endoglin) chimeric monoclonal antibody linked to near-infrared dye IRDye 800CW.', '89Zr-Labeled anti-CD105 (endoglin) chimeric monoclonal antibody TRC105 linked to IRDye 800CW.', 'Review and Application of Integrin Alpha v Beta 6 in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cholangiocarcinoma and Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Intraoperative Imaging in Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery.', 'ImmunoPET: Antibody-Based PET Imaging in Solid Tumors.', 'Radiopharmaceuticals for PET and SPECT Imaging: A Literature Review over the Last Decade.', 'On-demand radiosynthesis of N-succinimidyl-4-18Ffluorobenzoate (18FSFB) on an electrowetting-on-dielectric microfluidic chip for 18F-labeling of protein.']"""

However, important characteristics of preclinical PSMA imaging-that is, the reproducibility of the imaging signal and the relationship between quantitative cell surface PSMA expression and lesion detectability with small-animal PET/CT-have not been defined yet. Methods: Murine prostate cancer RM1 sublines (ras myc transformed cells of C57BL/6 prostate origin) expressing varying levels of human PSMA were injected into the shoulder of C57BL/6 mice on day 0. 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/CT was performed on days 7 and 8 and interpreted by 2 masked readers to determine interday and interreader reproducibility. PSMA expression was quantified on days 7 and 8 by flow cytometry of fine-needle aspiration tumor biopsy samples. Cell surface PSMA expression was correlated with PET signal. The threshold for PET positivity was based on the clinical Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging Standardized Evaluation (PROMISE) criteria. Results: The maximum and average percentages of injected 68Ga-PSMA11 activity per gram of tissue (%IA/g) correlated nearly perfectly as determined by 2 independent readers and on 2 separate days (intraclass correlation coefficient, 1.00/0.89 and 0.95/0.88, respectively). The number of PSMA molecules per cell increased from the RM1-yellow fluorescent protein subline (PSMA-; 2,000/cell) to the RM1-low subline (PSMA+; 17,000/cell), the RM1-medium subline (PSMA++; 22,000/cell), and the RM1-PGLS subline (PSMA-positive, green fluorescent protein-positive, and luciferase-positive; PSMA+++; 45,000/cell). Expression levels correlated with the visual positivity rate on 68Ga-PSMA11 PET and with the PSMA PET %IA/g. The PSMA threshold for PET positivity was approximately 20,000 per cell. Signal correlation was close at lower PSMA levels (RM1-low to RM1-medium; 10-23 %IA/g) but was lost at higher PSMA levels (RM1-medium to RM1-PGLS; 23-27 %IA/g). Conclusion: The in vivo relationship between 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/CT and PSMA expression level in a murine model of prostate cancer was robust for lower cell surface PSMA expression levels (≤22,000/cell).

Radiation therapy is one of the reference analgesic treatments. The objective of this study was to compare the current practices of a French radiotherapy department for the treatment of uncomplicated bone metastases with data from the literature in order to improve and optimize the management of patients.  Material and methods:   A retrospective monocentric study of patients who underwent palliative irradiation of uncomplicated bone metastases was performed.  Results:   Ninety-one patients had 116 treatments of uncomplicated bone metastases between January 2014 and December 2015, including 44 men (48%) and 47 women (52%) with an average age of 63years (25-88years). Primary tumours most commonly found were breast cancer (35%), lung cancer (16%) and prostate cancer (12%). The regimens used were in 29% of cases 30Gy in ten fractions (group 30Gy), in 21% of cases 20Gy in five fractions (group 20Gy), in 22% of cases 8Gy in one fraction (group 8Gy) and in 28% of cases 23.31Gy in three fractions of stereotactic body irradiation (stereotactic group). The general condition of the patient (P<0.001), pain score and analgesic (P<0.001), oligometastatic profile (P=0.003) and practitioner experience (P<0.001) were factors influencing the choice of the regimen irradiation. Age (P=0.46), sex (P=0.14), anticancer treatments (P=0.56), concomitant hospitalization (P=0.14) and the distance between the radiotherapy centre and home (P=0.87) did not influence the decision significantly. A total of three cases of spinal compression and one case of post-therapeutic fracture were observed, occurring between one and 128days and 577days after irradiation, respectively. Eight percent of all irradiated metastases were reirradiated with a delay ranging between 13 and 434days after the first irradiation. The re-irradiation rate was significantly higher after 8Gy (P=0.02). The rate of death was significantly lower in the stereotactic arm (P<0.001) and overall survival was significantly greater in the stereotactic arm (P<0.001).  Conclusion:   This study showed that patients' analysed was comparable to the population of different studies. Predictive factors for the choice of the treatment regimen were identified. Non-fractionnated therapy was underutilised while stereotactic treatment was increasingly prescribed, showing an evolution in the management of patients.""","""['C Le Fèvre', 'D Antoni', 'A Thiéry', 'A Keller', 'P Truntzer', 'C Vigneron', 'J-B Clavier', 'S Guihard', 'M Pop', 'C Schumacher', 'P Salze', 'G Noël']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Radiother""","""['Cost of radiotherapy for bone metastases in France: A monocentric retrospective study.', 'Re-irradiation for painful bone metastases using stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Radiotherapy for palliation of symptoms in incurable cancer.', 'Bone metastases radiotherapy: Multi-approaches literature review.', 'Radiotherapy of bone metastases.']"""

We geocoded prostate cancer patient data (n = 10,750) from the Pennsylvania cancer registry from 2005 to 2014 by Philadelphia census tract (CT) to create standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), mortality ratios (SMRs), and mean prostate cancer aggressiveness. We created a prostate cancer composite (PCa composite) variable to describe CTs by mean-centering and standard deviation-scaling the SMR, SIR, and mean aggressiveness variables and summing them. We mapped CTs with the 25 highest PCa composite scores and compared these neighborhoods to CTs with the 25 highest percent African American residents and the 25 lowest median household incomes. The mean PCa composite score among the 25 highest CTs was 4.65. Only seven CTs in Philadelphia had both one of the highest PCa composite scores and the highest percent African American residents. Only five CTs had both the highest PCa composites and the lowest median incomes. Mean PCa composite scores among CTs with the highest percent African American residents and lowest median incomes were 2.08 and 1.19, respectively. The PCa composite score is an accurate metric for prioritizing neighborhoods based on burden. If neighborhoods were prioritized based on percent African American or median income, priority neighborhoods would have been very different and not based on PCa burden. These methods can be utilized by public health decision-makers when tasked to prioritize and select neighborhoods for cancer interventions.""","""['Russell K McIntire', 'Scott W Keith', 'Maxwell Boamah', 'Amy E Leader', 'Karen Glanz', 'Ann C Klassen', 'Charnita M Zeigler-Johnson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prev Med""","""['A novel method for measuring the burden of breast cancer in neighborhoods.', 'Use of empiric methods to inform prostate cancer health disparities: Comparison of neighborhood-wide association study ""hits"" in black and white men.', 'Neighborhood racial composition, social capital and black all-cause mortality in Philadelphia.', 'Racial and Ethnic Trends in Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Philadelphia, PA: an Observational Study.', 'A Systematic Review of Neighborhood Disparities in Point-of-Sale Tobacco Marketing.', 'A novel method for measuring the burden of breast cancer in neighborhoods.', 'The Geographic Context of Racial Disparities in Aggressive Endometrial Cancer Subtypes: Integrating Social and Environmental Aspects to Discern Biological Outcomes.', 'Testing a Prostate Cancer Educational Intervention in High-Burden Neighborhoods.', 'Use of empiric methods to inform prostate cancer health disparities: Comparison of neighborhood-wide association study ""hits"" in black and white men.', 'Putting Evidence Academies into action: Prostate cancer, nutrition, and tobacco control science.']"""

Median OS was projected to be 10 years in the ADT arm, requiring 680 patients per arm to detect a hazard ratio of 1.30 with 92% power and one-sided α = .05. Results Nine hundred sixty-one eligible intent-to-treat patients were randomly assigned to ADT or ADT + MP from October 1999 to January 2007, when the Data Safety Monitoring Committee recommended stopping accrual as a result of higher leukemia incidence with ADT + MP. Median follow-up was 11.2 years. The 10-year OS estimates were 87% with ADT (expected 50%) and 86% with ADT + MP (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.43). The 10-year estimate for disease-free survival was 72% for both arms. Prostate cancer was the cause of death in 18% of patients in the ADT arm and 22% in the ADT + MP arm. More patients in the MP arm died of other cancers (36% v 18% in ADT alone arm). Conclusion MP did not improve OS and increased deaths from other malignancies. The DFS and 10-year OS in these patients treated with 2 years of ADT were encouraging compared with historical estimates, although a definitive conclusion regarding value of ADT may not be made without a nontreatment control arm.""","""['Maha Hussain', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'Ian M Thompson Jr', 'Gregory P Swanson', 'David P Wood', 'Wael Sakr', 'Nancy A Dawson', 'Naomi B Haas', 'Thomas W Flaig', 'Tanya B Dorff', 'Daniel W Lin', 'E David Crawford', 'David I Quinn', 'Nicholas J Vogelzang', 'L Michael Glode']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Errata.', 'Curing More Prostate Cancer: Thinking Through the Options.', 'Adjuvant androgen deprivation for high-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: SWOG S9921 study.', 'Adjuvant radiation therapy, androgen deprivation, and docetaxel for high-risk prostate cancer postprostatectomy: Results of NRG Oncology/RTOG study 0621.', 'Long-term follow-up of a phase II trial of chemotherapy plus hormone therapy for biochemical relapse after definitive local therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The impact of hegemonic masculine ideals on self-esteem in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to ADT-naïve patients.', 'Current Status and Future Perspective on the Management of Lymph Node-Positive Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prostate cancer dormancy and recurrence.', 'Cell-cycle risk score more accurately determines the risk for metastases and death in prostatectomy patients compared with clinical features alone.', 'Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: Challenges beyond the guidelines.']"""

However, in vitro results cannot be extrapolated to in vivo tests. Considering that three-dimensional (3D) culture has been one of the best ways to portray the in vivo system of most cell types, it is possible to carry out assays with a great clinical relevance for the analysis of the screening, action and resistance of antitumor drugs.  Objective:   Thus, the objective of the present study was to compare between 2D and 3D cell culture forms to conclude which is the most suitable model for preclinical in vitro drug testing.  Method:   We evaluated the proliferation, genetic expression and chemoresistance of prostate tumor cell lines, PC- 3, LNCaP and DU145. Prostate tumor cell lines PC-3, LNCaP and DU145 were treated with the antineoplastic drugs paclitaxel and docetaxel and evaluated with cytotoxicity, cell proliferation and gene expression assays in 2D and magnetic 3D bioprinting cultures.  Results:   Lower cell proliferation rate, more resistance to paclitaxel and docetaxel and altered gene expression profile was shown in 3D cell culture comparing with its 2D counterpart.

We hypothesized that TMA Gleason score is in agreement with RP pathology and capable of accurately predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR). Data were provided from a multi-institutional Canadian sample of 1333 TMA and RP specimens with complete clinicopathological data. First, rate of agreement between TMA and high-grade Gleason at RP or biopsy and RP was tested. Second, ability of RP, TMA and biopsy to predict BCR was compared.

Treatment side effects, older age, lack of confidence and opportunity to exercise with others in similar circumstances influence this. Our study explored the experiences of people attending a cancer-specific community-based exercise programme (CU Fitter™).  Methods:   A survey distributed to those attending the programme gathered demographic/clinical information, self-reported exercise levels, information provision and barriers to/benefits of exercise.  Results:   Sixty surveys were evaluable from 65/100 returned (62% female, 68% > 60 years, 66% breast/prostate cancer). Most (68%) were receiving treatment. Sixty-eight percent attended classes once or twice weekly. Fifty-five percent received exercise advice after diagnosis, usually from their hospital doctor/nurse. More (73%) had read about exercising, but less used the Internet to source information (32%). Self-reported exercise levels were higher currently than before diagnosis (p = 0.05). Forty-eight percent said their primary barrier to exercising was the physical impact of cancer/treatment. Improving fitness/health (40%) and social support (16%) were the most important gains from the programme. Many (67%) had made other lifestyle changes and intented to keep (50%) or increase (30%) exercising.  Conclusions:   This community-based cancer-specific exercise approach engaged people with cancer and showed physical, psychological, and social benefits.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Community-grown exercise initiatives bring cancer survivors together creating their own supportive environment. Combining this with instructors familiar with the population and providing an open-ended service may prove particularly motivating and beneficial.

Lu-177 is preferred to I-131 in clinical settings, but targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) with 177Lu-PSMA-617 has not reached its full potential due to insufficient dose delivery to the tumor. We recently developed a dual-targeting radioiodinated ligand, RPS-027, that targets PSMA and uses albumin binding to enable good tumor uptake and significantly reduced kidney uptake in a preclinical model. Further development of this ligand is limited by the inability to independently modify PSMA and albumin binding and the requirement of I-131 for therapeutic application. We therefore sought to devise a new class of trifunctional ligands for RLT with (1) a high-affinity PSMA-binding domain, (2) an albumin-binding group (ABG), and (3) a chelator for radiometals such as 68Ga3+, 177Lu3+ and 225Ac3+.  Methods:   Ligands incorporating a triazolylphenylurea-containing PSMA-targeting group, an Nε-(2-(4-iodophenyl)acetyl)lysine ABG and the bifunctional chelator p-SCN-Bn-DOTA linked by a PEG-containing polymer containing 0,3,4,6,8 or 12 repeats were prepared. PSMA affinity was determined in LNCaP cells and uptake and tissue distribution was studied in mice bearing LNCaP tumor xenografts and compared to 177Lu-PSMA-617. Imaging studies were performed up to 24 h post-injection (p.i.) using 66Ga3+ and biodistribution studies at 4 h, 24 h and 96 h p.i. with 177Lu3+.  Results:   PSMA affinity was high (IC50 = 1-10 nM) and inversely proportional to the linker length. Tumor uptake correlated with binding affinity and was significantly greater than for 177Lu-PSMA-617 over 96 h. The highest uptake was achieved with 177Lu-RPS-063 (30.0 ± 6.9 %ID/g; 4 h p.i.). Kidney uptake was generally high, with the exception of the lowest affinity ligand 177Lu-RPS-067. Each of the compounds showed slower blood clearance than 177Lu-PSMA-617, with clearance proportional to linker length.  Conclusions:   The high tumor uptake achieved with these trifunctional ligands predicts larger (up to 4×) doses delivered to the tumor than can be achieved with 177Lu-PSMA-617. Although PSMA-mediated kidney uptake was also observed, the exceptional area under the curve (AUC) in the tumor warrants further investigation of these novel ligands as candidates for RLT.""","""['James Kelly', 'Alejandro Amor-Coarasa', 'Shashikanth Ponnala', 'Anastasia Nikolopoulou', 'Clarence Williams Jr', 'David Schlyer', 'Yize Zhao', 'Dohyun Kim', 'John W Babich']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Implications for Expanding the Therapeutic Window.', 'Enhancing Treatment Efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 with the Conjugation of an Albumin-Binding Motif: Preclinical Dosimetry and Endoradiotherapy Studies.', 'Assessment of PSMA targeting ligands bearing novel chelates with application to theranostics: Stability and complexation kinetics of 68Ga3+, 111In3+, 177Lu3+ and 225Ac3.', 'Third-line treatment and 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', '177Lu-PSMA Radioligand Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeted Alpha-Particle Therapy: A Review of Current Trials.', 'Imageological/Structural Study regarding the Improved Pharmacokinetics by 68Ga-Labeled PEGylated PSMA Multimer in Prostate Cancer.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 theranostic probe for hepatocellular carcinoma imaging and therapy.', 'Preclinical investigations using 177LuLu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA toward its clinical translation for radioligand therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Development and Evaluation of a PSMA-Targeted Nanosystem Co-Packaging Docetaxel and Androgen Receptor siRNA for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

In resource limited countries, patients are at increased risk of being diagnosed late as they are operated for presumed benign prostatic hyperplasia. The information on the magnitude and risk factors of this problem in our setting could assist in the overall optimization of care of patients at risk.  Methods:   A retrospective study of patients who underwent prostatectomy for presumed benign prostatic enlargement was done at Bugando University Hspital in Tanzania. Patients' age, creatinine levels, urological Ultrasound, prostate specific antigen and Biopsy results were analyzed using STATA 11. The prevalence of incidental prostatic cancer was calculated and logistic regression was done for factors associated with incidental prostatic cancer.  Results:   In total, 152 patients were included in this study. The median age was 69 (SD 9.4) years, 16 (10.53%,) and 49 (32.24%) participants had Hydronephrosis and elevated creatinine levels respectively. Eighty six (58.56%) patients had PSA >10 ng/mL and in total; 33 (21.71%) had incidental prostatic carcinoma.

The dose-volume indices were calculated and compared with the original plan in terms of clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (CTV plus a 2-mm margin), rectum, bladder, and urethra. Prostate motions of >3, >5, and >10 mm were observed for 31.3, 9.1, and 0.5% of the 1929 timestamps, respectively. Relative differences between the simulated and original plans were mostly less than 1%. Although significant decreases were observed in D50% and D98% of the target, absolute dose differences were <0.1 Gy compared with the planned dose.

Multiple myeloma cells were found to be especially sensitive to GE. The GE was fractionated using solid-phase extractions, and we identified allicin in one GE fraction; however, growth inhibitory activities were found in several additional fractions. These activities were lost during freeze or vacuum drying, suggesting that the main anti-cancer compounds in GE are volatile. The anti-cancer activity was stable for more than six months in &minus;20 &deg;C. We found that GE enhanced the activities of chemotherapeutics, as well as MAPK and PI3K inhibitors.

Loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression is known to occur in aggressive high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma, but expression in mucinous prostatic adenocarcinoma has not been well characterized. In this study, we sought to analyze PTEN expression in mucinous prostatic adenocarcinoma, prostatic adenocarcinoma with mucinous features, and the adjacent conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma. Cases were obtained from the Urologic Pathology files of 3 major academic institutions. Ninety-two cases were identified. PTEN expression was positive in the mucinous component of 79/92 (86%) cases. Concordant positive expression of PTEN between mucinous prostatic adenocarcinoma, prostatic adenocarcinoma with mucinous features, and the adjacent conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma was present in 60/79 (76%) cases. The fact that 86% of cases of mucinous prostatic adenocarcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma with mucinous features were positive for PTEN despite relatively high Gleason scores is in keeping with the fact that these tumors may be less aggressive than conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma without associated extraluminal mucinous components. In 76% of cases, the expression profiles (PTEN positive or negative) of mucinous prostatic adenocarcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma with mucinous features were similar to those of the adjacent conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma, implying that they may likely be clonal from a molecular standpoint. In addition, it is highly conceivable that the subset of PTEN-negative mucinous tumors may still have a relatively good prognosis due to a different/PTEN-independent protective pathway or mechanism.""","""['Elizabeth C Bertsch', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Liang Cheng', 'Adeboye O Osunkoya']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol""","""['ERG expression in mucinous prostatic adenocarcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma with mucinous features: comparison with conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'MUC2 expression in primary mucinous and nonmucinous adenocarcinoma of the prostate: an analysis of 50 cases on radical prostatectomy.', 'Evaluation of ERG and PTEN protein expression in cribriform architecture prostate carcinomas.', 'Mucin-producing tumors and tumor-like lesions involving the prostate: a comprehensive review.', 'Mucinous and secondary tumors of the prostate.']"""

We were able to recover an average of 79% of 110‑1,100 PC3 and 60‑1,500 LNCaP cells, and detect the p.K139fs*3 deletion of the p53 gene in PC3 cells and p.T877A mutation of the androgen receptor gene in LNCaP cells. Next, we spiked these two types of cells into normal donor blood samples, captured the cells and analyzed them using PCR amplicon sequencing. The PC3 and LNCaP cells were captured and retrieved with the ratio of captured CTCs to the background leukocytes reaching 1:1.5 for PC3 and 1:2.9 for LNCaP cells. We further revealed that the p.K139fs*3 deletion and p.T877A mutation can be detected in the captured PC3 and LNCaP cells, respectively. We successfully validated this approach using clinical blood samples from patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Our results demonstrated a novel approach for CTC enrichment and illustrated the potential of CTC molecular characterization for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment selection of patients with metastatic malignancy.""","""['Ruqin Kou', 'Jian Zhao', 'Priya Gogoi', 'Shannon Carskadon', 'Will Chow', 'Clara Hwang', 'Nallasivam Palanisamy', 'Conrad Leung', 'Yixin Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Microfluidic-Based Enrichment and Retrieval of Circulating Tumor Cells for RT-PCR Analysis.', 'Molecular Profiling of Pooled Circulating Tumor Cells from Prostate Cancer Patients Using a Dual-Antibody-Functionalized Microfluidic Device.', 'Characterization of a novel automated microfiltration device for the efficient isolation and analysis of circulating tumor cells from clinical blood samples.', 'Technologies for circulating tumor cell separation from whole blood.', 'Microfluidic Devices for Circulating Tumor Cells Isolation and Subsequent Analysis.', 'Laser transfer for circulating tumor cell isolation in liquid biopsy.', 'Microfluidics applications for high-throughput single cell sequencing.', 'Single-Cell Analysis of BRAFV600E and NRASQ61R Mutation Status in Melanoma Cell Lines as Method Generation for Circulating Melanoma Cells.', 'Circulating tumor cells after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are related with recurrence in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'A Novel Liquid Biopsy Strategy to Detect Small Amounts of Cancer Cells Using Cancer-Specific Replication Adenoviruses.']"""

Studies have suggested that long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNA) may serve a role in the pathophysiological processes of pulmonary fibrosis. However, the potential molecular mechanisms involving the lncRNA, prostate cancer‑associated transcript 29 (lncRNAPCAT29) in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis are yet to be determined. In the present study, the role of lncRNAPCAT29 and the potential signaling mechanism in pulmonary fibrosis progression was investigated. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression levels of lncRNAPCAT29 were downregulated within interstitial lung cells from mice with silica‑induced pulmonary fibrosis. Transfection with lncRNAPCAT29 was associated with upregulated expression of microRNA (miRNA)‑221 and downregulated expression of transforming growth factor‑β1 (TGF‑β1); reduced inflammation and fibrotic progression was also associated with lncRNAPCAT29 transfection. TGF‑β1 expression levels were inhibited within pulmonary fibroblasts due to lncRNAPCAT29 expression; NEDD4 binding protein 2 and Plexin‑A4 expression levels were also suppressed. Analysis of the potential mechanism underlying silica‑induced pulmonary fibrosis revealed that the expression levels of RAS protein activator like 1 (RASAL1) and extracellular signal‑regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) were suppressed due to lncRNAPCAT29 expression. The results of the present study demonstrated that lncRNAPCAT29 induced miRNA‑221 upregulation and TGF‑β1 downregulation. These observations were associated with reduced inflammation and progression of silica‑induced pulmonary fibrosis via the TGF‑β1‑regulated RASAL1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which may serve as a potential target for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.""","""['Xiaoming Liu', 'Shanyu Gao', 'Huile Xu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Inhibition of lncRNA PFRL prevents pulmonary fibrosis by disrupting the miR-26a/smad2 loop.', 'The MIR155 host gene/microRNA-627/HMGB1/NF-κB loop modulates fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition.', 'lncRNA PFAL promotes lung fibrosis through CTGF by competitively binding miR-18a.', 'AGAP2: Modulating TGFβ1-Signaling in the Regulation of Liver Fibrosis.', 'TGF‑β1: Gentlemanly orchestrator in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Review).', 'Epigenetics alternation in lung fibrosis and lung cancer.', 'Mechanistic studies of MALAT1 in respiratory diseases.', 'Extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway and silicosis.', 'The function of non-coding RNAs in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.', 'Identification of Survival-Associated Gene Signature in Lung Cancer Coexisting With COPD.']"""

The present study analyzed the effect of TCM‑1 (an anti‑cancer TCM) on prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, and studied in detail the mechanism of cell death induced by TCM‑1 in vitro and in vivo. From the present results, it was identified for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that TCM‑1 arrested the cell cycle at the G1 phase, decreased cell viability and increased nuclear rupture in a dose‑dependent manner; these effects finally resulted in apoptosis in PCa cells. At the molecular level, the data demonstrated that TCM‑1 competitively acted on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with EGF, and suppressed the auto‑phosphorylation and activity of EGFR. Inhibition of EGFR further suppressed the downstream phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase (PI3K)/RAC‑α serine/threonine‑protein kinase (AKT) and RAF proto‑oncogene serine/threonine‑protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase signaling pathways and resulted in a decrease in the phosphorylated‑forkhead box protein O1 (at Ser256, Thr24 and Ser319) expression level, and induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis by regulating the expression of apoptosis‑and cell cycle‑associated genes. In addition, TCM‑1 markedly inhibited the PI3K/AKT/serine/threonine‑protein kinase mTOR signaling pathway and induced cell autophagy by downregulating the phosphorylation of p70S6K and upregulating the levels of Beclin‑1 and microtubule‑associated protein light chain‑3II. In vivo, the TCM‑1‑treated group exhibited a significant decrease in tumor volume compared with the negative control group in subcutaneous xenograft nude mice by inhibiting EGFR‑associated signaling pathways. Therefore, the bio‑functions of Chinese medicine TCM‑1 in inducing PCa cell growth inhibition, autophagy and apoptosis suggested that TCM‑1 may have clinical potential for the treatment of patients with PCa.""","""['Zhaomeng Wu', 'Qingyi Zhu', 'Yu Zhang', 'Yingying Yin', 'Dan Kang', 'Runyi Cao', 'Qian Tian', 'Shan Lu', 'Ping Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Traditional Chinese Medicine CFF-1 induced cell growth inhibition, autophagy, and apoptosis via inhibiting EGFR-related pathways in prostate cancer.', 'Isorhapontigenin induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis by targeting EGFR-related pathways in prostate cancer.', 'Alisertib induces cell cycle arrest and autophagy and suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR and sirtuin 1-mediated signaling pathways in human pancreatic cancer cells.', 'The PI3K/AKT pathway in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.', 'New light on treatment of cervical cancer: Chinese medicine monomers can be effective for cervical cancer by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.', 'Over-expression of EGFR regulated by RARA contributes to 5-FU resistance in colon cancer.', 'FuFangChangTai Decoction Activates Macrophages via Inducing Autophagy.']"""

Materials and methods:   Medical records of all patients who underwent liver transplant at our hospital between January 2003 and June 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Male patients who were > 40 years old with available pre- and posttransplant serum total prostate-specific antigen levels were included in the study.  Results:   Our study included 36 male patients with a mean age of 54.6 ± 5.3 years (range, 45-73 y) at the time of liver transplant. The mean pretransplant serum total prostate-specific antigen level was 0.75 ± 0.77 ng/mL, which was significantly lower than the mean posttransplant level of 1.29 ± 1.57 ng/mL (P < .05). The pretransplant serum total prostate-specific antigen level was measured a mean of 4.9 ± 5.4 months before liver transplant versus a mean 27.6 ± 16.3 months after transplant. Prostate-specific antigen velocity was 0.2 ng/mL/year. Biochemical tests of liver function, including the mean serum levels of bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and albumin, were normal after liver transplant at 1.37 ± 2.33 mg/dL, 1.22 ± 0.36, and 4.16 ± 0.69 g/dL, respectively.  Conclusions:   Serum prostate-specific antigen levels may decrease in patients with hepatic insufficiency/cirrhosis; therefore, a low serum prostate-specific antigen level may not be a reliable marker for excluding prostate cancer in such patients.

However, the imaging limitations of this technique at the early state of PCa recurrence/metastatic spread are still not well characterized. The aim of this study was to determine the quantitative properties and the fundamental imaging limits of Ga68-PSMA-11-PET/CT in localizing small PCa cell deposits.  Methods:   The human PCa LNCaP cells (PSMA expressing) were grown and collected as single cell suspension or as 3D-spheroids at different cell numbers and incubated with Ga68-PSMA-11. Thereafter, human HCT116 cells (PSMA negative) were added to a total cell number of 2 × 105 cells per tube. The tubes were then pelleted and the supernatant aspirated. A whole-body PET/CT scanner with a clinical routine protocol was used for imaging the pellets inside of a cylindrical water phantom with increasing amounts of background activity. The actual activity bound to the cells was also measured in an automatic gamma counter. Imaging detection limits and activity recovery coefficients as a function of LNCaP cell number were obtained. The effect of Ga68-PSMA-11 mass concentration on cell binding was also investigated in samples of LnCaP cells incubated with increasing concentrations of radioligand.  Results:   A total of 1 × 104 LNCaP cells mixed in a pellet of 2 × 105 cells were required to reach a 50% detection probability with Ga68-PSMA-11-PET/CT without background. With a background level of 1 kBq/ml, between 4 × 105 and 1 × 106 cells are required. The radioligand equilibrium dissociation constant was 27.05 nM, indicating high binding affinity. Hence, the specific activity of the radioligand has a profound effect on image quantification.  Conclusions:   Ga68-PSMA-11-PET detects a small number of LNCaP cells even when they are mixed in a population of non-PSMA expressing cells and in the presence of background. The obtained image detection limits and characteristic quantification properties of Ga68-PSMA-11-PET/CT are essential hallmarks for the individualization of patient management. The use of the standardized uptake value for Ga68-PSMA-11-PET/CT image quantification should be precluded.""","""['Alejandro Sanchez-Crespo', 'Emma Jussing', 'Ann-Charlotte Björklund', 'Katja Pokrovskaja Tamm']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Clinical Utility of Gallium-68 PSMA PET/CT Scan for Prostate Cancer.', 'A PSMA Ligand Labeled with Cobalt-55 for PET Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Advances in prostate-specific membrane antigen PET of prostate cancer.', 'Clinically Applicable Cyclotron-Produced Gallium-68 Gives High-Yield Radiolabeling of DOTA-Based Tracers.', 'Intra-individual dynamic comparison of 18F-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 in LNCaP xenograft bearing mice.', 'Detection limit of 89Zr-labeled T cells for cellular tracking: an in vitro imaging approach using clinical PET/CT and PET/MRI.', 'The Continuing Evolution of Molecular Functional Imaging in Clinical Oncology: The Road to Precision Medicine and Radiogenomics (Part I).']"""

Objective:   To describe the incidence, time of onset, and time range of PP following stereotactic body radiation therapy in patients treated for spinal metastases from either prostate cancer (PC) or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and associated predictive factors.  Methods:   A retrospective study was conducted on our institution's cancer database from 2009 to 2015. Selection was based on single level, no prior radiation or surgery, ≥2 follow-up spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and metastases arising from either PC or RCC. Gross tumor volume was contoured on pre- and up to 5 posttreatment MRIs. Patients were sorted into groups depending on gross tumor volume response: PP, non-PP, or progressive disease. Clinical and dosimetric variables were compared using either Fisher's exact test or Kruskal-Wallis analyses.  Results:   Forty-three spinal segments from 31 patients were analyzed. RCC and PC patients showed similar incidence of PP (∼37%). Whether the primary was lytic or sclerotic was a significant predictive factor with more PP in the lytic group (P = .0208). There was a trend of earlier PP onset in RCC (within 6-18 mo) as compared to PC; however, PC segments showed more time-confined presentation of PP (9-12 mo).  Conclusion:   There was a higher incidence of PP in lytic compared to sclerotic primary tumor type.

We prospectively followed 160 men diagnosed with HGPIN at biopsy and therefore at high-risk and clinically monitored for PC. Analyses investigated body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), height, fat mass, lean mass percent body fat, NSAIDs, statins, metformin, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia representing metabolic dysregulation on the risk of a PC diagnosis during follow-up. Systemic inflammation was estimated through measurement of 13 plasma cytokine levels. Statin use was significantly linked with overall PC at follow-up [odds ratio (OR) = 0.45, (0.23, 0.91), P = 0.03], with a somewhat stronger link with high-grade [OR = 0.39, (0.15, 1.04), P = 0.06] PC compared with low-grade PC [OR = 0.50, (0.23, 1.12), P = 0.09]. Non-statin cholesterol-lowering medications, BMI, WHR, diabetes, hypertension and percent body fat were not significantly associated with PC. Although blood IL-12p70, IL-2 and IL-1β levels were significantly lower among statin users, inflammatory markers were not significantly linked with PC and did not explain the observed relationship between statins and lower PC risk. In summary, this prospective study of HGPIN patients at high risk for PC finds that statin use was significantly associated with reduced risk of PC detection at follow-up. Systemic markers of inflammation did not mediate this association, suggesting that statins affect PC progression through alternative pathways.""","""['Jay H Fowke', 'Saundra S Motley']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Association between biomarkers of obesity and risk of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer--evidence of effect modification by prostate size.', 'The associations between statin use and prostate cancer screening, prostate size, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and prostate cancer.', 'Low testosterone level predicts prostate cancer in re-biopsy in patients with high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Current significance of the finding of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in the prostate biopsy.', 'In situ and intraductal epithelial proliferations of prostate: definitions and treatment implications.

Computed tomography (CT) images, if available, can be a valuable resource for individualizing the dosimetry, because they describe the specific anatomy of the patient. However, CT images acquired for radiation treatment planning purposes cover only a portion of the body near the target volume, whereas for epidemiology, the interest lies in the more distant normal tissues, which may be located outside the scan range. To address this challenge, we developed a novel method, called the Anatomically Predictive Extension (APE), to extend a partial-body CT image stack using images of a computational human phantom matched to the patient based on their height and weight. To test our method, we created five APE phantoms from chest and abdominal images extracted from the chest-abdomen-pelvis (CAP) CT scans of five patients. Organ doses were calculated for simple chest and prostate irradiations that were planned on the reference computational phantom (assumed patient geometry if no CT images are available), APE phantoms (patient-phantom hybrid given a partial-body patient CT) and full patient CAP CT scans (ground truth). The APE phantoms and patient CAP CT scans resulted in nearly identical dosimetry for those organs that were fully included in the partial-body CT used to construct the APE. The calculated doses to these same organs in the reference phantoms differed by up to 20% and 52% for the chest and prostate cases, respectively. For organs outside the scan coverage, the reference phantom showed, on average, dose differences of 31% (chest case) and 41% (prostate case). For the APE phantoms, these values were 26% (chest) and 17% (prostate). The APE method combines patient and phantom images to improve organ dosimetry both inside and outside the scan range. We intend to use the APE method for estimating dose for organs peripheral to the treatment fields; however, this method is quite generalizable with many potential applications.""","""['Gleb A Kuzmin', 'Matthew M Mille', 'Jae Won Jung', 'Choonik Lee', 'Christopher Pelletier', 'Gamal Akabani', 'Choonsik Lee']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiat Res""","""['Automatic organ completion with image stitching for personalized radiation dosimetry in CT examinations.', 'Evaluating the impact of extended field-of-view CT reconstructions on CT values and dosimetric accuracy for radiation therapy.', 'Hybrid computational phantoms of the 15-year male and female adolescent: applications to CT organ dosimetry for patients of variable morphometry.', 'Comparison of organ dosimetry methods and effective dose calculation methods for paediatric CT.', 'Radiation dosage of various CT techniques in diagnostic lung imaging.', 'Body region-specific 3D age-scaling functions for scaling whole-body computed tomography anatomy for pediatric late effects studies.', 'Development of whole-body representation and dose calculation in a commercial treatment planning system.', 'A dose voxel kernel method for rapid reconstruction of out-of-field neutron dose of patients in pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy.', 'Conversion of computational human phantoms into DICOM-RT for normal tissue dose assessment in radiotherapy patients.', 'Automatic Mapping of CT Scan Locations on Computational Human Phantoms for Organ Dose Estimation.']"""

The robotic surgery can be improved by laparoscopic tricks. We show a video of robotic adenomectomy where a laparoscopic dissector is used to help create the plan between prostatic capsule and adenoma.  Materials and methods:   A 62 years old male had severe urinary flow outlet obstruction. Medical therapy was not effective. Ultrasound detected a 92gr enlarged prostate with a large middle lobe. Robotic assisted adenomectomy was scheduled. The procedure followed this sequence: opening of Retzius space, superficial suture of the Dorsal vein complex, horizontal cistotomy. The plan was created with electrocautery and blunt dissection with the laparoscopic dissector. Haemostatic sutures were placed between prostate fossa and the posterior bladder neck and closure of the cistotomy.  Results:   Whole operation time was 160 minutes, with a blood loss of 80cc. There was no perioperative or post-operative complication. Catheter was removed after 4 days. Post-operatory uroflowmetry shows a peak flow of 30ml/sec. Pathological examination is negative for tumor. After 60 days IPSS was 8.  Conclusion:   Robotic prostate adenomectomy using the laparoscopic dissector is a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment for benign prostatic enlargement.

Materials and methods:   This was a retrospective study including patients who received biopsies after an abnormal PSA measurement from October 2008-December 2015. Patients with previously diagnosed prostate cancer were excluded. Chi-square tests of independence, two sample t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Fisher's exact tests were performed.  Results:   There were 202 and 208 patients in the pre-USPSTF and post-USPSTF recommendation cohorts, respectively. The post-USPSTF cohort had higher median PSA (7.8 versus 7.1ng/mL, p=0.05), greater proportion of patients who were black (96.6% versus 90.5%, p=0.01), and greater percentage of biopsy cores positive for disease (58% versus 29.5%, p<0.001). Multivariable analysis supported that the increase in PSA was independent of the increase in the proportion of patients who were black. The proportion of patients who were classified as D'Amico intermediate and high-risk disease increased in the post-USPSTF cohort and approached statistical significance (70.1% versus 58.8%, p=0.12).  Conclusions:   Our study suggests that the USPSTF recommendations may have led to na increase in pre-biopsy PSA as well as greater volume of disease.

We designed and characterized a novel nanoparticle containing an antiandrogen, enzalutamide. Selectivity and enhanced efficacy was achieved through coating the particle with PSMA. The PSMA-conjugated nanoparticle was internalized selectively in AR expressing prostate cancer cells. It did not elicit an inflammatory effect. The efficacy of enzalutamide was not compromised through insertion into the nanoparticle; in fact, lower systemic drug concentrations of enzalutamide resulted in comparable clinical activity. Normal muscle cells were not impacted by the PSMA-conjugated containing antiandrogen.

Aims:   To evaluate the ability of 1.5 T magnetic field mpMRI-targeted Prostate Biopsies (PBx) in predicting PC in comparison with blind 24-core saturation PBx (sPBx).  Methods:   We prospectively collected data from patients undergoing transrectal sPBx and, if needed, targeted PBx of suspected lesions based on the 16-'region-of-interest' (ROI) PI-RADS graph. Data remodeling: for each 'target' (each suspected lesion at mpMRI), we identified all the 16 'ROIs' into which the lesion extended: these single 'ROIs' were identified as 'macro-targets'. For each 'ROI' and 'macro-target', we compared the mpMRI result with that of a saturation and targeted biopsy (if performed).  Results:   1.5T mpMRI showed a PI-RADS value ≥ 3 in 101 patients (82.1%). We found a PC in 50 (40.6%). Negative-positive predictive values for mpMRI were 82-45%, respectively. Of the 22 patients with normal mpMRI, four had a PC, but none had a clinically significant cancer. After the data remodeling, we demonstrated the presence of PC in 228 'ROIs': (a) only in targeted biopsies in 15 'ROIs'/'macro-targets' (6.6%); (b) only in sPBx in 177 'ROIs' (77.6%); (c) in both targeted and sPBx in 36 'ROIs' (15.8%).  Discussion:   81.8% of patients with normal 1.5T mpMRI were negative at PBx. Performing only targeted PBx may lead to lack of PC diagnosis in about 50% of patients.

To date, a variety of microRNAs have been demonstrated to serve key functions in the progression and development of NPC. microRNA-425 (miR-425) has previously been reported to be frequently abnormally expressed in a number of different types of human cancer, including lung, gastric, cervical, breast and prostate cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, the expression patterns, functions and underlying mechanisms of miR-425 in NPC remain largely unexplored. In the present study, the expression of miR-425 was revealed to be low in NPC tissues and cell line. Resumption of miR-425 expression suppressed cell viability and invasion in NPC. Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) was identified as a direct target gene of miR-425 in NPC. HDGF was highly expressed at mRNA and protein levels in NPC tissues. Additionally, HDGF mRNA was negatively correlated with miR-425 expression in NPC tissues. Furthermore, overexpression of HDGF almost completely rescued the tumor-suppressing effects of miR-425 on NPC cell viability and invasion.

In this work, an untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomic profiling of PCa cells was performed to prove the concept that metabolic alterations might differentiate PCa cell lines from normal prostate cell line. For that, we assessed the differences in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) profile in the extracellular medium (exometabolome) of four PCa cell lines and one normal prostate cell line at two pH values (pH 2 and 7) by GC-MS. Multivariate analysis revealed a panel of volatile metabolites that discriminated cancerous from normal prostate cells. The most altered metabolites included ketones, aldehydes and organic acids. Among these, we highlight pentadecane-2-one and decanoic acid, which were significantly increased in PCa compared to normal cells, and cyclohexanone, 4-methylheptan-2-one, 2-methylpentane-1,3-diol, 4-methylbenzaldehyde, 1-(3,5-dimethylfuran-2-yl)ethanone, methyl benzoate and nonanoic acid, which were significantly decreased in PCa cells.

To further validate AMPK's role in TRAIL sensitization, we determined the apoptotic potential of TRAIL in combination with the natural compound Berberine (BBR), the latter being a potent activator of AMPK. These demonstrated a significant reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptosis (increased cleavage of caspase 3, 8, 9) when treated with TRAIL-BBR combination. This apoptosis is attenuated in cells overexpressing AMPKα-dominant negative (DN) or following AMPKα knockdown, confirming involvement of AMPK. To identify potential downstream mediators involved, an apoptosis RT2 PCR array analysis was performed. These showed induction of several genes including TNFRSF10B (expresses DR5) and Harakiri following BBR treatment, which were further validated by qPCR analysis.

We assessed PSA testing and biopsy rates before and after policy implementation among patients of ACO and non-ACO-aligned physicians. To control for secular trends, difference-in-differences methods were used to determine the effects of ACO implementation.  Results:   We identified 1.1 million eligible men without prostate cancer. From 2011 to 2014, the rates of PSA testing and biopsy declined by 22.3% and 7.0%, respectively. PSA testing declined similarly regardless of ACO participation-from 618 to 530 tests per 1000 beneficiaries among ACO-aligned physicians and from 607 to 516 tests per 1000 beneficiaries among non-ACO-aligned physicians (difference-in-differences P = .11). Whereas rates of prostate biopsy remained constant for patients of non-ACO-aligned physicians at 12 biopsies per 1000 beneficiaries, these rates increased from 11.6 to 12.5 biopsies per 1000 beneficiaries of patients of ACO-aligned physicians (difference-in-differences P = .03).

Information on the use of raloxifene and tamoxifen for breast cancer risk reduction in the general population indicates that the risk is believed to be low; however, there is little literature.  Objective:   The purpose of this study was to assess the use of breast cancer risk reduction medications by breast cancer risk level in an older cohort of women.  Study design:   Women who were enrolled in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial were assessed for the use of raloxifene, tamoxifen, and other medications. The data sources for use of the drugs were a mailed medication use questionnaire in 2013 and linked Medicare Part D claims files from 2010-2014. Estimated breast cancer risk within 5 years was assessed with the use of the modified Gail model and self-reported breast cancer risk factors; comorbidities were assessed through a questionnaire.  Results:   A total of 22,235 women completed the medication use questionnaire; of these, 13,640 women (61%) had linked Part D data. In 2013, 45% of the women were 65-74 years old, and 55% of the women were 75-84 years old.

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of radiotherapy on QoL in men aged 75 years or older treated with radiotherapy for a localized prostate cancer, and to identify predictors of reduced QoL.  Patients and methods:   We prospectively administered a battery of geriatric (MNA, GDS, Get up and Go Test, CIRS-G, ADL, IADL, MMSE), toxicity (IPSS; IIEF 5), and QoL (QLQ C30) screening tests in 100 elderly patients before and two months after prostate cancer radiotherapy (NCT 02876237). Patients ≥ 75 years undergoing radiotherapy with a curative intent for localized prostate cancer with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADL) were eligible for study inclusion. Correlations between patient-assessed QoL and tumor characteristics, radiotherapy treatment or CGA parameters were sought using the Fisher or the Mann and Whitney tests. Changes in QoL parameters over time were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.  Results:   At study entry, scores for IADL impairments were present in 51%, reduced autonomy in activities of daily living in 16%, cognitive impairment found in 20%, depression-related symptoms in 31%, and 66% of patients had significant co-morbidities. Eight percent were judged to be at risk of fall and 2% were found to be undernourished. Severely impaired (IPSS ≥ 20) urinary function was observed in 11.2% and 13.5% of patients before and two months after completion of radiotherapy respectively. Significantly decreased QoL (> 20 points) at two months after treatment was found in 13% of patients and a moderate but clinically relevant reduction (10 to 20 points) in 17% of patients. No tumor characteristic, treatment, or oncogeriatric parameter was predictive of reduced QoL following prostate cancer radiotherapy.  Conclusion:   Despite sometimes markedly diminished oncogeriatric parameters, prostate cancer radiotherapy was generally well tolerated in these elderly patients. We found no predictive factor to determine which patients would experience impaired quality of life following radiotherapy.""","""['Aurore Goineau', 'Loïc Campion', ""Bénédicte d'Aillières"", 'Brigitte Vié', 'Agnès Ghesquière', 'Guillaume Béra', 'Didier Jaffres', 'Guy de Laroche', 'Nicolas Magné', 'Xavier Artignan', 'Jérôme Chamois', 'Philippe Bergerot', 'Etienne Martin', 'Gilles Créhange', 'Elisabeth Deniaud-Alexandre', 'Xavier Buthaud', 'Yazid Belkacémi', 'Mélanie Doré', 'Laure de Decker', 'Stéphane Supiot']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Can Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Predict Tolerance of Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer in Men Aged 75 Years or Older?', 'Comparison of self-estimation of disuric disorders gauged IPSS scale and qualities of lives QoL with self-estimation of sexual life gauged by IIEF-5 scale.', 'Independence and health related quality of life in 200 onco-geriatric surgical patients within 6 months of follow-up: Who is at risk to lose?', 'Hypofractionnated radiotherapy for elderly patients with prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of Frailty Syndrome in Men with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Scoping Review.', 'Geriatric assessment in the older adult with genitourinary cancer: A narrative review.', 'Optimal assessment of quality of life for patients with prostate cancer.', 'Associations among frailty and quality of life in older patients with cancer treated with chemotherapy.', ""Impact of Androgen Deprivation Therapy Associated to Conformal Radiotherapy in the Treatment of D'Amico Intermediate-/High-Risk Prostate Cancer in Older Patients."", 'Personalised treatment for older adults with cancer: The role of frailty assessment.']"""

It comprises two of the most common histological tumor types: squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma. SCC accounts for about 90% of esophageal cancers. Despite developments in treatment strategies, the prognosis and survival rate remain poor. Podocalyxin (PODXL) is a highly glycosylated type-I transmembrane protein. It is expressed in normal tissues such as kidney, heart, breast, and pancreas. Upregulation of PODXL correlates with tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. Therefore, this glycoprotein could be a potential biomarker for predicting the prognosis of some cancers, for instance, brain, colorectal, oral, lung, bladder, prostate, and ovarian cancers. We previously developed a specific and sensitive anti-PODXL monoclonal antibody (mAb), PcMab-47 (mouse IgG1, kappa) and its mouse IgG2a-type (47-mG2a). We showed their utility in immunohistochemical analysis of oral cancers. Herein, we demonstrate that PcMab-47 and 47-mG2a can also be used to detect esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with this technique. These two antibodies, respectively, stained 123/130 (94.6%) and 127/130 (97.7%) ESCC cases, indicating that they can detect PODXL with high sensitivity in this carcinoma. Of more than 3+ cases, 47-mG2a was more effective than PcMab-47, respectively, staining 56/127 (44.1%) and 41/123 (33.3%).

Methods:   This study retrospectively included 22 patients (mean age, 53.9 years) with biopsy-proven cervical cancer who underwent pelvic MR imaging including conventional DWI and reduced FOV DWI before therapy. Two observers independently rated image quality for reduced FOV DWI and conventional DWI regarding anatomic detail, lesion conspicuity, presence of artifacts, and overall image quality using the following 4-point scale. Quantitative analysis was performed by measuring the ADC value of the tumor. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare qualitative scores and mean ADC value between two DWI sequences.  Results:   Reduced FOV DWI achieved significantly better anatomic detail, lesion conspicuity, presence of artifacts, and overall image quality compared to conventional DWI (p < 0.05).

The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial assessed testing for four cancers simultaneously and can be viewed as a multiphasic cancer intervention. This paper presents overall and multiphasic findings of this trial.  Methods:   The PLCO trial was a randomized multi-center trial conducted at ten screening centers in the US. Participants were 76,682 men and 78,215 women ages 55 - 74 and free of the target cancers at trial entry. Screening tests were PSA and digital rectal examination for prostate cancer, chest x-ray for lung cancer, flexible sigmoidoscopy for colorectal cancer, CA125 and transvaginal ultrasound for ovarian cancer. Outcomes and harms of screening were assessed including compliance, test results, incidence, mortality, false positives and overdiagnosis.  Results:   Screening compliance was 82%, 72,820 (8%) of 906,064 exams were positive, the overall PPV was 4.2% and the cancer detection rate was 3.38/1000. A mortality reduction was observed only for colorectal cancer (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 - 0.85) with no effect on all-cause mortality. Ninety-six percent of positive exams were falsely positive and there was a suggestion of overdiagnosis of prostate and possibly ovarian cancers. Multiphasic testing resulted in 7374 men and 2748 women experiencing multiple false positive results from multiple types of tests.  Conclusion:   Multiphasic cancer screening led to reduced mortality for one target cancer and imposed a burden on the health care system that included substantial false positives and likely overdiagnosis.""","""['Philip C Prorok', 'Patrick Wright', 'Thomas R Riley', 'Barnett S Kramer', 'Christine D Berg', 'John K Gohagan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Rev Recent Clin Trials""","""['Design of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.', 'The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial of the National Cancer Institute: history, organization, and status.', 'Assessing contamination and compliance in the prostate component of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial: Background, Goals, Organization, Operations, Results.', 'Effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality: long-term follow-up of the randomised US PLCO cancer screening trial.']"""

Our previous study demonstrates that δ-catenin increases the stability of EGFR in prostate cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanism behind δ-catenin-mediated enhanced stability of EGFR was not explored. In this study, we hypothesized that δ-catenin enhances the protein stability of EGFR by inhibiting its lysosomal degradation that is mediated by c-casitas b-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl), a RING domain E3 ligase. c-Cbl monoubiquitinates EGFR and thus facilitates its internalization, followed by lysosomal degradation.

It is a well-known precursor to numerous microbial secondary metabolites and pharmaceuticals, including anticancer agents, immunosuppressants, and several antibiotics. Lysine cyclodeaminase (LCD) catalyzes β-deamination of L-lysine into L-pipecolic acid using β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor. Expression of a human homolog of LCD, μ-crystallin, is elevated in prostate cancer patients. To understand the structural features and catalytic mechanisms of LCD, we determined the crystal structures of Streptomyces pristinaespiralis LCD (SpLCD) in (i) a binary complex with NAD+, (ii) a ternary complex with NAD+ and L-pipecolic acid, (iii) a ternary complex with NAD+ and L-proline, and (iv) a ternary complex with NAD+ and L-2,4-diamino butyric acid. The overall structure of SpLCD was similar to that of ornithine cyclodeaminase from Pseudomonas putida. In addition, SpLCD recognized L-lysine, L-ornithine, and L-2,4-diamino butyric acid despite differences in the active site, including differences in hydrogen bonding by Asp236, which corresponds with Asp228 from Pseudomonas putida ornithine cyclodeaminase. The substrate binding pocket of SpLCD allowed substrates smaller than lysine to bind, thus enabling binding to ornithine and L-2,4-diamino butyric acid. Our structural and biochemical data facilitate a detailed understanding of substrate and product recognition, thus providing evidence for a reaction mechanism for SpLCD. The proposed mechanism is unusual in that NAD+ is initially converted into NADH and then reverted back into NAD+ at a late stage of the reaction.""","""['Kyungjin Min', 'Hye-Jin Yoon', 'Atsushi Matsuura', 'Yong Hwan Kim', 'Hyung Ho Lee']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Cells""","""['Studies of lysine cyclodeaminase from Streptomyces pristinaespiralis: Insights into the complex transition NAD+ state.', 'Ornithine cyclodeaminase: structure, mechanism of action, and implications for the mu-crystallin family.', 'Biochemical characterisation of recombinant Streptomyces pristinaespiralis L-lysine cyclodeaminase.', 'Biosynthesis of pipecolic acid by RapL, a lysine cyclodeaminase encoded in the rapamycin gene cluster.', 'The ammonia-lyases: enzymes that use a wide range of approaches to catalyze the same type of reaction.', 'Interconnected Set of Enzymes Provide Lysine Biosynthetic Intermediates and Ornithine Derivatives as Key Precursors for the Biosynthesis of Bioactive Secondary Metabolites.', 'Optimization of the precursor supply for an enhanced FK506 production in Streptomyces tsukubaensis.', 'Imine reduction by an Ornithine cyclodeaminase/μ-crystallin homolog purified from Candida parapsilosis ATCC 7330.']"""

Methods:   Human PCa cell lines PC3, DU145, and LNCaP were treated with various concentrations of esculetin for 24 to 72 hours, and cell viability was determined by the MTT test. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by using cell-based cytometer.

The protein expression was measured by Western blotting.  Results:   Esculetin inhibited cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cell migration was inhibited by esculetin treatment. Administration of esculetin significantly reduced the cells survival, induced apoptosis and caused the G1 phase cell cycle arrest shown by image-based cytometer. The induced expression of cytochrome c, p53, p21 and p27, and down-regulated CDK2 and CDK4 may be the underlying molecular mechanisms of esculetin effect.

Rapidly expanding treatment options for CRPC provide reasonable alternatives for those who are resistant to docetaxel. Therefore, prediction of docetaxel resistance has become of great clinical importance. Syndecan-1 (SDC1) has been currently shown to be involved in chemotherapy resistance in various malignancies including prostate cancer. The predicting value of serum SDC1 level has not been evaluated yet.  Patients and methods:   We assessed the baseline levels of SDC1 in serum samples of 75 patients with CRPC who received docetaxel therapy until the appearance of therapy resistance. In one patient who was treated with three treatment series, we assessed also 6 additional serum samples collected during a 1-year treatment period. Serum SDC1 levels were correlated with clinical outcomes as well as with serum levels of MMP7.  Results:   Pretreatment SDC1 serum levels were not associated with patients' age, the presence of bone or visceral metastases. In univariable analyses, patients' performance status, the presence of bone or visceral metastases, high pretreatment prostate specific antigen and SDC1 levels were significantly associated with cancer-specific survival. In multivariable analysis patients' performance status (P = 0.005), presence of bone or visceral metastases (P = 0.013) and high SDC1 level (P = 0.045) remained independent predictors of patients' survival. In the patient with available follow-up samples serum SDC1 level increased from 50 to 300ng/ml at radiographic progression. Serum concentrations of SDC1 were correlated with those of MMP7 (r = 0.420, P = 0.006).  Conclusions:   Our present results together with currently published data suggest a role for SDC1 shedding in chemotherapy resistance.

The cross-talk between metastatic cancer cells and bone is critical to the development and progression of bone metastases. In our previous data, we have described how the involvement of the Wnt-induced secreted protein-1/vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (WISP-1/VCAM-1) system in this tumor-bone interaction contributes to human PCa cell motility. In this study, we found that WISP-1 regulates bone mineralization by inducing bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2), BMP4 and osteopontin (OPN) expression in osteoblasts. We also found that WISP-1 inhibited RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, osteoblast-derived WISP-1 enhanced VCAM-1 expression in PCa cells and subsequently promoted the adherence of cancer cells to osteoblasts. Furthermore, endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression in PCa cells was regulated by osteoblast-derived WISP-1, which promoted integrin α4β1 expression in osteoblasts via the MAPK pathway. Pretreatment of PCa cells with VCAM-1 antibody or osteoblasts with integrin α4β1 antibody attenuated the adherence of PCa cells to osteoblasts, suggesting that integrin α4β1 serves as a ligand that captures VCAM-1+ metastatic tumor cells adhering to osteoblasts.

Materials and methods:   Fifty-four participants (32 healthy subjects and 22 patients) were scanned with WB-DWI methods using a 3T MRI scanner. Axial, sagittal, or coronal fat-suppressed T2-weighted (T2WI), T1-weighted (T1WI), and DWI images were acquired. Total MRI acquisition and set-up time was approximately 45 minutes. Metastatic disease on MRI was confirmed based on T2WI characteristics. The number of lesions was established on computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET-CT). Whole-body ADC maps and T2WI were constructed, and region-of-interests were drawn in normal and abnormal-appearing tissue for quantitative analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a paired t tests and P < .05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   There were 91 metastatic lesions detected from the CT or PET-CT with a missed recurrent lesion in the prostate. Multiparametric WB-MRI had excellent sensitivity (96%) for detection of metastatic lesions compared to CT. ADC map values and the ADC ratio in metastatic bone lesions were significantly increased (P < .05) compared to normal bone. In soft tissue, ADC map values and ratios in metastatic lesions were decreased compared to normal soft tissue.

Studies by our group suggest that quantitative ultrasound (QUS) could provide a more sensitive means of targeting biopsies and directing focal treatments to cancer-suspicious regions in the prostate. Previous studies have utilized ultrasound signals at typical clinical frequencies, i.e., in the 6-MHz range. In the present study, a 29-MHz, TRUS, micro-ultrasound system and transducer (ExactVu micro-ultrasound, Exact Imaging, Markham, Canada) was used to acquire radio frequency data from 163 patients immediately before 12-core biopsy procedures, comprising 1956 cores. These retrospective data are a subset of data acquired in an ongoing, multisite, 2000-patient, randomized, clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02079025). Spectrum-based QUS estimates of effective scatter diameter (ESD), effective acoustic concentration (EAC), midband (M), intercept (I) and slope (S) as well as envelope statistics employing a Nakagami distribution were used to train linear discriminant classifiers (LDCs) and support vector machines (SVMs). Classifier performance was assessed using area-under-the-curve (AUC) values obtained from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses with 10-fold cross validation. A combination of ESD and EAC parameters resulted in an AUC value of 0.77 using a LDC. When Nakagami-µ or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values were added as features, the AUC value increased to 0.79. SVM produced an AUC value of 0.77, using a combination of envelope and spectral QUS estimates.

Patients and methods:   Patients with LNM after RP were identified using the National Cancer Database (2004-2013). Exclusion criteria included any use of radiation therapy or ADT before RP, clinical M1 disease, or incomplete follow-up data. Patients were categorised according to postoperative management strategy. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were employed. Sub-analyses further evaluated patient risk stratification and time to receipt of adjuvant therapy.  Results:   A total of 8 074 patients met the inclusion criteria. Postoperatively, 4 489 (55.6%) received observation, 2 065 (25.6%) ADT, and 1 520 (18.8%) ADT + EBRT. The mean (median; interquartile range) follow-up was 52.3 (48.0; 28.5-73.5) months. Patients receiving ADT or ADT + EBRT had higher pathological Gleason scores, T-stage, positive surgical margin rates, and nodal burden. Adjusted multivariable Cox models showed improved OS for ADT + EBRT vs observation (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.94; P = 0.008) and vs ADT (HR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63-0.93; P = 0.007). There was no difference in OS for ADT vs observation (HR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.87-1.18; P = 0.88). Findings were similar when restricting adjuvant cohorts for timing of adjuvant therapy. There was no difference in OS between groups for up to 2 549 (31.6%) patients lacking any of the following adverse features: ≥pT3b disease, Gleason score ≥9, three or more positive nodes, or positive surgical margin.  Conclusions:   For patients with LNM after RP, the use of adjuvant ADT + EBRT improved OS in the majority of patients, especially those with adverse pathological features. Conversely, adjuvant therapy did not confer significant OS benefit in up to 30% of patients without high-risk features, who may be managed with observation and forego the morbidity associated with immediate ADT or radiation.""","""['Mohit Gupta', 'Hiten D Patel', 'Zeyad R Schwen', 'Phuoc T Tran', 'Alan W Partin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Postoperative radiation and hormonal therapy for men with node-positive prostate cancer: a new standard?', 'Survival Outcomes of Men with Lymph Node-positive Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: A Comparative Analysis of Different Postoperative Management Strategies.', 'Clinical Outcomes for Patients with Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Adenocarcinoma Treated With Radiotherapy or Radical Prostatectomy: A Multi-institutional Comparative Analysis.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on survival in men treated with radiation for prostate cancer.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Analysis of the surgical approach in prostate cancer staging: results from the surveillance, epidemiology and end results program.', 'Management of Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer.

Chitosan has generated great interest as a useful biopolymer for the encapsulation of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Due to cationic nature, chitosan is able to efficiently encapsulate siRNA molecules and form nanoparticles. Furthermore, the biocompatible and biodegradable attributes of chitosan have paved the way for its potential application in the in vivo delivery of therapeutic siRNAs. In this study, we aimed to design chitosan/CMD nanoparticles for the efficient encapsulation of the anti-cancer drugs SN38 and Snail-specific siRNA.  Methods:   Physicochemical characteristics, growth inhibitory properties, and anti-migratory capacities of the dual delivery of SN38-Snail siRNA CMD-chitosan nanoparticles were investigated in prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Our findings provided evidence for the suggestion that, ChNP-CMD-SN38-siRNA treated cells, the mRNA level of snail decreased from 1.00 to 0.30 (±0.14) and 0.09 (±0.04) after 24h and 48h, respectively.

Materials and methods:   This open-label randomized trial included 38 HRLPC patients who received TGC between July 2011 and March 2013. Within 4 weeks after TGC, subjects were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the 12-month adjuvant ADT or non-adjuvant ADT group. The primary outcome was biochemical failure measured by the Phoenix definition. Adverse events were measured at month 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12. In addition, a cohort of 145 HRLPC patients was selected retrospectively for outcome validation.  Results:   The adjuvant ADT and non-adjuvant ADT groups did't differ in peri-operative characters, such as age, preoperative PSA, tumor stages, Gleason score, prostate size and cryoprobe number. Four patients with adjuvant ADT withdrew from this trial for personal reasons (N = 2), elevated liver function (N = 1) and poorly controlled hyperglycemia (N = 1). In contrast, none in non-adjuvant ADT group experienced adverse events. Biochemical failures were identified in 5 (26%) patients in each group during a median follow-up duration of 45 months.

Methods: In total, 194 patients with clinically suspected recurrence of prostate cancer underwent 11C-choline dynamic PET over the pelvic region (0-8 min), followed by a 6-min static acquisition at about 25 min after injection. Regions of interest were drawn over sites of disease identified by a radiologist with experience in nuclear medicine. 11C-choline uptake and pharmacokinetics were evaluated by SUV, graphical analysis (Patlak plot; KiP), and 1- and 2-compartment pharmacokinetic models (K1, K1/k2, k3, k4, and the macro parameter KiC). Twenty-four local recurrences, 65 metastatic lymph nodes, 19 osseous metastases, and 60 inflammatory lymph nodes were included in the analysis, which was subsequently repeated for regions of interest placed over the gluteus maximus muscle and adipose tissue as a control. Results: SUVmean and KiP were 3.60 ± 2.16 and 0.28 ± 0.22 min-1 in lesions, compared with 2.11 ± 1.33 and 0.15 ± 0.10 min-1 in muscle and 0.26 ± 0.07 and 0.02 ± 0.01 min-1 in adipose tissue. According to the Akaike information criterion, the 2-compartment irreversible model was most appropriate in 85% of lesions and resulted in a K1 of 0.79 ± 0.98 min-1 (range, 0.11-7.17 min-1), a K1/k2 of 2.92 ± 3.52 (range, 0.31-20.00), a k3 of 0.36 ± 0.30 min-1 (range, 0.00-1.00 min-1) and a KiC of 0.28 ± 0.22 min-1 (range, 0.00-1.33 min-1). The Spearman ρ between SUV and KiP, between SUV and KiC, and between KiP and KiC was 0.94, 0.91, and 0.97, respectively, and that between SUV and K1, between SUV and K1/k2, and between SUV and k3 was 0.70, 0.44, and 0.33, respectively. Malignant lymph nodes exhibited a higher SUV, KiP, and KiC than benign lymph nodes. Conclusion: Although 11C-choline pharmacokinetic modeling has potential to uncouple the contributions of different processes leading to intracellular entrapment of 11C-choline, the high correlation between SUV and both KiP and KiC supports the use of simpler SUV methods to evaluate changes in 11C-choline uptake and metabolism for treatment monitoring.""","""['Milan Grkovski', 'Karem Gharzeddine', 'Peter Sawan', 'Heiko Schöder', 'Laure Michaud', 'Wolfgang A Weber', 'John L Humm']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Kinetics of (11)Ccholine uptake in prostate cancer: a PET study.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Standardization of acquisition protocols using PET/CT with 18F-Choline in prostate cancer.', 'Positron emission tomography for prostate, bladder, and renal cancer.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Assessment of the effect of therapy in a rat model of glioblastoma using 18FFDG and 18FFCho PET compared to contrast-enhanced MRI.', 'Slice profile effects on quantitative analysis of hyperpolarized pyruvate.', '18F-Fluorocholine PET uptake correlates with pathologic evidence of recurrent tumor after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases.', 'Optimization of temporal sampling for 18F-choline uptake quantification in prostate cancer assessment.']"""

As part of the biomarker qualification process, we prospectively assessed its reproducibility and repeatability in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Methods: We conducted a prospective multiinstitutional study of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients undergoing 2 (test/retest) 18F-FDHT PET/CT scans on 2 consecutive days. Two independent readers evaluated all examinations and recorded SUVs, androgen receptor-positive tumor volumes, and total lesion uptake for the most avid lesion detected in each of 32 predefined anatomic regions. The relative absolute difference and reproducibility coefficient (RC) of each metric were calculated between the test and retest scans. Linear regression analyses, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate repeatability of 18F-FDHT metrics. The coefficient of variation and ICC were used to assess interobserver reproducibility. Results: Twenty-seven patients with 140 18F-FDHT-avid regions were included. The best repeatability among 18F-FDHT uptake metrics was found for SUV metrics (SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVpeak), with no significant differences in repeatability among them. Correlations between the test and retest scans were strong for all SUV metrics (R2 ≥ 0.92; ICC ≥ 0.97). The RCs of the SUV metrics ranged from 21.3% (SUVpeak) to 24.6% (SUVmax). The test and retest androgen receptor-positive tumor volumes and TLU, respectively, were highly correlated (R2 and ICC ≥ 0.97), although variability was significantly higher than that for SUV (RCs > 46.4%). The prostate-specific antigen levels, Gleason score, weight, and age did not affect repeatability, nor did total injected activity, uptake measurement time, or differences in uptake time between the 2 scans. Including the most avid lesion per patient, the 5 most avid lesions per patient, only lesions 4.2 mL or more, only lesions with an SUV of 4 g/mL or more, or normalizing of SUV to area under the parent plasma activity concentration-time curve did not significantly affect repeatability.

Modifications to the pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) during radical prostatectomy (RP) have been reported to have a therapeutic benefit. The present study is the first to determine if lymph node yield (LNY) is associated with a lower risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) for men with SVI.  Methods:   A total of 220 patients from 2 high-volume institutions who underwent RP without adjuvant treatment between 1990 and 2015 and had prostate cancer with SVI (i.e., pT3b) were identified, and 21 patients did not undergo lymph node dissection. BCR was defined as a postoperative PSA>0.2ng/mL, or use of salvage androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or radiation. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether LNY was predictive of BCR, controlling for PSA, pathologic Gleason Score, pathologic lymph node status, NCCN risk category, etc. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine 3-year freedom from BCR.  Results:   Median number of lymph nodes sampled were 7 (IQR: 3-12; range: 0-35) and 90.5% underwent PLND. The estimated 3-year BCR rate was 43.9%. Results from multivariable analysis demonstrated that LNY was not significantly associated with risk of BCR overall (HR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98-1.03; P = 0.848) for pN0 (HR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.03; P = 0.916) or pN1 patients (HR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.88-1.06; P = 0.468). Overall, PSA (HR = 1.02, P<0.001) and biopsy Gleason sum ≥ 8 (HR = 1.81, P = 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of BCR, and increasing LNY increased the likelihood of detecting>2 positive lymph nodes (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.06-1.65, P = 0.023).

Design, setting, and participants:   Thirty-one consecutive patients with evidence of recurrent PC on 68Ga-PSMA N,N'-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl] ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (68Ga-PSMA-11) PET after radical prostatectomy undergoing 99mTc-PSMA-RGS were retrospectively analyzed.  Surgical procedure:   Salvage surgery with intraoperative radioguidance using a gamma probe was performed after intravenous application of 99mTc-PSMA investigation and surgery (mean activity 571 MBq, mean time to surgery 19.7h).  Measurements:   Radioactive rating (positive vs negative) of resected tissue was compared with the findings of postoperative histopathological analysis. Best prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response without additional treatment was determined after 8-16 wk postoperatively. Biochemical recurrence- and treatment-free survival was evaluated.  Results and limitations:   In total, 132 tissue specimens were removed, of which 58 showed metastatic involvement on histological analysis. On a specimen basis, radioactive rating yielded a sensitivity of 83.6% (confidence interval [CI]: 70.9-91.5%), a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 93.0% (CI: 85.5-96.7%). With 99mTc-PSMA-RGS, all lesions visualized on preoperative 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET could be removed. Moreover, 99mTc-PSMA-RGS detected additional metastases as small as 3mm in two patients. Thirteen patients suffered from complications related to surgery (Clavien-Dindo grade 1: 12 patients; grade 3a: one patient). A PSA reduction below 0.2 ng/ml was observed in 20 patients. Thirteen patients remained biochemical recurrence free after a median follow-up of 13.8 (range: 4.6-18.3) mo. Twenty patients continued to be treatment free after a median follow-up of 12.2 (range: 5.5-18.3) mo.  Conclusions:   As a new technique for surgical guidance, 99mTc-PSMA-RGS is feasible, and has been proved to be of high value for successful intraoperative detection and removal of metastatic lesions in PC patients scheduled for salvage surgery. Its long-term impact on outcome has to be evaluated.  Patient summary:   In this report, we evaluated a novel technique to identify metastatic lesions intraoperatively in patients with recurrent prostate cancer to facilitate surgical removal. After intravenous injection of radioactive molecules that specifically bind to prostate cancer cells that show increased expression of the prostate-specific membrane antigen, we were able to detect and remove these metastatic lesions during surgery. Following salvage surgery, 41.9% of patients remained biochemical recurrence free (median follow-up of 13.8 mo) and 64.5% continued to be treatment free (median follow-up of 12.2 mo).""","""['Tobias Maurer', 'Stephanie Robu', 'Margret Schottelius', 'Kristina Schwamborn', 'Isabel Rauscher', 'Nynke S van den Berg', 'Fijs W B van Leeuwen', 'Bernhard Haller', 'Thomas Horn', 'Matthias M Heck', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Matthias Eiber']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Value of 111 In-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-radioguided surgery for salvage lymphadenectomy in recurrent prostate cancer: correlation with histopathology and clinical follow-up.', 'Robot-assisted Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-radioguided Salvage Surgery in Recurrent Prostate Cancer Using a DROP-IN Gamma Probe: The First Prospective Feasibility Study.', 'Metastases-yield and Prostate-specific Antigen Kinetics Following Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Prostate Cancer: A Comparison Between Conventional Surgical Approach and Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-radioguided Surgery.', 'PSMA-radioguided surgery in localised recurrent prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-radioguided surgery in localized recurrent prostate cancer : Current and future aspects.', 'Sentinel Node Procedure to Select Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Patients with Occult Nodal Metastases for Whole Pelvis Radiotherapy.', 'Clinical advancement of precision theranostics in prostate cancer.', 'Metastasis-directed therapy in solitary oligorecurrent prostate cancer without androgen deprivation therapy-a commentary.', 'Development of in-House Synthesis and Quality Control of 99mTcTc-PSMA-I&S.', 'Synthesis and preclinical evaluation of novel 99mTc-labeled PSMA ligands for radioguided surgery of prostate cancer.']"""

Evidence from a population-based study""","""Background:   Studies on alternative routes to diagnosis stimulated successful policy interventions reducing the number of emergency diagnoses and associated mortality risk. A dearth of evidence on the costs of such interventions might prevent new policies from achieving more ambitious targets.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study on the population of colorectal (88,051), breast (90,387), prostate (96,219), and lung (97,696) cancer patients diagnosed after a GP referral or an emergency presentation and reported in the Cancer Registry of England. Resource use and survival were compared 1 year before and 5 years after diagnosis (3 years for lung), including the costs of GP referrals not converted into a positive diagnosis. Risk-adjusted statistical models were used to calculate the effect of rerouting patient' diagnoses from emergency presentation to GP referral.  Results:   Rerouting a cancer diagnosis results in a relatively small additional costs to the National Health System against additional years of life saved to the patient. The cost per year of life saved is £6456 in colorectal, £1057 in breast, -£662 in prostate (savings), and £819 in lung cancer. Reducing the overall prevalence of emergency presentations to the level achieved by the 20% of Clinical Commissioning Groups with the lowest prevalence would result in £11,481,948 against 1863 years of life saved for Colorectal, £847,750 against 889 years for breast, -£943,434 (cost savings) against 1195 years for prostate, and £609,938 against 1011 years for lung cancer.

Materials and methods:   Fifty tumors imaged using DTI on a 3 T MRI device were analyzed. Regions of interests focusing on the center of tumor foci and noncancerous tissue on the maps of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were used to extract the minimum, the maximum and the mean measures. Measure ratio was computed by dividing tumor measure by noncancerous tissue measure. Logistic regression models were fitted for all possible pair combinations of the measures using 5-fold cross validation.  Results:   Systematic differences are present for all MD measures and also for all FA measures in distinguishing the high risk tumors [GS ≥ 7(4 + 3)] from the low risk tumors [GS ≤ 7(3 + 4)] (P < 0.05). Smaller value for MD measures and larger value for FA measures indicate the high risk. The models enrolling the measures achieve good fits and good classification performances (R2adj = 0.55-0.60, AUC = 0.88-0.91), however the models using the measure ratios perform better (R2adj = 0.59-0.75, AUC = 0.88-0.95). The model that employs the ratios of minimum MD and maximum FA accomplishes the highest sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (Se = 77.8%, Sp = 96.9% and Acc = 90.0%).  Conclusion:   Joint evaluation of MD and FA diffusion tensor imaging measures is valuable to detect high GS risk group peripheral zone prostate tumors. However, use of the ratios of the measures improves the accuracy of the detections substantially.

We sought to identify prognostic criteria in oligometastatic patients undergoing definitive hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT).  Methods:   Exclusively extracranial oligometastatic patients treated with HIGRT were pooled. Characteristics including age, sex, primary tumor type, interval to metastatic diagnosis, number of treated metastases and organs, metastatic site, prior systemic therapy for primary tumor treatment, prior definitive metastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy for metastasis associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treated metastasis control (TMC) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards method. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) identified prognostic risk strata for OS and PFS based on pretreatment factors.  Results:   361 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung (17%), colorectal (19%), and breast cancer (16%). Three-year OS was 56%, PFS was 24%, and TMC was 72%. On multivariate analysis, primary tumor, interval to metastases, treated metastases number, and mediastinal/hilar lymph node, liver, or adrenal metastases were associated with OS.

Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between lower urinary-tract infections, related antibiotics and PCa, whilst adjusting for civil status, education, Charlson Comorbidity Index and time between lower urinary-tract infection and PCa diagnosis.  Results:   It was found that lower urinary-tract infections did not affect PCa risk, however, having a lower urinary-tract infection or a first antibiotic prescription 6-12 months before PCa were both associated with an increased risk of PCa (OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.23-1.82 and 1.96, 1.71-2.25, respectively), as compared to men without lower urinary-tract infections.

Cell morphology was analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, acridine orange/ethidium bromide fluorescence staining, Hoechst 33258 fluorescence staining, and scanning electron microscopy. The mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by flow cytometry following JC-1 staining. The cell apoptosis rate was measured by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometric analysis, and the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was assayed by Western blotting. The results demonstrated that AAP-H induced significant reductions in the number of viable cells and increased cell death in both a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, with an IC50 of approximately 9.605 mM, 7.910 mM, and 2.298 mM at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively.

The mitochondrial membrane potential was markedly decreased, and apoptosis increased after AAP-H treatment. Pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax, cytochrome-C, caspase-3, and caspase-9 were increased, but Bcl-2 was decreased.

Patients and methods:   A total of 445 patients underwent AS in the period 2010-2016 at our institution, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up of 2.4 (1.2-3.7) years. Up to 2014, patients followed a 'pre-2014' AS protocol, which incorporated PB, and subsequently, according to the 2014 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, patients followed a '2014-present' AS protocol that included mpMRI. We identified four groups of patients within the cohort: 'no mpMRI and no PB'; 'PB alone'; 'mpMRI ± TB'; and 'PB and mpMRI ± TB'. Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests were used to compare groups.  Results:   Of 445 patients, 132 (30%) discontinued AS and underwent treatment intervention, with a median (IQR) time to treatment of 1.55 (0.71-2.4) years. The commonest trigger for treatment was PCa upgrading after mpMRI and TB (43/132 patients, 29%). No significant difference was observed in the time at which patients receiving a PB alone or receiving mpMRI ± TB discontinued AS to undergo treatment (median 1.9 vs 1.33 years; P = 0.747). Considering only those patients who underwent repeat biopsy, a greater proportion of patients receiving TB after mpMRI discontinued AS compared with those receiving PB alone (29/66 [44%] vs 32/87 [37%]; P = 0.003). On average, a single set of repeat biopsies was needed to trigger treatment regardless of whether this was a PB or TB.  Conclusions:   Replacing a systematic PB with mpMRI ±TB as part of an AS protocol increased the likelihood of re-classifying patients on AS and identifying men with clinically significant disease requiring treatment. mpMRI ±TB as part of AS thereby represents a significant advance in the oncological safety of the AS protocol.""","""['Richard J Bryant', 'Bob Yang', 'Yiannis Philippou', 'Karla Lam', 'Maureen Obiakor', 'Jennifer Ayers', 'Virginia Chiocchia', 'Fergus Gleeson', 'Ruth MacPherson', 'Clare Verrill', 'Prasanna Sooriakumaran', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Simon F Brewster']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Progression and treatment rates using an active surveillance protocol incorporating image-guided baseline biopsies and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging monitoring for men with favourable-risk prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer undergoing repeat biopsy: a prospective comparison with clinical findings and histopathology.', 'Further reduction of disqualification rates by additional MRI-targeted biopsy with transperineal saturation biopsy compared with standard 12-core systematic biopsies for the selection of prostate cancer patients for active surveillance.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

However, cancer survivors often do not engage in these behaviours. This study aimed to explore barriers and facilitators to engaging in these behaviours following cancer treatment.  Methods:   During the development of a Web-based intervention to enhance health-related quality of life in cancer survivors, 32 people who had completed treatment for breast, colon, or prostate cancer were presented with an intervention for PA and healthy eating. In-depth think-aloud and semi-structured interviewing techniques were used to elicit perceptions of both behaviours. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.  Results:   Some individuals reported implementing positive health behaviour changes to maintain health and prevent recurrence, or to help them to move forward after cancer. However, others reported feeling abandoned, and many did not report an intention to engage in lifestyle changes. Individuals discussed contextual and health-related barriers that were specifically linked to their situation as post-treatment cancer survivors: individuals described uncertainty about how to implement adaptive changes and perceived a lack of support from health care providers. Others viewed behaviour change as unnecessary or undesirable, with some arguing that non-modifiable factors contributed more to their cancer diagnosis than lifestyle-related factors.

In this article, we present the surgical technique and safety and efficacy of the adjustable transobturator male system (ATOMS®) with preattached scrotal port.  Material and method:   An open prospective study was conducted at a university hospital with the main objective of changing the baseline condition after adjustment in the daily pad count and their wet weight (pad test). The secondary objectives were the quality-of-life assessment (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form [ICIQ-SF] and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-7 [IIQ-7], baseline and after the adjustment), patient-perceived results (Patient Global Index [PGI] and Global Response Assessment [GRA] at 1 year) and assessment of complications according to Clavien-Dindo. The numerical values are expressed in median ± IQR.  Results:   We analysed 60 consecutive patients with a follow-up of 21±22 months. The baseline pad-test was 465±450mL, and the pad-count was 5+3 pads/day. The baseline SUI was mild (11.6% of patients), moderate (25%) and severe (63.3%). The operative time was 60±25min, the hospital stay was 1±0 days, and the visual analogue scale of pain on day 1 after surgery was 0±1. The total filling was 16.5±7mL, and the number of refillings was 1±2. The pad-test and pad-count after the adjustment were 0±20mL and 0±1, respectively (both p<.0001 compared with baseline). SUI disappeared (81.7%) or remained mild (11.7%), moderate (5%) or severe (1.6%). We observed a reduction in the ICIQ-SF (p<.0001) and IIQ-7 scores (p=.0003). Both continence (p=.002) and satisfaction (p=.03) were lower in the irradiated patients. Complications occurred in 11 cases (18.6%), 8 (13.5%) of which were grade I and 3 (5.1%) of which were grade 3. The treatment satisfaction rate was 91.7%, and the patient-perceived overall improvement at 1 year was highly pronounced (PGI-I score, 1±1; GRA, 6±1).  Conclusions:   SUI treatment of men using third-generation ATOMS® is safe and effective in the short-term, even in patients with severe SUI. The rate of dry patients after the adjustment exceeded 80%, and the satisfaction rates exceeded 90%.

Men diagnosed with the disease typically undergo radical prostatectomy, which often results in incontinence and impotence. Recurrence of the disease is often experienced by most patients with incomplete prostatectomy during surgery. Hence, the development of a technique that will enable surgeons to achieve a more precise prostatectomy remains an open challenge. In this contribution, we report a theranostic agent (AuNP-5kPEG-PSMA-1-Pc4) based on prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA-1)-targeted gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) loaded with a fluorescent photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug, Pc4. The fabricated nanoparticles are well-characterized by spectroscopic and imaging techniques and are found to be stable over a wide range of solvents, buffers, and media. In vitro cellular uptake experiments demonstrated significantly higher nanoparticle uptake in PSMA-positive PC3pip cells than in PSMA-negative PC3flu cells. Further, more complete cell killing was observed in Pc3pip than in PC3flu cells upon exposure to light at different doses, demonstrating active targeting followed by Pc4 delivery. Likewise, in vivo studies showed remission on PSMA-expressing tumors 14 days post-PDT. Atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed that targeted AuNPs accumulate 4-fold higher in PC3pip than in PC3flu tumors. The nanoparticle system described herein is envisioned to provide surgical guidance for prostate tumor resection and therapeutic intervention when surgery is insufficient.""","""['Joey Dacula Mangadlao', 'Xinning Wang', 'Christopher McCleese', 'Maria Escamilla', 'Gopalakrishnan Ramamurthy', 'Ziying Wang', 'Mukul Govande', 'James P Basilion', 'Clemens Burda']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""ACS Nano""","""['Theranostic Agents for Photodynamic Therapy of Prostate Cancer by Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', 'PSMA-targeted melanin-like nanoparticles as a multifunctional nanoplatform for prostate cancer theranostics.', 'Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Assessment of Carborane-Loaded Theranostic Nanoparticles to Target Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', 'Photosensitiser-gold nanoparticle conjugates for photodynamic therapy of cancer.', 'Clinical trials of cancer therapies targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Global Trends and Research Progress of Photodynamic Therapy in Skin Cancer: A Bibliometric Analysis and Literature Review.', 'Insights on the Dynamic Innovative Tumor Targeted-Nanoparticles-Based Drug Delivery Systems Activation Techniques.', 'Nanoparticles Design for Theranostic Approach in Cancer Disease.', 'A Gold Nanoparticle Bioconjugate Delivery System for Active Targeted Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer and Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: Recent advances, challenges and opportunities.']"""

An understanding of the variants predisposing to more than one cancer type could improve patient care, including screening and genetic counselling, as well as advancing the understanding of tumour development.  Methods:   A cohort of 57 patients ascertained due to their cutaneous melanoma (CM) diagnosis and with a history of two or more additional non-cutaneous independent primary cancer types were recruited for this study. Patient blood samples were assessed by whole exome or whole genome sequencing. We focussed on variants in 525 pre-selected genes, including 65 autosomal dominant and 31 autosomal recessive cancer predisposition genes, 116 genes involved in the DNA repair pathway, and 313 commonly somatically mutated in cancer. The same genes were analysed in exome sequence data from 1358 control individuals collected as part of non-cancer studies (UK10K). The identified variants were classified for pathogenicity using online databases, literature and in silico prediction tools.  Results:   No known pathogenic autosomal dominant or previously described compound heterozygous mutations in autosomal recessive genes were observed in the multiple cancer cohort. Variants typically found somatically in haematological malignancies (in JAK1, JAK2, SF3B1, SRSF2, TET2 and TYK2) were present in lymphocyte DNA of patients with multiple primary cancers, all of whom had a history of haematological malignancy and cutaneous melanoma, as well as colorectal cancer and/or prostate cancer. Other potentially pathogenic variants were discovered in BUB1B, POLE2, ROS1 and DNMT3A. Compared to controls, multiple cancer cases had significantly more likely damaging mutations (nonsense, frameshift ins/del) in tumour suppressor and tyrosine kinase genes and higher overall burden of mutations in all cancer genes.  Conclusions:   We identified several pathogenic variants that likely predispose to at least one of the tumours in patients with multiple cancers. We additionally present evidence that there may be a higher burden of variants of unknown significance in 'cancer genes' in patients with multiple cancer types. Further screens of this nature need to be carried out to build evidence to show if the cancers observed in these patients form part of a cancer spectrum associated with single germline variants in these genes, whether multiple layers of susceptibility exist (oligogenic or polygenic), or if the occurrence of multiple different cancers is due to random chance.""","""['Antonia L Pritchard', 'Peter A Johansson', 'Vaishnavi Nathan', 'Madeleine Howlie', 'Judith Symmons', 'Jane M Palmer', 'Nicholas K Hayward']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Germline Mutations for Novel Candidate Predisposition Genes in Sporadic Schwannomatosis.', 'Evaluation of the contribution of germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 to uveal and cutaneous melanoma.', 'Germline and somatic mutations in patients with multiple primary melanomas: a next generation sequencing study.', 'Investigation of clinically relevant germline variants detected by next-generation sequencing in patients with childhood cancer: a review of the literature.', 'Cutaneous melanoma susceptibility and progression genes.', 'Thyroid Cancer, Neuroendocrine Tumor, Adrenal Adenoma, and Other Tumors in a Patient With a Germline PMS1 Mutation.', 'Comparative Genomics Provides Etiologic and Biological Insight into Melanoma Subtypes.', 'Mutational Characteristics of Primary Mucosal Melanoma: A Systematic Review.', 'Family-based whole-exome sequencing identifies rare variants potentially related to cutaneous melanoma predisposition in Brazilian melanoma-prone families.', 'Molecular analysis of V617F mutation in Janus kinase 2 gene of breast cancer patients.']"""

MiR-17 was found to be significantly reduced in prostate cancer tissues and cells, suggesting that it might be a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer tumorigenesis. Bioinformatics analysis showed the complementary binding site between miR-17 and STAT3. This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-17 in regulating JAK-STAT signaling pathway, as well as prostate cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.  Materials and methods:   Dual luciferase assay was used to verify the targeted relationship between miR-155 and STAT3. LNCaP cells were cultured in vitro and divided into four groups, including mimic NC, miR-17 mimic, si-NC, and si-STAT3 groups. STAT3, p-STAT3, and Bcl-2 expressions were tested by western blot. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Cell proliferation was assessed by EdU staining.  Results:   MiR-17 mimic transfection significantly reduced the relative luciferase activity in HEK293T cells. MiR-17 targeted regulated STAT3 expression.

Neurotransmitters and related neural events have been shown to participate in the development, differentiation, and maintenance of diverse tissues and organs by regulating the specialized cellular function and morphological structures of innervated organs such as the prostate. Here we show that mice lacking both MAO isoforms, MAOA and MAOB, exhibit smaller prostate mass and develop epithelial atrophy in the ventral and dorsolateral prostates. The cellular composition of prostate epithelium showed reduced CK5+ or p63+ basal cells, accompanied by lower Sca-1 expression in p63+ basal cells, but intact differentiated CK8+ luminal cells in MAOA/B-deficient mouse prostates. MAOA/B ablation also decreased epithelial cell proliferation without affecting cell apoptosis in mouse prostates. Using a human prostate epithelial cell line, we found that stable knockdown of MAOA and MAOB impaired the capacity of prostate stem cells to form spheres, coinciding with a reduced CD133+ /CD44+ /CD24- stem cell population and less expression of CK5 and select stem cell markers, including ALDH1A1, TROP2, and CD166. Alternative pharmacological inhibition of MAOs also repressed prostate cell stemness. In addition, we found elevated expression of MAOA and MAOB in epithelial and/or stromal components of human prostate hyperplasia samples compared with normal prostate tissues. Taken together, our findings reveal critical roles for MAOs in the regulation of prostate basal progenitor cells and prostate maintenance.

However, literature on dietary fat and skin cancer has been limited.Methods: We examined the association between fat intake and risk of skin cancer including cutaneous malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) within two prospective studies: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). Dietary information on total, saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, omega-6, and omega-3 fat and cholesterol was repeatedly assessed generally every 4 years. Incident cases were identified by self-report. Diagnosis on melanoma and SCC was confirmed by pathologic records.Results: A total of 794 melanoma, 2,223 SCC, and 17,556 BCC in the NHS (1984-2012) and 736 melanoma, 1,756 SCC, and 13,092 BCC in the HPFS (1986-2012) were documented. Higher polyunsaturated fat intake was associated with risk of SCC [pooled HR for highest vs. lowest quintiles, 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-1.28; Ptrend=0.001] and BCC (pooled HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; Ptrend=0.01). Higher omega-6 fat intake was associated with risks of SCC, BCC, and melanoma. Omega-3 fat intake was associated with risk of BCC, but not with SCC or melanoma. No other fats were associated with melanoma risk. The associations were similar in women and men and by other skin cancer risk factors.Conclusions: Polyunsaturated fat intake was modestly associated with skin cancer risk.Impact: Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to identify relevant biological mechanisms.

Patients and methods:   Clinical data were collected retrospectively in 17 centres in Europe. Eligible patients had undergone rechallenge with cabazitaxel after three previous lines of treatment (DOC, NHT and CABA, in any order). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Data on toxicities were collected.  Results:   A total of 69 of 562 patients (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1 69%) were rechallenged with CABA (25 mg/m2 q3w, 58%; 20 mg/m2 q3w, 27.5%; other, 14.5%) for 1-10 (median 6) cycles; 76.8% received prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.

However, the function of GDF15 in cervical cancer has not yet been reported.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry was used to detect GDF15 expression in normal cervix and in different cervical cancer lesions. Cell growth curves, MTT, tumor formation assays and flow cytometry were utilized to observe the effects of ectopic GDF15 expression on the proliferation and cell cycle of cervical cancer cells. Real-time PCR, western blotting and immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to measure the expression of genes related to the cell cycle and the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to confirm whether C-myc bound to a specific region of the GDF15 promoter. Inhibitor treatment and immunoprecipitation assays were employed to identify the association between GDF15 and ErbB2.  Results:   GDF15 expression gradually increased during the progression of cervical carcinogenesis. GDF15 promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation via exogenous rhGDF15 treatment or the use of gene editing technology in vitro and in vivo and significantly accelerated the cell cycle transition from G0/G1 to S phase. The expression of p-ErbB2, p-AKT1, p-Erk1/2, CyclinD1 and CyclinE1 was up-regulated and the expression of p21 was down-regulated in GDF15-overexpressing and rhGDF15-treated cervical cancer cells. C-myc trans-activated GDF15 expression by binding to the E-box motifs in the promoter of GDF15 and contributed to the positive feedback of GDF15/C-myc/GDF15. Furthermore, GDF15 bound to ErbB2 in a protein complex in cervical cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Our data demonstrated that GDF15 promoted the proliferation of cervical cancer cells via the up-regulation of CyclinD1 and CyclinE1 and the down-regulation of p21 through both the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways in a complex with ErbB2.""","""['Shan Li', 'Yan-Min Ma', 'Peng-Sheng Zheng', 'Ping Zhang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Mechanism of sensitivity to cisplatin, docetaxel, and 5-fluorouracil chemoagents and potential erbB2 alternatives in oral cancer with growth differentiation factor 15 overexpression.', 'BMX/Etk promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenicity of cervical cancer cells through PI3K/AKT/mTOR and STAT3 pathways.', 'Proton pump inhibitors promote the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells through ErbB2, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3β signaling and inhibition of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase.', 'Functional roles of GDF15 in modulating microenvironment to promote carcinogenesis.', 'Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in cancer cell metastasis: from the cells to the patients.', 'GDF15 Mediates the Effect of Skeletal Muscle Contraction on Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion.', 'ELFN1-AS1 promotes GDF15-mediated immune escape of colorectal cancer from NK cells by facilitating GCN5 and SND1 association.', 'PKNOX2 suppresses lung cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis.', 'GDF15 as a key disease target and biomarker: linking chronic lung diseases and ageing.', 'GDNF family receptor alpha-like antagonist antibody alleviates chemotherapy-induced cachexia in melanoma-bearing mice.']"""

Conversely, the human Dachshund homologue 1 (DACH1) is recognized as a tumor suppressor which retards the progression of various cancers. In prostate cancer, it has been demonstrated that DACH1 was negatively correlated with the expression of CXCL8 and able to antagonize the effects of CXCL8 on cellular migration. Herein, we explored the mechanisms by which DACH1 regulated the CXCL8 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Methods:   Public microarray and Kaplan-Meier plotter datasets were analyzed. Blood serum samples from lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients were collected for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted on tissue microarray. Cell lines with stable expression of DACH1 were established, and relative gene expression was measured by Western blot, ELISA, real-time PCR, and human cytokine array. Correspondingly, cell lines transfected with shDACH1 were established, and relative gene expression was measured by real-time PCR and immunofluorescence array. Functional studies were performed by transwell and xenograft mice models. Luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to measure the regulation of DACH1 on CXCL8.  Results:   Our study indicated that CXCL8 both at the mRNA and protein level was associated with the high tumor burden of ADC. Correlational analyses in ADC cell lines and ADC tissues showed that DACH1 was inversely correlated with CXCL8. Meanwhile, patients with high DACH1 expression and low CXCL8 expression had prolonged time to death and recurrence. Moreover, we verified the inhibitory effects of DACH1 on CXCL8 both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism studies proved that DACH1 transcriptionally repressed CXCL8 promoter activity through activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-κB) sites.  Conclusions:   Our study proved that CXCL8 acted as an unfavorable factor promoting to tumor progression and poor prognosis of ADC, while DACH1 antagonized CXCL8 to provide a favorable survival of ADC patients.

Metformin, an antidiabetes drug, has antiproliferative effects being proposed for cancer treatment. However, under intense proliferative stimulation conditions such as those found in obesity, its efficacy is still uncertain. Thus, we analyzed the effects of saturated fatty acid and/or insulin under high concentrations, with or without metformin, on the proliferation and migration of prostate cells.  Methods:   Human prostate epithelial cell lines non-tumor (PNT1A) and tumor (PC3) were treated with control media (DMEM, C), palmitate (100 µM, HF), and/or insulin (50 µU, HI) with or without metformin (100 µM) for 24 or 48 h.  Results:   Both PNT1A and PC3 cells had greater proliferation when treated with HF, while HI treatment stimulated only PNT1A. Metformin inhibited cell proliferation caused by HF in both cell lines, but it did not block the proliferative action of HI in PNT1A cells. PNT1A increased cell migration after all treatments, while only HF influenced PC3; metformin inhibited the migration stimulated by all obese microenvironments. Both HF and HI treatments in PNT1A and HF treatment in PC3 augmented vimentin expression, resulting in a higher epithelial-mesenchymal transition (which, in turn, could influence cell migration). Metformin inhibited vimentin expression in both normal and tumor cells. Although HF treatment had increased AMPK activation, it also increased the levels of activated ERK1/2, which could be responsible for high cell proliferation in both cell lines. In contrast, HI decreased AMPK activation in both cell lines, whereas it increased ERK1/2 levels in PNT1A and decreased them in PC3 (reflecting greater cell proliferation only in non-tumor cells). Metformin maintained high activation of AMPK and decreased ERK1/2 levels after HF in both cell lines and only after HI in PNT1A, which was able to decrease the cell proliferation triggered by these treatments.  Conclusions:   Higher concentrations of palmitate on PC3 cells and palmitate and insulin on PNT1A cells stimulate cellular activities that could favor cancer progression. Metformin inhibited most of these stimuli, showing the efficacy of this drug for cancer adjuvant therapy in obese patients (a group at increased risk for the development of prostrate cancer).""","""['Breno C Landim', 'Mariana M de Jesus', 'Beatriz P Bosque', 'Renata G Zanon', 'Claudio V da Silva', 'Rejane M Góes', 'Daniele L Ribeiro']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Effect of glucose and palmitate environment on proliferation and migration of PC3-prostate cancer cells.', 'Phorbol ester stimulates ethanolamine release from the metastatic basal prostate cancer cell line PC3 but not from prostate epithelial cell lines LNCaP and P4E6.', 'Combined Treatment with Exendin-4 and Metformin Attenuates Prostate Cancer Growth.', 'A review for clinicians: Prostate cancer and the antineoplastic properties of metformin.', 'Colorectal and Prostate Cancer Risk in Diabetes: Metformin, an Actor behind the Scene.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'Palmitic acid induces inflammation in placental trophoblasts and impairs their migration toward smooth muscle cells through plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.', 'Effect of Palmitic Acid on Exosome-Mediated Secretion and Invasive Motility in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Dietary Fat and Cancer-Which Is Good, Which Is Bad, and the Body of Evidence.', 'Obesity, Inflammation, and Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   We prospectively examined 245 patients without OAB who underwent RARP for localized prostate cancer. Subjective and objective symptoms in the lower urinary tract were evaluated before and after surgery. At 3 months after RARP, the patients were divided into two groups: patients with de novo OAB (de novo OAB group) and those without OAB (OAB-free group). We compared the operative and urodynamic parameters between both groups and evaluated the factors related to OAB.  Results:   De novo OAB was observed in 37.8% (87/230) of patients. Post-operative continence rate was significantly higher in the OAB-free group (79.7%) than in the de novo OAB group (8.0%). Although the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) in the de novo OAB group significantly deteriorated from 9.7 to 14.1 and from 2.4 to 8.3, respectively, no corresponding significant changes occurred in the OAB-free group. Additionally, there was a significant difference in pre-operative IPSS-QOL score, continence rate, pre-and post-operative maximum urethral closing pressure (MUCP), and post-operative functional profile length (FPL) between both groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed pre-operative IPSS-QOL score and post-operative MUCP were significant predictive factors for de novo OAB.

We evaluated the feasibility and oncological outcomes of radical prostatectomy in non-metastatic prostate cancer patients with prostate-specific antigen levels of 50 ng/ml or higher.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 31 patients who were diagnosed as very high-risk prostate cancer (clinical stage of any T, N0-1 M0 and PSA levels ≥50 ng/ml) and underwent radical prostatectomy either as a monotherapy or as a component of multimodal therapy (RP group). Surgery-related complications were investigated. Time to castration-resistant prostate cancer, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 47 patients with very high-risk prostate cancer who were treated with androgen deprivation therapy without local therapy served as a control group (ADT group). Survivals were compared between RP group and ADT group in exploratory analyses.  Results:   The median pretreatment prostate-specific antigen was 87 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml in the RP and ADT groups, respectively (P = 0.67). Surgical complications of Clavien-Dindo Grade 3 were documented in nine patients (29%). Ten-year castration-resistant prostate cancer-free, cancer-specific and overall survivals were 78%, 81% and 77% in RP group, respectively, and they were significantly better than those of ADT group (54%, P = 0.006; 54%, P = 0.006 and 38%, P < 0.001). Exploratory multivariate analysis identified radical prostatectomy as the only significant factor associated with a better cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio: 0.25, P = 0.006).

Methods:   Using data from the Israeli National Central Bureau of Statistics 1995 census (persons aged between 15 and 60 years old), the Israeli Tax Authority database and the Israel Cancer Registry, cancer patients (diagnosed between the years 2000 and 2007 and alive at 2011) were compared with matched cancer-free controls.  Results:   There were 8797 cancer patients and 26166 cancer-free controls. We found that, in general, cancer was not associated with unemployment 2 years before diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90-1.009, P = NS) after adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, educational years and residential socioeconomic position. However, the diagnoses associated with screening (breast, prostate, colorectal and cervix cancers) were inversely associated with unemployment 2 years before diagnosis (adjusted OR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.97, P < 0.01).

Case description:   We report a case of 70-years old man with history of left orchiectomy for undescended testicle, who presented to our department with a palpable nodule in the right scrotum. Scrotal ultrasound revealed an inhomogeneous hypoechoic nodule of epididymis and/or spermatic cord. Neoplastic markers showed high levels of CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and bHCG (beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin). The patient underwent right surgical scrotal exploration with orchifunicolectomy. Pathologic examination revealed pathologic tissue showing rare glandular structures. Immunohistochemistry profile was compatible with malign epithelial neoplasm with glandular differentiation. Total body CT-scan revealed pathologic tissue in pancreas between head and body and a suspect pathologic lesion in liver and 18-FDG PET-scan confirmed the pancreatic neoplastic mass and a suspect secondary hepatic lesion.

The microarray data (GSE33455) to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in DTX-resistant PCa cell lines (DU-145-DTX and PC-3-DTX) was retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. QRT-PCR analysis was performed to measure MALAT1 expression in DTX-sensitive and DTX-resistant tissues/cells. The human DTX-resistant cell lines DU145-PTX and PC3-DTX were established as in vitro cell models, and the expression of MALAT1, miR-145-5p and AKAP12 was manipulated in DTX-sensitive and DTX-resistant cells. Cell viability was examined using MTT assay and colony formation methods. Cell apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining. Cell migration and invasion was determined by scratch test (wound healing) and Transwell assay, respectively. Dual-luciferase assay was applied to analyse the target relationship between lncRNA MALAT1 and miR-145-5p, as well as between miR-145-5p and AKAP12. Tumour xenograft study was undertaken to confirm the correlation of MALAT1/miR-145-5p/AKAP12 axis and DTX sensitivity of PCa cells in vivo. In this study, we firstly notified that the MALAT1 expression levels were up-regulated in clinical DTX-resistant PCa samples. Overexpressed MALAT1 promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion but decreased cell apoptosis rate of PCa cells in spite of DTX treatment. We identified miR-145-5p as a target of MALAT1. MiR-145-5p overexpression in PC3-DTX led to inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as reduced chemoresistance to DTX, which was attenuated by MALAT1. Moreover, we determined that AKAP12 was a target of miR-145-5p, which significantly induced chemoresistance of PCa cells to DTX. Besides, it was proved that MALAT1 promoted tumour cell proliferation and enhanced DTX-chemoresistance in vivo. There was an lncRNA MALAT1/miR-145-5p/AKAP12 axis involved in DTX resistance of PCa cells and provided a new thought for PCa therapy.""","""['Dong Xue', 'Hao Lu', 'Han-Yan Xu', 'Cui-Xing Zhou', 'Xiao-Zhou He']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Retraction.', 'LncRNA LOXL1-AS1/miR-let-7a-5p/EGFR-related pathway regulates the doxorubicin resistance of prostate cancer DU-145 cells.', 'Exosomal circRNA Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 2 (circ-SFMBT2) enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer via the microRNA-136-5p/tribbles homolog 1 pathway.', 'MiR-129-5p promotes docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by down-regulating CAMK2N1 expression.', 'LncRNA MALAT1 promotes osteoarthritis by modulating miR-150-5p/AKT3 axis.', 'Molecular Mechanism of the Canonical Oncogenic lncRNA MALAT1 in Gastric Cancer.', 'Genomic and Phenotypic Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Guidance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Functions and mechanisms of lncRNA MALAT1 in cancer chemotherapy resistance.', 'A miRNA-Based Prognostic Model to Trace Thyroid Cancer Recurrence.', 'Effects of hsa-mir-145-5p on the Regulation of msln Expression in Colorectal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Sesquiterpene Lactones Attenuate Paclitaxel Resistance Via Inhibiting MALAT1/STAT3/ FUT4 Axis and P-Glycoprotein Transporters in Lung Cancer Cells.']"""

The task of model creation, however, can result in estimates with differing accuracy; particularly when outlier plans are not properly addressed. This work used RapidPlan™ to create models for the prostate and head and neck intended for large-scale distribution. Potential outlier plans were identified by means of regression analysis scatter plots, Cook's distance, coefficient of determination, and the chi-squared test. Outlier plans were identified as falling into three categories: geometric, dosimetric, and over-fitting outliers. The models were validated by comparing DVHs estimated by the model with those from a separate and independent set of clinical plans. The estimated DVHs were also used as optimization objectives during inverse planning. The analysis tools lead us to identify as many as 7 geometric, 8 dosimetric, and 20 over-fitting outliers in the raw models. Geometric and over-fitting outliers were removed while the dosimetric outliers were replaced after re-planning. Model validation was done by comparing the DVHs at 50%, 85%, and 99% of the maximum dose for each OAR (denoted as V50, V85, and V99) and agreed within -2% to 4% for the three metrics for the final prostate model. In terms of the head and neck model, the estimated DVHs agreed from -2.0% to 5.1% at V50, 0.1% to 7.1% at V85, and 0.1% to 7.6% at V99. The process used to create these models improved the accuracy for the pharyngeal constrictor DVH estimation where one plan was originally over-estimated by more than twice. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that KBP models should be carefully created since their accuracy could be negatively affected by outlier plans. Outlier plans can be addressed by removing them from the model and re-planning.""","""['Jorge Edmundo Alpuche Aviles', 'Maria Isabel Cordero Marcos', 'David Sasaki', 'Keith Sutherland', 'Bill Kane', 'Esa Kuusela']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Quantitative analysis of the factors which affect the interpatient organ-at-risk dose sparing variation in IMRT plans.', 'Evaluation of a knowledge-based planning solution for head and neck cancer.', 'A method for a priori estimation of best feasible DVH for organs-at-risk: Validation for head and neck VMAT planning.', 'Knowledge-Based Planning for Intact Cervical Cancer.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.', 'Standardization of knowledge-based volumetric modulated arc therapy planning with a multi-institution model (broad model) to improve prostate cancer treatment quality.', 'Evaluating machine learning enhanced intelligent-optimization-engine (IOE) performance for ethos head-and-neck (HN) plan generation.', 'The effect of integrating knowledge-based planning with multicriteria optimization in treatment planning for prostate SBRT.', 'Performance of a knowledge-based planning model for optimizing intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans for partial breast irradiation.', 'Replacing Manual Planning of Whole Breast Irradiation With Knowledge-Based Automatic Optimization by Virtual Tangential-Fields Arc Therapy.']"""

Methods:   Patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were divided into two groups according to prostate-specific antigen testing opportunity (group 1, prostate-specific antigen screening; group 2, non-prostate-specific antigen screening). Perioperative clinical characteristics were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum and χ2 -tests. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independent predictors of postoperative biochemical recurrence-free survival.  Results:   In total, 798 patients (63.2%) and 464 patients (36.8%) were categorized into groups 1 and 2, respectively. Group 2 patients were more likely to have a higher prostate-specific antigen level and age at diagnosis and larger prostate volume.

However, limitations are a low PSMA expression in certain patients. Androgen receptor axis inhibition can induce PSMA expression in vitro. We hypothesized that different approved compounds upregulate PSMA expression and tested their effect in vitro.  Methods:   Androgen receptor (AR) expressing prostate cancer (LNCaP) and epithelial prostate cells (PNT1A) were treated for 7 days with enzalutamide, dutasteride, rapamycin, metformin, lovastatin, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). PSMA and AR protein expression was assessed using flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. Furthermore, uptake and internalization of 177 Lu-PSMA-617 was performed.  Results:   Enzalutamide and dutasteride led to a significant (both P < 0.05) upregulation of PSMA surface levels in LNCaP cells. In addition, treatment with rapamycin showed a non-significant trend toward PSMA upregulation. No changes were detected after treatment with vehicle, metformin, lovastatin, and ASA. Total PSMA protein expression was significantly enhanced after treatment with enzalutamide and rapamycin (both P < 0.05), whereas dutasteride led to a non-significant upregulation. Uptake of 177 Lu-PSMA-617 was significantly increased after treatment of LNCaP with enzalutamide, dutasteride, and rapamycin (P < 0.05). In addition, internalization was significantly increased by enzalutamide and rapamycin (P < 0.05), and non-significantly increased by dutasteride.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, our data provide new insights into the effect of different approved pharmacological compounds that can markedly upregulate PSMA expression and radioligand uptake in vitro.

Methods:   The levels of miR-4319 in PC tissues were determined by RT-qPCR and their association with patient survival was studied by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Targeted genes for miR-4319 were predicted by a bioinformatics algorithm and confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Growth of cells of overexpression or inhibition of miR-4319 or Her-2 was analyzed by an MTT assay. Cell survival in response to a chemotherapeutic drug, estramustine (EM), was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL assay and Western blotting for apoptosis-associated proteins.  Results:   MiR-4319 levels were decreased in PC specimens, compared to corresponding normal prostate tissue. Lower levels of miR-4319 were correlated with poorer overall patients' survival. In vitro, the cell survival mediated with Her-2 against chemotherapy was inhibited by overexpression of miR-4319 and was enhanced by depletion of miR-4319. Depletion of miR-4319 in primary prostate epithelial cells increased Her-2-dependent cell growth, while re-expression of miR-4319 in PC cells inhibited Her-2-dependent cell growth and Her-2-dependent resistance to EM-induced apoptosis.

PSM rates were compared between two time periods, 1998-2002 and 2008-2012. PSM was positively correlated with tumor category and grade. Ovarian and prostate cancers had the highest PSM prevalence in women and men, respectively. The highest PSM rates for cancers affecting both genders were seen for oral cavity tumors. PSM rates for breast cancer and lung and bronchus cancer in both men and women declined over the study period. PSM increases were seen for bladder, colon and rectum, and kidney and renal pelvis cancers. This large-scale analysis appraises the magnitude of PSM in the United States in order to focus future efforts on improving oncologic surgical care with the goal of optimizing value and improving patient outcomes.""","""['Ryan K Orosco', 'Viridiana J Tapia', 'Joseph A Califano', 'Bryan Clary', 'Ezra E W Cohen', 'Christopher Kane', 'Scott M Lippman', 'Karen Messer', 'Alfredo Molinolo', 'James D Murphy', 'John Pang', 'Assuntina Sacco', 'Kathryn R Tringale', 'Anne Wallace', 'Quyen T Nguyen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Positive margin length and highest Gleason grade of tumor at the margin predict for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in patients with organ-confined prostate cancer.', 'Rates of Positive Surgical Margins and Their Effect on Cancer-specific Mortality at Radical Prostatectomy for Patients With Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Positive surgical margins are predictors of local recurrence in conservative kidney surgery for pT1 tumors.', 'Systematic Review of Studies Reporting Positive Surgical Margins After Bladder Neck Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Radical prostatectomy: positive surgical margins matter.', 'The impact of boost radiation therapy after hysterectomy on cervical cancer patients with close or positive resection margins.', 'Paired-agent imaging as a rapid en face margin screening method in Mohs micrographic surgery.', 'Protease Activated Probes for Real-Time Ratiometric Imaging of Solid Tumors.', 'Image-guided cancer surgery: a narrative review on imaging modalities and emerging nanotechnology strategies.', 'Intraoperative molecular imaging: 3rd biennial clinical trials update.']"""

However, there remains a need for MSI diagnostics that are low cost, highly accurate, and generalizable across cancer types. We developed a method for targeted high-throughput sequencing of numerous microsatellite loci with pan-cancer informativity for MSI using single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs).  Methods:   We designed a smMIP panel targeting 111 loci highly informative for MSI across cancers. We developed an analytical framework taking advantage of smMIP-mediated error correction to specifically and sensitively detect instability events without the need for typing matched normal material.  Results:   Using synthetic DNA mixtures, smMIPs were sensitive to at least 1% MSI-positive cells and were highly consistent across replicates. The fraction of identified unstable microsatellites discriminated tumors exhibiting MSI from those lacking MSI with high accuracy across colorectal (100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity), prostate (100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity), and endometrial cancers (95.8% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity). MSI-PCR, the current standard-of-care molecular diagnostic for MSI, proved equally robust for colorectal tumors but evidenced multiple false-negative results in prostate (81.8% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity) and endometrial (75.0% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% specificity) tumors.  Conclusions:   smMIP capture provides an accurate, diagnostically sensitive, and economical means to diagnose MSI across cancer types without reliance on patient-matched normal material. The assay is readily scalable to large numbers of clinical samples, enables automated and quantitative analysis of microsatellite instability, and is readily standardized across clinical laboratories.""","""['Adam Waalkes', 'Nahum Smith', 'Kelsi Penewit', 'Jennifer Hempelmann', 'Eric Q Konnick', 'Ronald J Hause', 'Colin C Pritchard', 'Stephen J Salipante']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Chem""","""['Comprehensive routine diagnostic screening to identify predictive mutations, gene amplifications, and microsatellite instability in FFPE tumor material.', 'Microsatellite instability detection by next generation sequencing.', 'Identifying Optimal Loci for the Molecular Diagnosis of Microsatellite Instability.', 'Microsatellite Instability: From the Implementation of the Detection to a Prognostic and Predictive Role in Cancers.', 'A systematic review of test accuracy studies evaluating molecular micro-satellite instability testing for the detection of individuals with lynch syndrome.', 'Chimeras in Merlot grapevine revealed by phased assembly.', 'Discrepancy among microsatellite instability detection methodologies in non-colorectal cancer: Report of 3 cases.', 'LT-RPA: An Isothermal DNA Amplification Approach for Improved Microsatellite Genotyping and Microsatellite Instability Detection.', 'Microsatellite instability assessment is instrumental for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine: status quo and outlook.', 'Prediction of immunotherapy efficacy and immunomodulatory role of hypoxia in colorectal cancer.']"""

Cost-of-care estimates are key inputs for comparative effectiveness and economic analyses that aim to inform policies associated with cancer care. Existing estimates are based largely on SEER-Medicare data in the elderly, leaving a knowledge gap regarding costs for patients aged <65 years. Methods: We estimated total and net medical care costs using data on individuals diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer (n=45,522) and noncancer controls (n=314,887) enrolled in 1 of 4 participating health plans. Net costs were defined as the difference in mean total costs between patients with cancer and controls. The phase-of-care approach and Kaplan-Meier Sample Average method were used to estimate mean total and net 1- and 5-year costs (in 2015 US dollars) by cancer site, stage at diagnosis, and age group (<65 and ≥65 years). Results: Total and net costs were consistently highest for lung cancer and lowest for prostate cancer. Net costs were higher across all cancer sites for patients aged <65 years than those aged ≥65 years. Medical care costs for all cancers increased with advanced stage at diagnosis. Conclusions: This study improves understanding of medical care costs for the 4 most common invasive cancers in the United States. Higher costs among patients aged <65 years highlight limitations of relying on SEER-Medicare data alone to understand the national burden of cancer, whereas higher costs for patients with advanced-stage cancer underscore the importance of early detection to curtail high long-term costs. These cost estimates can be used in the development and evaluation of interventions and policies across the cancer care continuum.""","""['Matthew P Banegas', 'K Robin Yabroff', ""Maureen C O'Keeffe-Rosetti"", 'Debra P Ritzwoller', 'Paul A Fishman', 'Ramzi G Salloum', 'Jennifer Elston Lafata', 'Mark C Hornbrook']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['Cost of care for elderly cancer patients in the United States.', 'Comparison of approaches for estimating incidence costs of care for colorectal cancer patients.', 'Obtaining long-term disease specific costs of care: application to Medicare enrollees diagnosed with colorectal cancer.', 'Costs of cancer along the care continuum: What we can expect based on recent literature.', 'Measuring costs: administrative claims data, clinical trials, and beyond.', 'Cancer cost profiles: The Epicost estimation approach.', 'Economic burden of brain metastases in non-small cell lung cancer patients in South Korea: A retrospective cohort study using nationwide claims data.', 'Increased healthcare costs by later stage cancer diagnosis.', 'Shared burden: the association between cancer diagnosis, financial toxicity, and healthcare cost-related coping mechanisms by family members of non-elderly patients in the USA.', 'Nursing Research on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Based on Continuous Nursing Care.']"""

However, identification of clinically-relevant responses and predictive biomarkers is essential to maximize efficacy and treatment personalization. Here, we combined mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analyses with a unique patient-derived explant (PDE) model that retains the complex microenvironment of primary prostate tumors. Independent discovery and validation cohorts of PDEs (n = 16 and 30, respectively) were cultured in the absence or presence of Hsp90 inhibitors AUY922 or 17-AAG. PDEs were analyzed by LC-MS/MS with a hyper-reaction monitoring data independent acquisition (HRM-DIA) workflow, and differentially expressed proteins identified using repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA; raw p value <0.01). Using gene set enrichment, we found striking conservation of the most significantly AUY922-altered gene pathways between the discovery and validation cohorts, indicating that our experimental and analysis workflows were robust. Eight proteins were selectively altered across both cohorts by the most potent inhibitor, AUY922, including TIMP1, SERPINA3 and CYP51A (adjusted p < 0.01). The AUY922-mediated decrease in secretory TIMP1 was validated by ELISA of the PDE culture medium. We next exploited the heterogeneous response of PDEs to 17-AAG in order to detect predictive biomarkers of response and identified PCBP3 as a marker with increased expression in PDEs that had no response or increased in proliferation. Also, 17-AAG treatment led to increased expression of DNAJA1 in PDEs that exhibited a cytostatic response, revealing potential drug resistance mechanisms. This selective regulation of DNAJA1 was validated by Western blot analysis.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of radiotherapy on cancer specific mortality in surgically treated patients according to tumor size, histological subtype and grade.  Material and methods:   Within Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2014), we identified 1226 patients with non-metastatic retroperitoneal sarcoma. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models tested for predictors of radiotherapy delivery. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models tested the effect of radiotherapy on cancer specific mortality in the overall population. Subgroup analyses explored the result of tumor grade and tumor size on radiotherapy effect. All analyses were repeated after adjustment according to inverse probability of treatment. Additionally, all analyses were subjected to 1000 bootstrap resamples for internal validation.  Results:   Radiotherapy was delivered in 372 patients (30.3%). In univariable and multivariable logistic regression models high grade (OR: 1.46, CI:1.12-1.90; p = 0.006), and leiomyosarcoma histologic subtype (OR: 2.14, CI: 1.55-2.95; p < 0.001) predicted radiotherapy delivery. In the overall population multivariable Cox regression models showed lower cancer specific mortality (HR: 0.73, CI: 0.55-0.96; p = 0.025) with radiotherapy. In subgroup analyses multivariable Cox regression models showed radiotherapy benefit predominantly in high grade, large tumor size retroperitoneal sarcomas (HR 0.51: C.I.: 0.30-0.86; p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   In this retrospective report, delivery of radiotherapy was associated with lower cancer specific mortality in high grade, large tumor size retroperitoneal sarcoma patients.

Material and methods:   A descriptive retrospective study of RP was conducted at our centre from 1986 to 2017 on HRPC whose primary objective was to determine overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). The study's secondary objectives were to determine biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), rescue therapy-free survival (RTFS), hormone therapy-free survival (HTFS) and the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. We performed a Cox regression analysis to establish predictive models and to better understand the weight of each variable that defines high risk.  Results:   A total of 2093 RPs were performed, 480 (22.9%) of which were for HRPC. The median follow-up for the overall series was 79.57 months (P25-75 37.92-135.16). Lymphadenectomy was not performed in 6.5% of the cases. The lymphadenectomy was of the obturator type in 51.2% of the cases and extended in 42.3%. Overall survival at 5, 10 and 15 years was 89.8% (95% CI 86.7-92.9%), 73.3% (95% CI 68-78.6%) and 51.4% (95% CI 43.8-59%), respectively. CSS at 5, 10 and 15 years was 94.8% (95% CI 92.4-97.2%), 84.0% (95% CI 79.3-88.7%) and 75.5% (95% CI 68.8-82.2%), respectively. MFS at 5, 10 and 15 years was 87.4% (95% CI 84.1-90.7%), 72.2% (95% CI 66.7-77.7%) and 61.7% (95% CI 54.3-69.1%), respectively. A total of 120 patients of 477 analysed (25.1%) required rescue radiation therapy, and 293/477 never required hormone therapy (61.4%). Of the 93 pN1 patients, 33 (35.5%) did not require hormone therapy. The time from RP to biochemical progression was the variable with the greatest prognostic weight for MFS, CSS and overall survival.  Conclusions:   RP plus extended lymphadenectomy should be the first therapeutic manoeuvre when feasible within a multimodal strategy.

In the framework of lymphoscintigraphic imaging performed to evaluate secondary LLL, some lympho-nodal presentations have been observed that could not be explained by the applied treatments, suggesting that these LLL might be primary. Therefore, all our lymphoscintigraphic examinations that were performed in patients for LLL after surgery for gynecological or urological cancer were retrospectively analyzed in order to evaluate the frequency in which these LLL might not be secondary (either completely or partially) but primary in origin.  Methods:   Lymphoscintigraphies performed in 33 patients who underwent LN dissection (limited to the intra-abdominal LN) with or without radiotherapy for histologically confirmed ovarian cancer (n = 6), uterine cancer (n = 14 with cervical cancer and n = 7 with endometrial cancer), or prostate cancer (n = 6) were compared to lymphoscintigraphies obtained in primary LLL.  Results:   In 12 (33% of the) patients (3 men plus 9 women, 4 with cervical cancer and 5 with endometrial cancer), scintigraphy of the lower limbs revealed lympho-nodal presentation that did not match with the expected consequences of the surgical and/or radiological treatments and were either suggestive or typical of primary lymphedema.

A binary decision tree was fit using a conditional inference tree method to predict operative times. The variables most associated with operative time were determined using permutation tests. Data were split at the value of the variable that results in the largest difference in mean for surgical time across the split. This process was repeated recursively on the resultant data.  Results:   A total of 1709 RARPs were included. The variable most strongly associated with operative time was the surgeon (surgeons 2 and 4-102 minutes shorter than surgeons 1, 3, 5, and 6, p < 0.001). Among surgeons 2 and 4, BMI had the strongest association with surgical time (p < 0.001).

Etiology of MS is undiscovered but it is assumed that both genetic and environmental triggers play an important role in disease pathogenesis. Mitoxantrone (MTX) is an antracycline antibiotic that is used in oncologic treatment of breast, prostate, liver, ovarian and stomach cancer. MTX is also effective in treatment of primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and in relapsing - remitting subtype of disease with no reaction for other drugs therapy. In treatment of MS drug is given intravenously in a dose of 12 mg/m2 in three months intervals to maximal dose of 120-140 mg/m² of body surface. MTX treatment can cause transient reduction of leukocyte, erythrocyte and thrombocyte number in blood but the most dangerous side effect of MTX treatment is therapy related acute leukemia (TRAL). The aim of this study was to evaluate influence of MTX treatment on complete blood count in multiple sclerosis patients. Seventy two patients with multiple sclerosis treated with mitoxantrone from 2002 to 2014 took part in this study. Control group comprised 60 patients with multiple sclerosis who weren't given immunomodulatory treatment. In this study, amount of leukocytes, erythrocytes and thrombocytes after MTX treatment was compared to those before treatment and in control group. Six patients were withdrawn from the study because of leucopenia. A decrease of leukocytes, erythrocytes and thrombocytes number after MTX treatment was observed in comparison to control group and value before treatment. The decrease of erythrocytes number after MTX treatment was statistically significant. The most frequent side effect of mitoxantrone treatment is transient, asymptomatic leucopenia.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been thought to increase the risk of cancer by inhibiting calcium signal-mediated apoptosis, but the evidence for this association remains inconclusive. We have reviewed pertinent literature and pooled data to establish a consensus on the relationship of CCB use and the incidence of these two cancers.  Methods:   PubMed was used to conduct a search for English articles from inception to April 2016. Relevant data including study design, number of total participants and CCB users, total cases of BCa and PCa, age (mean and/or range), follow-up period and statistical outcomes were retrieved. Quality assessment was carried out using Newcastle Ottawa system, with the selection of high-quality studies. Summary effects were obtained using random- and mixed-effects models, followed by sensitivity analysis, and testing for publication bias.  Results and discussion:   This meta-analysis includes 11 relevant studies for BCa and 6 for PCa. The odds ratio (OR) association between BCa and CCB use was 1.14 (95%CI: 1.02, 1.27, P = .02). The OR association between PCa and CCB use was 1.12 (95%CI .94-1.35, P = .21).  What is new and conclusion:   Although a statistically significant association between CCB use and incidence of BCa does exist, the limitations of the individual studies restrict the clinical application of this relationship. Our meta-regression model does newly identify a 9-year latency period of CCB use and a significantly increased risk of BCa. No significant association exists between CCB use and the incidence of PCa. Our meta-regression shows CCB may have a protective effect upon PCa incidence among older populations.""","""['A A Thakur', 'X Wang', 'M M Garcia-Betancourt', 'R A Forse']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Pharm Ther""","""['Association Between the Overall Risk of Prostate Cancer and Use of Calcium Channel Blockers: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'The Risk for Prostate Cancer With Calcium Channel Blockers: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Meta-Regression.', 'Association between calcium channel blockers and breast cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies.', 'The Risk for Lung Cancer Incidence with Calcium Channel Blockers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.', 'Calcium channel blockers and breast cancer incidence: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence.', 'Blood pressure, calcium channel blockers, and the risk of prostate cancer: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'CACNA1D overexpression and voltage-gated calcium channels in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'Cardiovascular Disease as a Consequence or a Cause of Cancer: Potential Role of Extracellular Vesicles.', 'Calcium Channel Blocker Use and the Risk for Breast Cancer: A Population-Based Nested Case-Control Study.', 'Cardio-Oncology: A Myriad of Relationships Between Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer.']"""

Cellular senescence, characterized by stable and long term loss of proliferative capacity, acts as a potent tumor suppressive mechanism. Here, we provide evidence for the first time that TQ suppresses growth of glioma cells by potentially inducing the expression of prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) tumor suppressor protein. In turn, TQ-induced Par-4 expression triggers cellular senescence, as evidenced by increasing cellular size, β-galactosidase staining, G1 phase arrest, and increased expression of senescence markers such as p53, p21, Rb, and decreased expression of lamin B1, cyclin E and cyclin depended kinase-2 (CDK-2). Further, overexpression of Par-4 significantly increases the expression of p53 and its downstream target p21, and increases β-galactosidase positive cells, while siRNA/shRNA mediated-knockdown of Par-4 reverses the TQ-induced effects.

As clinical features are currently used to select men for active surveillance (AS), we developed and validated a CCR score threshold to improve the identification of men with low-risk disease who are appropriate for AS.  Methods:   The score threshold was selected based on the 90th percentile of CCR scores among men who might typically be considered for AS based on NCCN low/favorable-intermediate risk criteria (CCR = 0.8). The threshold was validated using 10-year PCM in an unselected, conservatively managed cohort and in the subset of the same cohort after excluding men with high-risk features. The clinical effect was evaluated in a contemporary clinical cohort.  Results:   In the unselected validation cohort, men with CCR scores below the threshold had a predicted mean 10-year PCM of 2.7%, and the threshold significantly dichotomized low- and high-risk disease (P = 1.2 × 10-5). After excluding high-risk men from the validation cohort, men with CCR scores below the threshold had a predicted mean 10-year PCM of 2.3%, and the threshold significantly dichotomized low- and high-risk disease (P = 0.020). There were no prostate cancer-specific deaths in men with CCR scores below the threshold in either analysis. The proportion of men in the clinical testing cohort identified as candidates for AS was substantially higher using the threshold (68.8%) compared to clinicopathologic features alone (42.6%), while mean 10-year predicted PCM risks remained essentially identical (1.9% vs. 2.0%, respectively).

NOTA-GUL and DOTA-GUL were synthesized and labeled with 68Ga using generator-eluted 68GaCl3 in 0.1 M HCl in the presence of 1 M NaOAc at pH 5.5. The stabilities of 68Ga-labeled compounds in human serum were tested at 37.5 °C. A competitive binding assay was performed using the PSMA-positive prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1 and [125I]MIP-1072 (PSMA-specific binding agent) as a tracer. Biodistribution and micro-PET studies were performed using 22Rv1-xenograft BALB/c nude mice. The radiolabeling efficiency of NOTA-GUL (>99%) was higher than that of DOTA-GUL (92%). The IC50 of Ga-NOTA-GUL was 18.3 nM. In the biodistribution study, tumor uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-GUL (5.40% ID/g) was higher than that of 68Ga-DOTA-GUL (4.66% ID/g) at 1 h.

The groove for Hsp90 binding on the TPR domain includes residues Lys227 and Lys308, referred to as the carboxylate clamp, and is essential for Cyp40-Hsp90 binding. In this study, the effect of two mutations, K227A and K308A, and their combinative mutant was investigated by performing a total of 5.76 μs of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent. All simulations, except the K308A mutant, were found to adopt two distinct (extended or compact) conformers defined by different cyclophilin-TPR interdomain distances. The K308A mutant was only observed in the extended form which is observed in the Cyp40 X-ray structure. The wild-type, K227A, and combined mutant also showed bimodal distributions. The experimental melting temperature, Tm, values of the mutants correlate with the degree of compactness with the K308A extended mutant having a marginally lower melting temperature. Another novel measure of compactness determined from the MD data, the ""coordination shell volume,"" also shows a direct correlation with Tm.

Genetic Evaluation of Men (GEM) is a prospective multigene testing study for inherited PCA. Men undergoing GC were surveyed on knowledge of cancer risk and genetics (CRG) and understanding of personal GT results to identify GC needs.  Methods:   GEM participants with or high-risk for PCA were recruited. Pre-test GC was in-person, with video and handout, or via telehealth. Post-test disclosure was in-person, by phone, or via telehealth. Clinical and family history data were obtained from participant surveys and medical records. Participants completed measures of knowledge of CRG, literacy, and numeracy pre-test and post-test. Understanding of personal genetic results was assessed post-test. Factors associated with knowledge of CRG and understanding of personal genetic results were examined using multivariable linear regression or McNemar's test.  Results:   Among 109 men who completed pre- and post-GT surveys, multivariable analysis revealed family history meeting hereditary cancer syndrome (HCS) criteria was significantly predictive of higher baseline knowledge (P = 0.040). Of 101 men who responded definitively regarding understanding of results, 13 incorrectly reported their result (McNemar's P < 0.001).

Estrogen and estrogen metabolites were found to be involved in prostate cancer. Fingolimod (FTY720) is a sphingokinase-1 (SphK1) inhibitor with anticancer properties against various tumor cell types. Herein, we investigated the interference of FTY720 with the cross talk between sphingolipid metabolism and estrogen metabolism within prostate cancer cells. FTY720 showed cytotoxic antiproliferative effects against androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells with IC50 ranging from 3.0 ± 0.3 to 6.8 ± 1.7 μM. Exposure of prostate cancer cells to FTY720 resulted in a dramatic decrease in the concentration of estradiol, estrone, 4-hydroxyestradiol and 16α-hydroxyestrone compared to control cells. However, FTY720 significantly increased the concentration of 2-methoxyestrone and 2-methoxyestradiol within prostate cancer cells. This was mirrored by significant downregulating of the expression of estrogen and catechol estrogen-synthesizing enzymes (CYP19, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1) within prostate cancer cells. On the other hand, FTY720 significantly upregulated the expression of catechol estrogen-detoxifying enzyme (COMT). Additionally, FTY720 abolished estrogen-stimulated expression of ERα and basal expression of ERβ within prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, FTY720 suppressed the expression of the ER-downstream regulated genes, CXCR4 and cyclin D1. Reciprocally, it was found that estradiol and catechol estrogens significantly induced the expression of SphK1 while methoxylated catechol estrogen suppressed its expression within prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner.

Masculinity, body image, and quality of life scores were compared between men obtaining recommended levels of exercise (aerobic or resistance) and those not obtaining recommended level of exercise. Secondary outcomes included the association between masculinity, body image, and quality of life scores as they relate to exercise levels.  Results:   There were significantly higher scores of masculinity (p < 0.01), physical well-being (p < 0.05), prostate cancer specific well-being (p < 0.05), and overall quality of life (p < 0.05) in those obtaining at least 150 min of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise. In the 48% of men who had never received androgen deprivation therapy, significantly higher levels of masculinity, body image, and quality of life were observed in those meeting aerobic guidelines.  Conclusions:   Whether treatment includes androgen deprivation or not, men who participate in higher levels of aerobic exercises report higher levels of masculinity, improved body image, and quality of life than those who are inactive. Future longitudinal research is required evaluating exercise level and its effect on masculinity and body image.""","""['David Michael Langelier', 'Prue Cormie', 'William Bridel', 'Christopher Grant', 'Natalia Albinati', 'Jena Shank', 'Julia Teresa Daun', 'Tak S Fung', 'Colin Davey', 'S Nicole Culos-Reed']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['The impact of hegemonic masculine ideals on self-esteem in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to ADT-naïve patients.', 'Exercise interventions and their effect on masculinity, body image, and personal identity in prostate cancer-A systematic qualitative review.', 'A systematic review of tools used to assess body image, masculinity and self-esteem in men with prostate cancer.', 'Body image, self-esteem, and sense of masculinity in patients with prostate cancer: a qualitative meta-synthesis.', 'Implications of treatment on body image and quality of life.', 'The intersection of biological sex and gender in adverse events following seasonal influenza vaccination in older adults.', 'The impact of hegemonic masculine ideals on self-esteem in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to ADT-naïve patients.', 'The Operationalisation of Sex and Gender in Quantitative Health-Related Research: A Scoping Review.', 'Social Support Mediates the Relationship between Body Image Distress and Depressive Symptoms in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'The Psychosocial Consequences of Prostate Cancer Treatments on Body Image, Sexuality, and Relationships.']"""

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT detects PCa metastasis with superior accuracy, having a potential impact on the planning of definitive radiation therapy (RT) for nonmetastatic PCa. Our objectives were to determine how often definitive RT planning based on standard target volumes covers 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-defined disease and to assess the potential impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on definitive RT planning. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of an intention-to-treat population of 73 patients with localized PCa without prior local therapy who underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for initial staging as part of an investigational new drug trial. Eleven of the 73 were intermediate-risk (15%), 33 were high-risk (45%), 22 were very-high-risk (30%), and 7 were N1 (9.5%). Clinical target volumes (CTVs), which included the prostate, seminal vesicles, and (in accord with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group consensus guidelines) pelvic lymph nodes (LNs), were contoured on the CT portion of the PET/CT images by a radiation oncologist masked to the PET findings. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images were analyzed by a nuclear medicine physician. 68Ga-PSMA-11-positive lesions not covered by planning volumes based on the CTVs were considered to have a major potential impact on treatment planning. Results: All patients had one or more 68Ga-PSMA-11-positive primary prostate lesions. Twenty-five (34%) and 7 (9.5%) of the 73 patients had 68Ga-PSMA-11-positive pelvic LN and distant metastases, respectively. The sites of LN metastases in decreasing order of frequency were external iliac (20.5%), common iliac (13.5%), internal iliac (12.5%) obturator (12.5%), perirectal (4%), abdominal (4%), upper diaphragm (4%), and presacral (1.5%). The median size of the LN lesions was 6 mm (range, 4-24 mm). RT planning based on the CTVs covered 69 (94.5%) of the 73 primary lesions and 20 (80%) of the 25 pelvic LN lesions, on a per-patient analysis. Conclusion:68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT had a major impact on intended definitive RT planning for PCa in 12 (16.5%) of the 73 patients whose RT fields covered the prostate, seminal vesicles, and pelvic LNs and in 25 (37%) of the 66 patients whose RT fields covered the prostate and seminal vesicles but not the pelvic LNs.""","""['Jeremie Calais', 'Amar U Kishan', 'Minsong Cao', 'Wolfgang P Fendler', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Ken Herrmann', 'Francesco Ceci', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Matthew B Rettig', 'John V Hegde', 'Narek Shaverdian', 'Chris R King', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Johannes Czernin', 'Nicholas G Nickols']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Mapping of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy in 270 Patients with a PSA Level of Less Than 1.0 ng/mL: Impact on Salvage Radiotherapy Planning.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'How accurate is 68Gallium-prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography / computed tomography (68Ga-PSMA PET/CT) on primary lymph node staging before radical prostatectomy in intermediate and high risk prostate cancer?

Results of a Contemporary Prospective Observational Study of 3556 Patients""","""There remains a lack of consensus among guideline relating to which patients require investigation for haematuria. We determined the incidence of urinary tract cancer in a prospective observational study of 3556 patients referred for investigation of haematuria across 40 hospitals between March 2016 and June 2017 (DETECT 1; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02676180) and the appropriateness of age at presentation in cases with visible (VH) and nonvisible (NVH) haematuria. The overall incidence of urinary tract cancer was 10.0% (bladder cancer 8.0%, renal parenchymal cancer 1.0%, upper tract transitional cell carcinoma 0.7%, and prostate cancer 0.3%). Patients with VH were more likely to have a diagnosis of urinary tract cancer compared with NVH patients (13.8% vs 3.1%). Older patients, male gender, and smoking history were independently associated with urinary tract cancer diagnosis. Of bladder cancers diagnosed following NVH, 59.4% were high-risk cancers, with 31.3% being muscle invasive. The incidence of cancer in VH patients <45 yr of age was 3.5% (n=7) and 1.0% (n=4) in NVH patients <60 yr old. Our results suggest that patients with VH should be investigated regardless of age. Although the risk of urinary tract cancer in NVH patients is low, clinically significant cancers are detected below the age threshold for referral for investigation.  Patient summary:   This study highlights the requirement to investigate all patients with visible blood in the urine and an age threshold of ≥60 yr, as recommended in some guidelines, as the investigation of nonvisible blood in the urine will miss a significant number of urinary tract cancers. Patient preference is important, and evidence that patients are willing to submit to investigation should be considered in reaching a consensus recommendation for the investigation of haematuria. International consensus to guide that patients will benefit from investigation should be developed.""","""['Wei Shen Tan', 'Andrew Feber', 'Rachael Sarpong', 'Pramit Khetrapal', 'Simon Rodney', 'Rumana Jalil', 'Hugh Mostafid', 'Joanne Cresswell', 'James Hicks', 'Abhay Rane', 'Alastair Henderson', 'Dawn Watson', 'Jacob Cherian', 'Norman Williams', 'Chris Brew-Graves', 'John D Kelly;DETECT I trial collaborators']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Who Should be Investigated for Hematuria?

However, the exact functions and molecular mechanism of PlncRNA-1 in the tumorigenesis of glioma has not been studied. In present work, we firstly identified that PlncRNA-1 expression levels were prominently augmented in glioma patient tissues and glioma cell lines compared with adjacent noncancerous tissue and normal cells, respectively. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that glioma patients with high PlncRNA-1 expression had shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) than those with low PlncRNA-1 expression. Furthermore, loss-of-function assay showed that PlncRNA-1 knockdown dramatically reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, and promoted apoptosis of glioma cell lines. In addition, overexpression of PlncRNA-1 promoted cell proliferation, stimulated cell colony formation, and inhibited cell apoptosis in NHA cells. Mechanically, our results showed that PlncRNA-1 significantly promoted activation of the Notch signal pathway through regulation of Notch-1, Jag-1, and Hes-1 expression.

Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) has been established as a scheme to standardize the reporting of mpMRI findings. Although lesion delineation and PI-RADS ratings could be performed manually, human delineation and ratings are subjective and time-consuming. In this article, we developed and validated a self-tuned graph-based model for PI-RADS rating prediction. 34 features were obtained at the pixel level from T2-weighted (T2W), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) images, from which PI-RADS scores were predicted. Two major innovations were involved in this self-tuned graph-based model. First, graph-based approaches are sensitive to the choice of the edge weight. The proposed model tuned the edge weights automatically based on the structure of the data, thereby obviating empirical edge weight selection. Second, the feature weights were tuned automatically to give heavier weights to features important for PI-RADS rating estimation. The proposed framework was evaluated for its lesion localization performance in mpMRI datasets of 12 patients. In the evaluation, the PI-RADS score distribution map generated by the algorithm and from the observers' ratings were binarized by thresholds of 3 and 4. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy obtained in these two threshold settings ranged from 65 to 77%, 86 to 93% and 85 to 88% respectively, which are comparable to results obtained in previous studies in which non-clinical T2 maps were available. The proposed algorithm took 10s to estimate the PI-RADS score distribution in an axial image. The efficiency achievable suggests that this technique can be developed into a prostate MR analysis system suitable for clinical use after a thorough validation involving more patients.""","""['Weifu Chen', 'Mingquan Lin', 'Eli Gibson', 'Matthew Bastian-Jordan', 'Derek W Cool', 'Zahra Kassam', 'Huageng Liang', 'Guocan Feng', 'Aaron D Ward', 'Bernard Chiu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['Prostate lesion delineation from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging based on locality alignment discriminant analysis.', 'Validation of the Dominant Sequence Paradigm and Role of Dynamic Contrast-enhanced Imaging in PI-RADS Version 2.', 'Multiparametric MRI of the prostate: diagnostic performance and interreader agreement of two scoring systems.', 'Prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2): a pictorial review.', 'PI-RADS Version 2: A Pictorial Update.', 'Algorithms applied to spatially registered multi-parametric MRI for prostate tumor volume measurement.']"""

We investigated how the concordance of non-low-risk prostate cancer among brothers is affected by their genetic relation. Methods We identified 4,262 pairs of brothers with prostate cancer in the Prostate Cancer Database Sweden. Their cancers were categorized as low risk (Gleason score ≤ 6; clinical stage T1-2, Nx/N0, Mx/M0; and prostate-specific antigen ≤ 10 ng/mL) or non-low risk. The odds ratio (OR) for concordance of non-low-risk cancer was calculated with logistic regression for the different types of fraternity (monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, full brothers, and half-brothers) Results Among monozygotic twins who both were diagnosed with prostate cancer, the OR for both brothers being in the non-low-risk category was 3.82 (95% CI, 0.99 to 16.72) after adjusting for age and year of diagnosis. Among full brothers, the corresponding adjusted OR was 1.21 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.39). When the analysis was restricted to brothers who both were diagnosed within 4 years, the results were similar. Conclusion Non-low-risk prostate cancer has a heritable pattern suggesting shared genetic factors, with the highest concordance among monozygotic twins. Our results suggest that a man whose brother has been diagnosed with a non-low-risk prostate cancer is at a clinically relevant increased risk of developing an aggressive prostate cancer himself.""","""['Fredrik Jansson', 'Linda Drevin', 'Thomas Frisell', 'Pär Stattin', 'Ola Bratt', 'Olof Akre']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Concordance of tumor differentiation among brothers with prostate cancer.', 'Effects of prostate-specific antigen testing on familial prostate cancer risk estimates.', 'Family History and Probability of Prostate Cancer, Differentiated by Risk Category: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.', 'Studies of genetic factors in prostate cancer in a twin population.', 'Hereditary prostate cancer.', 'DNA repair deficiency as circulating biomarker in prostate cancer.', 'Predictors of clinically significant prostate cancer in biopsy-naïve and prior negative biopsy men with a negative prostate MRI: improving MRI-based screening with a novel risk calculator.', 'The Value of Real-World Data in Understanding Prostate Cancer Risk and Improving Clinical Care: Examples from Swedish Registries.', 'Immunotherapy as a Precision Medicine Tool for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specimen Antigen (PSA) Screening and Shared Decision Making Among Deaf and Hearing Male Patients.']"""

In this study, the influence of poly-L-arginine on doxorubicin cytotoxicity, its cellular uptake and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis on human prostate cancer DU145 cells are assessed.  Methods:   The cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and poly-L-arginine, alone and in combination, in DU145 cells was evaluated at different exposure times using MTT assay. The influence of poly-L-arginine on doxorubicin delivery into cells was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and ultraviolet spectroscopy. DAPI and ethidium bromide- acridine orange stainings, flow cytometry using annexin V/propidium iodide, western blot analysis with anti-p21 antibody and caspase-3 activity were used to examine the influence of poly-L-arginine on doxorubicininduced cell death.  Results:   Poly-L-arginine had no cytotoxicity at low concentrations and short exposure times. Poly-L-arginine increased the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin in DU145 cells in a time-dependent manner. But no significant reduction was found in HFF cell viability. Poly-L-arginine seems to facilitate doxorubicin uptake and increase its intracellular concentration. 24h combined treatment of cells with doxorubicin (0.5 µM) and poly-L-arginine (1 µg ml-1) caused a small increase in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and significantly elevated necrosis in DU145 cells as compared to each agent alone.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that poly-L-arginine at lowest and highest concentrations act as proliferationinducing and antiproliferative agents, respectively.

Methods:   Between January 2004 and November 2014, 564 patients underwent transperineal ultrasonography-guided permanent iodine-125 seed brachytherapy. We retrospectively analyzed low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The clinical variables were evaluated for influence on biochemical recurrence-free survival, progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival and overall survival.  Results:   A total of 484 patients with low-risk (259 patients) or intermediate-risk disease (225 patients) were evaluated. Of these, 188 received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. With a median follow up of 71 months, the 5-year actuarial biochemical recurrence-free survival rates of patients who did and did not receive neoadjuvant hormonal therapy were 92.9% and 93.6%, respectively (P = 0.2843). When patients were stratified by risk group, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy did not improve biochemical recurrence-free survival outcomes in low- (P = 0.8949) or intermediate-risk (P = 0.1989) patients. The duration or type of hormonal therapy was not significant in predicting biochemical recurrence. In a multivariate analysis, Gleason score, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen, clinical T stage, and prostate dosimetry, primary Gleason score and positive core rate were significant predictive factors of biochemical recurrence-free survival, whereas neoadjuvant hormonal therapy was insignificant. Furthermore, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy did not significantly influence progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival or overall survival.  Conclusions:   In patients with low- or intermediate-risk disease treated with permanent prostate brachytherapy, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy does not improve oncological outcomes.

Methods:   Nine radiologists (three each high, intermediate, low experience) from eight institutions participated. A total of 163 patients with 3-T mpMRI from 4/2012 to 6/2015 were included: 110 cancer patients with prostatectomy after mpMRI, 53 patients with no lesions on mpMRI and negative TRUS-guided biopsy. Readers were blinded to all outcomes and detected lesions per PI-RADSv2 on mpMRI. After 5 weeks, readers re-evaluated patients using CAD to detect lesions. Prostatectomy specimens registered to MRI were ground truth with index lesions defined on pathology. Sensitivity, specificity and agreement were calculated per patient, lesion level and zone-peripheral (PZ) and transition (TZ).  Results:   Index lesion sensitivity was 78.2% for mpMRI alone and 86.3% for CAD-assisted mpMRI (p = 0.013). Sensitivity was comparable for TZ lesions (78.7% vs 78.1%; p = 0.929); CAD improved PZ lesion sensitivity (84% vs 94%; p = 0.003).

Methods:   Patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and diuretic use were recruited from outpatient nephrology clinics. Midstream voided urine specimens were collected using the clean-catch method. The bacterial composition was determined by sequencing the hypervariable (V4) region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Extraction negative controls (no urine) were included to assess the contribution of extraneous DNA from possible sources of contamination. Midstream urine microbiome diversity was assessed with the inverse Simpson, Chao and Shannon indices. The diversity measures were further examined by demographic characteristics and by comorbidities.  Results:   The cohort of 41 women and 36 men with detectable bacterial DNA in their urine samples had a mean age of 71.5 years (standard deviation [SD] 7.9) years (range 60-91 years). The majority were white (68.0%) and a substantial minority were African-American (29.3%) The mean eGFR was 27.2 (SD 13.6) ml/min/1.73 m2. Most men (72.2%) were circumcised and 16.6% reported a remote history of prostate cancer. Many midstream voided urine specimens were dominated (> 50% reads) by the genera Corynebacterium (n = 11), Staphylococcus (n = 9), Streptococcus (n = 7), Lactobacillus (n = 7), Gardnerella (n = 7), Prevotella (n = 4), Escherichia_Shigella (n = 3), and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 2); the rest lacked a dominant genus. The samples had high levels of diversity, as measured by the inverse Simpson [7.24 (95% CI 6.76, 7.81)], Chao [558.24 (95% CI 381.70, 879.35)], and Shannon indices [2.60 (95% CI 2.51, 2.69)]. Diversity measures were generally higher in participants with urgency urinary incontinence and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). After controlling for demographics and diabetes status, microbiome diversity was significantly associated with estimated eGFR (P < 0.05).

We aimed to investigate the combined effect of estrogen-related lifestyle factors on postmenopausal breast cancer risk.  Methods:   Data from 27,153 women enrolled in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial were used. We created an estrogen-related lifestyle score (ERLS) by incorporating a previously developed measure of estrogenic diet, alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity. The scores ranged from 0 to 6 with alcohol and BMI accounting for higher weights than the other factors. To evaluate the preventive possibilities of a low estrogen-related lifestyle and to be consistent with other published lifestyle scores, higher scores were set to correspond with potentially lower estrogenic lifestyle. The association between the ERLS and incident breast cancer was examined using Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   Participants with an ERLS of 4 or ≥ 5 had a 23% (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.67-0.89) and 34% (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.56-0.78) lower risk of breast cancer, respectively, compared to those with an ERLS ≤ 2 after multivariable adjustment. Estimates were similar when restricting to invasive cases or estrogen receptor-positive subtypes. No single lifestyle component appeared to drive the association.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that the combined effect of a lifestyle characterized by a low estrogenic diet, low alcohol consumption, low body weight, and high levels of physical activity are associated with a reduction in postmenopausal breast cancer risk, possibly through an influence on estrogen metabolism.""","""['Mark A Guinter', 'Alexander C McLain', 'Anwar T Merchant', 'Dale P Sandler', 'Susan E Steck']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['A dietary pattern based on estrogen metabolism is associated with breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort of postmenopausal women.', 'Estrogen metabolism and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.', 'Alcohol and postmenopausal breast cancer risk defined by estrogen and progesterone receptor status: a prospective cohort study.', ""Overweight, Obesity, and Postmenopausal Invasive Breast Cancer Risk: A Secondary Analysis of the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Clinical Trials."", 'Epidemiologic studies of estrogen metabolism and breast cancer.', 'Lifestyle Quality Indices and Female Breast Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'A combined healthy lifestyle score in relation to glioma: a case-control study.', 'The Effects of Diet and Exercise on Endogenous Estrogens and Subsequent Breast Cancer Risk in Postmenopausal Women.', 'Pro-inflammatory cytokine polymorphisms and interactions with dietary alcohol and estrogen, risk factors for invasive breast cancer using a post genome-wide analysis for gene-gene and gene-lifestyle interaction.', 'Number of Risky Lifestyle Behaviors and Breast Cancer Risk.']"""

The molecular cause of prostate cancer (PC) is still unclear; however, its progression involves alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as well as somatic mutations such as the ones in PIK3CA gene. A high percentage of PC is considered sporadic, which means that the damage to the genes occurs by chance after birth (mainly somatic mutations will drive the cancer event). However, little is known about somatic mutations in PC development.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated prostate biopsies in the main somatic mutations genes (PIK3CA, TP53, EGFR, KIT, KRAS, PTEN, and BRAF) among individuals with PSA values>4ng/ml (n = 125), including affected and unaffected PC subjects.  Results:   Mutations in KIT gene are related to aggressive PC: TNM stages II to III, Gleason score ≥ 7 and D'Amico risk (P = 0.037, 0.040, and 0.017). However, there are no statistical significant results when more than 3 somatic mutations are presented in the same individual. In relation to environmental factors (smoking, diet, alcohol intake, or workplace exposure) there are no significant differences in the effect of environmental exposure and the somatic mutation presence. The most prevalent mutations among patients with PC are c.1621A>C (rs3822214) in KIT, c.38G>C (rs112445441) in KRAS and c.733G>A (rs28934575) in TP53 genes. KRAS, KIT, and TP53 genes are the most prevalent ones in patients with PC.  Conclusions:   Somatic alterations predisposing to chromosomal rearrangements in PC remain largely undefined.

Methods:   Planning data for consecutive PCa patients treated with IMRT (n = 67) and IG-IMRT (n = 35) was retrieved. Using computer simulations of setup errors, we estimated the patient-specific uncertainty in accumulated treatment dose distributions for the prostate and for posterolateral aspects of the gland that are at highest risk for extra-capsular disease. Multivariate Cox regression for PRFS considering Gleason score, T-stage, pre-treatment PSA, number of elevated clinical risk factors (T2c+, GS7+ and PSA10+), nomogram-predicted risk of extra-capsular disease (ECD), and dose metrics was performed.  Results:   For IMRT vs. IG-IMRT, plan dosimetry values were similar, but simulations revealed uncertainty in delivered dose external to the prostate was significantly different, due to positioning uncertainties. A patient-specific interaction term of the risk of ECD and risk of low dose to the ECD (p = 0.005), and the number of elevated clinical risk factors (p = 0.008), correlate with reduced PRFS.

Methods:   One hundred thirty-eight patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) and visible DIL underwent primary external beam RT between 2008 and 2016 with an aimed prescription dose of 76 Gy to the whole prostate. Seventy-five patients (54%) additionally received androgen deprivation therapy. Three volumes were retrospectively generated: DIL using pretreatment MRI and/or PSMA PET/CT, prostatic gland (PG) and the subtraction between PG and DIL (SPG). The minimum dose (Dmin), maximum dose (Dmax) and mean dose (Dmean) in the three respective volumes were calculated. Biochemical recurrence free survival (BRFS) was considered in uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses. An explorative analysis was performed to determine cut-off values for the three dose parameters in the three respective volumes.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 45 months (14–116 months) 15.9% of patients experienced BR. Dmin (cut-off: 70.6 Gy, HR = 0.39, p = 0.036) applied to the DIL had an impact on BRFS in multivariate analysis, in contrast to the Dmin delivered to PG and SPG which had no significant impact (p > 0.05). Dmin was significantly (p < 0.004) lower in patients with BR than in patients without BR. Dmax within DIL-imaging (cut-off: 75.8 Gy, HR = 0.31, p = 0.009) and in both PG und SPG (cut-off: 76 Gy, HR = 0.32, p = 0.009) had a significant impact on the BRFS. 95% of patients with a Dmax ≥76 Gy in SPG had a Dmin ≥70.6 Gy in DIL-imaging. Dmean in all of the three volumes had no significant impact on BRFS (p > 0.05).  Conclusions:   The dose distribution within DILs defined by PSMA PET/CT and/or MRI is an independent risk factor for BR after primary RT in patients with PCa.

We have shown previously that oral administration of sulforaphane (SFN) significantly inhibits the incidence and/or burden of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) mice. The present study used cellular models of prostate cancer and archived plasma/adenocarcinoma tissues and sections from the TRAMP study to demonstrate inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by SFN treatment in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and castration-resistant (22Rv1) human prostate cancer cells with SFN (5 and 10 μM) resulted in downregulation of protein and mRNA levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN), but not ATP citrate lyase. Protein and mRNA levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), which facilitates fatty acid uptake by mitochondria for β-oxidation, were also decreased following SFN treatment in both cell lines. Immunohistochemistry revealed a significant decrease in expression of FASN and ACC1 proteins in prostate adenocarcinoma sections of SFN-treated TRAMP mice when compared with controls. SFN administration to TRAMP mice resulted in a significant decrease in plasma and/or prostate adenocarcinoma levels of total free fatty acids, total phospholipids, acetyl-CoA and ATP. Consistent with these results, number of neutral lipid droplets was lower in the prostate adenocarcinoma sections of SFN-treated TRAMP mice than in control tumors.

To explore its potential attributes against prostate cancer, we treated human LNCaP prostate cancer cells with ISC-4 and examined their apoptosis responses, and interrogated the signaling mechanisms through pharmacological and siRNA knockdown approaches. Our results show that ISC-4 was more potent at inducing apoptosis than its sulfur analog phenylbutyl isothiocyanate (PBITC) without suppressing protein kinase AKT Ser473 phosphorylation. ISC-4 induced apoptosis in concentration- and time-dependent manners, and the apoptosis execution was attenuated by pre-incubation with a pan caspase inhibitor. ISC-4 decreased the abundance of androgen receptor (AR) and its best known target prostate specific antigen (PSA) without decreasing their steady state mRNA. ISC-4 upregulated the abundance of p53 protein and its Ser15 -phosphorylative activation, and that of DNA double strand break marker Ser139 -p-H2A.X coincident with apoptotic exposure. Similar to the rapid induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by isothiocyanates, ISC-4 increased dihydroethidium-detectable signals in LNCaP cells. Pre-incubation with ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine preserved AR and PSA abundance, markedly reduced ISC-4-induced apoptosis and attenuated p53 Ser phosphorylation, p21Cip1, and p-H2A.X. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of p53 did not suppress ROS production, but decreased ISC-4-induced apoptosis. Knocking down p53-targets PUMA and Bax exerted greater protective effect on ISC-4-induced apoptosis than depleting p21Cip1. In summary, ISC-4 inhibited LNCaP cell growth and survival with ROS-mediated suppression of AR axis signaling and induction of p53-PUMA-Bax mitochondrial apoptosis.""","""['Wei Wu', 'Deepkamal Karelia', 'Kartick Pramanik', 'Shantu G Amin', 'Arun K Sharma', 'Cheng Jiang', 'Junxuan Lu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Differential involvement of reactive oxygen species in apoptosis induced by two classes of selenium compounds in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Activation of p53 signaling and inhibition of androgen receptor mediate tanshinone IIA induced G1 arrest in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Role of P53-Senescence Induction in Suppression of LNCaP Prostate Cancer Growth by Cardiotonic Compound Bufalin.', 'Mechanisms of prostate cancer cell survival after inhibition of AR expression.', 'Rational design and action mechanisms of chemically innovative organoselenium in cancer therapy.', 'Seleno-Analogs of Scaffolds Resembling Natural Products a Novel Warhead toward Dual Compounds.', 'Seleno-aspirin compound AS-10 promotes histone acetylation ahead of suppressing androgen receptor transcription, G1 arrest, and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.', 'A feedback loop between the androgen receptor and 6-phosphogluoconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) drives prostate cancer growth.', 'ASC-J9® suppresses prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion via altering the ATF3-PTK2 signaling.', 'Roles of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biological Behaviors of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Unfortunately, the diagnostic gold-standard of ultrasound-guided biopsy misses 10%-30% of all cancers. The objective of this study was to develop an electrical impedance tomography (EIT) approach that has the potential to image the entire prostate using multiple impedance measurements recorded between electrodes integrated onto an end-fired transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) device and a biopsy probe (BP).  Approach:   Simulations and sensitivity analyses were used to investigate the best combination of electrodes, and measured tank experiments were used to evaluate a fused-data transrectal EIT (fd-TREIT) and BP approach.  Main results:   Simulations and sensitivity analysis revealed that (1) TREIT measurements are not sufficiently sensitive to image the whole prostate, (2) the combination of TREIT + BP measurements increases the sensitive region of TREIT-only measurements by 12×, and (3) the fusion of multiple TREIT + BP measurements collected during a routine or customized 12-core biopsy procedure can cover up to 76.1% or 94.1% of a nominal 50 cm3 prostate, respectively. Three measured tank experiments of the fd-TREIT + BP approach successfully and accurately recovered the positions of 2-3 metal or plastic inclusions.

A total of 308 patients (355 lesions) were enrolled in this study. Diagnostic efficiency was determined. Univariate and multivariate analyses, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and decision curve analysis were performed to determine and compare the predictors of PCa and CSPCa. The results suggested that PI-RADS v2, tPSA, and prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) were independent predictors of PCa and CSPCa. A PI-RADS v2 score ≥4 provided high negative predictive values (91.39% for PCa and 95.69% for CSPCa). A model of PI-RADS combined with PSA and PSAD helped to define a high-risk group (PI-RADS score = 5 and PSAD ≥0.15 ng ml-1 cm-3, with tPSA in the gray zone, or PI-RADS score ≥4 with high tPSA level) with a detection rate of 96.1% for PCa and 93.0% for CSPCa while a low-risk group with a detection rate of 6.1% for PCa and 2.2% for CSPCa. It was concluded that the PI-RADS v2 could be used as a reliable and independent predictor of PCa and CSPCa. The combination of PI-RADS v2 score with PSA and PSAD could be helpful in the prediction and diagnosis of PCa and CSPCa and, thus, may help in preventing unnecessary invasive procedures.""","""['Chang Liu', 'Shi-Liang Liu', 'Zhi-Xian Wang', 'Kai Yu', 'Chun-Xiang Feng', 'Zan Ke', 'Liang Wang', 'Xiao-Yong Zeng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['How to make clinical decisions to avoid unnecessary prostate screening in biopsy-naïve men with PI-RADs v2 score\u2009≤\u20093?', 'Preliminary applicability evaluation of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 diagnostic score in 3.0T multi-parameters magnetic resonance imaging combined with prostate specific antigen density for prostate cancer.', 'The clinical decision-making value of prostate specific antigen and its derived indicators in prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 3 lesions.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Patients With ""Gray Zone"" PSA Levels: Application of Prostate MRI and MRS in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'MRI-Based Radiomics Nomogram for Predicting Prostate Cancer with Gray-Zone Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels to Reduce Unnecessary Biopsies.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Predictive Models for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Combining prostate-specific antigen density with prostate imaging reporting and data system score version 2.1 to improve detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: A retrospective study.', 'Magnetic Resonance Image Compilation Was Used in Conjunction with Prostate PI-RADS v2.1 Score Has Diagnostic Relevance for Benign and Malignant Prostate Lesions.', 'Comparative Analysis of PSA Density and an MRI-Based Predictive Model to Improve the Selection of Candidates for Prostate Biopsy.']"""

Psoralea corylifolia has been used to cure this disease as Chinese medicine in the Asian region. In this study, we analyzed the components of ethanol extraction of unprepared and prepared P. corylifolia by HPLC. Psoralen and isopsoralen content from the prepared P. corylifolia is twofold higher than that from unprepared, so we use the prepared extraction in this study. However, the effects of the ethanol extraction of P. corylifolia (PCE) on PC-3 human prostate cancer cells remain unclear. PC-3 cells were treated with PCE for different time periods and cells were examined for cell morphological change and total viable cells by using contrast phase microscopy and flow cytometer, respectively. Results indicated that PCE induced cell morphological changes and cytotoxic effect in PC-3 cells in dose-dependent manners. PCE induced chromatin condensation of PC-3 cells dose-dependently. PCE also induced apoptosis and autophagy in PC-3 by western blotting and acridine orange (AO) staining, respectively. Furthermore, a complementary DNA microarray analysis demonstrated that PCE treatment led to 944 genes upregulation and 872 genes downregulation. For example, the DNA damage-associated gene DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT 3) had a 62.1-fold upregulation and CDK1 2.68-fold downregulation. The differential genes were classified according to the Gene Ontology. Furthermore, GeneGo software was used for the key genes involved and their possible interaction pathways.

Here, we present a single-institution study of the frequency and severity of seed slippage (initial seed movement) of coated seeds in comparison with uncoated seeds.  Methods:   Forty-seven patients received permanent prostate brachytherapy, with either coated (n = 26) or uncoated (n = 21) seeds. AgX100 125 I seeds, coated or uncoated, and uncoated Model 200 103 Pd seeds were used. During the ultrasound-guided implantation procedure, each implanted seed was categorized as having remained in the implanted position after being placed, having moved slightly, or having left the ultrasound field of view.  Results:   3.1% of the coated seeds (AgX100 seeds, n = 70) and 6.9% of the uncoated seeds (AgX100 and Model 200 seeds, n = 128) were observed to have moved at least 2 mm from their initial implant positions, respectively. The difference in incidence of this movement was 54.4% (P = 0.0026). Coated AgX100 seeds demonstrated a 66.7% lower rate of movement of at least 2 mm than that for uncoated AgX100 seeds (P = 0.038), and a 49.0% lower rate than that for Model 200 seeds (P = 0.021). While no significant differences were noted in prescription dose coverage of the prostate or the studied dosimetric parameters for the organs at risk between the coated and uncoated seeds (P > 0.05) in the CT-based Day-0 postoperative plans, the limited sample size and differences in energies between the 125 I and 103 Pd seeds make further analysis of postoperative dosimetric coverage difficult without additional data directly comparing the coated and uncoated 125 I seeds.

Although the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Screening Trial is underpowered to detect a difference by race in prostate-cancer specific mortality, because of the large study size, there are still sufficient numbers to examine secondary screening outcomes. The objective of this analysis is to examine whether differences exist between black and white participants with respect to screening false-positive rates, biopsy follow-up of men with positive screens, tumor characteristics, and overdiagnosis of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Participants from the PLCO included men aged 55-74 years at baseline. Cancer diagnoses and deaths were identified through study update questionnaires, records of biopsy procedures, and linkage with the National Death Index. Cancer characteristics were obtained by medical abstractors. We used chi-squared tests to assess differences in false-positive rates, biopsy follow-up, and tumor characteristics. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compare incidence and mortality rates adjusting for age and survival rates adjusting for Gleason scores.  Results:   Black men were slightly more likely (14.5%) to have a false-positive PSA test compared to white men (12.4%; P = 0.02) but less likely to have a false-positive digital rectal exam (DRE) (10.9% vs 14.2%, respectively; P < 0.001). Among all men who were screened, black men were significantly more likely to undergo a biopsy than white men (16.5% vs 13.8%, respectively [P = 0.003]) but there was no difference when limited to those with a positive PSA test. Prostate cancer tumors were more likely to be aggressive and to have metastasized in black men compared to white men. Disparities in incidence, mortality, and survival rates were comparable to those seen in population-based data.

Currently, there are no effective durable therapies for patients with mCRPC. High expression of galectin-1 (Gal-1) is associated with prostate cancer progression and poor clinical outcome. The role of Gal-1 in tumor progression is largely unknown. Here, we characterized Gal-1 functions and evaluated the therapeutic effects of a newly developed Gal-1 inhibitor, LLS30, in mCRPC.Experimental Design: Cell viability, colony formation, migration, and invasion assays were performed to examine the effects of inhibition of Gal-1 in CRPC cells. We used two human CRPC xenograft models to assess growth-inhibitory effects of LLS30. Genome-wide gene expression analysis was conducted to elucidate the effects of LLS30 on metastatic PC3 cells.Results: Gal-1 was highly expressed in CRPC cells, but not in androgen-sensitive cells. Gal-1 knockdown significantly inhibited CRPC cells' growth, anchorage-independent growth, migration, and invasion through the suppression of androgen receptor (AR) and Akt signaling. LLS30 targets Gal-1 as an allosteric inhibitor and decreases Gal-1-binding affinity to its binding partners. LLS30 showed in vivo efficacy in both AR-positive and AR-negative xenograft models. LLS30 not only can potentiate the antitumor effect of docetaxel to cause complete regression of tumors, but can also effectively inhibit the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cells in vivoConclusions: Our study provides evidence that Gal-1 is an important target for mCRPC therapy, and LLS30 is a promising small-molecule compound that can potentially overcome mCRPC.

Chemical conjugation of E3 to the drugs monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) yields a potent cytotoxic agent that efficiently kills prostate cancer cells in vitro but does not affect normal prostate epithelial cells. Importantly, the E3 aptamer targets tumors in vivo and treatment with the MMAF-E3 conjugate significantly inhibits prostate cancer growth in mice, demonstrating the in vivo utility of aptamer-drug conjugates.

However, this assumption has not been systematically tested due to the technical difficulty of identifying branchpoints and quantifying their usage. Here, we analyzed ∼1.31 trillion reads from 17,164 RNA sequencing data sets to demonstrate that almost all human introns contain multiple branchpoints. This complexity holds even for constitutive introns, 95% of which contain multiple branchpoints, with an estimated five to six branchpoints per intron. Introns upstream of the highly regulated ultraconserved poison exons of SR genes contain twice as many branchpoints as the genomic average. Approximately three-quarters of constitutive introns exhibit tissue-specific branchpoint usage. In an extreme example, we observed a complete switch in branchpoint usage in the well-studied first intron of HBB (β-globin) in normal bone marrow versus metastatic prostate cancer samples.

Methods:   We evaluated two next-generation sequencing (NGS) MSI-detection methods, MSIplus (18 markers) and MSI by Large Panel NGS (> 60 markers), and compared the performance of each NGS method to the most widely used 5-marker MSI-PCR detection system. All methods were evaluated by comparison to targeted whole gene sequencing of DNA mismatch-repair genes, and immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair genes, where available.

Methods:   Seventeen patients who received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (66 Gy in 33 fractions) as adjuvant or salvage therapy after prostatectomy were evaluated. All patients underwent CT scans in both the prone (on a belly board) and supine positions. The target volumes and OARs were delineated on each CT series. The planning target volume (PTV) was extended in every direction to generate the PTV + 0.5 cm, PTV + 1 cm, PTV + 2 cm, PTV + 3 cm, and PTV + 4 cm values. The volumes of the OARs overlapping with the PTV and the extended target volumes in the prone and supine position were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters in the prone and supine position were compared using the paired t-test.  Results:   The mean overlapping volumes of the small intestine for each of the PTV values were as follows (prone position vs. supine position [mean ± SD]): PTV, 1.5 ± 5.5 cm3 vs. 7.9 ± 15.7 cm3 (P = 0.028); PTV + 0.5 cm, 2.6 ± 8.9 cm3 vs. 12.1 ± 22.6 cm3 (P = 0.028); PTV + 1 cm, 3.5 ± 11.4 cm3 vs. 17.1 ± 29.8 cm3 (P = 0.028); PTV + 2 cm, 5.6 ± 14.5 cm3 vs. 26.8 ± 46.9 cm3 (P = 0.028); and PTV + 3 cm, 9.0 ± 17.4 cm3 vs. 36.5 ± 63.2 cm3 (P = 0.019), respectively.

Therefore, developing effective computational models for the prediction of novel associations between diseases and miRNAs could be beneficial for achieving an understanding of disease mechanisms at the miRNA level and the interactions between diseases and miRNAs at the disease level. Thus far, only a few miRNA-disease association pairs are known, and models analyzing miRNA-disease associations based on lncRNA are limited.  Results:   In this study, a new computational method based on a distance correlation set is developed to predict miRNA-disease associations (DCSMDA) by integrating known lncRNA-disease associations, known miRNA-lncRNA associations, disease semantic similarity, and various lncRNA and disease similarity measures. The novelty of DCSMDA is due to the construction of a miRNA-lncRNA-disease network, which reveals that DCSMDA can be applied to predict potential lncRNA-disease associations without requiring any known miRNA-disease associations. Although the implementation of DCSMDA does not require known disease-miRNA associations, the area under curve is 0.8155 in the leave-one-out cross validation. Furthermore, DCSMDA was implemented in case studies of prostatic neoplasms, lung neoplasms and leukaemia, and of the top 10 predicted associations, 10, 9 and 9 associations, respectively, were separately verified in other independent studies and biological experimental studies. In addition, 10 of the 10 (100%) associations predicted by DCSMDA were supported by recent bioinformatical studies.

Diffusional kurtosis and bi-exponential modeling are two popular model-based techniques, whose performance in relation to each other has yet to be fully explored.  Purpose:   To determine the relationship between excess kurtosis and signal fractions derived from bi-exponential modeling in the detection of suspicious prostate lesions.  Material and methods:   This retrospective study analyzed patients with normal prostate tissue (n = 12) or suspicious lesions (n = 13, one lesion per patient), as determined by a radiologist whose clinical care included a high b-value diffusion series. The observed signal intensity was modeled using a bi-exponential decay, from which the signal fraction of the slow-moving component was derived ( SFs). In addition, the excess kurtosis was calculated using the signal fractions and ADCs of the two exponentials ( KCOMP). As a comparison, the kurtosis was also calculated using the cumulant expansion for the diffusion signal ( KCE).  Results:   Both K and KCE were found to increase with SFs within the range of SFs commonly found within the prostate. Voxel-wise receiver operating characteristic performance of SFs, KCE, and KCOMP in discriminating between suspicious lesions and normal prostate tissue was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85 - 0.87), 0.69 (95% CI = 0.68-0.70), and 0.86 (95% CI = 0.86-0.87), respectively.

In our study, the lower expression of miR-195 was appeared in DOC-resistant PC cells (DU145/DOC) rather than DOC-sensitive DU145 cells. The up-regulation of miR-195 lowered the IC50 of DOC, facilitated the apoptosis and inhibited the colony formation ability in DU145/DOC cells. Moreover, we also found that miR-195 had the binding site with clusterin (CLU) by the online TargetScan database mining. Luciferase tests revealed that miR-195 binds to the 3'-UTR of CLU. MiR-195 overexpression decreased the amassment of CLU in DU145/DOC cells. Knockdown of CLU diminished the IC50 of DOC and enhanced the apoptosis of DU145/DOC cells, which was consistent with the influence of miR-195 on DOC-induced cell apoptosis.

The dog can be an interesting model for human prostatic disease, and yet only one previous research study has shown deregulation of NKX3.1 and MYC in the canine prostate. To address the expression of NKX3.1 and C-MYC in different canine prostatic lesions, this study verified the gene and protein expression of NKX3.1 and C-MYC in normal canine prostatic tissues. We identified a 26 kDa band that corresponded to the NKX3.1 protein, while C-MYC showed a 50 kDa band on Western blotting analysis of all prostatic tissues. We observed that NKX3.1 protein and transcript were down-regulated in prostate cancer (PC) samples compared with non-neoplastic samples. We also observed that C-MYC protein was overexpressed in PC samples compared with normal (P = .001) and proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) samples (P = .003). We found a positive correlation between NKX3.1 and C-MYC protein expression in normal and PIA samples. Interestingly, a negative correlation (NKX3.1 downregulation and MYC overexpression) was observed between NKX3.1 and MYC transcripts in PC. Thus, samples with higher C-MYC expression also exhibited higher NKX3.1 expression, which indicates the regulation of C-MYC by NKX3.1 protein.

Therefore, we first investigated the expression levels of and the associations between lamin A/C and several common EMT markers, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, β-catenin, snail, slug and vimentin in PC tissues with different GS values and in different cell lines with varying invasion abilities. Our results suggest that lamin A/C might constitute a type of epithelial marker that better signifies EMT and MET in PC tissue, since a decrease in lamin A/C expression in GS 4 + 5 cases is likely associated with the EMT process, while the re-expression of lamin A/C in GS 5 + 4 cases is likely linked with MET. The detailed GS better exhibited the changes in lamin A/C and the EMT markers examined. Lamin A/C overexpression or knockdown had an impact on EMT biomarkers in a cell model by direct regulation of β-catenin.

All the members of the EGFR/ErbB family are primary goals for cancer therapy, particularly for tumors of breast, cervix, ovaries, kidney, esophagus, prostate and non-small-cell lung carcinoma and head and neck tumors. However, the therapeutic ability of accessible anti-ErbB agents is limited. Therefore, recognizing EGF analogues or small organic molecules with high affinity for the extracellular domain of the EGFR is a critical target on cancer research. An effective EGF analogue should have a comparable binding affinity for EGFR in order to create an effective ligand competitive inhibition against circulating wild EGF while fails to transduce appropriate downstream signaling into the cancer cell. In our earlier study we have developed a mutant form of human EGF (mEGF, lacking the four critical amino acid residues; Gln43, Tyr44, Arg45 and Asp46 at the C-terminal of the protein) and its binding properties and mitogenic activity were assessed. The mEGF showed high affinity for EGFR binding domains but caused poor EGFR dimerization and phosphorylation and especially, mEGF induced EGFR internalization. However, underlying mechanism of action of EGF analogues is still unclear and thus considered to be worthwhile for further study. With regard to different effects of the EGF analogue on EGFR activating process, computational analysis of wild EGF/EGFR and mEGF/EGFR complexes (along with EGFt/EGFR complex) were done. Results of the protein dissection identified several interactions within ""ligand/EGFR"" that are common among EGF and EGFt/mEGF. These results disclose that while several interactions are conserved within EGF/EGFR interfaces, EGF/EGFR interactions on site III interface controls the affinity, EGFR dimerization and subsequent downstream signaling through a heterogeneous set of non-covalent interactions.

Here we describe a gene signature that could guide clinicians in the selection of patients with intermediate stage clinically localized prostate cancer for active surveillance. We examined six major drivers of aggressive disease - PTEN, MYC, RB1, TP53, AURKA, AR - by immunohistochemistry in a focused (N = 69) cohort predominantly consisting of intermediate risk prostate cancer. Fuzzy clustering and unsupervised hierarchical clustering were utilized to determine the correlation of gene expression and methylation values with immunohistochemical expression. From the immunohistochemistry observation, we found that intermediate risk prostate cancer cases could be classified as 'complex' (differential expression of more than one driver) or 'simple' (differential expression of only one). Focussing on the 'simple' cases, expression and methylation profiling generated signatures which correlated tightly only with differential PTEN expression and not with any of the other drivers assessed by immunohistochemistry. From this, we derived a geneset of 35 genes linked to high PTEN expression. Subsequently we determined its prognostic significance in intermediate-risk cases extracted from three publicly available clinical datasets (Total N = 215). Hence, this study shows that, by using immunohistochemistry as an upfront stratifier of intermediate risk prostate cancers, it is possible to identify through differential gene expression profiling a geneset with prognostic power across multiple cohorts. This strategy has not been used previously and the signature has the potential to impact on treatment decisions in patients for whom decision making is currently empirical at best.""","""['Chee W Ong', 'Pamela Maxwell', 'Muhammad A Alvi', 'Stephen McQuaid', 'David Waugh', 'Ian Mills', 'Manuel Salto-Tellez']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Pathol Clin Res""","""['Comparing Prognostic Utility of a Single-marker Immunohistochemistry Approach with Commercial Gene Expression Profiling Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'An immunohistochemical signature comprising PTEN, MYC, and Ki67 predicts progression in prostate cancer patients receiving adjuvant docetaxel after prostatectomy.', 'Integration of copy number and transcriptomics provides risk stratification in prostate cancer: A discovery and validation cohort study.', 'βIII-tubulin overexpression is an independent predictor of prostate cancer progression tightly linked to ERG fusion status and PTEN deletion.', 'Which, when and why?

Theranostic gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-directed radiopeptides have been proposed for the management of GRPR-expressing prostate and breast cancers. We have recently introduced the PET tracer 68Ga-SB3 (SB3, DOTA- p-aminomethylaniline-diglycolic acid-DPhe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-NHEt), a receptor-radioantagonist that enables the visualization of GRPR-positive lesions in humans. Aiming to fully assess the theranostic potential of SB3, we herein report on the impact of switching 68Ga to 111In/177Lu-label on the biological properties of resulting radiopeptides. Notably, the bioavailability of 111In/177Lu-SB3 in mice drastically deteriorated compared with metabolically robust 68Ga-SB3, and as a result led to poorer 111In/177Lu-SB3 uptake in GRPR-positive PC-3 xenografts. The peptide cleavage sites were identified by chromatographic comparison of blood samples from mice intravenously receiving 111In/177Lu-SB3 with each of newly synthesized 111In/177Lu-SB3-fragments. Coinjection of the radioconjugates with the neprilysin (NEP)-inhibitor phosphoramidon led to full stabilization of 111In/177Lu-SB3 in peripheral mouse blood and resulted in markedly enhanced radiolabel uptake in the PC-3 tumors. In conclusion, in situ NEP-inhibition led to indistinguishable 68Ga/111In/177Lu-SB3 profiles in mice emphasizing the theranostic prospects of SB3 for clinical use.""","""['Emmanouil Lymperis', 'Aikaterini Kaloudi', 'Werner Sallegger', 'Ingrid L Bakker', 'Eric P Krenning', 'Marion de Jong', 'Theodosia Maina', 'Berthold A Nock']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Theranostic Perspectives in Prostate Cancer with the Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist NeoBOMB1: Preclinical and First Clinical Results.', 'Preclinical and first clinical experience with the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-antagonist ⁶⁸GaSB3 and PET/CT.', 'Comparing Gly11/dAla11-Replacement vs. the in-Situ Neprilysin-Inhibition Approach on the Tumor-targeting Efficacy of the 111In-SB3/111In-SB4 Radiotracer Pair.', 'Theranostic Prospects of Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor-Radioantagonists in Oncology.', 'GRPr Theranostics: Current Status of Imaging and Therapy using GRPr Targeting Radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Preclinical Characterization of a Stabilized Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist for Targeted Cancer Theranostics.', 'Peptide Radioligands in Cancer Theranostics: Agonists and Antagonists.', 'Optimization of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of 99mTcTc-N4-Bombesin Derivatives by Modification of the Pharmacophoric Gln-Trp Sequence.', 'The Chemical Scaffold of Theranostic Radiopharmaceuticals: Radionuclide, Bifunctional Chelator, and Pharmacokinetics Modifying Linker.', 'Radiolabeled Bombesin Analogs.']"""

Materials and Methods This retrospective cohort study included 120 consecutively selected multiparametric prostate MR imaging studies performed between November 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016. Sham clinical data in four domains (digital rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen level, plan for biopsy, prior prostate cancer history) were randomly assigned to each case by using a balanced orthogonal design. Six fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists independently reviewed the sham data, actual patient age, and each examination while they were blinded to interreader scoring, true clinical data, and histologic findings. Readers were told the constant sham histories were true, believed the study to be primarily investigating interrater agreement, and were asked to assign a maximum PI-RADS v2 score to each case. Linear regression was performed to assess the association between clinical variables and maximum PI-RADS v2 score designation. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were obtained to compare interreader scoring. Results Clinical information had no significant effect on maximum PI-RADS v2 scoring for any of the six readers (P = .09-.99, 42 reader-variable pairs). Distributions of maximum PI-RADS v2 scores in the research context were similar to the distribution of the scores assigned clinically and had fair-to-excellent pairwise interrater agreement (ICC range: 0.53-0.76). Overall interrater agreement was good (ICC: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.57, 0.71). Conclusion Clinical history does not appear to be a substantial bias in maximum PI-RADS v2 score assignment.

Conventional denoising methods compromise edge resolution and low-contrast object visibility. In this work, we incorporated block-matching 3D-transform shrinkage (BM3D) transformation into MVCT iterative reconstruction as nonlocal patch-wise regularization.  Methods:   The iterative reconstruction was achieved by adding to the existing least square data fidelity objective a regularization term, formulated as the L1 norm of the BM3D transformed image. A Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) was adopted to accelerate CT reconstruction. The proposed method was compared against total variation (TV) regularization, BM3D postprocess method, and filtered back projection (FBP).  Results:   In the Catphan phantom study, BM3D regularization better enhances low-contrast objects compared with TV regularization and BM3D postprocess method at the same noise level. The spatial resolution using BM3D regularization is 2.79 and 2.55 times higher than that using the TV regularization at 50% of the modulation transfer function (MTF) magnitude, for the fully sampled reconstruction and down-sampled reconstruction, respectively. The BM3D regularization images show better bony details and low-contrast soft tissues, on the head and neck (H&N) and prostate patient images.

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that obesity promotes aggressive PCa. Recently, a family of Free Fatty Acid (FFA) receptors (FFARs) has been identified and reported to affect several crucial biological functions of tumor cells such as proliferation, invasiveness, and apoptosis. Here we report that oleic acid (OA), one of the most prevalent FFA in human plasma, increases proliferation of highly malignant PC3 and DU-145 PCa cells. Furthermore, docetaxel cytotoxic action, the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of androgen-independent PCa, was significantly reduced in the presence of OA, when measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, suggesting that this FFA plays also a role in chemoresistance. OA induced intracellular calcium increase, in part due to the store operated calcium entry (SOCE), measured by a calcium imaging technique. Moreover, PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was enhanced, as revealed by increased Akt phosphorylation levels. Intriguingly, attenuating the expression of FFA1/GPR40, a receptor for long chain FFA including OA, prevented the OA-induced effects.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the body mass index (BMI) on pulmonary changes in a permanent 45° steep Trendelenburg position (STP) during robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). 51 patients undergoing RALP under standardized anesthesia were included. Perioperative pulmonary function and oxygenation were measured in awake patients (T0), 20 min after the induction of anesthesia (T1), after insufflation of the abdomen in supine position (T2), after 30 min in STP (T3), when controlling Santorini's plexus in STP (T4), before awakening while supine (T5), and after 45 min in the recovery room (T6). Patient-specific and time-dependent factor on ventilation and predicted peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), driving pressure (Pdriv) and lung compliance (LC) in a linear regression model were calculated. PIP and Pdriv increased significantly after induction of capnoperitoneum (T2-4) (p < 0.0001). In univariate mixed effects models, BMI was found to be a significant predictor for PIP and Pdriv increase and LC decrease. Obese patients a BMI > 31 kg/m2 reached critical PIP values ≥ 35 cmH2O. Postoperative oxygenation represented by the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly decreased compared to T0 (p < 0.0001). Obesity in combination with STP and capnoperitoneum during RALP has a profound effect on pulmonary function. Increased PIP and Pdriv and decreased LC are directly correlated with a high BMI. Changes in PIP, Pdriv and LC during RALP may be predicted in relation to patient's BMI for consideration in the preoperative setting. Trial registration number Z-2014-0387-6.

Notably, systemic administration of tCoa-NGR to mice bearing 4T1 mouse mammary xenografts or PC3 human prostate tumors resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth. These anti-tumor effects were accompanied by massive thrombotic occlusion of small and large tumor vessels, tumor infarction and tumor cell death.

This study showed that upregulation of SPAG5 was detected frequently in primary BUC tissues, and was associated with significantly worse survival among the 112 patients that underwent radical cystectomy (RC). Up and downregulating the expression of SPAG5 enhanced or inhibited, respectively, the proliferation of BUC cells in vitro and in vivo, and suppressed or enhanced, respectively, apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, SPAG5 increased the resistance of BUC cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations showed that SPAG5 promotes proliferation and suppresses apoptosis in BUC at least partially via upregulating Wnt3 through activating the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The importance of the SPAG5/AKT-mTOR/Wnt3 axis identified in BUC cell models was confirmed via immunohistochemical analysis of a cohort of human BUC specimens that underwent RC.

It is unclear if this is due to specific tumor-promoting effects of obesity or diagnostic bias. Patients undergoing prostatectomy were categorized according to their body mass index (BMI). Expected prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were calculated for each patient based on tumor characteristics. The effect of obesity on the accuracy of pre-treatment risk categorization was determined, and mediation analysis was used to identify the contribution of biologic vs non-biologic mechanisms to the observed increased risk of biochemical recurrence. Residual tumor-promoting effects were estimated in a survival model controlling for diagnostic error. The following results were obtained. The analysis included 1587 patients. Despite similar rates of adverse pathological features at prostatectomy, biochemical recurrence rates were significantly higher in very obese patients, which persisted after adjustment for stage, grade and PSA. Tumor volume however correlated significantly with BMI (P = 0.004), and the difference in predicted and observed 'tumor-attributable' PSA (Delta-PSA) in very obese patients was greater than three times higher than that of healthy patients (P = 0.0067). Regression analysis indicated that the effect of BMI on tumor volume was fully mediated indirectly by its effect on PSA. Inclusion of this diagnostic error as a covariate in the survival analysis attenuated the effect of BMI on recurrence. In conclusion, being very obese suppresses tumor-associated PSA resulting in a diagnostic bias that is responsible for errors in risk classification, and potentially contributes to a delay in initial presentation.""","""['Ken Chow', 'Stefano Mangiola', 'Jaideep Vazirani', 'Justin S Peters', 'Anthony J Costello', 'Christopher M Hovens', 'Niall M Corcoran']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Obesity and oncological outcome after radical prostatectomy: impact of prostate-specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital and Duke Prostate Center databases.', 'The role of the digital rectal examination as diagnostic test for prostate cancer detection in obese patients.', 'Correlation of High Body Mass Index With More Advanced Localized Prostate Cancer at Radical Prostatectomy Is Not Reflected in PSA Level and PSA Density but Is Seen in PSA Mass.', 'Obese men have higher-grade and larger tumors: an analysis of the duke prostate center database.', 'The effect of body mass index on PSA levels and the development, screening and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy promotes an obesity-like microenvironment in periprostatic fat.']"""

Materials and methods:   We present the clinical and pathologic aspects of two patients who underwent IBT for low stage prostate cancer that was complicated by deep rectal ulcer. Both patients underwent extensive palliative surgical resection for disease control.  Results:   The histologic changes in both cases were noteworthy for extensive necrosis and inflammation of the prostate, associated with loss of recto-prostatic anatomical landmarks. Prostatic glands showed striking radiation-induced atypia and pseudomalignant epithelial changes extending to the rectal ulcer bed, with no residual viable tumor. The first patient had undergone a biopsy of the rectal ulcer bed that was misinterpreted as a rectal adenocarcinoma prior to surgery. The similarity between atypical glands of the biopsy and the benign prostatic tissue with radiation-induced atypia in resection specimen confirmed their benign nature.

Design, setting, participants, and intervention:   During the clinical phase II studies, 68 patients were treated with VTP under optimal treatment conditions (WST11 at 4mg/kg, light energy at 200J/cm, and a light density index ≥1) and have been included in a 3.5-yr follow-up.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Post-interventional visits were scheduled every 6 mo and conducted as per local standard practice in each study center.

Results and limitations:   At the end of the 3.5-yr follow-up, overall successful focal ablation was achieved for 51 patients (75%). Cancer was identified in the untreated lobe in 17 patients (25%).

Focal therapy of the prostate with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an organ-preserving treatment for prostate cancer with less impairment of health-related quality of life. Follow-up after HIFU therapy by imaging modalities remains a major problem as eg. MRI performs poorly. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) allows to monitor the vascular architecture of organs non-invasively. However, only limited data are available using CEUS to define successful and complete HIFU treatment of the prostate. In this study, we aimed to evaluate short-term image findings using CEUS and image fusion before and after HIFU treatment.  Materials and methods:   Prospective single arm study in patients with uni- or bilateral, low or intermediate risk prostate cancer or recurrent cancer after radiotherapy treated with HIFU at our institution between October 2016 and November 2017. HIFU hemiablation or whole gland treatment was performed using the Focal One® device. PCa was diagnosed either by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) followed by MRI fusion based targeted biopsy combined with 12 core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy or 12 core random biopsy only. Monitoring of the target region before, immediately and 24 hours after the ablation was done by CEUS in combination with image fusion using an axial T2-weighted MRI sequence.  Results:   6 consecutive patients with Gleason score (GS) 6, 5 patients with GS 7a prostate cancer and one patient with biochemical recurrence after radiotherapy were included in the study. Three patients underwent whole gland treatment due to histological proven bilateral PCa or recurrent PCa after radiotherapy. Hemiablation was performed in 9 patients with unilateral tumor and no PIRADS 4 or 5 lesion in the contralateral lobe. Median patient age was 69.8 years and median PSA (prostate-specific antigen) level was 8.4 ng/ml. CEUS showed markedly reduced microbubbles in the ablated area, the prostate capsule still showed signs of perfusion. The study is limited by the short follow up and small number of patients.  Conclusions:   CEUS examination showed a reduction of microcirculation in the treated area immediately after the treatment and 24 hours later. The combination of CEUS and image fusion seems to be helpful for detecting the PCa target lesion and monitor the success of HIFU ablation treatment. Evidence for image findings after HIFU-therapy are rare. Further studies on this topic are needed.""","""['M Apfelbeck', 'D-A Clevert', 'J Ricke', 'C Stief', 'B Schlenker']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Hemorheol Microcirc""","""['Follow-up after focal therapy of the prostate with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) using contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in combination with MRI image fusion.', 'Prostate cancer treatment by the latest focal HIFU device with MRI/TRUS-fusion control biopsies: A prospective evaluation.', 'The utility of intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound in detecting residual disease after focal HIFU for localized prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Current status and future prospective of focal therapy for localized prostate cancer: development of multiparametric MRI, MRI-TRUS fusion image-guided biopsy, and treatment modalities.', 'Real-Time and Delayed Imaging of Tissue and Effects of Prostate Tissue Ablation.', 'Applications of Focused Ultrasound in the Treatment of Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Sonography of the prostate : Relevance for urologists in daily clinical routine.', 'MR Imaging in Real Time Guiding of Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'The safety of echo contrast-enhanced ultrasound in high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation for abdominal wall endometriosis: a retrospective study.']"""

The authors used latent profile analysis (LPA) to group men according to their symptom burden and functional status and to identify patient characteristics associated with each HRQOL profile.  Methods:   Patients completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System and the Expanded Prostate Index Composite measures 3 months after treatment initiation. Anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, diarrhea, urinary obstruction, urinary incontinence, erectile function, and sex satisfaction were modeled jointly using LPA, and the analysis was adjusted for covariates to examine associations between patient characteristics and profiles.  Results:   One-third of the 373 men were not non-Hispanic white (26% were black). Four LPA profiles were identified. Men who experienced the ""best HRQOL"" were less likely to receive treatment, to be older, and to smoke. Men in the second best profile experienced symptoms similar to men in the best HRQOL group but reported poor sexual and urinary function, because they were more likely to receive therapy. The third profile included men with increased symptom burden and poor functioning who were likely to undergo prostatectomy and to have increased comorbidity. The ""worst HRQOL"" group experienced the worst symptoms and the poorest functioning, and these men were more likely to be younger, to have more comorbidities, and to smoke.  Conclusions:   LPA revealed that men who receive the same treatment can experience very different HRQOL impact. Understanding the factors most associated with poorer HRQOL allows clinicians to focus their care on individuals most in need of symptom management and support.

Methods:   We investigated the hierarchy of selenoprotein expression in response to selenium concentration variation in four cell lines originating from kidney (HEK293, immortalized), prostate (LNCaP, cancer), skin (HaCaT, immortalized) and liver (HepG2, cancer), using complementary analytical methods. We performed (i) enzymatic activity, (ii) RT-qPCR, (iii) immuno-detection, (iv) selenium-specific mass spectrometric detection after non-radioactive 76Se labeling of selenoproteins, and (v) luciferase-based reporter constructs in various cell extracts.  Results:   We characterized cell-line specific alterations of the selenoproteome in response to selenium variation that, in most of the cases, resulted from a translational control of gene expression. We established that UGA-selenocysteine recoding efficiency, which depends on the nature of the SECIS element, dictates the response to selenium variation.  Conclusions:   We characterized that selenoprotein hierarchy is cell-line specific with conserved features. This analysis should be done prior to any experiments in a novel cell line.

Materials and methods:   The study population consisted of 211 AA men from 7 urology centers across the United States; all of whom were undergoing 12-core transrectal ultrasound-guided repeat biopsy within 30 months from a negative index biopsy. All biopsy cores from the negative index biopsy were profiled for the epigenetic biomarkers GSTP1, APC, and RASSF1 using ConfirmMDx for Prostate Cancer (MDxHealth, Irvine, CA).  Results:   Upon repeat biopsy, 130 of 211 subjects (62%) had no prostate cancer (PCa) detected and 81 of 211 (38%) were diagnosed with PCa. Of the subjects with PCa, 54 (67%) were diagnosed with Gleason score (GS) ≤6 PCa and 27 (33%) with GS ≥7 disease. For detection of PCa at repeat biopsy, ConfirmMDx sensitivity was 74.1% and specificity was 60.0%, equivalent to prior studies (P = .235 and .697, respectively). For detection of GS ≥7 PCa, sensitivity was 78% and specificity was 53%. The negative predictive values for detection of all PCa and GS ≥7 PCa were 78.8% and 94.2%, respectively.  Conclusion:   In this group of AA men, we successfully validated an epigenetic assay to assess the need for repeat biopsy. Results were consistent with previous studies from predominantly Caucasian populations.

In the USA alone, it leads to 15 000 deaths every year. In the present study, we investigated the role of 3-((4'-amino-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)amino)-4-bromo-5-oxo-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-yl acetate (ABDHFA) in the inhibition of bladder cancer cell viability. MATERIAL AND METHODS Viability of cells was examined using MTT assay and distribution of cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry. Expression of cyclin D1, androgen, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and miR-449a was analyzed using Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS The results demonstrated that ABDHFA treatment inhibited viability of UMUC3 and TCCSUP AR-positive bladder cancer cells. ABDHFA treatment led to break-down of AR in UMUC3 and TCCSUP cells after 48 h in a dose-dependent manner. Up-regulation of miR-449a by lentivirus transfection down-regulated the AR signalling pathway. In UMUC3 and TCCSUP cells, ABDHFA treatment led to inhibition of mRNA and protein expression corresponding to AR. CONCLUSIONS In summary, the present study demonstrates that proliferation of AR-positive bladder carcinoma cells is markedly reduced by ABDHFA treatment through arrest of cell cycle and degradation of AR protein. Thus, ABDHFA, a novel compound, can be used for the treatment of bladder cancer.""","""['Ju Guo', 'Jieping Hu', 'Runfu Cao', 'Qingsheng Chen', 'Kanghua Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Capsaicin causes inactivation and degradation of the androgen receptor by inducing the restoration of miR-449a in prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide inhibits androgen receptor-positive bladder cancer cell growth.', 'Compound A Inhibits Bladder Cancer Growth Predominantly via Glucocorticoid Receptor Transrepression.', 'Dihydrotestosterone upregulates the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and ERBB2 in androgen receptor-positive bladder cancer cells.', 'miR-449a Regulates proliferation and chemosensitivity to cisplatin by targeting cyclin D1 and BCL2 in SGC7901 cells.', 'The androgen receptor in bladder cancer.', 'Interaction between Non-Coding RNAs and Androgen Receptor with an Especial Focus on Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor-Related Non-coding RNAs in Prostate Cancer.', 'Diagnostic Value of Combination of MicroRNA-192 in Urinary Sediment and B-Ultrasound for Bladder Cancer.']"""

Purpose:   To develop an automatic approach based on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to classify PCa and noncancerous tissues (NC) with mp-MRI.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Subjects:   In all, 195 patients with localized PCa were collected from a PROSTATEx database. In total, 159/17/19 patients with 444/48/55 observations (215/23/23 PCas and 229/25/32 NCs) were randomly selected for training/validation/testing, respectively.  Sequence:   T2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted, and apparent diffusion coefficient images.  Assessment:   A radiologist manually labeled the regions of interest of PCas and NCs and estimated the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores for each region. Inspired by VGG-Net, we designed a patch-based DCNN model to distinguish between PCa and NCs based on a combination of mp-MRI data. Additionally, an enhanced prediction method was used to improve the prediction accuracy. The performance of DCNN prediction was tested using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Moreover, the predicted result was compared with the PI-RADS score to evaluate its clinical value using decision curve analysis.  Statistical test:   Two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test with statistical significance set at 0.05.  Results:   The DCNN produced excellent diagnostic performance in distinguishing between PCa and NC for testing datasets with an AUC of 0.944 (95% confidence interval: 0.876-0.994), sensitivity of 87.0%, specificity of 90.6%, PPV of 87.0%, and NPV of 90.6%. The decision curve analysis revealed that the joint model of PI-RADS and DCNN provided additional net benefits compared with the DCNN model and the PI-RADS scheme.  Data conclusion:   The proposed DCNN-based model with enhanced prediction yielded high performance in statistical analysis, suggesting that DCNN could be used in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for PCa classification.

PSA is enzymatically active in the tumor microenvironment but is presumed to be enzymatically inactive in the blood due to complex formation with serum protease inhibitors α-1-antichymotrypsin and α-2-macroglobulin (A2M). PSA-A2M complexes cannot be measured by standard ELISA assays and are also rapidly cleared from the circulation. Thus the exact magnitude of PSA production by prostate cancer cells is not easily measured. The PSA complexed to A2M is unable to cleave proteins but maintains the ability to cleave small peptide substrates. Thus, in advanced prostate cancer, sufficient PSA-A2M may be in circulation to effect total A2M levels, levels of cytokines bound to A2M and hydrolyze small circulating peptide hormones.  Methods:   Total A2M levels in men with advanced prostate cancer and PSA levels above 1000 ng/mL were measured by ELISA and compared to controls. Additional ELISA assays were used to measure levels of IL-6 and TGF-beta which can bind to A2M. The ability of PSA-A2M complexes to hydrolyze protein and peptide substrates was analyzed ± PSA inhibitor. Enzymatic activity of PSA-A2M in serum of men with high PSA levels was also assayed.  Results:   Serum A2M levels are inversely correlated with PSA levels in men with advanced prostate cancer. Il-6 Levels are significantly elevated in men with PSA >1000 ng/mL compared to controls with PSA <0.1 ng/mL. PSA-A2M complex in serum of men with PSA levels >1000 ng/mL can hydrolyze small fluorescently labeled peptide substrates but not large proteins that are PSA substrates. PSA can hydrolyze small peptide hormones like PTHrP and osteocalcin. PSA complexed to A2M retains the ability to degrade PTHrP.  Conclusions:   In advanced prostate cancer with PSA levels >1000 ng/mL, sufficient PSA-A2M is present in circulation to produce enzymatic activity against circulating small peptide hormones. Sufficient PSA is produced in advanced prostate cancer to alter total A2M levels, which can potentially alter levels of a variety of growth factors such as IL-6, TGF-beta, basic FGF, and PDGF. Alterations in levels of these cytokines and proteolytic degradation of small peptide hormones may have profound effect on host-cancer interaction.""","""['Maya B Kostova', 'William Nathaniel Brennen', 'David Lopez', 'Lizamma Anthony', 'Hao Wang', 'Elizabeth Platz', 'Samuel R Denmeade']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Determination of prostate-specific antigen complexed to alpha(2)-macroglobulin in serum increases the specificity of free to total PSA for prostate cancer.', 'Characterization and immunological determination of the complex between prostate-specific antigen and alpha2-macroglobulin.', 'Complex formation between PSA isoenzymes and protease inhibitors.', 'Free/total prostate-specific antigen ratio--hope and controversies.', 'Prostate specific antigen predominantly forms a complex with alpha 1-antichymotrypsin in blood.

In this study, we develop a novel integrated optimization method for VMAT, accounting for dynamic collimator angles during the arc motion.  Methods:   Direct Aperture Optimization (DAO) for Dynamic Collimator in VMAT (DC-VMAT) was achieved by adding to the existing dose fidelity objective an anisotropic total variation term for regulating the fluence smoothness, a binary variable for forming simple apertures, and a group sparsity term for controlling collimator rotation. The optimal collimator angle for each beam angle was selected using the Dijkstra's algorithm, where the node costs depend on the estimated fluence map at the current iteration and the edge costs account for the mechanical constraints of multi-leaf collimator (MLC). An alternating optimization strategy was implemented to solve the DAO and collimator angle selection (CAS). Feasibility of DC-VMAT using one full-arc with dynamic collimator rotation was tested on a phantom with two small spherical targets, a brain, a lung and a prostate cancer patient. The plan was compared against a static collimator VMAT (SC-VMAT) plan using three full arcs with 60 degrees of collimator angle separation in patient studies.  Results:   With the same target coverage, DC-VMAT achieved 20.3% reduction of R50 in the phantom study, and reduced the average max and mean OAR dose by 4.49% and 2.53% of the prescription dose in patient studies, as compared with SC-VMAT. The collimator rotation co-ordinated with the gantry rotation in DC-VMAT plans for deliverability. There were 13 beam angles in the single-arc DC-VMAT plan in patient studies that requires slower gantry rotation to accommodate multiple collimator angles.  Conclusions:   The novel DC-VMAT approach utilizes the dynamic collimator rotation during arc delivery. In doing so, DC-VMAT affords more sophisticated intensity modulation, alleviating the limitation previously imposed by the square beamlet from the MLC leaf thickness and achieves higher effective modulation resolution. Consequently, DC-VMAT with a single arc manages to achieve superior dosimetry than SC-VMAT with three full arcs.""","""['Qihui Lyu', ""Daniel O'Connor"", 'Dan Ruan', 'Victoria Yu', 'Dan Nguyen', 'Ke Sheng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A novel optimization framework for VMAT with dynamic gantry couch rotation.', 'Single-arc VMAT optimization for dual-layer MLC.', 'A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Total marrow irradiation for hematopoietic malignancies using volumetric modulated arc therapy: A review of treatment planning studies.', 'Robust Angle Selection in Particle Therapy.', 'Cardiac Dose Control and Optimization Strategy for Left Breast Cancer Radiotherapy With Non-Uniform VMAT Technology.', 'Optimization of collimator angles in dual-arc volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for whole-brain radiotherapy with hippocampus and inner ear sparing.', 'Evaluation of novel AI-based extended field-of-view CT reconstructions.', 'ROAD: ROtational direct Aperture optimization with a Decoupled ring-collimator for FLASH radiotherapy.', 'DeepMC: a deep learning method for efficient Monte Carlo beamlet dose calculation by predictive denoising in magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy.']"""

Constructing such a phylogenetic tree from genome sequencing data is a challenging task due to the many types of mutations in cancer and the fact that nearly all cancer sequencing is of a bulk tumor, measuring a superposition of somatic mutations present in different cells. We study the problem of reconstructing tumor phylogenies from copy-number aberrations (CNAs) measured in bulk-sequencing data. We introduce the Copy-Number Tree Mixture Deconvolution (CNTMD) problem, which aims to find the phylogenetic tree with the fewest number of CNAs that explain the copy-number data from multiple samples of a tumor. We design an algorithm for solving the CNTMD problem and apply the algorithm to both simulated and real data. On simulated data, we find that our algorithm outperforms existing approaches that either perform deconvolution/factorization of mixed tumor samples or build phylogenetic trees assuming homogeneous tumor samples. On real data, we analyze multiple samples from a prostate cancer patient, identifying clones within these samples and a phylogenetic tree that relates these clones and their differing proportions across samples.

In this study, to investigate the role of HIF‑1α and β‑catenin in the radioresistance of PCa, two PCa cell lines, LNCaP and C4‑2B, were grouped as follows: Negative control (no treatment), HIF‑1α overexpression group (transfected with HIF‑1α overexpression plasmid) and β‑catenin silenced group (transfected with HIF‑1α plasmids and β‑catenin-shRNA).

Our results revealed that in both the LNCaP and C4‑2B cells, transfection with HIF‑1α overexpression plasmid led to an enhanced β‑catenin nuclear translocation, while β‑catenin silencing inhibited β‑catenin nuclear translocation. The enhanced β‑catenin nuclear translocation induced by HIF‑1α overexpression resulted in an enhanced cell proliferation and cell invasion, an altered cell cycle distribution, decreased apoptosis, and improved non‑homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair under normal and irradiation conditions. Similar results were observed in the animal models.

There are rural/urban disparities with regards to awareness, screening, treatment, and survivorship. Furthermore, use of traditional medicine and homeopathic remedies is widespread, and some men delay seeking conventional medical treatment until advanced stages of CaP. This study examined the perceptions, beliefs, and practices of men in Cameroon regarding late stage CaP diagnoses; identified factors that influence screening decision; and ascertained how men decided between traditional or conventional medicine for CaP diagnosis and treatment. Semistructured focus groups were used to collect data from men in Bamenda, Cameroon. Qualitative data analysis was used to analyze transcripts for emerging themes and constructs using a socio-ecological framework. Twenty-five men participated in the study, with an average age of 59. Most of the participants had never received a prostate screening recommendation.

Given the documented racial disparities in PCa incidence and mortality, engaging interactions with physicians are especially important for AA/Black men. Thus, this study evaluated occurrence of physician-patient conversations among AA/Black men, and whether such conversations were associated with PCa knowledge. We also quantified the serum PSA values of participants who had, and had not, discussed testing with their physicians. Self-identified AA/Black men living in California and New York, ages 21-85, donated blood and completed a comprehensive sociodemographic and health survey ( n = 414). Less than half (45.2%) of participants had discussed PCa screening with their physicians. Multivariate analyses were used to assess whether physician-patient conversations predicted PCa knowledge after adjusting for key sociodemographic/economic and health-care variables. Increased PCa knowledge was correlated with younger age, higher income and education, and having discussed the pros and cons of PCa testing with a physician. Serum PSA values were measured by ELISA. Higher-than-normal PSA values were found in 38.5% of men who had discussed PCa screening with a physician and 29.1% who had not discussed PCa screening. Our results suggest that physician-AA/Black patient conversations regarding PCa risk need improvement. Encouraging more effective communication between physicians and AA/Black men concerning PCa screening and PSA testing has the potential to reduce PCa health disparities.""","""['Leanne Woods-Burnham', 'Laura Stiel', 'Colwick Wilson', 'Susanne Montgomery', 'Alfonso M Durán', 'Herbert R Ruckle', 'Rupert A Thompson', 'Marino De León', 'Carlos A Casiano']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['Physician Attitudes and Self-reported Practices Toward Prostate Cancer Screening in Black and White Men.', 'National evidence on the use of shared decision making in prostate-specific antigen screening.', 'Do Men Receive Information Required for Shared Decision Making About PSA Testing?

Material and methods:   Experiments were performed with different cancer cell lines (NSCLC: H23, H520, H226, H1975 and PrCa: DU145) growing either under 2D or 3D conditions. Expression of SCF and c-Kit was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot, SCF was knocked down by siRNA, c-Kit was inhibited by ISCK03 inhibitor and cell survival was determined by colony formation assay.  Results:   There is a profound variation in the expression of both c-Kit and SCF with no association between each other. Neither levels did correlate with the respective cellular radiosensitivity determined for 2D or 3D with only a trend seen for SCF. Knock-down of SCF was generally found to result in no or only minor reduction of plating efficiency or cellular radioresistance. A significant reduction was only obtained for H520 cells characterized by an extreme over-expression of SCF. The inhibition of c-Kit by a specific inhibitor was also found to result only in minor radiosensitization.

Notably, NDRG1 phosphorylation and cleavage are associated with its function, although it is unclear if these modifications occur universally, or selectively, in different cancer cell-types and if it contributes to its pleiotropy. Considering the suggested DNA repair role of nuclear NDRG1, the effects of the above post-translational modifications on its nuclear localization was examined. Herein, the full-length (FL) and truncated (T) NDRG1 isoforms were detected using a C-terminus-directed antibody, while only the FL isoform was identified using an N-terminus-directed antibody. For the first time, we demonstrate that the expression of the NDRG1 FL and T forms occurs in all cancer cell-types examined, as does its phosphorylation (p-NDRG1) at Ser330 and Thr346. The FL isoform localized highly in the nucleus compared to the T isoform. Moreover, p-NDRG1 (Ser330) was also markedly localized in the nucleus, while p-NDRG1 (Thr346) was predominantly cytoplasmic in all cell-types. These results indicate the N-terminus region and phosphorylation at Ser330 could be crucial for NDRG1 nuclear localization and function. PTEN silencing indicated that p-NDRG1 (Thr346) could be regulated differentially in different tumor cell-types, indicating PTEN may be involved in the mechanism(s) underlying the pleiotropic activity of NDRG1. Finally, therapeutics of the di-2-pyridylketone thiosemicarbazone class increased nuclear NDRG1 isoforms (FL and T) detected by the C-terminus-directed antibody in HepG2 cells, while having no significant effect in PC3 cells, indicating differential activity depending on the cell-type.""","""['Kyung Chan Park', 'Sharleen V Menezes', 'Danuta S Kalinowski', 'Sumit Sahni', 'Patric J Jansson', 'Zaklina Kovacevic', 'Des R Richardson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis""","""['Targeting the Metastasis Suppressor, N-Myc Downstream Regulated Gene-1, with Novel Di-2-Pyridylketone Thiosemicarbazones: Suppression of Tumor Cell Migration and Cell-Collagen Adhesion by Inhibiting Focal Adhesion Kinase/Paxillin Signaling.', 'The iron-regulated metastasis suppressor NDRG1 targets NEDD4L, PTEN, and SMAD4 and inhibits the PI3K and Ras signaling pathways.', 'Dp44mT targets the AKT, TGF-β and ERK pathways via the metastasis suppressor NDRG1 in normal prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular functions of the iron-regulated metastasis suppressor, NDRG1, and its potential as a molecular target for cancer therapy.', 'Pharmacological targeting and the diverse functions of the metastasis suppressor, NDRG1, in cancer.', 'mTORC2-NDRG1-CDC42 axis couples fasting to mitochondrial fission.', 'Effects of imeglimin on mitochondrial function, AMPK activity, and gene expression in hepatocytes.', 'TGFβ Governs the Pleiotropic Activity of NDRG1 in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Progression.', 'NDRG1 in Cancer: A Suppressor, Promoter, or Both?', 'Novel iron chelator SK4 demonstrates cytotoxicity in a range of tumour derived cell lines.']"""

These findings suggest MAOA can be a potential target to treat PCa. For this reason, we identify and synthesize a near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) heptamethine dye–MAOA inhibitor conjugate (NIR-INH) for simultaneous PCa imaging, targeting and therapy. The conjugate combines a NIRF dye for mitochondria targeting with the MAOA inhibitor isoniazid (INH). NIR-INH exhibits specific targeting in PCa xenografts and markedly inhibited tumor growth.

Additional targeted fusion prostate biopsy was done of lesions with a PI-RADS™ (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) score of 3 or greater.  Results:   T1c prostate cancer was found in 372 of the 1,032 patients (36%). Of these cases 272 (73.1%) were classified as clinically significant prostate cancer. Saturation prostate biopsy vs targeted fusion prostate biopsy and a PI-RADS score of 3 or greater vs targeted fusion prostate biopsy and a PI-RADS score of 4 or greater diagnosed 95.6% vs 83.8% vs 60.3% of clinically significant prostate cancers (p <0.0001). Saturation prostate biopsy missed 12 of 272 clinically significant prostate cancers (4.5%) vs 44 (16.2%) and 108 of 272 (39.7%) missed by targeted fusion prostate biopsy and a PI-RADS score of 3 or greater and a score of 4 or greater, respectively (p <0.0001). As a triage test multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging would have spared 49.3% vs 73.6% of patients using a PI-RADS cutoff of 3 or greater vs 4 or greater.  Conclusions:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging could significantly reduce the number of unnecessary repeat prostate biopsies in about 50% of cases in which a PI-RADS score of 3 or greater is used. At the same time patients should be informed of the 16.2% and 39.7% false-negative rates of clinically significant prostate cancer for targeted fusion prostate biopsy of PI-RADS 3 or greater and 4 or greater lesions, respectively.""","""['Pietro Pepe', 'Antonio Garufi', 'Gian Domenico Priolo', 'Antonio Galia', 'Filippo Fraggetta', 'Michele Pennisi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Comparative analysis of transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy versus magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion guidance.', 'Validation of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Fusion Guided Targeted Biopsy Evaluated by Transperineal Template Saturation Prostate Biopsy for the Detection and Characterization of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'PI-RADS Steering Committee: The PI-RADS Multiparametric MRI and MRI-directed Biopsy Pathway.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Which SUVmax Value?', 'Transrectal ultrasound examination of prostate cancer guided by fusion imaging of multiparametric MRI and TRUS: avoiding unnecessary mpMRI-guided targeted biopsy.', 'Pathological characteristics and predictive factors of prostate biopsy in patients with serum PSA levels between 0 and 4.0 ng/ml.', 'Could 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Evaluation Reduce the Number of Scheduled Prostate Biopsies in Men Enrolled in Active Surveillance Protocols?', 'MRI/Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion-Guided Targeted Biopsy and Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Systematic Biopsy for Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

Prior reports have shown improved cancer detection with MRI-Bx vs transrectal ultrasound-guided methods (transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy [TRUS-Bx]). Population-based trends of their use and outcomes have not been previously characterized.  Materials and methods:   Using private insurance claims (2009-2015), we identified men who underwent prostate biopsy. Exposures were biopsy year and geographic region defined by metropolitan statistical area. Outcomes included biopsy type (MRI-Bx, TRUS-Bx, or transperineal biopsy) based on procedure codes and cancer detection based on a new diagnosis for prostate cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] 185). Hierarchical mixed-effects multivariable regression estimated odds of undergoing MRI-Bx.  Results:   We identified 241,681 men (mean age 57.5 ± 5.4 years) who underwent biopsy. The use of MRI-Bx rose rapidly (0.2% in 2009 to 6.5% in 2015, P <.001). Overall, 3429 men underwent MRI before biopsy, more commonly in metropolitan statistical areas (odds ratio 1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.66-2.19). In 2015, nearly 18% of men with prior negative biopsy underwent a prebiopsy MRI. Patients with prior negative biopsies were over 4 times more likely to use MRI guidance (vs no prior biopsies, odds ratio 4.63, 95% confidence interval 4.27-5.02) and had a greater chance of cancer detection with MRI-Bx (25.2%) vs TRUS-Bx (19.7%, P = .010).  Conclusion:   Among men undergoing prostate biopsy, prebiopsy prostate MRI utilization was concentrated within urban areas and among patients with prior negative biopsies, where its use was associated with superior cancer detection compared with traditional TRUS-Bx.""","""['Wen Liu', 'Dattatraya Patil', 'David H Howard', 'Renee H Moore', 'Heqiong Wang', 'Martin G Sanda', 'Christopher P Filson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Impact of prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate on cancer detection and treatment patterns.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Early experience with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsies under visual transrectal ultrasound guidance in patients suspicious for prostate cancer undergoing repeated biopsy.', 'A Prospective Comparison of Selective Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion-Targeted and Systematic Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Biopsies for Detecting Prostate Cancer in Men Undergoing Repeated Biopsies.', 'Three-dimensional convolutional neural network model to identify clinically significant prostate cancer in transrectal ultrasound videos: a prospective, multi-institutional, diagnostic study.', 'Safety profile of robotic-assisted transperineal MRI-US-fusion guided biopsy of the prostate.', 'Pooled outcomes of performing freehand transperineal prostate biopsy with the PrecisionPoint Transperineal Access System.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Bridging the gap between prostate radiology and pathology through machine learning.']"""

Acetylation of KLF5 at lysine 369 (K369) reverses its function from promoting to suppressing cell proliferation and tumor growth. In this study, we examined the regulation of KLF5 by histone deacetylases in the prostate cancer cell line DU 145. While confirming the functions of HDAC1/2 in KLF5 deacetylation and the promotion of cell proliferation, we found that the knockdown of HDAC1/2 upregulated KLF5 protein but not KLF5 mRNA, and the increase in KLF5 protein level by silencing HDAC1/2 was at least in part due to decreased proteasomal degradation. Deacetylase activity was required for HDAC1/2-mediated KLF5 degradation, and mutation of KLF5 to an acetylation-mimicking form prevented its degradation, even though the mutation did not affect the binding of KLF5 with HDAC1/2. Mutation of K369 to arginine, which prevents acetylation, did not affect the binding of KLF5 to HDAC1 or the response of KLF5 to HDAC1/2-promoted degradation. These findings provide a novel mechanistic association between the acetylation status of KLF5 and its protein stability. They also suggest that maintaining KLF5 in a deacetylated form may be an important mechanism by which KLF5 and HDACs promote cell proliferation and tumor growth.""","""['Ran Tao', 'Baotong Zhang', 'Yixiang Li', 'Jamie L King', 'Ruoyu Tian', 'Siyuan Xia', 'Cara Rae Schiavon', 'Jin-Tang Dong']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDACi) Promote KLF5 Ubiquitination and Degradation in Basal-like Breast Cancer.', 'Damaged DNA-binding protein down-regulates epigenetic mark H3K56Ac through histone deacetylase 1 and 2.', 'The deacetylase HDAC1 negatively regulates the cardiovascular transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 5 through direct interaction.', 'The physiological roles of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 2: complex co-stars with multiple leading parts.', 'Histone deacetylases 1 and 2 regulate DNA replication and DNA repair: potential targets for genome stability-mechanism-based therapeutics for a subset of cancers.', 'KLF5 and p53 comprise an incoherent feed-forward loop directing cell-fate decisions following stress.', 'KLF5 inhibition potentiates anti-PD1 efficacy by enhancing CD8+ T-cell-dependent antitumor immunity.', 'New insights into KLFs and SOXs in cancer pathogenesis, stemness, and therapy.', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDACi) Promote KLF5 Ubiquitination and Degradation in Basal-like Breast Cancer.', 'The Partial Role of KLF4 and KLF5 in Gastrointestinal Tumors.']"""

Liquid biopsies provide noninvasive prognostic markers such as circulating tumor DNA and RNA. Circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA) in blood is also used to identify mutations in genes of interest, but additionally, provides information about relative expression levels of important genes. In this study, we analyzed PD-L1 expression in ctRNA isolated from various cancer types. Tumors inhibit antitumor response by modulating the immune checkpoint proteins programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its cognate receptor PD1. The expression of these genes has been implicated in evasion of immune response and resistance to targeted therapies.  Methods:   Blood samples were collected from gastric (GC), colorectal (CRC), lung (NSCLC), breast (BC), prostate cancer (PC) patients, and a healthy control group. ctRNA was purified from fractionated plasma, and following reverse transcription, levels of PD-L1 expression were analyzed using qPCR.  Results:   PD-L1 expression was detected in the plasma ctRNA of all cancer types at varying frequencies but no PD-L1 mRNA was detected in cancer-free individuals. The frequencies of PD-L1 expression were significantly different among the various cancer types but the median relative PD-L1 expression values were not significantly different. In 12 cases where plasma and tumor tissue were available from the same patients, there was a high degree of concordance between expression of PD-L1 protein in tumor tissues and PD-L1 gene expression in plasma, and both methods were equally predictive of response to nivolumab.  Conclusions:   PD-L1 mRNA can be detected and quantitated in ctRNA of cancer patients. These results pave the way for further studies aimed at determining whether monitoring the levels of PD-L1 mRNA in blood can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from the conventional treatment.""","""['Toshiyuki Ishiba', 'Andreas-Claudius Hoffmann', 'Joshua Usher', 'Yahya Elshimali', 'Todd Sturdevant', 'Mai Dang', 'Yolanda Jaimes', 'Rama Tyagi', 'Ronald Gonzales', 'Mary Grino', 'Jacek K Pinski', 'Afsaneh Barzi', 'Luis E Raez', 'Wilfried E Eberhardt', 'Dirk Theegarten', 'Heinz-Josef Lenz', 'Hiroyuki Uetake', 'Peter V Danenberg', 'Kathleen Danenberg']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Comparison of PD-L1 mRNA Expression Measured with the CheckPoint Typer® Assay with PD-L1 Protein Expression Assessed with Immunohistochemistry in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Evaluation of the programmed death-ligand 1 mRNA expression and immunopositivity and their correlation with survival outcomes in Indian lung cancer patients.', 'Programmed death-ligand 1 is a promising blood marker for predicting tumor progression and prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.', 'Regulation of programmed death-ligand 1 expression in response to DNA damage in cancer cells: Implications for precision medicine.', 'Blood-based PD-L1 analysis in tumor-derived extracellular vesicles: Applications for optimal use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 axis inhibitors.', 'Network approach in liquidomics landscape.', 'Liquid Biopsy in Lung Cancer: Biomarkers for the Management of Recurrence and Metastasis.', 'Sequence-Based Platforms for Discovering Biomarkers in Liquid Biopsy of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Enhancing clinical potential of liquid biopsy through a multi-omic approach: A systematic review.', 'Leukocyte Telomeric G-Tail Length Shortening Is Associated with Esophageal Cancer Recurrence.']"""

Method:   Patients treated with abdominoperineal excision in 2007-2009 were identified using the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry. All consenting patients received a questionnaire. A sample of the Swedish population was contacted and completed a questionnaire. Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy in a prospective multicentre trial received questionnaires 24 months after surgery.

Because of time constraints and other patient health priorities, health care providers often do not discuss benefits and risks associated with cancer screening. We analyzed the association between seeking information online about breast and prostate cancer and undergoing mammography and PSA screening.  Methods:   We assessed guideline concordance in mammogram and PSA screening, according to USPSTF guidelines for those at average risk for disease. We used data on 4,537 survey respondents from the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) for 2012 through 2014 to assess online information-seeking, defined as whether people searched for cancer-related information online in the past 12 months. We used HINTS data to construct multivariable logistic regression models to isolate the effect of exposure to online information on the incidence of cancer screening.  Results:   After controlling for available covariates, we found no significant association between online information-seeking and guideline-concordant screening for breast or prostate cancer. Significant covariate values suggest that factors related to access to care were significantly associated with conformance to mammography guidelines for women recommended for screening and that physician discussion was significantly associated with nonconformance to guidelines for prostate-specific antigen screening (ie, having a PSA test in spite of the recommendation not to have it). Decomposition of differences between those who sought online information and those who did not indicated that uncontrolled confounders probably had little effect on findings.

In this study, we compared the ability of the CCP score and the expression of PTEN or Ki-67 to predict BCR in a cohort of patients treated by RP. Finally, we constructed the best predictive model for BCR, incorporating biomarkers and relevant clinical variables.  Materials and methods:   The study population consisted of 652 PCa patients enrolled in a retrospective cohort and who had RP surgery in French urological centers from 2000 to 2007.  Results:   Among the 652 patients with CCP scores and complete clinical data, BCR events occurred in 41%, and the median time from surgery to the last follow-up among BCR-free patients was 72 months. In univariate Cox analysis, the continuous CCP score and positive Ki-67 predicted recurrence with a HR of 1.44 (95% CI 1.17-1.75; p = 5.3 × 10-4) and 1.89 (95% CI 1.38-2.57; p = 1.6 × 10-4), respectively.

In fact, it is frequently observed that cells incur more damage at low dose (say 0.3 Gy) than at higher dose (say 1 Gy). This effect has been termed hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS). The effect depends on the type of cells and on their phase in the cell cycle when radiation is applied. Experiments have shown that the G2-checkpoint plays an important role in the HRS effects. Here we design and analyze a differential equation model for the cell cycle that includes G2-checkpoint dynamics and radiation treatment. We fit the model to surviving fraction data for different cell lines including glioma cells, prostate cancer cells, as well as to cell populations that are enriched in certain phases of the cell cycle. The HRS effect is measured in the literature through [Formula: see text], the ratio of slope [Formula: see text] of the surviving fraction curve at zero dose to slope [Formula: see text] of the corresponding LQ model. We derive an explicit formula for this ratio and we show that it corresponds very closely to experimental observations. Finally, we identify the dependence of this ratio on the surviving fraction at 2 Gy. It was speculated in the literature that such dependence exists.

Our results show that KLK12 efficiently cleaved the human extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and tenascin, both of which are involved in the regulation of endothelial cell adhesion and migration. For fibronectin, the major proteolytic product generated by KLK12 was a 29 kDa fragment containing the amino-terminal domain and the first five type I fibronectin-domains, which are essential for regulating fibronectin assembly. We also demonstrated that KLK12-mediated fibronectin proteolysis antagonizes fibronectin polymerization and fibronectin fibril formation by endothelial cells, leading to an increase in cell migration. Furthermore, a polyclonal antibody raised against KLK12's proteolytic cleavage site on fibronectin prevented the KLK12-dependent inhibition of fibronectin polymerization and the KLK12-mediated pro-migratory effect on endothelial cells.

Currently, there are no strategies to support active surveillance compliance nor are there interventions that can prevent or slow disease progression, ultimately delaying transition to active treatment before it is clinically required. Recently, we proposed that exercise may have a therapeutic potential in delaying the need for active treatment in men on active surveillance.  Methods and analysis:   A single-blinded, two arm, multicentre randomised controlled trial will be undertaken with 168 patients randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to exercise or usual care. Exercise will consist of supervised resistance and aerobic exercise performed three times per week for the first 6 months in an exercise clinical setting, and during months 7-12, a progressive stepped down approach will be used with men transitioning to once a week supervised training. Thereafter, for months 13 to 36, the men will self-manage their exercise programme. The primary endpoint will be the time until the patients begin active therapy. Secondary endpoints include disease progression (prostate specific antigen), body composition and muscle density, quality of life, distress and anxiety and an economic analysis will be performed. Measurements will be undertaken at 6 and 12 months (postintervention) and at 24 and 36 months follow-up. The primary outcome (time to initiation of curative therapy) will be analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Outcomes measured repeatedly will be analysed using mixed effects models to examine between-group differences. Data will be analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.  Ethics and dissemination:   Outcomes from the study will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and presented in scientific, consumer and clinical meetings.""","""['Daniel A Galvão', 'Dickon Hayne', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Suzanne K Chambers', 'Dennis R Taaffe', 'Nigel Spry', 'Paul A Scuffham', 'Robert S Ware', 'Nicolas H Hart', 'Robert U Newton']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Can exercise suppress tumour growth in advanced prostate cancer patients with sclerotic bone metastases?

The co-treatment-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent and accompanied by the down-regulation of Bcl-2 family members. Our data also indicated that co-treatment of metformin and quercetin strongly inhibited the VEGF/Akt/PI3K pathway. Moreover, these two agents acted synergistically to repress the growth of human prostate cancer cell xenograft in vivo in nude mice. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the combination therapy of metformin and quercetin exerted synergistic antitumor effects in prostate cancers via inhibition of VEGF/Akt/PI3K pathway.

Traditionally, this Ca2+ release was associated with the ER Ca2+ release channels, inositol 1,4,5‑triphosphate receptor (IP3R) and ryanodine receptor (RyR). Lately, however, other calcium conductances have been found to be intracellularly localized and to participate in cell fate regulation. Nonetheless, molecular identity and functional properties of the ER Ca2+ release mechanisms associated with multiple diseases, e.g. prostate cancer, remain unknown. Here we identify a new family of transient receptor potential melastatine 8 (TRPM8) channel isoforms as functional ER Ca2+ release channels expressed in mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). These TRPM8 isoforms exhibit an unconventional structure with 4 transmembrane domains (TMs) instead of 6 TMs characteristic of the TRP channel archetype. We show that these 4TM-TRPM8 isoforms form functional channels in the ER and participate in regulation of the steady-state Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) in mitochondria and the ER.

In the present investigation, through tissue microarray analysis, we report higher levels of folate receptor expression in prostate cancer (PCa) tissue derived from patients, which were minimal in normal tissue. For folate-receptor based targeted therapy of PCa, we generated novel planetary ball milled (PBM) nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with resveratrol (RES), and in combination with docetaxel (DTX) and conjugated with folic acid (FA) on the surface. The cytotoxic effect of FA-conjugated DTX-nanoparticles was found effectual that reduced the concentration of free drug (DTX) to 28 times. Flow cytometry analysis showed a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells by 30.92% and 65.9% in the FA-conjugated RES and in combination with DTX nanoparticle formulation respectively. However, only 8.9% apoptotic cells were found with control (empty NP). The expressions of NF-kB p65, COX-2, pro (BAX, BAK) and anti-apoptotic (BCL-2, BCL-XL) genes were significantly reduced after treatment with FA-RES + DTX-NP. In addition, the FA-conjugated DTX formulation exhibited additional cytotoxic effects with the down-regulation of survivin and an increased expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 in PCa cells. Further, we observed that treating DTX resistant PCa cells with FA-RES + DTX-NP exhibited a reversal of the ABC-transporter markers thereby limiting the multidrug resistance phenotype of the cancer cells.

In this prospective pilot study, we assessed the ability of 18F-misonidazole (18F-MISO) positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect hypoxia in high-grade PCa patients who were candidates for curative radiation therapy, and we evaluated 18F-MISO PET-MRI modulation after 3 months of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (nADT).  Methods and materials:   Eleven PCa patients with a Gleason score (GS) ≥ 8 underwent 18F-fluorocholine (18F-FCH) PET-computed tomography at diagnosis and an 18F-MISO hybrid PET-MRI examination before nADT; a second 18F-MISO PET-MRI examination was acquired after 3 months of nADT for all patients but one who dropped out because of noncompliance with nADT. Immunohistochemistry for tissue hypoxia- and proliferation-related biomarkers (glucose transporter 1, carbonic anhydrase IX, vascular endothelial growth factor A, Ki-67, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha, and epidermal growth factor receptor) was performed in lesions bearing the highest GS. We used nonparametric tests to assess (1) the presence of 18F-MISO-positive regions (tumor-to-background ratio [TBR] ≥ 1.4) at baseline; (2) the correlation between imaging parameters (PET tracer uptake, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PIRADS] scores, and dynamic contrast enhancement perfusion markers) at baseline; (3) the difference in immunohistochemistry staining between 18F-MISO-positive and -negative lesions; and (4) the changes in 18F-MISO PET-MRI after nADT.  Results:   Uptake of 18F-MISO was significant in 7 patients, being coincidental with the highest GS region in 5 of them. A significant correlation was found at baseline between GS and 18F-MISO TBR, between 18F-MISO TBR and MRI perfusion markers, between GS and 18F-FCH maximum standardized uptake value, between GS and PIRADS score, and between 18F-FCH maximum standardized uptake value and PIRADS score. No difference was found between 18F-MISO-positive and -negative biopsy specimens with respect to tissue biomarkers. The TBR of 18F-MISO diminished significantly after nADT only in high-grade lesions and in regions with a significant uptake at baseline.  Conclusions:   PET imaging with 18F-MISO showed variable uptake in PCa, associated with a higher GS, lowering significantly after 3 months of nADT in high-grade lesions.

Therefore, inhibition of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis can be an efficient therapeutic approach for cancer chemoprevention in drug development studies. It is also determined that anti-inflammatory drugs reduce cancer incidence. Cell culture-based in vitro screening methods are used as a fast and efficient method to investigate the biological activities of the biomolecules. In addition, saponins are molecules that are isolated from natural sources and are known to have potential for tumor inhibition. Studies on the preparation of analogues of cycloartane-type sapogenols (9,19-cyclolanostanes) have so far been limited. Therefore we have decided to direct our efforts toward the exploration of new anti-tumor agents prepared from cycloastragenol and its production artifact astragenol. The semi-synthetic derivatives were prepared mainly by oxidation, condensation, alkylation, acylation, and elimination reactions. After preliminary studies, five sapogenol analogues, two of which were new compounds (2 and 3), were selected and screened for their inhibitory activity on cell viability and NFκB signaling pathway activity in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. We found that the astragenol derivatives 1 and 2 as well as cycloastragenol derivatives 3, 4, and 5 exhibited strong inhibitory activity on NFκB signaling leading the repression of NFκB transcriptional activation and suppressed cell proliferation.

We found that β-arrestin1 could promote the cell and tumor growth of prostate cancer, and β-arrestin1 expression represented a negative correlation with FOXO3a expression but not FOXO1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. In addition, forced expression of β-arrestin1 induced a significant decrease of FOXO3a expression but had no clear effect on FOXO1 expression. Mechanistically, β-arrestin1 could interact with FOXO3a and MDM2, respectively, and promote the interaction between FOXO3a and MDM2, whereas it had no obvious interaction with FOXO1. Furthermore, β-arrestin1 could inhibit the transcriptional activity of FOXO3a via Akt and ERK1/2 pathways.

This study compared the quality of life (QoL) of men with advanced prostate cancer who had BTO to those who had BSO, with an emphasis on their perception of self or identity as a man.  Subjects and methods:   Sixty-one patients with advanced prostate cancer opting for bilateral orchiectomy were recruited. Pre-orchiectomy and at 1 month and 3 months post-orchiectomy, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Prostate cancer (FACT-P) questionnaires were administered and scored.  Results:   Thirty (49.18%) patients had BTO (BTO group), while 31 (50.82%) patients had BSO (BSO group) for advanced prostate cancer. On comparison of the two groups, there were no statistically significant differences in FACT-P scores at 1 month and 3 months. The subscale scores also showed no significant statistical difference except for the physical well-being score at 3 months post-orchiectomy, which was lower in the BSO group (P = 0.041). The average scores of Item P5 (I am able to feel like a man) which were used to assess the sex-role identity declined on an average over 3 months with no statistically significant difference on comparison of the two groups.  Conclusion:   The QoL scores (FACT-P and FACT-G) assessed over 3 months post-orchiectomy did not differ on comparison of the BTO group and the BSO group.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analysed data from 561 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between February 2014 and October 2015. To develop a side-specific predictive model, we considered the prostatic lobes separately. Four variables were included: prostate-specific antigen; highest ipsilateral biopsy Gleason grade; highest ipsilateral percentage core involvement; and ECE on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to predict side-specific ECE. A nomogram was built based on the coefficients of the logit function. Internal validation was performed using 'leave-one-out' cross-validation. Calibration was graphically investigated. The decision curve analysis was used to evaluate the net clinical benefit.  Results:   The study population consisted of 829 side-specific cases, after excluding negative biopsy observations (n = 293). ECE was reported on mpMRI and final pathology in 115 (14%) and 142 (17.1%) cases, respectively. Among these, mpMRI was able to predict ECE correctly in 57 (40.1%) cases. All variables in the model except highest percentage core involvement were predictors of ECE (all P ≤ 0.006). All variables were considered for inclusion in the nomogram. After internal validation, the area under the curve was 82.11%. The model demonstrated excellent calibration and improved clinical risk prediction, especially when compared with relying on mpMRI prediction of ECE alone. When retrospectively applying the nomogram-derived probability, using a 20% threshold for performing nerve-sparing, nine out of 14 positive surgical margins (PSMs) at the site of ECE resulted above the threshold.  Conclusion:   We developed an easy-to-use model for the prediction of side-specific ECE, and hope it serves as a tool for planning nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy and in the reduction of PSM in future series.""","""['Alberto Martini', 'Akriti Gupta', 'Sara C Lewis', 'Shivaram Cumarasamy', 'Kenneth G Haines rd', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Ashutosh K Tewari']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['A novel nomogram for predicting ECE of prostate cancer.', 'A picture is worth a thousand words… but does it add utility to a nomogram to predict extraprostatic extension?', 'External validation of a novel side-specific, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-based nomogram for the prediction of extracapsular extension of prostate cancer: preliminary outcomes on a series diagnosed with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-targeted plus systematic saturation biopsy.', 'Novel nomogram for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion including multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'External Validation of a Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Nomogram for the Prediction of Extracapsular Extension and Seminal Vesicle Invasion in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'An updated approach to incremental nerve sparing for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Selection of patients for nerve sparing surgery in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Side-specific, Microultrasound-based Nomogram for the Prediction of Extracapsular Extension in Prostate Cancer.', 'Validation of user-friendly models predicting extracapsular extension in prostate cancer patients.', 'Predicting the probability of pT3 or higher pathological stage at radical prostatectomy: COVID19-specific considerations.', '3D-Reconstructed Contact Surface Area and Tumour Volume on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Improve the Prediction of Extraprostatic Extension of Prostate Cancer.', 'A side-specific nomogram for extraprostatic extension may reduce the positive surgical margin rate in radical prostatectomy.']"""

Several studies have demonstrated a decline in the number of medical graduates having examined cancer patients during their training. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure of medical students to cancer patients during clinical placements. Eighty-eight logbooks (response rate = 24.75%) containing 9430 patients were analysed. A total of 829 patients (8.79%) had a diagnosis of cancer. Most cancer patients were seen on surgical placements, whilst general practice placements returned the lowest numbers. None were seen in paediatrics or ophthalmology. Given the role surgery plays in the staging and treatment of cancer, it is unsurprising that most cancer patients were seen during surgery. Most concerning was the number of patients with common cancers seen by our students. Only 46% of students saw a patient with breast cancer. Even fewer saw patients with colorectal (41%), lung (32%) and prostate cancer (30%). Only 14% saw a melanoma patient. Variability in the quality of the logbooks is the main limitation of this study, and therefore, it is not a complete picture of cancer patient exposure. However, it builds upon previous studies by providing insight to the number and types of cancer patients to which students were exposed. Overall, the exposure to common cancers remains concerning and further research is needed to explore the type and quality of these interactions over the course of an entire year.""","""['Darren L Starmer']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Student Exposure to Cancer Patients: an Analysis of Clinical Logbooks and Focus Groups in Clinical Year Medical Students.', 'The impact of students and curriculum on self-study during clinical training in medical school: a multilevel approach.', 'Do senior medical students meet recommended emergency medicine curricula requirements?', 'Perceptions of preparedness for the first medical clerkship: a systematic review and synthesis.', 'A review of longitudinal community and hospital placements in medical education: BEME Guide No. 26.', 'A Hypothetical Approach on Gender Differences in Cancer Diagnosis.']"""

This study aimed to establish the functional role of STEAP2 in prostate tumourigenesis and evaluate if its knockdown resulted in reduced invasive potential of prostate cancer cells. PC3 and LNCaP cells were transfected with STEAP2 siRNA and proliferation, migration, invasion and gene expression analyses were performed. STEAP2 immunohistochemistry was applied to assess the protein expression and localisation according to Gleason score in 164 prostate cancer patients. Invasion significantly decreased in both cell lines following STEAP2 knockdown. PC3 proliferation and migration capacity significantly reduced, while LNCaP cell morphology and growth characteristics were altered. Additionally, STEAP2 downstream targets associated with driving invasion were identified as MMP3, MMP10, MMP13, FGFR4, IL1β, KiSS1 and SERPINE1 in PC3 cells and, MMP7 in LNCaP cells, with CD82 altered in both. In patient tissues, STEAP2 expression was significantly increased in prostate cancer samples and this significantly correlated with Gleason score.

This prospective study investigates the association between dietary sugars (fructose and sucrose) and sugary foods and beverages in relation to combined and site-specific (breast, prostate, colorectal) adiposity-associated cancers.Methods: The analytic sample consisted of 3,184 adults, aged 26-84 years, from the Framingham Offspring cohort. Diet data were first collected between 1991 and 1995 using a food frequency questionnaire. Intakes of fructose, sucrose, sugary foods, and sugary beverages (fruit juice and sugar-sweetened beverages) were derived. Participants were followed up until 2013 to ascertain cancer incidence; 565 doctor-diagnosed adiposity-related cancers, including 124 breast, 157 prostate, and 68 colorectal cancers occurred. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations. Tests for interaction with BMI and waist circumference were conducted.Results: No associations were observed between fructose, sucrose, sugary food consumption, and combined incidence of adiposity-related cancers or the examined site-specific cancers. While total consumption of sugary beverages was not associated with site-specific cancer risk, higher intakes of fruit juice were associated with 58% increased prostate cancer risk (HR: 1.58; 95% CI, 1.04-2.41) in multivariable-adjusted models. In exploratory stratified analyses, higher sugary beverage intakes increased overall adiposity-related cancer risk by 59% in participants with excessive central adiposity (HR: 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.50; Ptrend = 0.057).Conclusions: In this cohort of American adults, higher sugary beverage consumption was associated with increased cancer risk among participants with central adiposity.Impact: These analyses suggest that avoiding sugary beverages represents a simple dietary modification that may be used as an effective cancer control strategy.

Among them, the synthesis of computed tomography (CT) image from T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) image is of great importance, although the mapping between them is highly complex due to large gaps of appearances of the two modalities. In this work, we aim to tackle this MR-to-CT synthesis task by a novel deep embedding convolutional neural network (DECNN). Specifically, we generate the feature maps from MR images, and then transform these feature maps forward through convolutional layers in the network. We can further compute a tentative CT synthesis from the midway of the flow of feature maps, and then embed this tentative CT synthesis result back to the feature maps. This embedding operation results in better feature maps, which are further transformed forward in DECNN.

Main methods:   Cytotoxicity of 4-FTSC in PC-3 cells was evaluated using MTT assay. Morphology examination of PC-3 cells treated with 4-FTSC was also performed as well as the cell death mechanisms induced were investigated using flow cytometry. Parameters of toxicity of 4-FTSC was conducted by the investigation of its potential myelotoxicity and lymphotoxicity, hemolytic activity and acute oral toxicity profile.  Key findings:   4-FTSC showed promising cytotoxic effects against PC-3 cells (IC50 = 18.46 μM). It also triggered apoptotic morphological changes, phosphatidylserine externalization and a significant increase of DNA fragmentation in PC-3 cells. Moreover, 4-FTSC did not show changes in the PC-3 cell cycle with levels of p21, p27, NFĸB and cyclin D1 similar to those found in both control and treated cells. 4-FTSC also promoted an increase of p53 levels associated with mitochondrial impairment through loss of ∆Ψm and ROS overproduction. 4-FTSC-induced cell death mechanism in PC-3 cells involved activation of caspase-3/-7 through apoptosis intrinsic pathway via caspase-9. Regarding toxicological profile, 4-FTSC showed in vitro lymphotoxicity, although with low cytotoxicity for bone marrow progenitors and no hemolytic potential. Moreover, it was classified as GHS category 5 (LD50 > 2000-5000 mg/Kg), suggesting it has low acute oral systemic toxicity.  Significance:   4-FTSC seems to be a promising candidate to be used as a clinical tool in prostate cancer treatment.

Recently, the HSD3B1 (1245C) variant was shown to predict shorter duration of response to androgen deprivation therapy with medical or surgical castration in the setting of castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC). The HSD3B1 (1245C) variant also predicts longer duration of response to ketoconazole in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We hypothesized that the HSD3B1 (1245C) variant predicts response to treatment with abiraterone acetate (AA) and can help personalize treatment in men with advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   Clinical data and samples were from a prospectively maintained prostate cancer registry at the University of Utah. Genotyping was performed. The primary study end point was progression-free survival in first-line AA in men with metastatic CRPC. We performed prespecified multivariate analyses to assess the independent predictive value of HSD3B1 genotype on progression-free survival on AA.  Results:   Seventy-six men with metastatic CRPC treated with first-line AA were included. In multivariate analysis, the HSD3B1 (1245C) variant did not predict response to first-line AA.  Conclusion:   The HSD3B1 (1245C) variant does not predict response to first-line AA in metastatic CRPC. This finding could be due to the ability of AA metabolites to act as both agonist (3-keto-5α-abiraterone) and antagonist (Δ4-abiraterone) on androgen signaling.""","""['Andrew W Hahn', 'David M Gill', 'Roberto H Nussenzveig', 'Austin Poole', 'Jim Farnham', 'Lisa Cannon-Albright', 'Neeraj Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['HSD3B1 and Response to a Nonsteroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitor in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Treatment with abiraterone and enzalutamide does not overcome poor outcome from metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in men with the germline homozygous HSD3B1 c.1245C genotype.', 'HSD3B1(1245A>C) variant regulates dueling abiraterone metabolite effects in prostate cancer.', 'Germline HSD3B1 Genetics and Prostate Cancer Outcomes.', 'HSD3B1 status as a biomarker of androgen deprivation resistance and implications for prostate cancer.', 'Adrenal Steroids and Resistance to Hormonal Blockade of Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Management of prostate cancer by targeting 3βHSD1 after enzalutamide and abiraterone treatment.', 'Circulating and Intratumoral Adrenal Androgens Correlate with Response to Abiraterone in Men with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Gene polymorphism-related differences in the outcomes of abiraterone for prostate cancer: a systematic overview.', 'Genetic Polymorphisms and Pharmacotherapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, there is uncertain application to active surveillance. We quantified the rate of adverse surgical pathology and implications for survival in patients at favorable intermediate risk compared to those with low risk prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We performed a comparative cohort study of men with prostate cancer from 2009 to 2013 in the National Cancer Database who underwent radical prostatectomy. The study primary end point was adverse pathology, defined as Grade Group 3 or greater/pT3b/pN1. Various favorable intermediate risk definitions were evaluated, including the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center definition of Grade Group 2 or less with only 1 intermediate risk factor (Grade Group 2/cT2b/prostate specific antigen 10 to 20 ng/ml), which we defined as type 1 intermediate risk. The remaining patients at intermediate risk were classified as type 2 intermediate risk. Log binomial, logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied.  Results:   Adverse pathological findings were noted in 3,519 of the 51,688 patients (6.8%) at low risk and 8,888 of the 42,720 Grade Group 2 patients (20.8%) at intermediate risk (RR 3.06, 95% CI 2.95-3.17, p <0.001). Stratification by prostate specific antigen and volume minimally impacted the absolute rate. Results were similar for the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center definition (type 1 intermediate risk). Type 2 intermediate risk led to a greater risk of adverse pathology (RR 8.52, 8.23-8.82, p <0.001) and Grade Group 1 intermediate risk led to lower risk (RR 2.00, 1.86-2.16, p <0.001). Patients at favorable intermediate risk had worse overall survival than patients at low risk in adjusted models due to adverse pathology.  Conclusions:   Adverse pathology at radical prostatectomy was observed at a threefold higher rate in patients classified at favorable intermediate risk compared to low risk, leading to worse overall survival. Men at intermediate risk may be better classified as types 1 and 2 since none showed pathological outcomes similar to those of men at low risk.""","""['Hiten D Patel', 'Mohit Gupta', 'Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Alan W Partin', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network® Favorable Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer-Is Active Surveillance Appropriate?', 'Comparison of Pathological and Oncologic Outcomes of Favorable Risk Gleason Score 3 + 4 and Low Risk Gleason Score 6 Prostate Cancer: Considerations for Active Surveillance.', 'Defining Prostate Cancer at Favorable Intermediate Risk: The Potential Utility of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Genomic Tests.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Prostatectomy pathology findings in an active surveillance population.', 'Long-term and pathological outcomes of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: implications for active surveillance.', 'Advances in the selection of patients with prostate cancer for active surveillance.', 'No detrimental effect of a positive family history on postoperative upgrading and upstaging in men with low risk and favourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer: implications for active surveillance.', 'The role of prostate-specific antigen density in men with low-risk prostate cancer suitable for active surveillance: results of a prospective observational study.']"""

To our knowledge its effect on the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition which frequently co-occurs with metabolic syndrome and other subsequent liver conditions such as liver cirrhosis, hepatic necrosis or any liver disease, has not been investigated.  Materials and methods:   We identified 82,938 men 66 years old or older who were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results)-Medicare database from 1992 to 2009. Men with preexisting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, liver disease, diabetes or metabolic syndrome were excluded from study. Propensity score adjusted, competing risk regression models were created to compare the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in men who were vs were not treated with androgen deprivation. We also explored the influence of cumulative exposure to androgen deprivation therapy, calculated as monthly equivalent doses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists/antagonists (fewer than 7, 7 to 11 or more than 11 doses).  Results:   Overall 37.5% of men underwent androgen deprivation therapy. They were more likely to be diagnosed with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.40-1.68), liver cirrhosis (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.12-1.60), liver necrosis (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.15-1.72) and any liver disease (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.35-1.60). A dose-response relationship was observed between the number of androgen deprivation therapy doses, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and any liver disease.

Results:   In younger subjects <65 years, concentrations of (6S)-5-CH3-H4folate (15.3 vs. 17.7 nmol/L) or total folate (UPLC-MS/MS) (18.7 vs. 23.0 nmol/L) did not differ between men with BPH and those with PCa, while SAM was higher in the controls (128 vs. 116 nmol/L). Younger patients with low- and high grade cancer did not differ in (6S)-5-CH3-H4folate (17.8 vs. 17.3 nmol/L) or total folate (UPLC-MS/MS) (22.9 vs. 23.3 nmol/L), but SAM was lower in patients with low grade PCa (111 vs. 126 nmol/L).

In this study, we investigated the role of 4-MU in mammary carcinoma cells with distinct malignant phenotypes and estrogen receptor (ER) status, a major prognostic factor in the clinical management of breast cancers. We focused on two breast cancer cell lines, the low metastatic and ERα+ MCF-7 cells, and the highly-aggressive and ERα- MDA-MB-231 cells. Treatment with 4-MU caused a dose-dependent decrease of hyaluronan accumulation in the extracellular matrix as well as within the breast cancer cells, most prevalent in cells lacking ERα. This decrease in hyaluronan was accompanied by suppression of Hyaluronan Synthase 2 (HAS2), the major enzyme responsible for the synthesis of hyaluronan, and by induction of hyaluronidases (HYALs) -1 and -2. Moreover, 4-MU induced intense phenotypic changes and substantial loss of CD44, a major hyaluronan receptor, from cell protrusions. Importantly, 4-MU evoked differential effects depending on the absence or presence of ERα. Only the ERα+ cells showed signs of apoptosis, as determined by cleaved PARP-1, and anoikis as shown by concurrent loss of E-cadherin and β-catenin. Interestingly, 4-MU significantly reduced migration, adhesion and invasion of ERα- breast cancer cells, and concurrently reduced the expression and activity of several matrix degrading enzymes and pro-inflammatory molecules with tumor-promoting functions. Collectively, our findings suggest that 4-MU could represent a novel therapeutic for specific breast cancer subtypes with regard to their ER status via suppression of hyaluronan synthesis and regulation of HAS2, CD44, matrix-degrading enzymes and inflammatory mediators.""","""['Theodoros T Karalis', 'Paraskevi Heldin', 'Demitrios H Vynios', 'Thomas Neill', 'Simone Buraschi', 'Renato V Iozzo', 'Nikos K Karamanos', 'Spyros S Skandalis']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Matrix Biol""","""['4-Methylumbelliferone Suppresses Hyaluronan Synthesis and Tumor Progression in SCID Mice Intra-abdominally Inoculated With Pancreatic Cancer Cells.', 'Inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis in breast cancer cells by 4-methylumbelliferone suppresses tumorigenicity in vitro and metastatic lesions of bone in vivo.', 'The action of hyaluronan in functional properties, morphology and expression of matrix effectors in mammary cancer cells depends on its molecular size.', 'HAS2 and CD44 in breast tumorigenesis.', 'Roles and targeting of the HAS/hyaluronan/CD44 molecular system in cancer.', 'Anoikis resistance--protagonists of breast cancer cells survive and metastasize after ECM detachment.', '4-Methylumbelliferone enhances the effects of chemotherapy on both temozolomide-sensitive and resistant glioblastoma cells.', 'Extracellular matrix remodeling in tumor progression and immune escape: from mechanisms to treatments.', 'Identification of a Small Molecule Inhibitor of Hyaluronan Synthesis, DDIT, Targeting Breast Cancer Cells.', 'The Extracellular Matrix: A Key Accomplice of Cancer Stem Cell Migration, Metastasis Formation, and Drug Resistance in PDAC.']"""

Indels are primarily detected from DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) data but their transcriptional consequences remain unexplored due to challenges in discriminating medium-sized and large indels from splicing events in RNA-seq data.  Results:   Here, we developed transIndel, a splice-aware algorithm that parses the chimeric alignments predicted by a short read aligner and reconstructs the mid-sized insertions and large deletions based on the linear alignments of split reads from DNA-seq or RNA-seq data. TransIndel exhibits competitive or superior performance over eight state-of-the-art indel detection tools on benchmarks using both synthetic and real DNA-seq data. Additionally, we applied transIndel to DNA-seq and RNA-seq datasets from 333 primary prostate cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 59 metastatic prostate cancer patients from AACR-PCF Stand-Up- To-Cancer (SU2C) studies. TransIndel enhanced the taxonomy of DNA- and RNA-level alterations in prostate cancer by identifying recurrent FOXA1 indels as well as exitron splicing in genes implicated in disease progression.  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrates that transIndel is a robust tool for elucidation of medium- and large-sized indels from DNA-seq and RNA-seq data.

Here, we conceive a dual mechanism of Par-4-mediated inhibition of EMT and induction of MET in metastatic pancreatic cancer cells. First, we demonstrate that 1,1'-β-D-glucopyranosyl-3,3'-bis(5-bromoindolyl)-octyl methane (NGD16), an N-glycosylated derivative of medicinally important phytochemical 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) abrogates EMT by inducing pro-apoptotic protein Par-4. Induction of Par-4 (by NGD16 or ectopic overexpression) strongly impedes invasion with inhibition of major mesenchymal markers viz. Vimentin and Twist-1 epithelial marker- E-cadherin. Further, NGD16 triggers MET phenotypes in pancreatic cancer cells by augmenting ALK2/Smad4 signaling in a Par-4-dependent manner. Conversely, siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous Par-4 unveil reversal of MET with diminished E-cadherin expression and invasive phenotypes. Additionally, we demonstrate that intact Smad4 is essential for Par-4-mediated maintenance of E-cadherin level in MET induced cells. Notably, we imply that Par-4 induction regulates E-cadherin levels in the pancreatic cancer cells via modulating Twist-1 promoter activity.

Although cytotoxic chemotherapy is of limited effectiveness, prospective clinical studies can hardly be conducted. Targeted therapeutic treatment approaches and potentially immunotherapy based on a biological rationale may provide an alternative strategy. We therefore subjected 70 urachal adenocarcinomas to targeted next-generation sequencing, conducted in situ and immunohistochemical analyses (including PD-L1 and DNA mismatch repair proteins [MMR]) and evaluated the microsatellite instability (MSI) status. The analytical findings were correlated with clinicopathological and outcome data and Kaplan-Meier and univariable/multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed. The patients had a mean age of 50 years, 66% were male and a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 58% and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of 45% was detected. Sequence variations were observed in TP53 (66%), KRAS (21%), BRAF (4%), PIK3CA (4%), FGFR1 (1%), MET (1%), NRAS (1%), and PDGFRA (1%). Gene amplifications were found in EGFR (5%), ERBB2 (2%), and MET (2%). We detected no evidence of MMR-deficiency (MMR-d)/MSI-high (MSI-h), whereas 10 of 63 cases (16%) expressed PD-L1. Therefore, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy approaches might be tested in UrC. Importantly, we found aberrations in intracellular signal transduction pathways (RAS/RAF/PI3K) in 31% of UrCs with potential implications for anti-EGFR therapy. Less frequent potentially actionable genetic alterations were additionally detected in ERBB2 (HER2), MET, FGFR1, and PDGFRA.

The MIL-38 monoclonal antibody is specific for the membrane glycoprotein glypican 1 (GPC-1) and binds to prostate cancer tissue. Urine is known to be a source of cellular material. Thus, we hypothesized that detection of GPC-1 in urine cellular material may identify individuals with prostate cancer. Urine samples from patients with prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or normal controls were collected and cell sediments prepared. GPC-1-positive cells were detected using a MIL-38 immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and samples were classed positive or negative for GPC-1 expressing cells. Assay sensitivity and specificity, stratified by PSA, was reported. A total of 125 patient samples were analyzed (N = 41 prostate cancer; N = 37 BPH; N = 47 normal controls). The use of MIL-38 to detect GPC-1 by IFA discriminated between prostate cancer and BPH urine specimens with a sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 76%, respectively. Assay specificity increased with increasing PSA, with the highest specificity (89%) for patients with PSA ≥4 ng/ml. At lower PSA (<2 ng/ml) specificity decreased, as evidenced by a greater number of false positives in this concentration range. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for GPC-1-positive cells in patients with prostate cancer, adjusted for PSA, was greatest at the lowest serum PSA (<2 ng/ml; OR = 13.4; 95% CI: 4.0-44.7) compared with no adjustment for PSA (OR = 6.4; 95% CI: 2.8-14.9).

Finding a solution to those problems is a challenging task which requires more advanced strategies like optimal control theory. In this work, we perform an optimal control analysis on a previously developed computational model for the testosterone effects of triptorelin in prostate cancer patients with the goal of finding optimal drug-release characteristics.

Recently, a number of new prostate cancer-associated lncRNAs has been listed via RNA-seq approach by Mitranscriptome project. By analyzing this data we chose four lncRNAs (Prcat17.3, Prcat38, Prcat47, and Cat2184.4) and evaluated their expressions and their abilities to discriminate prostate tumors from benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).  Methods:   Fresh Prostate tissue samples (30 BPH, and 30 tumor samples) and urine samples (19 BPH, and 19 tumor samples) were collected and their total RNA extracted for cDNA syntheses. The expression of candidate lncRNAs was assessed by the real-time PCR technique.  Results:   Our data revealed that the expression levels of PRCAT17.3 (P < 0.0001) and PRCAT38 (P < 0.0002) were significantly upregulated in human prostate cancer tissues, compared to BPH ones. Moreover, the altered expression was much higher for PRCAT17.3 (∼2000 folds) than PRCAT38 (∼50 folds). In contrast, the expression of Cat2184.4 showed a significant down-regulation in tumor samples (P < 0.0001), compared to BPH ones. While the expression level of PRCAT47 was increased in cancer samples, the changes were not statistically significant. In discriminating prostate tumors from BPH samples, Prcat17.3 (AUC-ROC, 0.927) demonstrated a better diagnostic efficacy than Prcat38 (AUC-ROC, 0.778). Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analyses on urine samples of prostate cancer patients revealed that prcat17.3 level is significantly elevated, (P < 0.0197; AUC-ROC value of 0.72), compared to that of BPH patients.

Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire in the 5-year follow-up survey.  Results:   Three major dietary patterns were derived using exploratory factors analysis: prudent, westernized, and traditional dietary patterns.

In preparation for the study, the current PSA testing practice in the Münster district was assessed.  Materials and methods:   The frequencies of early detection examinations, medically indicated PSA tests, and prostate biopsies in the Münster district were determined, using aggregated data from the regional association of Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) Physicians in Westfalen-Lippe. With anonymized laboratory data, the frequency of PSA tests in general and urological practices, and their distribution among the accounting categories SHI, individual health services, and invoices for privately insured patients were investigated.  Results:   In about half of more than 50,000 PSA tests, the accounting category could be determined; the rest could only be assigned to SHI or non-SHI services. The percentage of PSA tests that were performed due to reasons other than medically necessary SHI-reimbursed services was > 50% in each age group; it was highest in men younger than 55 years, and declined markedly with advanced age. More than half of the PSA tests that were likely due to opportunistic screening were performed outside the age group 55-69 years.  Conclusions:   The percentage of PSA tests that were not carried out as SHI services was > 80% in general practices, and 60% in urological practices. These percentages decreased markedly with advancing age.

Twenty-five patients (45%) received SBRT alone while the remaining 30 patients (55%) received concomitant ADT. Median follow-up was 24.6 months (range 3.0-67.2 months). No acute or late toxicity of grade > 1 was reported. Clinical progression was observed in 38 (69%) patients. 1-year biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS), clinical progression-free survival (c-PFS), prostate-specific survival (PCSS) and local control (LC) rates were 51, 56, 100 and 83%, respectively. Comparing patients treated with SBRT alone and with concomitant ADT, no significant differences were found for those outcomes. SBRT is safe and allows high 1-year LC rate (83%) with low toxicity profile.

The cascading failure model based on degree strength was applied to the logic network for three types of cancer including adenocarcinoma of lung, prostate cancer, and colon cancer based on their gene expression profiles. In order to highlight the differences between the three networks by the cascading failure mechanism, we used the largest-scale cascades and the cumulative cascade probability to depict the damage. It was found that the cascading failures caused by hubs are usually larger. Furthermore, the result shows that propagations against the networks were correlated with the structures motifs of connected logical doublets. Finally, some genes were selected based on cascading failure mechanism.

However, experimental evidence supporting its efficacy is lacking. Here, we investigated the anticancer properties and molecular mechanism of QLXZD in vitro in a human PCa cell line (PC3) and in vivo using PC3 xenografts in nude mice. We confirmed the antineoplastic activity of QLXZD by analyzing cell viability and tumor volume growth, which decreased significantly compared to that of the controls. Autophagy following QLXZD treatment was detected morphologically using transmission electron microscopy and was confirmed by measuring the expression of autophagy markers (LC3-II and p62) using fluorescence analysis, flow cytometry, and western blotting. Increasing autophagic flux induced by QLXZD was monitored via pmCherry-GFP-LC3 fluorescence analysis. QLXZD-induced autophagic cell death was alleviated by the autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyl adenine and hydroxychloroquine. We evaluated the total expression and phosphorylation levels of proteins involved in the Akt/mTOR pathway regulating autophagy. Phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K, but not total protein levels, decreased following treatment. This is the first study to demonstrate the autophagy-related mechanistic pathways utilized during QLXZD-mediated antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.

Standard treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) that also affects bone biology. Treatment options for patients relapsing after ADT are limited, particularly in cases where castration-resistance does not depend on androgen receptor (AR) activity. Patients with non-AR driven metastases may, however, benefit from therapies targeting the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, the current study specifically investigated bone cell activity in clinical bone metastases in relation to tumor cell AR activity, in order to gain novel insight into biological heterogeneities of possible importance for patient stratification into bone-targeting therapies. Metastasis tissue obtained from treatment-na&iuml;ve (n = 11) and castration-resistant (n = 28) patients was characterized using whole-genome expression analysis followed by multivariate modeling, functional enrichment analysis, and histological evaluation. Bone cell activity was analyzed by measuring expression levels of predefined marker genes representing osteoclasts (ACP5, CTSK, MMP9), osteoblasts (ALPL, BGLAP, RUNX2) and osteocytes (SOST). Principal component analysis indicated a positive correlation between osteoblast and osteoclast activity and a high variability in bone cell activity between different metastases. Immunohistochemistry verified a positive correlation between runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) positive osteoblasts and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP, encoded by ACP5) positive osteoclasts lining the metastatic bone surface. No difference in bone cell activity was seen between treatment-na&iuml;ve and castration-resistant patients. Importantly, bone cell activity was inversely correlated to tumor cell AR activity (measured as AR, FOXA1, HOXB13, KLK2, KLK3, NKX3-1, STEAP2, and TMPRSS2 expression) and to patient serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Functional enrichment analysis indicated high bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in metastases with high bone cell activity and low tumor cell AR activity. This was confirmed by BMP4 immunoreactivity in tumor cells of metastases with ongoing bone formation, as determined by histological evaluation of van Gieson-stained sections. In conclusion, the inverse relation observed between bone cell activity and tumor cell AR activity in prostate cancer bone metastasis may be of importance for patient response to AR and/or bone targeting therapies, but needs to be evaluated in clinical settings in relation to serum markers for bone remodeling, radiography and patient response to therapy. The importance of BMP signaling in the development of sclerotic metastasis lesions deserves further exploration.""","""['Annika Nordstrand', 'Erik Bovinder Ylitalo', 'Elin Thysell', 'Emma Jernberg', 'Sead Crnalic', 'Anders Widmark', 'Anders Bergh', 'Ulf H Lerner', 'Pernilla Wikström']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Subgroups of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases Defined Through an Inverse Relationship Between Androgen Receptor Activity and Immune Response.', 'A novel DNA methylation signature is associated with androgen receptor activity and patient prognosis in bone metastatic prostate cancer.', 'A new murine model of osteoblastic/osteolytic lesions from human androgen-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Bone-targeting agents in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases biology and clinical management (Review).', 'Endothelial-to-osteoblast transition in normal mouse bone development.', 'Epithelial and Stromal Characteristics of Primary Tumors Predict the Bone Metastatic Subtype of Prostate Cancer and Patient Survival after Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Osteoclasts directly influence castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor Activation Reduces Metastatic Prostate Cancer Bone Lesions by Blocking the Endothelial-to-Osteoblast Transition.']"""

Here, we report that YAP induces leukocyte-specific integrin β2 (ITGB2) expression in cancer cells, thereby promoting cell invasion through the endothelium in a manner mimicking leukocytes. Through independent biochemical purification and a functional screen, we further identified PR/SET domain 4 (PRDM4) as a transcription factor interacting with the WW domains of YAP to mediate ITGB2 expression and cell invasion. Consistently, ITGB2 and PRDM4 mRNA levels are significantly increased in metastatic prostate cancer.

Differences in PSA screening are largely, but not entirely, responsible. We examined geographic differences in prevalence of histologic prostate inflammation and subsequent prostate cancer risk.Methods: Seven thousand nonHispanic white men were enrolled in the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial from Europe (n = 4,644), North America (n = 1,746), South America (n = 466), and Australia/New Zealand (n = 144). Histologic inflammation in baseline negative prostate biopsies was classified as chronic (lymphocytes/macrophages) or acute (neutrophils). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between region and prostate inflammation, and between region and prostate cancer risk at 2-year biopsy.Results: Prevalence of prostate inflammation varied across region, with broadly similar patterns for acute and chronic inflammation. Relative to Europe, prevalence of acute inflammation was higher in North America [odds ratio (OR), 1.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.51-2.08] and Australia/New Zealand (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.40-3.06). Men from these regions had lower prostate cancer risk than Europeans at biopsy. Among North Americans, prevalence of acute inflammation was higher in Canada versus the United States (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.07-1.83), but prostate cancer risk did not differ between these regions. Among Europeans, prevalence of acute inflammation was lower in Northern and Eastern (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97 and OR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.87, respectively), relative to Western Europe, and these men had higher prostate cancer risk at biopsy.Conclusions: Prevalence of histologic prostate inflammation varied by region. Geographic differences in prostate inflammation tracked inversely with geographic differences in prostate cancer risk.Impact: Characterization of premalignant prostate biology and the relationship with subsequent prostate cancer risk could inform prostate cancer prevention efforts.

Our previous finding showed that in utero and lactational (IUL) DEHP exposure could disrupt the balance of testosterone and estrogen and increase the susceptibility of prostate carcinogenesis. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the early-life specific epigenetic modifications could mediate the effect of DEHP exposure on prostate carcinogenesis in rodents, for epigenetic modifications play important roles in regulating prostate carcinogenesis. The pregnant rats were treated with corn oil (negative control) or DEHP at 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg BW/day from GD7 to PND21. On PND21, the expression and DNA methylation change of six prostate carcinogenesis-related genes (ESR2/GSTP1/NKX3.1/PSCA/PTGS2/Rassf1a) were assessed through SYBR-Green real-time PCR combined with pyrosequencing assay in F1 male offspring. On PND196, the relationship b(STP1, PSCA and PTGS2 in a dose-dependent manner, which were positively correlated with PIN scores, Gleason scores, serum PSA concentrations and negatively correlated with prostate/body weight ratio on PND196. Meanwhile, 1 mg/kg BW/day DEHP markedly reduced DNA methylation level of PSCA in all studied CpG sites. Significant inverse correlations between methylation levels of the promoter CpG site and PSCA mRNA expression were observed. These results indicated that transcriptional changes of GSTP1, PSCA and PTGS2 induced by DEHP exposure might be contribute to the increasing susceptibility of prostate carcinogenesis in late life.

Methods:   Pharmacokinetics of [Sc]Sc-PSMA-617 was evaluated in 5 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma using dynamic PET/CT, followed by 3 static PET/CT acquisitions and blood sample collection over 19.5 hours, as well as urine sample collection at 2 time points. Total activity measured in source organs by PET imaging, as well as counts per milliliter measured in blood and urine samples, was decay corrected back to the time of injection using the half-life of Sc. Afterward, forward decay correction using the half-life of Lu was performed, extrapolating the pharmacokinetics of [Sc]Sc-PSMA-617 to that of [Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. Source organs residence times and organ-absorbed doses for [Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 were calculated using OLINDA/EXM software. Bone marrow self-dose was determined with indirect blood-based method, and urinary bladder contents residence time was estimated by trapezoidal approximation. The maximum permissible activity of [Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was calculated for each patient considering external beam radiotherapy toxicity limits for radiation absorbed doses to kidneys, bone marrow, salivary glands, and whole body.  Results:   The predicted mean organ-absorbed doses were highest in the kidneys (0.44 mSv/MBq), followed by the salivary glands (0.23 mSv/MBq). The maximum permissible activity was highly variable among patients; limited by whole body-absorbed dose (1 patient), marrow-absorbed dose (1 patient), and kidney-absorbed dose (3 patients).

Objectives:   We evaluated the association of exposure to ALAN during sleeping time with breast and prostate cancer in a population based multicase-control study (MCC-Spain), among subjects who had never worked at night. We evaluated chronotype, a characteristic that may relate to adaptation to light at night.  Methods:   We enrolled 1,219 breast cancer cases, 1,385 female controls, 623 prostate cancer cases, and 879 male controls from 11 Spanish regions in 2008-2013. Indoor ALAN information was obtained through questionnaires. Outdoor ALAN was analyzed using images from the International Space Station (ISS) available for Barcelona and Madrid for 2012-2013, including data of remotely sensed upward light intensity and blue light spectrum information for each geocoded longest residence of each MCC-Spain subject.  Results:   Among Barcelona and Madrid participants with information on both indoor and outdoor ALAN, exposure to outdoor ALAN in the blue light spectrum was associated with breast cancer [adjusted odds ratio (OR) for highest vs. lowest tertile, OR=1.47; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.17] and prostate cancer (OR=2.05; 95% CI: 1.38, 3.03). In contrast, those exposed to the highest versus lowest intensity of outdoor ALAN were more likely to be controls than cases, particularly for prostate cancer. Compared with those who reported sleeping in total darkness, men who slept in ""quite illuminated"" bedrooms had a higher risk of prostate cancer (OR=2.79; 95% CI: 1.55, 5.04), whereas women had a slightly lower risk of breast cancer (OR=0.77; 95% CI: 0.39, 1.51).

We explored the therapeutic potential of a novel dual PI3 K/mTOR inhibitor, X480, to inhibit tumor growth and bone colonization using different in vivo prostate cancer models including the subcutaneous injection of aggressive and bone metastatic (PC3) and non-bone metastatic (22rv1) cell lines and preclinical models known to generate bone lesions.

Materials and methods:   40 patients were retrospectively analyzed. All of them had received prostatectomy. Thirteen out of 40 were addressed to gallium68 PSMA-11 (HBED-CC)-PET/CT for a biochemical relapse after RP, 14/40 after a salvage RT and 13/40 after salvage or adjuvant ADT. The PSA level ranged between 0.1 and 1.62 ng/ml (median value: 0.51 ng/ml). We studied the impact on the decision-making process of a multidisciplinary tumor board of additional data obtained from gallium68 PSMA-11 (HBED-CC)-PET/CT.  Results:   Thirty-one out of 40 evaluated patients showed positive findings at gallium68 PSMA-11 (HBED-CC)-PET/CT (77.5%). Of them, five were positive in the prostatic bed, nine in the pelvic nodes, twelve in nodes outside the pelvis and eight at bone level. Nine patients presented two different sites of relapse (22.5%). Gallium68 PSMA-11 (HBED-CC)-PET/CT data changed the therapeutic approach in 28 patients (70%).  Conclusions:   Gallium68 PSMA-11 (HBED-CC)-PET/CT can be a useful tool in the restaging of post-RP, RT or ADT patients presenting biochemical relapse of PC and it could change the decision-making process in up of 70% of these patients.

Cell surface markers are often associated with specific cell lineages and differentiation states in normal development and cancer. Here, we show that PrAd and NEPC can be broadly discriminated by cell-surface profiles based on the analysis of prostate cancer gene expression datasets. To overcome a dependence on predictions of human cell-surface genes and an assumed correlation between mRNA levels and protein expression, we integrated transcriptomic and cell-surface proteomic data generated from a panel of prostate cancer cell lines to nominate cell-surface markers associated with these cancer subtypes. FXYD3 and CEACAM5 were validated as cell-surface antigens enriched in PrAd and NEPC, respectively. Given the lack of effective treatments for NEPC, CEACAM5 appeared to be a promising target for cell-based immunotherapy.

The pathogenic bacteria identified were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 of 4), Enterococcus faecalis (1 of 4) and Escherichia coli that harbour extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL-productive E. coli) (2 of 4). The earliest outbreak was POD 2 and the latest was POD 14. Infectious complications tended to increase in patients in whom an indwelling urethral catheter was inserted (p = 0.0567). However, there were no statistically significant relationships between any risk factor and the occurrence of infectious complications. We concluded that CEZ is adequate for the prevention of perioperative infectious complications in transperineal prostate biopsies. Furthermore, we reaffirmed the importance of correct perioperative management, including preoperative assessment.""","""['Kyoko Baba', 'Yoshitaka Sekine', 'Yoshiyuki Miyazawa', 'Takahiro Syuto', 'Masashi Nomura', 'Hidekazu Koike', 'Hiroshi Matsui', 'Yasuhiro Shibata', 'Kazuto Ito', 'Kazuhiro Suzuki']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Infect Chemother""","""['Prevention of infectious complications after prostate biopsy procedure.', 'Zero hospital admissions for infection after 577 transperineal prostate biopsies using single-dose cephazolin prophylaxis.', 'Occurrence of infection following prostate biopsy procedures in Japan: Japanese Research Group for Urinary Tract Infection (JRGU) - a multi-center retrospective study.', 'Assessment of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent perioperative infection in patients undergoing prostate brachytherapy: multicenter cohort study.', 'Prostate Biopsy-related Infection: A Systematic Review of Risk Factors, Prevention Strategies, and Management Approaches.', 'Sepsis rates after template prostate biopsy with single-dose prophylactic antibiotic.', 'Role of Prophylactic Antibiotics in Transperineal Prostate Biopsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'TREXIT Is Now: Should We Abandon the Transrectal Route for Prostate Biopsy?

We aimed to compare the detection rate of software-assisted fusion TB (SA-TB) versus cognitive fusion TB (COG-TB) for PC and to evaluate potential clinical features in detecting PC and clinically significant PC (csPC) at TB.  Patients and methods:   This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with rising and/or persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) undergoing mpMRI followed by either transperineal SA-TB or transrectal COG-TB. The analysis showed a matched-paired analysis between SA-TB versus COG-TB without differences in clinical or radiological characteristics. Differences among detection of PC/csPC among groups were analyzed. A multivariable logistic regression model predicting PC at TB was fitted. The model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic-derived area under the curve, goodness of fit test, and decision-curve analyses.  Results:   One hundred ninety-one and 87 patients underwent SA-TB or COG-TB, respectively. The multivariate logistic analysis showed that SA-TB was associated with overall PC (odds ratio [OR], 5.70; P < .01) and PC at TB (OR, 3.00; P < .01) but not with overall csPC (P = .40) and csPC at TB (P = .40). A nomogram predicting PC at TB was constructed using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.0, age, PSA density and biopsy technique, showing improved clinical risk prediction against a threshold probability of 10% with a c-index of 0.83.

Methods:   21 male subjects with a clinical suspicion for, or known prostate cancer and previous THR were scanned at 1.5 T using a phased-array body coil. DWI was obtained using single-shot EPI and PROPELLER techniques using fat saturation (PROPELLER-DWI-FS), and without (PROPELLER-DWI-NFS). Image quality (the overall impression of diagnostic quality) was compared to T2-weighted (T2WI) imaging using a 5-point Likert scale, with diffusion sequences additionally scored for artefact and distortion according to a 4-point scale, with artefact defined as the amount of prostate affected and distortion as the degree of warping of the organ. The T2W and DW image volumes were compared to produce quantitative distortion maps. A two-sample Wilcoxon test compared the qualitative scores, with inter-reader variability calculated using Cohen's kappa.  Results:   21 patients were included in the study, with an average age of 70.4 years and PSA 9.2 ng/ml. Hip metalwork was present bilaterally in 3 patients, left-sided in 9, and right-sided in 9. PROPELLER-DWI-FS significantly improved image quality (p < 0.01) and reduced distortion (p < 0.01) when compared to standard EP-DWI. Artefact was not shown to be significantly improved. The last 5 patients in the study were additionally imaged with PROPELLER-DWI-NFS, which resulted in a significant reduction in artefact compared to EP-DWI (p < 0.05).

Methods:   Twenty-four patients with biochemical failure after non-prostatectomy definitive therapy, 16/24 of whom had undergone brachytherapy, underwent fluciclovine PET-CT and mpMR with interpretation by expert readers blinded to patient history, PSA and other imaging results. Reference standard was established via a multidisciplinary truth panel utilizing histology and clinical follow-up (22.9 ± 10.5 months) and emphasizing biochemical control. The truth panel was blinded to investigative imaging results. Diagnostic performance and interobserver agreement (kappa) for the prostate and extraprostatic regions were calculated for each of 2 readers for PET-CT (P1 and P2) and 2 different readers for mpMR (M1 and M2).  Results:   On a whole body basis, the detection rate for fluciclovine PET-CT was 94.7% (both readers), while it ranged from 31.6-36.8% for mpMR.

The increase in glucose uptake along with tumor progression is due to an increment of facilitative glucose transporters as GLUT1. GLUT1 prevents cell death of cancer cells caused by growth factors deprivation, but there is scarce information about its role on the damage caused by glucose deprivation, which usually occurs within the core of a growing tumor. In prostate cancer (PCa), GLUT1 is found in the most aggressive tumors, and it is regulated by androgens. To study the response of androgen-sensitive and insensitive PCa cells to glucose deprivation and the role of GLUT1 on survival mechanisms, androgen-sensitive LNCaP and castration-resistant LNCaP-R cells were employed. Results demonstrated that glucose deprivation induced a necrotic type of cell death which is prevented by antioxidants. Androgen-sensitive cells show a higher resistance to cell death triggered by glucose deprivation than castration-resistant cells. Glucose removal causes an increment of H2O2, an activation of androgen receptor (AR) and a stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase activity. In addition, glucose removal increases GLUT1 production in androgen sensitive PCa cells. GLUT1 ectopic overexpression makes PCa cells more resistant to glucose deprivation and oxidative stress-induced cell death. Under glucose deprivation, GLUT1 overexpressing PCa cells sustains mitochondrial SOD2 activity, compromised after glucose removal, and significantly increases reduced glutathione (GSH). In conclusion, androgen-sensitive PCa cells are more resistant to glucose deprivation-induced cell death by a GLUT1 upregulation through an enhancement of reduced glutathione levels.""","""['Pedro Gonzalez-Menendez', 'David Hevia', 'Rebeca Alonso-Arias', 'Alejandro Alvarez-Artime', 'Aida Rodriguez-Garcia', 'Sandrina Kinet', 'Ivan Gonzalez-Pola', 'Naomi Taylor', 'Juan C Mayo', 'Rosa M Sainz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Redox Biol""","""['GLUT1 is an AR target contributing to tumor growth and glycolysis in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancers.', 'p66Shc protein through a redox mechanism enhances the progression of prostate cancer cells towards castration-resistance.', 'Regulation of GLUT transporters by flavonoids in androgen-sensitive and -insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Anti-VEGF therapy selects for clones resistant to glucose starvation in ovarian cancer xenografts.', 'WZB117 Decorated Metformin-Carboxymethyl Chitosan Nanoparticles for Targeting Breast Cancer Metabolism.', 'Modulating Glycolysis to Improve Cancer Therapy.', 'Nano-Based Drug Delivery of Polyphenolic Compounds for Cancer Treatment: Progress, Opportunities, and Challenges.', 'Fasting glucose mediates the influence of genetic variants of SOD2 gene on lean non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.']"""

Results:   Among 2032 men, 467 (23.0%) were diabetic and 674 (33.2%) were diagnosed with PCa. Diabetes increased the overall risk of PCa (OR = 1.51, 95%CI: 1.12-2.05, P = 0.007), especially high-grade PCa (OR = 2.30, 95%CI: 1.47-3.61, P < 0.001), but was not associated with low- or intermediate-grade PCa. High-grade PCa risk was markedly increased in patients with increased diabetic duration and HbA1c.

Here we propose RGD-tagged magnetosomes (magnetosomes@RGD) as a biogenic, genetically engineered, inorganic platform for multivalent thermal cancer treatment. Magnetosomes@RGD are biomagnetite nanoparticles synthesized by genetically modified magnetotactic bacteria thanks to a translational fusion of the RGD peptide with the magnetosomal protein MamC. Magnetosomes@RGD thus combine the high crystallinity of their magnetite core with efficient surface functionalization. The specific affinity of RGD was first quantified by single-cell magnetophoresis with a variety of cell types, including immune, muscle, endothelial, stem and cancer cells. The highest affinity and cellular uptake was observed with PC3 prostatic and HeLa uterine cancer cells. The efficiency of photothermia and magnetic hyperthermia was then compared on PC3 cells.

Prolactin receptor (PRLR) is overexpressed in breast and prostate cancers and is a new target for cancer therapy. We evaluated REGN2878, an anti-PRLR monoclonal antibody, as an immunoPET reagent. REGN2878 was labeled with Zr-89 after conjugation with desferrioxamine B or labeled with I-131/I-124. In vitro determination of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of parental REGN2878, DFO-REGN2878, and iodinated REGN2878 was performed by examining the effect of the increasing amounts of these on uptake of trace-labeled I-131 REGN2878. REGN1932, a non-PRLR binding antibody, was used as a control. Imaging and biodistribution studies were performed in mice bearing tumor xenografts with various expression levels of PRLR, including MCF-7, transfected MCF-7/PRLR, PC3, and transfected PC3/PRLR and T4D7v11 cell lines. The specificity of uptake in tumors was evaluated by comparing Zr-89 REGN2878 and REGN1932, and in vivo competition compared Zr-89 REGN2878 uptake in tumor xenografts with and without prior injection of 2 mg of nonradioactive REGN2878. The competition binding assay of DFO-REGN2878 at ratios of 3.53-5.77 DFO per antibody showed IC50 values of 0.4917 and 0.7136 nM, respectively, compared to 0.3455 nM for parental REGN2878 and 0.3343 nM for I-124 REGN2878. Imaging and biodistribution studies showed excellent targeting of Zr-89 REGN2878 in PRLR-positive xenografts at delayed times of 189 h (presented as mean ± 1 SD, percent injected activity per mL (%IA/mL) 74.6 ± 33.8%IA/mL). In contrast, MCF-7/PRLR tumor xenografts showed a low uptake (7.0 ± 2.3%IA/mL) of control Zr-89 REGN1932 and a very low uptake and rapid clearance of I-124 REGN2878 (1.4 ± 0.6%IA/mL). Zr-89 REGN2878 has excellent antigen-specific targeting in various PRLR tumor xenograft models. We estimated, using image-based kinetic modeling, that PRLR antigen has a very rapid in vivo turnover half-life of ∼14 min from the cell membrane. Despite relatively modest estimated tumor PRLR expression numbers, PRLR-expressing cells have shown final retention of the Zr-89 REGN2878 antibody, with an uptake that appeared to be related to PRLR expression. This reagent has the potential to be used in clinical trials targeting PRLR.""","""['Sarah M Cheal', 'Shutian Ruan', 'Darren R Veach', 'Valerie A Longo', 'Blesida J Punzalan', 'Jiong Wu', 'Edward K Fung', 'Marcus P Kelly', 'Jessica R Kirshner', 'Jason T Giurleo', 'George Ehrlich', 'Amy Q Han', 'Gavin Thurston', 'William C Olson', 'Pat B Zanzonico', 'Steven M Larson', 'Jorge A Carrasquillo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['ImmunoPET: Concept, Design, and Applications.', 'Preclinical Activity of the Novel Anti-Prolactin Receptor (PRLR) Antibody-Drug Conjugate REGN2878-DM1 in PRLR-Positive Breast Cancers.', '89Zr-DFO-J591 for immunoPET of prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in vivo.', 'Positron-Emission Tomography of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Xenografts in Mice with 89Zr-Labeled Trastuzumab-DM1: A Comparison with 89Zr-Labeled Trastuzumab.', 'Copper-64-immunoPET imaging: bench to bedside.', 'Periplasmic synthesis and purification of the human prolactin antagonist Δ1-11-G129R-hPRL.', 'ImmunoPET: Concept, Design, and Applications.']"""

The development of more effective therapies is, therefore, urgently needed. Targeted radionuclide therapy with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting ligands has revealed promising clinical results. In an effort to optimize this concept, it was the aim of this study to design and investigate PSMA ligands comprising different types of albumin binders. PSMA-ALB-53 and PSMA-ALB-56 were designed by combining the glutamate-urea-based PSMA-binding entity, a DOTA chelator and an albumin binder based on the 4-( p-iodophenyl)-moiety or p-(tolyl)-moiety. The compounds were labeled with 177Lu (50 MBq/nmol) resulting in radioligands of high radiochemical purity (≥98%). Both radioligands were stable (≥98%) over 24 h in the presence of l-ascorbic acid. The uptake into PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumor cells in vitro was in the same range (54-58%) for both radioligands; however, 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-53 showed a 15-fold enhanced binding to human plasma proteins. Biodistribution studies performed in PC-3 PIP/flu tumor-bearing mice revealed high tumor uptake of 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-53 and 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-56, respectively, demonstrated by equal areas under the curves (AUCs) for both radioligands. The increased retention of 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-53 in the blood resulted in almost 5-fold lower tumor-to-blood AUC ratios when compared to 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-56. Kidney clearance of 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 was faster, and hence, the tumor-to-kidney AUC ratio was 3-fold higher than in the case of 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-53. Due to the more favorable tissue distribution profile, 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 was selected for a preclinical therapy study in PC-3 PIP tumor-bearing mice. The tumor growth delay after application of 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 and 177Lu-PSMA-617 applied at the same activities (2 or 5 MBq per mouse) revealed better antitumor effects in the case of 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-56. As a consequence, the survival of mice treated with 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 was prolonged when compared to the mice, which received the same activity of 177Lu-PSMA-617. Our results demonstrated the superiority of 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 over 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-53 indicating that the p-(tolyl)-moiety was more suited as an albumin binder to optimize the tissue distribution profile. 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 was more effective to treat tumors than 177Lu-PSMA-617 resulting in complete tumor remission in four out of six mice. This promising results warrant further investigations to assess the potential for clinical application of 177Lu-PSMA-ALB-56.""","""['Christoph A Umbricht', 'Martina Benešová', 'Roger Schibli', 'Cristina Müller']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Optimization of the Tissue Distribution Profile.', 'Development of a new class of PSMA radioligands comprising ibuprofen as an albumin-binding entity.', 'Design and Preclinical Evaluation of an Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligand for 64Cu-Based PET Imaging.', 'Third-line treatment and 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen theranostics: therapy with lutetium-177.', 'Development of 177LuLu-LNC1003 for radioligand therapy of prostate cancer with a moderate level of PSMA expression.', 'Synthesis and radiolabelling of PSMA-targeted derivatives containing GYK/MVK cleavable linkers.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 theranostic probe for hepatocellular carcinoma imaging and therapy.', 'Pharmacological Optimization of PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy.', 'Modulating the pharmacokinetic profile of Actinium-225-labeled macropa-derived radioconjugates by dual targeting of PSMA and albumin.']"""

Purpose:   The Individualized Diet and Exercise Adherence Pilot Trial (IDEA-P) is a single-blind, randomized, pilot trial comparing the effects of a group-mediated, cognitive-behavioral (GMCB) exercise and dietary intervention (EX+D) with those of a standard-of-care (SC) control during the treatment of prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT.  Methods:   A total of 32 prostate cancer patients (M age = 66.28, SD = 7.79) undergoing ADT were randomly assigned to the 12-week EX+D intervention (n = 16) or control (n = 16). The primary outcome in IDEA-P was change in mobility performance with secondary outcomes including body composition and muscular strength. Blinded assessment of outcomes were obtained at baseline and at 2- and 3-month follow-ups.  Results:   Favorable adherence and retention rates were observed, and no serious intervention-related adverse events were documented. Intent-to-treat ANCOVA controlling for baseline value and ADT duration demonstrated that EX+D resulted in significantly greater improvements in mobility performance (p < .02), muscular strength (p < .01), body fat percentage (p < .05), and fat mass (p < .03) at 3-month follow-up, relative to control.  Conclusion:   Findings from the IDEA-P trial suggest that a GMCB-based EX+D intervention resulted in significant, clinically meaningful improvements in mobility performance, muscular strength, and body composition, relative to controls. Collectively, these results suggest that the EX+D was a safe and well-tolerated intervention for prostate cancer patients on ADT. The utility of implementing this approach in the treatment of prostate cancer patients on ADT should be evaluated in future large-scale efficacy trials.

The primary goal of this study was to explore whether three markers could predict the progression of PCa.  Method:   We investigated protein expression of Annexin 2 (ANX2), serine peptidase inhibitor, kazal type 1(SPINK1)/tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor (TATI), and heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) in 79 archival human prostate trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy tissues according to a modified World Health Organization (WHO) classification: normal (WHO1a), Gleason Score (GS6 (WHO1b), GS7 subgroups (WHO2 = 3 + 4, WHO3 = 4 + 3), GS8 (WHO4), and GS9-10 (WHO5). AA men aged 41-90 diagnosed from 1990 to 2013 at Howard University were included. Automated staining assessed expression of each biomarker. Spearman correlation assessed the direction and relationship between biomarkers, WHO and modified WHO GS, age, and 5-year survival. A two-tailed t-test and ANOVA evaluated biomarkers expression in relationship to WHO normal and other GS levels, and between WHO GS levels. A logistic and linear regression analysis examined the relationship between biomarker score and WHO GS categories. Kaplan-Meier curves graphed survival.  Results:   ANX2 expression decreased monotonically with the progression of PCa while expression of SPINK1/TATI and Hsp60 increased but had a more WHO GS-specific effect; SPINK1/TATI differed between normal and GS 2-6 and HSP60 differed between GS 7 and GS 2-6. WHO GS was found to be significantly and negatively associated with ANX2, and positively with SPINK1/TATI and Hsp60 expression. High SPINK1/TATI expression together with the low ANX2 expression at higher GS exhibited a bi-directional relationship that is associated with PCa progression and survival.  Conclusion:   Importantly, the data reveal that ANX2, and SPINK1/TAT1 highly associate with WHO GS and with the transition from one stage of PrCa to the next in AA men. Future research is needed in biracial and larger population studies to confirm this dynamic relationship between ANX2 and SPINK1 as independent predictors of PCa progression in all men.""","""['Desta A Beyene', 'Tammey J Naab', 'Norma F Kanarek', 'Victor Apprey', 'Ashwini Esnakula', 'Farahan A Khan', 'Marc R Blackman', 'Collis A Brown', 'Tamaro S Hudson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A high-density tissue microarray from patients with clinically localized prostate cancer reveals ERG and TATI exclusivity in tumor cells.', 'SPINK1 expression is enriched in African American prostate cancer but is not associated with altered immune infiltration or oncologic outcomes post-prostatectomy.', 'Novel Biomarker Signature That May Predict Aggressive Disease in African American Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'TATI as a biomarker.', 'Asymmetric apical domain states of mitochondrial Hsp60 coordinate substrate engagement and chaperonin assembly.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Selective vulnerabilities in the proteostasis network of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of heat shock proteins in aging and chronic inflammatory diseases.', 'Exploiting the HSP60/10 chaperonin system as a chemotherapeutic target for colorectal cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   Patients submitted to radical prostatectomy between 2008 and 2013 at a university hospital were followed with biannual serum PSA tests to determine the biochemical recurrence (BR). Archived paraffin blocks with neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissue were evaluated immunohistochemically for a panCD44 and MYC.  Results:   Sixty-nine patients completed follow-up and were included. CD44 positivity was observed in inflammatory cells (42%), nonneoplastic epithelium (39.7%), and neoplastic tissue (12.3%). In nonneoplastic tissues staining was observed in basal and luminal cells with the morphology of terminally differentiated cells. In neoplastic tissues, CD44 negativity was correlated with higher Gleason scores (Rho = -0.204; p = 0.042) and higher preoperative serum PSA levels when evaluated continuously (p = 0.029).

Alternative splicing variants of the androgen receptor (AR), e.g. AR-V7 can mediate resistance to AR-targeting substances abiraterone and enzalutamide. Semi-synthetic marine natural compound rhizochalinin decreases the expression of AR-V7 in human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells and thus resensitizes cells to enzalutamide. In the current study, we modified the structure of rhizochalin in order to determine structure-activity relationships (SAR) and optimize anticancer properties. Thus, we synthesized new 18-hydroxy- and 18-aminorhizochalins and its aglycones. All compounds exhibited anticancer properties in human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, induced apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest, and were capable of autophagy inhibition. SAR analysis showed an increase of pro-apoptotic activity in the row 18-amino < 18-hydroxy < 18-keto derivatives. In general, aglycones were more cytotoxic compared to glycosides. The sugar elimination was critical for the ability to suppress AR-signaling.

Testosterone is able to inhibit tumour cell growth in CRPC. Estrogen receptor-beta (ERβ) binds the testosterone-metabolites 3β-androstanediol and 3α-androstanediol in parallel to the canonical estradiol. In the prostate it is widely accepted that ERβ regulates estrogen signalling, mediating anti-proliferative effects. We used the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, VCaP, and the non-neoplastic BPH-1. VCaP cells were treated with 1 nmol/L testosterone over 20 passages, yielding the cell line VCaPrev, sensitive to hormone therapies. In contrast, LNCaP cells were grown for more than 100 passages yielding a high passage therapy resistant cell line (hiPLNCaP). VCaP and hiPLNCaP cell lines were treated with 5 μmol/L AA for more than 20 passages, respectively, generating the AA-tolerant-subtypes VCaPAA and hiPLNCaPAA. Cell lines were treated with testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), R1881, and the androgen-metabolites 3β-androstanediol and 3α-androstanediol. 3β-androstanediol or 3α-androstanediol significantly reduced proliferation in all cell lines except the BPH-1 and androgen receptor-negative PC-3 and markedly downregulated AR and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Whereas ERβ expression was increased in all cell lines except BPH-1 or PC-3. In summary, 3β-adiol or 3α-adiol, as well as DHT and R1881, significantly reduced tumour cell growth in CRPC cells. Thus, these compounds represent novel potential therapeutic approaches to overcome drug-resistance in CRPC, especially with regard to AR-V7 function in therapy resistance. Furthermore, these data confirm the tumour suppressor properties of ERβ in CRPC.""","""['Felix Bremmer', 'Hubertus Jarry', 'Valerie Unterkircher', 'Silke Kaulfuss', 'Peter Burfeind', 'Heinz-Joachim Radzun', 'Philipp Ströbel', 'Paul Thelen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Increased expression of CYP17A1 indicates an effective targeting of the androgen receptor axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Testosterone boosts for treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer: an experimental implementation of intermittent androgen deprivation.', 'Alterations in androgen deprivation enhanced prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression in prostate cancer cells as a target for diagnostics and therapy.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Role of ERα and ERβ in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Current Therapeutic Approaches.', 'AKR1C2 Promotes Metastasis and Regulates the Molecular Features of Luminal Androgen Receptor Subtype in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Modulating the Heat Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cell Lines In Vitro: A New Impact for Focal Therapies.', 'Transcriptional repression by androgen receptor: roles in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of Estrogen in Androgen-Induced Prostate Carcinogenesis in NBL Rats.', 'Clinical activity of abiraterone plus prednisone in docetaxel-naοve and docetaxel-resistant Chinese patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

We here present results on the feasibility of monitoring the expression of inflammatory molecules during radiotherapy. Plasma levels of a panel of soluble mediators associated with the inflammatory response were measured in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical radiotherapy. We measured 3 cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF alpha), 2 chemokines (CCL2 and CXCL8), and the long pentraxin PTX3. 20 patients were enrolled in this feasibility evaluation. All patients were treated with IMRT at 78 Gy. 3/20 patients reported grade 2 acute rectal toxicity, while 4/20 were scored as grade 2 late toxicity. CCL2 was the most interesting marker showing significant increase during and after radiotherapy. CCL2 levels at radiotherapy end could be modelled using linear regression including basal CCL2, age, surgery, hypertension, and use of anticoagulants.

Data were collected from the database of cancer registration and management system in Shanghai. Number of new cases, number of deaths, incidence, and mortality of each cancer type were calculated. The incidence and mortality rates were standardized. Temporal trends in the incidence and mortality were assessed using average annual percent change. There were 12,843 new cancer cases and 8,331 deaths from cancer in Luwan from January 2002 to December 2011. Age-standardized incidence rates by Segi's standard were 229.46 and 205.05 per 100,000 population for males and females, respectively. For males, the most commonly diagnosed cancers were lung, colorectal, stomach, liver, prostate, bladder, pancreas, kidney, lymphoma, and esophageal cancers; for females, they were breast, colorectal, lung, stomach, thyroid, liver, ovary, pancreas, uterus, and brain cancers. The incidence rates for all cancers combined increased significantly for both males and females from 2002 to 2011 (p < 0.05 for both). Age-standardized mortality rates were 147.04 and 90.62 per 100,000 population for males and females, respectively. The mortality rates have stayed stable during the 10-year period for both males and females (p > 0.05 for both).

This study sought to evaluate hospital choice policies from the perspective of men who received treatment for prostate cancer in the English National Health Service.  Materials and methods:   Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of 25 men across England. Fourteen men had chosen to receive treatment at a cancer centre other than their nearest. Interviews were recorded and analysed concurrently with data collection.  Results:   Men highlight that the geographical configuration of specialist services, the perceived urgency of the condition and the protocolisation of treatment pathways all limit their choice of a specialist treatment centre. Diseases such as cancer appear not to be well suited to the patient choice model, given the lack of hospital-level outcome data. Men instead use proxy measures of quality, leaving them vulnerable to influence by marketing and media reports. Men wishing to consider other treatment centres need to independently collect and appraise complex treatment-related information, which creates socioeconomic inequities in access to treatments. A positive impact of the choice agenda is that it enables patients to 'exit care' not meeting their expectations.  Discussion:   Policy makers have failed to consider the organisational, disease-specific and socio-cognitive factors that influence a patient's ability to choose their cancer treatment provider. Valid comparative hospital-level performance information is required to guide patients' choices, otherwise patients will continue to depend on informal sources, which will not necessarily improve their health care outcomes.""","""['A Aggarwal', 'S Bernays', 'H Payne', 'J van der Meulen', 'C Davis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Determinants of Patient Mobility for Prostate Cancer Surgery: A Population-based Study of Choice and Competition.', 'Effect of patient choice and hospital competition on service configuration and technology adoption within cancer surgery: a national, population-based study.', ""Hospital choice in Germany from the patient's perspective: a cross-sectional study."", 'Volume and health outcomes: evidence from systematic reviews and from evaluation of Italian hospital data.', 'Configuration of vascular services: a multiple methods research programme.', 'Impact of Cancer Care Regionalization on Patient Volume.', '""Shopping around"" for treatment is not a solution to cancer backlog.', 'Simulating the impact of centralization of prostate cancer surgery services on travel burden and equity in the English National Health Service: A national population based model for health service re-design.']"""

In this context, FS is based on the texture features obtained from the lumen, nuclei, cytoplasm and stroma, all of which are important tissue components. However, it is difficult to represent the high-dimensional textures of these tissue components. To solve this problem, we propose a new FS method that enables the selection of features with minimal redundancy in the tissue components.  Methodology:   We categorise tissue images based on the texture of individual tissue components via the construction of a single classifier and also construct an ensemble learning model by merging the values obtained by each classifier. Another issue that arises is overfitting due to the high-dimensional texture of individual tissue components. We propose a new FS method, SVM-RFE(AC), that integrates a Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) embedded procedure with an absolute cosine (AC) filter method to prevent redundancy in the selected features of the SV-RFE and an unoptimised classifier in the AC.  Results:   We conducted experiments on H&E histopathological prostate and colon cancer images with respect to three prostate classifications, namely benign vs. grade 3, benign vs. grade 4 and grade 3 vs. grade 4. The colon benchmark dataset requires a distinction between grades 1 and 2, which are the most difficult cases to distinguish in the colon domain. The results obtained by both the single and ensemble classification models (which uses the product rule as its merging method) confirm that the proposed SVM-RFE(AC) is superior to the other SVM and SVM-RFE-based methods.  Conclusion:   We developed an FS method based on SVM-RFE and AC and successfully showed that its use enabled the identification of the most crucial texture feature of each tissue component. Thus, it makes possible the distinction between multiple Gleason grades (e.g. grade 3 vs. grade 4) and its performance is far superior to other reported FS methods.""","""['Shahnorbanun Sahran', 'Dheeb Albashish', 'Azizi Abdullah', 'Nordashima Abd Shukor', 'Suria Hayati Md Pauzi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Artif Intell Med""","""['An Efficient Feature Selection Strategy Based on Multiple Support Vector Machine Technology with Gene Expression Data.', 'Optimizing Texture Retrieving Model for Multimodal MR Image-Based Support Vector Machine for Classifying Glioma.', 'Computer-assisted lip diagnosis on Traditional Chinese Medicine using multi-class support vector machines.', 'Selecting Feature Subsets Based on SVM-RFE and the Overlapping Ratio with Applications in Bioinformatics.', 'Overcome support vector machine diagnosis overfitting.', 'An augmented Snake Optimizer for diseases and COVID-19 diagnosis.', 'Correlation Analysis of Gene and Radiomic Features in Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases.', 'Ensemble of adapted convolutional neural networks (CNN) methods for classifying colon histopathological images.', 'Cluster Analysis of Cell Nuclei in H&E-Stained Histological Sections of Prostate Cancer and Classification Based on Traditional and Modern Artificial Intelligence Techniques.', 'Construction of a Support Vector Machine-Based Classifier for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Patients.']"""

The traditional survival partition model (SPM) cannot accurately predict long-term clinical outcomes because it is limited by its ability to capture the key consequences associated with this changing treatment paradigm. The objective of this study was to introduce and validate a discrete-event simulation (DES) model for prostate cancer.  Methods:   A DES model was developed to simulate overall survival (OS) and other clinical outcomes based on patient characteristics, treatment received, and disease progression history. We tested and validated this model with clinical trial data from the abiraterone acetate phase III trial (COU-AA-302). The model was constructed with interim data (55% death) and validated with the final data (96% death). Predicted OS values were also compared with those from the SPM.  Results:   The DES model's predicted time to chemotherapy and OS are highly consistent with the final observed data. The model accurately predicts the OS hazard ratio from the final data cut (predicted: 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.85 and final actual: 0.74; 95% CI 0.6-0.88). The log-rank test to compare the observed and predicted OS curves indicated no statistically significant difference between observed and predicted curves. However, the predictions from the SPM based on interim data deviated significantly from the final data.  Conclusions:   Our study showed that a DES model with properly developed risk equations presents considerable improvements to the more traditional SPM in flexibility and predictive accuracy of long-term outcomes.""","""['Feng Pan', 'Odette Reifsnider', 'Ying Zheng', 'Irina Proskorovsky', 'Tracy Li', 'Jianming He', 'Sonja V Sorensen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Value Health""","""['Impact of bone-targeted therapies in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate: post hoc analysis of study COU-AA-302.', 'Counterpoint: Chemotherapy vs Abiraterone for the Initial Management of Metastatic Prostate Cancer: The Case for Abiraterone.', 'Point: Chemotherapy vs Abiraterone for the Initial Management of Metastatic Prostate Cancer: The Case for Chemotherapy.', 'The optimal treatment of metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer: abiraterone acetate or docetaxel?', 'Pre-chemotherapy abiraterone acetate.

Materials and methods:   A total of 35 patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer (T1a and T1b) after TURP, underwent RRP and completed a 1 year follow up (group A). They were matched with a cohort of another 35 men (group B) in terms of age, body mass index (BMI), prostatic specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, prostate volume (before surgery), pathological stage and neurovascular bundle-sparing technique. That was a retrospective study completed between September 2011 and March 2014.  Results:   Not a significant difference was demonstrated among the two groups of patients concerning the functional and oncologic results. On the other hand, previous prostate surgery made the operation procedure more demanding. Besides, operative time and blood loss (though not translated in transfusion rates) were higher among patients in group A. Besides, catheter removal in group A patients was performed later than their counterparts of group B.  Conclusions:   RRP after TURP is a relatively safe procedure and in the hands of experienced surgeons, a previously performed TURP, does not seem to compromise oncologic outcomes of the operation. Continence is preserved, though erectile function seems to be compromised compared with patients undergoing RRP without prior TURP.

This study aimed to develop predictive models to estimate prostate cell density from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) data at a voxel level using machine learning techniques.  Material and methods:   In vivo mpMRI data were collected from 30 patients before radical prostatectomy. Sequences included T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. Ground truth cell density maps were computed from histology and co-registered with mpMRI. Feature extraction and selection were performed on mpMRI data. Final models were fitted using three regression algorithms including multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), polynomial regression (PR) and generalised additive model (GAM). Model parameters were optimised using leave-one-out cross-validation on the training data and model performance was evaluated on test data using root mean square error (RMSE) measurements.  Results:   Predictive models to estimate voxel-wise prostate cell density were successfully trained and tested using the three algorithms. The best model (GAM) achieved a RMSE of 1.06 (± 0.06) × 103 cells/mm2 and a relative deviation of 13.3 ± 0.8%.

Materials and methods:   This study included 656 patients referred for prostate biopsy who had a serum PSA of 2.6 - 10.0 ng/mL. Total prostate and transition zone volumes were measured by transrectal ultrasound using the prolate ellipsoid method. The clinical values of PSA, free-to-total (F/T) ratio, PSA density (PSAD) and PSATZ for the detection of prostate cancer were calculated and statistical comparisons between biopsy-positive (cancer) and biopsy-negative (benign) were conducted.  Results:   Cancer was detected in 172 patients (26.2%). Mean PSA, PSATZ, PSAD and F/T ratio were 7.5 ng/mL, 0.68 ng/mL/cc. 0.25 ng/mL/cc and 0.14 in patients with prostate cancer and 6.29 ng/mL, 0.30 ng/mL/cc, 0.16 ng/mL/cc and 0.22 in patients with benign biopsies, respectively. ROC curves analysis demonstrated that PSATZ had a higher area under curve (0,838) than F/T ratio (0,806) (P<0.001) and PSAD (0,806) (P<0.001). With a cut-off value of 0.22 ng/mL/cc, PSATZ had 100% of sensitivity and could have prevented 24% of unnecessary biopsies.

We use five barcode DNAs to label different gold nanoparticles that can selectively bind specific antigens. After the completion of the sandwich assay, barcode DNAs are released and subject to nanopore translocation tests.

Steroid based scaffolds have been extensively used as active pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of various diseases including the deadly disease of cancer which despite the recent advances in the early diagnosis, prevention and therapy, remains a clinical challenge affecting millions of people world over and is one of the leading causes of death. It thus warrants the development of new drugs against this dreadful disease through exploitation of emerging molecularly defined targets.  Methods:   The present study explores the effect of novel steroidal pyrazolines as presumed inhibitors of 5α- reductase (5AR) and 17α-hydroxylase-C17,20-lyase as a target for treatment of prostate cancer. A series of 1,5- diaryl pyrazoline pregnenolones were synthesized and screened for 5α-reductase inhibitory activities. Synthesis of the analogs is multistep and proceeds in good overall yields. The key step in the synthesis of 1,5- disubstituted pyrazolinyl pregnenolones is the heterocyclization of bezylidine derivatives (3) in presence of phenylhydrazines (4) through the initial formation of the phenylhydrazones, which undergo concomitant cyclization to generate the stable pyrazoline derivatives.  Results:   All the synthesised D-ring 1,5-disubstituted pyrazolinyl pregnenolone derivatives (5a-l) were screened for prostate cancer cell inhibitory, 5α-reductase and 17α-hydroxylase-C17,20-lyase inhibitory activity. Amongst all the compounds screened for their 5α-reductase inhibitory activities, compound 5c, 5e, 5g and 5l were found to be the most active. Further, compounds 5g and 5h were found to have moderate 17α-hydroxylase-C17,20-lyase inhibitory activities.  Conclusion:   A series of D-ring 1,5-disubstituted pyrazolinyl pregnenolone derivatives (5a-l) were synthesized and screened for their prostate cancer cell inhibitory, 5a-reductase and 17α-hydroxylase-C17,20-lyase inhibitory activity. Amongst all the compounds screened for their 5α-reductase inhibitory activities, compound 5c, 5e, 5g and 5l were found to be the most active whereas compounds 5g and 5h were found to have moderate 17α- hydroxylase-C17,20-lyase inhibitory activities.""","""['Abid H Banday', 'Shameem A Shameem', 'Javid A Banday', 'Bashir A Ganaie']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Steroidal pyrazolines and pyrazoles as potential 5α-reductase inhibitors: synthesis and biological evaluation.', 'Synthesis and evaluation of novel steroidal oxime inhibitors of P450 17 (17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17-20-lyase) and 5 alpha-reductase types 1 and 2.', 'C16 and C17 substituted derivatives of pregnenolone and progesterone as inhibitors of 17alpha-hydroxylase-C17, 20-lyase: synthesis and biological evaluation.', 'Steroidal Oximes: Useful Compounds with Antitumor Activities.', '17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (p450(17alpha)) inhibitors in the treatment of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Highlights on Steroidal Arylidene Derivatives as a Source of Pharmacologically Active Compounds: A Review.']"""

The risk of prostate cancer was analyzed with stratification by age. Multivariate-adjusted Cox regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between prostate cancer and metabolic diseases by age groups. The risk of prostate cancer increased continuously with age and 59 years may be a point of inflection. The hazard ratio (HR) of prostate cancer development rose sharply as that age point passed. The population with metabolic diseases was more likely to develop prostate cancer than the population without any of these components. In addition, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) decreased from the youngest age group to the age group comprising 55-59 year olds. Beyond this age group, there was a plateau. The relative risk for prostate cancer associated with metabolic diseases also showed divergent associations with age. The risk of prostate cancer increased continuously with age and the peak Youden index was at 59 years.

The 'ultimate incidence' of PC and clinically significant PC (CSPC) were estimated using the PC risk calculator. Changes in the age-standardized incidence rate (AIR) during this period were analyzed. The calculated coefficients of linear regression for age versus log10 PSA fluctuated during the 25-year period, but no trend was observed. In addition, the percentage of men with a PSA above cut-off values varied in each 5-year period, with no specific trend. The 'risk calculator (RC)-based AIR' of PC and CSPC were stable between 1992 and 2016. Therefore, the baseline risk for developing PC has remained unchanged in the past 25 years, in Japan.

In order to evaluate if and how fluorescence-guidance can help realize improvements beyond the current state-of-the-art in sentinel node (SN) biopsy procedures, use of the hybrid tracer indocyanine green (ICG)-99mTc-nancolloid was evaluated in a large cohort of patients.  Patients and methods:   A prospective trial was conducted (n = 501 procedures) in a heterogeneous cohort of 495 patients with different malignancies (skin malignancies, oral cavity cancer, penile cancer, prostate cancer and vulva cancer). After injection of ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid, SNs were preoperatively identified based on lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT. Intraoperatively, SNs were pursued via gamma tracing, visual identification (blue dye) and/or near-infrared fluorescence imaging during either open surgical procedures (head and neck, penile, vulvar cancer and melanoma) or robot assisted laparoscopic surgery (prostate cancer). As the patients acted as their own control, use of hybrid guidance could be compared to conventional radioguidance and the use of blue dye (n = 300). This was based on reported surgical complications, overall survival, LN recurrence free survival, and false negative rates (FNR).  Results:   A total of 1,327 SN-related hotspots were identified on 501 preoperative SPECT/CT scans. Intraoperatively, a total number of 1,643 SNs were identified based on the combination of gamma-tracing (>98%) and fluorescence-guidance (>95%). In patients wherein blue dye was used (n = 300) fluorescence-based SN detection was superior over visual blue dye-based detection (22-78%). No adverse effects related to the use of the hybrid tracer or the fluorescence-guidance procedure were found and outcome values were not negatively influenced.

Under MRI guidance, focused high frequency ultrasound energy was delivered to ablate the target tissue. Treatment-related adverse events were recorded. Oncologic outcomes were evaluated with multiparametric MRI, PSA and TRUS biopsy at 6 months following treatment.  Results:   Ten target lesions [six Gleason 6 lesions, two Gleason 7 (3 + 4) and two Gleason 7 (4 + 3)] were treated in eight men (prostate volume range, 25-50 cc; mean MRI time, 248 min per patient; mean sonication duration, 65 min). Mean target volume was 2.7 cc and mean post-treatment non-perfused volume was 4.3 cc. Quality of life parameters were similar between baseline and 6 months in 6/8 patients. All treated regions were negative on MRI; 4/8 patients and 6/10 target lesions (60%) were clear of disease on biopsy. One patient with 2-mm Gleason 8 disease in one of five cores from treatment site (4 + 3 disease at baseline) subsequently underwent prostatectomy with negative surgical margins.

Methods:   Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with a variety of health professionals. Interview questions explored health professional's perspectives on barriers to cancer care for patients, factors which influence clinical care, and access to support in regional areas. Data were interpreted using an inductive thematic analysis approach.  Results:   Two global themes were identified: rural culture and the health system. Within these global themes, health professionals discussed barriers to cancer care in regional areas, predominantly associated with travel, limited workforce, and poor communication within the health system. Participants also noted many positive aspects of cancer care in regional areas, including more personalised care for the patients and faster career progression for professionals.  Conclusions:   Despite several strategies to improve rural cancer care in recent times, including innovative models of care and increased infrastructure, health professionals still perceive many barriers to cancer care in regional Australia. These are predominantly associated with patient demographics, travel difficulties, and inadequate governance. However, there are also many notable benefits to receiving care in regional areas which have been absent from previous literature. These positive factors should be incorporated in efforts to enhance regional cancer care through the recruitment of health professionals to regional areas and development of regional community support networks.""","""['Fiona Crawford-Williams', 'Belinda Goodwin', 'Sonja March', 'Michael J Ireland', 'Melissa K Hyde', 'Suzanne K Chambers', 'Joanne F Aitken', 'Jeff Dunn']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Are visiting oncologists enough?

Preclinical studies suggest that lifestyle modifications may exert favorable effects on tumor biology. Randomized controlled trials in the presurgical setting serve as an ideal means to translate this research to humans; however, little is known about the characteristics of patients who enroll in these presurgical trials versus those who do not.  Methods:   Screening databases from three presurgical lifestyle intervention trials for breast and prostate cancer patients conducted at Duke University Medical Center (NCT00049309) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (NCT02224807 and NCT01886677) were combined for analysis. Demographic and anthropometric differences between enrolled vs. non-enrolled individuals were assessed using Chi-square for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables.  Results:   There was no difference in participation rate when comparing minority status or overweight and obese patients. However, obese females were slightly more likely to enroll than women who were overweight (p = 0.110), a trend not seen in men. Women were also less likely than men to participate if their study site was >25 miles from their home (p = 0.034). Patients who had completed a college degree were somewhat less likely to enroll than those with less educational attainment (p = 0.072). Of those who did not enroll, 80% cited a lack of time.  Conclusion:   Similar to other clinical trials, lack of time is a leading barrier to enrollment, and travel/distance appears to be a greater barrier for women in presurgical studies. Larger presurgical lifestyle intervention trials will require tailored strategies to enhance recruitment.""","""['John A Dasher', 'Andrew D Frugé', 'Denise C Snyder', 'Wendy Demark-Wahnefried']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Contemp Clin Trials Commun""","""['Feasibility outcomes of a presurgical randomized controlled trial exploring the impact of caloric restriction and increased physical activity versus a wait-list control on tumor characteristics and circulating biomarkers in men electing prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'The effect of weight management interventions that include a diet component on weight-related outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women: a systematic review protocol.', 'Characteristics Associated With Participation in a Behavioral Weight Loss Randomized Control Trial in the U.S. Military.', 'Lifestyle intervention for improving school achievement in overweight or obese children and adolescents.', 'Offspring body size and metabolic profile - effects of lifestyle intervention in obese pregnant women.', 'PCaLiStDB: a lifestyle database for precision prevention of prostate cancer.', 'Randomized trial of weight loss in primary breast cancer: Impact on body composition, circulating biomarkers and tumor characteristics.', 'Current opportunities to catalyze research in nutrition and cancer prevention - an interdisciplinary perspective.']"""

Anti-angiogenic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of advanced-stage cancers, however there is still demand for further improvement. This necessitates new experimental models that will allow researchers to reliably study aspects of angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to demonstrate an in vivo technique in which the highly vascular and accessible chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chick embryo is used to study tumour-induced changes in the macro and microvessels.  Materials and methods:   Two cancer cell lines (human melanoma (C8161) and human prostate cancer (PC3)) were selected as model cells. Human dermal fibroblasts were used as a control. One million cells were labelled with green fluorescent protein and implanted on the CAM of the chick embryo at embryonic development day (EDD) 7 and angiogenesis was evaluated at EDDs 10, 12 and 14. A fluorescently-tagged lectin (lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA)) was injected intravenously into the chick embryo to label endothelial cells. The LCA is known to label the luminal surface of endothelial cells, or dextrans, in the CAM vasculature. Macrovessels were imaged by a hand-held digital microscope and images were processed for quantification. Microvessels were evaluated by confocal microscopy. Tumour invasion was assessed by histological and optical sectioning.  Results:   Tumour cells (C8161 and PC3) produced quantifiable increases in the total area covered by blood vessels, compared to fibroblasts when assessed by digital microscopy. Tumour invasion could be demonstrated by both histological and optical sectioning. The most significant changes in tumour vasculature observed were in the microvascular structures adjacent to the tumour cells, which showed an increase in the endothelial cell coverage. Additionally, tumour intravasation and tumour thrombus formation could be detected in the areas adjacent to tumour cells. The fragility of tumour blood vessels could be demonstrated when tumour cells seeded on a synthetic scaffold were grown on CAM.  Conclusion:   We report on a modification to a well-studied CAM in vivo assay, which can be effectively used to study tumour induced changes in macro and microvasculature.""","""['Naside Mangir', 'Ahtasham Raza', 'John W Haycock', 'Christopher Chapple', 'Sheila Macneil']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""In Vivo""","""['Cell-mediated delivery of fibroblast growth factor-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor onto the chick chorioallantoic membrane: endothelial fenestration and angiogenesis.', 'Quantitative Analysis of Human Cancer Cell Extravasation Using Intravital Imaging.', 'Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane model systems to study and visualize human tumor cell metastasis.', 'Chorioallantoic Membrane Microtumor Model to Study the Mechanisms of Tumor Angiogenesis, Vascular Permeability, and Tumor Cell Intravasation.', 'The chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane as a model for in vivo research on angiogenesis.', 'The CAM Model-Q&A with Experts.', 'Cold Atmospheric Plasma Reduces Vessel Density and Increases Vascular Permeability and Apoptotic Cell Death in Solid Tumors.', 'Patient-Derived In Vitro and In Vivo Models of Cancer.', 'Microvascular Experimentation in the Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane as a Model for Screening Angiogenic Agents including from Gene-Modified Cells.', 'Extending the Applicability of In Ovo and Ex Ovo Chicken Chorioallantoic Membrane Assays to Study Cytostatic Activity in Neuroblastoma Cells.']"""

Par-4 induces apoptosis selectively in various types of cancer cells but not normal cells. We found that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells from human patients and from Eµ-Tcl1 mice constitutively express Par-4 in greater amounts than normal B-1 or B-2 cells. Interestingly, knockdown of Par-4 in human CLL-derived Mec-1 cells results in a robust increase in p21/WAF1 expression and decreased growth due to delayed G1-to-S cell-cycle transition. Lack of Par-4 also increased the expression of p21 and delayed CLL growth in Eμ-Tcl1 mice. Par-4 expression in CLL cells required constitutively active B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, as inhibition of BCR signaling with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs caused a decrease in Par-4 messenger RNA and protein, and an increase in apoptosis. In particular, activities of Lyn, a Src family kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase, and Bruton tyrosine kinase are required for Par-4 expression in CLL cells, suggesting a novel regulation of Par-4 through BCR signaling. Together, these results suggest that Par-4 may play a novel progrowth rather than proapoptotic role in CLL and could be targeted to enhance the therapeutic effects of BCR-signaling inhibitors.""","""['Mary K McKenna', 'Sunil K Noothi', 'Sara S Alhakeem', 'Karine Z Oben', 'Joseph T Greene', 'Rajeswaran Mani', 'Kathryn L Perry', 'James P Collard', 'Jacqueline R Rivas', 'Gerhard C Hildebrandt', 'Roger A Fleischman', 'Eric B Durbin', 'John C Byrd', 'Chi Wang', 'Natarajan Muthusamy', 'Vivek M Rangnekar', 'Subbarao Bondada']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Blood""","""['Par-4 overexpression impedes leukemogenesis in the Eµ-TCL1 leukemia model through downregulation of NF-κB signaling.', 'miR-181b as a therapeutic agent for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the Eµ-TCL1 mouse model.', 'Sprouty 2: a novel attenuator of B-cell receptor and MAPK-Erk signaling in CLL.', 'BCR signaling in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and related inhibitors currently in clinical studies.', 'Role of spleen tyrosine kinase in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.', 'LINC01589 serves as a potential tumor-suppressor and immune-related biomarker in endometrial cancer: A review.', 'Expression of PAWR predicts prognosis of ovarian cancer.', 'Par-4 overexpression impedes leukemogenesis in the Eµ-TCL1 leukemia model through downregulation of NF-κB signaling.', 'Inhibition of CRM1 activity sensitizes endometrial and ovarian cell lines to TRAIL-induced cell death.']"""

Yet, older people commonly underestimate this risk, are less likely to be aware of the early symptoms, and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage cancer. Mass media are a key influence on the public's understanding health issues, including cancer risk. This study investigates how news media have represented age and other risk factors in the most common cancers over time.  Methods:   Eight hundred articles about the four most common cancers (breast, prostate, lung and colorectal) published within eight UK national newspapers in 2003, 2004, 2013 and 2014 were identified using the Nexis database. Relevant manifest content of articles was coded quantitatively and subjected to descriptive statistical analysis in SPSS to identify patterns across the data.  Results:   Risk was presented in half of the articles but this was rarely discussed in any depth and around a quarter of all articles introduced more than one risk factor, irrespective of cancer site. Age was mentioned as a risk factor in approximately 12% of all articles and this varied by cancer site. Age was most frequently reported in relation to prostate cancer and least often in articles about lung cancer. Articles featuring personal narratives more frequently focused on younger people and this was more pronounced in non-celebrity stories; only 15% of non-celebrity narratives were about people over 60. Other common risks discussed were family history and genetics, smoking, diet, alcohol, and environmental factors. Family history and genetics together featured as the most common risk factors. Risk factor reporting varied by site and family history was most commonly associated with breast cancer, diet with bowel cancer and smoking with lung cancer.  Conclusion:   Age and older adults were largely obscured in media representation of cancer and cancer experience. Indeed common risk factors in general were rarely discussed in any depth. Our findings will usefully inform the development of future cancer awareness campaigns and media guidelines. It is important that older adults appreciate their heightened risk, particularly in the context of help-seeking decisions.""","""['Sara Macdonald', 'Yvonne Cunningham', 'Chris Patterson', 'Katie Robb', 'Una Macleod', 'Thomas Anker', 'Shona Hilton']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Public Health""","""['Oral cancer: exploring the stories in United Kingdom newspaper articles.', 'How does the media profile of cancer compare with prevalence?', 'Views of students of extension nursing studies about cancer prophylaxis.', 'Epidemiology of cancer in the United States.', 'Risk factors of main cancer sites.', 'A multinational investigation of healthcare needs, preferences, and expectations in supportive cancer care: co-creating the LifeChamps digital platform.', 'Cancer-related stigma in the USA and Israeli mass media: an exploratory study of structural stigma.', 'The integrated screening action model (I-SAM): A theory-based approach to inform intervention development.', 'Chilean Digital Press Coverage of the Relation between Diet and Mental Health.', ""The North American Layman's Understanding of COVID-19: Are We Doing Enough?""]"""

The infection may regulate several factors that influence prostate cancer growth in susceptible individuals. The aim of this study was to predict M. hominis proteins targeted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the host cell, and their potential role in the induction of prostate cancer. From the whole proteome of M. hominis, 19 proteins were predicted to be targeted into the ER of host cells. The results of our study predict that several proteins of M. hominis may be targeted to the host cell ER, and possibly alter the normal pattern of protein folding.

Methods:   Between September and December 2017, 101 men with moderate-to-severe BPH symptoms and prostate volume of 80-150 mL underwent aquablation in a prospective multicentre international clinical trial. Baseline demographics and standardized postoperative management variables were carefully recorded in a central independently monitored database. Surgeons answered analogue scale questionnaires on intra-operative technical factors and postoperative management. Adverse events up to 1 month were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee.  Results:   The mean (range) prostate volume was 107 (80-150) mL. The mean (range) operating time was 37 (15-97) min and aquablation resection time was 8 (3-15) min. Adequate adenoma resection was achieved with a single pass in 34 patients and with additional passes in 67 patients (mean 1.8 treatment passes), all in a single operating session. Haemostasis was achieved using either a Foley balloon catheter placed in the bladder under traction (n = 98, mean duration 18 h) or direct tamponade using a balloon inflated in the prostate fossa (n = 3, mean duration 15 h). No patient required electrocautery for haemostasis at the time of the primary procedure. The mean length of stay after the procedure was 1.6 days (range same day to 6 days). The Clavien-Dindo grade ≥2 event rate observed at 1 month was 29.7%. Bleeding complications were recorded in 10 patients (9.9%) during the index procedure hospitalization prior to discharge, and included six (5.9%) peri-operative transfusions.  Conclusions:   Aquablation is feasible and safe in treating men with men with large prostates (80-150 mL).

We aimed to explore the role of long non-coding RNA highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) in the sensitivity of PCa cells to irradiation. Survival rate, cell apoptosis, cycle, expressions of related proteins, and caspase-3 activity were assessed to explore the effects of HULC on sensitivity of PCa cells to irradiation. Expression of HULC in DU-145, PC3, LNCaP, and RWPE-1 cells was determined and the influence of HULC on DU-145 cells was explored. Then, PC3 cells aberrantly expressing HULC were implanted into NOD-SCID mice for tumor xenograft study. Changes of autophagy after aberrant expression of HULC in vivo and in vitro were tested. Furthermore, the interacted protein of HULC and involved signaling pathway were investigated. In PC3 and LNCaP cells under irradiation, survival rate and cell cycle were decreased and apoptosis was increased by HULC knockdown. HULC knockdown arrested PC3 cells at G0/G1 phase. DU-145 was sensitive to irradiation, and resistance to irradiation of DU-145 cells was enhanced by HULC overexpression. Moreover, HULC knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of PC3 xenografts to irradiation. HULC knockdown promoted autophagy through interaction with Beclin-1 and inhibition of mTOR, resulting in increased apoptosis. HULC knockdown improved sensitivity of PCa cells to irradiation both in vivo and in vitro.

To account for different cancer stages, two patient populations were analyzed. The first group consisted of patients on medication for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). The second group is comprised of patients who ended up receiving specific therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). For each treatment, the average of treatment duration and the portion of patients transitioning to a consecutive treatment was calculated.

In the first year of our observational study 786 patients commenced a HSPC treatment and 695 received a CRPC specific therapy Among the HSPC group, we found that combination hormonal therapy, comprised of a gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist or antagonist with an antiandrogen was more common than monotherapy. The results of the CRPC group indicated that chemotherapy administration was for a shorter time period in a real-world setting as compared to published clinical studies.

Recent studies in cancer highlight an important role for small extracellular nanovesicles secreted by cancer cells as modulators of cancer-associated stroma, leading to enhanced angiogenesis and metastatic priming. The intrinsic factors regulating extracellular nanovesicle biogenesis and secretion are therefore relevant in studies of nano-communication in the cancer milieu. We generated prostate cancer cells bearing stable knockdown of several candidate vesicle regulating factors and examined the impact on cell health, vesicle secretion and on communication with fibroblastic stromal cells. We highlight that RAB11B and RAB35 regulate phenotypically distinct nanovesicle populations, each accounting for only around 20% of the total. Depleting RAB35, but not RAB11B leaves a remaining population of vesicles whose phenotype is insufficient for driving fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, leading to attenuated motile behaviours in 3D in vitro models. Co-implantation of tumour cells with stromal fibroblasts in xenografts similarly showed that RAB11B knockdown had little effect on growth rates in vivo. In contrast, significant attenuation in growth, and attenuation of myofibroblasts at the tumour site was evident when using RAB35-knockdown cells. The study concludes that a RAB35 regulated nanovesicle sub-population is particularly important for communication between cancer and stromal cells, and is required for generating a tumour-supportive microenvironment.""","""['V Yeung', 'J P Webber', 'E A Dunlop', 'H Morgan', 'J Hutton', 'M Gurney', 'E Jones', 'J Falcon-Perez', 'Z Tabi', 'R Errington', 'A Clayton']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Differentiation of tumour-promoting stromal myofibroblasts by cancer exosomes.', 'Tumour-stroma interactions between metastatic prostate cancer cells and fibroblasts.', 'Reactive stroma in human prostate cancer: induction of myofibroblast phenotype and extracellular matrix remodeling.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Tumor-stroma interactions directing phenotype and progression of epithelial skin tumor cells.', 'Extracellular Vesicles as New Players in Drug Delivery: A Focus on Red Blood Cells-Derived EVs.', 'Extracellular Vesicles in Corneal Fibrosis/Scarring.', 'Extracellular Vesicles from Human Cerebrospinal Fluid Are Effectively Separated by Sepharose CL-6B-Comparison of Four Gravity-Flow Size Exclusion Chromatography Methods.', 'The implications of exosomes in pregnancy: emerging as new diagnostic markers and therapeutics targets.', 'Extracellular Vesicles Secreted by Corneal Myofibroblasts Promote Corneal Epithelial Cell Migration.']"""

Cytokines promotes ligand independent activation of AR. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in CRPC patients and regulate AR activity. However, progression to CRPC is not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed differential protein expression in LNCaP cells treated with IL-6 using proteomics. Results revealed altered expression of 27 proteins and Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 plays a predominant role in co-regulation of altered proteins. Interestingly, IL-6 induced VCP expression through Pim-1 via STAT3 is AR independent there by suggesting a role for VCP in CRPC. Transfection of LNCaP cells for VCP overexpression showed an increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion where as its inhibition by NMS-873 showed the reverse effect causing cell death. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that cell death occurs due to apoptosis by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, elevated cell cycle inhibitors p21, p27kip1, and active PARP and reduced Bcl-2. VCP promotes cell invasion and migration by altering E-cadherin and Vimentin levels inversely triggering EMT of PCa cells. VCP immunostaining revealed no staining in BPH but strong staining in PCa.

Excess cancer risk, as compared to the general population, was estimated using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). During 18,642 PYs, 246 LT recipients developed 266 de novo malignancies, corresponding to a 1.8-fold higher cancer risk (95% CI: 1.6-2.0).

Hypoxia is an important feature of the CRPC microenvironment and is closely associated with the progress of CRPC invasion. However, no research has been performed on the immune escape of CRPC from NK cells. The present study focused on this subject. Firstly, when the CRPC cell lines C4‑2 and CWR22Rv1 were induced by hypoxia, the expression of the UL16 binding protein (ULBP) ligand family of natural killer (NK) group 2D (NKG2D; ULBP‑1, ULBP‑2 and ULBP‑3) and MHC class I chain‑related proteins A and B (MICA/MICB) decreased. NKG2D is the main activating receptor of NK cells. Tumor cells were then co‑cultured with NK cells to conduct NK cell‑mediated cytotoxicity experiments, which revealed the decreased immune cytolytic activity of NK cells on hypoxia‑induced CRPC cells. In exploring the mechanism behind this observation, an increase in programmed death‑ligand 1 (PD‑L1) expression in CRPC cells induced by hypoxia was observed, while the addition of PD‑L1 antibody effectively reversed the expression of NKG2D ligand and enhanced the cytotoxic effect of NK cells on CRPC cells. In the process of exploring the upstream regulatory factors of PD‑L1, inhibition of the Janus kinase (JAK)1,2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway decreased the expression of PD‑L1 in CRPC cells. Finally, it was observed that combined inhibition of JAK1,2/PD‑L1 or Stat3/PD‑L1 was more effective than inhibition of a single pathway in enhancing the immune cytolytic activity of NK cells. Taking these results together, it is thought that combined inhibition of the JAK1,2/PD‑L1 and Stat3/PD‑L1 signaling pathways may enhance the immune cytolytic activity of NK cells toward hypoxia‑induced CRPC cells, which is expected to provide novel ideas and targets for the immunotherapy of CRPC.""","""['Li-Jun Xu', 'Qi Ma', 'Jin Zhu', 'Jian Li', 'Bo-Xin Xue', 'Jie Gao', 'Chuan-Yang Sun', 'Ya-Chen Zang', 'Yi-Bin Zhou', 'Dong-Rong Yang', 'Yu-Xi Shan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Inhibition of IL-6-JAK/Stat3 signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells enhances the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity via alteration of PD-L1/NKG2D ligand levels.', 'Adipocytes affect castration-resistant prostate cancer cells to develop the resistance to cytotoxic action of NK cells with alterations of PD-L1/NKG2D ligand levels in tumor cells.', 'ATM‑JAK‑PD‑L1 signaling pathway inhibition decreases EMT and metastasis of androgen‑independent prostate cancer.', 'Natural killer group 2D receptor and its ligands in cancer immune escape.', 'NK cell-based therapeutics for lung cancer.', 'Functional crosstalk and regulation of natural killer cells in tumor microenvironment: Significance and potential therapeutic strategies.', 'PD-L1: expression regulation.', 'HIF1α-dependent and independent pathways regulate the expression of PD-L1 in prostate cancer.', 'Addressing Natural Killer Cell Dysfunction and Plasticity in Cell-Based Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of STAT3 as a prognostic and immunological biomarker.']"""

In contrast to the specific AKT inhibitor triciribine hydrate, XKA demonstrated a weak inhibition of the AKT kinase activity in vitro. Knockdown of AKT protein levels reduced XKA-inhibitory action on prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells. Degradation of AKT protein was markedly observed in the XKA-treated PC-3 cells in comparison with triciribine hydrate treatment. There was no typical apoptosis induced by XKA in PC-3 cells. The propidium iodide-stained cells increased concentration-dependently when the cells were treated with XKA. Degradation of apoptosis-related proteins, such as p53 and PARP-1, was also detected in the XKA-treated PC-3 cells. Knockdown of p53 protein levels potentiated XKA action on non-small lung cancer A549 cells.

The CHIP vector was introduced into DU145 cancer cells and the cell biological behaviour was examined through a series of experiments, including cell growth, cell apoptosis and migration and invasion assays. The results indicated that the overexpression of CHIP in DU145 prostatic cancer cells promoted cell proliferation through activation of the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway, which subsequently increased cyclin D1 protein levels and decreased p21 and p27 protein levels. The overexpression of CHIP significantly increased the migration and invasion of the DU145 cells, which is possible due to activation of the AKT signaling pathway and upregulation of vimentin.

Here, we sought to investigate whether excess adiposity modulates the methylome of PPAT in PCa patients. DNA methylation profiling was performed in PPAT from obese/overweight (OB/OW, BMI > 25 kg m-2) and normal weight (NW, BMI < 25 kg m-2) PCa patients. Significant differences in methylated CpGs between OB/OW and NW groups were inferred by statistical modeling.  Results:   Five thousand five hundred twenty-six differentially methylated CpGs were identified between OB/OW and NW PCa patients with 90.2% hypermethylated. Four hundred eighty-three of these CpGs were found to be located at both promoters and CpG islands, whereas the representing 412 genes were found to be involved in pluripotency of stem cells, fatty acid metabolism, and many other biological processes; 14 of these genes, particularly FADS1, MOGAT1, and PCYT2, with promoter hypermethylation presented with significantly decreased gene expression in matched samples. Additionally, 38 genes were correlated with antigen processing and presentation of endogenous antigen via MHC class I, which might result in fatty acid accumulation in PPAT and tumor immune evasion.  Conclusions:   Results showed that the whole epigenome methylation profiles of PPAT were significantly different in OB/OW compared to normal weight PCa patients. The epigenetic variation associated with excess adiposity likely resulted in altered lipid metabolism and immune dysregulation, contributing towards unfavorable PCa microenvironment, thus warranting further validation studies in larger samples.""","""['Yan Cheng', 'Cátia Monteiro', 'Andreia Matos', 'Jiaying You', 'Avelino Fraga', 'Carina Pereira', 'Victoria Catalán', 'Amaia Rodríguez', 'Javier Gómez-Ambrosi', 'Gema Frühbeck', 'Ricardo Ribeiro#', 'Pingzhao Hu#']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['Epigenomic profiling of DNA methylation in paired prostate cancer versus adjacent benign tissue.', 'Epigenome-Wide Tumor DNA Methylation Profiling Identifies Novel Prognostic Biomarkers of Metastatic-Lethal Progression in Men Diagnosed with Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer: gene expression signature of human periprostatic adipose tissue.', 'Periprostatic Adipose Tissue Microenvironment: Metabolic and Hormonal Pathways During Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Peri-prostatic adipose tissue: the metabolic microenvironment of prostate cancer.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Pcyt2 deficiency causes age-dependant development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and insulin resistance that could be attenuated with phosphoethanolamine.', 'FTO and PLAG1 Genes Expression and FTO Methylation Predict Changes in Circulating Levels of Adipokines and Gastrointestinal Peptides in Children.', 'DNA methylome in visceral adipose tissue can discriminate patients with and without colorectal cancer.', ""Epigenome-wide association study of diet quality in the Women's Health Initiative and TwinsUK cohort.""]"""

The GSLs hydrolytic products are volatile compounds, which are known to exhibit bioactivities like antioxidant, fungicidal, bioherbicidal and anticancer. Among the Brassicaceae family, Brassica juncea is very well known for high content of GSLs. In the present study, the isolation of volatile oil of B. juncea var. raya was done by hydrodistillation method using clevenger apparatus and further there extraction was done by solvents ethyl acetate and dichloromethane. The volatile compounds present in the extract were analysed by gas chromatography/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/GC-MS). Fatty acid esters, sulphur and/or nitrogen compounds, carbonyl compounds and some other volatile compounds were also identified. Besides the analytical studies, the extracts were analysed for their bioactivities including radical scavenging activity by using DNA nicking assay and cytotoxic effect using different human cancer cell lines viz. breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), prostate (PC-3), lung (A-549), cervix (HeLa) and colon (HCT116) by MTT assay. The oil extracts were efficiently able to reduce the increase of cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Among all cell lines, the most effective anticancer activity was observed in case of breast (MCF-7) cancer cell line. So, MCF-7 cells were used for further mechanistic studies for analysing the mechanism of anticancer activity. Confocal microscopy was done for analysing morphological changes in the cells and the images confirmed the features typical of apoptosis. For evaluating the mode of cell death, spectrofluorometric determination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was done. The volatile oil extract treated MCF-7 cells had a significant increase in number of ROS, also there was a rise in percentage of cells with increased disruption of MMP. So, the present study marks necessary indication that B. juncea (raya) oil extracts significantly induces apoptosis in all the above mentioned cancer cells lines through a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway and thus play a remarkable role in death of cancer cells.""","""['Priyanka Bassan', 'Sakshi Bhushan', 'Tajinder Kaur', 'Rohit Arora', 'Saroj Arora', 'Adarsh Pal Vig']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Physiol Mol Biol Plants""","""['Anti-Carcinogenic Glucosinolates in Cruciferous Vegetables and Their Antagonistic Effects on Prevention of Cancers.', 'Correlation of Glucosinolates and Volatile Constituents of Six Brassicaceae Seeds with Their Antioxidant Activities Based on Partial Least Squares Regression.', 'Microwave-Assisted versus Conventional Isolation of Glucosinolate Degradation Products from Lunaria annua L. and Their Cytotoxic Activity.', 'Evaluating extraction conditions of glucosinolate hydrolytic products from seeds of Eruca sativa (Mill.)

As CSCs depend on their specific niche, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), elucidating the network between CSCs and TAMs may help to effectively inhibit the progression and ADT resistance of prostate cancer.Experimental Design: The underlying intracellular mechanism that sustains the stem-like characteristics of CSCs in prostate cancer was assessed via RNA sequencing, co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and other assays. A coculture system and cytokine antibody arrays were used to examine the interaction network between CSCs and TAMs. In addition, an orthotopic prostate cancer model was established to evaluate the in vivo effects of the combined targeting of CSCs and their interaction with TAMs on ADT resistance.Results: Autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7) facilitated the transcription of OCT4 via β-catenin, which binds to the OCT4 promoter, promoting CSC characteristics in prostate cancer, including self-renewal, tumor initiation, and drug resistance. In addition, CSCs remodeled their specific niche by educating monocytes/macrophages toward TAMs, and the CSC-educated TAMs reciprocally promoted the stem-like properties of CSCs, progression and ADT resistance of prostate cancer via IL6/STAT3. Furthermore, the combined targeting of CSCs and their interaction with TAMs by inhibiting ATG7/OCT4 and IL6 receptor effectively ameliorated ADT resistance in an orthotopic prostate cancer model.Conclusions: Targeting CSCs and their niche may prove to be a more powerful strategy than targeting CSCs alone, providing a rational approach to ameliorating ADT resistance in prostate cancer.

Method: A retrospective study of 203 patients from January 2010 to January 2014 who were underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to preoperative T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of fibrosis status of the urethral wall and periurethral tissue. One hundred and forty-four(≤2 grade) and 59 (≥3 grade) were classified into the no/mild and severe urethral fibrosis groups respectively. Urinary continence at 1, 3, 6, 12 months after operation were compared between this two groups respectively. Result: There was no significant difference in the two groups with respect to age, body mass index (BMI), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), international prostate symptom score (IPSS), prostate volume, preoperative prostate-specific antigen value, nerve-sparing procedure, postoperative Gleason score and pathological stage. The operation was completed successfully in all cases. With a median follow-up time of 15 months (ranged from 12 to 24 months), there was no statistical difference between the two groups in urinary continence at 1 month after operation (P>0.05). The incidences of continence in patients with no/mild fibrosis were significantly higher at 3, 6, 12 months after operation than those with severe fibrosis.

On the other hand, there were no difference in the concentration distributions and the mean values of AFP, CEA and PSA between the health disease - free group and the group below cut-off values, as well as between gender and ages. Of interest, the elevated mean value of STK1p of the group below the cut-off value was correlated to pre-malignancy and diseases associated with the risk process of malignancy in liver and prostate.

Update of 200 patients treatment results""","""Introduction:   This is an update regarding the treatment results of 200 prostate cancer patients’ (PCP) CyberKnife based radioablation (the first group in Poland). The purpose of this study is reevaluation (after 2 years) of this treatment modality results of low (LR) and intermediate risk (IR) (including T2c) PCP and failure analysis.  Material and methods:   200 PCP (95 LR, 86 IR, 19 T2c) 53 – 83 y.o. (mean 69) treated between 2011 and 2014. 48% used neoadjuvant ADT. The patients were irradiated every other day with a fraction dose of 7.25 Gy to the total dose 36.25 Gy (5 fractions in 9 days). Fiducials based tracking was performed. The patients were controlled on the treatment completion day, 1, 4, 8 months later and subsequently every 6 months. The PSA concentration, ADT usage, acute and late adverse effects (EORTC/RTOG) and other symptoms were evaluated. FU ranged from 1 to 63.6 months (mean 32.2, median 32.9).  Results:   The adverse effects percentage was very low; only 1 month after treatment the percentage of acute urinary reaction exceeded 40%. Only single G3 adverse effects were noted. Over 4 months the median PSA concentration declined from 3.75 to 0.27 ng/ml. 9 failures (4.5%) were noted – more among IR and patients without neoadjuvant ADT. No failure in the T2c group was found. Median time to failure was 32.4 months. Cox analysis revealed that the failure risk increases with the value of maximal PSA before treatment.  Conclusions:   CK based radioablation of LR and IR PCP is a safe and highly effective treatment modality. The main prognostic factor of failure after this treatment is probably the maximal PSA concentration before treatment. The neoadjuvant ADT in IR group should be considered. The lack of failures in the T2c group enables us to suggest that even more locally advanced patients (T3) with low PSA and maximal Gleason 3+4 could be treated with this modality.""","""['Leszek Miszczyk', 'Aleksandra Napieralska', 'Agnieszka Namysł-Kaletka', 'Grzegorz Woźniak', 'Małgorzata Stapór-Fudzińska', 'Grzegorz Głowacki', 'Andrzej Tukiendorf']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Przegl Lek""","""[]"""

Methods:   This study included 165 male patients with prostate cancer confirmed by biopsy. The patients were aged 58－78 (66.6±5.3) years and none had received androgen-deprivation therapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy previously. We obtained the baseline clinical data from the patients, including prostate biopsy Gleason scores and the levels of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), total testosterone (TT), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and prolactin. According to the results of bone scanning, we divided the patients into a bone metastasis and a non-bone metastasis group and screened out the differential factors by univariate analysis and the independent predictor of bone metastasis using the multivariate non-conditional logistic regression model.  Results:   Univariate analysis showed no statistically significant differences between the bone metastasis and non-bone metastasis groups in age (P = 0.126) or the levels of serum LH (P = 0.930), FSH (P = 0.763) and E2 (P = 0.256), but that the former had remarkably higher Gleason scores (P < 0.01), total PSA (P <0.01) and ALP (P <0.01) but a lower TT level than the latter (P = 0.013). According to the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis, serum ALP (P <0.01, OR = 1.018 ［1.011－1.026］) and total PSA (P <0.01, OR = 1.029 ［1.015－1.044］) could be regarded as independent predictors of bone metastasis of prostate cancer but not low serum TT (P = 0.531, OR = 0.999 ［0.996－1.002］) or biopsy Gleason score (P = 0.898, OR = 0.787 ［0.412－1.9559］).

SENP1, a member of this family, is highly expressed and plays oncogenic roles in diverse cancers including prostate cancer. However, the SENP1-transgenic mice exhibit aberrant transformation of the mouse prostate gland but do not develop cancer. Cellular Stress Response 1 (CSR1) is a tumor suppressor gene and frequently deleted in prostate cancers. Overexpression of CSR1 in prostate cancer cells inhibits colony formation, anchorage-independent growth and induces cell death.  Methods:   The relationship between CSR1 and SENP1 were determined by immunoprecipitation-based proteomics screen and verified by GST-pull down assay. In vivo SUMOylation assay was used to detect the direct effect of SENP1 in the regulation of CSR1. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based gene editing was used to generate Senp1-/- and CSR1-/- PC3 cells. FACS assay was used to determine the apoptosis ratio of cells after transfection.  Results:   CSR1 is SUMOylated at K582 and rapid ubiquitinated and degradated in prostate cancer cells. SENP1 interacts with and deSUMOylates CSR1 to prevent its degradation and enhances CSR1-dependent prostate cancer cell death.  Conclusion:   Thus, our data indicates that CSR1 is a critical SUMOylated substrate of SENP1 that might partially explain the controversial roles of SENP1 in prostate cancer development.""","""['Hua-Rong Luo', 'Ying Liu', 'Xiao-Dong Wan', 'Jun-Liang Li', 'Min Wu', 'Qi-Min Zhang', 'Deng-Long Wu', 'Xin Zhao', 'Tian-Ru Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['Momordin Ic, a new natural SENP1 inhibitor, inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'CSR1 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis of human hepatocellular carcinoma via inhibition of HPIP.', 'SUMO protease SENP1 deSUMOylates and stabilizes c-Myc.', 'Role of desumoylation in the development of prostate cancer.', 'Recent research and development of inhibitors targeting sentrin-specific protease 1 for the treatment of cancers.', 'SCARA3 inhibits cell proliferation and EMT through AKT signaling pathway in lung cancer.', 'Melatonin decreases androgen-sensitive prostate cancer growth by suppressing SENP1 expression.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Scavenger Receptor Class A to E Involved in Various Cancers.']"""

Materials and methods:   Prostate mpMRI at 3-Tesla with endorectal coil from 45 patients (n = 30 prostatectomy cases, n = 15 controls with negative magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or biopsy) were retrospectively interpreted. Sequences (T2-weighted [T2W] MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], and dynamic contrast-enhanced [DCE] MRI; N = 135) were separately distributed to three radiologists at different institutions. Readers evaluated each sequence blinded to other mpMRI sequences. Findings were correlated to whole-mount pathology. Cancer detection sensitivity, positive predictive value for whole prostate (WP), transition zone, and peripheral zone were evaluated per sequence by reader, with reader concordance measured by index of specific agreement. Cancer detection rates (CDRs) were calculated for combinations of independently read sequences.  Results:   44 patients were evaluable (cases median prostate-specific antigen 6.83 [ range 1.95-51.13] ng/mL, age 62 [45-71] years; controls prostate-specific antigen 6.85 [2.4-10.87] ng/mL, age 65.5 [47-71] years). Readers had highest sensitivity on DWI (59%) vs T2W MRI (48%) and DCE (23%) in WP. DWI-only positivity (DWI+/T2W-/DCE-) achieved highest CDR in WP (38%), compared to T2W-only (CDR 24%) and DCE-only (CDR 8%). DWI+/T2W+/DCE- achieved CDR 80%, an added benefit of 56.4% from T2W-only and of 42% from DWI-only (P < .0001). All three sequences interpreted independently positive gave highest CDR of 90%. Reader agreement was moderate (index of specific agreement: T2W = 54%, DWI = 58%, DCE = 33%).

Materials and methods:   The cadavers were placed in a lithotomy position and secured to the operating table. A 3-cm midline incision was made in the suprapubic skin fold. After opening the Retzius space, a single-port mini device (GelPOINT, Rancho Margarita, CA) was introduced percutaneously directly into the bladder. The da Vinci Si robotic platform (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) was docked to the GelPOINT by inserting 2 8-mm (robotic arms) and 1 12-mm (camera) trocar through the GelSeal Cap. The surgical steps for en bloc anterior prostatectomy were performed in the following order: (1) retrograde dissection of transition zone at the bladder neck, (2) lateral excision of the peripheral zone, and (3) urethrovesical anastomosis. Primary outcomes such as intraoperative complications, rate of conversion to standard techniques, and operative times were recorded.  Results:   Single-port transvesical robotic approach for anterior partial prostatectomy was technically completed in 2 male cadavers.

Thus, the aim of this research project was to conduct a study on the translation and cultural adaption of an American patient reported experience measures questionnaire, ""Patient Feedback Form"", among Danish patients, and to examine selected psychometric properties within reliability.  Material and methods:   In the first phase of the study, the Patient Feedback Form was forward and backward translated following the methodology of existing guidelines. Subsequently, cognitive interviewing was performed with seven cancer patients and seven healthy persons (19-86 years old/6 men and 8 women) to ensure that questions were easy to understand and made sense to Danish interviewees. In the second phase, phone interviews were carried out with 95 prostate cancer patients after they had responded to the same Patient Feedback Form. Missing data was imputed using the Expectation-Maximization technique. To examine the structure of the questionnaire, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to investigate internal consistency.  Results:   There were only minor disagreements in the translation process, and the reconciliation went smoothly (phase 1). With regard to one item, however, it was difficult to reach a consensus. Through the qualitative validation process, the right solution was found. The results from the psychometric testing (phase 2) showed that four factors had an Eigen value > 1, but only one factor was extracted as the Scree plot had a clear ""elbow"", showing a one factor structure that explained 46.1% of the variance. The internal consistency was high as Cronbach's alpha was 0.89.  Conclusion:   The translated, culturally adapted, and validated version of the Patient Feedback Form seems to be suitable for measuring satisfaction with patient reported outcome measures in a Danish setting. While the results should be treated with caution due to the small sample size, psychometric testing indicates that the questionnaire is a valid instrument. However, additional psychometric testing such as hypotheses testing, responsiveness, and test-retest on a larger and more diverse sample size is required to further verify the validity of the instrument.""","""['Lærke K Tolstrup', 'Helle Pappot', 'Graziella Zangger', 'Lars Bastholt', 'Ann-Dorthe Zwisler', 'Karin B Dieperink']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Health Qual Life Outcomes""","""['A systematic review of the psychometric properties of the cross-cultural translations and adaptations of the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale (MSPSS).', 'A Danish version of the oral health impact profile-14 (OHIP-14): translation and cross-cultural adaptation.', 'Cross-Cultural Translation, Adaptation and Reliability of the Danish M.

However, the role of in vivo cellular cholesterol synthesis in this process is unclear, and data on the transcriptional activity of cholesterol synthesis pathway genes in tissue from prostate cancer patients are inconsistent.  Methods:   A common problem with cancer tissue data from patient cohorts is the presence of heterogeneous tissue which confounds molecular analysis of the samples. In this study we present a general method to minimize systematic confounding from stroma tissue in any prostate cancer cohort comparing prostate cancer and normal samples. In particular we use samples assessed by histopathology to identify genes enriched and depleted in prostate stroma. These genes are then used to assess stroma content in tissue samples from other prostate cancer cohorts where no histopathology is available. Differential expression analysis is performed by comparing cancer and normal samples where the average stroma content has been balanced between the sample groups. In total we analyzed seven patient cohorts with prostate cancer consisting of 1713 prostate cancer and 230 normal tissue samples.  Results:   When stroma confounding was minimized, differential gene expression analysis over all cohorts showed robust and consistent downregulation of nearly all genes in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Additional Gene Ontology analysis also identified cholesterol synthesis as the most significantly altered metabolic pathway in prostate cancer at the transcriptional level.  Conclusion:   The surprising observation that cholesterol synthesis genes are downregulated in prostate cancer is important for our understanding of how prostate cancer cells regulate cholesterol levels in vivo. Moreover, we show that tissue heterogeneity explains the lack of consistency in previous expression analysis of cholesterol synthesis genes in prostate cancer.""","""['Morten Beck Rye', 'Helena Bertilsson', 'Maria K Andersen', 'Kjersti Rise', 'Tone F Bathen', 'Finn Drabløs', 'May-Britt Tessem']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['A Balanced Tissue Composition Reveals New Metabolic and Gene Expression Markers in Prostate Cancer.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate tumor growth and progression through upregulation of cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis.', 'Asporin is a stromally expressed marker associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Caveolin-1 and prostate cancer progression.', 'The reactive stroma microenvironment and prostate cancer progression.', 'Combining Molecular Subtypes with Multivariable Clinical Models Has the Potential to Improve Prediction of Treatment Outcomes in Prostate Cancer at Diagnosis.', 'The genes controlling normal function of citrate and spermine secretion are lost in aggressive prostate cancer and prostate model systems.', 'From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer-Focus on Cholesterol.', 'HMGCR inhibition stabilizes the glycolytic enzyme PKM2 to support the growth of renal cell carcinoma.']"""

Aptamers' ability to bind to proteins with high affinity and specificity, often compared to that of antibodies, enables the search for potential cancer biomarkers and helps us understand the mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The blind spot of those investigations is usually the difficulty in the selective extraction of targets attached to the aptamer. There are many studies describing the cell SELEX for the prime choice of aptamers toward living cancer cells or even whole tumors in the animal models. However, a dilemma arises when a large number of proteins are being identified as potential targets, which is often the case. In this article, we present a new analytical approach designed to selectively target proteins bound to aptamers. During studies, we have focused on the unambiguous identification of the molecular targets of aptamers characterized by high specificity to the prostate cancer cells. We have compared four assay approaches using electrophoretic and chromatographic methods for ""fishing out"" aptamer protein targets followed by mass spectrometry identification. We have established a new methodology, based on the fluorescent-tagged oligonucleotides commonly used for flow-cytometry experiments or as optic aptasensors, that allowed the detection of specific aptamer-protein interactions by mass spectrometry. The use of atto488-labeled aptamers for the tracking of the formation of specific aptamer-target complexes provides the possibility of studying putative protein counterparts without needing to apply enrichment techniques. Significantly, changes in the hydrophobic properties of atto488-labeled aptamer-protein complexes facilitate their separation by reverse-phase chromatography combined with fluorescence detection followed by mass-spectrometry-based protein identification. These comparative results of several methodological approaches confirmed the universal applicability of this method to studying aptamer-protein interactions with high sensitivity, showing superior properties compared with pull-down techniques.""","""['Anna Drabik', 'Joanna Ner-Kluza', 'Przemyslaw Mielczarek', 'Laia Civit', 'Günter Mayer', 'Jerzy Silberring']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Proteome Res""","""['Comparison of whole-cell SELEX methods for the identification of Staphylococcus aureus-specific DNA aptamers.', 'An improved SELEX technique for selection of DNA aptamers binding to M-type 11 of Streptococcus pyogenes.', 'Development of Cell-Specific Aptamers: Recent Advances and Insight into the Selection Procedures.', 'Development of a fraction collection approach in capillary electrophoresis SELEX for aptamer selection.', 'SELEX Modifications and Bioanalytical Techniques for Aptamer-Target Binding Characterization.', 'The Research Advances of Aptamers in Hematologic Malignancies.', 'Aptamer-Based Fluorescent Biosensor for the Rapid and Sensitive Detection of Allergens in Food Matrices.', 'Comparative proteomic analysis provides new insights into regulation of microspore embryogenesis induction in winter triticale (×\u2009Triticosecale Wittm.) after 5-azacytidine treatment.', 'Changes in the Flower and Leaf Proteome of Common Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) under High Temperature.', 'Graphene-Based FRET Aptasensors.']"""

For convenience, it is agreed that a method of analgesia and sedation is necessary. For this purpose, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of inhalation of a 50-50% N2O-O2 gas mixture on pain intensity in these patients.  Material and methods:   Randomized, double-blinded clinical trial, conducted at Antônio Pedro University Hospital (Hospital Universitário Antônio Pedro), Niterói, RJ, Brazil, containing two groups of 42 patients: a control (C) group, which received 100% oxygen inhalation, and a nitrous oxide (NO) group, which received inhalation of the 50-50% N2O-O2 mixture, self-administered during TUSPB. The pain intensity and degree of satisfaction were evaluated through a visual analogue scale (VAS), as was the frequency of adverse events.  Results:   Eighty-four patients were included in the study, with 42 in each group. The mean pain intensity was lower in the NO group than in the C group [2.52 (0-10) vs 5.95 (0-10), p < 0.001], and the degree of satisfaction was higher in the NO group than in the C group (8.14 vs. 4.69, p < 0.001). The adverse effects were somnolence, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, discomfort and euphoria without differences between the groups.

In addition, we evaluated the combination of kinetic parameters from the low- and high-dose injection as a new diagnostic marker.  Materials and methods:   Patients (n = 17) with histologically confirmed PCa underwent preoperative 3 T MRI. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI images were acquired at 8.3-second temporal resolution with a low dose (0.015 mmol/kg) and close to the standard dose (0.085 mmol/kg) of gadobentate dimeglumine bolus injections. Low-dose images were acquired for 3.5 minutes, followed by a 5-minute gap before acquiring standard dose images for 8.3 minutes. The data were analyzed qualitatively to investigate whether lesions could be detected based on early focal enhancement and quantitatively by fitting signal intensity as a function of time with an empirical mathematical model to obtain a maximum enhancement projection (MEP) and signal enhancement rate (α).  Results:   Both low- and standard-dose DCE-MRI showed similar sensitivity (13/26 = 50%) and lesion conspicuity score (4.0 ± 1.0 vs 4.2 ± 0.9; P = 0.317) for PCa diagnosis on qualitative analysis. Prostate cancer showed significantly increased α compared with benign tissue for low (9.98 ± 5.84 vs 5.12 ± 2.95 s) but not for standard (4.27 ± 2.20 vs 3.35 ± 1.48 s) dose. The ratio of low-dose α to standard-dose α was significantly greater (P = 0.02) for PCa (2.8 ± 2.3) than for normal prostate (1.6 ± 0.9), suggesting changes in water exchange and T2* effects associated with cancer. In addition, decreases in the percentage change in T1 relaxation rate as a function of increasing contrast media concentration (ie, the ""saturation effect"") can also contribute to the observed differences in high-dose and low-dose α. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for differentiating PCa from benign tissue using α was higher for low dose (0.769) compared with standard dose (0.625). There were no significant differences between MEP calculated for PCa and normal tissue at the low and standard doses. Moderate significant Pearson correlation for DCE parameters, MEP (r = 0.53) and α (r = 0.58), was found between low and standard doses of GBCA.  Conclusions:   These preliminary results suggest that DCE-MRI with a low GBCA dose distinguishes PCa from benign prostate tissue more effectively than does the standard GBCA dose, based on signal enhancement rate. Diagnostic accuracy is similar on qualitative assessment. Prostate cancer diagnosis may be feasible with DCE-MRI with low-dose GBCA. In addition, comparison of enhancement kinetics after low and high doses of contrast media may provide diagnostically useful information.""","""['Dianning He', 'Aritrick Chatterjee', 'Xiaobing Fan', 'Shiyang Wang', 'Scott Eggener', 'Ambereen Yousuf', 'Tatjana Antic', 'Aytekin Oto', 'Gregory S Karczmar']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['Performance of Ultrafast DCE-MRI for Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of double inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (DIR-MRI) and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in detection of prostate cancer: A pilot study.', 'Effect of Temporal Resolution on Diagnostic Performance of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Update on Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent-Enhanced Imaging in the Genitourinary System.', 'Accuracy of fractal analysis and PI-RADS assessment of prostate magnetic resonance imaging for prediction of cancer grade groups: a clinical validation study.', 'New prostate MRI techniques and sequences.', 'Preliminary study: Breast cancers can be well seen on 3T breast MRI with a half-dose of gadobutrol.', 'Use of Indicator Dilution Principle to Evaluate Accuracy of Arterial Input Function Measured With Low-Dose Ultrafast Prostate Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI.']"""

Materials and methods:   In this prospective study urine from men suspected of having prostate cancer who were scheduled for transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate was collected before digital rectal examination in 99, after digital rectal examination in 58 and from a urethral catheter in 7. Cells were isolated from whole volume voided urine using a filtration device containing a membrane filter with a pore size of 8 μm. Ten additional men provided 4 or 5 urine cell samples by self-collection prior to biopsy. Cellular DNA was analyzed for 5 methylation biomarkers using ddPCR™ (droplet digital polymerase chain reaction).  Results:   Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 117 patients (71%). Across all tumor grades the sensitivity of urine DNA testing was 81% and 60% in samples obtained before and after digital rectal examination, respectively. In a prediction model including prostate specific antigen, patient age and the result of urine DNA analysis to detect high grade disease (Gleason score 7 or greater) an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI 0.90-1.00) was obtained for post-digital rectal examination samples. Analysis of repeat samples demonstrated substantial intraindividual variation in the shedding of cancerous cells in urine.

Materials and methods:   A total of 93 PCA lesions from 44 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were included in this retrospective study. Two radiologists scored every visible lesion with a PI-RADSv2 score of 3, 4, or 5 in each patient's multiparametric MRI examination using PI-RADSv2. A per-lesion one-to-one correlation between MRI-visible lesions and pathologically confirmed PCA lesions was conducted during regular radiology-pathology meetings at our center. The detection rates of clinically significant PCA and the proportions of clinically significant PCAs from MRI-visible and MRI-invisible PCAs were calculated. The performance of PI-RADSv2 for detecting clinically significant PCA was evaluated using the positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the ROC curve (AUC) value.  Results:   Using a PI-RADSv2 score of 3, 4, or 5 as an MRI-visible lesion, 46.88% of clinically significant PCA lesions were detected. The PPV, NPV, and AUC were 96.77%, 45.16%, and 0.72, respectively. Tumor volume and secondary Gleason grade showed a statistically significant difference between MRI-visible and MRI-invisible clinically significant PCAs.  Conclusion:   Multiparametric MRI with PI-RADSv2 missed a considerable number of clinically significant PCA lesions in this per-lesion analysis, causing a relatively low NPV and diagnostic performance compared with previous per-patient studies.

Multivariate analysis indicated that poor cT documentation was associated with older patient age (odds ratio [OR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.99 if 75.1-85 years; OR 0.50, 95%CI 0.36-0.72 if >85 years); diagnosis via transperineal compared to transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS) (OR 0.68, 95%CI 0.51-0.91); diagnosed in a private hospital (OR 0.85, 95%CI 0.75-0.96); and a diagnostic Gleason score of >8 compared to ≤6 (OR 0.59, 95%CI = 0.48-0.73). cT was more likely documented in men diagnosed via transurethral resection of prostate (OR 2.06, 95%CI 1.64-2.58) compared to TRUS and/or if receiving treatment in a radiotherapy center (OR 3.44, 95%CI 2.80-4.23 for external beam radiotherapy; OR 3.57 95%CI 2.44-5.23 for brachytherapy and OR 1.34, 95%CI 1.06-1.69 for combination surgery and radiotherapy) compared to those undergoing radical prostatectomy.

ADT is associated with changes in mood, cognition, and quality of life, and most recently with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study examined changes in brain metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) in men undergoing intermittent ADT.  Methods:   Nine men with prostate cancer and a rising PSA (biochemical recurrence) without evidence of metastases were treated with intermittent ADT consisting of 9 months of complete androgen blockade achieved with combined leuprolide acetate and flutamide. Patients underwent resting [Fuorine-18] fluorodeoxyglucose PET (18F-FDGPET) at baseline (before treatment) and again after 9 months of ADT.  Results:   Whole-brain mapping analysis after 9 months of androgen deprivation compared to pretreatment baseline revealed decreased regional cerebral glucose metabolism in the cerebellum, posterior cingulate, and medial thalamus bilaterally. Associations of brain metabolism with measurements of cognition and mood while on androgen deprivation revealed positive correlations between the posterior cingulate, left inferior parietal lobule (BA40), and left mid temporal gyrus (BA39) and spatial reasoning and a negative correlation between left inferior parietal lobule and verbal memory. Several mood indices were negatively correlated with hypothalamus and brainstem.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that complete androgen deprivation may result in changes in regional brain metabolism associated with variation in mood, verbal memory, and spatial performance. Brain regions that were impacted from ADT are similar and overlap with brain regions with metabolic decline found in early AD and diabetes, suggesting possible common mechanisms.""","""['M M Cherrier', 'D J Cross', 'C S Higano', 'S Minoshima']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Cognitive and mood changes in men undergoing intermittent combined androgen blockade for non-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

No large studies have investigated the clinical and biochemical parameters associated with liver metastases in this population.  Materials and methods:   Patient data made available via Project Data Sphere were collected from 1,281 men with mCRPC who were enrolled on to three phase III clinical trials for the treatment of their disease. Multiple logistic regression was performed on eight clinical and biochemical baseline variables to test their association with the presence of liver metastases on baseline radiographic imaging. Variables of interest included prior docetaxel exposure, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase (AST), hemoglobin (HGB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), prostate-specific antigen, and total bilirubin. Final models were compared when treating the variables as either continuous or categorized.  Results:   Multiple variable analysis demonstrated that an increasing serum AST or LDH or a decreasing HGB was associated with an increased probability of having documented radiographic liver metastases (p < .0001). The area under the curve for the continuous model was 0.6842 and 0.6890 for the categorical one, with the latter model containing a dichotomized AST and LDH based on the upper limit of normal and tertile ranges of HGB based on the distribution of the outcome.  Conclusion:   Our analysis demonstrated a significant association between the presence of liver metastases and laboratory levels of AST, LDH, and HGB. These have implications for patient management. More research is needed to validate these biomarkers and prospectively determine their application in the clinical setting.  Implications for practice:   The purpose of this study was to evaluate biochemical and clinical biomarkers associated with the presence of liver metastases in men diagnosed with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The results indicate that quantitative assessments of aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, and hemoglobin are significantly associated with an increased probability of having documented radiographic liver metastases. Analysis of these simple variables can alert clinicians to those at high risk for prostate cancer that has spread to the liver, a finding of clear importance for clinical management.""","""['Patrick M Cotogno', 'Lahiru K Ranasinghe', 'Elisa M Ledet', 'Brian E Lewis', 'Oliver Sartor']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Relationship between serum markers and volume of liver metastases in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dynamic changes of alkaline phosphatase are strongly associated with PSA-decline and predict best clinical benefit earlier than PSA-changes under therapy with abiraterone acetate in bone metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Meta-Analysis Evaluating the Impact of Site of Metastasis on Overall Survival in Men With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical phenotypes associated with circulating tumor cell enumeration in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Alkaline phosphatase in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: reassessment of an older biomarker.', 'Liver Microenvironment Response to Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Hormonal Therapy.', 'Clinical Significance of Transient Asymptomatic Elevations in Aminotransferase (TAEAT) in Oncology.', 'Incidence of Elevated Aminotransferases With or Without Bilirubin Elevation During Treatment With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Retrospective Study of Patients From Community Oncology Clinics in the United States.', 'The homogeneity and heterogeneity of occurrence, characteristics, and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with synchronous and metachronous bone metastasis.', 'Higher Serum Levels of Lactate Dehydrogenase Before Microsurgery Predict Poor Outcome of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.']"""

However, most of these studies were small, and questions remain regarding this association's strength and whether it persists after adjustment for stage and Gleason score.Methods: This analysis included men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between enrollment in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort in 1992-1993 and June 2013. Cigarette smoking was self-reported at enrollment and updated in 1997 and every 2 years thereafter. Analyses of pre-diagnosis and post-diagnosis smoking included 9,781 and 9,111 prostate cancer cases, respectively, with vital status follow-up through 2014.Results: There were 672 deaths from prostate cancer in analyses of pre-diagnosis smoking and 554 in analyses of post-diagnosis smoking. In multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models including stage and Gleason score, both current smoking before diagnosis [HR = 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-2.13] and current smoking after diagnosis (HR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.09-2.67) were associated with higher PCSM compared to never smoking. Prostate cancer survivors who quit smoking <20 years before diagnosis were also at significantly higher risk of PCSM (HR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.61).Conclusions: This large prospective study suggests that current smoking both before and after diagnosis of prostate cancer is associated with higher PCSM, even after accounting for stage and Gleason score.Impact: Our results provide evidence that smoking is a relevant prognostic factor for prostate cancer patients and that prostate cancer may be among the causes of death attributable to smoking.

Although the androgen receptor (AR) has been associated with therapy failure, the mechanisms underlying this failure have not been elucidated. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and its interaction with AR play a major role in acquisition of enzalutamide resistance. To validate the finding, we show upregulation of β-catenin and AR in enzalutamide-resistant cells, partially due to reduction of β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination. Although activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in enzalutamide-sensitive cells led to drug resistance, combination of β-catenin inhibitor ICG001 with enzalutamide inhibited expression of stem-like markers, cell proliferation, and tumor growth synergistically in various models. Analysis of clinical datasets revealed a molecule pattern shift in different stages of prostate cancer, where we detected a significant correlation between AR and β-catenin expression. These data identify activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a major mechanism contributing to enzalutamide resistance and demonstrate the potential to stratify patients with high risk of said resistance.Significance: Wnt/β-catenin inhibition resensitizes prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide.

Here, we show that ZIKV is also capable of infecting and destroying stem-like cancer cells from aggressive human embryonal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). When evaluating the oncolytic properties of Brazilian Zika virus strain (ZIKVBR) against human breast, prostate, colorectal, and embryonal CNS tumor cell lines, we verified a selective infection of CNS tumor cells followed by massive tumor cell death. ZIKVBR was more efficient in destroying embryonal CNS tumorspheres than normal stem cell neurospheres. A single intracerebroventricular injection of ZIKVBR in BALB/c nude mice bearing orthotopic human embryonal CNS tumor xenografts resulted in a significantly longer survival, decreased tumor burden, fewer metastasis, and complete remission in some animals. Tumor cells closely resembling neural stem cells at the molecular level with activated Wnt signaling were more susceptible to the oncolytic effects of ZIKVBR Furthermore, modulation of Wnt signaling pathway significantly affected ZIKVBR-induced tumor cell death and viral shedding. Altogether, these preclinical findings indicate that ZIKVBR could be an efficient agent to treat aggressive forms of embryonal CNS tumors and could provide mechanistic insights regarding its oncolytic effects.Significance: Brazilian Zika virus strain kills aggressive metastatic forms of human CNS tumors and could be a potential oncolytic agent for cancer therapy.

Additionally, sensitivity analyses of organ doses for various beam parameters and phantom sizes were performed.  Methods:   Because the CIRT out-of-field dose depends on the beam parameters, the typical values of those parameters were determined from statistical data on the target properties of patients who received CIRT at the Heavy-Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). Using these typical beam-parameter values, out-of-field organ dose equivalents during CIRT for typical prostate treatment were estimated by Monte Carlo simulations using the Particle and Heavy-Ion Transport Code System (PHITS) and the ICRP reference phantom.  Results:   The results showed that the dose decreased with distance from the target, ranging from 116 mSv in the testes to 7 mSv in the brain. The organ dose equivalents per treatment dose were lower than those either in 6-MV intensity-modulated radiotherapy or in brachytherapy with an Ir-192 source for organs within 40 cm of the target. Sensitivity analyses established that the differences from typical values were within ∼30% for all organs, except the sigmoid colon.  Conclusions:   The typical out-of-field organ dose equivalents during passive-beam CIRT were shown. The low sensitivity of the dose equivalent in organs farther than 20 cm from the target indicated that individual dose assessments required for retrospective epidemiological studies may be limited to organs around the target in cases of passive-beam CIRT for prostate cancer.""","""['Shunsuke Yonai', 'Naruhiro Matsufuji', 'Keiichi Akahane']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Monte Carlo study of out-of-field exposure in carbon-ion radiotherapy: Organ doses in pediatric brain tumor treatment.', 'Calculation of out-of-field dose distribution in carbon-ion radiotherapy by Monte Carlo simulation.', 'Calculated organ doses using Monte Carlo simulations in a reference male phantom undergoing HDR brachytherapy applied to localized prostate carcinoma.', 'Proton Beam Therapy and Carbon Ion Radiotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Clinical evidence of particle beam therapy (carbon).', 'Medical application of particle and heavy ion transport code system PHITS.', 'Long-term clinical outcomes after 12-fractionated carbon-ion radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Effect of protective glasses on radiation dose to eye lenses during whole breast irradiation.', 'Carbon Ion Therapy: A Modern Review of an Emerging Technology.']"""

However, there is a lack of response predictive biomarkers.  Objective:   To assess lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a docetaxel response biomarker in mCRPC and to examine the association of LDH with genomic alterations in primary diagnostic biopsies.  Design, setting, and participants:   Clinical and associated primary tumour-targeted next-generation sequencing data from matched training (n=150) and test (n=120) cohorts of progressive mCRPC patients receiving docetaxel therapy were analysed. Data were correlated with large-scale prostate cancer genomic datasets.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, radiographic response, biochemical progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), genomic analysis of primary biopsies, and genomic datasets (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC] and SU2C/PCF).  Results and limitations:   Serum LDH ≥450U/l is a reliable prognostic biomarker (area under the curve: 0.757 [standard deviation 0.054, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.650-0.864, p<0.001]) in progressive mCRPC, predicting PFS at 3 mo. Patients with LDH ≥450U/l were poorer PSA responders, with shorter PFS (213 vs 372 d, hazard ratio [HR] 1.876, 95% CI 1.289-2.7300) and OS (362 vs 563 d, HR 1.630, 95% CI 1.127-2.357). High LDH is an independent surrogate marker for survival following docetaxel and predicts a poor radiological response (p=0.043). Of the 14 patients with LDH ≥450U/l available for next-generation sequencing, nine (64.3%) were more likely to have DNA repair gene mutation(s) (BRCA1/2, ATM, CHEK2, Fanconi anaemia gene) in their primary biopsy. Cross correlation with MSKCC and SU2C/PCF databases revealed a positive correlation between LDHA, PARP1 (r=0.667, p<0.01), and other DNA repair genes.  Conclusions:   Genomic abnormalities of LDHA and DNA repair in primary biopsies link to high pretreatment LDH and poor response to docetaxel in mCRPC.

Emerging evidence indicates that downregulation of TGFBR2, a pivotal regulator of TGF-β signaling, may contribute to carcinogenesis and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the biological function and regulatory mechanism of TGFBR2 in PCa remain poorly understood. In this study, we propose to investigate the crosstalk of hypoxia and TGF-β signaling and provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the regulatory pathways in PCa.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cell lines were cultured in hypoxia or normoxia to evaluate the effect of hypoxia on TGFBR2 expression. Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and demethylation agents was used to evaluate the methylation regulation of TGFBR2 promoter. Besides, silencing of EZH2 via specific siRNAs or chemical inhibitor was used to validate the regulatory effect of EZH2 on TGFBR2. Moreover, we conducted PCR, western blot, and luciferase assays which studied the relationship of miR-93 and TGFBR2 in PCa cell lines and specimens. We also detected the impacts of hypoxia on EZH2 and miR-93, and further examined the tumorigenic functions of miR-93 on proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition via a series of experiments.  Results:   TGFBR2 expression was attenuated under hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced EZH2 promoted H3K27me3 which caused TGFBR2 promoter hypermethylation and contributed to its epigenetic silencing in PCa. Besides, miR-93 was significantly upregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines, and negatively correlated with the expression of TGFBR2. Ectopic expression of miR-93 promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion in PCa, and its expression could also be induced by hypoxia. In addition, TGFBR2 was identified as a bona fide target of miR-93.  Conclusions:   Our findings elucidate diverse hypoxia-regulated pathways including EZH2-mediated hypermethylation and miR-93-induced silencing contribute to attenuation of TGFBR2 expression and promote cancer progression in prostate cancer.""","""['Hui Zhou', 'Guanqing Wu', 'Xueyou Ma', 'Jun Xiao', 'Gan Yu', 'Chunguang Yang', 'Nan Xu', 'Bao Zhang', 'Jun Zhou', 'Zhangqun Ye', 'Zhihua Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'Loss of TGF-β signaling in osteoblasts increases basic-FGF and promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in prostate cancer: A dual function mediator?', 'Chemokines and cytokines: Axis and allies in prostate cancer pathogenesis.', 'Down-regulation of hepatic expression of GHR/STAT5/IGF-1 signaling pathway fosters development and aggressiveness of HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma: Crosstalk with Snail-1 and type 2 transforming growth factor-beta receptor.', 'The Upregulation of HAS2-AS1 Relates to the Granulosa Cell Dysfunction by Repressing TGF-β Signaling and Upregulating HAS2.', 'The Role of Mitochondrial Metabolism, AMPK-SIRT Mediated Pathway, LncRNA and MicroRNA in Osteoarthritis.', 'Hypoxia as a Modulator of Inflammation and Immune Response in Cancer.', 'ADAMTS9-AS1 Constrains Breast Cancer Cell Invasion and Proliferation via Sequestering miR-301b-3p.']"""

Despite screening availability, research reveals conflicting results on medical outcomes, for example, disease specific mortality. However the gold standard in early diagnosis of potentially curable organ confined prostate cancer is transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic prostate biopsy (TRUS-BX). While focus has been given to medical sequalae there is a paucity of research on the psychological impact of biopsy. Awaiting biopsy may be inherently stressful but no studies to date, have assessed men's perception of stress and its impact on emotional response. This study, therefore, examines the role of stress and also personal resources namely, self-efficacy and sense of coherence in emotional adjustment in men awaiting a prostate biopsy.  Methods:   Men attending a Rapid Access Prostate Cancer Clinic for a transrectal prostate biopsy (N = 114) participated in the study. They completed self report questionnaires on perceived stress (PSS), generalised self-efficacy (GSES), and sense of coherence (SOC). Adjustment was measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS-B) which assesses tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion and vigour.  Results:   Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that the set of predictors accounted for 17%-34% of variance across six mood states and predicted 46% of total mood disturbance. Perceived stress explained variance on all domains (11%-26%) with high stress linked to poor functioning.  Conclusion:   Perceived stress was the strongest and most consistent predictor of emotional adjustment. This is an important finding as stress appraisal has not been examined previously in this context and suggests that stress management is an important target to enhance emotional wellbeing of men attending for a prostate biopsy.""","""['AnnMarie Groarke', 'Ruth Curtis', 'Deirdre M J Walsh', 'Francis J Sullivan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Quality of life and adjustment in men with prostate cancer: Interplay of stress, threat and resilience.', 'Stress and self-efficacy predict psychological adjustment at diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The measurement of psychological distress in men being investigated for the presence of prostate cancer.', 'Transrectal ultrasound-guided punch biopsies of the prostate.

In our recent study we have demonstrated that excess levels of XPO5 enhanced the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Similarly, there are studies to support the inhibitory role of XPO5 in cancers. In order to evaluate discrepancies in the expression levels of XPO5 in differential tumor types, we quantified the expression of XPO5 using gene expression RNA-seq data for several tumor types which were independently confirmed by immunohistochemistry in multiple organs cancer tissue microarray (TMAs) experiment. We found that while some tumors (Breast, Bladder, Lymph-node, Lung, Esophagus and Ovary) showed higher differences between normal and malignant tumors in XPO5 expression, there were tissues (Kidney and Brain) that have a significantly lower XPO5 expression in malignant tumors. We further studies these observations of overexpression and down-regulation of XPO5 in breast and kidney cancer cell lines and found that XPO5 might have a dual role in promoting or inhibiting tumor growth in different cancer tissue types.""","""['Munazza Khan', 'Zafaruddin Khan', 'Yaser Uddin', 'Sadaf Mustafa', 'Irfan Shaukat', 'Jianbo Pan', 'Naseruddin Höti']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Overexpression of Exportin-5 Overrides the Inhibitory Effect of miRNAs Regulation Control and Stabilize Proteins via Posttranslation Modifications in Prostate Cancer.', 'Induction of exportin-5 expression during melanoma development supports the cellular behavior of human malignant melanoma cells.', 'Exportin-5 Functions as an Oncogene and a Potential Therapeutic Target in Colorectal Cancer.', 'XPO5 genetic polymorphisms in cancer risk and prognosis.', 'OncomiR or Tumor Suppressor?

This changing landscape has renewed interest in the concept “disease volume”, the focus of the present study is the Egyptian patients. Methods: Patients with hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer presenting at Menoufia University Hospital, Egypt, during the period from June 2013 to May 2016, were enrolled. All received hormonal treatment. Radiologic images were evaluated and patients were stratified according to their disease volume into high or low, other clinical and pathological data that could affect survival also being collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 128 patients were included, with a median age of 70 years (53.9% ≥70). About 46% had co-morbidities, 62% having high volume disease. During the median follow up period of 28 months about half of the patients progressed and one third received chemotherapy. On univariate analysis, disease volume, performance status (PS), prostate specific antigen level (PSA) and presence of pain at presentation were identified as factors influencing overall survival. Multivariate analysis revealed the independent predictor factors for survival to be PS, PSA and disease volume. The median overall survival with 27 months was high volume versus 49 with low volume disease (hazard ratio 2.1; 95% CI 1.2 - 4.4; P=0.02). Median progression free survival was 19 months in the high volume, as compared with 48 months in the low volume disease patients (hazard ratio, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.42 – 7.4; P=0.009). Conclusions: Disease volume is a reliable predictor of survival which should be incorporated with other important factors as; patient performance status and comorbidities in treatment decision-making.""","""['Alshimaa Mahmoud Alhanafy', 'Fouad Zanaty', 'Reda Ibrahem', 'Suzan Omar']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Testosterone Reduction of\xa0≥ 480 ng/dL Predicts Favorable Prognosis of Japanese Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer Treated With Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Impact of pretreatment factors, biopsy Gleason grade volume indices and post-treatment nadir PSA on overall survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated with step-up hormonal therapy.', 'Prostate-cancer-specific survival and clinical progression-free survival in men with prostate cancer treated intermittently with testosterone-inactivating pharmaceuticals.', 'Pretreatment of metastatic disease.
