Methods:   This randomized controlled double-blind study included 246 cases of Qi-deficiency blood-stasis type of prostate cancer after castration, which were randomly divided into an experiment and a control group of equal number to be treated with Qilan Capsules + androgen-deprivation and placebo + androgen-deprivation, respectively. After 6 months of treatment, we compared the International Prostate Symptoms Scores (IPSS), TCM Symptoms Scores (TCMSS), maximal urine flow rate (Qmax), and the level of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) between the two groups of patients.  Results:   Statistically significant differences were observed between the experiment and control groups in the syndrome classification-based efficacy (87.7% vs 67.9%, P <0.05) and total effectiveness rate (86.0% vs 71.6%, P <0.05). Compared with the baseline, the experiment group showed remarkable improvement after treatment in TCMSS (17.1±5.1 vs 8.3±4.0, P <0.05), IPSS (17.7±7.5 vs 11.4±4.6, P <0.05), and Qmax (［10.9±4.3］ ml/s vs ［14.7±3.7］ ml/s, P <0.05), and so did the control group (16.8±5.2 vs 11.5±5.2, 17.8±6.7 vs 14.6±5.8, and ［11.0±4.3］ ml/s vs ［12.0±4.1］ ml/s, P <0.05). The above three parameters were even more markedly improved in the former than in the latter group (P <0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the improvement of the PSA level after treatment (P >0.05).  Conclusions:   Qilan Capsules can significantly enhance the effect of androgen-deprivation therapy in the treatment of Qi-deficiency blood-stasis type of prostate cancer after castration though cannot obviously improve the PSA level.""","""['De-Gui Chang', 'Xiang Li', 'Jian-Hua Zou', 'Xu-Jun Yu', 'Xiao-Fang Pan', 'Tian-Lang Wu', 'Guang-Sen Li', 'Wen-Ying Chen', 'Cheng Chen']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue""","""[""Huang'e Capsules for BPH of the qi-deficiency blood-stasis and damp-heat stagnation type: An open-label single-arm multicenter phase-Ⅳ clinical study."", 'Longbishu Capsule combined with mesylate doxazosin: an efficacious therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Chemotherapy combined with androgen-deprivation therapy in high-volume metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a short-term efficacy and safety analysis.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Methods:   Sixty-six cases of prostate cancer were included in this study, 35 with and 31 without biochemical recurrence within two years postoperatively, and another 31 healthy individuals were enrolled as normal controls. The relative expression levels of circulating miR-152 in the serum of the subjects were detected by qRT-PCR, its value in the early diagnosis of postoperative biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer was assessed by ROC curve analysis, and the correlation of its expression level with the clinicopathological parameters of the patients were analyzed.  Results:   The expression of circulating miR-152 was significantly lower in the serum of the prostate cancer patients than in the normal controls (t = －5.212, P = 0.001), and so was it in the patients with than in those without postoperative biochemical recurrence (t = －5.727, P = 0.001). The ROC curve for the value of miR-152 in the early prediction of postoperative biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer showed the area under the curve (AUC) to be 0.906 (95% CI: 0.809－0.964), with a sensitivity of 91.4% and a specificity of 80.6%. The expression level of miR-152 was correlated with the Gleason score, clinical stage of prostate cancer, biochemical recurrence, and bone metastasis (P <0.05), decreasing with increased Gleason scores and elevated clinical stage of the malignancy. No correlation, however, was found between the miR-152 expression and the patients' age or preoperative PSA level (P >0.05).

Methods:   Human prostate cancer LNCaP-AI cells were transfected with siRNA targeting the PTTG1 gene using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. The proliferation, invasiveness and apoptosis of the cells were detected by MTT, Transwell assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The protein expressions of PTTG1, p-Akt, and p-ERK were determined by Western blot and the mRNA expression of PTTG1 measured by agarose gel electrophoresis.  Results:   The siRNA expression vector markedly down-regulated the expression of PTTG1, which effectively suppressed the proliferation of the LNCaP-AI cells, with the inhibition rates of (19.47 ± 2.12), (24.01 ± 2.13) and (48.02 ± 2.22)% at 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively, after transfection, with statistically significant differences among the three groups (P <0.05). The number of the cells passing through the polycarbonate film was remarkably decreased at 24, 48 and 72 hours (74.67 ± 9.85, 56.44 ± 8.66 and 37.33 ± 6.14) as compared with the baseline (111.11 ± 13.47) (P <0.01), while the apoptosis rate of the cells was significantly increased at 24, 48 and 72 hours (18.32 ± 0.94), (19.94 ± 1.30) and (21.73 ± 1.88)% in comparison with the baseline (［2.17 ± 0.49］%)， (P <0.05). PTTG1 siRNA combined with androgen antagonist flumatide exhibited even more significant effects in inhibiting the proliferation and promoting the apoptosis of the LNCaP-AI cells than either used alone, and in a flumatide dose-dependent manner. The inhibition and apoptosis rates of the LNCaP-AI cells treated with 50 nmol/L flumatide were (27.13 ± 3.52) and (3.94 ± 0.48)%, and those treated with siRNA + 50 nmol/L flumatide were (67.51 ± 5.13) and (19.93 ± 1.72)%, respectively, both with statistically significant differences between the two groups (P <0.05). The inhibition and apoptosis rates of the cells treated with 100 nmol/L flumatide were (43.72 ± 3.90) and (5.33 ± 0.66)%, and those treated with siRNA + 100 nmol/L flumatide were (73.19 ± 4.78) and (23.43 ± 1.76)%, respectively, both with statistically significant differences between the two groups (P <0.05).  Conclusions:   The siRNA expression vector can down-regulate the expression of PTTG1, which can inhibit the proliferation and invasiveness of LNCaP-AI cells, promote their apoptosis, and increase their sensibility to androgen antagonists.

Randomized trials have demonstrated that early detection reduces the incidence of de novo metastatic PCa. Concurrently, life-prolonging treatments have been introduced for patients with advanced PCa. On a populations-based level, the authors analyzed whether early detection and improved treatments changed the incidence and 5-year mortality of men with de novo metastatic PCa.  Methods:   Men diagnosed with PCa during the periods 1980 to 2011 and 1995 to 2011 were identified in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and the Danish Prostate Cancer Registry (DaPCaR), respectively, and stratified according to period of diagnosis. Age-standardized incidence rates were calculated. Five-year mortality rates for de novo metastatic PCa were analyzed using competing risk analysis.  Results:   Totals of 426,266 and 47,024 men were identified in SEER and DaPCaR, respectively. Of these, 29,555 and 6874 had de novo metastatic PCa. The incidence of de novo metastatic PCa decreased (from 12.0 to 4.4 per 100,000 men) in the SEER cohort (1980-2011), whereas it increased (from 6.7 to 9.9 per 100,000 men) in the DaPCaR cohort (1995-2011). Five-year PCa mortality in the SEER cohort was stable for men diagnosed with de novo metastatic PCa from 1980 to 1994 and increased slightly in the latest periods studied (P < .0001), whereas it decreased by 16.6% (P < .0001) in the DaPCaR cohort.  Conclusions:   Despite earlier detection, de novo metastatic PCa remains associated with a high risk of 5-year disease-specific mortality. The reduced 5-year PCa mortality in the Danish cohort is largely explained by lead-time. Early detection strategies do indeed decrease the incidence of de novo metastatic PCa, as observed in the SEER cohort. This achievement, however, must be weighed against the unsolved issue of overdetection and overtreatment of indolent PCa.

An imbalance in concentrations of calcium and magnesium has been associated with multiple chronic diseases, although few studies have examined the relation with prostate cancer aggressiveness.  Objective:   The goal of this study was to examine the association between dietary intakes of calcium and magnesium, the calcium-to-magnesium ratio (Ca:Mg), and dairy products and prostate cancer aggressiveness.  Design:   Dietary intake was assessed with the use of an interviewer-administered modified National Cancer Institute Diet History Questionnaire in 996 African American and 1064 European American men with a recent histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer from the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP). High-aggressive disease was defined as Gleason sum ≥8, or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >20 ng/mL, or Gleason score ≥7 and clinical stage T3-T4. The comparison group was all other prostate cancer cases. Logistic regression was used to determine the adjusted ORs and 95% CIs for high-aggressive prostate cancer by tertile of diet and supplement exposures.  Results:   There was a positive association across tertiles of dietary Ca:Mg intake, with odds of high-aggressive prostate cancer in the upper tertiles as follows-OR for tertile 2 compared with tertile 1: 1.38 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.88); OR for tertile 3 compared with tertile 1: 1.46 (95% CI: 1.06, 2.02). When stratified by race, the positive association was more pronounced in African American men (OR for tertile 3 compared with tertile 2: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.53). Men who reported the highest daily consumption of whole-fat milk had a 74% increased odds of high-aggressive prostate cancer compared with non-whole-fat milk drinkers, which was attenuated after adjustment for potential mediating factors, such as saturated fat and Ca:Mg intake.  Conclusions:   Among both African American and European American men diagnosed with prostate cancer, a higher Ca:Mg and whole-milk intake were associated with higher odds of high-aggressive prostate cancer.

The CHHiP (Conventional or Hypofractionated High Dose Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer) trial provides a large, prospectively collected, contemporary dataset in which to explore outcomes by age.  Methods and materials:   CHHiP participants received 3 to 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 74 Gy in 37 fractions (conventional fractionation), 60 Gy in 20 fractions, or 57 Gy in 19 fractions. Toxicity was assessed using clinician-reported outcome (CRO) and patient-reported outcome questionnaires. Participants were categorized as aged < 75 years or ≥ 75 years. Outcomes were compared by age group.  Results:   Of 3216 patients, 491 (15%) were aged ≥ 75 years. There was no difference in biochemical or clinical failure rates between the groups aged < 75 years and ≥ 75 years for any of the fractionation schedules. In the group aged ≥ 75 years, biochemical or clinical failure-free rates favored hypofractionation, and at 5 years, they were 84.7% for 74 Gy, 91% for 60 Gy, and 87.7% for 57 Gy. The incidence of CRO (grade 3) acute bowel toxicity was 2% in both age groups. The incidence of grade 3 acute bladder toxicity was 8% in patients aged < 75 years and 7% in those aged ≥ 75 years. The 5-year cumulative incidence of CRO grade ≥ 2 late bowel side effects was similar in both age groups. However, in the group aged ≥ 75 years, there was a suggestion of a higher cumulative incidence of bowel bother (small or greater) with 60 Gy compared with 74 Gy and 57 Gy. Patient-reported bladder bother was slightly higher in the group aged ≥ 75 years than the group aged < 75 years, and there was a suggestion of a lower cumulative incidence of bladder bother with 57 Gy compared with 74 Gy and 60 Gy in patients aged ≥ 75 years, which was not evident in those aged < 75 years.  Conclusions:   Hypofractionated radiation therapy appears to be well tolerated and effective in men aged ≥ 75 years.

It is mandatory to have a very accurate staging to choice the best possible treatment.  Aims:   To test the possibility of improving the performance of Partin's tables in predicting the pathological staging of PC by introducing bioptic parameters through an innovative statistic tool (Fagan's two-step nomogram).  Methods:   We prospectivelly collected data of all 1048 consecutive patients undergoing saturation 24-core transrectal prostate biopsy. Then, in eligible 94 patients, we compared the prediction of presence/absence of extracapsular extension of neoplasm (EPE+/-), with pathological assessment of invasion through (pseudo)capsule in the prostatectomy specimens. Starting from the probability of EPE- (pre-test probability, calculated with formula ""100%-risk of EPE+""), we used Fagan's nomogram to examine the diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) of negative ""lateral"" bioptic cores.  Results:   We specifically analyzed the status of ""lateral"" cores in each side (94 patients × 2 sides = 188 sides). ""Lateral"" cores were negative in 42.5% of sides (80/188) with a DSe and DSp of 91.7 and 45.4%, respectively. In these sides, the mean probability of EPE+ according to Partin's tables was 21.6%. With Fagan's nomogram, the post-test probability of EPE+ when all ""lateral"" cores were negative was 14.1%, with a substantial gain of 7.5%.  Discussion:   The spatial distribution of bioptic positive cores allowed us to demonstrate the role Fagan's nomogram in increasing the accuracy of already existing, predictive tools for PC.

Autophagy is an event occurring in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic LC3 puncta formation is a hallmark of autophagy. Graphene oxide (GO) is a nanomaterial that provokes autophagy in CT26 colon cancer cells and confers antitumor effects. Here we aimed to evaluate whether combined use of GO with CDDP (GO/CDDP) overcomes chemoresistance in different cancer cells and uncover the underlying mechanism. Methods: We treated different cancer cells with GO/CDDP and evaluated the cytotoxicity, death mechanism, autophagy induction and nuclear entry of CDDP. We further knocked down genes essential for autophagic flux and deciphered which step is critical to nuclear import and cell death. Finally, we performed immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence labeling to evaluate the association of LC3 and CDDP. Results: We uncovered that combination of GO and CDDP (GO/CDDP) promoted the killing of not only CT26 cells, but also ovarian, cervical and prostate cancer cells. In the highly chemosensitized Skov-3 cells, GO/CDDP significantly enhanced concurrent nuclear import of CDDP and autophagy marker LC3 and elevated cell necrosis, which required autophagy initiation and progression but did not necessitate late autophagy events (e.g., autophagosome completion and autolysosome formation). The GO/CDDP-elicited nuclear trafficking and cell death also required importin α/β, and LC3 also co-migrated with CDDP and histone H1/H4 into the nucleus. In particular, GO/CDDP triggered histone H4 acetylation in the nucleus, which could decondense the chromosome and enable CDDP to more effectively access chromosomal DNA to trigger cell death. Conclusion: These findings shed light on the mechanisms of GO/CDDP-induced chemosensitization and implicate the potential applications of GO/CDDP to treat multiple cancers.""","""['Kuan-Chen Lin', 'Mei-Wei Lin', 'Mu-Nung Hsu', 'Guan Yu-Chen', 'Yu-Chan Chao', 'Hsing-Yu Tuan', 'Chi-Shiun Chiang', 'Yu-Chen Hu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Graphene oxide as a chemosensitizer: diverted autophagic flux, enhanced nuclear import, elevated necrosis and improved antitumor effects.', 'Graphene oxide triggers toll-like receptors/autophagy responses in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo.', 'Mechanisms of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy involved in graphene oxide nanomaterial anti-osteosarcoma effect.', 'Autophagy modulating agents as chemosensitizers for cisplatin therapy in cancer.', 'Inhibiting autophagy to prevent drug resistance and improve anti-tumor therapy.', 'The Exploitation of Lysosomes in Cancer Therapy with Graphene-Based Nanomaterials.', 'Recognition motifs for importin 4 (L)PPRS(G/P)P and importin 5 KP(K/Y)LV binding, identified by bio-informatic simulation and experimental in vitro validation.', 'Nanotherapeutics in autophagy: a paradigm shift in cancer treatment.', 'Extracellular vesicles in ovarian cancer chemoresistance, metastasis, and immune evasion.', 'A convergent synthetic platform for dual anticancer drugs functionalized by reduced graphene nanocomposite delivery for hepatocellular cancer.']"""

However, an easy to use, reliable imaging method for assessment of tumor oxygenation in routine clinical practice remains elusive. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a relatively new imaging technique that utilizes a combination of light and ultrasound (US) to enable functional imaging of tumor hemodynamic characteristics in vivo. Several clinical trials are currently evaluating the utility of PAI in cancer detection for breast, thyroid, and prostate cancer. Here, we evaluated the potential of PAI for rapid, label-free, non-invasive quantification of tumor oxygenation as a biomarker of radiation response in head and neck cancer. Methods: Studies were performed human papilloma virus- positive (HPV+) and -negative (HPV-) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). PAI was utilized for longitudinal assessment of tumor hemodynamics (oxygenation saturation and hemoglobin concentration) before, during and after fractionated radiation therapy (fRT). Imaging datasets were correlated with histologic measures of vascularity (CD31), DNA damage (phosphorylated γH2AX) and statistical modeling of tumor growth. Results: A differential response to fRT was observed between HPV+ and HPV- xenografts. Temporal changes in tumor hemodynamics (oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration) measured by PAI showed significant association with treatment outcomes. PAI-based changes in oxygen saturation were detected within days after initiation of fRT prior to detectable change in tumor volume, highlighting the potential of PAI to serve as an early biomarker of therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with PAI results, immunohistochemical staining of vascularity (CD31) and DNA damage (phosphorylated γH2AX) revealed distinct patterns of response in HPV+ and HPV- xenografts. Conclusion: Collectively, our observations demonstrate the utility of PAI for temporal mapping of tumor hemodynamics and the value of PAI read-outs as surrogate measures of radiation response in HNSCC.""","""['Laurie J Rich', 'Austin Miller', 'Anurag K Singh', 'Mukund Seshadri']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Visualizing the effects of metformin on tumor growth, vascularity, and metabolism in head and neck cancer.', 'Photoacoustic monitoring of tumor and normal tissue response to radiation.', 'Effect of radiation on cell proliferation and tumor hypoxia in HPV-positive head and neck cancer in vivo models.', 'MicroRNAs as new biomarkers for human papilloma virus related head and neck cancers.', 'The role of Human papillomavirus in head and neck cancer and the impact on radiotherapy outcome.', 'Deep learning based on co-registered ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging improves the assessment of rectal cancer treatment response.', 'Simultaneous Probing of Metabolism and Oxygenation of Tumors In Vivo Using FLIM of NAD(P)H and PLIM of a New Polymeric Ir(III) Oxygen Sensor.', '3D Ultrasound-Guided Photoacoustic Imaging to Monitor the Effects of Suboptimal Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy in Pancreatic Tumors.', 'Photoacoustic imaging provides an in vivo assessment of the preeclamptic placenta remodeling and function in response to therapy.', 'Diagnostics of HNSCC Patients: An Analysis of Cell Lines and Patient-Derived Xenograft Models for Personalized Therapeutical Medicine.']"""

Methods:   Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) 10% data between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2014 was utilised in this retrospective cohort study. Men who had received their first androgen deprivation therapy between 2004 and 2010 were selected as the prostate cancer cohort.

Comparisons were made between the prostate cancer cohort and specific control groups (age-matched and sex-matched without any dispensing of anti-neoplastic agents during the study period and without the individual comorbidity of interest evaluated at baseline at 1:10 ratio) for the development of nine individual comorbidities over time using Cox regression models.  Results:   The prostate cancer cohort had a significant higher risk of developing cardiovascular conditions (hazard ratio 1.37, 95% CI: 1.26-1.48), depression (1.86, 95% CI: 1.73-2.01), diabetes (1.30, 95% CI: 1.15-1.47), gastric acid disorders (1.48, 95% CI: 1.39-1.57), hyperlipidaemia (1.18, 95% CI: 1.09-1.29), osteoporosis (1.65, 95% CI: 1.48-1.85) and pain/pain-inflammation (1.47, 95% CI: 1.39-1.55) compared to the control groups.

Methods:   A survey was circulated to members of the British Association of Urological Surgeons and the British Uro-oncology Group.  Results:   Responses were received from 114 respondents (88 urologists, 26 oncologists). Ninety-seven (94%) use the number of positive cores from each side and 43 (42%) use the % number of positive cores. When determining the number and percentage of positive cores, 72 (71%) would not differentiate between targeted and non-targeted samples. If multiple Gleason Scores (GS) were included in a report, 77 (78%) would use the worst GS even if present in a core with very little tumour, 12% would use the global GS and 10% the GS in the core most involved by tumour. Fifty-five (55%) either never or rarely used perineural invasion for patient management.  Conclusions:   The number of positive cores is an important parameter for patient management but may be difficult to determine in the laboratory due to core fragmentation so the biopsy taker must indicate the number of biopsies obtained. Multiple biopsies taken from a single site are often interpreted by clinicians as separate cores when determining the number of positive cores so pathologists should also report the number of sites positive.

This study aimed to test the external validity of our previous findings using a nationwide database while focusing on overall mortality as an endpoint. To this end, we identified 5498 pN1 PCa patients who were treated with RP, pelvic lymph node dissection, and androgen deprivation therapy with or without aRT, within the National Cancer Database, between 2004 and 2015. Patients were divided into five groups based on our previously published algorithm. Similar to our previous report, multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that only two of these groups benefit from aRT: (1) those with one to two positive nodes, pathological Gleason score 7-10, and pT3b/4 disease or positive surgical margins (hazard ratio [HR]=0.75); and (2) those with three to four positive nodes, regardless of local tumor characteristics (HR=0.57, both p=0.01).

Cellular retinol binding protein-1 (CRBP-1) as a carrier protein transports retinol from the liver storage site to peripheral tissue. Up-regulated expression of CRBP-1 is associated with some tumor types such as prostate cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer as reported, but its role in TSCC remains uncertain.  Methods:   In this study, an integrated bioinformatics analysis based on the multiple cancer microarray data sets available from Oncomine database was conducted to view the differential expression of CRBP-1 between TSCC and the adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting (WB) and immunohistochemical (IHC) assays were performed to investigate CRBP-1 expression in 101 paraffin-embeded TSCC tissues and 48 pairs of freshly frozen tissues. Kaplan-Meier curve and univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analysis were used to estimate the association between CRBP-1 expression and patients' prognosis. Then western blotting, MTT, transwell migration and invasion assays were performed in TSCC cell lines to investigate the effects of CRBP-1 on cellular proliferation and invasion.  Results:   Compared with the matched adjacent non-tumorous tissues, the expression of CRBP-1 was significantly up-regulated in TSCC tissues, which correlated with the differentiation state (P = 0.003), N classification (P = 0.048), the clinical stage (P = 0.048) and death (P = 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that TSCC patients with higher CRBP-1 expression levels had lower overall survival rates than those with lower CRBP-1 expression levels. A univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that CRBP-1 was an independent prognostic factor (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we knocked down CRBP-1 expression and observed that TSCC cell proliferation and invasion in vitro were significantly blocked, as determined by MTT and transwell assays.  Conclusions:   Up-regulated expression of CRBP-1 is associated with poor prognosis in TSCC, so it might potentially serve as an additional prognostic marker, and the inhibition of CRBP-1 might provide new therapeutic approaches for TSCC.""","""['Yue Chen', 'Tian Tian', 'Min-Jie Mao', 'Wei-Ye Deng', 'Hao Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Overexpression of HMGA2 promotes tongue cancer metastasis through EMT pathway.', 'LncRNA MALAT1 expression inhibition suppresses tongue squamous cell carcinoma proliferation, migration and invasion by inactivating PI3K/Akt pathway and downregulating MMP-9 expression.', 'EphA8 is a Prognostic Factor for Oral Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'MicroRNAs in human tongue squamous cell carcinoma: From pathogenesis to therapeutic implications.', 'A review of the most promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis prediction of tongue squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Coronary artery disease-associated immune gene RBP1 and its pan-cancer analysis.', 'Identity of MMP1 and its effects on tumor progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Cellular retinol binding protein-1 inhibits cancer stemness via upregulating WIF1 to suppress Wnt/β-catenin pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Integrative Analysis of Identifying Methylation-Driven Genes Signature Predicts Prognosis in Colorectal Carcinoma.', 'Anticancer Potential of Selected Flavonols: Fisetin, Kaempferol, and Quercetin on Head and Neck Cancers.']"""

The bone morphogenetic protein family is the largest within the transforming growth factor (TGF) superfamily. A little have been known about the molecular evolution of bone morphogenetic proteins exhibiting potential role in mammalian reproduction. In this study we investigated mammalian bone morphogenetic proteins using maximum likelihood approaches of codon substitutions to identify positive Darwinian selection in various species. The proportion of positively selected sites was tested by different likelihood models for individual codon, and M8 were found to be the best model. The percentage of positively elected sites under M8 are 2.20% with ω = 1.089 for BMP2, 1.6% with ω = 1.61 for BMP 4 0.53% for BMP15 with ω = 1.56 and 0.78% for GDF9 with ω = 1.93. The percentage of estimated selection sites under M8 is strong statistical confirmation that divergence of bone morphogenetic proteins is driven by Darwinian selection. For the proteins, model M8 was found significant for all proteins with ω > 1. To further test positive selection on particular amino acids, the evolutionary conservation of amino acid were measured based on phylogenetic linkage among sequences. For exploring the impact of these somatic substitution mutations in the selection region on human cancer, we identified one pathogenic mutation in human BMP4 and one in BMP15, possibly causing prostate cancer and six neutral mutations in BMPs.

This observation was consistent with global chromatin association findings in HeLa S3 cells, revealing the enrichment of Pygo2 and MYC at promoters of biorientation and segmentation genes, at which Pygo2 maintained histone H3K27 acetylation. Immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays demonstrated MYC and Pygo2 interacting in nuclei, corroborated in a heterologous MYC-driven prostate cancer model that was distinct from Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Mutations and dysregulations of lncRNAs are implicated in miscellaneous human diseases. Predicting lncRNA-disease associations is beneficial to disease diagnosis as well as treatment. Although many computational methods have been developed, precisely identifying lncRNA-disease associations, especially for novel lncRNAs, remains challenging.  Results:   In this study, we propose a method (named SIMCLDA) for predicting potential lncRNA-disease associations based on inductive matrix completion. We compute Gaussian interaction profile kernel of lncRNAs from known lncRNA-disease interactions and functional similarity of diseases based on disease-gene and gene-gene onotology associations. Then, we extract primary feature vectors from Gaussian interaction profile kernel of lncRNAs and functional similarity of diseases by principal component analysis, respectively. For a new lncRNA, we calculate the interaction profile according to the interaction profiles of its neighbors. At last, we complete the association matrix based on the inductive matrix completion framework using the primary feature vectors from the constructed feature matrices. Computational results show that SIMCLDA can effectively predict lncRNA-disease associations with higher accuracy compared with previous methods. Furthermore, case studies show that SIMCLDA can effectively predict candidate lncRNAs for renal cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer.

Methods:   The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for MIRP from 2012 to 2015. Concurrent IHR was identified using relevant Current Procedural Terminology codes. Primary outcomes were overall complications, reoperations, unplanned readmissions, and mortality within 30 days of MIRP. Secondary outcomes included operative time (OT), length of stay (LOS), prolonged length of stay (PLOS, >2 days), and discharged to continued care (DCC). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify the association between concurrent IHR and outcomes.  Results:   A total of 18,065 patients were included; 375 (2.1%) had concurrent IHR. The unadjusted comparison showed no significant difference in overall complication, reoperation, unplanned readmission, or mortality rates between MIRP+IHR and MIRP only groups. OT was longer in the MIRP+IHR group (229 vs 195 minutes, p < 0.001) but no differences were found in LOS, PLOS, or DCC rates. Multivariable logistic regression showed concurrent IHR was not associated with increased odds of overall complication (odds ratio [OR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49-1.40, p = 0.479), reoperation (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.14-2.30, p = 0.426), unplanned readmission (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.51-1.64, p = 0.771), PLOS (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.86-1.63, p = 0.297), or DCC (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 0.70-5.34, p = 0.202).

We examined the effect of statin use on risk of prostate cancer progression in a population-based, minority-enriched cohort.  Methods:   We used data from prostate cancer cases (45% African American) diagnosed between 2004 and 2007 who participated in the Health Care Access and Prostate Cancer Treatment in North Carolina cohort (HCaP-NC). We abstracted statin use at diagnosis. Men reported if they had ever been diagnosed with high cholesterol. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine associations between statin use and risk of prostate cancer progression (biochemical recurrence or secondary treatment), overall and by race. In secondary analysis, we examined the association between high cholesterol and risk of progression, overall, and by statin use.  Results:   Of 669 men, 244 (36%) were statin users at diagnosis. During 3.8 years median follow-up, 138 men experienced prostate cancer progression. There was no association between statin use and risk of progression, either overall (HR 1.03; 95%CI 0.72-1.46) or stratified by race. High cholesterol was inversely associated with risk of progression, particularly among statin users (HR 0.43; 95%CI 0.20-0.94; p-interaction = 0.22) and in men with higher perceived access to care (HR 0.57; 95%CI 0.36-0.90; p-interaction = 0.03).

Methods:   Fifty newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer as confirmed by needle biopsy were continuously included, 40 in a train set and ten in a test set. 68Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT and clinical data of all patients were retrospectively analyzed. Semi-quantitative analysis of PET images provided maximum standardized uptake (SUVmax) of primary prostate cancer and volumetric parameters including intraprostatic PSMA-derived tumor volume (iPSMA-TV) and intraprostatic total lesion PSMA (iTL-PSMA). According to prostate cancer risk stratification criteria of the NCCN Guideline, all patients were simplified into a low-intermediate risk group or a high-risk group. The semi-quantitative parameters of 68Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT were used to establish a univariate logistic regression model for high-risk prostate cancer and its metastatic risk, and to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the predictive model.  Results:   In the train set, 30/40 (75%) patients had high-risk prostate cancer and 10/40 (25%) patients had low-to-moderate-risk prostate cancer; in the test set, 8/10 (80%) patients had high-risk prostate cancer while 2/10 (20%) had low-intermediate risk prostate cancer. The univariate logistic regression model established with SUVmax, iPSMA-TV and iTL-PSMA could all effectively predict high-risk prostate cancer; the AUC of ROC were 0.843, 0.802 and 0.900, respectively.

The development of radiation-resistant disease is an obstacle for nearly 30-50% of patients undergoing radiotherapy. A better understanding of mechanisms that lead to radiation resistance could aid in the development of sensitizing agents to improve outcome. Here we identified a radiation-resistance pathway mediated by CD105, downstream of BMP and TGF-β signaling. Antagonizing CD105-dependent BMP signaling with a partially humanized monoclonal antibody, TRC105, resulted in a significant reduction in clonogenicity when combined with irradiation. In trying to better understand the mechanism for the radio-sensitization, we found that radiation-induced CD105/BMP signaling was sufficient and necessary for the upregulation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in contributing to p53 stabilization and PGC-1α activation. Combining TRC105 with irradiation delayed DNA damage repair compared to irradiation alone. However, in the absence of p53 function, combining TRC105 and radiation resulted in no reduction in clonogenicity compared to radiation alone, despite similar reduction of DNA damage repair observed in p53-intact cells. This suggested DNA damage repair was not the sole determinant of CD105 radio-resistance. As cancer cells undergo an energy deficit following irradiation, due to the demands of DNA and organelle repair, we examined SIRT1's role on p53 and PGC-1α with respect to glycolysis and mitochondrial biogenesis, respectively. Consequently, blocking the CD105-SIRT1 axis was found to deplete the ATP stores of irradiated cells and cause G2 cell cycle arrest. Xenograft models supported these findings that combining TRC105 with irradiation significantly reduces tumor size over irradiation alone (p value = 10-9). We identified a novel synthetic lethality strategy of combining radiation and CD105 targeting to address the DNA repair and metabolic addiction induced by irradiation in p53-functional prostate cancers.""","""['Anisha Madhav', 'Allen Andres', 'Frank Duong', 'Rajeev Mishra', 'Subhash Haldar', 'Zhenqiu Liu', 'Bryan Angara', 'Roberta Gottlieb', 'Zachary S Zumsteg', 'Neil A Bhowmick']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Monoclonal antibody to HER-2/neureceptor modulates repair of radiation-induced DNA damage and enhances radiosensitivity of human breast cancer cells overexpressing this oncogene.', 'Zerumbone Regulates DNA Repair Responding to Ionizing Radiation and Enhances Radiosensitivity of Human Prostatic Cancer Cells.', 'MDM2 Inhibition Sensitizes Prostate Cancer Cells to Androgen Ablation and Radiotherapy in a p53-Dependent Manner.', 'Cell cycle regulation after exposure to ionizing radiation.', 'Problems of radiobiology and p53 protein.', 'Immunotargeting of Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Griseofulvin Radiosensitizes Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells and Activates cGAS.', 'Fatty Acid Signaling Impacts Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity in an Autocrine and Paracrine Manner.', 'Targeting purinergic pathway to enhance radiotherapy-induced immunogenic cancer cell death.', 'Antagonizing Glutamine Bioavailability Promotes Radiation Sensitivity in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Analysis of patient samples reveals increased levels of FZD8 in cancer, correlating with Wnt-11. FZD8 co-localizes and co-immunoprecipitates with Wnt-11 and potentiates Wnt-11 activation of ATF2-dependent transcription. FZD8 silencing reduces prostate cancer cell migration, invasion, three-dimensional (3D) organotypic cell growth, expression of EMT-related genes, and TGF-β/Smad-dependent signaling.

In case of prostate cancer, we once showed that antineoplastic activity of Plk1 inhibitor is largely due to inhibition of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, we also discovered that Plk1 inhibition causes activation of the β-catenin pathway and increased expression of c-MYC, eventually resulting in resistance to Plk1 inhibition. JQ1, a selective small-molecule inhibitor targeting the amino-terminal bromodomains of BRD4, has been shown to dramatically inhibit c-MYC expression and AR signaling, exhibiting antiproliferative effects in a range of cancers. Because c-MYC and AR signaling are essential for prostate cancer initiation and progression, we aim to test whether targeting Plk1 and BRD4 at the same time is an effective approach to treat prostate cancer. Herein, we show that a combination of Plk1 inhibitor GSK461364A and BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 had a strong synergistic effect on castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell lines, as well as in CRPC xenograft tumors. Mechanistically, the synergistic effect is likely due to two reasons: (i) Plk1 inhibition results in the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus, thus elevation of c-MYC expression, whereas JQ1 treatment directly suppresses c-MYC transcription; (ii) Plk1 and BRD4 dual inhibition acts synergistically in inhibition of AR signaling.

The functional and predictive role of changes in MEIS expression within prostate tumor progression, however, remain largely unexplored.Experimental Design: Here we utilize RNA expression datasets, annotated tissue microarrays, and cell-based functional assays to investigate the role of MEIS1 and MEIS2 in prostate cancer and metastatic progression.Results: These analyses demonstrate a stepwise decrease in the expression of both MEIS1 and MEIS2 from benign epithelia, to primary tumor, to metastatic tissues. Positive expression of MEIS proteins in primary tumors, however, is associated with a lower hazard of clinical metastasis (HR = 0.28) after multivariable analysis. Pathway and gene set enrichment analyses identified MEIS-associated networks involved in cMYC signaling, cellular proliferation, motility, and local tumor environment. Depletion of MEIS1 and MEIS2 resulted in increased tumor growth over time in vivo, and decreased MEIS expression in both patient-derived tumors and MEIS-depleted cell lines was associated with increased expression of the protumorigenic genes cMYC and CD142, and decreased expression of AXIN2, FN1, ROCK1, SERPINE2, SNAI2, and TGFβ2.Conclusions: These data implicate a functional role for MEIS proteins in regulating cancer progression, and support a hypothesis whereby tumor expression of MEIS1 and MEIS2 expression confers a more indolent prostate cancer phenotype, with a decreased propensity for metastatic progression.

A daily inserted endorectal balloon (ERB) during EBRT aims to reduce anorectal toxicity. Our goal is to objectify anorectal function over time after prostate intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with ERB.  Material and methods:   Sixty men, irradiated with IMRT and an ERB, underwent barostat measurements and anorectal manometry prior to EBRT and 6 months, one year and 2 years after radiotherapy. Primary outcome measures were rectal distensibility and rectal sensibility in response to stepwise isobaric distensions and anal pressures.  Results:   Forty-eight men completed all measurements. EBRT reduced maximal rectal capacity 2 years after EBRT (250 ± 10 mL vs. 211 ± 10 mL; p < 0.001), area under the pressure-volume curve (2878 ± 270 mL mmHg vs. 2521 ± 305 mL mmHg; p = 0.043) and rectal compliance (NS). Sensory pressure thresholds for first sense and first urge (both p < 0.01) increased. Anal maximum pressure diminished after IMRT (p = 0.006).  Conclusions:   Rectal capacity and sensory function are increasingly affected over time after radiotherapy. There is an indication that these reductions are affected less with IMRT + ERB compared to conventional radiation techniques.""","""['Robin Krol', 'Gill M McColl', 'Wim P M Hopman', 'Robert J Smeenk']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Increased rectal wall stiffness after prostate radiotherapy: relation with fecal urgency.', 'Differences in radiation dosimetry and anorectal function testing imply that anorectal symptoms may arise from different anatomic substrates.', 'Local Protocol Variations for Image Guided Radiation Therapy in the Multicenter Dutch Hypofractionation (HYPRO) Trial: Impact of Rectal Balloon and MRI Delineation on Anorectal Dose and Gastrointestinal Toxicity Levels.', 'Systematic review: anal and rectal changes after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Anorectal physiology and pathophysiology.', 'In vivo dosimetry with an electronic portal imaging device for prostate cancer radiotherapy with an endorectal balloon.', 'Effectiveness of rectal displacement devices in managing prostate motion: a\xa0systematic review.', 'Prostatic irradiation-induced sexual dysfunction: a review and multidisciplinary guide to management in the radical radiotherapy era (Part I defining the organ at risk for sexual toxicities).', 'Once-a-week or every-other-day urethra-sparing prostate cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy, a randomized phase II trial: 18 months follow-up results.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for acute anal toxicity after radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients.']"""

The question of how to define the intraprostatic boost volume is still open. Previous studies showed that multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) or PSMA PET alone could be used for boost volume definition. However, other studies proposed that the combined usage of both has the highest sensitivity in detection of intraprostatic lesions. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility and to evaluate the tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of radiation therapy dose painting using 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA PET/CT, mpMRI or the combination of both in primary PCa.  Methods:   Ten patients underwent PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI followed by prostatectomy. Three gross tumour volumes (GTVs) were created based on PET (GTV-PET), mpMRI (GTV-MRI) and the union of both (GTV-union). Two plans were generated for each GTV. Plan95 consisted of whole-prostate IMRT to 77 Gy in 35 fractions and a simultaneous boost to 95 Gy (Plan95PET/Plan95MRI/Plan95union). Plan80 consisted of whole-prostate IMRT to 76 Gy in 38 fractions and a simultaneous boost to 80 Gy (Plan80PET/Plan80MRI/Plan80union). TCPs were calculated for GTV-histo (TCP-histo), which was delineated based on PCa distribution in co-registered histology slices. NTCPs were assessed for bladder and rectum.  Results:   Dose constraints of published protocols were reached in every treatment plan. Mean TCP-histo were 99.7% (range: 97%-100%) and 75.5% (range: 33%-95%) for Plan95union and Plan80union, respectively. Plan95union had significantly higher TCP-histo values than Plan95MRI (p = 0.008) and Plan95PET (p = 0.008). Plan80union had significantly higher TCP-histo values than Plan80MRI (p = 0.012), but not than Plan80PET (p = 0.472). Plan95MRI had significantly lower NTCP-rectum than Plan95union (p = 0.012). No significant differences in NTCP-rectum and NTCP-bladder were observed for all other plans (p > 0.05).  Conclusions:   IMRT dose escalation on GTVs based on mpMRI, PSMA PET/CT and the combination of both was feasible.

Patients and methods:   Within Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry (2001-2014), we identified patients with ccmRCC and non-ccmRCC. We relied on propensity score (PS) matching to reduce the effect of inherent differences between African-American vs. Caucasian patients. After PS matching that included access to cytoreductive nephrectomy (CNT), cumulative incidence, competing-risks regression (CRR) models and landmark analyses tested the effect of race on CSM.  Results:   Before PS matching, African-American patients accounted for 7.0 and 24.5% of respectively ccmRCC (N = 6742) and non-ccmRCC patients (N = 766). After PS matching, African-American patients accounted for 22.3 and 33.5% of respectively ccmRCC (N = 2050) and non-ccmRCC (N = 391) matched cohorts. In multivariable CRR models focusing on ccmRCC, higher CSM was recorded in African-Americans (HR:1.27, p < 0.001). Conversely, in non-ccmRCC, lower CSM was recorded in African-Americans (HR:0.54, p < 0.001). Landmark analyses rejected the hypothesis of immortal time bias.

In addition to genomic alterations, aberrant activation of WT RTKs plays an important role in driving cancer progression. However, the mechanisms underlying how RTKs drive prostate cancer remain incompletely characterized. Here we show that non-proteolytic ubiquitination of RTK regulates its kinase activity and contributes to RTK-mediated prostate cancer metastasis. TRAF4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is highly expressed in metastatic prostate cancer. We demonstrated here that it is a key player in regulating RTK-mediated prostate cancer metastasis. We further identified TrkA, a neurotrophin RTK, as a TRAF4-targeted ubiquitination substrate that promotes cancer cell invasion and found that inhibition of TrkA activity abolished TRAF4-dependent cell invasion. TRAF4 promoted K27- and K29-linked ubiquitination at the TrkA kinase domain and increased its kinase activity. Mutation of TRAF4-targeted ubiquitination sites abolished TrkA tyrosine autophosphorylation and its interaction with downstream proteins. TRAF4 knockdown also suppressed nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulated TrkA downstream p38 MAPK activation and invasion-associated gene expression. Furthermore, elevated TRAF4 levels significantly correlated with increased NGF-stimulated invasion-associated gene expression in prostate cancer patients, indicating that this signaling axis is significantly activated during oncogenesis.

DCE MRI parameters can reflect tumor angiogenesis and, therefore, can provide information about tumor behavior. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to analyze the reported data regarding associations between Ktrans (volume transfer constant) and microvessel density (MVD) in different tumors.  Patients and methods:   For this meta-analysis the MEDLINE library was screened for associations between Ktrans and MVD in different tumors up to July 2017. After thorough reviewing, the present analysis included 16 studies. The following data were extracted from the literature: authors, year of publication, number of patients, tumor type, MR scanners, study design, and correlation coefficients.  Results:   The identified correlation coefficients ranged from -0.65 to 0.75. The calculated pooled correlation coefficient was 0.23 (95%CI=0.07-0.38).

We transfected the PC-3 and DU145 cells with negative NC ShRNA and AXL-ShRNA, respectively, which were confirmed to be effective, detected the proliferation, apoptosis and cycle distribution of the cells by CCK8, MTT and flow cytometry after treated with the AXL-inhibitor MP470 and/or docetaxel, and determined the expression of the ABCB1 protein in the PC-3-DR and DU145-DR cells after intervention with the AXL-inhibitor R428 and/or docetaxel.  Results:   The expression of the AXL protein in the PC-3 and DU145 cells was significantly increased after docetaxel treatment (P <0.05).

We performed miRNA profiling and found substantial differences in the miRNA landscape of prostate cancer (PC3) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 exosomes with little correlation in abundance of common miRNAs (R2 = 0.16). Using a systems-level bioinformatics approach, the most abundant miRNAs in PC3 exosomes but not HEK exosomes were predicted to significantly modulate integrin signaling, with integrin-β3 loss inducing macrophage M2 polarization. PC3 but not HEK exosomes downregulated integrin-β3 expression levels by 70%. There was a dose-dependent polarization of RAW 264.7 macrophages toward an M2 phenotype when treated with PC3-derived exosomes but not HEK-derived exosomes. Conversely, HEK exosomes, widely utilized as delivery vehicles, were predicted to target cadherin signaling, with experimental validation showing a significant increase in the migratory potential of MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with HEK exosomes.

Further, TAK1 activates p38 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR to support the persistent SASP signaling. As TAK1 is implicated in dual feedforward mechanisms to orchestrate the SASP development, pharmacologically targeting TAK1 deprives cancer cells of resistance acquired from treatment-damaged stromal cells in vitro and substantially promotes tumour regression in vivo.

The histone demethylase JMJD1A (Jumonji domain containing 1A) functions as a key coactivator for AR by epigenetic regulation of H3K9 methylation marks. Here, we describe a role for JMJD1A in AR-V7 expression. While JMJD1A knockdown had no effect on full-length AR (AR-FL), it reduced AR-V7 levels in prostate cancer cells. Reexpression of AR-V7 in the JMJD1A-knockdown cells elevated expression of select AR targets and partially rescued prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. The AR-V7 protein level correlated positively with JMJD1A in a subset of human prostate cancer specimens. Mechanistically, we found that JMJD1A promoted alternative splicing of AR-V7 through heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (HNRNPF), a splicing factor known to regulate exon inclusion. Knockdown of JMJD1A or HNRNPF inhibited splicing of AR-V7, but not AR-FL, in a minigene reporter assay. JMJD1A was found to interact with and promote the recruitment of HNRNPF to a cryptic exon 3b on AR pre-mRNA for the generation of AR-V7.

Thirty-four men newly commencing ADT (cases, median age: 67.6 years (interquartile range: 64.6-72.0)) and 29 age-matched (70.6 years (65.3-72.9)) prostate cancer controls not on ADT were assessed 2 years after cessation of ADT (median: 4.4 years).

Median duration of ADT was 2.3 years (interquartile range: 1.8-3.1). Two years after cessation of ADT, total testosterone remained lower (MAD: -3.4 nmol/L (-6.3 to -0.5), P < 0.022), fat mass (2214 g (490-3933), P = 0.025) and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance: 0.69 (0.31-1.07), P < 0.001) remained higher in cases, whereas lean mass (-1450 g (-2259 to -640), P < 0.001) and physical component of QoL remained lower than controls (-11.9 (-16.4 to -7.4), P < 0.001).

In this study, we screened small-molecule libraries for inhibition of ERG protein in TMPRSS2-ERG harboring VCaP prostate cancer cells using an In-Cell Western Assay with the highly specific ERG-MAb (9FY). Among a subset of promising candidates, 1-[2-Thiazolylazo]-2-naphthol (NSC139021, hereafter ERGi-USU) was identified and further characterized. ERGi-USU selectively inhibited growth of ERG-positive cancer cell lines with minimal effect on normal prostate or endothelial cells or ERG-negative tumor cell lines. Combination of ERGi-USU with enzalutamide showed additive effects in inhibiting growth of VCaP cells. A screen of kinases revealed that ERGi-USU directly bound the ribosomal biogenesis regulator atypical kinase RIOK2 and induced ribosomal stress signature. In vivo, ERGi-USU treatment inhibited growth of ERG-positive VCaP tumor xenografts with no apparent toxicity.

In this report, we propose a new approach for improving the antitumor efficacy of SMDCs based on nanoparticle-assisted delivery. Ideally, a nanoparticle-based delivery vehicle would prolong the half-life of an SMDC in blood and then release it in response to stimuli in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, PEGylated bilirubin-based nanoparticles (BRNPs) were chosen as an appropriate delivery carrier because of their ability to release drugs in response to TME-associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) through rapid particle disruption. As a model SMDC, ACUPA-SN38 was synthesized by linking the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting ligand, ACUPA, to the chemotherapeutic agent, SN38. ACUPA-SN38 was loaded into BRNPs using a film-formation and rehydration method. The resulting ACUPA-SN38@BRNPs exhibited ROS-mediated particle disruption and rapid release of the SMDC, resulting in greater cytotoxicity toward PSMA-overexpressing prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) than toward ROS-unresponsive ACUPA-SN38@Liposomes. In a pharmacokinetic study, the circulation time of ACUPA-SN38@BRNPs in blood was prolonged by approximately 2-fold compared with that of the SMDC-based micellar nanoparticles. Finally, ACUPA-SN38@BRNPs showed greater antitumor efficacy in a PSMA-overexpressing human prostate xenograft tumor model than SN38@BRNPs or the SMDC alone. Collectively, these findings suggest that BRNPs are a viable delivery carrier option for various cancer-targeting SMDCs that suffer from short circulation half-life and limited therapeutic efficacy.""","""['Soyoung Lee', 'Yonghyun Lee', 'Hyungjun Kim', 'Dong Yun Lee', 'Sangyong Jon']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biomacromolecules""","""['PEG-PLA nanoparticles decorated with small-molecule PSMA ligand for targeted delivery of galbanic acid and docetaxel to prostate cancer cells.', 'Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Assessment of Carborane-Loaded Theranostic Nanoparticles to Target Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', 'Biotinylated Bilirubin Nanoparticles as a Tumor Microenvironment-Responsive Drug Delivery System for Targeted Cancer Therapy.', 'A review of nanoparticle drug delivery systems responsive to endogenous breast cancer microenvironment.', 'Mesoporous nanodrug delivery system: a powerful tool for a new paradigm of remodeling of the tumor microenvironment.', 'Toward nanotechnology-enabled application of bilirubin in the treatment and diagnosis of various civilization diseases.', 'Indirect bilirubin impairs invasion of osteosarcoma cells via inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/MMP-2 signaling pathway by suppressing intracellular ROS.', 'Post Transplantation Bilirubin Nanoparticles Ameliorate Murine Graft Versus Host Disease via a Reduction of Systemic and Local Inflammation.', 'Targeted Delivery Methods for Anticancer Drugs.', 'Pharmaceutical strategies for preventing toxicity and promoting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of bilirubin.']"""

In a 46, XY patient with female external genitalia, together with a loss of function mutation S441P, we identified a novel missense mutation V366M at the catalytic center of CYP17A1 which preferentially impaired 17,20 lyase activity. Kinetic experiments with bacterially expressed proteins revealed that V366M mutant enzyme can bind and metabolize pregnenolone to 17OH-pregnenolone, but 17OH-pregnenolone binding and conversion to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was impaired, explaining the patient&rsquo;s steroid profile. Abiraterone could not bind and inhibit the 17&alpha;-hydroxylase activity of the CYP17A1-V366M mutant. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that V366M creates a &ldquo;one-way valve&rdquo; and suggests a mechanism for dual activities of human CYP17A1 where, after the conversion of pregnenolone to 17OH-pregnenolone, the product exits the active site and re-enters for conversion to dehydroepiandrosterone. The V366M mutant also explained the effectiveness of the anti-prostate cancer drug abiraterone as a potent inhibitor of CYP17A1 by binding tightly at the active site in the WT enzyme. The V366M is the first human mutation to be described at the active site of CYP17A1 that causes isolated 17,20 lyase deficiency.

Methods:   228 patients underwent TRUS-guided prostate biopsy after examinations of TRUS and CETRUS scanning. Cancer detection between CETRUS and TRUS were compared by patient and by site in different areas (right, left; base, mid-gland, apex). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CETRUS.  Results:   89 patients were malignant and 48 patients were significant cancer. Compared with TRUS, CETRUS could increase the detection rates of overall and significant cancer (P = 0.008; P = 0.031). CETRUS had higher sensitivity, specificity (except right lobe), accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) in total, right and left lobe (P < 0.05). The sensitivity were greater for CETRUS in all areas except left base and right apex (P < 0.05). The accuracy were greater for CETRUS in all areas except left mid-gland and right apex (P < 0.05).

We investigated the expression, prognostic value and functional role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) brain-derived neurotrophin factor antisense (BDNF-AS) in CaP.  Methods:   Clinical tumor samples were excised from patients with CaP. Their endogenous BDNF-AS expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Correlations between CaP patients' endogenous BDNF-AS expression and their clinicopathological factors, overall survival were statistically analyzed. BDNF-AS expression levels were also probed in immortal CaP cell lines. In LNCaP and PC-3 cells, BDNF-AS was ectopically overexpressed through lentiviral transduction. The functions of BDNF-AS upregulation on CaP cell development were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   BDNF-AS was downregulated in human CaP tumors. Low BDNF-AS expression was correlated with CaP patients' poor prognosis and shorter overall survival. BDNF-AS was also found to be lowly expressed in CaP cell lines. In LNCaP and PC-3 cells, lentivirus-driven BDNF-AS overexpression exerted significantly tumor-suppressing effects on hindering cancer cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, and explant growth in vivo.

Objective:   To project the future burden of cancer in WTC-exposed FDNY rescue and recovery workers by estimating the 20-year cancer incidence.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 14 474 WTC-exposed FDNY employees who were cancer-free on January 1, 2012; subgroup analyses were conducted of the cohort's white male population (n = 12 374). In this closed-cohort study, we projected cancer incidence for the January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2031, period. Simulations were run using demographic-specific New York City (NYC) cancer and national mortality rates for each individual, summed for the whole cohort, and performed 1000 times to produce mean estimates. Additional analyses in the subgroup of white men compared case counts produced by using 2007-2011 FDNY WTC Health Program (FDNY-WTCHP) cancer rates vs NYC rates. Average and 20-year aggregate costs of first-year cancer care were estimated using claims data.  Exposures:   World Trade Center disaster exposure defined as rescue and recovery work at the WTC site at any time from September 11, 2001, to July 25, 2002.  Main outcomes and measures:   (1) Projected number of incident cancers in the full cohort, based on NYC cancer rates; (2) cancer incidence estimates in the subgroup projected using FDNY-WTCHP vs NYC rates; and (3) estimated first-year treatment costs of incident cancers.  Results:   On January 1, 2012, the cohort was 96.8% male, 87.1% white, and had a mean (SD) age of 50.2 (9.2) years. The projected number of incident cancer cases was 2960 (95% CI, 2883-3037). In our subgroup analyses using FDNY-WTCHP vs NYC cancer rates, the projected number of new cases in white men was elevated (2714 [95% CI, 2638-2786] vs 2596 [95% CI, 2524-2668]). Accordingly, we expect more prostate (1437 [95% CI, 1383-1495] vs 863 [95% CI, 816-910]), thyroid (73 [95% CI, 60-86] vs 57 [95% CI, 44-69]), and melanoma cases (201 [95% CI, 179-223] vs 131 [95% CI, 112-150), but fewer lung (237 [95% CI, 212-262] vs 373 [95% CI, 343-405]), colorectal (172 [95% CI, 152-191] vs 267 [95% CI, 241-292]), and kidney cancers (66 [95% CI, 54-80] vs 132 [95% CI, 114-152]) (P < .001 for all comparisons). The estimated 20-year cost of first-year treatment was $235 835 412 (95% CI, $187 582 227-$284 088 597).

We also assessed whether certain prostate specific antigen thresholds at androgen deprivation therapy initiation are associated with poorer outcomes.  Materials and methods:   We identified 2,418 men with rising prostate specific antigen after undergoing radical prostatectomy at a single institution between 1987 and 2007 in a prospectively maintained registry. Early progression was defined as clinical progression within 2 years of initiating androgen deprivation therapy. The primary study outcome was cancer specific and overall survival.  Results:   The risk of early progression while on androgen deprivation therapy was lower for prostate specific antigen doubling time 3 to less than 9 months (OR 0.19) and less than 9 months or longer (OR 0.10, each p <0.001) prior to androgen deprivation therapy. Independent predictors of cancer specific survival were metastatic disease at androgen deprivation therapy initiation (HR 2.60), prostate specific antigen 5 to 50 ng/ml (HR 2.68) and 50 ng/ml or greater (HR 4.33), and doubling time 3 to less than 9 months (HR 0.54) and 9 months or longer (HR 0.45, all p <0.001). Independent predictors of overall survival were prostate specific antigen 5 to 50 ng/ml (HR 3.10) and 50 ng/ml or greater (HR 5.20, each p <0.001).  Conclusions:   In men in whom androgen deprivation therapy was initiated for relapse after radical prostatectomy prostate specific antigen doubling time less than 3 months and prostate specific antigen 5 ng/ml or greater were adverse prognostic factors for early progression and cancer specific survival. Prostate specific antigen 5 ng/ml or greater also predicted shorter overall survival.

This study evaluated the histopathological effects in prostate biopsies of recombinant fowlpox (rF) virus-based vaccine engineered to present the PSA and 3 costimulatory molecules (collectively labeled as PSA-TRICOM). This vaccine has shown that it can break tolerance of the PSA, and its administration directly into a tumor enables the affected tumor cells to act as antigen-presenting cells activating new T cells and broadening the immune response to recognize and kill tumor. We studied 10 patients with recurrent prostate cancer who had failed radiation therapy and/or androgen-deprivation therapy. Pre- and posttreatment biopsies were compared. Posttreatment biopsies induced 8 cases with residual adenocarcinoma despite evidences of treatment effect and inflammation, 2 cases did not show any residual tumor, and 1 one case did not have any inflammatory infiltrate or any evidence of treatment effect. The inflammatory infiltrate varied from mild to severe and was composed of mononuclear cells. Greater numbers of infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes were identified around prostatic glands and within the epithelial lining. The most remarkable feature was the presence of increased eosinophils around the glands and stroma.

We aimed to use machine learning to identify patient characteristics associated with biochemical failure (BF) following prostate sHDRB.  Methods and materials:   We analyzed data for 52 patients treated with sHDRB for locally recurrent prostate cancer after previous definitive radiation therapy between 1998 and 2009. Following pathologic confirmation of locally recurrent disease without evidence of metastatic disease, 36 Gy in 6 fractions was administered to the prostate and seminal vesicles. BF following sHDRB was defined using the Phoenix definition. Sixteen different clinical risk features were collected, and machine learning analysis was executed to identify subpopulations at higher risk of BF. Decision tree-based algorithms including classification and regression trees, MediBoost, and random forests were constructed.  Results:   Patients were followed up for a minimum of 5 years after sHDRB. Those with a fraction of positive cores ≥0.35 and a disease-free interval <4.12 years after their initial radiation treatment experienced a higher failure rate after sHDRB of 0.75 versus 0.38 for the rest of the population.  Conclusions:   Using machine learning, we have identified that patients with a fraction of positive cores ≥0.35 and a disease-free interval <4.1 years might be associated with a high risk of BF following sHDRB.""","""['Gilmer Valdes', 'Albert J Chang', 'Yannet Interian', 'Kenton Owen', 'Shane T Jensen', 'Lyle H Ungar', 'Adam Cunha', 'Timothy D Solberg', 'I-Chow Hsu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In Regard to Valdes et\xa0al.', 'In Reply to Gensheimer and Trister.', 'Salvage HDR brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after previous definitive radiation therapy: 5-year outcomes.', 'Salvage brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiation therapy: A comparison of low-dose-rate and high-dose-rate brachytherapy and the importance of prostate-specific antigen doubling time.', 'Interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy as salvage treatment for locally recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiation therapy: Toxicity and 5-year outcome.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy as salvage modality for locally recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiotherapy : A\xa0systematic review.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Artificial intelligence and machine learning for medical imaging: A technology review.', 'Artificial intelligence in brachytherapy: a summary of recent developments.', 'Development of a Machine Learning Model for Optimal Applicator Selection in High-Dose-Rate Cervical Brachytherapy.', 'Artificial intelligence (AI) and interventional radiotherapy (brachytherapy): state of art and future perspectives.']"""

In microscopic sections from these areas substantial cancers (≥2 mm) were found in 94% and 69%, of glands, respectively. When no cancer was seen grossly, substantial cancers were still identified histologically in 56% of cases on the cut surface of the prostate. Of substantial tumours 58% had distinct gross findings and 20% were considered to be suspicious for cancer on macroscopic examination. It was noted that gross assessment of the tumour diameter usually underestimated the microscopic extent of the tumour (p < 0.001). Of tumours that could be identified conclusively, 30% were tan, 30% white, 16% yellow and 24% orange. Transition zone tumours were most often orange (61%) while peripheral zone tumours were usually tan or white (35% and 33%). All macroscopically identifiable cancers were poorly circumscribed. Among substantial cancers, transition zone tumours were less frequently visualised than peripheral zone tumours (33% and 13%, respectively; p < 0.001). Findings conclusive for cancer macroscopically usually predict microscopic cancer, but substantial cancers may be present even if no cancer is seen grossly.

Here we show that montelukast, a clinical leukotriene receptor antagonist for the treatment of asthma, inhibits hypoxia or CoCl2-induced HIF-1α activation and reduces its protein expression in prostate cancer cells. However, the other two leukotriene receptor antagonists, pranlukast and zafirlukast, cannot decrease HIF-1α protein, which indicates that montelukast-induced downregulation of HIF-1α is not mediated by leukotriene receptor. Neither proteasome inhibitor MG132 nor the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) can block montelukast-induced downregulation of HIF-1α protein. Interestingly, GSK2606414, a PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) inhibitor, abrogates montelukast-induced downregulation of HIF-1α under hypoxic conditions. However, montelukast increases phosphorylation of eIF-2α at Ser51. Moreover, montelukast inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, which can be reversed by overexpression of HIF-1α protein.

Materials and methods:   A total of 584 consecutive men (biopsy naive, n = 392; repeated biopsy, n = 192) with suspected PCa who underwent prebiopsy 3-T multipara-metric MRI, followed by subsequent biopsies, were enrolled. Cancer-positive findings were confirmed at systemic biopsies and cognitive MRI-targeted biopsies, whereas cancer-negative findings were confirmed at systemic biopsies performed during subsequent follow-up. Missing and detection rates of all PCa and clinically significant cancer according to five biopsy-based definitions were determined. The likelihood of PCa at multiparametric MRI was evaluated according to PI-RADS version 2, and the results were compared.  Results:   Pathologically confirmed cancers were found in 25% of patients. Cancer-positive MRI findings were seen in 99 men (17%) and, of these, 85.9% had PCa. Of 485 men with cancer-negative MRI findings, a total of 61 (12.6%) had PCa, including 46 men in the biopsy-naive group and 15 men in the repeated-biopsy group. For clinically significant cancers, the rate of missed cancers at MRI was 0.1-6.0%, and the detection rate was 21.2-83.5%. For detecting PCa, multiparametric MRI had 96.8% specificity, 87.2% accuracy, and 87.4% negative predictive value.

Case:   The authors describe a 68-year-old man with widespread skin and soft tissue metastases appearing as the first and dominant clinical manifestation of oncologic disease. Physical examination and CT scans revealed multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous tumor nodules arising in the neck, chest, abdomen, lumbar region and right forearm, as well as in the gluteal and iliacus muscles and in the proximal part of the left thigh. Light microscopy confirmed a metastasis of adenocarcinoma exhibiting a tubuloglandular pattern and a slight mucin production. It was immunoreactive for cytokeratin 7 and carcinoembryonic antigen and negative for cytokeratin 20, CDX-2, TTF-1 and prostatic specific antigen. Based upon the histomorphology and immunophenotype, the pathologist suggested a primary tumor in the stomach or biliopancreatic tract. However, further clinical workup did not clearly identify a primary lesion.  Conclusion:   Determining the origin of cutaneous metastases might be a challenging issue for both clinicians and pathologists. The case we describe is uncommon because widespread skin and subcutaneous metastases appeared as the first and dominant clinical sign of adenocarcinoma, the origin of which has not been established. This unusual tumor behavior may suggest that a spreading and colonization of metastatic cancer cells in the skin and soft tissue may be a specific biologic process.Key words: skin metastases - malignancy of unknown origin - adenocarcinoma.""","""['Vladimír Bartoš', 'Kamila Hamarová']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Klin Onkol""","""['Multiple nodules on the face and trunk in metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary origin.', 'Folliculotropic Cutaneous Metastases and Lymphangitis Carcinomatosa: When Cutaneous Metastases of Breast Carcinoma Are Mistaken for Cutaneous Infections.', 'Cutaneous metastasis from gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma of unknown primary origin.', 'Soft-tissue metastasis revealing a pancreatic adenocarcinoma: one case report and a review of literature.', 'Cutaneous metastasis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma after kidney transplant: a case report and review of the literature.']"""

This study aimed to investigate if men afflicted with ED harbor an increased risk of prostate cancer, utilizing two concurrent comparison groups, constructed from the Taiwan NHIRD, with up to 8 years' follow-up. Among men with no preexisting prostate cancer, an ED group of 3,593 men ≥ 40 years of age and two non-ED comparison groups of 14,372 men from the general population, 1:4 matched by age and index date (GENPOP); and 3,594 men with clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), matched by similar criteria were assembled. A Cox model was constructed to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) after controlling for age, socioeconomic factors, and various medical comorbidities.

During androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), stroma-derived growth factors and cytokines can activate the androgen receptor (AR). For example, IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that is involved in the malignancy of PCa cells through AR activation. In the present study, we used an androgen-sensitive human PCa cell line (LNCaP) and its sublines to investigate the relationship between the responsiveness of PCa cells to IL-6 treatment and the cellular AR signaling pathway.  Methods:   The androgen-low-sensitive F10 and E9 cells were obtained from LNCaP cells by limiting dilution method in regular culture condition. In contrast, the androgen-insensitive AIDL cells were established from LNCaP cells by continuous passaging in hormone-depleted condition. Original carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) PCaSC-8 and PCaSC-9 cells were isolated from needle biopsy samples of PCa patients.  Results:   In fibroblasts derived from PCa patients, IL-6 secretion was generally higher than that observed with normal fibroblasts. In contrast, IL-6 secretion was not detected in LNCaP and its sublines. The soluble IL-6 receptor was detected in PCa cells but not in fibroblasts. IL-6 treatment suppressed cell growth of LNCaP, F10, and E9 cells but not AIDL cells and it was accompanied with neuroendocrine-like differentiation. Induction of PSA secretion was observed in IL-6-treated LNCaP and F10 cells. VEGF secretion was strongly induced in IL-6-treated LNCaP and AIDL cells. IL-6-induced VEGF secretion was significantly suppressed by a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and it was accompanied by inhibited phosphorylation of Akt.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that IL-6 might induce VEGF secretion from PCa cells in a manner independent of AR activation.

Using a hospital-based registry, we aimed to assess whether a classification based on time of metastatic disease (PLT vs DN) and disease volume (LV vs HV) are prognostic for mHSPC pts treated with ADT.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort of consecutive patients with mHSPC treated with ADT between 1990 and 2013 was selected from the prospectively collected Dana-Farber Cancer Institute database and categorized as DN or PLT and HV or LV, at time of ADT start. Primary and secondary endpoints were OS and time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), respectively, which were measured from date of ADT start using Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models using known prognostic factors was used.  Results:   The analytical cohort consisted of 436 patients.

Totally, 220 cases were evaluated at baseline and during the follow-up at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month interval after therapy. Patients self-completed questionnaires on urinary symptoms and incontinence, erectile and bowel function, psychological distress (PD), anxiety, and depression.  Results:   Several significant differences among the three groups of treatment were found regarding the total score of the functional questionnaires. Regarding PD, cases submitted to radical prostatectomy showed stable scores during all the 12 months of follow-up whereas cases submitted to radiotherapy showed a rapid significant worsening of scores at 1-month interval and persistent also at 6- and 12-month interval. Cases submitted to active surveillance showed a slight and slow worsening of scores only at 12-month interval. PD and depression resulted to be more associated with urinary symptoms than sexual function worsening whereas anxiety resulted to be associated either with urinary symptoms or sexual function worsening.

In this study, we sought to determine whether rectal distension with respect to the rectal behavior might have an impact on prostate translations and/or rotations during prostate image guided radiation therapy using a 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) couch.  Methods and materials:   We reviewed the data from 39 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with protracted external radiation therapy using a 6 DOF couch. Before each fraction, a kilovoltage cone beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT) scan was performed. The automatic fusion algorithm was set to fuse on soft tissue and allowed correction for translations in 3 dimensions and rotations in the longitudinal axis (""roll"") and lateral axis (""pitch""). After contouring the rectum on each kV-CBCT, we determined the cross-sectional area (CSA) and relative CSA (CSArel) by dividing with the CSA of planning CT. The standard deviation of CSArel per patient was used to classify the patients in 2 groups: patients with a stable rectum and patients with an unstable rectum. The CSArel was compared between these 2 groups with a linear mixed model with group as fixed effect and patient as random effect.  Results:   A total of 616 kV-CBCT were analyzed, and 2 subgroups of patients could be defined a posteriori: 19 patients had a stable rectum, mean CSArel (1.06 ± 0.08); the other 20 patients had an unstable rectum, mean CSArel (1.43 ± 0.08). The average pitch in the group with a stable rectum was 0.36° (±0.21) versus 0.40° (±0.20) (P = .898). The pitch was not correlated with the CSArel (P = -.065, r = 0.119). The average roll in the group with a stable rectum was 0.27° (±0.16) versus 0.05° (±0.16) (P = .137). The roll was not correlated with the CSA (P = .094, r = 0.068). The average CSArel was higher (P = .0013) and more variable (P = .035) in the unstable group.

Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3 (STEAP3) is a metalloreductase, which is vital for cellular iron uptake and homeostasis. However, the clinical significance and function of STEAP3 in the development of human gliomas remain unclear. Through analysis of publicly available databases, we found that STEAP3 was highly expressed in malignant gliomas, especially in the mesenchymal glioma molecular subtype and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) wild-type gliomas. Expression levels of STEAP3 in gliomas correlated inversely with patient overall survival (OS) and served as an independent prognostic marker by multivariate Cox regression analysis. In functional assays performed with RNA knockdown, loss of STEAP3 attenuated aggressive phenotypes in glioma cells, including cell proliferation, invasion, and sphere formation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Finally, STEAP3 drives these activities by inducing mesenchymal transition, promoting transferrin receptor (TfR) expression, and activating STAT3-FoxM1 axis signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that STEAP3 functions as an oncogenic mediator in glioma progression and is thus a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of the disease.""","""['Mingzhi Han', 'Ran Xu', 'Shuai Wang', 'Ning Yang', 'Shilei Ni', 'Qing Zhang', 'Yangyang Xu', 'Xin Zhang', 'Chao Zhang', 'Yuzhen Wei', 'Jianxiong Ji', 'Bin Huang', 'Di Zhang', 'Anjing Chen', 'Wenjie Li', 'Rolf Bjerkvig', 'Xingang Li', 'Jian Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['High expression of six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3 promotes the migration and invasion and predicts unfavorable prognosis in glioma.', 'NFAT1-Mediated Regulation of NDEL1 Promotes Growth and Invasion of Glioma Stem-like Cells.', 'miR-139 Functions as An Antioncomir to Repress Glioma Progression Through Targeting IGF-1 R, AMY-1, and PGC-1β.', 'STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'STAMPing at the crossroads of normal physiology and disease states.', 'Identification of STEAP3-based molecular subtype and risk model in ovarian cancer.', 'Ferroptosis regulates key signaling pathways in gastrointestinal tumors: Underlying mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.', 'Upregulation of the ferroptosis-related STEAP3 gene is a specific predictor of poor triple-negative breast cancer patient outcomes.', 'High expression of six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3 promotes the migration and invasion and predicts unfavorable prognosis in glioma.', 'Prognostic Significance of Iron Metabolism Related Genes in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma.']"""

Methods and materials:   Two plan databases were created using retrospective, anonymized data of 124 volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) prostate cancer patients. The clinical plan database (CPD) contained planning data from each patient's clinically treated VMAT plan, which were manually optimized by various planners. The multicriteria optimization database (MCOD) contained Pareto-optimal plan data from VMAT plans created using a standardized multicriteria optimization protocol. Overlap volume histograms, incorporating fractional organ at risk volumes only within the treatment fields, were computed for each patient and used to match new patient anatomy to similar database patients. For each database patient, CPD and MCOD KBP predictions were generated for D10, D30, D50, D65, and D80 of the bladder and rectum in a leave-one-out manner. Prediction achievability was evaluated through a replanning study on a subset of 31 randomly selected database patients using the best KBP predictions, regardless of plan database origin, as planning goals.  Results:   MCOD predictions were significantly lower than CPD predictions for all 5 bladder dose-volumes and rectum D50 (P = .004) and D65 (P < .001), whereas CPD predictions for rectum D10 (P = .005) and D30 (P < .001) were significantly less than MCOD predictions. KBP predictions were statistically achievable in the replans for all predicted dose-volumes, excluding D10 of bladder (P = .03) and rectum (P = .04). Compared with clinical plans, replans showed significant average reductions in Dmean for bladder (7.8 Gy; P < .001) and rectum (9.4 Gy; P < .001), while maintaining statistically similar planning target volume, femoral head, and penile bulb dose.  Conclusion:   KBP dose-volume predictions derived from Pareto plans were more optimal overall than those resulting from manually optimized clinical plans, which significantly improved KBP-assisted plan quality.  Summary:   This work investigates how the plan quality of knowledge databases affects the performance and achievability of dose-volume predictions from a common knowledge-based planning approach for prostate cancer. Bladder and rectum dose-volume predictions derived from a database of standardized Pareto-optimal plans were compared with those derived from clinical plans manually designed by various planners. Dose-volume predictions from the Pareto plan database were significantly lower overall than those from the clinical plan database, without compromising achievability.""","""['Phillip D H Wall', 'Robert L Carver', 'Jonas D Fontenot']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Evaluation of complexity and deliverability of prostate cancer treatment plans designed with a knowledge-based VMAT planning technique.', 'Clinical implementation of a knowledge based planning tool for prostate VMAT.', 'An improved distance-to-dose correlation for predicting bladder and rectum dose-volumes in knowledge-based VMAT planning for prostate cancer.', 'Knowledge-based planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A review of data-driven approaches.', 'Knowledge-based radiation treatment planning: A data-driven method survey.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in intensity modulated radiation treatment planning: an overview.', 'Dose Prediction Models Based on Geometric and Plan Optimization Parameter for Adjuvant Radiotherapy Planning Design in Cervical Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Outcome-based multiobjective optimization of lymphoma radiation therapy plans.', 'Knowledge-Based Tradeoff Hyperplanes for Head and Neck Treatment Planning.', 'Evaluation of complexity and deliverability of prostate cancer treatment plans designed with a knowledge-based VMAT planning technique.']"""

Methods:   Expression level of MyoD was assessed in prostate cancer tissues using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry and in experimentally induced castration-resistant LNCaP/R cells using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Effect of MyoD knockdown on LNCaP/R cell progression was determined by assessing cell proliferation, apoptosis, and colony formation rate. The effect of MyoD knockdown on the oxidative stress state in PC3 cells was determined by assessing antioxidant response gene expression and glutathione synthetase-to-glutathione ratio. Finally, the functional link between the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 1 (NRF1) and the regulation of antioxidant response element-driven transcription by MyoD was studied at both molecular and functional levels.  Results:   MyoD expression was significantly upregulated in hormone-refractory prostate cancer tissues and in experimentally induced castration-resistant LNCaP/R cells, and MyoD knockdown effectively impaired LNCaP/R cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis under androgen-depleted condition. Moreover, MyoD enhanced the glutathione production and protected against oxidative stress by positively regulating a cluster of antioxidant genes known to be the downstream targets of NRF1. Mechanistically, MyoD could augment the antioxidant response element-driven transcription in an NRF1-dependent manner, and the stimulatory effect of MyoD on the antioxidant response was substantially compromised in the presence of NRF1 small interfering RNA treatment.

The last date of followup was May 15, 2017. Followup during active surveillance was performed with prostate specific antigen tests every 3 to 6 months and repeat biopsies every 2 to 4 years. Triggers for radical prostatectomy were disease progression based on prostate specific antigen, grade and/or stage, or patient request. Outcomes included adverse pathology findings at radical prostatectomy, defined as Gleason score greater than 3 + 4, extraprostatic extension, positive margins, seminal vesicle invasion and/or N+, whether the index tumor at radical prostatectomy was identified at biopsy and prostate specific antigen relapse-free survival.

Aim of the study:   To establish the potential of K. flammea for the treatment of prostate cancer, evaluating its cytotoxic activity, its probable mechanism of action, and carrying out some toxicological safety studies.  Materials and methods:   The cytotoxic activity of the ethyl acetate extract of K. flammea (Kf-EtOAc) was evaluated in several cell lines of prostate cancer by MTT viability assay. The cellular death mechanism was studied by evaluating the translocation of phosphatidylserine (Annexin V); overproduction of reactive oxygen species [2'-7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay]; release of Cytochrome C; activation of caspase-3 and -9, and regulation of Bcl-2, XIAP, and PKCε proteins by Western Blot analysis. For the evaluation of the safety of Kf-EtOAc, the Ames test, Micronucleus assay, and acute toxicity study were determined.  Results:   Kf-EtOAc exhibited selective cytotoxic activity against prostate cell lines as follows: PC-3, LNCaP, and PrEC (IC50 = 1.36 ± 0.05; 2.06 ± 0.02, and 127.05 ± 0.07 μg/mL, respectively). The F82-P2 fraction (rich in coumaric acid and palmitic acid) obtained by bioassay-guided fractionation of Kf-EtOAc also demonstrated selective cytotoxic activity against PC-3 cells (IC50 = 1.05 ± 0.06 μg/mL). Kf-EtOAc induces apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway; this mechanism of cell death was confirmed after observing that the extract produces phosphatidylserine translocation, overproduction of reactive oxygen species, release of Cytochrome C at mitochondrial level, and activation of caspase-3 and -9. It was also observed that Kf-EtOAc produces significant downregulation of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, XIAP, and PKCε and induces DNA fragmentation and cell cycle arrest.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathological data of 1,010 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. After excluding patients who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and those without a nadir PSA level<0.2ng/ml, the remaining 779 patients were enrolled. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as elevation of PSA to >0.2ng/ml. We investigated the PSA doubling time (PSA-DT) following BCR at various times after surgery.  Results:   During a mean follow-up of 8.8 years, BCR occurred in 180/779 patients. The annual BCR rate was 6% in the first year after surgery, 6% between 1 and 2 years, 3% between 2 and 3 years, 3% between 3 and 5 years, and 2% at >5 years postoperatively. During these periods, the minimum PSA-DT after BCR was 1.6, 2.4, 3.1, 6.1, and 6.4 months, respectively. These minimum PSA-DTs were used to determine the optimal follow-up interval during each period after surgery. If the baseline level is 0.1ng/ml, PSA should be measured at approximately 3-month intervals for the first year, at 4-month intervals between 1 and 2 years, at 6-month intervals between 2 and 3 years, and annually thereafter to definitely detect BCR before the serum PSA level exceeds 0.4ng/ml.

This work aimed to derive and validate a hypoxia-related mRNA signature for localized prostate cancer.  Method:   Hypoxia genes were identified in vitro via RNA-sequencing and combined with in vivo gene co-expression analysis to generate a signature. The signature was independently validated in eleven prostate cancer cohorts and a bladder cancer phase III randomized trial of radiotherapy alone or with carbogen and nicotinamide (CON).  Results:   A 28-gene signature was derived. Patients with high signature scores had poorer biochemical recurrence free survivals in six of eight independent cohorts of prostatectomy-treated patients (Log rank test P < .05), with borderline significances achieved in the other two (P < .1). The signature also predicted biochemical recurrence in patients receiving post-prostatectomy radiotherapy (n = 130, P = .007) or definitive radiotherapy alone (n = 248, P = .035). Lastly, the signature predicted metastasis events in a pooled cohort (n = 631, P = .002). Prognostic significance remained after adjusting for clinic-pathological factors and commercially available prognostic signatures. The signature predicted benefit from hypoxia-modifying therapy in bladder cancer patients (intervention-by-signature interaction test P = .0026), where carbogen and nicotinamide was associated with improved survival only in hypoxic tumours.

Associations between greater use of advanced imaging and less-aggressive end-of-life care in real-world practice has not been examined.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of SEER-Medicare data on patients who died from breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer between 2002 and 2007. Hospital referral region (HRR)-level use of computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography was categorized by tertile of imaging use and correlated with hospice enrollment overall and late hospice enrollment using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   A total of 55,058 patients met study criteria. Hospice use ranged from 50.8% (colorectal cancer) to 62.1% (prostate cancer). In multivariable analyses, hospital referral regions (HRRs) with high rates of CT imaging were associated with lower odds of hospice enrollment (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.90) and late enrollment among those who did enroll (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.26-1.76). HRRs with the highest rates of CT use were predominantly located in the Midwest and Northeast and associated with higher percentage population of black patients (14.5 vs 5.6%), greater comorbidity (28.4 vs 23.7%), metropolitan residence (93.9 vs 78.5%), and less than high school education (26.4 vs 19.3%).  Conclusion:   In this population-based retrospective study, we did not observe evidence that overall and timely hospice are associated with higher rates of imaging near the end of life. An observed association between higher rates of imaging, particularly CT, may be explained in part by HRR-level differences in practice patterns and patient demographic characteristics.

Primary nurses in the study settings aim to individualize care for their patients. The individual characteristics of patients may determine their perceptions of nursing care, and provide guidance in tailoring their care. This study aimed to assess patients' personal characteristics on their perceptions of individualized care (IC) provided by nurses during a course of radiotherapy, and to determine predictor variables that may inform nursing practice.  Methods:   This cross-sectional, exploratory study was conducted in three radiotherapy departments in Australia. Patients (n = 250) completed the Individualized Care Scale_Patient (ICS_P). Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, univariate analysis, and multiple regression analysis.  Results:   Males reported significantly higher perceptions of IC than females in 7/9 subscales. Patients with head and neck and prostate cancer, as well as those requiring hospitalization during radiotherapy, scored significantly higher in 5/9 subscales. Courses > 30 days, those not receiving chemotherapy, and partnered patients reported greater IC across all subscales. Gender and hospitalization were the main predictor variables for IC.  Conclusion:   Patients reported moderately high levels of IC during their radiotherapy; however, standard demographic information may provide limited insight into improving care for the individual. Patient characteristics routinely chosen, such as age, gender, and education may not predict how patients perceive their care or support the tailoring of interventions to improve IC. Researching a range of related patient characteristics may prove a more useful concept for future nursing studies aiming to predict outcomes to tailor nursing practice.""","""['Pauline M Rose']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""[""Individualized Care in the Radiation Oncology Setting From the Patients' and Nurses' Perspectives."", ""Caring behaviours in cancer care in Greece.

Propranolol was reported to block the late phase of autophagy. Hence, we hypothesized that in condition enhancing autophagy flux, cancer cells should be especially sensitive to propranolol. 2DG, a glycolysis inhibitor, is an anti-tumor agent having limited effect in monotherapy notably due to induction of pro-survival autophagy. Here, we report that treatment of cancer cells with propranolol in combination with the glycolysis inhibitor 2DG induced a massive accumulation of autophagosome due to autophagy blockade. The propranolol +2DG treatment efficiently prevents prostate cancer cell proliferation, induces cell apoptosis, alters mitochondrial morphology, inhibits mitochondrial bioenergetics and aggravates ER stress in vitro and also suppresses tumor growth in vivo.

Methods: This was a pilot study of patients from a tertiary cancer hospital who required insertion of gold fiducials for prostate cancer radiation therapy. Participation did not affect cancer management. Ultrasound-guided transperineal intraprostatic injection of a PET tracer (iron oxide nanocolloid labeled with 68Ga) was performed after placement of the fiducials. PET/CT lymphoscintigraphy imaging took place at approximately 45 and 100 min after injection of the tracer.

Methods:18F-fluciclovine PET data from 2 PET/MRI studies-one for staging of high-risk prostate cancer (28 patients) and one for diagnosis of recurrent prostate cancer (81 patients)-were reconstructed with a 4-compartment (reference) and 5-compartment attenuation map. In the latter, continuous linear attenuation coefficients for bone were included by coregistration with an atlas. The SUVmax and mean 50% isocontour SUV (SUViso) of primary, locally recurrent, and metastatic lesions were compared between the 2 reconstruction methods using linear mixed-effects models. In addition, mean SUVs were obtained from bone marrow in the third lumbar vertebra (L3) to investigate the effect of including bone attenuation on lesion-to-bone marrow SUV ratios (SUVRmax and SUVRiso; recurrence study only). The 5-compartment attenuation maps were visually compared with the in-phase Dixon MR images for evaluation of bone registration errors near the lesions. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Sixty-two lesions from 39 patients were evaluated. Bone registration errors were found near 19 (31%) of these lesions. In the remaining 8 primary prostate tumors, 7 locally recurrent lesions, and 28 lymph node metastases without bone registration errors, use of the 5-compartment attenuation map was associated with small but significant increases in SUVmax (2.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0%-3.0%; P < 0.001) and SUViso (2.5%; 95% CI, 1.9%-3.0%; P < 0.001), but not SUVRmax (0.2%; 95% CI, -0.5%-0.9%; P = 0.604) and SUVRiso (0.2%; 95% CI -0.6%-1.0%; P = 0.581), in comparison to the 4-compartment attenuation map.

The purpose of this study was to optimize 89Zr-oxine labeling of CAR T cells and evaluate PET as a platform for imaging adoptively transferred CAR T cells. Methods: CAR T cells were labeled with 0-1.4 MBq of 89Zr-oxine per 106 cells and assessed for radioactivity retention, viability, and functionality. In vivo trafficking of 89Zr-oxine-labeled CAR T cells was evaluated in 2 murine xenograft tumor models: glioblastoma brain tumors with intracranially delivered IL13Rα2-targeted CAR T cells, and subcutaneous prostate tumors with intravenously delivered prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA)-targeted CAR T cells.

Metastases showed more expression of neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin compared to prostatectomies (6.3% of cells vs. 1.0%, p < 0.001 and 4.0% vs. 0.4%, p < 0.001, respectively). At least focal expression of one of the markers was seen in 78% of metastases. Strong expression was relatively uncommon, seen in 3/89 (chromogranin A), 8/89 (neuron specific enolase), and 5/89 (synaptophysin) metastases. Expression of chromogranin A and synaptophysin correlated with each other (r = 0.64, p < 0.001), but expression of neuron specific enolase did not correlate with the two other markers. Extent of NED varied significantly between different metastatic sites in individual patients. Absent androgen receptor expression was associated with strong expression of chromogranin A (p = .02) and neuron specific enolase (p = .02), but not with focal expression of any marker. No clear association was found between expression of NE markers and ERG or Ki-67. In conclusion, NED is a common and heterogeneous phenomenon in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. NED is more often present in castration-resistant prostate cancer compared to hormone-naïve disease, and it is associated with androgen receptor negativity. More research is needed to understand significance of NED in the progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Miika Sainio', 'Tapio Visakorpi', 'Teemu Tolonen', 'Joanna Ilvesaro', 'G Steven Bova']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Elevated circulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) levels are associated with neuroendocrine differentiation in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Metastatic Conventional Prostate Cancer Is Significantly Increased in Lymph Node Metastases Compared to the Primary Tumors.', 'Influence of abiraterone acetate on neuroendocrine differentiation in chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Selected markers (chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, protein gene product 9.5) in diagnosis and prognosis of neuroendocrine pulmonary tumours.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in castration resistant prostate cancer.

In the current study, the authors investigated the association between 3-month post-RT PSA level and biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS).  Methods:   A total of 5783 patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk localized prostate cancer who were diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 and treated with RT and androgen deprivation therapy were identified from Veterans Affairs data. Patients were divided into groups based on 3-month post-RT PSA values: <0.10 ng/mL, 0.10 to 0.49 ng/mL, and ≥0.50 ng/mL. The effect of the 3-month PSA group on bPFS, PCSS, and OS was evaluated in multivariable Cox models adjusting for potential confounders.  Results:   There were 2651 patients with intermediate-risk and 3132 with high-risk disease; approximately 11% had a 3-month PSA level of ≥0.50 ng/mL. A higher 3-month PSA level was found to be strongly associated with each outcome; compared with patients in the group with a 3-month PSA value <0.10 ng/mL, the authors noted greater hazards for the patients with a 3-month PSA value ≥0.50 ng/mL (hazard ratio for bPFS: 5.23; PCSS: 3.97; and OS: 1.50 [P<.001 for all]) and the patients with a 3-month PSA value of 0.10 to 0.49 ng/mL (hazard ratio for bPFS: 2.41 [P<.001]; PCSS: 2.29 [P<.001]; and OS: 1.21 [P = .003]). When analyzed separately, the 3-month PSA level was found to be predictive of OS in the high-risk group (P<.001) but not the intermediate-risk group (P = .21).  Conclusions:   The 3-month post-RT PSA level appears to be a strong prognostic biomarker for bPFS, PCSS, and OS in patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer, particularly those with high-risk disease. The 3-month PSA measurement may augment clinical decision making and holds promise as a potential surrogate endpoint in clinical trials.

Patients and methods:   Retrospective analysis of 13 924 RP patients in a single institution (2005-2015). Complications were collected during hospital stay and via standardised questionnaire 3 months after, and grouped into eight schemes. Since 2013, the revised Clavien-Dindo classification was used (n = 4 379). Annual incidence rates of different complications were graphically displayed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses compared complications between ORP and RALP after inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).  Results:   After the introduction of standardised classification systems, complication rates have increased with a contemporary rate of 20.6% (2013-2015). While minor Clavien-Dindo grades represented the majority (I: 10.6%; II: 7.9%), severe complications (Grades IV-V) were rare (<1%). In logistic regression analyses after IPTW, RALP was associated with less blood loss, shorter catheterisation time, and lower risk of Clavien-Dindo Grade II and III complications.

Existing methods typically employ several separate steps, each of which is optimized individually without considering the error tolerance of other steps. As a result, they could either involve unnecessary computational cost or suffer from errors accumulated over steps. In this paper, we present an automated CS PCa detection system, where all steps are optimized jointly in an end-to-end trainable deep neural network. The proposed neural network consists of concatenated subnets: 1) a novel tissue deformation network (TDN) for automated prostate detection and multimodal registration and 2) a dual-path convolutional neural network (CNN) for CS PCa detection. Three types of loss functions, i.e., classification loss, inconsistency loss, and overlap loss, are employed for optimizing all parameters of the proposed TDN and CNN. In the training phase, the two nets mutually affect each other and effectively guide registration and extraction of representative CS PCa-relevant features to achieve results with sufficient accuracy. The entire network is trained in a weakly supervised manner by providing only image-level annotations (i.e., presence/absence of PCa) without exact priors of lesions' locations. Compared with most existing systems which require supervised labels, e.g., manual delineation of PCa lesions, it is much more convenient for clinical usage. Comprehensive evaluation based on fivefold cross validation using 360 patient data demonstrates that our system achieves a high accuracy for CS PCa detection, i.e., a sensitivity of 0.6374 and 0.8978 at 0.1 and 1 false positives per normal/benign patient.""","""['Zhiwei Wang', 'Chaoyue Liu', 'Danpeng Cheng', 'Liang Wang', 'Xin Yang', 'Kwang-Ting Cheng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Co-trained convolutional neural networks for automated detection of prostate cancer in multi-parametric MRI.', 'Automated diagnosis of prostate cancer in multi-parametric MRI based on multimodal convolutional neural networks.', 'Computer-aided diagnosis of prostate cancer on magnetic resonance imaging using a convolutional neural network algorithm.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Computer-aided Detection of Prostate Cancer with MRI: Technology and Applications.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Diagnosis from Optic Disc Photographs Using a Siamese Network.', 'Predicting clinically significant prostate cancer with a deep learning approach: a multicentre retrospective study.', 'Fully automated detection and localization of clinically significant prostate cancer on MR images using a cascaded convolutional neural network.', 'PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS WITH SPARSE BIOPSY DATA AND IN PRESENCE OF LOCATION UNCERTAINTY.']"""

Results:   The change from pre-treatment score for the minimal, moderate and severe symptom groups was: 3.6-7.3 (P < 0.001), 11.6-11.3 (P = 0.426), and 24.1-16.9 (P < 0.001). For those with minimal symptoms the 10- and 15-year estimates for freedom from worse symptoms were 72.9% and 39.1%, respectively. Cox HRs were significant for EBRT boost (HR 1.45, P = 0.004), RT dose >200 Gy2 (HR 1.25, P = 0.024), hypertension (HR 1.37, P = 0.006), and alcohol use (HR 1.46, P = 0.001).  Conclusion:   A substantial number of men with initial low AUASS treated by BT experience worsening urinary symptoms with long-term follow-up. Use of EBRT, RT dose, hypertension and alcohol use are risk factors for an increase in urinary symptom score.""","""['Nelson N Stone', 'Jared S Winoker', 'Steven A Kaplan', 'Richard G Stock']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Brachytherapy improves biochemical failure-free survival in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer compared with conventionally fractionated external beam radiation therapy: a propensity score matched analysis.', 'Prospective assessment of patient-reported long-term urinary morbidity and associated quality of life changes after 125I prostate brachytherapy.', 'Brachytherapy Boost Utilization and Survival in Unfavorable-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Urinary morbidity and incontinence following transurethral resection of the prostate after brachytherapy.', 'Permanent interstitial low-dose-rate brachytherapy for patients with localised prostate cancer: a systematic review of randomised and nonrandomised controlled clinical trials.', 'Analysis of quality of life after randomized controlled trial of alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist alone and in combination with cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor in patients who underwent low-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Relapse after surgery or radiotherapy of curative intent is not uncommon and, in part, represents a failure of staging with current diagnostic imaging techniques to detect disease spread. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is a new whole-body scanning technique that enables visualization of PCa with high contrast. The hypotheses of this study are that: (i) PSMA-PET/CT has improved diagnostic performance compared with conventional imaging; (ii) PSMA-PET/CT should be used as a first-line diagnostic test for staging; (iii) the improved diagnostic performance of PSMA-PET/CT will result in significant management impact; and (iv) there are economic benefits if PSMA-PET/CT is incorporated into the management algorithm.  Objectives and methods:   The proPSMA trial is a prospective, multicentre study in which patients with untreated high-risk PCa will be randomized to gallium-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT or conventional imaging, consisting of CT of the abdomen/pelvis and bone scintigraphy with single-photon emission CT/CT. Patients eligible for inclusion are those with newly diagnosed PCa with select high-risk features, defined as International Society of Urological Pathology grade group ≥3 (primary Gleason grade 4, or any Gleason grade 5), prostate-specific antigen level ≥20 ng/mL or clinical stage ≥T3. Patients with negative, equivocal or oligometastatic disease on first line-imaging will cross over to receive the other imaging arm. The primary objective is to compare the accuracy of PSMA-PET/CT with that of conventional imaging for detecting nodal or distant metastatic disease. Histopathological, imaging and clinical follow-up at 6 months will define the primary endpoint according to a predefined scoring system. Secondary objectives include comparing management impact, the number of equivocal studies, the incremental value of second-line imaging in patients who cross over, the cost of each imaging strategy, radiation exposure, inter-observer agreement and safety of PSMA-PET/CT. Longer-term follow-up will also assess the prognostic value of a negative PSMA-PET/CT.  Outcome and significance:   This trial will provide data to establish whether PSMA-PET/CT should replace conventional imaging in the primary staging of select high-risk localized PCa, or whether it should be used to provide incremental diagnostic information in selected cases.""","""['Michael S Hofman', 'Declan G Murphy', 'Scott G Williams', 'Tatenda Nzenza', 'Alan Herschtal', 'Richard De Abreu Lourenco', 'Dale L Bailey', 'Ray Budd', 'Rodney J Hicks', 'Roslyn J Francis', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET-CT in patients with high-risk prostate cancer before curative-intent surgery or radiotherapy (proPSMA): a prospective, randomised, multicentre study.', 'Protocol for the PRIMARY clinical trial, a prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional study of the additive diagnostic value of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography/computed tomography to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnostic setting for men being investigated for prostate cancer.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'The role of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography in primary staging of prostate cancer.', 'The Impact of PSMA PET/CT on Modern Prostate Cancer Management and Decision Making-The Urological Perspective.', 'PSMA PET/CT: joint EANM procedure guideline/SNMMI procedure standard for prostate cancer imaging 2.0.', '18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT-derived semi-quantitative parameters for risk stratification of newly diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'Super Early Scan of PSMA PET/CT in Evaluating Primary and Metastatic Lesions of Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.']"""

A convenient solution may be non-invasive liquid biopsy testing of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). For this reason, CTC-enriched samples obtained by immunomagnetic separation (AdnaTest®) were studied as a source material for high-throughput gene expression analysis using BioMark™.  Patients and methods:   CTC-enriched samples from 41 CRPC patients previously determined to be CTC positive using the AdnaTest® were retrospectively re-analysed for androgen receptor (AR) messenger RNA (mRNA), using the updated AdnaTest®. Blood samples were drawn two times from each patient: at the time of CRPC diagnosis and after the third docetaxel cycle. A gene expression panel of 27 genes related to CRPC therapeutic decision-making, including AR full length (ARFL) and splice variant 7 (ARV7), was retrospectively analyzed on a BioMark™ platform in 29 of 41 patients.  Results:   The AdnaTest® detected AR mRNA in three-quarters of CTC-positive samples taken at the time of CRPC diagnosis and after the third docetaxel cycle. AR detection was associated with a shorter disease-specific survival (45.0 vs. 20.4 months) at the time of CRPC diagnosis. ARFL expression at the time of CRPC diagnosis, measured on the BioMark™ platform, was associated with a lower decrease of serum level of prostate-specific antigen (sPSA) (p = 0.029), i.e., worse therapy response. ARV7 was found in 38% of the ARFL--positive samples at both analyzed timepoints.  Conclusion:   Detection of AR expression by AdnaTest® in CTC-enriched samples may help predict patients' survival. These AdnaTest® CTC-enriched samples can be used in a high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of gene expression, provided that the specificity of the assay for each individual gene is properly validated.

Methods:   A total of 142 patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer underwent PET/CT with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC (68Ga-PSMA-11). Quantitative assessment of all 641 68Ga-PSMA-11-positive lesions in the field of view was performed to calculate PSMA-derived parameters, including whole-body PSMA tumor volume (PSMA-TV) and whole-body total lesion PSMA (TL-PSMA), as well as the established SUVmax and SUVmean values. All PET-derived parameters were tested for correlation with serum PSA levels and for association with Gleason scores. In 23 patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT before and after therapy with either external beam radiation, androgen deprivation, or docetaxel chemotherapy, SUVmax and TL-PSMA were compared to radiographic response assessment of CT images based on RECIST 1.1 criteria and to biochemical response determined by changes of serum PSA levels.  Results:   PSMA-TV and TL-PSMA demonstrated a significant correlation with serum PSA levels (P < 0.0001) and TL-PSMA was significantly different for different Gleason scores. The agreement rate between TL-PSMA derived from PET and biochemical response was 87% (95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.97; Cohen's κ = 0.78; P < 0.01) and, thus, higher than for SUVmax, which was 74% (95% CI, 0.52-0.90; κ = 0.55; P < 0.01). Furthermore, agreement with PSA was higher for TL-PSMA and SUVmax than for CT-based response evaluation. Discordant findings between PET and CT were most likely due to limitations of CT and RECIST in rating small lymph nodes as metastases, as well as bone involvement, which was sometimes not detectable in CT.  Conclusion: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-derived metabolic tumor parameters showed promising results for evaluation of treatment response. Especially, TL-PSMA demonstrated higher agreement rates with biochemical response compared to SUVmax.

Although both the urologist and the medical oncologist play important roles in the management of patients with advanced PCa, there is limited information regarding their role in the context of skeletal complications. The current study investigated these relationships among newly diagnosed metastatic patients with PCa.  Methods and materials:   This retrospective cohort study used Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry data for incident stage IV metastatic (M1) cases diagnosed from 2000 to 2007 with linked Medicare claims. Postdiagnosis urologist and medical oncologist visits were identified using billing codes. We considered skeletal-related events (SREs) that occurred after the urologist or medical oncologist visit. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the relationship between a physician visit and the timing of the first SRE with and without propensity-score matching to account for observable selection.  Results:   The sample included 5,572 patients with stage IV M1 prostate cancer. Seventy-six percent of the patients were non-Hispanic White, 16% were non-Hispanic African American, and 8% were of other races; 75% of patients saw a urologist (median time to first visit = 19 days) and 44% saw an oncologist (median = 80 days), whereas 41% experienced at least one SRE (median = 309 days). Covariate-adjusted Cox models showed a longer time to an SRE for patients with only a medical oncologist visit (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.45-0.61), only a urologist visit (HR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.31-0.39) or both a urologist and medical oncologist visit (HR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.31-0.38), compared to individuals without these visits. Among men with a urologist visit, a medical oncologist visit was not associated with the time to the first SRE (HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.90-1.05). Among those without a urologist visit a medical oncologist visit was associated with a longer time to an SRE (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.46-0.64). Results were comparable using propensity-score matched samples.  Conclusion:   Among men newly diagnosed with metastatic PCa, 4 of 10 patients experienced an SRE.

In 2003 Pomel first described laparoscopic pelvic exenteration, since then very few reports have described minimally invasive approaches for total pelvic exenteration. Methods: We report the 10 cases of locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma which were operated between the periods from March 1, 2017 to November 11, 2017 at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai. All male patients had lower rectal cancer with prostate involvement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). One female patient had uterine and fornix involvement. All perioperative and intraoperative parameters were collected retrospectively from prospectively maintained electronic data. Results: Nine male patients with diagnosis of nonmetastatic locally advanced lower rectal adenocarcinoma were selected. All patients were operated with minimally invasive approach. All patients underwent abdominoperineal resection with permanent sigmoid stoma. Ileal conduit was constructed with Bricker's procedure through small infraumbilical incision (4-5 cm). Lateral pelvic lymph node dissection was done only when postchemoradiotherapy MRI showed enlarged pelvic nodes. All 10 patients received neoadjuvant chemo radiotherapy, whereas 8 patients received additional neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Mean body mass index was 21.73 (range 19.5-26.3). Mean blood loss was 1000 mL (range 300-2000 mL). Mean duration of surgery was 9.13 hours (range 7-13 hours). One patient developed paralytic ileus, which was managed conservatively. One patient developed intestinal obstruction due to herniation of small intestine behind the left ureter and ileal conduit. The same patient developed acute pylonephritis, which was managed with antibiotics. Mean postoperative stay was 14.6 days (range 9-25 days). On postoperative histopathology, all margins were free of tumor in all cases. Conclusion: Minimally invasive approaches can be used safely for total pelvic exenteration in locally advanced lower rectal adenocarcinoma. All patients had fast recovery with less blood loss. In all patients R0 resection was achieved with adequate margins. Long-term oncological outcomes are still uncertain and will require further follow-up.""","""['Ashish Pokharkar', 'Praveen Kammar', ""Ashwin D'souza"", 'Rahul Bhamre', 'Pavan Sugoor', 'Avanish Saklani']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Laparoendosc Adv Surg Tech A""","""['Laparoscopic Posterior Pelvic Exenteration (Complete and Supralevator) for Locally Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Rectum in Females: Surgical Technique and Short-Term Outcomes.', 'Laparoscopic Total Pelvic Exenteration for Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer.', 'Total pelvic exenteration and rectal cancer.

We sought to better understand PCa molecular diversity that may be underlying these disparities. We performed RNA-sequencing analysis on high-grade PCa to identify genes showing differential tumor versus noncancer adjacent tissue expression patterns unique to AAM or EAM. We observed that interleukin-6 (IL-6) was upregulated in the nonmalignant adjacent tissue in AAM, but in EAM IL-6 expression was higher in PCa tissue. Enrichment analysis identified that genes linked to the function of TP53 were overrepresented and downregulated in PCa tissue from AAM. These RNA-sequencing results informed our subsequent investigation of a diverse PCa cell line panel. We observed that PCa cell lines that are TP53 wild-type, which includes cell lines derived from AAM (MDA-PCa-2b and RC77T), did not express detectable IL-6 mRNA. IL-6 treatment of these cells downregulated wild-type TP53 protein and induced mRNA and protein expression of the epigenetic reader methyl CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2), specifically the alternative mRNA splicing variant MBD2_v2. Further investigation validated that upregulation of this short isoform promotes self-renewal and expansion of PCa cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). In conclusion, this report contributes to characterizing gene expression patterns in high-grade PCa and adjacent noncancer tissues from EAM and AAM.

Patients with baseline circulating tumour cell (BLCTCs) counts <5/7.5 mL represent a good prognosis subgroup but are non-evaluable for response assessment (decrease in CTCs). The aim of the study is to determine the value of any increase in CTCs (CTC progression) as an indicator of progression in prostate cancer patients with low pre-treatment CTCs (<5).  Patients and methods:   We carried out a post hoc analysis of patients with BLCTCs < 5 treated in the COU-AA-301 (abiraterone or placebo + prednisone) and IMMC-38 (chemotherapy) trials. The association of CTC progression (increase in CTCs at 4, 8 or 12 weeks) with overall survival (OS) was evaluated in multi-variable Cox regression models. Performance of survival models with and without CTC progression was evaluated by calculating ROC curve area under the curves (AUCs) and weighted c-indices.  Results:   Overall, 511 patients with CTCs < 5 (421 in COU-AA-301 and 90 in IMMC-38) were selected; 212 (41.7%) had CTC progression at 4, 8 or 12 weeks after treatment initiation. CTC progression was associated with significantly worse OS [27.1 versus 15.1 m; hazard ratio (HR) 3.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.5-4.5; P < 0.001)], independent of baseline CTCs and established clinical variables. Adding CTC progression to the OS model significantly improved ROC AUC (0.77 versus 0.66; P < 0.001). Models including CTC progression had superior ROC AUC (0.77 versus 0.69; P < 0.001) and weighted c-index [0.750 versus 0.705; delta c-index: 0.045 (95% CI 0.019-0.071)] values than those including CTC conversion (increase to CTCs ≥ 5). In COU-AA-301, the impact of CTC progression was independent of treatment arm.  Conclusions:   Increasing CTCs during the first 12 weeks of treatment are independently associated with worse OS from advanced prostate cancer in patients with baseline CTCs < 5 treated with abiraterone or chemotherapy and improve models with established prognostic variables.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Urine samples were obtained from 203 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and 209 patients with prostate cancer. Levels of urinary sarcosine were measured using the sarcosine oxidase method. The urinary sarcosine/creatinine ratios were compared between the group of patients with BPH and the patients with prostate cancer. In the two patients groups, the urinary sarcosine/creatinine ratio was compared with the measurement of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and the free/total (F/T) PSA ratio. Correlations between of the urinary sarcosine/creatinine ratio and the Gleason grade and stage of prostate cancer were analyzed. RESULTS There was a significant difference between the urinary sarcosine/creatinine ratio in the BPH group and prostate cancer group (P<0.01), which was independent of serum PSA. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC) for the urinary sarcosine/creatinine ratio was significantly higher compared with the serum PSA and the F/T PSA ratio. There was a significant difference in the urinary sarcosine/creatinine ratio in patients with prostate cancer with Gleason score ≤6, 7, and ≥8, and between patients with metastatic and non-metastatic prostate cancer.

Perlecan/heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2) is an extracellular proteoglycan that orchestrates tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, differentiation and invasion. Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) cells degrade perlecan-rich tissue borders to reach bone, including the basement membrane, vasculature, reactive stromal matrix and bone marrow. Domain IV-3, perlecan's last 7 immunoglobulin repeats, mimics native proteoglycan by promoting tumoroid formation. This is reversed by matrilysin/matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) cleavage to favor cell dispersion and tumoroid dyscohesion. Both perlecan and Domain IV-3 induced a strong focal adhesion kinase (FAK) dephosphorylation/deactivation. MMP-7 cleavage of perlecan reversed this, with FAK in dispersed tumoroids becoming phosphorylated/activated with metastatic phenotype. We demonstrated Domain IV-3 interacts with the axon guidance protein semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) on PCa cells to deactivate pro-metastatic FAK. Sema3A antibody mimicked the Domain IV-3 clustering activity. Direct binding experiments showed Domain IV-3 binds Sema3A. Knockdown of Sema3A prevented Domain IV-3-induced tumoroid formation and Sema3A was sensitive to MMP-7 proteolysis. The perlecan-Sema3A complex abrogates FAK activity and stabilizes PCa cell interactions. MMP-7 expressing cells destroy the complex to initiate metastasis, destroy perlecan-rich borders, and favor invasion and progression to lethal bone disease.""","""['Brian J Grindel', 'Jerahme R Martinez', 'Tristen V Tellman', 'Daniel A Harrington', 'Hamim Zafar', 'Luay Nakhleh', 'Leland W Chung', 'Mary C Farach-Carson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Matrilysin/matrix metalloproteinase-7(MMP7) cleavage of perlecan/HSPG2 creates a molecular switch to alter prostate cancer cell behavior.', 'Cleavage of the Perlecan-Semaphorin 3A-Plexin A1-Neuropilin-1 (PSPN) Complex by Matrix Metalloproteinase 7/Matrilysin Triggers Prostate Cancer Cell Dyscohesion and Migration.', 'Perlecan/HSPG2 and matrilysin/MMP-7 as indices of tissue invasion: tissue localization and circulating perlecan fragments in a cohort of 288 radical prostatectomy patients.', 'Border patrol: insights into the unique role of perlecan/heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 at cell and tissue borders.', 'Flipping the Molecular Switch: Influence of Perlecan and Its Modifiers in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Important Cells and Factors from Tumor Microenvironment Participated in Perineural Invasion.', 'Theranostic Applications of Glycosaminoglycans in Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'HSPG2 Mutation Association with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Outcome in Melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Substituted Syndecan-2-Derived Mimetic Peptides Show Improved Antitumor Activity over the Parent Syndecan-2-Derived Peptide.']"""

Consequently, these miRNAs have been studied as cell-autonomous tumor suppressors and oncogenes. However, the cell-type specificity of these miRNAs is not well defined in prostate tissue. Through two different microdissection techniques, and droplet digital RT-PCR, we quantified these miRNAs in the stroma and epithelium of radical prostatectomy specimens. In contrast to their purported roles as cell-autonomous tumor suppressors, we found miR-1 and miR-143 expression to be predominantly stromal. Conversely, miR-141 was predominantly epithelial. miR-21 was detected in both stroma and epithelium. Strikingly, the levels of miR-1 and miR-143 were significantly reduced in tumor-associated stroma, but not tumor epithelium. Gene expression analyses in human cell lines, tissues, and prostate-derived stromal cultures support the cell-type selective expression of miR-1, miR-141, and miR-143. Analyses of the PCa Genome Atlas (TCGA-PRAD) showed a strong positive correlation between stromal markers and miR-1 and miR-143, and a strong negative correlation between stromal markers and miR-141.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 60 mHSPC patients (median age 72 years) treated with ADT whose laboratory data at baseline and following 12 weeks were available.  Results:   Forty-four patients (73%) had PSA progression and 27 patients (45.0%) died during a median follow-up of 34 months. The multivariable Cox hazard model demonstrated that a log-transformed baseline PSA level (p = 0.003) and an extent of bone disease (EOD) score of ≥3 (p = 0.004) were statistically associated with an increased risk for PSA progression whereas one unit increase in a log-transformed PSA change (baseline-12 weeks) was associated with a decreased risk for PSA progression (p = 0.004). For overall survival, a high level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 12 weeks was associated with increased risk (p = 0.030) whereas a one-unit increase in the log-transformed PSA change was associated with decreased risk (p = 0.001).  Conclusions:   An increased level of PSA at baseline, or an EOD score of ≥3 may be a good predictor of PSA progression, and a high level of ALP at 12 weeks may be a risk predictor of death. A larger decline in PSA at 12 weeks from the baseline was associated with both PSA progression-free and overall survival time.

There were no such severe complications as vascular injury and rectum perforation. The patients were followed up for 6－48 (mean 42) months, during which, biochemical recurrence was observed in 12 cases at a median of 12 months postoperatively and 2 patients died at 12 and 48 months respectively.  Conclusions:   Bilateral PLG and lymph node aspiration for examination of the mRNA expressions of PSA and PSMA in the lymph fluid help to confirm PLNM preoperatively. Radical retropubic prostatectomy with adjuvant androgen deprivation or external radiotherapy is safe and effective for the treatment of PCa with PLNM, but it should be chosen cautiously for those with Gleason 5+5.""","""['Ding-Yi Liu', 'Sang Hu', 'Yan-Feng Zhou', 'Hong-Chao He', 'Jia-Shun Yu', 'Jian Wang', 'Wei-Mu Xia', 'Qi Tang', 'Ming-Wei Wang', 'Wen-Long Zhou']""","""[]""","""2017""","""None""","""Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue""","""['The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Detection of circulating prostate cells during radical prostatectomy by standardized PSMA RT-PCR: association with positive lymph nodes and high malignant grade.', 'Assessment of optimal target genes for detecting micrometastases in pelvic lymph nodes in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.', 'The role of radical prostatectomy and lymph node dissection in lymph node-positive prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Management of positive lymph nodes following radical prostatectomy.']"""

Results:   The level of serum adiponectin was decreased in the PCa patients as compared with the controls and it was negatively correlated with the Gleason scores. Adiponectin suppressed the proliferation, migration and tube formation of the PC-3 cells and inhibited them from transforming into S-stage cells.

Patients were assessed 2 weeks prior to biopsy, at biopsy and 2 weeks after. Primary end point was occurrence of post-TBICs that included simple UTI, febrile UTI or sepsis. Secondary end points were post-biopsy change in the inflammatory markers (TLC, ESR and CRP), unplanned visits, hospitalization and occurrence of fluoroquinolones resistance (FQ-R; bacterial growth on MacConkey agar plate with 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin) in the fecal carriage of screened men.

Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) catalyzes the concluding step in glycolysis and is a key regulator of tumor growth and metabolism. Elevation of PKM2 expression was detected in Gleason 8-10 tumors compared to Gleason 6-7 carcinomas, indicating that PKM2 may potentially be a marker of aggressive prostate cancer. We have recently reported the development of a PKM2-specific radiopharmaceutical [18F]DASA-23 and herein describe its evaluation in cell culture and preclinical models of prostate cancer.  Procedure:   The cellular uptake of [18F]DASA-23 was evaluated in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines and compared to that of [18F]FDG. The specificity of [18F]DASA-23 to measure PKM2 levels in cell culture was additionally confirmed through the use of PKM2-specific siRNA. PET imaging studies were then completed utilizing subcutaneous prostate cancer xenografts using either PC3 or DU145 cells in mice.  Results:   [18F]DASA-23 uptake values over 60-min incubation period in PC3, LnCAP, and DU145 respectively were 23.4 ± 4.5, 18.0 ± 2.1, and 53.1 ± 4.6 % tracer/mg protein. Transient reduction in PKM2 protein expression with siRNA resulted in a 50.1 % reduction in radiotracer uptake in DU145 cells. Small animal PET imaging revealed 0.86 ± 0.13 and 1.6 ± 0.2 % ID/g at 30 min post injection of radioactivity in DU145 and PC3 subcutaneous tumor bearing mice respectively.

We analyzed 184 patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer and divided them into three PSA level groups as follows: low (<100 ng ml-1), intermediate (100-999 ng ml-1), and high (≥1000 ng ml-1). All patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) immediately. We investigated PSA progression-free survival (PFS) for first-line ADT and overall survival (OS) within each of the three groups. Furthermore, we analyzed response to antiandrogen withdrawal (AW) and alternative antiandrogen (AA) therapies after development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). No significant differences in OS were observed among the three groups (P = 0.654). Patients with high PSA levels had significantly short PFS for first-line ADT (P = 0.037). Conversely, patients in the high PSA level group had significantly longer PFS when treated with AW than those in the low PSA level group (P = 0.047). Furthermore, patients with high PSA levels had significantly longer PFS when provided with AA therapy (P = 0.049). PSA responders to AW and AA therapies had significantly longer survival after CRPC development than nonresponders (P = 0.011 and P < 0.001, respectively).

Nuclear IGF1R reportedly associates with clinical response to IGF1R inhibitory drugs, yet its role in the nucleus is poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the significance of nuclear IGF1R in clinical cancers and cell line models. In prostate cancers, IGF1R was predominantly membrane localized in benign glands, while malignant epithelium contained prominent internalized (nuclear/cytoplasmic) IGF1R, and nuclear IGF1R associated significantly with advanced tumor stage. Using ChIP-seq to assess global chromatin occupancy, we identified IGF1R-binding sites at or near transcription start sites of genes including JUN and FAM21, most sites coinciding with occupancy by RNA polymerase II (RNAPol2) and histone marks of active enhancers/promoters. IGF1R was inducibly recruited to chromatin, directly binding DNA and interacting with RNAPol2 to upregulate expression of JUN and FAM21, shown to mediate tumor cell survival and IGF-induced migration. IGF1 also enriched RNAPol2 on promoters containing IGF1R-binding sites. These functions were inhibited by IGF1/II-neutralizing antibody xentuzumab (BI 836845), or by blocking receptor internalization. We detected IGF1R on JUN and FAM21 promoters in fresh prostate cancers that contained abundant nuclear IGF1R, with evidence of correlation between nuclear IGF1R content and JUN expression in malignant prostatic epithelium. Taken together, these data reveal previously unrecognized molecular mechanisms through which IGFs promote tumorigenesis, with implications for therapeutic evaluation of anti-IGF drugs.Significance: These findings reveal a noncanonical nuclear role for IGF1R in tumorigenesis, with implications for therapeutic evaluation of IGF inhibitory drugs.

This led to dramatic reductions in the diagnosis of localized disease across all clinical risk groups.  Objective:   In light of decreased PSA screening for men in the US, we sought to study trends in newly diagnosed metastatic PCa incidence and how this may vary by race and age.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed new PCa incidence by stage at diagnosis between 1988 and 2015 within the Cancer Registry of Greater California. We further stratified the patients by age and four major race/ethnicity groups (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white [NHW], non-Hispanic black [NHB], and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander [API]). Incidence rates were calculated and compared per 100000 and age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population.  Outcome measurement and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was incidence of metastatic PCa at the time of cancer diagnosis. Joinpoint regression program was used to detect changes in incidence and to calculate the average percent change (APC) over time. All data were analyzed using SEER*Stat version 8.1.15 and Joinpoint Regression Program version 4.1.0, and a two-sided p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results and limitations:   Adjusted rates of metastatic PCa incidence for NHW men significantly increased by 4.3% since 2010, while remaining down (NHB, Hispanic) or level (API) for other racial groups. Stratified by age, incidence of metastatic disease for all races has increased significantly for men aged 64-75 yr since 2008 with an APC of 2.8% while remaining level for other age groups. The limitations of our study include retrospective design and no data on extent of PSA screening in the study cohort.  Conclusions:   Incidence rates of newly diagnosed metastatic PCa have significantly increased for NHW men and men aged 65-74 yr.  Patient summary:   Prostate-specific antigen screening has declined in the Unites States with a subsequent sharp drop in the incidence of screen-detected localized prostate cancer. The incidence of men presenting with metastatic disease seems to be rising recently, and men should continue to discuss the benefits of PSA screening with their primary care doctor.""","""[""Marc A Dall'Era"", 'Ralph deVere-White', 'Danielle Rodriguez', 'Rosemary Cress']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Patient Characteristics at Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in Different Races at an Academic Center Serving a Diverse Population.', 'Past, Current, and Future Incidence Rates and Burden of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the United States.', 'Racial and Ethnic Variation in PSA Testing and Prostate Cancer Incidence Following the 2012 USPSTF Recommendation.', 'Epidemiology of prostate cancer.', 'Epidemiology, pathology, and genetics of prostate cancer among African Americans compared with other ethnicities.', 'Personalizing approaches to the management of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: role of advanced imaging, genetics and therapeutics.', 'Trends in Incidence of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in the US.', 'Comprehensive signature analysis of drug metabolism differences in the White, Black and Asian prostate cancer patients.', 'Abiraterone vs. docetaxel for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A microsimulation model.', 'Management of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC): an Evolving Treatment Paradigm.']"""

Methods:   From 2000-2016, 228 patients received staging PLND before primary RT in a single tertiary care center. Nine patients were excluded for the evaluation of morbidity. Fifty patients were operated in an open approach, 96 laparoscopic and 73 robot-assisted (RA). Clavien-Dindo classification was used for evaluating complications. Predictors of biochemical recurrence (BCR), clinical relapse (CR), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated by regression analyses to determine a possible therapeutic effect.  Results:   Minimal invasive surgery (laparoscopic or RA) caused five times less major complications (22% vs. 4.3%, p = .001) and a median 3 days shorter hospital stay (5 days versus 2 days, p < .001). Major complications resulted in a delayed (23 days, p < .001) RT start but no oncological effect was seen. Independent oncological predictors were the number of positive nodes (BCR, CR, CSS, OS), a lower age (CR), a higher level of initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (BCR) and post-RT PSA (BCR).

Despite standardization efforts, many available PSA assays may still produce discordant results. In the present study, we compared four PSA assays calibrated to the WHO standards 96/670 and 96/668 for tPSA and fPSA, respectively.  Methods:   Within the scope of the Prostate Cancer Early Detection Study Based on a ''Baseline'' PSA Value in Young Men (PROBASE), we tested tPSA and fPSA in serum samples from 50 patients in the four different PROBASE sites using four WHO-calibrated assays from Roche (Elecsys, Cobas), Beckman-Coulter (Access-II) and Siemens (ADVIA Centaur). The comparison was performed using the Passing-Bablok regression method.  Results:   Compared to Access, the median tPSA levels for Centaur, Elecsys, and Cobas were +3%, +11%-20%, and +17%-23%, respectively, while for median fPSA levels the differences for Centaur, Elecsys, and Cobas were +49%, +29%-31%, and +22%, respectively.  Discussion:   Despite all investigated assays being WHO-calibrated, the Elecsys and Cobas tPSA assays produced considerably higher results than the Access and Centaur assays. Differences in fPSA-recovery between all investigated assays were even more pronounced. When applying the tPSA cutoff of 3.1 μg/L recommended for WHO-calibrated assays, the use of higher calibrated assays may lead to unnecessary prostate biopsies. Conversely, if the historical threshold of 4 μg/L is applied when using WHO-calibrated assays, it could lead to falsely omitted prostate biopsies.""","""['Martin Boegemann', 'Christian Arsov', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Kathleen Herkommer', 'Florian Imkamp', 'Jerzy-Roch Nofer', 'Joachim Gerß', 'Peter Albers', 'Axel Semjonow']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Biol Markers""","""['Interchangeability of measurements of total and free prostate-specific antigen in serum with 5 frequently used assay combinations: an update.', 'Variability of assay methods for total and free PSA after WHO standardization.', 'Comparison of 6 automated assays for total and free prostate-specific antigen with special reference to their reactivity toward the WHO 96/670 reference preparation.', 'Discordant total and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assays: does calibration with WHO reference materials diminish the problem?', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.']"""

Radiomics have not been explored depth in the context of predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PCa.  Purpose:   To identify a set of radiomic features derived from pretreatment biparametric MRI (bpMRI) that may be predictive of PCa BCR.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Subjects:   In all, 120 PCa patients from two institutions, I1 and I2 , partitioned into training set D1 (N = 70) from I1 and independent validation set D2 (N = 50) from I2 . All patients were followed for ≥3 years.  Sequence:   3T, T2 -weighted (T2 WI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps derived from diffusion-weighted sequences.  Assessment:   PCa regions of interest (ROIs) on T2 WI were annotated by two experienced radiologists. Radiomic features from bpMRI (T2 WI and ADC maps) were extracted from the ROIs. A machine-learning classifier (CBCR ) was trained with the best discriminating set of radiomic features to predict BCR (pBCR ).  Statistical tests:   Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Differences in BCR-free survival at 3 years using pBCR was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with Gleason Score (GS), PSA, and PIRADS-v2.  Results:   Distribution statistics of co-occurrence of local anisotropic gradient orientation (CoLlAGe) and Haralick features from T2 WI and ADC were associated with BCR (P < 0.05) on D1 . CBCR predictions resulted in a mean AUC = 0.84 on D1 and AUC = 0.73 on D2 . A significant difference in BCR-free survival between the predicted classes (BCR + and BCR-) was observed (P = 0.02) on D2 compared to those obtained from GS (P = 0.8), PSA (P = 0.93) and PIRADS-v2 (P = 0.23).  Data conclusion:   Radiomic features from pretreatment bpMRI can be predictive of PCa BCR after therapy and may help identify men who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.

Recently low cancer detection rates were reported for PI-RADS version 2 category 4 lesions. Therefore the aim of the study was to evaluate the cancer detection rate of PI-RADS version 2 in a large prospective cohort.  Materials and methods:   The study included 704 consecutive men with primary or prior negative biopsies who underwent magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion guided targeted biopsy and 10-core systematic prostate biopsy between September 2015 and May 2017.

Moreover, a general consensus is lacking on the number of biopsy cores to be obtained from a single magnetic resonance imaging lesion. Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility of obtaining only 1 biopsy core per magnetic resonance imaging lesion.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated a total of 2,128 biopsy cores of 1,064 prostatic lesions (2 cores per lesion) in 418 patients in regard to prostate cancer detection (histology) and the Gleason score of the first biopsy core compared to the second biopsy core. Two analyses were performed, including patient level analysis based on prostate cancer detection per patient and lesion level analysis based exclusively on the histology of each lesion regardless of the overall histological outcome of the case.  Results:   The overall prostate cancer detection rate was 45.7% (191 of 418 patients). The first biopsy core detected 170 of all 191 prostate cancers (89%). In 17 of these 170 prostate cancers (10%) the second biopsy core revealed Gleason score upgrading. Nine of the 21 prostate cancers (43%) missed by the first biopsy core had a Gleason score of 6. Altogether 537 of the 2,128 biopsy cores were positive, including 283 first (26.6%) and 254 second (24%) biopsy cores (p ≤0.001).

Safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of birabresib were evaluated in patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer, nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma (NMC), and non-small-cell lung cancer in this phase Ib study.  Patients and methods:   Forty-seven patients were enrolled to receive birabresib once daily at starting doses of 80 mg continuously (cohort A) or 100 mg for 7 consecutive days (cohort B) in 21-day cycles using a parallel dose escalation 3 + 3 design. The primary objective was occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and determination of the recommended phase II dose.  Results:   Of 46 treated patients, 26 had castrate-resistant prostate cancer, 10 NMC, and 10 non-small-cell lung cancer. For cohort A, four of 19 (21%) evaluable patients had DLTs at 80 mg once daily (grade 3 thrombocytopenia [n = 3], ALT/hyperbilirubinemia [n = 1]) and two of three had DLTs at 100 mg once daily (grade 2 anorexia and nausea with treatment delay > 7 days [n = 1], grade 4 thrombocytopenia [n = 1]). No DLTs occurred in cohort B. Of 46 patients, 38 (83%) had treatment-related adverse events (diarrhea, 17 [37%]; nausea, 17 [37%]; anorexia, 14 [30%]; vomiting, 12 [26%]; thrombocytopenia 10 [22%]). Three patients with NMC (80 mg once daily) had a partial response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) with duration of 1.4 to 8.4 months. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated a dose-proportional increase in birabresib exposure and rapid absorption.  Conclusion:   The recommended phase II dose of birabresib in patients with select solid tumors is 80 mg once daily with continuous dosing.

Materials and methods:   In this retrospective study, 100 patients (median age, 62 years; range, 44-75 years; prostate-specific antigen level, 7.18 ng/mL; range, 1.70-84.56 ng/mL) underwent 3-T multiparametric MRI of the prostate with an endorectal coil. Mean ADC was extracted from ROIs based on subsequent prostatectomy specimens. Histopathologic analysis revealed 172 lesions (113 peripheral, 59 transition zone). Two radiologists blinded to histopathologic outcome assigned PI-RADSv2 categories. Kendall tau was used to correlate ADC metrics with PI-RADSv2 and ISUP categories. ROC curves were used to assess the utility of ADC metrics in differentiating each reader's PI-RADSv2 DWI category 4 or 5 assessment in the whole prostate and by zone.  Results:   ADC metrics negatively correlated with ISUP category in the whole prostate (ADC, τ = -0.21, p = 0.0002; normalized ADC, τ = -0.21, p = 0.0001). Moderate negative correlation was found in expert PI-RADSv2 DWI categories (ADC, τ = -0.34; normalized ADC, τ = -0.31; each p < 0.0001) maintained across zones. In the whole prostate, AUCs of ADC and normalized ADC were 87% and 82% for predicting expert PI-RADSv2 DWI category 4 or 5. A derived optimal cutoff ADC less than 1061 and normalized ADC less than 0.65 achieved positive predictive values of 83% and 84% for correct classification of PI-RADSv2 DWI category 4 or 5 by an expert reader.

However, its role remains unclear in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In our study, we investigated the expression of FABP4 at both mRNA and protein levels, and by examining 175 cases of patients with cancer of the liver tissue microarray, the significance between the expression of FABP4 and clinical characteristics had been discussed. We found that FABP4 was lowly expressed in HCC tissues compared to the corresponding tissue adjacent, and the expression of FABP4 was significantly associated with the tumor size, PVTT, recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the expression of FABP4, Alb, AFP, HBsAg, and PVTT were independent risk factors for overall survival, and the expression of FABP4, AFP, GGT, tumor size, and encapsulation were independent risk factors for HCC recurrence. In addition, we revealed that FABP4 suppressed HCC cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of FABP4 led to inhibit tumor growth and decreased tumor volume in vivo. These phenotypes were associated with altered expression of Snail and p-STAT3. Our studies thus suggest that FABP4 could be a potential target for HCC chemotherapy.""","""['Cheng-Qian Zhong', 'Xiu-Ping Zhang', 'Ning Ma', 'Er-Bin Zhang', 'Jing-Jing Li', 'Ya-Bo Jiang', 'Yu-Zhen Gao', 'Yan-Mei Yuan', 'Shi-Qian Lan', 'Dong Xie', 'Shu-Qun Cheng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Down-regulation of the tumour suppressor κ-opioid receptor predicts poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.', 'H2.0-like homeobox 1 acts as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'A novel prognostic biomarker SPC24 up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Update on Hepatocellular Carcinoma: a Brief Review from Pathologist Standpoint.', 'The role of UXT in tumors and prospects for its application in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Immunological Roles of FABP4 in Pancancer: A Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Role of AMPK-SREBP Signaling in Regulating Fatty Acid Binding-4 (FABP4) Expression following Ethanol Metabolism.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the immune implication of FABP4 in colon adenocarcinoma.', 'Bioinformatics analysis reveals the potential target of rosiglitazone as an antiangiogenic agent for breast cancer therapy.', 'FABP4 in obesity-associated carcinogenesis: Novel insights into mechanisms and therapeutic implications.']"""

Moreover, we also assessed the in-vivo antitumor activity of lobaplatin using xenograft mouse model. Importantly, we further dissected the underlying molecular mechanism by examining the expression of AR and ERG, as well as their downstream targets. We found that lobaplatin arrested cell cycle progression in G2/M phase and trigged cell apoptosis. Lobaplatin also dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and migration in vitro.

It was demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of WDR5 were upregulated in HCC cancer tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Furthermore, the elevated WDR5 protein level was significantly associated with the histological grade (P=0.038), tumor size (P=0.023), tumor-node-metastasis stage (P=0.035) and reduced long-term survival time. Additionally, it was demonstrated through the shRNA-mediated knockdown of WDR5 in HCC cells in vitro that WDR5 expression promotes cell proliferation using an MTT assay.

Methods:   In this work, we reported a colorimetric method for clinical detection of PSA using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as the reporters. The method is based on ascorbic acid (AA)-induced in situ formation of AuNPs and Cu2+-catalyzed oxidation of AA. Specifically, HAuCl4 can be reduced into AuNPs by AA; Cu2+ ion can catalyze the oxidation of AA by O2 to inhibit the formation of AuNPs. In the presence of the PSA-specific peptide (DAHSSKLQLAPP)-modified gold-coated magnetic microbeads (MMBs; denoted as DAHSSKLQLAPP-MMBs), complexation of Cu2+ by the MMBs through the DAH-Cu2+ interaction depressed the catalyzed oxidation of AA and thus allowed for the formation of red AuNPs. However, once the peptide immobilized on the MMB surface was cleaved by PSA, the DAHSSKLQ segment would be released. The resultant LAPP fragment remaining on the MMB surface could not sequestrate Cu2+ to depress its catalytic activity toward AA oxidation. Consequently, no or less AuNPs were generated.  Results:   The linear range for PSA detection was found to be 0~0.8 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.02 ng/mL. Because of the separation of cleavage step and measurement step, the interference of matrix components in biological samples was avoided.  Conclusion:   The high extinction coefficient of AuNPs facilitates the colorimetric analysis of PSA in serum samples.

When medical therapy fails, the 3-piece inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) can offer patients a definitive treatment option. Because of radiation-induced vascular changes and tissue fibrosis, a careful surgical approach is necessary to avoid intraoperative complications and attain successful outcomes. Despite its widespread use in prostate cancer treatment, there are no contemporary studies examining the effects that pelvic radiation can have on 3-piece IPP placement and device survival.  Aim:   To present technical considerations and contemporary outcomes of placing a 3-piece IPP for refractory erectile dysfunction in patients with a history of pelvic radiation.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 78 patients who underwent placement of a 3-piece IPP (AMS 700; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) after being treated with pelvic radiotherapy from 2003 through 2016. All patients had been treated with external beam and/or brachytherapy for treatment of prostate malignancy. An infrapubic approach was used in all patients, with reservoir placement in the space of Retzius or in the lateral retroperitoneal space. Patient demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative outcomes including prosthetic infection and mechanical failure were examined and statistical analysis was performed.  Outcomes:   Rates of device infection, revision surgery, and reservoir complications.  Results:   No intraoperative complications were observed. After a mean follow-up of 49.0 months (6.6-116.8), 2 patients developed an infection of their prosthesis that required explantation. These patients underwent successful IPP removal and immediate reimplantation. 11 patients (14.1%) required revision surgery (pump replacement, n = 4; pump relocation, n = 2; cylinder replacement, n = 4; reservoir replacement owing to leak, n = 1). No reservoir-related complications such as herniation or erosion into adjacent structures were observed.  Clinical implications:   The 3-piece IPP can be placed safely in a broad range of patients treated with pelvic radiotherapy.  Strengths and limitations:   This study describes contemporary long-term outcomes of the IPP in patients treated with pelvic radiation and includes patients with prior pelvic surgery and artificial urinary sphincter, which are commonly encountered in practice. It is limited by its single-center experience and lacks a comparison group of patients. Objective patient satisfaction data were not available for inclusion.  Conclusions:   The 3-piece IPP can be placed successfully in patients with a history of pelvic radiation without a significant increase in infectious complications, reservoir erosion, or mechanical failure compared with the global literature.

For the first time, we investigated the prospective associations between this pro plant-based dietary score and cancer risk.

Materials and methods:   In this bicentric study, we prospectively enrolled 80 PCa patients who underwent pre-EBRT mpMRI on a 3.0T magnet with a multiparametric protocol including high-resolution, multiplanar T2-weighted sequences, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging.

The DA was provided to patients at, or soon after diagnosis. Decisional conflict, involvement, knowledge, and satisfaction with information were assessed with a questionnaire after treatment decision-making. Anxiety and depression served as covariates.  Results:   The levels of decision involvement and conflict were comparable between patients in both groups. Patients with a DA felt more knowledgeable but scored equally well on a knowledge test as patients without a DA. Small significant negative effects were found on satisfaction with information and preparation for decision-making. A preference for print over online and depression and anxiety symptoms was negatively associated with satisfaction and conflict scores in the DA group.  Discussion:   The DA aimed to support shared decision-making, while outcomes for a majority of DA users were comparable to patients who received standard counseling.

Materials:   Three hundred and fifty-eight lesions that may be changed from category 4 to 5 or vice versa on the basis of the size criterion (category 4: n = 288, category 5: n = 70) from 255 patients were evaluated. Kendall's tau-b statistic accounting for inter-lesion correlation, generalized estimation equation logistic regression, and receiver operating curve analysis evaluated two lesion size-metrics (lesion diameter and relative lesion diameter-defined as lesion diameter/prostate volume) for ability to identify CS (Gleason grade ≥ 3 + 4) cancer at targeted biopsy. Optimal cut-points were identified using the Youden index. Analyses were performed for the whole prostate (WP) and zone-specific sub-cohorts of lesions in the peripheral and transition zones (PZ and TZ).  Results:   Lesion diameter showed a modest correlation with Gleason grade (WP: τB = 0.21, p < 0.0001; PZ: τB = 0.13, p = 0.02; TZ: τB = 0.32, p = 0.001), and association with CS cancer detection (WP: AUC = 0.63, PZ: AUC = 0.59, TZ: AUC = 0.74). Empirically derived thresholds (WP: 14 mm, PZ: 13 mm, TZ: 16 mm) performed similarly to the current ≥ 15 mm standard. Lesion relative lesion diameter improved identification of CS cancers compared to lesion diameter alone (WP: τB = 0.30, PZ: τB = 0.24, TZ: τB = 0.42, all p < 0.0001). AUC also improved for WP and PZ lesions (WP: AUC = 0.70, PZ: AUC = 0.68, and TZ: AUC = 0.74).  Conclusions:   The current ≥ 15 mm diameter threshold is a reasonable delineator of PI-RADS category 4 and category 5 lesions in the absence of extraprostatic extension to predict CS cancers.

In the present study, taxane-resistant cancer cells were established and stem-like cancer cells were expanded. UHRF1 was overexpressed in the taxane-resistant cancer cells, which maintained CSC characteristics. UHRF1 depletion overcame taxane resistance in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, FOXM1 has been reported to play a role in therapeutic resistance and the self-renewal of CSCs. FOXM1 and UHRF1 are highly correlated in prostate cancer tissues and cells, FOXM1 regulates CSCs by regulating uhrf1 gene transcription in an E2F-independent manner, and FOXM1 protein directly binds to the FKH motifs at the uhrf1 gene promoter.

Lutetium-177 [177Lu]-PSMA-617, a radiolabelled small molecule, binds with high affinity to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) enabling beta particle therapy targeted to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We aimed to investigate the safety, efficacy, and effect on quality of life of [177Lu]-PSMA-617 in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who progressed after standard treatments.  Methods:   In this single-arm, single-centre, phase 2 trial, we recruited men (aged 18 years and older) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and progressive disease after standard treatments, including taxane-based chemotherapy and second-generation anti-androgens, from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. Patients underwent a screening PSMA and FDG-PET/CT to confirm high PSMA-expression. Eligible patients had progressive disease defined by imaging (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours [RECIST] or bone scan) or new pain in an area of radiographically evident disease, and were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 2 or lower. Eligible patients received up to four cycles of intravenous [177Lu]-PSMA-617, at six weekly intervals. The primary endpoint was PSA response according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial Working Group criteria defined as a greater than 50% PSA decline from baseline and toxicity according to CTCAE. Additional primary endpoints were imaging responses (as measured by bone scan, CT, PSMA, and FDG PET/CT) and quality of life (assessed with the EORTC-Q30 and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form questionnaires), all measured up to 3 months post completion of treatment. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number 12615000912583.  Findings:   Between Aug 26, 2015, and Dec 8, 2016, 43 men were screened to identify 30 patients eligible for treatment. 26 (87%) had received at least one line of previous chemotherapy (80% docetaxel and 47% cabazitaxel) and 25 (83%) received prior abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or both. The mean administered radioactivity was 7·5 GBq per cycle. 17 (57%) of 30 patients (95% CI 37-75) achieved a PSA decline of 50% or more. There were no treatment-related deaths. The most common toxic effects related to [177Lu]-PSMA-617 were grade 1 dry mouth recorded in 26 (87%) patients, grade 1 and 2 transient nausea in 15 (50%), and G1-2 fatigue in 15 (50%). Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia possibly attributed to [177Lu]-PSMA-617 occurred in four (13%) patients. Objective response in nodal or visceral disease was reported in 14 (82%) of 17 patients with measurable disease. Clinically meaningful improvements in pain severity and interference scores were recorded at all timepoints. 11 (37%) patients experienced a ten point or more improvement in global health score by the second cycle of treatment.  Interpretation:   Our findings show that radionuclide treatment with [177Lu]-PSMA-617 has high response rates, low toxic effects, and reduction of pain in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have progressed after conventional treatments. This evidence supports the need for randomised controlled trials to further assess efficacy compared with current standards of care.

In prostate cancer, a history of falls (OR = 3.04, 95%CI = 1.79-5.15), unmarried (OR = 1.82, 95%CI = 1.12-2.95), lower physical summary score of quality-of-life(OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.94-0.98), urinary incontinence (OR = 1.69, 95%CI = 1.08-2.65), older age at diagnosis (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.01-1.09), and shorter time post-diagnosis (OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 0.93-0.99) were significant predictors of falls. AUC was 0.67 and 0.77 for breast and prostate cancer, respectively, indicating moderate accuracy of models in detecting fallers.  Conclusions:   Asking older breast and prostate cancer survivors about falls in the past 12 months is imperative in fall prevention. Further examination of deficits specific to each cancer is necessary to assess fall risks.""","""['Min H Huang', 'Jennifer Blackwood', 'Monica Godoshian', 'Lucinda Pfalzer']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Geriatr Oncol""","""['Factors associated with self-reported falls, balance or walking difficulty in older survivors of breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer: Results from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey linkage.', 'Prevalence of self-reported falls, balance or walking problems in older cancer survivors from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey.', 'Association of falls with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older cancer survivors: A population based study.', 'Home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes for breast cancer survivors.', 'Accidental Fall Rates in Community-Dwelling Adults Compared to Cancer Survivors During and Post-Treatment: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis.', 'Accumulated incidence of falls in people hospitalised with cancer and related factors.', 'Risk factors for falls in hospitalized patients with cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Challenges of Survivorship for Older Adults Diagnosed with Cancer.', 'The impact of urinary incontinence on falls: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Assessment of Gait Speed and Timed Up and Go Measures as Predictors of Falls in Older Breast Cancer Survivors.']"""

Assaying enzyme activity is difficult due to the reversibility of the 'racemisation' reaction and the difficulties in the separation of epimeric products; consequently few inhibitors have been described and no structure-activity relationship study has been performed. This paper describes the first structure-activity relationship study, in which a series of 23 known and potential rational AMACR inhibitors were evaluated. AMACR was potently inhibited (IC50 = 400-750 nM) by ibuprofenoyl-CoA and derivatives. Potency was positively correlated with inhibitor lipophilicity. AMACR was also inhibited by straight-chain and branched-chain acyl-CoA esters, with potency positively correlating with inhibitor lipophilicity. 2-Methyldecanoyl-CoAs were ca. 3-fold more potent inhibitors than decanoyl-CoA, demonstrating the importance of the 2-methyl group for effective inhibition. Elimination substrates and compounds with modified acyl-CoA cores were also investigated, and shown to be potent inhibitors. These results are the first to demonstrate structure-activity relationships of rational AMACR inhibitors and that potency can be predicted by acyl-CoA lipophilicity. The study also demonstrates the utility of the colorimetric assay for thorough inhibitor characterisation.""","""['Maksims Yevglevskis', 'Guat L Lee', 'Amit Nathubhai', 'Yoana D Petrova', 'Tony D James', 'Michael D Threadgill', 'Timothy J Woodman', 'Matthew D Lloyd']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Bioorg Chem""","""['A study on the AMACR catalysed elimination reaction and its application to inhibitor testing.', 'Novel 2-arylthiopropanoyl-CoA inhibitors of α-methylacyl-CoA racemase 1A (AMACR; P504S) as potential anti-prostate cancer agents.', 'Identification of novel small-molecule inhibitors of α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR; P504S) and structure-activity relationships.', 'α-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR): metabolic enzyme, drug metabolizer and cancer marker P504S.', 'Discovery and clinical application of a novel prostate cancer marker: alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S).', 'Racemases and epimerases operating through a 1,1-proton transfer mechanism: reactivity, mechanism and inhibition.', 'Current Knowledge on the Function of α-Methyl Acyl-CoA Racemase in Human Diseases.']"""

Methods:   AIRC-IG-13218 is a prospective Phase II trial started in June 2015. Patients with low and intermediate risk PCa who met the inclusion criteria underwent extreme hypofractionated radiotherapy to the prostate (36.25 Gy in 5 fractions) and a simultaneous integrated boost to the dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL) to 37.5 Gy. The DIL was identified by a multiparamentric MRI (mpMRI) co-registered with planning CT. Toxicity was assessed according to CTCAE v4.0 and RTOG/EORTC criteria. The preliminary evaluation of the first 13 patients was required to confirm the feasibility of the treatment before completing the enrollment of 65 patients.  Results:   The first 13 patients completed the treatment between June 2015 and February 2016. With a median clinical follow-up of 17 months (range 11-26), no Grade 3 or 4 early toxicity was reported.  Conclusions:   Our preliminary data about early toxicity of an extreme hypofractionated schedule with concomitant boost on the DIL are encouraging. The higher number of patients expected for the trial and a longer follow-up are needed to confirm these results. Advances in knowledge: The use of mpMRI to identify and boost the DIL is an innovative and interesting approach to PCa.

Subjects and methods:   Cross-sectional associations between LM and FM with fatigue and/or vitality measures were examined in 229 patients (aged 43-90 years). Prospective analysis was undertaken in 129 patients who underwent a supervised 3-6 months exercise programme (predominantly resistance + aerobic). Whole body and appendicular LM, and total and trunk FM were assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry. Fatigue was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-30) and vitality using the Short Form-36.  Results:   Based on the EORTC QLQ-30, 19% of patients had clinically relevant fatigue. There was no association between LM and fatigue; however, total (P = 0.013), trunk (P = 0.015) and percentage (P = 0.008) FM were higher in fatigued than not fatigued patients, with total and trunk FM 5.0 and 2.6 kg higher, respectively. For quartiles of vitality, a similar pattern emerged for FM with those in the lowest quartile of vitality having the highest FM values (P = 0.014-0.034). In contrast, following supervised exercise, change in fatigue and vitality were associated with change in total LM (r = -0.182, P = 0.042 and r = 0.309, P = 0.001, respectively) but not FM. Patients fatigued at baseline but not fatigued following the exercise programme gained a median (interquartile range) of 2.1 (0.7-3.2) kg LM.  Conclusion:   In patients with prostate cancer treated with ADT, body composition is associated with fatigue, with higher total and trunk FM in those with clinically relevant fatigue. However, following exercise those no longer fatigued had an accompanying substantial increase in LM. Modifying body composition, both LM and FM, in patients with prostate cancer may favourably alter cancer-related fatigue levels and should be a target of exercise medicine in this population.""","""['Robert U Newton', 'Emily Jeffery', 'Daniel A Galvão', 'Carolyn J Peddle-McIntyre', 'Nigel Spry', 'David Joseph', 'James W Denham', 'Dennis R Taaffe']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Immediate versus delayed exercise in men initiating androgen deprivation: effects on bone density and soft tissue composition.', 'Effects of Different Exercise Modalities on Fatigue in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy: A Year-long Randomised Controlled Trial.', 'Can supervised exercise prevent treatment toxicity in patients with prostate cancer initiating androgen-deprivation therapy: a randomised controlled trial.', 'Effects of exercise on treatment-related adverse effects for patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: a systematic review.', 'Using Exercise and Nutrition to Alter Fat and Lean Mass in Men with Prostate Cancer Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy: A Narrative Review.', 'The impact of high intensity interval training in a diverse group of cancer survivors: CAPABLE, a pilot study.', 'Fatigue and associated factors among adult cancer patients receiving cancer treatment at oncology unit in Amhara region, Ethiopia.', 'The Impact of Exercise on Improving Body Composition and PSA in High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients on Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Fasting and Exercise in Oncology: Potential Synergism of Combined Interventions.', 'Associations of Physical Activity and Exercise with Health-related Outcomes in Patients with Melanoma During and After Treatment: A Systematic Review.']"""

Fibroblast growth factor/receptor (FGF/FGFR) signaling is also involved in tumor progression and EMT in multiple tissues. Several studies have investigated the role of βKlotho, an FGF/FGFR signaling co‑receptor in tumorigenesis. However, its role in PCa remains unknown. In the present study, the role of androgen in the EMT of PCa cells was examined by western blotting. The expression of βKlotho was examined in prostate cells and PCa tissues by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The biological role of βKlotho was revealed by a series of functional in vitro and in vivo studies. We determined that βKlotho expression was significantly decreased in PCa tissues compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, and low βKlotho expression was associated with a high Gleason score of PCa. βKlotho overexpression inhibited the viability, migration, and androgen/AR‑associated EMT of PCa cells through the inactivation of ERK1/2 signaling. Notably, βKlotho overexpression inhibited prostate tumor growth and EMT in vivo. Knockdown of βKlotho produced the opposite effects.

To study the molecular mechanism of PCGEM1 function in hormone‑refractory prostate cancer, the interaction between myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and PCGEM1 was assessed by a luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. In addition, the underlying mechanism of PCGEM1 regulating expression of microRNA (miR)‑148a in PC3 prostate cancer cells was evaluated. Relative expression levels were measured by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and early apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. PCGEM1 was demonstrated to be overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues compared with noncancerous tissues. Expression levels of PCGEM1 in PC3 cancer cells were demonstrated to be regulated by MEF2, as PCGME1 mRNA was increased by MEF2 overexpression but decreased by MEF2 silencing. MEF2 was also demonstrated to enhance the activity of PCGEM1 promoter and thus promote PCGEM1 transcription. In addition, downregulation of PCGEM1 expression in PC3 cells increased expression of miR‑148a. By contrast, overexpression of PCGEM1 decreased miR‑148a expression. Finally, PCGME1 silencing by small interfering RNA significantly induced early cell apoptosis but this effect was reduced by a miR‑148a inhibitor. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a positive regulatory association between MEF2 and PCGEM1, and a reciprocal negative regulatory association between PCGEM1 and miR‑148a that controls cell apoptosis.

Cell proliferation, colony formation, and Transwell assays were performed to determine the effects of exogenous, autocrine, and paracrine CXCL5 on prostate cancer cell proliferative and migratory capacity. The results indicated that CXCL5 expression was upregulated in PC‑3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, in WPMY‑1 normal prostate stromal cells, and in RWPE‑1 prostate epithelial cells, as well as in prostate cancer tissue specimens. Exogenous CXCL5 exposure resulted in increase in prostate cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration.

While docetaxel is the most commonly prescribed Taxane for mCRPC; cabazitaxel has been approved for patients unresponsive to docetaxel. Still mCRPC remains incurable and patients often experience severe side effects. Recently, the FIRSTANA trial first demonstrated the absence of superiority in overall survival between cabazitaxel and docetaxel in mCRPC patients. Inversely, different toxicity were reported suggesting that cabazitaxel may provide a first line treatment option for some patients urging for a deeper characterization of cabazitaxel mechanisms of action as well as a re-evaluation of cabazitaxel conventional dose and schedule. In this study, our goal was therefore to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of various cabazitaxel regimens delivered as monotherapy or in combination with PEDF, a known anti-angiogenic and anti-neoplastic agent.  Methods:   CRPC cells undergoing Taxane treatment were evaluated for cell proliferation, migration and death, and apoptosis using crystal violet staining, chemotaxis, cell cycle, and TUNEL assays. In vitro data were corroborated in CL1 CRPC xenografts where mice received intermittent or metronomic low-doses cabazitaxel ± PEDF.  Results:   We found that cabazitaxel inhibits the proliferation of CRPC cells with a higher efficacy than docetaxel in vitro. As expected, high-doses of Taxanes blocked the cells in mitosis. Surprisingly, low-doses of cabazitaxel induced more cell death than docetaxel mainly through apoptosis. In vivo, intermittent cabazitaxel lead to disease stabilization when combined with PEDF. Unexpectedly, low-doses of cabazitaxel delayed tumor growth with severe toxicity for some of the doses tested. Other results showed that PEDF and low-doses of cabazitaxel combination inhibited the migration of tumor cell and increased the tumoricidal activity of macrophages toward prostate tumor cells.  Conclusions:   Our findings highlight the great promise of cabazitaxel drug and predict a possible move of cabazitaxel forward within the therapeutic sequence of prostate cancer.""","""['Courtney Jarvis', 'Thomas Nelius', 'Dalia Martinez-Marin', 'Souad R Sennoune', 'Stéphanie Filleur']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Pigment epithelium-derived factor expression prolongs survival and enhances the cytotoxicity of low-dose chemotherapy in castration-refractory prostate cancer.', 'PEDF increases the tumoricidal activity of macrophages towards prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Cabazitaxel-conjugated nanoparticles for docetaxel-resistant and bone metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical profile of cabazitaxel.', 'Cabazitaxel: a novel second-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Crosstalk between Microtubule Stabilizing Agents and Prostate Cancer.', 'Cabazitaxel suppresses the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis and radiosensitivity of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor and Sex Hormone-Responsive Cancers.', 'Preparation and Evaluation of Cabazitaxel-Loaded Bovine Serum Albumin Nanoparticles for Prostate Cancer.', 'The Wnt non-canonical signaling modulates cabazitaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer cells.']"""

Results:   GHRH-R antagonists decreased cell viability and provoked a reduction in proliferation in LNCaP and PC3 cells. Moreover, GHRH-R antagonists caused a time-dependent increase of cell adhesion in all three cell lines and retarded the wound closure with the highest value with MIA-690 in PC3 cells. GHRH-R antagonists also provoked a large number of cells in SubG0 phase revealing an increase in apoptotic cells in PC3 cell line.

Circulating miRNAs are stable and detectable in cell-free body fluids, such as serum. Investigation of circulating miRNAs presents great potential in uncovering new insights into the roles of miRNAs in PCa diagnosis and therapy.  Methods:   Using TaqMan miRNA quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we compared the expression levels of five miRNAs (miR-193a-3p, miR-9-3p, miR-335-5p, miR-330-3p, and miR-345-5p) in serum samples from 20 normal individuals without cancer, 25 patients with localized disease, 25 patients with hormone-naïve or hormone sensitive metastatic disease, and 25 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). These five miRNAs were identified as potential oncogenes in our previous studies. MiR-345-5p was further investigated for its functional roles in CRPC cells.  Results:   We discovered that miR-9-3p, miR-330-3p-3p, and miR-345-5p were significantly overexpressed in serum from PCa patients when compared to serum from individuals without cancer. No differential expression patterns were observed between different disease categories. However, patients who were in remission after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) appeared to have significantly lower miR-345-5p levels compared to the rest of the groups. We further demonstrated that miR-345-5p promotes CRPC cell growth and migration in vitro and validated that CDKN1A (the gene encoding p21) is the direct target of miR-345-5p.  Conclusions:   Our results set the stage for a further investigation on the potential application of circulating miR-345-5p as a biomarker for PCa diagnosis and therapeutic response.

Often, PCa progresses from androgen-sensitive to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) following androgen-deprivation therapy. Clinicopathologic and genomic characterizations of CRPC tumors lead to subdividing CRPC into two subtypes: (1) AR-dependent CRPC containing dysregulation of AR signaling alterations in AR such as amplification, point mutations, and/or generation of splice variants in the AR gene; and (2) an aggressive variant PCa (AVPC) subtype that is phenotypically similar to small cell prostate cancer and is defined by chemotherapy sensitivity, gain of neuroendocrine or pro-neural marker expression, loss of AR expression, and combined alterations of PTEN, TP53, and RB1 tumor suppressors. Previously, we reported patient-derived xenograft (PDX) animal models that contain characteristics of these CRPC subtypes. In this study, we have employed the PDX models to test metabolic alterations in the CRPC subtypes.  Procedures:   Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis along with in vivo hyperpolarized 1-[13C]pyruvate spectroscopy experiments were performed on prostate PDX animal models.  Results:   Using hyperpolarized 1-[13C]pyruvate conversion to 1-[13C]lactate in vivo as well as lactate measurements ex vivo, we have found increased lactate production in AR-dependent CRPC PDX models even under low-hormone levels (castrated mouse) compared to AR-negative AVPC PDX models.

Analysis of the TCGA data revealed that eIF4G1 gene expression positively correlated with higher tumor grade and stage. Furthermore, eIF4G1 was over-expressed and or amplified, in 16% patients with metastatic PCa (SU2C/PCF Dream Team dataset) and in 59% of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients (Trento/Cornell/Broad dataset). We showed for the first time that eIF4G1 expression was increased in PCa and that increased eIF4G1 expression associated with tumor progression and metastasis. We also observed high protein levels of eIF4G1 in PCa cell lines and prostate tissues from the TRAMP model of PCa as compared to normal prostate cell line and prostate tissues from the wild type mice. Knockdown of eIF4G1 in PCa cells resulted in decreased Cyclin D1 and p-Rb protein level, cell cycle delay, reduced cell viability and proliferation, impaired clonogenic activity, reduced cell migration and decreased mRNA loading to polysomes. Treatment with eIF4G complex inhibitor also impaired prostasphere formation. eIF4G1 knockdown or treatment with eIF4G complex inhibitor sensitized CRPC cells to Enzalutamide and Bicalutamide.

Methods: A recently developed PBPK model for 177Lu-PSMA I&T RLT was extended to account for tumor (exponential) growth and reduction due to irradiation (linear quadratic model). Data from 13 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters were simultaneously fitted in a Bayesian framework to PET/CT activity concentrations, planar scintigraphy data, and tumor volumes before and after (6 wk) therapy. The method was validated using the leave-one-out Jackknife method. The tumor volume after therapy was predicted on the basis of pretherapy PET/CT imaging and PBPK/PD modeling. Results: The relative deviation of the predicted and measured tumor volume for PSMA-positive tumor cells (6 wk after therapy) was 1% ± 40%, excluding 1 patient (prostate-specific antigen-negative) from the population. The radiosensitivity for the prostate-specific antigen-positive patients was determined to be 0.0172 ± 0.0084 Gy-1Conclusion: To our knowledge, the proposed method is the first attempt to solely use PET/CT and modeling methods to predict the PSMA-positive tumor volume after RLT.

Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) recapitulate the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the disease. We sought to establish a representative, preclinical platform of PDX-derived organoids that is experimentally facile for high-throughput and mechanistic analysis.Experimental Design: Using 20 models from the LuCaP mCRPC PDX cohort, including adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine lineages, we systematically tested >20 modifications to prostate organoid conditions. Organoids were evaluated for genomic and phenotypic stability and continued reliance on the AR signaling pathway. The utility of the platform as a genotype-dependent model of drug sensitivity was tested with olaparib and carboplatin.Results: All PDX models proliferated as organoids in culture. Greater than 50% could be continuously cultured long-term in modified conditions; however, none of the PDXs could be established long-term as organoids under previously reported conditions. In addition, the modified conditions improved the establishment of patient biopsies over current methods. The genomic heterogeneity of the PDXs was conserved in organoids.

Results:   There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of any of the functioning sub-scales and symptoms, except significantly lower social functioning observed in BC survivors than that observed in KC survivors. Although the three groups of UC survivors showed essentially similar functioning sub-scales and symptoms when compared to the general population, PC and BC survivors showed significantly lower social functioning and a lower appetite than that observed in controls. KC survivors showed lower physical functioning, as well as higher pain and dyspnea. Although all three groups of UC survivors reported higher financial difficulties, they also reported higher perceived social support than that reported by the non-cancer control group.

Despite the success of peptides labeled with gallium-68 (for imaging) or lutetium-177 (for therapy) in the clinical management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors or prostate cancer, there are significant advantages of using fluorine-18 for imaging. Recent developments have greatly simplified such labeling: in particular, labeling of organotrifluoroborates via isotopic exchange can readily be performed in a single-step under aqueous conditions and without the need for HPLC purification. Though an automated synthesis has not yet been explored, microfluidic approaches have emerged for 18F-labeling with high speed, minimal reagents, and high molar activity compared to conventional approaches. As a proof-of-concept, we performed microfluidic labeling of an octreotate analog ([18F]AMBF3-TATE), a promising 18F-labeled analog that could compete with [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE with the advantage of providing a greater number of patient doses per batch produced.  Methods:   Both [18F]AMBF3-TATE and [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE were labeled, the former by microscale methods adapted from manual labeling, and were imaged in mice bearing human SSTR2-overexpressing, rat SSTR2 wildtype, and SSTR2-negative xenografts. Furthermore, a dosimetry analysis was performed for [18F]AMBF3-TATE.  Results:   The micro-synthesis exhibited highly-repeatable performance with radiochemical conversion of 50 ± 6% (n = 15), overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 16 ± 1% (n = 5) in ~40 min, radiochemical purity >99%, and high molar activity. Preclinical imaging with [18F]AMBF3-TATE in SSTR2 tumor models correlated well with [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE. The favorable biodistribution, with the highest tracer accumulation in the bladder followed distantly by gastrointestinal tissues, resulted in 1.26 × 10-2 mSv/MBq maximal estimated effective dose in human, a value lower than that reported for current clinical 18F- and 68Ga-labeled compounds.  Conclusions:   The combination of novel chemical approaches to 18F-labeling and microdroplet radiochemistry have the potential to serve as a platform for greatly simplified development and production of 18F-labeled peptide tracers. Favorable preclinical imaging and dosimetry of [18F]AMBF3-TATE, combined with a convenient synthesis, validate this assertion and suggest strong potential for clinical translation.""","""['Ksenia Lisova', 'Maxim Sergeev', 'Susan Evans-Axelsson', 'Andreea D Stuparu', 'Seval Beykan', 'Jeffrey Collins', 'Jason Jones', 'Michael Lassmann', 'Ken Herrmann', 'David Perrin', 'Jason T Lee', 'Roger Slavik', 'R Michael van Dam']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Preclinical evaluation of a high-affinity 18F-trifluoroborate octreotate derivative for somatostatin receptor imaging.', 'In Vivo Evaluation of ¹⁸F-SiFAlin-Modified TATE: A Potential Challenge for ⁶⁸Ga-DOTATATE, the Clinical Gold Standard for Somatostatin Receptor Imaging with PET.', 'Radiosynthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of 18F-Fluoroglycosylated Octreotate for Somatostatin Receptor Imaging.', 'The Search for an Alternative to 68GaGa-DOTA-TATE in Neuroendocrine Tumor Theranostics: Current State of 18F-labeled Somatostatin Analog Development.', '18F-Labeled Somatostatin Analogs as PET Tracers for the Somatostatin Receptor: Ready for Clinical Use.', 'Preparation and Evaluation of 18FAlF-NOTA-NOC for PET Imaging of Neuroendocrine Tumors: Comparison to 68GaGa-DOTA/NOTA-NOC.', 'Microliter-scale reaction arrays for economical high-throughput experimentation in radiochemistry.', 'Development of 18FAmBF3 Tetrazine for Radiolabeling of Peptides: Preclinical Evaluation and PET Imaging of 18FAmBF3-PEG7-Tyr3-Octreotide in an AR42J Pancreatic Carcinoma Model.', 'A novel multi-reaction microdroplet platform for rapid radiochemistry optimization.', 'Multi-GBq production of the radiotracer 18Ffallypride in a droplet microreactor.']"""

These substances accumulate in tumors but often remain too long in circulation. We investigated the combination of intravenous urokinase injection and its substrate linker as a triggered radioisotope clearance enhancement system to improve imaging contrast. To this end, we synthesized a four-arm PEGylated 64Cu-bombesin analog tetramer with a urokinase substrate linker. In mouse blood, it was almost perfectly cleaved and degraded into smaller radioactive fragments in vitro with urokinase (≥20,000 IU/mL). In mouse blood circulation, ∼50-65% of the probe was rapidly degraded after the urokinase injection and the radioactive fragments were eliminated mainly from the kidney. In contrast, tumor radioactivity levels did not change, and therefore, the tumors were clearly visualized. The tumor/blood ratio, an indicator of imaging contrast, increased 2.5 times, while elimination of the radioisotope from the blood was enhanced. This approach has the potential to improve imaging contrast using various PET probes. It could also shorten the time required to obtain sufficient contrast and decrease patient radiation exposure.""","""['Kazushi Matsumura', 'Maki Zouda', 'Yasuhiro Wada', 'Fumiyoshi Yamashita', 'Mitsuru Hashida', 'Yasuyoshi Watanabe', 'Hidefumi Mukai']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Pharm""","""['Improved Immuno-PET Imaging of HER2-Positive Tumors in Mice: Urokinase Injection-Triggered Clearance Enhancement of 64Cu-Trastuzumab.', 'Evaluation of a novel GRPR antagonist for prostate cancer PET imaging: 64Cu-DOTHA2-PEG-RM26.', 'Development of PEGylated peptide probes conjugated with (18)F-labeled BODIPY for PET/optical imaging of MT1-MMP activity.', 'Bombesin-Targeted PET of Prostate Cancer.', 'New issues for copper-64: from precursor to innovative PET tracers in clinical oncology.', 'Protease-triggered bioresponsive drug delivery for the targeted theranostics of malignancy.', 'ImmunoPET: Concept, Design, and Applications.']"""

Materials and methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional study of men aged above 40 years with no history of prostate cancer, prostate surgery, or 5α-reductase inhibitor treatment. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PV were measured in each subject. Potential sociodemographic and clinical variables including age, weight, comorbidities, and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) were collected. Of 1034 subjects, 837 were used in building the PV calculator using regression analysis. The remaining 1/5 (n = 197) was used for model validation.  Results:   There were 1034 multiethnic Asian men (Chinese 52.9%, Malay 35.4%, and Indian 11.7%) with mean age of 60 ± 7.6 years. Average PV was 29.4 ± 13.0 mL while the overall mean of PSA was 1.7 ± 1.7 ng/mL. We identified age, IPSS, weight, and PSA (all P <.05) in the PV regression model. Using the validation set, the coefficient of determination (R2) of this PV calculator was 0.47 where PV = 20.6 + (age - 60) × 0.1 + (IPSS score) × 0.1 + (Weight - 70) × 0.3 + (history of alpha-blocker treatment for LUTS) × 9.6 + PSA × 3.7. The area under curve of this model in predicting PV above 30 mL and 40 mL were 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.88) and 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.87-0.96), respectively.

Urinary continence was defined by 1 pad or less in 24 hours. Two multiple regression models were constructed to evaluate the association of time since open retropubic radical prostatectomy with the UCLA-PCI-UFI score and urinary continence.  Results:   The decrease in urinary continence rates between baseline and 15 years (99.6% vs 87.2%, p <0.001), and 2 and 15 years (95.3% vs 87.2%, p = 0.021) were statistically significant. Urinary continence rates were consistently higher in the younger group at all time points.  Conclusions:   A significant decrease in urinary continence rates was observed between baseline and 2 years, and between 2 and 15 years in the entire cohort. Urinary continence rates in age matched men in the general population who were followed longitudinally for 15 years were comparable to those in our study population.

MicroRNAs (miRs) have been identified to play important biological roles in a variety of tumors. Several studies showed that miR-191 was involved in the development of different cancers, but its role in prostate cancer remains unclear.  Methods:   Human PCa cell lines DU145, PC-3 and LNCAP, and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 were used. The expression level of miR-191 in 48 paired prostate tumor and adjacent normal tissues was assessed along with the clinical patient features. Synthetic miR-191 mimics and inhibitors were used to overexpress or inhibit the miR-191 level. CCK8 and colony formation assay were used to evaluate the cell growth. The ability of cell invasion was studied by transwell assay. Dual-luciferase experiment was used to identify the target gene and western blot was performed to evaluate the protein level.  Results:   miR-191 was overexpressed in PCa tissue samples compared to the normal group as well in PCa-derived cell lines. Upregulation miR-191 in PC-3 cells significantly promoted while downregulation miR-191 in DU145 cells retarded the cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, TIMP3 were proved to be a direct target gene of miR-191 and knockdown of TIMP3 reversed the function of miR-191 downregulation.

However, the association between nutritional circadian behaviours and cancer is not well understood. We investigated the longitudinal associations between number of eating episodes, night-time fasting duration, time of first and last eating episodes, as well as nutritional quality of last eating episode, respectively, with breast and prostate cancer risks, the two main cancer locations in women and men respectively. This prospective study included 41,389 day-working adults in the French NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-2016) who completed at least three 24 h dietary records during the first 2 years of follow-up.

However, no association was observed between cancer risk and number of eating episodes, night-time fasting duration, time of first eating episode or macronutrient composition of the last eating episode.

The smaller class included 9% of the study population in which men had a higher risk of prostate cancer and the risk was stronger associated with class membership than any of the covariates included in the study. Moreover, we found no association between T2DM and risk of prostate cancer after removal of the effect of informative censoring due to competing risks.

Materials and methods:   Among the 251 sRP performed during 2000-2016, 11 patients had failed multiple local therapies. We describe baseline clinical characteristics at primary cancer diagnosis and prior to sRP, surgical information, complications and oncological outcomes.  Results:   The mean±standard deviation age at sRP was 65±5 years and the median (interquartile range) serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 2 (1.3) ng/mL. The most common first and subsequent treatments were radiotherapy and cryotherapy, respectively, with median time of 24 months from the last local treatment. The median operative time was 180 minutes and median estimated blood loss was 750 mL. Five (45.5%) patients underwent additional procedures during sRP for pre-operative morbidity from prior treatments (rectourethral fistula, urethral stricture, incontinence). Post-operative complications requiring invasive intervention occurred in 7 (63.6%) patients. Over a median follow-up of 29 (12-96) months, 10 of the 11 men (90.9%) achieved an undetectable PSA in after sRP. Three of these men with an initially undetectable PSA level experienced biochemical recurrence; the remaining 7 are without evidence of disease. Overall, no local recurrence or systemic metastasis was identified at last follow-up.

There is currently a need of improved biomarkers, capable to distinguish mild versus aggressive forms of the disease, and thus guide therapeutic decisions. Although miRNAs deregulated in cancer represent exciting candidates as biomarkers, its scientific literature is frequently fragmented in dispersed studies. This problem is aggravated for miRNAs belonging to miRNA gene clusters with shared target genes. The miRNA cluster composed by hsa-mir-130b and hsa-mir-301b precursors was recently involved in prostate cancer pathogenesis, yet different studies assigned it opposite effects on the disease. We sought to elucidate the role of the human miR-130b/301b miRNA cluster in prostate cancer through a comprehensive data analysis of most published clinical cohorts. We interrogated methylomes, transcriptomes and patient clinical data, unifying previous reports and adding original analysis using the largest available cohort (TCGA-PRAD). We found that hsa-miR-130b-3p and hsa-miR-301b-3p are upregulated in neoplastic vs normal prostate tissue, as well as in metastatic vs primary sites. However, this increase in expression is not due to a decrease of the global DNA methylation of the genes in prostate tissues, as the promoter of the gene remains lowly methylated in normal and neoplastic tissue. A comparison of the levels of human miR-130b/301b and all the clinical variables reported for the major available cohorts, yielded positive correlations with malignance, specifically significant for T-stage, residual tumor status and primary therapy outcome. The assessment of the correlations between the hsa-miR-130b-3p and hsa-miR-301b-3p and candidate target genes in clinical samples, supports their repression of tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer. Altogether, these results favor an oncogenic role of miR-130b/301b cluster in prostate cancer.""","""['Rafael Sebastián Fort', 'Cecilia Mathó', 'Carolina Oliveira-Rizzo', 'Beatriz Garat', 'José Roberto Sotelo-Silveira', 'María Ana Duhagon']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Exp Hematol Oncol""","""['Downregulation of miR-130b~301b cluster is mediated by aberrant promoter methylation and impairs cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Deregulated microRNAs in triple-negative breast cancer revealed by deep sequencing.', 'miR-130b-3p/301b-3p negatively regulated Rb1cc1 expression on myogenic differentiation of chicken primary myoblasts.', 'miRNA Clusters with Up-Regulated Expression in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Clinical Role of Epigenetics and Network Analysis in Eye Diseases: A Translational Science Review.', 'Plasmatic MicroRNAs and Treatment Outcomes of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Hospital-Based Cohort Study and In Silico Analysis.', 'Development and validation of a genomic nomogram based on a ceRNA network for comprehensive analysis of obstructive sleep apnea.', 'Translational Research for Identifying Potential Early-stage Prostate Cancer Biomarkers.', 'Prognostic and diagnostic value of circRNA expression in prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'CSMD1 Shows Complex Patterns of Somatic Copy Number Alterations and Expressions of mRNAs and Target Micro RNAs in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.']"""

Moreover, we find that elevated CD51 expression in PCa specimens correlates with p53 loss of function. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that p53 acts via Sp1/3 to repress CD51 transcription, and CD51 is required for PCa stemness and metastasis properties, and is downregulated by p53.

This study sought to understand the clinical associations of cold spots (census tracts with worse income, education, and composite deprivation).  Methods:   Across 12 practices, we assessed the relationship between cold spots and clinical outcomes (obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, pneumonia vaccination, cancer screening-colon, cervical, and prostate-and aspirin chemoprophylaxis) for 152,962 patients. We geocoded and linked addresses to census tracts and assessed, at the census tract level, the percentage earning less than 200% of the Federal Poverty Level, without high school diplomas, and the social deprivation index (SDI). We labeled those census tracts in the worst quartiles as cold spots and conducted bivariate and logistic regression.  Results:   There was a 10-fold difference in the proportion of patients in cold spots between the highest (29.1%) and lowest practices (2.6%). Except for aspirin, all outcomes were influenced by cold spots. Fifteen percent of low-education cold-spot patients had uncontrolled diabetes compared with 13% of noncold-spot patients (P < .05). In regression, those in poverty, low education, and SDI cold spots were less likely to receive colon cancer screening (odds ratio [CI], 0.88 [0.83-0.93], 0.87 [0.82-0.92], and 0.89 [0.83-0.95], respectively) although cold-spot patients were more likely to receive cervical cancer screening.  Conclusion:   Living in cold spots is associated with worse chronic conditions and quality for some screening tests.

Materials and methods:   In the present study was determined the in vitro activity of known 1-3 and newly 4-6 synthesized compounds with high A3AR affinity and selectivity (Ki in the low nanomolar range) in binding studies. Effect of known and novel A3AR agonists on human prostate cancer (PC3), hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2), and epithelial colorectal carcinoma (Caco-2) cells were analysed by cytotoxicity assay, dose and time dependent inhibitor assay, migration, apoptosis, autophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays.  Key findings:   Results show that the anticancer effect is not due to A3AR activation alone. In fact, the more active and selective agonist versus A3AR, compound 1, results inactive on cancer cells such as compounds 2-4. Moreover, results show that the novel compound 5, at micromolar concentration range (IC50 = 28.0 μM), inhibits the growth of PC3, Hep G2, and Caco-2 cells and their migration in time- and dose- dependent manner. The mechanism involved in cell death is attributable to apoptosis. At the same time compound 5 promotes autophagy, which induce apoptosis producing autophagic cell death. Further investigation revealed that compound 5 elevates the level of ROS in all cancer cells tested, suggesting the involvement of ROS in cell death.

Members of the Canadian Medical Association identified 20 of these POEMs as most relevant to practice. This article reviews the clinical questions and bottom-line answers from these studies. Blood pressure should be measured after a period of rest, using a bare arm, and orthostatic blood pressure is more predictive when measured after one minute of standing rather than three minutes. Intensive blood pressure lowering results in cardiovascular benefits but also renal harms in high-risk patients with an average age of 68 years. The initiation of a statin for primary prevention does not reduce cardiovascular events in adults 65 years or older. Sterile gloves do not reduce the risk of infection for common outpatient skin procedures, and the preferred approach to managing onychomycosis is empiric oral terbinafine. Routine home glucose monitoring is not needed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and trying to achieve an A1C target level of 6.0% rather than 7.0% to 7.9% does not improve outcomes and may be harmful. Fasting blood glucose and A1C levels have limited accuracy for identifying glucose intolerance, and patients 65 years and older with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels between 4.6 and 10.0 mIU per mL should be rechecked before considering treatment. Gabapentin and pregabalin are not effective for acute or chronic low back pain, even in patients with sciatica. Physical therapy does not provide any additional benefit over usual care in patients with acute ankle sprain, and corticosteroid injections for knee osteoarthritis are ineffective and may damage cartilage. A two-question screening test can rule out depression in older adults; a large U.S. trial continued to find no benefit to prostate cancer screening; and clinicians need to be thoughtful about how they discuss recommendations to stop screening for cancer in older patients. Finally, ibuprofen, naproxen, and celecoxib have similar risks of adverse events, and continuous positive airway pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.""","""['Mark H Ebell', 'Roland Grad']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am Fam Physician""","""['Top 20 POEMs Should Provide Better Context of Study Quality and Scope.', 'Top 20 Research Studies of 2019 for Primary Care Physicians.', 'Top 20 Research Studies of 2015 for Primary Care Physicians.', 'Screening for Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults: An Evidence Update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Behavioral Counseling to Promote a Healthful Diet and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Adults Without Known Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors: Updated Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Behavioral Counseling to Promote a Healthy Lifestyle for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Persons With Cardiovascular Risk Factors: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.']"""

These cells, acquired non-invasively, represent a sample of highly relevant tumor tissue that is an alternative to difficult and low-yield tumor biopsies. In recent years, there has been growing interest in genomic profiling of CTCs to enable longitudinal monitoring of the tumor's adaptive response to therapy. However, due to their extreme rarity, genotyping CTCs has proved challenging. Relevant mutations can be masked by leukocyte contamination in isolates. Heterogeneity between subpopulations of tumor cells poses an additional obstacle. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing can overcome these limitations but isolation of single CTCs is prone to cell loss and is prohibitively difficult and time consuming. To address these limitations, we developed a single cell sample preparation and genome sequencing pipeline that combines biophysical enrichment and single cell isolation using laser capture microdissection (LCM). A key component of this process is the encapsulation of enriched CTC sample in a hydrogel matrix, which enhances the efficiency of single-cell isolation by LCM, and is compatible with downstream sequencing. We validated this process by sequencing of single CTCs and cell free DNA (cfDNA) from a single patient with castration resistant prostate cancer. Identical mutations were observed in prostate cancer driver genes (TP53, PTEN, FOXA1) in both single CTCs and cfDNA. However, two independently isolated CTCs also had identical missense mutations in the genes for ATR serine/threonine kinase, KMT2C histone methyltransferase, and FANCC DNA damage repair gene. These mutations may be missed by bulk sequencing libraries, whereas single cell sequencing could potentially enable the characterization of key CTC subpopulations that arise during metastasis.""","""['Emily S Park', 'Justin P Yan', 'Richard A Ang', 'Jeong Hyun Lee', 'Xiaoyan Deng', 'Simon P Duffy', 'Kevin Beja', 'Matti Annala', 'Peter C Black', 'Kim N Chi', 'Alexander W Wyatt', 'Hongshen Ma']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Lab Chip""","""['A comparison of isolated circulating tumor cells and tissue biopsies using whole-genome sequencing in prostate cancer.', 'Genomic Analysis of Localized High-Risk Prostate Cancer Circulating Tumor Cells at the Single-Cell Level.', 'An Accessible and Unique Insight into Metastasis Mutational Content Through Whole-exome Sequencing of Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Nanostructure embedded microchips for detection, isolation, and characterization of circulating tumor cells.', 'Sample Preparation Methods Following CellSearch Approach Compatible of Single-Cell Whole-Genome Amplification: An Overview.', 'Laser transfer for circulating tumor cell isolation in liquid biopsy.', 'Sequence-Based Platforms for Discovering Biomarkers in Liquid Biopsy of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.', 'See-N-Seq: RNA sequencing of target single cells identified by microscopy via micropatterning of hydrogel porosity.', 'Circulating tumor cell profiling for precision oncology.', 'Pairing Microwell Arrays with an Affordable, Semiautomated Single-Cell Aspirator for the Interrogation of Circulating Tumor Cell Heterogeneity.']"""

We established an androgen-independent LNCaPcell line (LNCaP-AI), and investigated the function of PRKAR2B on regulating cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. We found that PRKAR2B expression was markedly increased in LNCaP-AI cells and metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) tissues compared to LNCaP cells and primary PCa specimens, respectively. PRKAR2B level was significantly correlated with the Gleason score and lymph nodes metastasis in PCa. In vitro, PRKAR2B overexpression promoted cell invasion, whereas knockdown of PRKAR2B in CRPC cells inhibited cell invasion. PRKAR2B overexpression also promoted tumor metastasis in vivo. PRKAR2B resulted in a decreased expression of E-cadherin and an increased expression of Vimentin, N-cadherin, Fibronectin, indicating that PRKAR2B induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). PRKAR2B activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRPC cells. More important, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin attenuated PRKAR2B-induced EMT and cancer cells invasion.

Here, we performed gene expression profiling on p63-expressing prostatic carcinomas and compared them to usual-type adenocarcinoma. We identify ETS2 as highly expressed in p63-expressing prostatic carcinomas and benign prostate basal cells, with lower expression in luminal cells and primary usual-type adenocarcinomas.  Methods:   A total of 8 p63-expressing prostate carcinomas at radical prostatectomy were compared to 358 usual-type adenocarcinomas by gene expression profiling performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue using Affymetrix 1.0 ST microarrays. Correlation between differentially expressed genes and TP63 expression was performed in 5239 prostate adenocarcinomas available in the Decipher GRID. For validation, ETS2 in situ hybridization was performed on 19 p63-expressing prostate carcinomas and 30 usual-type adenocarcinomas arrayed on tissue microarrays (TMA).  Results:   By gene expression, p63-expressing prostate carcinomas showed low cell cycle activity and low Decipher prognostic scores, but were predicted to have high Gleason grade compared to usual-type adenocarcinomas by gene expression signatures and morphology. Among the genes over-expressed in p63-expressing carcinoma relative to usual-type adenocarcinoma were known p63-regulated genes, along with ETS2, an ETS family member previously implicated as a prostate cancer tumor suppressor gene. Across several cohorts of prostate samples, ETS2 gene expression was correlated with TP63 expression and was significantly higher in benign prostate compared to usual-type adenocarcinoma. By in situ hybridization, ETS2 gene expression was high in benign basal cells, and low to undetectable in benign luminal cells or usual-type adenocarcinoma. In contrast, ETS2 was highly expressed in 95% (18/19) of p63-expressing prostate carcinomas.  Conclusions:   ETS2 is a predominantly basally-expressed gene in the prostate, with low expression in usual-type adenocarcinoma and high expression in p63-expressing carcinomas.

The procoagulant molecule Tissue factor (TF), and the fibrinolysis inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 PAI-1 play important role in this complication. Extracellular vesicles (EV) shed from cancer cells may contribute to the regulation of TF and PAI-1. The procoagulant activity of EV can be associated with the oncogenic and metastatic characteristics of their cells.  Methods:   We have expressed EGFRvIII in DU145 cells to assess the role of this oncogene in the procoagulant activity of EV. The intercellular exchange of TF via EV was assessed by downregulating its expression in DU145 cells using shRNA vector, and determining the transfer of TF via EV enriched with the protein. Two PC cell lines with different metastatic potential were used to assess the correlation between the procoagulant activity of EV and the metastatic potential of PC cells. Photometric assays were used to determine FXa-activity and thrombin generation as indicators for the procoagulant activity of EV. Double-tagged proteinase-activated receptor 1(PAR-1) expressed in CHO cells to assess its activation by EV.  Results:   The expression of EGFRvIII in DU145 cells led to increased mRNA levels for TF and PAI-1, but the increase in these proteins expression was detected mostly in the EV. EV with enhanced levels of TF protein conferred higher TF procoagulant activity on the acceptor cells by intercellular exchange of this protein. Procoagulant activity of EV, assessed by FXa activity, and thrombin generation, was correlated with the oncogenic and metastatic potential of PC cells. The ability of EV to generate thrombin led to the activation of PAR-1, which was evident by the truncation of tagged-PAR-1.  Conclusion:   The active oncogene EGFRvIII increases the concentration of TF and PAI-1 in EV. The procoagulant activity of EV is associated with the oncogenic and metastatic characteristics of their PC cells. Also, EV may contribute to the high procoagulant activity in the tumour microenvironment by the intercellular exchange of TF. Finally, through the generation of thrombin, EV can activate PAR-1, which evidently contributes to cancer progression, linking the coagulation system to tumor progression.""","""['Hassan A Al Saleh', 'Sandor Haas-Neill', 'Ali Al-Hashimi', 'Anil Kapoor', 'Bobby Shayegan', 'Richard C Austin', 'Khalid Al-Nedawi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Breast-cancer extracellular vesicles induce platelet activation and aggregation by tissue factor-independent and -dependent mechanisms.', 'Procoagulant activity of extracellular vesicles as a potential biomarker for risk of thrombosis and DIC in patients with acute leukaemia.', 'Vincristine induces procoagulant activity of the human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Jurkat through the release of extracellular vesicles.', 'Statin drugs and dietary isoprenoids downregulate protein prenylation in signal transduction and are antithrombotic and prothrombolytic agents.', 'Protease-activated receptors (PARs)--biology and role in cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Pathophysiology of Coagulation and Emerging Roles for Extracellular Vesicles in Coagulation Cascades and Disorders.', 'Exosomal myeloperoxidase as a biomarker of deep venous thrombosis.', 'Non-Coding RNAs: Emerging Therapeutic Targets in Spinal Cord Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.', 'Exosomes and organ-specific metastasis.', 'PAR2 Activation on Human Kidney Tubular Epithelial Cells Induces Tissue Factor Synthesis, That Enhances Blood Clotting.']"""

Cu-TA showed higher anti-proliferative activity, and the IC50 values were 30 to 80% lower when compared with TA. H9C2 cells were non-responsive to Cu-TA, suggesting that it is selective towards malignant cells.

Methods: The CCK-8 assay was used to assess the viability of prostate cancer cells. The cell morphology was examined by an ultrastructural analysis via transmission electron microscopy. Cells in apoptosis (early and late stages) were detected using an Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide kit with a FACSCaliber flow cytometer. JC-1, a cationic lipophilic probe, was employed to measure the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of PC3 cells. Changes in the protein expression of RIPK1, C-RIPK1, caspase 8, cleaved-caspase 8, Bim, Bid, caspase 10, and cleaved-caspase 10 were evaluated by Western blotting. The mRNA expression of Bim was examined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Z-VAD-FMK (a caspase inhibitor) and necrostatin-1 (a specific inhibitor of RIPK1) were utilized to determine whether the cell death was mediated by RIPK1 or caspases. PC3 and DU145 xenograft models in BALB/c nude mice were used to evaluate the anticancer activity of OPD' in vivo. Results: OPD' was shown to exert potent anti-tumor activity against PC3 cells. It induced apoptosis via a RIPK1-related pathway, increased the protein expression levels of RIPK1 and Bim, and decreased the levels of cleaved-RIPK1, caspase 8, cleaved-caspase 8, Bid, caspase 10, and cleaved-caspase 10.

Little is known about the role of NDRG3 in the cellular adaptation to hypoxia, whereas the roles of HIFs are well understood. In this study, we investigated how NDRG3 affects the hypoxic response in prostate cancer cells. Compared with HIF-1α, hypoxic induction of NDRG3 was observed at a later phase. NDRG3 reduced hypoxic expression of HIF-1α by inhibiting AKT-driven translation of HIF1A mRNA. In addition, NDRG3 functionally inhibited HIF-1 by dissociating the coactivator p300 from HIF-1α. Accordingly, NDRG3 may fine-tune the HIF-1 signaling pathway to cope with long-term hypoxia. Of the diverse effects of HIF-1α on cancer progression, hypoxia-induced cell migration was investigated. In transwell chambers, NDRG3 negatively regulated the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells under hypoxia. An informatics analysis using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) revealed that NDRG3 downregulation is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and high expression of HIF-1 downstream genes. In cancer tissue arrays, NDRG3 expression was lower in prostate cancer tissues with a Gleason score of 8 or greater and was inversely correlated with HIF-1α expression.

Here we develop and validate a gene expression signature to predict response to postoperative ADT.Experimental Design: A training set consisting of 284 radical prostatectomy patients was established after 1:1 propensity score matching metastasis between adjuvant-ADT (a-ADT)-treated and no ADT-treated groups. An ADT Response Signature (ADT-RS) was identified from neuroendocrine and AR signaling-related genes. Two independent cohorts were used to form three separate data sets for validation (set I, n = 232; set II, n = 435; set III, n = 612). The primary endpoint of the analysis was postoperative metastasis.Results: Increases in ADT-RS score were associated with a reduction in risk of metastasis only in a-ADT patients. On multivariable analysis, ADT-RS by ADT treatment interaction term remained associated with metastasis in both validation sets (set I: HR = 0.18, Pinteraction = 0.009; set II: HR = 0.25, Pinteraction = 0.019). In a matched validation set III, patients with Low ADT-RS scores had similar 10-year metastasis rates in the a-ADT and no-ADT groups (30.1% vs. 31.0%, P = 0.989). Among High ADT-RS patients, 10-year metastasis rates were significantly lower for a-ADT versus no-ADT patients (9.4% vs. 29.2%, P = 0.021). The marginal ADT-RS by ADT interaction remained significant in the matched dataset (Pinteraction = 0.035).Conclusions: Patients with High ADT-RS benefited from a-ADT. In combination with prognostic risk factors, use of ADT-RS may thus allow for identification of ADT-responsive tumors that may benefit most from early androgen blockade after radical prostatectomy. We discovered a gene signature that when present in primary prostate tumors may be useful to predict patients who may respond to early ADT after surgery.

Using a mouse PDX tumor model containing human metastatic prostate cancer, Rab11 family interacting protein 5 (Rab11-FIP5) was identified as a lead candidate for α6β1 trafficking. Rab11-FIP5 and its membrane-binding domain were required for α6β1 recycling, without affecting the other laminin-binding integrin (i.e., α3β1) or unrelated membrane receptors like CD44, transferrin receptor, or E-cadherin. Depletion of Rab11-FIP5 resulted in the intracellular accumulation of α6β1 in the Rab11 recycling compartment, loss of cell migration on laminin, and an unexpected loss of α6β1 recycling in cell-cell locations. Taken together, these data demonstrate that α6β1 is distinct from α3β1 via Rab11-FIP5 recycling and recycles in an unexpected cell-cell location.Implications: Rab11-FIP5-dependent α6β1 integrin recycling may be selectively targeted to limit migration of prostate cancer cells into laminin-rich tissues.

After DNA extraction from each sample, HPV-DNA amplification and genotyping were performed using Luminex multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Participants completed a questionnaire on their age, education, smoking status, sexuality, age of sexual debut, marital status, and present history of sexually transmitted infections.  Results:   Data from 803 patients were included in the analysis. Overall HPV and high-risk (HR)HPV prevalence in urine samples were 6.2% and 3.1%, respectively. HPV and HR-HPV prevalences were the highest in men with urethritis, and were significantly higher than those without urethritis. HPV detection was the most common in men aged 40-49 years, although significant detection differences were not age-related. Urethritis was an independent risk factor for HPV detection from urine samples, with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.548 (95%CI; 1.802-11.476) (p = 0.001).

Objective:   To determine whether the preoperative anatomical and functional features of the sphincter complex and the degree of nerve-sparing affect long-term continence after RARP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective study of 529 patients who underwent RARP at a single tertiary center.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Anatomical factors, including membranous urethral length (MUL) and pelvic diaphragm length (PDL), were assessed using sagittal views of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. MUL was defined as the distance from the posterior prostate apex to the urethra level at the penile bulb, and PDL was defined as the length of the urethra that met the planes created by the pelvic floor muscles. Functional parameters including maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) and functional urethral length were evaluated using preoperative measurements of the urethral pressure profiles. The degree of nerve-sparing was stratified as bilateral, unilateral, or none. Continence (pad-free status) was assessed according to anatomical and functional factors and nerve-sparing. We used binary logistic regression to assess factors predicting continence return 12 mo after RARP.  Results and limitations:   Continence return rates 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo after RARP were 39.7%, 66.0%, 80.2%, and 87.0%, respectively. Continence return rates at 12 mo differed significantly in patients with MUL ≥11.7mm (91.9%) and <11.7mm (79.9%), PDL ≥9.9mm (96.7%) and <9.9mm (74.5%), and MUCP ≥66 cmH2O (89.7%) and <66 cmH2O (79.4%). The continence return rate was significantly higher in patients with bilateral (93.0%) than in patients with unilateral (78.1%) or no (76.7%) nerve-sparing. Multivariate analysis showed that PDL (odds ratio [OR]=2.187 per mm), MUCP (OR=1.037 per cmH2O), and bilateral nerve-sparing (OR=3.671) were independently associated with continence return 12 mo after RALP.  Conclusions:   The anatomical length and static pressure of the sphincter complex affected continence after RARP. Bilateral nerve-sparing was independently associated with long-term continence.

The second is a C-C bond scission or ""lyase"" reaction in which the C17-C20 bond is cleaved, leading to the eventual production of powerful androgens, whose involvement in the proliferation of prostate cancer has generated intense interest in developing inhibitors of CYP17A1. For humans, the significance of the C-C bond cleavage of 17-OH PROG is lessened, because it is about 50 times less efficient than for 17-OH PREG in terms of kcat/Km. Recognizing the need to clarify relevant reaction mechanisms involved with such transformations, we first report studies of solvent isotope effects, results of which are consistent with a Compound I mediated PROG hydroxylase activity, yet exclude this intermediate as a participant in the formation of androstenedione (AD) via the lyase reaction. This finding is also supported by a combination of cryoreduction and resonance Raman spectroscopy that traps and structurally characterizes the key hemiketal reaction intermediates. Adding to a previous study of PREG and 17-OH PREG metabolism, the current work provides definitive evidence for a more facile protonation of the initially formed ferric peroxo-intermediate for 17-OH PROG-bound CYP17A1, compared to the complex with 17-OH PREG. Importantly, Raman characterization also reveals an H-bonding interaction with the terminal oxygen of the peroxo fragment, rather than with the proximal oxygen, as is present for 17-OH PREG. These factors would favor a diminished lyase activity of the sample with 17-OH PROG relative to the complex with 17-OH PREG, thereby providing a convincing structural explanation for the dramatic differences in activity for these lyase substrates in humans.""","""['Piotr J Mak', 'Ruchia Duggal', 'Ilia G Denisov', 'Michael C Gregory', 'Stephen G Sligar', 'James R Kincaid']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Am Chem Soc""","""['Importance of Asparagine 202 in Manipulating Active Site Structure and Substrate Preference for Human CYP17A1.', 'Mechanism of the Clinically Relevant E305G Mutation in Human P450 CYP17A1.', 'P450 CYP17A1 Variant with a Disordered Proton Shuttle Assembly Retains Peroxo-Mediated Lyase Efficiency.', 'Environmental inhibitors of the expression of cytochrome P450 17A1 in mammals.', 'Structural insights into the function of steroidogenic cytochrome P450 17A1.', 'Non-steroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitors: Discovery and Assessment.', 'Solvent isotope effects in the catalytic cycle of P450 CYP17A1: Computational modeling of the hydroxylation and lyase reactions.', 'Melatonin Activation by Cytochrome P450 Isozymes: How Does CYP1A2 Compare to CYP1A1?', 'Androgen Metabolism and Response in Prostate Cancer Anti-Androgen Therapy Resistance.', 'Importance of Asparagine 202 in Manipulating Active Site Structure and Substrate Preference for Human CYP17A1.']"""

Given mixed findings regarding how gender role conflict interacts with emotional approach coping to regulate distress in prostate cancer patients, the present study examined the effects of emotional approach coping, when considered alongside self-compassion, the ability to be kind and understanding of oneself.  Method:   Ninety-two prostate cancer patients completed questionnaires measuring gender role conflict, emotional approach coping, self-compassion, and distress. A moderated mediation model was tested, where emotional approach coping mediated the path between gender role conflict and distress and self-compassion moderated paths between (1) gender role conflict and emotional approach coping, and (2) gender role conflict and distress.  Results:   Results partially supported this model with all study variables predicting distress in the expected directions. Emotional approach coping did not mediate associations between gender role conflict and distress; however, self-compassion did moderate the pathway between these variables.

Thestress-response kinase homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (HIPK1) phosphorylates two residues in PAGE4, serine 9 and threonine 51. Phosphorylation of these two residues facilitates the interaction of PAGE4 with activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex to potentiate AP-1's activity. In contrast, hyperphosphorylation of PAGE4 by CDC-like kinase 2 (CLK2) attenuates this interaction with AP-1. Small-angleX-ray scattering and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements have shown that PAGE4 expands upon hyperphosphorylation and that this expansion is localized to its N-terminal half. To understand the interactions underlying this structural transition, we performed molecular dynamics simulations using Atomistic AWSEM, a multi-scale molecular model that combines atomistic and coarse-grained simulation approaches. Our simulations show that electrostatic interactions drive transient formation of an N-terminal loop, the destabilization of which accounts for the dramatic change in size upon hyperphosphorylation. Phosphorylation also changes the preference of secondary structure formation of the PAGE4 ensemble, which leads to a transition between states that display different degrees of disorder. Finally, we construct a mechanism-based mathematical model that allows us to capture the interactions ofdifferent phosphoforms of PAGE4 with AP-1 and its downstream target, the androgen receptor (AR)-a key therapeutic target in prostate cancer. Our model predicts intracellular oscillatory dynamics of HIPK1-PAGE4, CLK2-PAGE4, and AR activity, indicating phenotypic heterogeneity in an isogenic cell population.

At our institution we have used an aggressive biopsy strategy in younger patients with prostate specific antigen 1 ng/ml or greater. Our objective was to determine the proportion of detected cancer and specifically clinically significant cancer by this strategy.  Materials and methods:   The prostate biopsy database at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre was queried for patients younger than 50 years who underwent a first prostate biopsy between 2000 and 2016. We included only patients who underwent prostate biopsy due to prostate specific antigen 1 ng/ml or greater and those with a suspicious digital rectal examination, a positive family history or a suspicious lesion on transrectal ultrasound. All clinical and pathological parameters were analyzed. Patients were stratified according to specific prostate specific antigen values. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to ascertain predictors of any prostate cancer diagnosis and of clinically significant prostate cancer.  Results:   Of the 199 patients who met study inclusion criteria 37 (19%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 8 (22%) had a Gleason score of 7 or greater. Of those diagnosed with prostate cancer 25 (68%) had prostate specific antigen 1.5 ng/ml or greater and all men with a Gleason score of 7 or greater had prostate specific antigen 1.5 ng/ml or greater. Notably 19 patients (51%) had prostate cancer exceeding the Epstein criteria for active surveillance. Factors predicting prostate cancer included a positive family history, rising prostate specific antigen and lower prostate volume.  Conclusions:   Our results justify adopting an aggressive prostate biopsy strategy in men younger than 50 years with prostate specific antigen 1.5 ng/ml or greater while patients with prostate specific antigen less than 1.5 ng/ml are unlikely to have significant cancer.

We sought to define an optimum cutoff point for prostate specific antigen density and assess how race and body mass index affects prostate specific antigen density performance.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed data on 2,162 men, of whom 56% were African American, with serum prostate specific antigen 4 to 10 ng/ml who underwent prostate biopsy. We compared the AUC between prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen density to predict clinically significant and any prostate cancer vs no cancer. We calculated the negative predictive value of prostate specific antigen density cutoff points ranging from 0.05 to 0.15 by every 0.01 step. We a priori defined the optimal cutoff point of prostate specific antigen density as a negative predictive value of 95% and tested whether the cutoff was sensitive to body mass index and race by comparing the negative predictive value across strata.  Results:   Median prostate specific antigen was 5.6 ng/ml (IQR 4.8-7) and median prostate specific antigen density was 0.15 ng/ml/cc (IQR 0.1-0.22). Prostate specific antigen density improved the performance of prostate specific antigen to detect significant cancer (AUC 0.58 to 0.68) and any cancer (AUC 0.55 to 0.69, each p <0.001). We identified a prostate specific antigen density cutoff point of less than 0.08 ng/ml/cc with a 96% negative predictive value for grade group 2 or greater. This was largely unchanged among different races and body mass indexes.  Conclusions:   Regardless of race or body mass index men with prostate specific antigen density less than 0.08 were unlikely to harbor grade group 2 or greater disease when prostate specific antigen was 4 to 10 ng/ml. If validated, prostate specific antigen density is a simple inexpensive and available tool that can be used to identify men who can likely forego prostate biopsies, thus reducing the over detection and morbidity of unnecessary biopsies.""","""['Alireza Aminsharifi', 'Lauren Howard', 'Yuan Wu', 'Amanda De Hoedt', 'Charlotte Bailey', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Thomas J Polascik']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Re: Prostate Specific Antigen Density as a Predictor of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer when the Prostate Specific Antigen is in the Diagnostic Gray Zone: .: A.

We evaluated the status of serum HCG in men with elevated gonadotropins, which were induced by androgen deprivation therapy, using commercially available assays.  Materials and methods:   We enrolled 44 patients with prostate cancer, who underwent luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone agonist treatment. We measured serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), serum luteinizing hormone (LH), serum total HCG, serum free HCG-β subunit, and urine total HCG 3 times per patient, on the day of treatment initiation, the next day, and 3 months after.  Results:   On the day after treatment initiation, serum and urine HCG was detected in 61% and 73% of patients, respectively. Markedly strong correlations were observed between serum/urine HCG and FSH/LH. In particular, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated excellent area under the curve (0.977, 95% confidence interval 0.951-1.003)) for serum HCG-detectable LH.

This can be partially attributed to the need for a trained operator during acquisition and interpretation of the images. We introduce and evaluate an algorithm that can propose a patient-specific transperineal ultrasound probe setup, based on a CT scan and anatomical structure delineations. The use of this setup during the simulation and treatment stage could improve usability of ultrasound imaging for relatively untrained operators (radiotherapists with less than 1 yr experience with ultrasound).  Methods:   The internal perineum boundaries of three prostate cancer patients were identified based on bone masks extracted from their CT scans. After projection of these boundaries to the skin and exclusion of specific areas, this resulted in a skin area accessible for transperineal ultrasound probe placement in clinical practice. Several possible probe setups on this area were proposed by the algorithm and the optimal setup was automatically selected. In the end, this optimal setup was evaluated based on a comparison with a corresponding transperineal ultrasound volume acquired by a radiation oncologist.  Results:   The algorithm-proposed setups allowed visualization of 100% of the clinically required anatomical structures, including the whole prostate and seminal vesicles, as well as the adjacent edges of the bladder and rectum. In addition, these setups allowed visualization of 94% of the anatomical structures, which were also visualized by the physician during the acquisition of an actual ultrasound volume.  Conclusion:   Provided that the ultrasound probe setup proposed by the algorithm, is properly reproduced on the patient, it allows visualization of all clinically required structures for image guided radiotherapy purposes.

Treatment options are limited, ineffective, and, for most patients, result in death in less than a year. We previously developed a first-in-field patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of NEtD. Longitudinal deep transcriptome profiling of this model enabled monitoring of dynamic transcriptional changes during NEtD and in the context of androgen deprivation. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are implicated in cancer where they can control gene regulation. Until now, the expression of lncRNAs during NEtD and their clinical associations were unexplored.  Results:   We implemented a next-generation sequence analysis pipeline that can detect transcripts at low expression levels and built a genome-wide catalogue (n = 37,749) of lncRNAs. We applied this pipeline to 927 clinical samples and our high-fidelity NEtD model LTL331 and identified 821 lncRNAs in NEPC. Among these are 122 lncRNAs that robustly distinguish NEPC from prostate adenocarcinoma (AD) patient tumours. The highest expressed lncRNAs within this signature are H19, LINC00617, and SSTR5-AS1. Another 742 are associated with the NEtD process and fall into four distinct patterns of expression (NEtD lncRNA Class I, II, III, and IV) in our PDX model and clinical samples. Each class has significant (z-scores >2) and unique enrichment for transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs in their sequences. Enriched TFBS include (1) TP53 and BRN1 in Class I, (2) ELF5, SPIC, and HOXD1 in Class II, (3) SPDEF in Class III, (4) HSF1 and FOXA1 in Class IV, and (5) TWIST1 when merging Class III with IV. Common TFBS in all NEtD lncRNA were also identified and include E2F, REST, PAX5, PAX9, and STAF. Interrogation of the top deregulated candidates (n = 100) in radical prostatectomy adenocarcinoma samples with long-term follow-up (median 18 years) revealed significant clinicopathological associations. Specifically, we identified 25 that are associated with rapid metastasis following androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Two of these lncRNAs (SSTR5-AS1 and LINC00514) stratified patients undergoing ADT based on patient outcome.  Discussion:   To date, a comprehensive characterization of the dynamic landscape of lncRNAs during the NEtD process has not been performed. A temporal analysis of the PDX-based NEtD model has for the first time provided this dynamic landscape. TFBS analysis identified NEPC-related TF motifs present within the NEtD lncRNA sequences, suggesting functional roles for these lncRNAs in NEPC pathogenesis. Furthermore, select NEtD lncRNAs appear to be associated with metastasis and patients receiving ADT. Treatment-related metastasis is a clinical consequence of NEPC tumours. Top candidate lncRNAs FENDRR, H19, LINC00514, LINC00617, and SSTR5-AS1 identified in this study are implicated in the development of NEPC. We present here for the first time a genome-wide catalogue of NEtD lncRNAs that characterize the transdifferentiation process and a robust NEPC lncRNA patient expression signature. To accomplish this, we carried out the largest integrative study that applied a PDX NEtD model to clinical samples. These NEtD and NEPC lncRNAs are strong candidates for clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets and warrant further investigation.""","""['Varune Rohan Ramnarine', 'Mohammed Alshalalfa', 'Fan Mo', 'Noushin Nabavi', 'Nicholas Erho', 'Mandeep Takhar', 'Robert Shukin', 'Sonal Brahmbhatt', 'Alexander Gawronski', 'Maxim Kobelev', 'Mannan Nouri', 'Dong Lin', 'Harrison Tsai', 'Tamara L Lotan', 'R Jefferey Karnes', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Cenk Sahinalp', 'Alexander W Wyatt', 'Stanislav V Volik', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Colin C Collins']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Gigascience""","""['The β2-Adrenergic Receptor Is a Molecular Switch for Neuroendocrine Transdifferentiation of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The long noncoding RNA H19 regulates tumor plasticity in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Conditionally Reprogrammed Cells from Patient-Derived Xenograft to Model Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Development.', 'The role of epigenetics and long noncoding RNA MIAT in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'The epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'A systematic method introduced a common lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in the different stages of prostate cancer.', 'Targeting PHB1 to inhibit castration-resistant prostate cancer progression in vitro and in vivo.', 'MiR-124-3p inhibits tumor progression in prostate cancer by targeting EZH2.', 'Specific classification and new therapeutic targets for neuroendocrine prostate cancer: A patient-based, diagnostic study.', 'Candidate Genes in Testing Strategies for Linkage Analysis and Bioinformatic Sorting of Whole Genome Sequencing Data in Three Small Japanese Families with Idiopathic Superior Oblique Muscle Palsy.']"""

Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) for prostate cancer are hampered by tumor heterogeneity and its complex microevolution dynamics. Traditional prostate cancer mouse models include, amongst others, germline and conditional knockouts, transgenic expression of oncogenes, and xenograft models. Generation of de novo mutations in these models is complex, time-consuming, and costly. In addition, most of traditional models target the majority of the prostate epithelium, whereas human prostate cancer is well known to evolve as an isolated event in only a small subset of cells. Valuable models need to simulate not only prostate cancer initiation, but also progression to advanced disease. Here we describe a method to target a few cells in the prostate epithelium by transducing cells by viral particles. The delivery of an engineered virus to the murine prostate allows alteration of gene expression in the prostate epithelia. Virus type and quantity will hereby define the number of targeted cells for gene alteration by transducing a few cells for cancer initiation and many cells for gene therapy. Through surgery-based injection in the anterior lobe, distal from the urinary track, the tumor in this model can expand without impairing the urinary function of the animal. Furthermore, by targeting only a subset of prostate epithelial cells the technique enables clonal expansion of the tumor, and therefore mimics human tumor initiation, progression, as well as invasion through the basal membrane.

Materials and methods:   A total of 282 PCa cases were evaluated, which included 252 localized PCa, 8 metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and 22 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) cases. Samples were collected from patients who underwent RP or transurethral resection and were stored in ethically approved tissue banks. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed for AR and ARVs. Each tissue was confirmed as cancerous (greater than 80%) using hematoxylin and eosin staining. AR and ARVs expression was compared according to disease status. The biochemical recurrence free survival (BCRFS) rates in men with localized PCa was analyzed according to AR and ARV7 expression using the Kaplan-Meier curve.  Results:   Only 58 of the 252 localized PCa were included in the analysis because of insufficient cancer tissue. AR and ARV7 mRNA expression was higher in the CRPC tissue than in the localized PCa tissue (p=0.025, p=0.002, respectively). In localized PCa tissue, high AR mRNA and protein level was associated with a low BCRFS rate (log-ranked, p=0.019, p<0.001, respectively).  Conclusions:   Overall AR and ARV7 mRNA expression levels were increased in CRPC tissues compared to localized PCa and BPH tissues. High AR protein and mRNA expression in the tumor tissue may be considered a predictive factor of BCRFS following RP.""","""['Sung Woo Park', 'Jung Hee Kim', 'Hyun Jung Lee', 'Dong Hoon Shin', 'Sang Don Lee', 'Sik Yoon']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""World J Mens Health""","""['High level of androgen receptor is associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and decreased biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate: cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Transcript Levels of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 and Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 2C in Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'ARv7 Represses Tumor-Suppressor Genes in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Clinical implication of prognostic and predictive biomarkers for castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Questioning the evidence behind the Saturation Model for testosterone replacement therapy in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively identified patients receiving whole-gland prostate ablation with high-intensity focused ultrasound for localized prostate cancer from 2009 to 2015. All the patients received pre-high-intensity focused ultrasound radical transurethral resection of the prostate. We included perioperative parameters as follows: age, preoperative prostate volume, stage of operation, initial prostate-specific antigen, T stage, postoperative prostate-specific antigen nadir, Gleason score, time to prostate-specific antigen nadir and the presence of prostate-specific antigen biochemical recurrence. Multivariable Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used for investigating predictors of recurrence, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was used for the cut-off values of prostate-specific antigen nadir.  Results:   Among 182 patients, 26.9% had prostate-specific antigen biochemical recurrence after high-intensity focused ultrasound during the median follow-up period of 32.21 months. Gleason score ≥7 (Gleason score 7, hazard ratio 2.877, P = 0.027), stage ≥T2b (T2b, hazard ratio 3.16, P = 0.027) and prostate-specific antigen nadir (hazard ratio 1.11, P < 0.001) were statistically significant, whereas there was no significance in prostate volume and initial prostate-specific antigen. We posit that a cut-off level of prostate-specific antigen nadir 0.43 ng/mL might be considered as an independent predictive factor for prostate-specific antigen biochemical recurrence in high-intensity focused ultrasound patients in multivariate analysis (P < 0.001, hazard ratio 7.39, 95% confidence interval 3.56-15.37), and created a new nadir-related prediction model for biochemical recurrence prediction.  Conclusions:   Postoperative prostate-specific antigen nadir of 0.43 ng/mL can be considered an important predictive factor for biochemical recurrence in primary whole-prostate gland high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment, and the nadir-related prediction model might provide a reference for early salvage treatment. Furthermore, Gleason score ≥7, stage ≥T2b might be associated with unfavorable outcomes, although prostate volume and higher initial prostate-specific antigen appear not to be associated with biochemical recurrence for the high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment.""","""['Po Yen Chen', 'Po Hui Chiang', 'Yi Yang Liu', 'Yao Chi Chuang', 'Yuan Tso Cheng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Predictors of prostate-specific antigen biochemical recurrence in patients undergoing primary whole-gland prostate cryoablation.', 'Predictors of biochemical recurrence after Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Analysis of 359 cases with a median follow-up period of 26\xa0months.', 'High-intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) as salvage therapy for radio-recurrent prostate cancer: predictors of disease response.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: 5-year experience.', 'Focal Treatment for Unilateral Prostate Cancer Using High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound: A Comprehensive Study of Pooled Data.', 'Incorporating VR-RENDER Fusion Software in Robot-Assisted Partial Prostatectomy: The First Case Report.', 'Salvage Radiotherapy Plus Androgen Deprivation Therapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer with Biochemical Failure after High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound as Primary Treatment.', 'Single-Center Evaluation of Treatment Success Using Two Different Protocols for MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Cohort study of high-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of localised prostate cancer treatment: Medium-term results from a single centre.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of prostate tissue in patients with localized prostate cancer: single-center evaluation of 6-month treatment safety and functional outcomes of intensified treatment parameters.']"""

Because biopsy variables associated with pathology have uncertainty regarding individual patient differences, a method for classification according to these variables is needed.  Method:   We propose a deep belief network and Dempster-Shafer- (DBN-DS-) based multiclassifier for the pathologic prediction of prostate cancer. The DBN-DS learns prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, and clinical T stage variable information using three DBNs. Uncertainty regarding the predicted output was removed from the DBN and combined with information from DS to make a correct decision.  Result:   The new method was validated on pathology data from 6342 patients with prostate cancer. The pathology stages consisted of organ-confined disease (OCD; 3892 patients) and non-organ-confined disease (NOCD; 2453 patients). The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed DBN-DS was 81.27%, which is higher than the 64.14% of the Partin table.  Conclusion:   The proposed DBN-DS is more effective than other methods in predicting pathology stage.

To this end, we developed a fluorine-18 labeled corticosteroid termed GR02 that potently binds the endogenous ligand binding pocket on full length GR. Binding of 18F-GR02 was suppressed in many normal tissues by co-treatment with mifepristone, a GR antagonist in human use, and was elevated in many normal tissues among mice lacking circulating corticosteroids due to adrenalectomy. 18F-GR02 also accumulated in GR positive subcutaneous and subrenal capsule prostate cancer models, and uptake in tumors was competed by mifepristone.

Silibinin, a widely used drug and supplement for various liver disorders, demonstrated anti-cancer effects on human hepatocellular carcinoma, human prostate adenocarcinoma cells, human breast carcinoma cells, human ectocervical carcinoma cells, and human colon cancer cells. Considering the anti-hepatotoxic activity of silibinin and its strong preventive and anti-cancer efficacy against various epithelial cancers, we investigated the efficacy of silibinin against human HCC and HUVEC cell lines. Silibinin effects on the growth and mode of cell death of these two cell lines are presented in this paper. HepG2 and HUVEC cells were incubated with different doses of silibinin (12.5, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 μg/mL) at 24, 48, and 72 h. Cytotoxicity was assessed using MTT and Trypan blue assays. Mode of cell death induced by silibinin was investigated using LDH assay and acridine orange/PI double dye staining. The results showed that silibinin has dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the viability of HepG2 and HUVEC cells. However, Silibinin causes a more continuous dose-dependent cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells compared to the HUVEC cells in which some degrees of resistance is apparent at the beginning. The mode of cell death looks also different in these two cell lines with HepG2 cells being more in favor of apoptosis while necrosis is more evident for the HUVEC cells.""","""['Niki Vakili Zahir', 'Maryam Nakhjavani', 'Parastoo Hajian', 'Farshad H Shirazi', 'Hamidreza Mirzaei']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Iran J Pharm Res""","""['Silibinin efficacy against human hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Combined treatment with silibinin and either sorafenib or gefitinib enhances their growth-inhibiting effects in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of silibinin in rat prostate cancer cells.', 'Silibinin strongly inhibits growth and survival of human endothelial cells via cell cycle arrest and downregulation of survivin, Akt and NF-kappaB: implications for angioprevention and antiangiogenic therapy.', 'Silibinin: an old drug for hematological disorders.', 'Diallyl Disulfide Induces Chemosensitization to Sorafenib, Autophagy, and Cell Cycle Arrest and Inhibits Invasion in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Natural Blockers of PD-1/PD-L1 Interaction for the Immunotherapy of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer-Brain Metastasis.', 'Effect of Zebularine on p16INK4a, p14ARF, p15INK4b, and DNA Methyltransferase 1 Gene Expression, Cell Growth Inhibition, and Apoptosis Induction in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma PLC/PRF5 and Pancreatic Cancer PA-TU-8902 Cell Lines.', 'Collagen Nanoparticle-Mediated Brain Silymarin Delivery: An Approach for Treating Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion-Induced Brain Injury.', 'Silibinin down-regulates PD-L1 expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by interfering with tumor cell glycolytic metabolism.']"""

In addition, LCN2 limits bacterial growth by sequestering iron-containing siderophores and further protects against intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis associated with alterations in the microbiota. Human LCN2 contains one N-glycosylation site conserved in other species. It was postulated that this post-translational modification could facilitate protein folding, protects from proteolysis, is required for proper trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, and might be relevant for effective secretion. We here show that the homologous nucleoside antibiotic tunicamycin blocks N-linked glycosylation but not secretion of LCN2 in primary murine hepatocytes, derivatives thereof, human lung carcinoma cell line A549, and human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Moreover, both the glycosylated and the non-glycosylated LCN2 variants are equally targeted to exosomes, demonstrating that this post-translational modification is not necessary for proper trafficking of LCN2 into these membranous extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, a hydrophobic cluster analysis revealed that the N-glycosylation site is embedded in a highly hydrophobic evolutionarily conserved surrounding. In sum, our data indicate that the N-glycosylation of LCN2 is not required for proper secretion and exosome cargo recruitment in different cell types, but might be relevant to increase overall solubility.""","""['Erawan Borkham-Kamphorst', 'Eddy Van de Leur', 'Steffen K Meurer', 'Eva M Buhl', 'Ralf Weiskirchen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Altered mitochondrial and peroxisomal integrity in lipocalin-2-deficient mice with hepatic steatosis.', 'Lipocalin-2 in Diabetic Complications of the Nervous System: Physiology, Pathology, and Beyond.', 'Hepatocytes and neutrophils cooperatively suppress bacterial infection by differentially regulating lipocalin-2 and neutrophil extracellular traps.', 'Lipocalin 2 imparts selective pressure on bacterial growth in the bladder and is elevated in women with urinary tract infection.', 'Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) Expression in Hepatic Malfunction and Therapy.', 'Advances in Ferritin Physiology and Possible Implications in Bacterial Infection.', 'Lectin-Based Study Reveals the Presence of Disease-Relevant Glycoepitopes in Bladder Cancer Cells and Ectosomes.', 'NOX activation in reactive astrocytes regulates astrocytic LCN2 expression and neurodegeneration.', 'Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) Deficiency Leads to Cellular Changes in Highly Metastatic Human Prostate Cancer Cell Line PC-3.', 'Epigenetic induction of lipocalin 2 expression drives acquired resistance to 5-fluorouracil in colorectal cancer through integrin β3/SRC pathway.']"""

Our findings explain why USP12 is one of the 12 most commonly overexpressed cancer-associated genes located near an amplified super-enhancer. We find that USP12 deubiquitinates MDM2 and AR, which in turn controls the levels of the TP53 tumour suppressor and AR oncogene in prostate cancer.

Although the endothelial Akt1 loss in mice had no significant effect on RM1 tumour xenograft growth in vivo, it promoted metastasis to the lungs compared to the wild-type mice. Mechanistically, Akt1-deficient endothelial cells exhibited increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated β-catenin, and reduced expression of tight-junction proteins claudin-5, ZO-1 and ZO-2. Pharmacological inhibition of β-catenin nuclear translocation using compounds ICG001 and IWR-1 restored HLEC tight-junction integrity and inhibited prostate cancer cell transendothelial migration in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo.

Elevated Hyal1 accelerates vesicular trafficking in prostate tumor cells, thereby enhancing their metastatic potential in an autocrine manner through increased motility and proliferation. In this report, we found Hyal1 protein is a component of exosomes produced by prostate tumor cell lines overexpressing Hyal1. We investigated the role of exosomally shed Hyal1 in modulating tumor cell autonomous functions and in modifying the behavior of prostate stromal cells. Catalytic activity of Hyal1 was necessary for enrichment of Hyal1 in the exosome fraction, which was associated with increased presence of LC3BII, an autophagic marker, in the exosomes. Hyal1-positive exosome contents were internalized from the culture medium by WPMY-1 prostate stromal fibroblasts. Treatment of prostate stromal cells with tumor exosomes did not affect proliferation, but robustly stimulated their migration in a manner dependent on Hyal1 catalytic activity. Increased motility of exosome-treated stromal cells was accompanied by enhanced adhesion to a type IV collagen matrix, as well as increased FAK phosphorylation and integrin engagement through dynamic membrane residence of β1 integrins. The presence of Hyal1 in tumor-derived exosomes and its ability to impact the behavior of stromal cells suggests cell-cell communication via exosomes is a novel mechanism by which elevated Hyal1 promotes prostate cancer progression.""","""['Caitlin O McAtee', 'Christine Booth', 'Christian Elowsky', 'Lei Zhao', 'Jeremy Payne', 'Teresa Fangman', 'Steve Caplan', 'Michael D Henry', 'Melanie A Simpson']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Matrix Biol""","""['Stromal and epithelial expression of tumor markers hyaluronic acid and HYAL1 hyaluronidase in prostate cancer.', 'Hyaluronidase Hyal1 Increases Tumor Cell Proliferation and Motility through Accelerated Vesicle Trafficking.', 'c-Src, Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Receptor, G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinases and Focal Adhesion Kinase are Enriched Into Prostate Cancer Cell Exosomes.', 'Focal adhesion kinase controls prostate cancer progression via intrinsic kinase and scaffolding functions.', 'Emerging views of integrin signaling: implications for prostate cancer.', 'Intercellular crosstalk between cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts via extracellular vesicles.', 'Roles of exosomes as drug delivery systems in cancer immunotherapy: a mini-review.', 'Effect of Pre-Processing Storage Condition of Cell Culture-Conditioned Medium on Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.', 'Emerging roles of exosome-derived biomarkers in cancer theranostics: messages from novel protein targets.', 'Mechanisms of coordinating hyaluronan and glycosaminoglycan production by nucleotide sugars.']"""

We describe a new technique of testicular transposition (TT) in patients treated with pulse-dose-rate (PDR) brachytherapy as part of the multimodal conservative treatment of bladder neck and/or prostate rhabdomyosarcoma (BP RMS).  Methods:   Medical records of consecutive patients treated between September 2016 and August 2017 were studied. These patients underwent a TT performed during BP RMS surgery by the same suprapubic incision. The external oblique aponeurosis was not incised. The spermatic cord was mobilized up to the external inguinal ring, and the gubernaculum attachments were severed from the scrotum. The testis was then flipped over with care taken to avoid injury of the vessels or the vas, wrapped in a silicone material and sutured under the abdominal skin with a transfixing stitch facing the anterior superior iliac spine. At the end of brachytherapy, the testis was relocated in the scrotum and during the same general anesthesia, plastic tubes and stents were removed. Surgical outcome and dosimetric parameters were examined.  Results:   Eight patients were identified. Median age was 24 months (range 11-80 months). All had embryonal BP RMS and received chemotherapy according to RMS 2005 protocol prior to local treatment. All patients underwent conservative surgery followed by brachytherapy (60 Gy) and had testicular transposition of one testis. None had surgical complications. After converting doses to biologically equivalent doses in 2-Gy fractions (EQD2), the dose delivered to 75% of the transposed testis was 1.5 GyEQD2 (1-3 GyEQD2), versus 5.4 GyEQD2 (3.9-9.4 Gy EQD2) for the untransposed testis (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Testicular transposition is feasible in order to potentially preserve fertility and future quality of life in children undergoing brachytherapy for BP RMS.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 2897 renal transplants between January 1987 and December 2016. Recipients presenting with de novo urologic malignancies were evaluated. We retrospectively assessed the stage of the disease, treatment performed, and subsequent oncologic outcome. Patients with a history of preexisting cancers were excluded.  Results:   Sixty-one de novo urologic malignancies were recorded in 58 patients. The overall incidence of urologic malignancies was 2.2%. We identified 29 cases of prostate cancer, 23 of renal cell carcinoma, 6 of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, and 1 case of penile carcinoma. No cases of testicular tumors were found. The mean age at tumor diagnosis was 58.7 ± 10.1 years. The median time between renal transplantation and tumor development was 84 months (range, 2-310 months). Fifty-six (96.6%) patients received deceased donor kidneys. The overall survival rate at 5 years after diagnosis of urologic tumor was 82.8%. Tumor-related death was reported in 13.8% of patients. Nineteen (32.8%) patients had graft loss. Of these, 8 patients had no functional graft when the diagnosis of urologic tumor was made.

Development of a lymphocele is a frequent complication after pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) for nodal staging in prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   From 2013 to 2017, 100 patients with prostate cancer who were set to undergo a staging PLND before external beam radiotherapy (n = 50) or PLND concomitant with radical prostatectomy (RP) (n = 50) were prospectively randomized 1:1 between bilateral TachoSil placement or nonplacement. Primary end points were radiographic lymphocele development, lymphocele volume (1 week and 1 month postoperatively), and the duration and volume of postoperative catheter drainage.  Results:   Patient, tumor, and surgical characteristics of the TachoSil and the control groups did not differ significantly. In total, 65 patients (65%) experienced a radiographic lymphocele up to 3 months after surgery: 29 (58%) in the TachoSil group and 36 (72%) in the control group (P = .34). Significantly less radiographic lymphoceles were observed 1 week postoperatively for patients who underwent sole PLND and 1 month postoperatively for patients who underwent PLND with RP in the TachoSil group compared with the control group (16% vs 48%, P = .024, and 24% vs 52%, P = .047, respectively). The other postoperative characteristics presented no significant differences between the 2 groups, neither for patients undergoing sole PLND nor for patients undergoing PLND with RP.

We investigated the stem-cell-related function and biological features of a subpopulation of CD133+ cells isolated from established primary human prostate cancer cell lines. The CD133+ cells sorted from human prostate cancer 22Rv1 exhibited high clonogenic and tumorigenic capabilities, sphere forming capacity and serially reinitiated transplantable tumors in NOD-SCID mice. Gene profiling analysis of CD133+ cells showed upregulation of markers of stem cell differentiation (CD44, Oct4, SOX9 and Nanog), epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (c-myc and BMI1), osteoblastic differentiation (Runx2), and skeletal morphogenesis (BMP2), compared to side population of CD133- cells. These cells are highly malignant and resistant to γ-radiation and chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel. Importantly, a docetaxel-resistant subclone was more enriched in CD133+ cells with significant increase in Runx2 expression, compared to CD133- cells. Furthermore, knockdown of Runx2 in these cells resulted in differential response to chemotherapy, sensitizing them to increased cell death. These results demonstrate therapy-resistant population with stem-like features are distinct subpopulation of malignant cells that resides within parental cell lines.

Clinical practice is continuously challenged by the pitfalls of the available diagnostic tools. microRNAs may represent promising biomarkers in many types of human cancers, including prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate microRNA expression in tumour tissue and matched plasma in a cohort of patients with primary metastatic prostate cancer. The relative expression of 12 microRNAs was assessed in diagnostic needle biopsies from the prostate and matched plasma samples in two prospective cohorts (screening cohorts) comprising 21 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and 25 control patients. An independent validation cohort of plasma samples was collected prospectively from 149 newly diagnosed patients with local/locally advanced prostate cancer. Analyses were performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. miRNA-93 showed a significant negative correlation between expression in tumour tissue and plasma in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Furthermore, the plasma level of miRNA-93 significantly decreased after treatment in patients with local/locally advanced prostate cancer compared to baseline plasma level. The expression of six microRNAs (let-7b, miRNA-34a, -125b, -143, -145 and -221) was downregulated, and three microRNAs (miRNA-21, -25 and miRNA-93) were upregulated in tumour tissue compared to benign prostate tissue. In plasma, six microRNAs were upregulated (miRNA-21, -125b, -126, -141, -143 and -375), while let-7b was downregulated in patients with metastatic prostate cancer compared to the control cohort. In the metastatic prostate cancer cohort, the expression of four microRNAs (miRNA-125b, -126, -143 and -221), and miRNA-141 in tissue was associated with Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen, respectively.

The data were analyzed using a conditional logistic regression model to calculate coefficients and the relative importance (RI) of each attribute. A total of 103 PCa patients and 127 physicians responded. The study looked at 37 patients considered as advanced PCa and 66 who were non-advanced PCa. All of the physicians were urologists. Advanced PCa patients ranked the attributes as follows: treatment effectiveness (RI: 32%), accessibility of treatment (RI: 26%), QOL (RI: 23%), and side effects (RI: 19%). For physicians, the RI ranking was the same as for advanced PCa patients; treatment effectiveness (RI: 29%), accessibility of treatment (RI: 27%), QOL (RI: 26%), and side effects (RI: 18%). For non-advanced PCa patients, accessibility of treatment ranked the highest RI (27%) and treatment effectiveness ranked as the lowest RI (14%).

TT currently has one of the highest CaP mortality rates in the world.  Methods:   6,064 incident and 3,704 mortality cases of CaP occurring in TT from January 1995 to 31 December 2009 reported to the Dr. Elizabeth Quamina Cancer population-based cancer registry for TT, were analyzed to examine CaP survival, incidence, and mortality rates and trends by ancestry and geography.  Results:   The age-standardized CaP incidence and mortality rates (per 100,000) based on the 1960 world-standardized in 2009 were 64.2 and 47.1 per 100,000. The mortality rate in TT increased between 1995 (37.9 per 100,000) and 2009 (79.4 per 100,000), while the rate in the US decreased from 37.3 per 100,000 to 22.1 per 100,000 over the same period. Fewer African ancestry patients received treatment relative to those of Indian and mixed ancestry (45.7%, 60.3%, and 60.9%, respectively).

Using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and genome-wide RNA sequencing, we have analyzed androgen concentrations and androgen-regulated gene expression in cancerous and morphologically benign prostate tissue specimens and serum samples obtained from 48 primary prostate cancer patients. Intratumoral dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentrations were significantly higher in the cancerous tissues compared to benign prostate (P < 0.001). The tissue/serum ratios of androgens were highly variable between the patients, indicating individual patterns of androgen metabolism and/or uptake of androgens within the prostate tissue. An unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of intratissue androgen concentrations indicated that transmembrane protease, serine 2/ETS-related gene (TMPRSS2-ERG)-positive patients have different androgen profiles compared to TMPRSS2-ERG-negative patients. TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion status was also associated with an enhanced androgen-regulated gene expression, along with altered intratumoral androgen metabolism, demonstrated by reduced testosterone concentrations and increased DHT/testosterone ratios in TMPRSS2-ERG-positive tumors. TMPRSS2-ERG-positive and -negative prostate cancer specimens have distinct intratumoral androgen profiles, possibly due to activation of testosterone-independent DHT biosynthesis via the alternative pathway in TMPRSS2-ERG-positive tumors. Thus, patients with TMPRSS2-ERG-positive prostate cancer may benefit from novel inhibitors targeting the alternative DHT biosynthesis.""","""['Matias Knuuttila', 'Arfa Mehmood', 'Jenni Mäki-Jouppila', 'Henrik Ryberg', 'Pekka Taimen', 'Juha Knaapila', 'Otto Ettala', 'Peter J Boström', 'Claes Ohlsson', 'Mikko S Venäläinen', 'Asta Laiho', 'Laura L Elo', 'Petra Sipilä', 'Sari I Mäkelä', 'Matti Poutanen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['TMPRSS2:ERG fusion by translocation or interstitial deletion is highly relevant in androgen-dependent prostate cancer, but is bypassed in late-stage androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer.', 'TMPRSS2/ERG fusion gene expression alters chemo- and radio-responsiveness in cell culture models of androgen independent prostate cancer.', 'ERG/AKR1C3/AR Constitutes a Feed-Forward Loop for AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Covid-19 pathogenesis in prostatic cancer and TMPRSS2-ERG regulatory genetic pathway.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'The variant rs77559646 associated with aggressive prostate cancer disrupts ANO7 mRNA splicing and protein expression.', 'Macrophage-Derived Cholesterol Contributes to Therapeutic Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Comprehensive analysis of oncogenic signatures and consequent repurposed drugs in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive prostate cancer.', 'SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Cardioncology: From Cardiometabolic Risk Factors to Outcomes in Cancer Patients.', 'SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Lung Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Modalities.']"""

We compared genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity after post-prostatectomy IMRT or 3D-CRT.  Materials and methods:   A population-based study of all patients treated with post-prostatectomy 3D-CRT (n = 2422) and IMRT (n = 603) was conducted between January 1 2010 and December 31 2013 in the English National Health Service. We identified severe GI and GU toxicity using a validated coding-framework and compared IMRT and 3D-CRT using a competing-risks proportional hazards regression analysis.  Results:   There was no difference in GI toxicity between patients who received IMRT and 3D-CRT (3D-CRT: 5.8 events/100 person-years; IMRT: 5.5 events/100 person-years; adjusted HR: 0.85, 95%CI: 0.63-1.13; p = 0.26). The GU toxicity rate was lower with IMRT but this effect was not statistically significant (3D-CRT: 5.4 events/100 person-years; IMRT: 3.8 events/100 person-years; adjusted HR: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.55-1.03; p = 0.08).  Conclusions:   The use of post-prostatectomy IMRT compared to 3D-CRT is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in rates of severe GU and GI toxicity, although there is some evidence that GU toxicity is lower with IMRT.

Patients and methods:   The study was conducted on 752 patients treated from April 2009 to February 2017. Patients received 42.4 Gy in 16 daily fractions (2.65 Gy per fraction). A boost was only administered in cases of grade 3 primary tumor and close or positive margins. Acute and late toxicity was prospectively assessed during and after hypo-RT, based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. DFS and local recurrence-free survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method for cumulative probability. Log-rank tests were used to identify differences by subtype. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the impact of various factors on the risk of disease progression.  Results:   Among the 752 patients treated, 41 (5.5%) experienced disease progression, including 7 (17.1%) exclusively local recurrences; 1 (2.4%) local and nodal recurrence; 1 (2.4%) local and nodal recurrence plus metastasis; 7 (17.1%) nodal recurrences plus metastases; and 25 (61%) exclusively distant metastases. The 5-year DFS, local recurrence-free survival, breast cancer-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 88.6-94.2), 98.0% (95% CI, 96.1-99.1), 98.2% (95% CI, 96.5-99.1), and 87.5% (95% CI, 83.8-90.5), respectively.

Evidence from basic science suggests that cadmium can bind to the androgen receptor causing endocrine disruption. The androgen receptor is required for normal prostate development and is the key driver of prostate cancer progression. In this study, we examined the association between cadmium content and androgen receptor protein expression in prostate cancer tissue of African American (N = 22) and European American (N = 30) men. Although neither overall tumor cadmium content (log transformed) nor androgen receptor protein expression level differed by race, we observed a race-cadmium interaction with regard to androgen receptor expression (P = 0.003) even after accounting for age at prostatectomy, smoking history, and Gleason score. African American men had a significant positive correlation between tumor tissue cadmium content and androgen receptor expression (Pearson correlation = 0.52, P = 0.013), while European Americans showed a non-significant negative correlation between the two (Pearson correlation = -0.19, P = 0.31). These results were unchanged after further accounting for tissue zinc content or dietary zinc or selenium intake. African American cases with high-cadmium content (>median) in tumor tissue had more than double the androgen receptor expression (0.021 vs. 0.008, P = 0.014) of African American men with low-cadmium level. No difference in androgen receptor expression was observed in European Americans by cadmium level (high 0.015 vs. low 0.011, P = 0.30). Larger studies are needed to confirm these results and if upheld, determine the biologic mechanism by which cadmium increases androgen receptor protein expression in a race-dependent manner.

Methods The expression of miR-151a-3p in PC-3M, C4-2B, 22RV1, DU-145, PC-3, LNCap human prostate cancer cells and RWPE-1 human normal prostate epithelial cells was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. PC-3 cells with the lowest expression of miR-151a-3p were used for subsequent experiments. Bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter assay were performed to predict and test potential target genes of miR-151a-3p. The miR-151a-3p mimics or negative control microRNAs (miR-NCs) were transfected into PC-3 cells. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-151a-3p and potential target gene mRNA. The protein expressions of target genes and downstream signaling pathway proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. The proliferation of PC-3 cells was examined by MTT assay, and the migration of PC-3 cells was detected by TranswellTM assay. Results The expression level of miR-151a-3p in the prostate cancer cells was significantly lower than that in RWPE-1 normal human prostate epithelial cells. PC-3 cells had the lowest expression level of miR-151a-3p. The bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that NEK2 was the potential target gene for miR-151a-3p. After transfection with miR-151a-3p mimics, the expression of miR-151a-3p in PC-3 cells significantly increased and the expression of NEK2 mRNA significantly decreased. The protein expressions of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway were also reduced. Up-regulation of miR-151a-3p significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of PC-3 cells. Conclusion The expression of miR-151a-3p is reduced in prostate cancer cells.

Methods:   PC3 cells were treated with HVJ-E at various multiplicity of infection (MOI), and the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell viability, apoptosis, and autophagy were detected, respectively. Next, the role of ROS played in the regulation of HVJ-E-induced apoptosis and autuphagy in PC3 cells were analysed. In the end, the relationship between HVJ-E-induced apoptosis and autuophagy was investigated by using rapamycin and chloroquine.  Results:   Flow cytometry assay revealed that HVJ-E treatment induced dose-dependent apoptosis and that the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways were involved in HVJ-E-induced apoptosis in PC3 cells. In addition, HVJ-E was able to induce autophagy in PC3 cells via the class III PI3K/beclin-1 pathway. The data also implyed that HVJ-E-triggered autophagy and apoptosis were ROS dependent. When ROS was blocked with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), HVJ-E-induced LC3-II conversion and apoptosis were reversed.

The geocoded control group was a random sample of 10 controls per case matched by frequency of age and sex. To assess case clusters, differences in Ripley K functions between cases and controls were calculated. The spatial location of clusters was explored by investigating spatial intensity and its ratio between cases and controls. Results suggest the existence of an aggregation of cancers with a common risk factor such as tobacco smoking (lung, bladder and kidney cancers).

Recently, we have shown that KDM2B regulates actin cytoskeleton organization, small Rho GTPases signaling, cell-cell adhesion and migration of prostate tumor cells. In the present study, we addressed its role in regulating EMT and small GTPases expression in colon tumor cells.  Methods:   We used RT-PCR for the transcriptional analysis of various genes, Western blotting for the assessment of protein expression and immunofluorescence microscopy for visualization of fluorescently labeled proteins.  Results:   We report here that KDM2B regulates EZH2 and BMI1 in HCT116 colon tumor cells. Knockdown of this epigenetic factor induced potent up-regulation of the protein levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and ZO-1, while the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin was downregulated. On the other hand, KDM2B overexpression downregulated the levels of both epithelial markers and upregulated the mesenchymal marker, suggesting control of EMT by KDM2B. In addition, RhoA, RhoB and RhoC protein levels diminished upon KDM2B-knockdown, while all three small GTPases became upregulated in KDM2B-overexpressing HCT116 cell clones. Interestingly, Rac1 GTPase level increased upon KDM2B-knockdown and diminished in KDM2B-overexpressing HCT116 colon tumor- and DU-145 prostate cancer cells.

Misclassification was defined as non-organ confined or grade group ≥3 disease at RP. The coefficients of a logistic regression model predicting misclassification were used to develop a risk score. We then performed a systematic analysis of different thresholds to discriminate between patients with or without unfavourable disease and we compared it to available AS criteria.

The feasibility of incorporating volume variation metric thresholds predictive of delivering planned dose into weighted functions, was investigated.  Methods:   Radiation therapists and radiation oncologists participated in workshops where they reviewed prostate CBCT-IGRT case examples and completed a paper-based survey of image feature matching practices. For 36 prostate cancer patients, one daily CBCT was retrospectively contoured then registered with their plan to simulate delivered dose if (a) no online setup corrections and (b) online image alignment and setup corrections, were performed. Survey results were used to select variables for inclusion in classification and regression tree (CART) and boosted regression trees (BRT) modeling of volume variation metric thresholds predictive of delivering planned dose to the prostate, proximal seminal vesicles (PSV), bladder, and rectum. Weighted functions incorporating the CART and BRT results were used to calculate a score of individual tumor and organ at risk image feature alignment (FASTV_OAR ). Scaled and weighted FASTV_OAR were then used to calculate a score of overall treatment compliance (FASglobal ) for a given CBCT-planning CT registration. The FASTV_OAR were assessed for sensitivity, specificity, and predictive power. FASglobal thresholds indicative of high, medium, or low overall treatment plan compliance were determined using coefficients from multiple linear regression analysis.  Results:   Thirty-two participants completed the prostate CBCT-IGRT survey. While responses demonstrated consensus of practice for preferential ranking of planning CT and CBCT match features in the presence of deformation and rotation, variation existed in the specified thresholds for observed volume differences requiring patient repositioning or repeat bladder and bowel preparation. The CART and BRT modeling indicated that for a given registration, a Dice similarity coefficient >0.80 and >0.60 for the prostate and PSV, respectively, and a maximum Hausdorff distance <8.0 mm for both structures were predictive of delivered dose ± 5% of planned dose. A normalized volume difference <1.0 and a CBCT anterior rectum wall >1.0 mm anterior to the planning CT anterior rectum wall were predictive of delivered dose >5% of planned rectum dose. A normalized volume difference <0.88, and a CBCT bladder wall >13.5 mm inferior and >5.0 mm posterior to the planning CT bladder were predictive of delivered dose >5% of planned bladder dose. A FASTV_OAR >0 is indicative of delivery of planned dose. For calculated FASTV_OAR for the prostate, PSV, bladder, and rectum using test data, sensitivity was 0.56, 0.75, 0.89, and 1.00, respectively; specificity 0.90, 0.94, 0.59, and 1.00, respectively; positive predictive power 0.90, 0.86, 0.53, and 1.00, respectively; and negative predictive power 0.56, 0.89, 0.91, and 1.00, respectively. Thresholds for the calculated FASglobal of were low <60, medium 60-80, and high >80, with a 27% misclassification rate for the test data.  Conclusions:   A FASglobal incorporating nested FASTV_OAR and volume variation metric thresholds predictive of treatment plan compliance was developed, offering an alternative to pretreatment dose calculations to assess treatment delivery accuracy.""","""['Catriona Hargrave', 'Timothy Deegan', 'Michael Poulsen', 'Tomasz Bednarz', 'Fiona Harden', 'Kerrie Mengersen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['An image-guided radiotherapy decision support framework incorporating a Bayesian network and visualization tool.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'A novel approach for evaluation of prostate deformation and associated dosimetric implications in IGRT of the prostate.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Feasibility evaluation of kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography dose calculation following scatter correction: investigations of phantom and representative tumor sites.']"""

To reduce the scale of computation and improve characterization of isodose plan, this paper presents an isodose feature-preserving voxelization (IFPV) framework for radiation therapy applications and demonstrates an implementation of inverse planning in the IFPV domain.  Methods:   A dose distribution in IFPV scheme is characterized by partitioning the voxels into subgroups according to their geometric and dosimetric values. Computationally, the isodose feature-preserving (IFP) clustering combines the conventional voxels that are spatially and dosimetrically close into physically meaningful clusters. A K-means algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) runs sequentially to group the voxels into IFP clusters. The former generates initial clusters according to the geometric and dosimetric information of the voxels and SVM is invoked to improve the connectivity of the IFP clusters. To illustrate the utility of the formalism, an inverse planning framework in the IFPV domain is implemented, and the resultant plans of three prostate IMRT and one head-and-neck cases are compared quantitatively with that obtained using conventional inverse planning technique.  Results:   The IFPV generates models with significant dimensionality reduction without compromising the spatial resolution seen in traditional downsampling schemes. The implementation of inverse planning in IFPV domain is demonstrated. In addition to the improved computational efficiency, it is found that, for the cases studied here, the IFPV-domain inverse planning yields better treatment plans than that of DVH-based planning, primarily because of more effective use of both geometric and dose information of the system during plan optimization.  Conclusions:   The proposed IFPV provides a low parametric representation of isodose plan without compromising the essential characteristics of the plan, thus providing a practically valuable framework for various applications in radiation therapy.""","""['Hongcheng Liu', 'Lei Xing']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Dose distribution prediction in isodose feature-preserving voxelization domain using deep convolutional neural network.', 'Using measurable dosimetric quantities to characterize the inter-structural tradeoff in inverse planning.', 'Toward truly optimal IMRT dose distribution: inverse planning with voxel-specific penalty.', ""Practical aspects of inverse-planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a radiation treatment planner's perspective."", 'Paradigm Shift in Radiation Treatment Planning Over Multiple Treatment Modalities.']"""

Methods:   The BN was created to represent relationships between observed prostate, proximal seminal vesicle (PSV), bladder and rectum volume variations, an image feature alignment score (FASTV_OAR ), delivered dose, and treatment plan compliance (TPC). Variables influencing tumor volume (TV) targeting accuracy such as intrafraction motion, and contouring and couch shift errors were also represented. A score of overall TPC (FASglobal ) and factors such as image quality were used to inform the BN output node providing advice about proceeding with treatment. The BN was quantified using conditional probabilities generated from published studies, FASTV_OAR/global modeling, and a survey of IGRT decision-making practices. A new IGRT visualization tool (IGRTREV ), in the form of Mollweide projection plots, was developed to provide a global summary of residual errors after online CBCT-planning CT registration. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were undertaken to evaluate the performance of the BN and the relative influence of the network variables on TPC and the decision to proceed with treatment. The IGRTREV plots were evaluated in conjunction with the BN scenario testing, using additional test data generated from retrospective CBCT-planning CT soft-tissue registrations for 13/36 patients whose data were used in the FASTV_OAR/global modeling.  Results:   Modeling of the TV targeting errors resulted in a very low probability of corrected distances between the CBCT and planning CT prostate or PSV volumes being within their thresholds. Strength of influence evaluation with and without the BN TV targeting error nodes indicated that rectum- and bladder-related network variables had the highest relative importance. When the TV targeting error nodes were excluded from the BN, TPC was sensitive to observed PSV and rectum variations while the decision to treat was sensitive to observed prostate and PSV variations. When root nodes were set so the PSV and rectum variations exceeded thresholds, the probability of low TPC increased to 40%. Prostate and PSV variations exceeding thresholds increased the likelihood of repositioning or repeating patient preparation to 43%. Scenario testing using the test data from 13 patients, demonstrated two cases where the BN provided increased high TPC probabilities, despite some of the prostate and PSV volume variation metrics not being within tolerance. The IGRTREV tool was effective in highlighting and quantifying where TV and OAR variations occurred, supporting the BN recommendation to reposition the patient or repeat their bladder and bowel preparation. In another case, the IGRTREV tool was also effective in highlighting where PSV volume variation significantly exceeded tolerance when the BN had indicated to proceed with treatment.  Conclusions:   This study has demonstrated that both the BN and IGRTREV plots are effective tools for inclusion in a decision support system for online CBCT-based IGRT for prostate cancer patients. Alternate approaches to modeling TV targeting errors need to be explored as well as extension of the BN to support offline IGRT decisions related to adaptive radiotherapy.""","""['Catriona Hargrave', 'Timothy Deegan', 'Tomasz Bednarz', 'Michael Poulsen', 'Fiona Harden', 'Kerrie Mengersen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A feature alignment score for online cone-beam CT-based image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Inter- and intrafraction uncertainty in prostate bed image-guided radiotherapy.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'The implementation of MOSAIQ-based image-guided radiation therapy image matching within radiation therapy education.', 'A decision support system for assessing management interventions in a mental health ecosystem: The case of Bizkaia (Basque Country, Spain).']"""

Unfortunately, despite use of radiological/serological screening techniques, HCC ranks as a leading cause of cancer deaths. Our group has used alterations in high order chromatin as a marker for field carcinogenesis and hence risk for a variety of cancers (including colon, lung, prostate, ovarian, esophageal). In this study we wanted to address whether these chromatin alterations occur in HCC and if it could be used for risk stratification.  Experimental design:   A case control study was performed in patients with cirrhosis who went on to develop HCC and patients with cirrhosis who did not develop cancer. We performed partial wave spectroscopic microscopy (PWS) which measures nanoscale alterations on formalin fixed deparaffinized liver biopsy specimens, 17 progressors and 26 non-progressors. Follow up was 2089 and 2892 days, respectively.  Results:   PWS parameter disorder strength Ld were notably higher for the progressors (Ld = 1.47 ± 0.76) than the non-progressors (Ld = 1.00 ± 0.27) (p = 0.024). Overall, the Cohen's d effect size was 0.907 (90.7%). AUROC analysis yielded an area of 0.70. There was no evidence of confounding by gender, age, BMI, smoking status and race.

Using the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM), we examined the interpersonal process model of intimacy, which proposes associations between self- and perceived partner disclosure about cancer and perceived partner responsiveness as predictors of global relationship intimacy. The study's outcomes were patients' and spouses' ratings of global relationship intimacy. Both actor (my disclosure predicts my intimacy) and partner (my partner's disclosure predicts my intimacy) effects were examined, as well as possible moderating effects for cancer-related concerns. Two hundred and nine couples in which one or both partners reported elevated cancer-specific distress completed measures of self- and perceived partner disclosure and perceived partner responsiveness regarding discussions about prostate cancer, global relational intimacy, and cancer-related concerns. Results were consistent with the interpersonal process model of intimacy in that perceived responsiveness mediated the association between self- and perceived partner disclosure about cancer and global relational intimacy for both patients and spouses. Results also indicated moderation of the links between disclosure and relational intimacy by level of patient cancer-related concerns such that the links were stronger when concerns were higher. Finally, there was also evidence of moderated mediation such that indirect effects of disclosure on relational intimacy via perceived partner responsiveness were stronger when concerns were higher. Interventions for distressed couples coping with prostate cancer would benefit from focusing on facilitating disclosure and responsiveness, particularly among distressed couples who report cancer concerns.

Patients and methods:   A total of 38 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in our hospital from June 2013 to June 2016 were divided into paclitaxel-resistant group (n=19) and non-resistant group (n=19) according to the follow-up treatment effects. Fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to evaluate the levels of PER3 in drug-resistant and non-resistant groups as well as the relative levels of PER3 before and after treatment. PER3 was overexpressed or knocked down in a paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell line, followed by measuring its IC50 as well as changes in cell cycle and apoptosis. Using Western blot, we detected downregulation of Notch pathway and related receptor proteins when PER3 was overexpressed.  Results:   The results of fluorescence quantitative PCR showed that the expression of PER3 in the paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer group was lower than that in the non-resistant group, and the relative expression of PER3 was decreased after treatment. Fluorescent quantitative PCR and Western blot showed that the expression of PER3 in paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells was higher than that of the untreated counterparts. After overexpression of PER3 by transfecting prostate cancer-resistant cell lines with plasmids, the IC50 was significantly reduced, the cell cycle was arrested, and the apoptosis was significantly increased. Subsequently, we detected decreased expression of Notch1 in PER3 over-expressed paclitaxel-resistant cell lines by Western blot; this attenuated resistance in paclitaxel-resistant cell lines.

Oncological safety of laparoscopic resection of T4 tumours is controversial. However, robot-assisted resections might have advantages, such as 3D view and greater range of motion of instruments. The aim of this study is to evaluate the initial results of robot-assisted resection of T4 rectal and distal sigmoid tumours.  Methods:   This is a cohort study of a prospectively kept database of all robot-assisted rectal and sigmoid resections between 2012 and 2017. Patients who underwent a multivisceral resection for tumours appearing as T4 cancer during surgery were included. Rectal and sigmoid resections are routinely performed with the DaVinci robot, unless an indication for intra-operative radiotherapy exists.  Results:   28 patients with suspected T4 rectal or sigmoid cancer were included. Most patients (78%) were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (n = 19), short course radiotherapy with long waiting interval (n = 2) or chemotherapy (n = 1). En bloc resection was performed with the complete or part of the invaded organ (prostate, vesicles, bladder, abdominal wall, presacral fascia, vagina, uterus, adnex). In 3 patients (11%), the procedure was converted to laparotomy. Twenty-four R0-resections were performed (86%) and four R1-resections (14%). Median length of surgery was 274 min (IQR 222-354). Median length of stay was 6 days (IQR 5-11). Twelve patients (43%) had postoperative complications: eight (29%) minor complications and four (14%) major complications. There was no postoperative mortality.  Conclusions:   Robot-assisted laparoscopy seems to be a feasible option for the resection of clinical T4 cancer of the distal sigmoid and rectum in selected cases. Radical resections can be achieved in the majority of cases.

Phase I/II trial of curcumin alone or with chemotherapeutic drugs has been accomplished in pancreatic, colon, prostate and breast cancer cases. Recently, autocrine growth hormone (GH) signaling-induced cell growth, metastasis and drug resistance have been demonstrated in breast cancer. In this study, our aim was to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of curcumin by evaluating the molecular machinery of curcumin-triggered apoptotic cell death via focusing on NF-κB signaling and polyamine (PA) metabolism in autocrine GH-expressing MCF-7, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. For this purpose, a pcDNA3.1 (+) vector with a GH gene insert was transfected by a liposomal agent in all breast cancer cells and then selection was conducted in neomycin (G418) included media. Autocrine GH-induced curcumin resistance was overcome in a dose-dependent manner and curcumin inhibited cell proliferation, invasion-metastasis and phosphorylation of p65 (Ser536), and thereby partly prevented its DNA binding activity in breast cancer cells. Moreover, curcumin induced caspase-mediated apoptotic cell death by activating the PA catabolic enzyme expressions, which led to generation of toxic by-products such as H2O2 in MCF-7, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-231 GH+ breast cancer cells. In addition, transient silencing of SSAT prevented curcumin-induced cell viability loss and apoptotic cell death in each breast cancer cells.

Using a 3D co-culture system, we here show that Raw 264.7 macrophages increased cell proliferation of normal prostate epithelial PZ-HPV-7 cells. In addition, these Raw 264.7 macrophages expressed higher levels of Ym1 and CD206. We further identify macrophage-secreted cytokines including CCL3, IL-1ra, osteopontin, M-CSF1 and GDNF as mediators for potentiating PZ-HPV-7 cell proliferation in 3D. All these cytokines differentially activated ERK and Akt. Blockade of both kinases through their inhibitors hindered macrophage-induced cell proliferation of PZ-HPV-7 cells.

Among the top positive hits, we conducted an in-depth functional analysis on Pygopus family PHD finger 2 (PYGO2), located in the amplicon at 1q21.3.

Conversely, PYGO2 depletion inhibits prostate cancer cell invasion in vitro and progression of primary tumor and metastasis in vivo In clinical samples, PYGO2 upregulation associated with higher Gleason score and metastasis to lymph nodes and bone. Silencing PYGO2 expression in patient-derived xenograft models impairs tumor progression. Finally, PYGO2 is necessary to enhance the transcriptional activation in response to ligand-induced Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Methods: 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT scans of 739 PC patients available in our database were evaluated retrospectively for lung metastases and non-solid focal pulmonary opacities. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were assessed by two- and three-dimensional regions of interest (2D/3D ROI). Additionally CT features of the lesions, such as location, morphology and size were identified.  Results:   Ninety-one pulmonary metastases and fourteen opacities were identified in 34 PC patients. In total, 66 PSMA-positive (72.5%) and 25 PSMA-negative (27.5%) metastases were identified. The mean SUVmax of pulmonary opacities was 2.2±0.7 in 2D ROI and 2.4±0.8 in 3D ROI. The mean SUVmax of PSMA-positive pulmonary metastases was 4.5±2.7 in 2D ROI and in 4.7±2.9 in 3D ROI; this was significantly higher than the SUVmax of pulmonary opacities in both 2D and 3D ROI (p<0.001). The mean SUVmax of PSMA-negative metastases was 1.0±0.5 in 2D ROI and 1.0±0.4 in 3D ROI, and significantly lower than that of the pulmonary opacities (p<0.001). A significant (p<0.05) weak linear correlation between size and 3D SUVmax in lung metastases (ρSpearman=0.207) was found.  Conclusion:   Based on the SUVmax in 68Ga-PSMA-PET alone, it was not possible to differentiate between pulmonary metastases and pulmonary opacities.

While most cancer detection algorithms utilize either voxel-based or region-based feature models, the complexity of prostate tumour phenotype in MP-MRI requires a more sophisticated framework to better leverage available data and exploit a priori knowledge in the field.  Methods:   In this paper, we present MPCaD, a novel Multi-scale radiomics-driven framework for Prostate Cancer Detection and localization which leverages radiomic feature models at different scales as well as incorporates a priori knowledge of the field. Tumour candidate localization is first performed using a statistical texture distinctiveness strategy that leverages a voxel-resolution feature model to localize tumour candidate regions. Tumour region classification via a region-resolution feature model is then performed to identify tumour regions. Both voxel-resolution and region-resolution feature models are built upon and extracted from six different MP-MRI modalities. Finally, a conditional random field framework that is driven by voxel-resolution relative ADC features is used to further refine the localization of the tumour regions in the peripheral zone to improve the accuracy of the results.  Results:   The proposed framework is evaluated using clinical prostate MP-MRI data from 30 patients, and results demonstrate that the proposed framework exhibits enhanced separability of cancerous and healthy tissue, as well as outperforms individual quantitative radiomics models for prostate cancer detection.

However, the efficacy of this combination for the treatment of gastric cancer, and potential predictive therapeutic biomarkers remain unclear. Recent evidence suggests that the deficiency of AT-rich interactive domain containing protein 1A (ARID1A), which is a crucial chromatin remodeling gene, sensitizes tumor cells to PI3K and PARP inhibitors. Herein, we evaluated the therapeutic role of the combined treatment of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and PARP inhibitor olaparib on gastric cancer cells, and explored ARID1A as a predictive biomarker. The results demonstrated that combined treatment with PI3K and PARP inhibitors effectively inhibited proliferation detected by MTS and clonogenic assay, invasion and migration by Transwell assay, of gastric cancer cells with ARID1A deficiency.

In the present study, a pentapeptide (Ile‑Leu‑Tyr‑Met‑Pro; ILYMP) with a molecular weight of 635.71 Da was isolated from the protein hydrolysate of Cyclina sinensis via ultrafiltration and chromatographic methods, and subsequently named Cyclina sinensis pentapeptide (CSP). The activity of CSP was first investigated in prostate cancer (PCa) DU‑145 cells. CSP was demonstrated to significantly inhibit DU‑145 cell proliferation at a half‑maximal inhibitory concentration of 11.25 mM at a 72 h time interval. In addition, the results of acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining, scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry analyses suggested that CSP inhibited DU‑145 cell proliferation via the induction of apoptosis. Following treatment with CSP, Bcl‑2‑associated X (Bax), cleaved caspase‑3 and cleaved caspase‑9 protein expression levels were enhanced in DU‑145 cells; whereas B‑cell lymphoma 2 expression was suppressed in DU‑145 cells. In conclusion, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of an anti‑proliferative peptide derived from Cyclina sinensis on DU‑145 cells, and the results suggested that CSP may represent a therapeutic nutraceutical agent for the treatment of patients with PCa.""","""['Fangmiao Yu', 'Yaru Zhang', 'Lei Ye', 'Yunping Tang', 'Guofang Ding', 'Xiaojun Zhang', 'Zuisu Yang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Anticancer Activity of a Hexapeptide from Skate (Raja porosa) Cartilage Protein Hydrolysate in HeLa Cells.', 'Anticancer Activity of Anthopleura anjunae Oligopeptides in Prostate Cancer DU-145 Cells.', 'Synthesis and antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activity of novel 3-substituted-3-hydroxy-2-oxindole compounds.', 'Growth of human prostate cancer cells is significantly suppressed in vitro with sodium butyrate through apoptosis.', 'Diosgenin‑induced autophagy and apoptosis in a human prostate cancer cell line.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Marine Peptides in Prostate Cancer: Mechanistic Insights.', 'Recent Advances in Small Peptides of Marine Origin in Cancer Therapy.', 'Immunomodulatory Effects of the Meretrix Meretrix Oligopeptide (QLNWD) on Immune-Deficient Mice.', 'A Potential Antineoplastic Peptide of Human Prostate Cancer Cells Derived from the Lesser Spotted Dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula L.).', 'Anti-Proliferation Activity of a Decapeptide from Perinereies aibuhitensis toward Human Lung Cancer H1299 Cells.']"""

Therefore, they largely ignore the differences between the two domains, such as the smaller degree of variability in the shape and appearance of the target volume and the smaller amounts of training data in medical applications. We propose a CNN-based method for prostate segmentation in MRI that employs statistical shape models to address these issues.  Methods:   Our CNN predicts the location of the prostate center and the parameters of the shape model, which determine the position of prostate surface keypoints. To train such a large model for segmentation of 3D images using small data (1) we adopt a stage-wise training strategy by first training the network to predict the prostate center and subsequently adding modules for predicting the parameters of the shape model and prostate rotation, (2) we propose a data augmentation method whereby the training images and their prostate surface keypoints are deformed according to the displacements computed based on the shape model, and (3) we employ various regularization techniques.  Results:   Our proposed method achieves a Dice score of 0.88, which is obtained by using both elastic-net and spectral dropout for regularization. Compared with a standard CNN-based method, our method shows significantly better segmentation performance on the prostate base and apex. Our experiments also show that data augmentation using the shape model significantly improves the segmentation results.  Conclusions:   Prior knowledge about the shape of the target organ can improve the performance of CNN-based segmentation methods, especially where image features are not sufficient for a precise segmentation. Statistical shape models can also be employed to synthesize additional training data that can ease the training of large CNNs.""","""['Davood Karimi', 'Golnoosh Samei', 'Claudia Kesch', 'Guy Nir', 'Septimiu E Salcudean']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Combined Transfer Learning and Test-Time Augmentation Improves Convolutional Neural Network-Based Semantic Segmentation of Prostate Cancer from Multi-Parametric MR Images.', 'Accurate and robust deep learning-based segmentation of the prostate clinical target volume in ultrasound images.', 'A novel registration-based algorithm for prostate segmentation via the combination of SSM and CNN.', 'Review on Deep Learning Methodologies in Medical Image Restoration and Segmentation.', 'Bridging 2D and 3D segmentation networks for computation-efficient volumetric medical image segmentation: An empirical study of 2.5D solutions.', 'A novel image augmentation based on statistical shape and intensity models: application to the segmentation of hip bones from CT images.', 'The Evidence for Using Artificial Intelligence to Enhance Prostate Cancer MR Imaging.', 'Learning to segment fetal brain tissue from noisy annotations.', 'Semi-Automatic Prostate Segmentation From Ultrasound Images Using Machine Learning and Principal Curve Based on Interpretable Mathematical Model Expression.', 'Medical Image Segmentation Using Transformer Networks.']"""

However, the prognostic value of PSMs in prostate cancer (PCa) patients who underwent radical prostatectomy remains unclear. Herein, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the association between PSMs and the prognostic value for biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and overall mortality (OM) in PCa patients.  Materials and methods:   According to the PRISMA statement, online databases PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched to identify relevant studies published prior to February 2018. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to evaluate the relationship between PSMs and PCa.  Results:   Ultimately, 32 cohort studies that met the eligibility criteria and involved 141,222 patients (51-65,633 per study) were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that PSMs were significantly predictive of poorer BRFS (HR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.28-1.48, p < 0.001), CSS (HR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.16-1.90, p = 0.001) and OS (HR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20, p = 0.014). In addition, PSMs were significantly associated with higher risk of CSM (HR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.16-1.30, p < 0.001) and OM (HR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.16, p = 0.009) in patients with PCa.

Methods:   Sixteen metastatic PC patients with known skeletal metastases, who underwent both 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 18F-NaF PET/CT for assessment of metastatic burden prior to radionuclide therapy, were analysed retrospectively. The performance of both tracers was calculated on a lesion-based comparison. Intensity of tracer accumulation of pathologic bone lesions on 18F-NaF PET and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was measured with maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and compared to background activity of normal bone. In addition, SUVmax values of PET-positive bone lesions were analysed with respect to morphologic characteristics on CT. Bone metastases were either confirmed by CT or follow-up PET scan.  Results:   In contrast to 468 PET-positive lesions suggestive of bone metastases on 18F-NaF PET, only 351 of the lesions were also judged positive on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (75.0%). Intensity of tracer accumulation of pathologic skeletal lesions was significantly higher on 18F-NaF PET compared to 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, showing a median SUVmax of 27.0 and 6.0, respectively (p < 0.001). Background activity of normal bone was lower on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, with a median SUVmax of 1.0 in comparison to 2.7 on 18F-NaF PET; however, tumour to background ratio was significantly higher on 18F-NaF PET (9.8 versus 5.9 on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET; p = 0.042). Based on morphologic lesion characterisation on CT, 18F-NaF PET revealed median SUVmax values of 23.6 for osteosclerotic, 35.0 for osteolytic, and 19.0 for lesions not visible on CT, whereas on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET median SUVmax values of 5.0 in osteosclerotic, 29.5 in osteolytic, and 7.5 in lesions not seen on CT were measured. Intensity of tracer accumulation between18F-NaF PET and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was significantly higher in osteosclerotic (p < 0.001) and lesions not visible on CT (p = 0.012).  Conclusion:   In comparison to 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, 18F-NaF PET/CT detects a higher number of pathologic bone lesions in advanced stage PC patients scheduled for radionuclide therapy.

While Ad5 can be robust, species C Ad6 has lower seroprevalence, side effects, and appears to be more potent as a systemic therapy against a number of tumors than Ad5. Historically, there have only been four species C human adenoviruses: serotypes 1, 2, 5, and 6. More recently a new species C adenovirus, Ad57, was identified. Ad57 is most similar to Ad6 with virtually all variation in their capsid proteins occurring in the hypervariable regions (HVRs) of their hexon proteins. Most adenovirus neutralizing antibodies target the HVRs on adenoviruses. This led us to replace the hexon HVRs in Ad6 with those from Ad57 to create a new virus called Ad657 and explore this novel species C platform's utility as an oncolytic virus.  Methods:   The HVR region from Ad57 was synthesized and used to replace the Ad6 HVR region by homologous recombination in bacteria generating a new viral platform that we call Ad657. Replication-competent Ad5, Ad6, and Ad657 were compared in vitro and in vivo for liver damage and oncolytic efficacy against prostate cancers after single intravenous treatment in mice.  Results:   Ad5, Ad6, and Ad657 had similar in vitro oncolytic activity against human prostate cancer cells. Ad5 provoked the highest level of liver toxicity after intravenous injection and Ad657 caused the least damage in mice. Previous data demonstrated that Ad6 was superior to Ad5 at killing distant subcutaneous prostate cancer tumors in mouse models after a intravenous injection. Given this, Ad657 was compared to the Ad6 benchmark virus by single intravenous injection into mice bearing subcutaneous human DU145 prostate cancers. Under these conditions, Ad657 first infected the liver and then reached distant tumors. Both Ad6 and Ad657 mediated significant delays in tumor growth and extension of survival with Ad6 mediating higher efficacy.  Conclusions:   These data suggest that Ad657 may have utility as a local or systemic oncolytic virotherapy for prostate cancers.

Materials and methods:   The antiproliferative activity of koenimbin was examined using MTT, and the apoptotic detection was carried out by acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) double-staining and multiparametric high-content screening (HCS) assays. Caspase bioluminescence assay, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and immunoblotting were conducted to confirm the expression of apoptotic-associated proteins. Cell cycle analysis was investigated using flow cytometry. Involvement of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was analyzed using HCS assay. Aldefluor™ and prostasphere formation examinations were used to evaluate the impact of koenimbin on PC-3 CSCs in vitro.  Results:   Koenimbin remarkably inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Koenimbin induced nuclear condensation, formation of apoptotic bodies, and G0/G1 phase arrest of PC-3 cells. Koenimbin triggered the activation of caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 and the release of cytochrome c, decreased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and HSP70 proteins, increased pro-apoptotic Bax proteins, and inhibited NF-κB translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, leading to the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

Targeted disruption of PKCε from prostate cancer cells impaired COX-2 induction and PGE2 production. Notably, COX-2 inhibitors selectively killed prostate epithelial cells overexpressing PKCε, and this ability was greatly enhanced by Pten loss. Long-term COX-2 inhibition markedly reduced adenocarcinoma formation, as well as angiogenesis in a mouse model of prostate-specific PKCε expression and Pten loss. Overall, our results provide strong evidence for the involvement of the canonical NF-κB pathway and its target gene COX2 as PKCε effectors, and highlight the potential of PKCε as a useful biomarker for the use of COX inhibition for chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic purposes in prostate cancer.""","""['Rachana Garg', 'Jorge M Blando', 'Carlos J Perez', 'Priti Lal', 'Michael D Feldman', 'Emer M Smyth', 'Emanuela Ricciotti', 'Tilo Grosser', 'Fernando Benavides', 'Marcelo G Kazanietz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Protein Kinase C Epsilon Cooperates with PTEN Loss for Prostate Tumorigenesis through the CXCL13-CXCR5 Pathway.', 'Plumbagin Inhibits Prostate Carcinogenesis in Intact and Castrated PTEN Knockout Mice via Targeting PKCε, Stat3, and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Markers.', 'Genetic ablation of PKC epsilon inhibits prostate cancer development and metastasis in transgenic mouse model of prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in prostate cancer is mediated by protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon).', 'Protein kinase Cepsilon interacts with signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3), phosphorylates Stat3Ser727, and regulates its constitutive activation in prostate cancer.', 'PROTEIN KINASE C ALPHA IS A CENTRAL NODE FOR TUMORIGENIC TRANSCRIPTIONAL NETWORKS IN HUMAN PROSTATE CANCER.', 'Combined Ibuprofen-Nanoconjugate Micelles with E-Selectin for Effective Sunitinib Anticancer Therapy.', 'Targeting FTO Suppresses Pancreatic Carcinogenesis via Regulating Stem Cell Maintenance and EMT Pathway.', 'Identification of candidate hub genes correlated with the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis of prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Phloretin in Benign Prostate Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A Contemporary Systematic Review.']"""

Patients will receive psychosocial support and will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either supervised exercise (high-intensity aerobic and resistance training) or self-directed exercise (provision of guidelines), stratified by treatment status and site. Exercise prescriptions will be tailored to each participant's fitness and morbidities. The primary endpoint is OS. Secondary endpoints include time to disease progression, occurrence of a skeletal-related event or progression of pain, and degree of pain, opiate use, physical and emotional quality of life, and changes in metabolic biomarkers. An assessment of whether immune function, inflammation, dysregulation of insulin and energy metabolism, and androgen biomarkers are associated with OS will be performed, and whether they mediate the primary association between exercise and OS will also be investigated. This study will also establish a biobank for future biomarker discovery or validation.  Ethics and dissemination:   Validation of exercise as medicine and its mechanisms of action will create evidence to change clinical practice. Accordingly, outcomes of this RCT will be published in international, peer-reviewed journals, and presented at national and international conferences. Ethics approval was first obtained at Edith Cowan University (ID: 13236 NEWTON), with a further 10 investigator sites since receiving ethics approval, prior to activation.

In a screen to identify small-molecule dual inhibitors of both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent AR gene signatures, we identified the chalcone C86. Binding studies using purified proteins and CRPC cell lysates revealed C86 to interact with Hsp40. Pull-down studies using biotinylated-C86 found Hsp40 present in a multiprotein complex with full-length (FL-) AR, ARv7, and Hsp70 in CRPC cells. Treatment of CRPC cells with C86 or the allosteric Hsp70 inhibitor JG98 resulted in rapid protein destabilization of both FL-AR and ARv, including ARv7, concomitant with reduced FL-AR- and ARv7-mediated transcriptional activity. The glucocorticoid receptor, whose elevated expression in a subset of CRPC also leads to androgen-independent AR target gene transcription, was also destabilized by inhibition of Hsp40 or Hsp70. In vivo, Hsp40 or Hsp70 inhibition demonstrated single-agent and combinatorial activity in a 22Rv1 CRPC xenograft model. These data reveal that, in addition to recognized roles of Hsp40 and Hsp70 in FL-AR LBD remodeling, ARv lacking the LBD remain dependent on molecular chaperones for stability and function. Our findings highlight the feasibility and potential benefit of targeting the Hsp40/Hsp70 chaperone axis to treat prostate cancer that has become resistant to standard antiandrogen therapy.Significance: These findings highlight the feasibility of targeting the Hsp40/Hsp70 chaperone axis to treat CRPC that has become resistant to standard antiandrogen therapy.

However, the optimal radiation fractionation regimen for localized prostate cancer is unclear. Laboratory and clinical evidence suggest that hypofractionation may improve the therapeutic ratio of radiotherapy. We report our institutional outcomes using moderately hypofractionated, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and an endorectal balloon, with emphasis on long-term biochemical control and treatment-related adverse events in patients with localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   Between January 1997 and April 2004, 596 patients with cT1-T3 prostate cancer underwent IMRT using a moderate hypofractionation regimen (76.70 Gy at 2.19 Gy/fraction) with an endorectal balloon. Using D'Amico classification, 226 (37.9%), 264 (44.3%), and 106 (17.8%) patients had low-, intermediate-, or high-risk disease, respectively. The majority of intermediate- and high-risk patients received androgen deprivation therapy. Biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) was evaluated using 2005 Phoenix criteria and estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   The median follow-up was 62 months. Overall 5- and 10-year bRFS rates were 92.7% and 87.7%. For low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, the 5-year bRFS rates were 96.9%, 93.3%, and 82.0%, respectively; the 10-year bRFS rates were 91.4%, 89.3%, and 76.2%, respectively. Prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, and T stage were significant predictors of bRFS (all P < 0.01). The 5-year rates of severe (≥ Grade 3) adverse events were very low: 1.2% for gastrointestinal events and 1.1% for genitourinary events.

The aim of this study was to assess cancer mortality trends in Serbia.  Methods:   This nationwide study was carried out to analyze cancer mortality in Serbia during 1991-2015 using official data. The age-standardized mortality rates (per 100,000) were calculated by direct standardization, using the world standard population by Segi. The average annual percent change (AAPC) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed using joinpoint regression analysis. Age-period-cohort analysis was performed to address the possible underlying reasons for the observed temporal trends.  Results:   Over the 25-year study period, there were 466,075 cancer deaths (266,043 males and 200,032 females) in Serbia. Overall cancer mortality increased between 1991 and 2009 in both males (by + 0.9% per year) and females (by + 0.8% per year) and has been decreasing since then, by - 0.9% annually in both sexes. For almost all major cancers except stomach cancer, cancer mortality in Serbia demonstrated upward trends during the study period. The largest increases were noted in lung cancer among females (AAPC = + 3.7, 95% CI 3.5-3.9) and prostate cancer in males (AAPC = + 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.3).

Mutation or deletion of the PTEN tumor suppressor is a frequent event in metastatic CaP, and inactivation of the transforming growth factor (TGF) ß signaling pathway is associated with more advanced disease. We previously demonstrated that mouse models of CaP based on inactivation of Pten and the TGFß type II receptor (Tgfbr2) rapidly become invasive and metastatic. Here we show that mouse prostate tumors lacking Pten and Tgfbr2 have higher expression of stem cell markers and genes indicative of basal epithelial cells, and that basal cell proliferation is increased compared to Pten mutants. To better model the primarily luminal phenotype of human CaP we mutated Pten and Tgfbr2 specifically in luminal cells, and found that these tumors also progress to invasive and metastatic cancer. Accompanying the transition to invasive cancer we observed de-differentiation of luminal tumor cells to an intermediate cell type with both basal and luminal markers, as well as differentiation to basal cells. Proliferation rates in these de-differentiated cells were lower than in either basal or luminal cells. However, de-differentiated cells account for the majority of cells in micro-metastases consistent with a preferential contribution to metastasis. We suggest that active TGFß signaling limits lineage plasticity in prostate luminal cells, and that de-differentiation of luminal tumor cells can drive progression to metastatic disease.""","""['Yi Hao', 'Glen A Bjerke', 'Karolina Pietrzak', 'Tiffany A Melhuish', 'Yu Han', 'Stephen D Turner', 'Henry F Frierson Jr', 'David Wotton']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['Prostate cancer induced by loss of Apc is restrained by TGFβ signaling.', 'Epithelial Transforming Growth Factor-β Signaling Does Not Contribute to Liver Fibrosis but Protects Mice From Cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Activation of Akt signaling in prostate induces a TGFβ-mediated restraint on cancer progression and metastasis.', 'TGF-BETA IN THE NATURAL HISTORY OF PROSTATE CANCER.', 'Transforming growth factor-beta signaling: emerging stem cell target in metastatic breast cancer?', 'Biology and impact of lineage plasticity in ALK-positive NSCLC: a narrative review.', 'Computer classification and construction of a novel prognostic signature based on moonlighting genes in prostate cancer.', 'A N7-Methylguanine-Related Gene Signature Applicable for the Prognosis and Microenvironment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity in cancer: a shared pathway of therapeutic resistance.', 'From genomics to functions: preclinical mouse models for understanding oncogenic pathways in prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To determine the role of gonadotropins in the development of AD and investigate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy as a potential preventative and/or disease-modifying approach to AD management.  Methods:   Male Medicare beneficiaries aged 67 to 75 and hospitalized with prostate cancer (n = 115,789) were compared to three control groups: men of the same demographics undergoing a cholecystectomy (n = 97,267), herniorrhaphy (n = 68,778), or transurethral prostatectomy (n = 267,691). A proportion of the patients hospitalized with prostate cancer were assumed to have low concentrations of serum gonadotropins and sex steroids as a result of GnRH agonist therapy, while those in the control groups were assumed to have elevated gonadotropin but lowered sex steroid levels that are associated with andropause in this age group.  Results:   The rates of development of select diagnoses of dementia, including AD, over a twelve-year follow-up period following surgery. When compared to control patients, men hospitalized with prostate cancer have a protection against dementia after twelve years of follow-up, with relative risks ranging from 0.48 to 0.83.

Our objective was to characterize health care utilization that may explain these observed trends.  Methods:   MarketScan claims, which capture >30 million privately insured patients in the United States, were queried for all men aged 40-64 years for the years 2008-2014. PSA testing, prostate biopsy, prostate cancer diagnosis, and definitive local treatment were determined using associated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Current Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition codes.  Results:   There were approximately 6 million qualifying men with a full year of data. PSA testing, prostate biopsy, and prostate cancer detection declined significantly between 2009 and 2014, most notably after 2011. The prostate biopsy rate per 100 patients with a PSA test decreased over the study period from 1.95 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.92-1.97) to 1.52 (95% CI, 1.50-1.54). Prostate cancer incidence per prostate biopsy increased over the study period from 0.36 (95% CI, 0.35-0.36) to 0.39 (95% CI, 0.39-0.40). Of new prostate cancer diagnoses, the proportion managed with definitive local treatment decreased from 69% (95% CI, 69%-70%) to 54% (95% CI, 53%-55%). Both PSA testing and prostate cancer incidence decreased significantly after 2011 (P < .001).  Conclusion:   In a large cohort of privately insured men, PSA testing, prostate biopsy, prostate cancer incidence, and local definitive treatment for prostate cancer decreased between 2008 and 2014, most notably after 2011.

Chelerythrine (CHE), a naturalbenzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloid, formerly identified as a protein kinase C inhibitor, has also shown anticancer effect through a number of mechanisms. Herein, effect and mechanism of the CHE-induced apoptosis via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in prostate cancer cells were studied for the first time.  Methods:   In our present study, we investigated whether CHE induced cell viability decrease, colony formation inhibition, and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in PC-3 cells. In addition, we showed that CHE increases intracellular ROS and leads to ROS-dependent ER stress and cell apoptosis.  Results:   Pre-treatment with N-acetyl cysteine, an ROS scavenger, totally reversed the CHE-induced cancer cell apoptosis as well as ER stress activation, suggesting that the ROS generation was responsible for the anticancer effects of CHE.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our findings support one of the anticancer mechanisms by which CHE increased ROS accumulation in prostate cancer cells, thereby leading to ER stress and caused intrinsic apoptotic signaling. The study reveals that CHE could be a potential candidate for application in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Songjiang Wu', 'Yanying Yang', 'Feiping Li', 'Lifu Huang', 'Zihua Han', 'Guanfu Wang', 'Hongyuan Yu', 'Haiping Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['Rediscovery of Traditional Plant Medicine: An Underestimated Anticancer Drug of Chelerythrine.', 'Chelerythrine induces apoptosis via ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress and STAT3 pathways in human renal cell carcinoma.', 'Induction of reactive oxygen species-stimulated distinctive autophagy by chelerythrine in non-small cell lung cancer cells.', 'In vitro Anticancer Effects of JI017 on Two Prostate Cancer Cell Lines Involve Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Mediated by Elevated Levels of Reactive Oxygen Species.', 'Curcumin analog WZ35 induced cell death via ROS-dependent ER stress and G2/M cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Integrating network pharmacology and experimental validation to clarify the anti-hyperuricemia mechanism of cortex phellodendri in mice.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'Phytochemicals for the Prevention and Treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma: Preclinical and Clinical Evidence and Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Rediscovery of Traditional Plant Medicine: An Underestimated Anticancer Drug of Chelerythrine.', 'Roles of Reactive Oxygen Species in Biological Behaviors of Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, our previous studies on various tumor cells suggested resistance of SEC62 over-expressing tumors to this treatment. Therefore, we proposed the novel concept that e.g. lung-, prostate-, and thyroid-cancer patients should be tested for SEC62 over-expression, and developed a novel therapeutic strategy for a combinatorial treatment of SEC62 over-expressing tumors. The latter was based on the observations that treatment of SEC62 over-expressing tumor cells with SEC62-targeting siRNAs showed less resistance to Thapsigargin as well as a reduction in migratory potential and that the siRNA effects can be mimicked by the Calmodulin antagonist Trifluoperazine. Therefore, the combinatorial treatment of SEC62 over-expressing tumors was proposed to involve Thapsigargin and Trifluoperazine. Here, we addressed the impact of Thapsigargin and Trifluoperazine in separate and combined treatments of heterotopic tumors, induced by inoculation of human hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (FaDu)-cells into the mouse flank. Seeding of the tumor cells and/or their growth rate were significantly reduced by all three treatments, suggesting Trifluoperazine is a small molecule to be considered for future therapeutic strategies for patients, suffering from Sec62-overproducing tumors.""","""['Christina Körbel', 'Maximilian Linxweiler', 'Florian Bochen', 'Silke Wemmert', 'Bernhard Schick', 'Markus Meyer', 'Hans Maurer', 'Michael D Menger', 'Richard Zimmermann', 'Markus Greiner']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biomol Concepts""","""['The endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein Sec62 as potential therapeutic target in SEC62 overexpressing tumors.', 'Targeting cell migration and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response with calmodulin antagonists: a clinically tested small molecule phenocopy of SEC62 gene silencing in human tumor cells.', 'Sec62 bridges the gap from 3q amplification to molecular cell biology in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Effect of 3q oncogenes SEC62 and SOX2 on lymphatic metastasis and clinical outcome of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.', 'Targeting thapsigargin towards tumors.', 'Repurposing the antipsychotic drug amisulpride for targeting synovial fibroblast activation in arthritis.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein Sec62 as potential therapeutic target in SEC62 overexpressing tumors.', 'Antagonizing Sec62 function in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis represents a novel therapeutic strategy for head and neck cancer.', 'SEC62 and SEC63 Expression in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Tumor-Surrounding Liver Tissue.', 'Complexity and Specificity of Sec61-Channelopathies: Human Diseases Affecting Gating of the Sec61 Complex.']"""

Methods:   We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies published from 1980 to 2018. 21 studies were included with 98,739 participants and 11,573 cases. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effect models. Potential dose-response relationships were evaluated for PCa risk.  Results:   We did not detect an association about higher carbohydrate intake and PCa risk (OR:1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98-1. 26, I2 = 62.7%), nor association was detected about higher carbohydrate intake with advanced PCa risk (OR:0.95, 95% CI: 0.78-1.16, I2 = 14.1%) or non-advanced Pca risk (OR:1.01, 95% CI: 0.79-1.29, I2 = 64.4%).

However, the association between its pre-diagnostic levels and cancer incidence has rarely been evaluated.  Methods:   8793 older adults from the German ESTHER cohort were followed up for cancer incidence by cancer registry data. A directed acyclic graph was utilized to identify potential confounders. Multivariate Cox regression models were applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).  Results:   During 14-year follow-up, 1540 incident cancer cases, including 207 lung, 196 colorectal, 218 breast and 245 prostate cancer cases were detected. 8-isoprostane concentrations were positively associated with lung cancer, but not with cancer at the other sites. The HR (95% CI) for the association with lung cancer was 1.61 (1.10, 2.34) for comparison of the top with bottom tertile in total population. The association of 8-isoprostane levels with lung cancer persisted after the adjustment for smoking and other potential confounders and was multiplicative to the effect of smoking. However, 8-isoprostane levels did not improve lung cancer prediction when added to a model containing age, sex and smoking. A protective association of increasing 8-isoprostane levels was observed for prostate cancer incidence but this association was only statistically significant among current smokers.

Objective:   We prospectively gathered data from men undergoing prostate biopsy in multiple diverse North American and European institutions participating in the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group (PBCG) in order to build a state-of-the-art risk prediction tool.  Design, setting, and participants:   We obtained data from 15 611 men undergoing 16 369 prostate biopsies during 2006-2017 at eight North American institutions for model-building and three European institutions for validation.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We used multinomial logistic regression to estimate the risks of high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥7) on biopsy based on clinical characteristics, including age, prostate-specific antigen, digital rectal exam, African ancestry, first-degree family history, and prior negative biopsy. We compared the PBCG model to the PCPTRC using internal cross-validation and external validation on the European cohorts.  Results and limitations:   Cross-validation on the North American cohorts (5992 biopsies) yielded the PBCG model area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as 75.5% (95% confidence interval: 74.2-76.8), a small improvement over the AUC of 72.3% (70.9-73.7) for the PCPTRC (p<0.0001). However, calibration and clinical net benefit were far superior for the PBCG model. Using a risk threshold of 10%, clinical use of the PBCG model would lead to the equivalent of 25 fewer biopsies per 1000 patients without missing any high-grade cancers. Results were similar on external validation on 10 377 European biopsies.  Conclusions:   The PBCG model should be used in place of the PCPTRC for prediction of prostate biopsy outcome.

Patients and methods:   Patients diagnosed with mPCa between 2004 and 2013 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database and were grouped by metastatic sites into only NRLN, only bone, bone + NRLN and other sites ± bone/NRLN metastases. Multivariate Cox and competing risk regression analyses were performed to compare the risks of all-cause mortality (ACM) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) associated with bone + NRLN metastases before and after propensity-score matching to patients with only bone metastases. This was complemented with landmark and supplementary analyses.  Results:   Of 17 167 patients with mPCa identified, 63.1% presented with only bone metastases, while bone and NRLN metastases co-occurred in 8.9% of the cohort. On multivariate analyses, after adjusting for potential confounders (clinical and sociodemographic), patients with bone + NRLN metastases had a significantly higher risk of ACM (hazard ratio [HR] 1.161, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.084-1.243; P < 0.001) and PCSM (subdistribution HR 1.149, 95% CI 1.067-1.237; P < 0.001) compared with patients with only bone metastases. Landmark analyses limited to survivors of ≥6 and ≥12 months again showed a significantly increased risk of ACM for patients presenting with bone + NRLN metastases compared with patients with only bone metastases.

The aim of our study is to assess the uptake behavior in the clinical setting of 64Copper Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (64Cu PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) in prostate cancer.  Methods:   A retrospective study was performed in 23 patients with intermediate, high risk and progressive disease at primary staging of prostate cancer. All patients underwent 64Cu-PSMA PET. Overall, 250 MBq (4 MBq per kg bodyweight, range 230-290 MBq) of 64Cu-NODAGA PSMA was intravenously applied. PET images were performed 30 min (pelvis and abdomen) and 1-2 h post-injection (skull base to mid-thigh). Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were measured in the organs with high physiological uptake such as liver and kidney, and, additionally, background activity was measured in the gluteal area and in suspected tumor lesions using a HERMES workstation.  Results:   PSMA uptake was detected in prostate bed in nine patients, in six patients in distant metastases (bone, lung and liver) and in nine patients in lymph nodes. Of 23 patients, 5 (20.8%) did not show any focal pathological uptake in the whole body. The number of sites (prostate bed, lymph nodes, distant metastases) with positive PSMA uptake was significantly associated with PSA values before imaging (P = 0.0032). The 64Cu PSMA uptake increased significantly from 30 min to 1-3 h post-injection (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P = 0.002).

ADT depresses a man's testosterone to castrate levels, leading to declines in sexual function, and changes in mood. These changes can have profound impact on couples' intimate relationships.  Method:   Patients undergoing ADT, and their consenting partners, were followed on a variety of outcomes relating to mood, sexual changes, and relational intimacy. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Changes in these three domains are documented. A dyadic analysis was conducted on the primary outcome of relational intimacy in order to assess the role of changes in mood and various aspects of sexuality on couples' intimate relationships.  Results:   Declines were observed in the first 6 months on ADT for sexual function, sexual frequency, and relational intimacy. Sexual bother increased within the first 3 months on ADT. No changes in mood were observed. Dyadic analysis revealed important effects on couples' reports of relational intimacy. (A) Patient and partner ratings of emotional intimacy were higher when partners better understood the patients' mood state. (B) Patient and partner ratings of sexual intimacy were higher when couples were more sexually active.

However, therapeutic resistance remains a major issue. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that can silence multiple genes, regulating several signalling pathways simultaneously. Therefore, synthetic microRNAs may have therapeutic potential in CRPC by regulating genes involved in taxane response and minimise compensatory mechanisms that cause taxane resistance. To identify microRNAs that can improve the efficacy of taxanes in CRPC, we performed a genome-wide screen of 1280 microRNAs in the CRPC cell lines PC3 and DU145 in combination with docetaxel or cabazitaxel treatment. Mimics of miR-217 and miR-181b-5p enhanced apoptosis significantly in PC3 cells in the presence of these taxanes. These mimics downregulated at least a thousand different transcripts, which were enriched for genes with cell proliferation and focal adhesion functions.

We aimed to estimate the rates of infections after colonoscopy and OGD performed in ambulatory surgery centres (ASCs).  Design:   We identified colonoscopy and OGD procedures performed at ASCs in 2014 all-payer claims data from six states in the USA. Screening mammography, prostate cancer screening, bronchoscopy and cystoscopy procedures were comparators. We tracked infection-related emergency department visits and unplanned in-patient admissions within 7 and 30 days after the procedures, examined infection sites and organisms and analysed predictors of infections. We investigated case-mix adjusted variation in infection rates by ASC.  Results:   The rates of postendoscopic infection per 1000 procedures within 7 days were 1.1 for screening colonoscopy, 1.6 for non-screening colonoscopy and 3.0 for OGD; all higher than screening mammography (0.6) but lower than bronchoscopy (15.6) and cystoscopy (4.4) (p<0.0001). Predictors of postendoscopic infection included recent history of hospitalisation or endoscopic procedure; concurrence with another endoscopic procedure; low procedure volume or non-freestanding ASC; younger or older age; black or Native American race and male sex. Rates of 7-day postendoscopic infections varied widely by ASC, ranging from 0 to 115 per 1000 procedures for screening colonoscopy, 0 to 132 for non-screening colonoscopy and 0 to 62 for OGD.  Conclusion:   We found that postendoscopic infections are more common than previously thought and vary widely by facility.

The aim of this study is to identify mechanisms of HFD-induced prostate cancer progression, focusing on inflammation.Experimental Design: We administered HFD and celecoxib to autochthonous immunocompetent Pb-Cre+;Pten(fl/fl) model mice for prostate cancer. Tumor growth was evaluated by tumor weight and Ki67 stain, and local immune cells were assessed by flow cytometry at 22 weeks of age. Cytokines which correlated with tumor growth were identified, and the changes of tumor growth and local immune cells after inhibition of the cytokine signals were evaluated in the mice. IHC analyses using prostatectomy specimens of obese patients were performed.Results: HFD accelerated tumor growth and increased the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) fraction and M2/M1 macrophage ratio in the model mice. Celecoxib-suppressed tumor growth, and decreased both local MDSCs and M2/M1 macrophage ratio in HFD-fed mice. HFD-induced tumor growth was associated with IL6 secreted by prostatic macrophages, as were phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3)-positive tumor cells. Anti-IL6 receptor antibody administration suppressed tumor growth, and decreased local MDSCs and pSTAT3-positive cell fractions in HFD-fed mice. The tumor-infiltrating CD11b-positive cell count was significantly higher in prostatectomy specimens of obese than those of nonobese patients with prostate cancer.Conclusions: HFD increased MDSCs and accelerated prostate cancer tumor growth via IL6/pSTAT3 signaling in the mice. This mechanism could exist in obese patients with prostate cancer. IL6-mediated inflammation could be a therapeutic target for prostate cancer.

Identifying predictors of longer LOS can better equip doctors to counsel patients and facilitate more efficient patient flow and utilization of medical resources. The objective of this study was to identify pre- and intra-operative risk factors for postoperative hospital LOS in patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy in China.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data of 793 eligible patients with prostate cancer who had undergone radical prostatectomy in our institution between January 2011 and March 2016. Relevant preoperative variables, including patient characteristics, medical comorbidities, prostate cancer disease-specific variables, urinary tract symptoms, preoperative laboratory values, and intraoperative variables including operation type, operation duration, and blood loss, were analyzed. The outcome was postoperative length of stay which was calculated as the time from the date of operation to the date of discharge. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of this outcome.  Results:   The mean postoperative LOS was 11.7 days (±4.6 days) and the median 10 days (range, 5-46 days). According to univariate and multivariate analysis, operation type (open or laparoscopic), blood loss, Gleason score (≥8) and preoperative laboratory values of white blood count (WBC) were found to be the main explanatory predictors of postoperative LOS of patients with prostate cancer in our institution. Additionally, open surgery was the strongest significant predictor of longer LOS according to the standardized coefficients in this model.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that significant predictors of longer postoperative LOS in patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy in China include both preoperative variables of Gleason score, WBC and intraoperative variables of operation type (open or laparoscopic), blood loss. To shorten hospital LOS in patients with prostate cancer and optimize utilization of Chinese medical resources, efforts should be made to improve the intraoperative process and reduce the prevalence of preoperative risk factors.""","""['Qingmei Huang', 'Ping Jiang', 'Lina Feng', 'Liping Xie', 'Shuo Wang', 'Dan Xia', 'Baihua Shen', 'Baiye Jin', 'Li Zheng', 'Wei Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Surgical and postoperative factors affecting length of hospital stay after radical prostatectomy.', 'Predictive factors for prolonged hospital stay after retropubic radical prostatectomy in a high-volume teaching center.', 'Patient comorbidity predicts hospital length of stay after robot-assisted prostatectomy.', 'The technique of radical perineal prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative Prostate MRI: A Road Map for Surgery.', 'Effect of Early Postoperative Rehabilitation on Length of Hospital Stay after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Postoperative Effect Observation and Clinical Study of Dahuang Zhechong Pills from Jingui Yaolue in Treating Patients with Early-to-Mid Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Resection.', 'Patient characteristics predicting prolonged length of hospital stay following robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The role of body mass index on quality indicators following minimally-invasive radical prostatectomy.']"""

Varying combinations of exuberant abnormal new bone formation and some abnormal bone loss affecting lumbar vertebrae and the bony sacrum were observed in these individuals. Detailed lesion descriptions are followed by a differential diagnosis that systematically eliminates pseudopathology, infectious diseases, sclerosing bone disorders, and most metastatic processes. However, metastasized prostate cancer cannot be rejected and is highly consistent with the observed lesions. Metastasized pancreatic, bladder, or carcinoid tumors represent additional, though far less likely, diagnostic options. Anatomical and molecular signaling factors further validate this differential diagnosis. The paravertebral venous plexus of Baston plays an anatomical role in the metastatic seeding of lumbar vertebra from prostate cancer. Further, abundant molecular signaling mechanisms upregulate multiple bone-forming mechanisms in prostate metastases, though initially such lesions may originate as lytic phenomena. These multiple lines of evidence help demonstrate a multi-level framework for explanation in paleopathology and especially to help better elucidate the complexities of ancient neoplastic diseases.""","""['Haagen D Klaus']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Paleopathol""","""['Medieval example of metastatic carcinoma: a dry bone, radiological, and SEM study.', 'The History of Prostate Cancer From Antiquity: Review of Paleopathological Studies.', 'Metastatic carcinoma of presumed prostatic origin in cremated bones from the first century A.D.', 'Extensive periosteal new bone formation in a skeleton from post-Medieval Chichester, England: A probable case of metastatic prostatic carcinoma.', 'Heel pain as the inaugural manifestation of metastatic prostate cancer.', 'An Ancient Skeleton with Multiple Osteoblastic Bone Lesions Containing a Scapular Sunburst Appearance from a 5th-6th Century Grave Excavated in Oita, Japan.']"""

Class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which contain 4 isoforms, α, β, δ, and γ, are known to play important roles in cell growth, migration, invasion, and so on. However, the respective role of each PI3K isoform in cancer cell migration and invasion remains unknown. In a study that aimed to elucidate the respective role of the 4 PI3K isoforms, we investigated the change in migratory and invasive ability of DU145 cells after treatment with each PI3K isoform-specific inhibitor. Both migration and invasion of DU145 cells were potently blocked by each of the PI3Kβ inhibitors (GSK2636771 and TGX221) and PI3Kδ inhibitors (CAL101 and IC87114) while not obviously affected by PI3Kα inhibitor BYL719 or PI3Kγ inhibitor AS252424. Furthermore, knocking down PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ isoform led to a significant decrease in migration of DU145. The results suggest that PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ play key roles in prostate cancer cell migration, while PI3Kα and PI3Kγ might be redundant. Oral administration of GSK2636771 (100 mg/kg) and CAL101 (30 mg/kg) inhibited tumor growth in bone, an experimental model by intratibia injection of DU145 cells, with improved bone structure and bone mineral density analyzed by micro-computed tomography. Tissue staining indicated reduction of metastatic DU145 cells and osteoclasts in the bones of GSK2636771- and CAL101-treated mice compared to the untreated group.

Abiraterone is a clinical first-in-class inhibitor of cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) required for androgen biosynthesis. However, abiraterone also causes hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema, likely due in part to off-target inhibition of another steroidogenic cytochrome P450, CYP21A2. Abiraterone analogs were designed based on structural evidence that B-ring substituents may favorably interact with polar residues in binding CYP17A1 and sterically clash with residues in the CYP21A2 active site. The best analogs increased selectivity of CYP17A1 inhibition up to 84-fold compared with 6.6-fold for abiraterone.

It is not known whether cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) undergo metabolic re-programming. We postulated that CAFs augment lipid storage and amplify centrosomal or non-centrosomal microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) through a pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF)-dependent lipid-MTOC signaling axis. Primary human normal prostate fibroblasts (NFs) and CAFs were evaluated for lipid content, triacylglycerol-regulating proteins, MTOC number and distribution. CAFs were found to store more neutral lipids than NFs. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and PEDF were strongly expressed in NFs, whereas CAFs had minimal to undetectable levels of PEDF or ATGL protein. At baseline, CAFs demonstrated MTOC amplification when compared to 1-2 perinuclear MTOCs consistently observed in NFs. Treatment with PEDF or blockade of lipogenesis suppressed lipid content and MTOC number. In summary, our data support that CAFs have acquired a tumor-like phenotype by re-programming lipid metabolism and amplifying MTOCs. Normalization of MTOCs by restoring PEDF or by blocking lipogenesis highlights a previously unrecognized plasticity in centrosomes, which is regulated through a new lipid-MTOC axis.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.""","""['Francesca Nardi', 'Philip Fitchev', 'Omar E Franco', 'Jelena Ivanisevic', 'Adrian Scheibler', 'Simon W Hayward', 'Charles B Brendler', 'Michael A Welte', 'Susan E Crawford']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['DGAT1 Inhibitor Suppresses Prostate Tumor Growth and Migration by Regulating Intracellular Lipids and Non-Centrosomal MTOC Protein GM130.', 'PEDF promotes nuclear degradation of ATGL through COP1.', 'Anti-angiogenic pigment epithelium-derived factor regulates hepatocyte triglyceride content through adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL).', 'Cancer cell apoptotic pathways mediated by PEDF: prospects for therapy.', 'Pigment epithelium-derived factor in lipid metabolic disorders.', 'Pancreatic cancer and fibrosis: Targeting metabolic reprogramming and crosstalk of cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Trip13 Depletion in Liver Cancer Induces a Lipogenic Response Contributing to Plin2-Dependent Mitotic Cell Death.', 'Recent Advances on the Role of ATGL in Cancer.', 'Fibroblast heterogeneity in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Lipid Metabolism in Tumor-Associated Fibroblasts.']"""

We investigated the value of metabolically active bone tumor volume (MBTV) and total bone lesion activity (TLA) calculated on pretreatment fluorine-18-fluorocholine (F-FCH) PET/CT in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients with bone metastases treated with Ra radionuclide therapy.  Patients and methods:   F-FCH PET/CT imaging was performed in 15 patients with CRPC before treatment with Ra. Bone metastatic disease was quantified on the basis of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), total lesion activity (TLA=MBTV×SUVmean), or MBTV/height (MBTV/H) and TLA/H. F-FCH PET/CT bone tumor burden and activity were analyzed to identify which parameters could predict hematological toxicity [on hemoglobin (Hb), platelets (PLTs), and lymphocytes] while on Ra therapy. Pearson's correlation was used to identify the correlations between age, prostate-specific antigen, and F-FCH PET parameters.  Results:   MBTV ranged from 75 to 1259 cm (median: 392 cm). TLA ranged from 342 to 7198 cm (median: 1853 cm). Patients benefited from two to six cycles of Ra (n=56 cycles in total). At the end of Ra therapy, five of the 15 (33%) patients presented grade 2/3 toxicity on Hb and lymphocytes, whereas three of the 15 (20%) patients presented grade 2/3 PLT toxicity.Age was correlated negatively with both MBTV (r=-0.612, P=0.015) and TLA (r=-0.596, P=0.018). TLA, TLA/H, and MBTV/H predicted hematological toxicity on Hb, whereas TLA/H and MBTV/H predicted toxicity on PLTs at the end of Ra cycles. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis allowed to define the cutoffs for MBTV (915 cm) and TLA (4198 cm) predictive for PLT toxicity, with an accuracy of 0.92 and 0.99.  Conclusion:   Tumor bone burden calculation is feasible with F-FCH PET/CT with freely available open-source software.

However, there is currently no reliable method available to capture and enumerate all CTCs as most systems require either an initial CTC isolation or antibody-based capture for CTC enumeration. Many size-based CTC detection and isolation microfluidic platforms have been presented in the past few years. Here we describe a new size-based, multiple-row cancer cell entrapment device that captured LNCaP-C4-2 prostate cancer cells with >95% efficiency when in spiked mouse whole blood at ∼50 cells/mL. The capture ratio and capture limit on each row was optimized and it was determined that trapping chambers with five or six rows of micro constriction channels were needed to attain a capture ratio >95%. The device was operated under a constant pressure mode at the inlet for blood samples which created a uniform pressure differential across all the microchannels in this array. When the cancer cells deformed in the constriction channel, the blood flow temporarily slowed down. Once inside the trapping chamber, the cancer cells recovered their original shape after the deformation created by their passage through the constriction channel. The CTCs reached the cavity region of the trapping chamber, such that the blood flow in the constriction channel resumed. On the basis of this principle, the CTCs will be captured by this high-throughput entrapment chip (CTC-HTECH), thus confirming the potential for our CTC-HTECH to be used for early stage CTC enrichment and entrapment for clinical diagnosis using liquid biopsies.""","""['Xiang Ren', 'Brittni M Foster', 'Parham Ghassemi', 'Jeannine S Strobl', 'Bethany A Kerr', 'Masoud Agah']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Recent advances in isolation and detection of circulating tumor cells with a microfluidic system.', 'Nanoroughened adhesion-based capture of circulating tumor cells with heterogeneous expression and metastatic characteristics.', 'All-in-one centrifugal microfluidic device for size-selective circulating tumor cell isolation with high purity.', 'Microfluidic-Based Enrichment and Retrieval of Circulating Tumor Cells for RT-PCR Analysis.', 'Nanostructure embedded microchips for detection, isolation, and characterization of circulating tumor cells.', 'Biomarkers of Aggressive Prostate Cancer at Diagnosis.', 'The Applications and Challenges of the Development of In Vitro Tumor Microenvironment Chips.', 'Molecular Biomarkers in Cancer.', 'Application of Microfluidics in Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Recent advances in isolation and detection of circulating tumor cells with a microfluidic system.']"""

Investigating the role of CD133 in the normal biology of the prostate and in cancer is complicated by the lack of a sensitive and accurate antibody for its detection. Here, we describe the characterization of a unique antibody identified using human antibody phage display that can recognize CD133 in both formalin-fixed tissues and cell lines.  Methods:   A human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody phage display library possessing a diversity of 8 × 109 was screened against fully glycosylated recombinant CD133. A counter screen was performed against deglycosylated CD133 to select for clones that preferentially recognized a glycosylation-independent epitope. The lead scFv was analyzed by flow cytometry and cloned into a rabbit immunoglobulin scaffold for immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results:   The antibody designated HA10 was found to bind a glycosylation-independent epitope on the peptide backbone of CD133 with high affinity. As a reagent for flow cytometry, HA10 detected CD133 more accurately than a commonly used commercially available antibody. IHC analysis with HA10 documented the staining of basal cells and luminal cells in healthy prostate sections. Weak staining of luminal cells was observed in adenocarcinoma sections at a very low frequency. Examination of a LuCaP patient-derived xenograft tissue microarray found that only three of the LuCaP models were positive for CD133. The three CD133pos LuCaP models all originated from non-AR driven metastatic prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation. Subsequent interrogation of liver biopsies from a patient who failed second-generation anti-androgen therapy found high levels of CD133 staining. The original transurethral resection of the prostate from that patient was, however, absent of CD133.  Conclusions:   We have developed a novel antibody that was able to detect CD133 by both IHC and flow cytometry. Using HA10 as an IHC reagent, we found that CD133 is a marker for a very rare cell type in both healthy prostate and adenocarcinoma sections. Our preliminary investigation also suggests that there may be an association between CD133 and non-AR driven prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation.""","""['Paige M Glumac', 'Colleen L Forster', 'Hong Zhou', 'Paari Murugan', 'Shilpa Gupta', 'Aaron M LeBeau']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Exploitation of CD133 for the Targeted Imaging of Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Growth kinetics of CD133-positive prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of CD133 in normal human prostate stem cells and malignant cancer-initiating cells.', 'Prostate epithelial stem cells.', 'Prominin-1 (CD133) Expression in the Prostate and Prostate Cancer: A Marker for Quiescent Stem Cells.', 'Production of a Ribosome-Displayed Mouse scFv Antibody Against CD133, Analysis of Its Molecular Docking, and Molecular Dynamic Simulations of Their Interactions.', 'Isolation and characterization of human anti-CD20 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) from a Naive human scFv library.', 'Opposing transcriptional programs of KLF5 and AR emerge during therapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Structural Characterization of a Minimal Antibody against Human APOBEC3B.', 'Exploitation of CD133 for the Targeted Imaging of Lethal Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   In in vitro study, cell viabilities of human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), human prostate cancer cells (PC-3), human hepatoma cells (7721) and human colon carcinoma cells (SW480) were evaluated with cell counting kit-8. For L. robustum-treated Hela cells, early or late apoptosis were evaluated by annexin V/PI staining. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by staining cells with JC-1. Apoptosis was monitored by nuclear morphology based on chromatin condensation and fragmentation by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylinole (DAPI) staining. Caspase-3 and -8 activity levels were measured by a colorimetric assay. In vivo, to evaluate the possible mechanism of L. robustum-mediated antitumor effect, nude mouse xenograft study was also conducted.  Results:   In in vitro study, L. robustum was found to be toxic to HeLa, MCF-7, PC-3, 7721, SW480, with an half maximal inhibitory concentration value of 2-5 mg/mL (P<0.05). Moreover, externalization of phosphatidylserine, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase-3 and -8 were detected in L. robustum-treated Hela cells. Using a nude mouse model bearing Hela xenografts, we found that L. robustum reduced tumor volume and tumor weight (P<0.05), but had no effect on body weight and histological damage of important organs. Intraperitoneal injection of L. robustum caused a significant reduction in serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels (P<0.05). Furthermore, cleaved caspase-3-positive and terminal nucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were observed in L. robustum-treated tumor tissues.

One unsolved problem is the mechanism of regulation of DNA double-strand break repair by REV7 in complex with 53BP1 and RIF1, and its influence on repair pathway choice between homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining. We searched for REV7-associated factors in human cells and found FAM35A, a previously unstudied protein with an unstructured N-terminal region and a C-terminal region harboring three OB-fold domains similar to single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, as novel interactor of REV7/RIF1/53BP1. FAM35A re-localized in damaged cell nuclei, and its knockdown caused sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. In a BRCA1-mutant cell line, however, depletion of FAM35A increased resistance to camptothecin, suggesting that FAM35A participates in processing of DNA ends to allow more efficient DNA repair. We found FAM35A absent in one widely used BRCA1-mutant cancer cell line (HCC1937) with anomalous resistance to PARP inhibitors. A survey of FAM35A alterations revealed that the gene is altered at the highest frequency in prostate cancers (up to 13%) and significantly less expressed in metastatic cases, revealing promise for FAM35A as a therapeutically relevant cancer marker.""","""['Junya Tomida', 'Kei-Ichi Takata', 'Sarita Bhetawal', 'Maria D Person', 'Hsueh-Ping Chao', 'Dean G Tang', 'Richard D Wood']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""EMBO J""","""['SHLD2/FAM35A co-operates with REV7 to coordinate DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice.', 'An OB-fold complex controls the repair pathways for DNA double-strand breaks.', 'Shieldin complex promotes DNA end-joining and counters homologous recombination in BRCA1-null cells.', 'FAM35A/SHLD2/RINN2: A novel determinant of double strand break repair pathway choice and genome stability in cancer.', 'Shieldin - the protector of DNA ends.', 'Multi-omics analysis reveals distinct non-reversion mechanisms of PARPi resistance in BRCA1- versus BRCA2-deficient mammary tumors.', 'Pre-Existing and Acquired Resistance to PARP Inhibitor-Induced Synthetic Lethality.', 'CCAR2 functions downstream of the Shieldin complex to promote double-strand break end-joining.', 'MAD2L2 promotes replication fork protection and recovery in a shieldin-independent and REV3L-dependent manner.', 'CHAMP1 binds to REV7/FANCV and promotes homologous recombination repair.']"""

We aimed to identify pre- and post-operative predictors of BCR after RP in an Afro-Caribbean population in Guadeloupe (French West Indies).  Patients and methods:   The study included 964 patients who underwent RP for clinically localized prostate cancer between April 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010 in the University Hospital of Guadeloupe. The hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for single variable associations with BCR were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards regression. Multiple variable analyses for association with BCR were performed, including all variables that reached statistical significance (P value<0.05) in univariate analysis. A backward selection model was then applied with a P value ≥0.1 for retention in the final model. Sensitivity analysis was performed and restricted to patients with known values for all variables (complete case analysis).  Results:   With a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the BCR rate was 26.7%. In multivariable analysis, predictors of BCR before surgery were diabetes mellitus type 2 (DT2) (HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.02-1.85; P=0.038), pre-operative PSA>7.5ng/ml (1.49, 1.15-1.92; P=0.002), clinical stage T2 (1.55, 1.21-1.98; P=0.0006), Gleason score>7 or 4+3 (2.12, 1.54-2.91; P<0.0001), and percentage of length of biopsy positive scores (1.66, 1.24-2.20; P=0.0006). Predictors of BCR after surgery were DT2 (HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.01-1.85; P=0.045), pre-operative PSA>7.5ng/ml (1.37, 1.06-1.79; P=0.018), pathological Gleason score>7 or 4+3 (2.36, 1.74-3.19; P<0.0001), pathological stage pT3b (1.68, 1.15-2.45; P=0.007), positive surgical margins (1.72, 1.32-2.45; P=0.0001), and perioperative blood loss>2000ml (3.74, 1.37-10.2; P=0.01). The results were virtually the same by sensitivity analysis (complete cases), except for DT2, which was associated with BCR with borderline statistical significance in the pre-operative model and not retained in the post-operative model.  Conclusions:   Afro-Caribbean populations in French West Indies share the same major clinical and pathological risk factors of BCR after RP identified in other ethnic groups. Perioperative blood loss appears to be an additional and independent predictive factor of BCR.

Materials:   This prospective, observational, non-interventional, multicentre study was conducted in Algeria. Included patients who had locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer and were treated with triptorelin 11.25mg given every 12 weeks. LUTS were evaluated with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) until week 48 after treatment initiation. An IPSS>7 indicated moderate to severe LUTS. The primary objective of the study was to determine the distribution of IPSS at week 48.  Results:   This study enrolled 193 patients at 21 centres. A total of 144 participants had IPSS available at baseline and after baseline (136 patients had moderate to severe LUTS and eight had mild LUTS at baseline). At week 48, amongst the 116 patients with IPSS available and moderate to severe LUTS at baseline, 94 (81.0%) had moderate to severe LUTS and 22 (19.0%) had mild LUTS. At week 48, the eight patients with mild symptoms at baseline remained in this category. The proportion of patient with severe LUTS decreased from 53.7% at baseline to 12.1% at week 48.

Methods:   We identified 77 men with PC eligible for AS (PSA≤15ng/mL, stage≤T2a, Gleason score≤6, up to 3 positive cores, maximal cancer core length≤5mm) who underwent RP between 01/2008 and 08/2015. All patients had prebiopsy mp-MRI followed by systematic±targeted biopsies. For each patient, the likelihood of the presence of cancer on mp-MRI was assigned using Likert scale (1 to 5). The predictive factors for the presence of significant cancer on RP specimen (Gleason score≥7 and/or tumoral maximal diameter>10mm) were evaluated using logistic regression.  Results:   Median age was 61 and median PSA was 6.7ng/mL. Overall, 49 (64%) patients had a positive mp-MRI (score≥3). Clinically significant cancer on RP specimen was found in 45 (58%) patients (69% in MRI-positive patients vs 39% in MRI-negative patients). In multivariate analysis, a positive MRI was a predictive factor for the presence of significant cancer on the surgical specimen (OR=3.0; CI95% [1.01-8.88]; P=0.04), as was age (OR=1.17; CI95% [1.05-1.31]; P=0.004) and PSAD (OR=1.10; CI95% [1.01-1.20]; P=0.02).  Conclusion:   Mp-MRI is a useful exam for selecting patients eligible for AS even if the situation remains unclear after prostate biopsies including targeted biopsies. Upon confirmation by further studies, mp-MRI should be considered as an independent criterion before entering an AS program.

In open RP cohorts, obesity seems to be associated to an increased risk of PSMs, probably due to the technical challenge that obese men pose to surgical access. Minimally invasive RP has been claimed to possibly reduce PSM rate. Aim of the study was to explore the impact of obesity and body habitus on PSM risk and their localisation during laparoscopic and robotic-assisted RP.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed 539 prospectively enrolled patients undergoing laparoscopic and robotic-assisted RP with pT2 prostate cancer. The outcome measured was rate of PSM according to the BMI and surgical approach (laparoscopic vs robotic-assisted). Patients were categorized in BMI<25kg/m2, BMI 25-29.9kg/m2 and BMI >30kg/m2 groups respectively and compared using Kruskall-Wallis or χ2 test, as appropriate. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to assess the impact of BMI and surgical technique on PSM risk.  Results:   Overall, 127 (24%) of men had PSMs detected at final specimen evaluation. Mean PSM length was 3.9±3.4mm, and 30 (6%) men presented significant margins ≥4mm. Analysing the rate of PSMs across BMI categories, no significant association between increased BMI and PSM was detected (all P>0.48). On uni- and multivariate logistic regression BMI was not a statistically significant risk factor for PSM (P=0.14), nor was the minimally invasive technique (laparoscopic vs robotic-assisted) (P=0.54).  Conclusions:   In this study obese men do not appear to have a significant increase in risk of PSMs at RP compared to lean and overweight men when operated by a minimally invasive approach. The magnified vision and increased access to the pelvis allowed by a laparoscopic and robotic-assisted approach may be accountable for our findings. Larger studies are needed to validate our results.

Cohort studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the study. A combination of direct and indirect evidence was performed to evaluate the odds ratio (OR) and draw surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA). Nine eligible cohort studies were included in this NMA, including 20,644 patients suffering from T1-T3 PC. The pairwise meta-analysis revealed that compared with the ET regimen, the RP and RP+ET regimens exhibited comparatively higher overall survival rates (OR = 2.81, 95%CI = 2.09 ~ 3.78; OR = 3.15，95%CI = 1.80 ~ 5.50, respectively). The results of SUCRA values demonstrated that the RP + ET regimen occupied the first place (89.5%) in terms of overall survival rate, and the RP regimen came second (84.83%). Thus, the RP+ET regimen had better efficacy in the treatment of T1-T3 PC in combined-therapeutic regimens, and the RP regimen presented better efficacy in mono-therapeutic regimen.

Concentrations of sex steroid hormones have been hypothesized to explain this sex disparity. However, no prospective population-based study has examined sex steroid hormones in relation to EA/GCA risk. Thus, we investigated whether prediagnostic circulating sex steroid hormone concentrations were associated with EA/GCA in a nested case-control study drawn from participants in three prospective cohort studies.  Methods:   Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, we quantitated sex steroid hormones and sex hormone binding globulin, respectively, in serum from 259 EA/GCA male case participants and 259 matched male control participants from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study, and Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between circulating hormones and EA/GCA risk. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   Higher concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were associated with a 38% decreased risk of EA/GCA (OR per unit increase in log2 DHEA = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.47 to 0.82, Ptrend = .001). Higher estradiol concentrations were associated with a 34% reduced risk of EA/GCA (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.98, Ptrend = .05), and the association with free estradiol was similar. No other associations between baseline hormone concentrations and future EA/GCA risk were observed.

This study evaluated contemporary national-level trends and their relations with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing prevalence and explored trends in incidence according to disease characteristics with stage-specific, delay-adjusted rates.  Methods:   Joinpoint regression was used to examine changes in delay-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates from population-based US cancer registries from 2000 to 2014 by age categories, race, and disease characteristics, including stage, PSA, Gleason score, and clinical extension. In addition, the analysis included trends for prostate cancer mortality between 1975 and 2015 by race and the estimation of PSA testing prevalence between 1987 and 2005. The annual percent change was calculated for periods defined by significant trend change points.  Results:   For all age groups, overall prostate cancer incidence rates declined approximately 6.5% per year from 2007. However, the incidence of distant-stage disease increased from 2010 to 2014. The incidence of disease according to higher PSA levels or Gleason scores at diagnosis did not increase. After years of significant decline (from 1993 to 2013), the overall prostate cancer mortality trend stabilized from 2013 to 2015.  Conclusions:   After a decline in PSA test usage, there has been an increased burden of late-stage disease, and the decline in prostate cancer mortality has leveled off.

Methods:   Incidence data were obtained from the CDC-funded and NCI-funded population-based cancer registry programs and compiled by NAACCR. Data on cancer deaths were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics National Vital Statistics System. Trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex, race, and ethnicity were estimated by joinpoint analysis and expressed as the annual percent change. Stage distribution and 5-year survival by stage at diagnosis were calculated for breast cancer, colon and rectum (colorectal) cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, and melanoma of the skin.  Results:   Overall cancer incidence rates from 2008 to 2014 decreased by 2.2% per year among men but were stable among women. Overall cancer death rates from 1999 to 2015 decreased by 1.8% per year among men and by 1.4% per year among women. Among men, incidence rates during the most recent 5-year period (2010-2014) decreased for 7 of the 17 most common cancer types, and death rates (2011-2015) decreased for 11 of the 18 most common types. Among women, incidence rates declined for 7 of the 18 most common cancers, and death rates declined for 14 of the 20 most common cancers. Death rates decreased for cancer sites, including lung and bronchus (men and women), colorectal (men and women), female breast, and prostate. Death rates increased for cancers of the liver (men and women); pancreas (men and women); brain and other nervous system (men and women); oral cavity and pharynx (men only); soft tissue, including heart (men only); nonmelanoma skin (men only); and uterus. Incidence and death rates were higher among men than among women for all racial and ethnic groups. For all cancer sites combined, black men and white women had the highest incidence rates compared with other racial groups, and black men and black women had the highest death rates compared with other racial groups. Non-Hispanic men and women had higher incidence and mortality rates than those of Hispanic ethnicity. Five-year survival for cases diagnosed from 2007 through 2013 ranged from 100% (stage I) to 26.5% (stage IV) for female breast cancer, from 88.1% (stage I) to 12.6% (stage IV) for colorectal cancer, from 55.1% (stage I) to 4.2% (stage IV) for lung and bronchus cancer, and from 99.5% (stage I) to 16% (stage IV) for melanoma of the skin. Among children, overall cancer incidence rates increased by 0.8% per year from 2010 to 2014, and overall cancer death rates decreased by 1.5% per year from 2011 to 2015.  Conclusions:   For all cancer sites combined, cancer incidence rates decreased among men but were stable among women. Overall, there continue to be significant declines in cancer death rates among both men and women. Differences in rates and trends by race and ethnic group remain. Progress in reducing cancer mortality has not occurred for all sites.

To recapitulate these important aspects of TMPRSS2/ERG fusions, we generated several TMPRSS2/ERG knockin mouse models based on the endogenous Tmprss2 locus.

Hence, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of primary tumors and, more importantly perhaps, for the prevention of tumor progression and metastasis formation. Clinically relevant preclinical models are therefore urgently needed. An ideal, clinically relevant preclinical model would mimic the genetic and phenotypic changes that occur at the different stages of human prostate cancer progression and subsequent metastasis. In this chapter, transplantable xenograft prostate cancer models are described, in which human prostate cancer cells are transplanted into host animals (e.g., immune-deficient mice). Cancer cells can be administered to the small laboratory animals in various ways, including inoculation of the prostate tumor cells subcutaneously, at the anatomical site of origin (orthotopically), or at the metastatic site. In addition, we describe imaging methods suitable for small laboratory animals with emphasis on optical imaging (bioluminescence and fluorescence).""","""['Geertje van der Horst', 'Maaike van der Mark', 'Henry Cheung', 'Gabri van der Pluijm']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Models of Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Spatiotemporal assessment of spontaneous metastasis formation using multimodal in vivo imaging in HER2+ and triple negative metastatic breast cancer xenograft models in mice.', 'CT vs. bioluminescence: A comparison of imaging techniques for orthotopic prostate tumors in mice.', 'Animal models of bone metastasis.', 'In vivo models of prostate cancer metastasis to bone.']"""

The development of distant metastases and therapy resistance are major clinical problems in the management of prostate cancer patients. In order for prostate cancer to metastasize to distant sites in the human body, prostate cancer cells have to migrate and invade neighboring tissue. Cancer cells can acquire a migratory and invasive phenotype in several ways, including single cell and collective migration. As a requisite for migration, epithelial prostate cancer cells often need to acquire a motile, mesenchymal-like phenotype. This way prostate cancer cells often lose polarity and epithelial characteristics (e.g., expression of E-cadherin homotypic adhesion receptor), and acquire mesenchymal phenotype (for example, cytoskeletal rearrangements, enhanced expression of proteolytic enzymes and other repertory of integrins). This process is referred to as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cellular invasion, one of the hallmarks of cancer, is characterized by the movement of cells through a three-dimensional matrix, resulting in remodeling of the cellular environment. Cellular invasion requires adhesion, proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, and migration of cells. Studying the migratory and invasive ability of cells in vitro represents a useful tool to assess the aggressiveness of solid cancers, including those of the prostate.This chapter provides a comprehensive description of the Transwell migration assay, a commonly used technique to investigate the migratory behavior of prostate cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, we will provide an overview of the adaptations to the Transwell migration protocol to study the invasive capacity of prostate cancer cells, i.e., the Transwell invasion assay. Finally, we will present a detailed description of the procedures required to stain the Transwell filter inserts and quantify the migration and/or invasion.""","""['Arjanneke F van de Merbel', 'Geertje van der Horst', 'Jeroen T Buijs', 'Gabri van der Pluijm']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['MTBP regulates migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Over-expression of lipocalin 2 promotes cell migration and invasion through activating ERK signaling to increase SLUG expression in prostate cancer.', 'Differential expression of epithelial and mesenchymal proteins in a panel of prostate cancer cell lines.', 'The matrix environmental and cell mechanical properties regulate cell migration and contribute to the invasive phenotype of cancer cells.', 'Mechanism of prostate cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Berberine inhibits the progression of renal cell carcinoma cells by regulating reactive oxygen species generation and inducing DNA damage.', 'Establishing a Proteomics-Based Signature of AKR1C3-Related Genes for Predicting the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'PLGA Nanoparticles Containing VCAM-1 Inhibitor Succinobucol and Chemotherapeutic Doxorubicin as Therapy against Primary Tumors and Their Lung Metastases.', 'Apoptosis-modulatory miR-361-3p as a novel treatment target in endocrine-responsive and endocrine-resistant breast cancer.', 'Knockdown of hsa_circ_0008922 inhibits the progression of glioma.']"""

Furthermore, there is a subset of patients who do not respond to the treatment at all (de novo resistance). Preclinical testing using patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) has led to successful drug development, and PDXs will continue to provide valuable resources to generate clinically relevant data with translational potential. PDXs demonstrate tumor heterogeneity observed in patients, preserve tumor-microenvironment architecture, and provide clinically relevant treatment responses.

To achieve both dosimetric quality and delivery efficiency, we proposed in this study, a novel integrated optimization method for non-coplanar VMAT (4πVMAT). 4πVMAT with direct aperture optimization (DAO) was achieved by utilizing a least square dose fidelity objective, along with an anisotropic total variation term for regularizing the fluence smoothness, a single segment term for imposing simple apertures, and a group sparsity term for selecting beam angles. Continuous gantry/couch angle trajectories were selected using the Dijkstra's algorithm, where the edge and node costs were determined based on the maximal gantry rotation speed and the estimated fluence map at the current iteration, respectively. The couch-gantry-patient collision space was calculated based on actual machine geometry and a human subject 3D surface. Beams leading to collision are excluded from the DAO and beam trajectory selection (BTS). An alternating optimization strategy was implemented to solve the integrated DAO and BTS problem. The feasibility of 4πVMAT using one full-arc or two full-arcs was tested on nine patients with brain, lung, or prostate cancer. The plan was compared against a coplanar VMAT (2πVMAT) plan using one additional arc and collimator rotation. Compared to 2πVMAT, 4πVMAT reduced the average maximum and mean organs-at-risk dose by 9.63% and 3.08% of the prescription dose with the same target coverage. R50 was reduced by 23.0%. Maximum doses to the dose limiting organs, such as the brainstem, the major vessels, and the proximal bronchus, were reduced by 8.1 Gy (64.8%), 16.3 Gy (41.5%), and 19.83 Gy (55.5%), respectively.

Materials and Methods A total of 634 TZ lesions in 457 patients were identified from a prospectively maintained database of consecutive patients undergoing prostate magnetic resonance imaging. Prostate lesions were retrospectively categorized with the PI-RADS version 2 system by two readers in consensus who were blinded to histopathologic findings. The proportion of cancer detection for all PCa and for clinically important PCa (Gleason score ≥3+4) for each PI-RADS version 2 category was determined. The performance of PI-RADS version 2 in cancer detection was evaluated. Results For PI-RADS category 2 lesions, the overall proportion of cancers was 4% (one of 25), without any clinically important cancer. For PI-RADS category 3, 4, and 5 lesions, the overall proportion of cancers was 22.2% (78 of 352), 39.1% (43 of 110), and 87.8% (129 of 147), respectively, and the proportion of clinically important cancers was 11.1% (39 of 352), 29.1% (32 of 110), and 77.6% (114 of 147), respectively.

Materials and Methods Thirty-three men who underwent conventional imaging as clinically indicated and who were scheduled for radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection were recruited for this study. A mean dose of 4.1 mCi ± 0.7 (151.7 MBq ± 25.9) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 was administered. Whole-body images were acquired starting 41-61 minutes after injection by using a GE SIGNA PET/MR imaging unit, followed by an additional pelvic PET/MR imaging acquisition at 87-125 minutes after injection. PET/MR imaging findings were compared with findings at multiparametric MR imaging (including diffusion-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast material-enhanced imaging) and were correlated with results of final whole-mount pathologic examination and pelvic nodal dissection to yield sensitivity and specificity. Dual-time-point metabolic parameters (eg, maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax]) were compared by using a paired t test and were correlated with clinical and histopathologic variables including prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, and tumor volume. Results Prostate cancer was seen at 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in all 33 patients, whereas multiparametric MR imaging depicted Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 4 or 5 lesions in 26 patients and PI-RADS 3 lesions in four patients. Focal uptake was seen in the pelvic lymph nodes in five patients. Pathologic examination confirmed prostate cancer in all patients, as well as nodal metastasis in three. All patients with normal pelvic nodes in PET/MR imaging had no metastases at pathologic examination. The accumulation of 68Ga-PSMA-11 increased at later acquisition times, with higher mean SUVmax (15.3 vs 12.3, P < .001). One additional prostate cancer was identified only at delayed imaging. Conclusion This study found that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET can be used to identify prostate cancer, while MR imaging provides detailed anatomic guidance.

This radioisotope has shown to improve overall survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We sought to evaluate the impact of PSA flare on survival and its relation with metabolic parameters on 18F-labeled sodium fluoride PET/CT.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective study of 168 patients with mCRPC (median age 69; median PSA 29.7) receiving 223RaCl2. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using a log-rank test, were evaluated for patient groups corresponding to different definitions of PSA flare. Metabolic 18F-fluoride PET/CT data were analyzed as well.  Results:   Immediate PSA decline was observed in 49 patients (29.2%), whereas no PSA response was observed in 59 patients (35.1%). PSA flare (defined as rise after the first cycle followed by decrease below the baseline) was observed in 20 patients (11.9%) and PSA flare followed by a decrease from peak but not below baseline was observed in 40 (23.8%). The first flare subgroup had a median PFS and OS of 20.8 and 23.9 months, respectively. These outcomes were not significantly different from patients with immediate PSA decrease, but were significantly better than in patients with persistent PSA elevation (3.1 months for PFS and 11.5 months for OS, p < 0.001). Moreover, the PSA flare group showed an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) decrease significantly greater than non-responders (p = 0.003). Metabolic 18F-fluoride PET/CT data were available in 35 patients at baseline and during 233RaCl2 therapy. The tumor burden reduction, expressed by ΔTLF10 and ΔFTV10, was more evident within PSA flare group below baseline than non-responders (p = 0.005 and 0.001, respectively).

Although androgen deprivation therapy remains the main treatment for PCa, most patients would inevitably progress to castration-resistant PCa, which is the main cause of cancer-related deaths. Thus, novel antitumor agents are urgently needed. Recent studies demonstrated that aloperine (ALO) as a natural alkaloid showed antitumor effects in other cancer types. However, the biological function and underlying mechanisms of ALO in PCa have not been investigated.  Methods:   PCa cell lines including LNCaP, PC3 and DU145 were cultured and treated with ALO. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, apoptosis assay and cell cycle assay were conducted to assess the biological role of ALO. In addition, a PCa subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was established to evaluate the role of ALO in terms of proliferation and apoptosis in vivo. We further measured the protein expression levels of p-Akt/Akt, p-ERK/ERK, c-Myc, cleaved caspase 3, p21, p53, Bcl-2 and Bax using the Western blot 48 h after ALO treatment of PCa cells.  Results:   ALO effectively inhibited the cell viability of PCa by inducing cell cycle arrest via the activation of the p53/p21 pathway and triggering apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. ALO also inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and ERK protein kinases and activated cleaved caspase 3 while exerting antiproliferation function through inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in PCa cells.  Conclusion:   Based on our findings, we conclude that ALO could suppress the tumor growth and promote cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in PCa cells, which indicated that ALO could act as a novel therapeutic agent in treatment of human PCa.""","""['Zhixin Ling#', 'Han Guan#', 'Zonghao You#', 'Can Wang', 'Ling Hu', 'Lei Zhang', 'Yiduo Wang', 'Shuqiu Chen', 'Bin Xu', 'Ming Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['Aloperine: A Potent Modulator of Crucial Biological Mechanisms in Multiple Diseases.', 'Aloperine induces apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in hepatocellular carcinoma cells through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.', 'Aloperine induces G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HCT116 human colon cancer cells.', 'Aloperine inhibits the progression of non-small-cell lung cancer through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.', 'Aloperine inhibits proliferation, migration and invasion and induces apoptosis by blocking the Ras signaling pathway in human breast cancer cells.', 'Anticancer effects of natural phytochemicals in anaplastic thyroid cancer (Review).', 'Aloperine Ameliorates IMQ-Induced Psoriasis by Attenuating Th17 Differentiation and Facilitating Their Conversion to Treg.', 'Role of Plant-Derived Active Constituents in Cancer Treatment and Their Mechanisms of Action.', 'Aloperine: A Potent Modulator of Crucial Biological Mechanisms in Multiple Diseases.', 'LINC01272 Suppressed Cell Multiplication and Induced Apoptosis Via Regulating MiR-7-5p/CRLS1 Axis in Lung Cancer.']"""

Findings from those studies were heterogeneous, but some reported an association of excess body fatness with aggressive disease.Methods: We examined the relationship of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio with prostate cancer in African American (AA) and European American (EA) men in the NCI-Maryland Prostate Cancer Case-Control Study consisting of 798 men with incident prostate cancer (402 AA and 496 EA) and 1,008 population-based controls (474 AA and 534 EA). BMI was self-reported. Waist circumference and waist-hip ratio were calculated from measurements at enrollment.Results: A high BMI either at enrollment or years prior to it was associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer in AA men. In contrast, an elevated BMI tended to increase the disease risk in EA men. Waist circumference was inversely associated with prostate cancer in both AA and EA men, whereas a high waist-hip ratio did not associate with prostate cancer in AA men but tended to be associated with advanced/aggressive disease in EA men.Conclusions: Our findings reveal an obesity paradox among AA men in this study population, where a high BMI and waist circumference associated with a decreased disease risk.Impact: Our observations expand the knowledge of how obesity may affect prostate cancer risks in AAs.

Recently, it was observed that the nuclear fraction of mTOR is essential for the androgen-mediated metabolic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells. Herein, it is demonstrated that the androgen receptor (AR) and mTOR bind to regulatory regions of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) to control its expression, whereas dual activation of these signaling pathways also promotes SREBF1 cleavage and its translocation to the nucleus. Consequently, SREBF1 recruitment to regulatory regions of its target genes is induced upon treatment with the synthetic androgen R1881, an effect abrogated upon inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway. In turn, pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of SREBF1 activity impairs the androgen-mediated induction of the key lipogenic genes fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1). Consistent with these observations, the expression of the SREBF1, FASN, and SCD1 genes is significantly correlated in human prostate cancer tumor clinical specimens. Functionally, blockade of SREBF1 activity reduces the androgen-driven lipid accumulation. Interestingly, decreased triglyceride accumulation observed upon SREBF1 inhibition is paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial respiration, indicating a potential rewiring of citrate metabolism in prostate cancer cells. Altogether, these data define an AR/mTOR nuclear axis, in the context of prostate cancer, as a novel pathway regulating SREBF1 activity and citrate metabolism.Implications: The finding that an AR/mTOR complex promotes SREBF1 expression and activity enhances our understanding of the metabolic adaptation necessary for prostate cancer cell growth and suggests novel therapeutic approaches to target metabolic vulnerabilities in tumors.

However, no previous analyses targeted length of stay (LOS) changes over time after major surgical oncological procedures (MSOPs).  Methods:   Between 2003 and 2013, we retrospectively identified patients, who underwent prostatectomy, colectomy, cystectomy, mastectomy, gastrectomy, hysterectomy, nephrectomy, oophorectomy, lung resection or pancreatectomy within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. A total of 3 431 602 assessable patients were identified. We examined temporal trends of LOS after ten MSOPs, as well as LOS determinants and the impact of LOS on total hospital charges (THCGs). Univariable and multivariable linear, log-linear, logistic (MLR) and Poisson regression (MPR) analyses were used.  Results:   Mean and median LOS were respectively 6 and 4 days (IQR 2-7). During the study span, LOS decreased [Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC): -1.89%, p = 0.0002]. Of the ten examined MSOPs, nine showed a decrease that ranged from -4.47% in prostatectomy to -0.7% in mastectomy. Conversely, no decrease in LOS was recorded for colectomy (EAPC:+0.37, p = 0.015). In MPR analyses, robotic [Relative risk (RR):0.68, p = 0.0003] and laparoscopic (RR: 0.90, p < 0.0001) surgical approaches were associated with shorter LOS. LOS was directly related to THCGs.  Conclusions:   Since the implementation of ERAS protocols, LOS has decreased for nine out of ten MSOPs in a significant fashion. Although these gains may appear marginal on an annual basis, their cumulative effect, over the study span, ranges for 7.7%-49.2%, which can hardly be interpreted as marginal.

The primary goal of this project is identification and synthesis of simplified analogues of dactylolide that would be easier to prepare and could be investigated for antiproliferative activity in comparison with zampanolide. Extension of Almann's concept of a simplified zampanolide analogue to dactylolide in the form of desTHPdactylolide was attractive not only for reasons of synthetic simplification but also for the prospect that analogues of dactylolide could be prepared in both (17S) and (17R) configurations. Since Altmann's overall yield for the six-step procedure leading to the C9-C18 fragment of desTHPdactylolide was only 8.7%, a study focused on optimized synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation of each enantiomer of desTHPdactylolide was initiated using Altmann's route as a framework. To this end, two optimized approaches to this fragment C9-C18 were successfully developed by us using allyl iodide or allyl tosylate as the starting material for a critical Williamson ether synthesis. Both (17S) and (17R) desTHPdactylolides were readily synthesized in our laboratory using optimized methods in yields of 37-43%. Antiproliferative activity of the pair of enantiomeric desTHPdactylolides, together with their analogues, was evaluated in three docetaxel-sensitive and two docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell models using a WST-1 cell proliferation assay. Surprisingly, (17R) desTHPdactylolide was identified as the eutomer in the prostate cancer cell models. It was found that (17S) and (17R) desTHPdactylolide exhibit equivalent antiproliferative potency towards both docetaxel-sensitive (PC-3 and DU145) and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3/DTX and DU145/DTX).""","""['Guanglin Chen', 'Rubing Wang', 'Bao Vue', 'Manee Patanapongpibul', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Shilong Zheng', 'Guangdi Wang', 'James D White', 'Qiao-Hong Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem""","""['An amide mimic of desTHPdactylolide: Total synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation.', 'Synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation of new zampanolide mimics.', 'Total synthesis of (-)-zampanolide and structure-activity relationship studies on (-)-dactylolide derivatives.', 'Zampanolide and dactylolide: cytotoxic tubulin-assembly agents and promising anticancer leads.', 'Peloruside A: a lead non-taxoid-site microtubule-stabilizing agent with potential activity against cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmune disease.', 'An amide mimic of desTHPdactylolide: Total synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation.', 'New Zampanolide Mimics: Design, Synthesis, and Antiproliferative Evaluation.', 'Synthesis, conformational preferences, and biological activity of conformational analogues of the microtubule-stabilizing agents, (-)-zampanolide and (-)-dactylolide.', 'Synthesis and antiproliferative evaluation of new zampanolide mimics.']"""

We tested for trends in gene expression according to the level of EF as self-reported in 1992 for ages 20-29 yr, 40-49 yr, and the year prior to the questionnaire, 1991. There were no associations between EF and gene expression in areas of tumor after accounting for multiple testing. In contrast, in the adjacent normal tissue, 409 genes and six pathways were differentially expressed at a false discovery rate ≤0.2 across categories of EF in 1991. These results suggest that ejaculation affects the expression of genes in the normal prostate tissue. The identified genes and pathways provide potential biological links between EF and prostate tumorigenesis.

Biomarkers are therefore urgently needed to detect PCa metastatic signature at the early time. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs with the potential to be biomarkers for disease prediction. In addition, computer-aided biomarker discovery is now becoming an attractive paradigm for precision diagnosis and prognosis of complex diseases.  Methods:   In this study, we identified key microRNAs as biomarkers for predicting PCa metastasis based on network vulnerability analysis. We first extracted microRNAs and mRNAs that were differentially expressed between primary PCa and metastatic PCa (MPCa) samples. Then we constructed the MPCa-specific microRNA-mRNA network and screened microRNA biomarkers by a novel bioinformatics model. The model emphasized the characterization of systems stability changes and the network vulnerability with three measurements, i.e. the structurally single-line regulation, the functional importance of microRNA targets and the percentage of transcription factor genes in microRNA unique targets.  Results:   With this model, we identified five microRNAs as putative biomarkers for PCa metastasis. Among them, miR-101-3p and miR-145-5p have been previously reported as biomarkers for PCa metastasis and the remaining three, i.e. miR-204-5p, miR-198 and miR-152, were screened as novel biomarkers for PCa metastasis. The results were further confirmed by the assessment of their predictive power and biological function analysis.  Conclusions:   Five microRNAs were identified as candidate biomarkers for predicting PCa metastasis based on our network vulnerability analysis model. The prediction performance, literature exploration and functional enrichment analysis convinced our findings. This novel bioinformatics model could be applied to biomarker discovery for other complex diseases.""","""['Yuxin Lin', 'Feifei Chen', 'Li Shen', 'Xiaoyu Tang', 'Cui Du', 'Zhandong Sun', 'Huijie Ding', 'Jiajia Chen', 'Bairong Shen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Identification of candidate miRNA biomarkers from miRNA regulatory network with application to prostate cancer.', 'Identification of reciprocal microRNA-mRNA pairs associated with metastatic potential disparities in human prostate cancer cells and signaling pathway analysis.', 'Decreased miR-218-5p Levels as a Serum Biomarker in Bone Metastasis of Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of microRNAs in prostate cancer migration, invasion, and metastasis.', 'Assessment of miR-98-5p, miR-152-3p, miR-326 and miR-4289 Expression as Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Prioritization of microRNA biomarkers for a prospective evaluation in a cohort of myocardial infarction patients based on their mechanistic role using public datasets.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.', 'Multivariate competing endogenous RNA network characterization for cancer microRNA biomarker discovery: a novel bioinformatics model with application to prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Use of MicroRNAs as biomarkers in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA Dysregulation in Prostate Cancer.']"""

A number of melatonin derivatives have been developed and tested for their role in the prevention and treatment of neoplastic diseases. We recently proved the in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity of UCM 1037, a newly-synthetized melatonin analogue, on melanoma and breast cancer cells. In this study we evaluated UCM 1037 effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and cytotoxicity in LNCaP, PC3, DU145, and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated significant dose- and time-dependent UCM 1037 antiproliferative effects in androgen-sensitive LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Data from flow cytometric studies suggest that UCM 1037 is highly cytotoxic in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, although no substantial increase in the apoptotic cell fraction has been observed. UCM 1037 cytotoxic effects were much less evident in androgen-insensitive PC3 and DU145 cells.

The SHRs for SPC-specific deaths increased from the reference period 1980-1984 to a peak for first cancers diagnosed in 1995-1999 (SHR = 1.18, 95%CI 1.03-1.35), before a decrease in 2005-2009 (SHR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.70-0.95) in competing risk models. However, this pattern was not consistent in CHRs. For individuals with specific first cancers, those with a first prostate cancer in 1995-1999 ha d the greatest SPC mortality risk (SHR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.29-3.36).  Conclusion:   Competing risk models, but not Cox models, demonstrated temporal increases in SPC-specific mortality. Greater detection of non-fatal first prostate cancers appears to have contributed to this trend.""","""['Yuanzi Ye', 'Petr Otahal', 'Karen E Wills', 'Amanda L Neil', 'Alison J Venn']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Temporal trends in the risk of second primary cancers among survivors of adult-onset cancers, 1980 through 2013: An Australian population-based study.', 'Impact of family history of cancer on risk and mortality of second cancers in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer survivors: Risk and mortality in second primary cancers.', 'Mortality and morbidity in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta in Denmark.', 'What is the most appropriate period to define synchronous cancers?']"""

The goal of the current study was to investigate the use of brush border enzyme-cleavable linkers as a strategy for reducing kidney activity levels from radiolabeled PSMA inhibitors.  Methods:   PSMA-769 (6), a derivative of the prototypical PSMA inhibitor (((S)‑1‑carboxy‑5‑(4‑iodobenzamido)pentyl)carbamoyl)glutamate (12) modified to contain a Gly-Tyr linker, and its protected tin precursor (11) were synthesized starting from the basic pharmacophore molecule Lys-urea-Glu. An analogue of 6 containing d‑tyrosine in lieu of l‑tyrosine (PSMA-769-d-tyrosine) and the corresponding tin precursor (d-11) also were synthesized. Both radioiodinated and 211At-labeled 6 were synthesized by radiohalogenation of 11 and deprotection in situ. Similarly, radioiodinated d-6 was synthesized from d-11. Paired label biodistribution of [125I]12 and [131I]6 was performed in normal mice and in SCID mice bearing both PC3 PIP (PSMA+) and PC3 flu (PSMA-) subcutaneous prostate carcinoma xenografts. The biodistribution of [131I]6 and [211At]6 was also evaluated in this tumor model. Biodistribution of the two radioiodinated diastereomers of 6 was evaluated in normal mice and urine samples were analyzed for the presence of 4‑iodohippuric acid.  Results:   Compounds [131I]6 and [211At]6 were synthesized from 11 in overall radiochemical yields of 32.5 ± 0.1% (n = 4) and 22% (n = 1), respectively; radiochemical purity was >95%. In normal mice, renal uptake of [131I]6 was 1.4-, 2.8- and 161-fold lower than that seen for co-injected [125I]12 at 1 h, 4 h and 21 h, respectively. In tumor-bearing mice, kidney uptake of [131I]6 was similar to that for [125I]12 (P > 0.05) at 1 h and 4 h but was 6- to 7-fold lower at 21 h; however, [131I]6 uptake in PC3 PIP tumors was also lower than that seen for [125I]12 at 21 h (12.6 ± 3.4%ID/g vs. 36.8 ± 12.4%ID/g). Uptake of [211At]PSMA-769 in PC3 PIP tumors was slightly higher than that seen for [131I]PSMA-769 at 4 h (9.6 ± 1.6%ID/g versus 7.8 ± 1.6%ID/g; P = 0.002); its uptake in a number of normal tissues also was higher. In normal mice, kidney uptake of [125I]PSMA-769 at 4 h was about 73% of that seen for [131I]PSMA-769-d-tyrosine. Activity in the urine of mice receiving [125I]PSMA-769 contained mainly 4‑[125I]iodohippuric acid while unmetabolized intact molecule was present in the case of [125I]PSMA-769-d-tyrosine.  Conclusion:   Use of this brush border enzyme-cleavable linker reduced kidney uptake and resulted in improved tumor:kidney uptake ratios. Although further structural improvements are needed, this linker approach might be useful as a component in strategies for reducing renal uptake of radiolabeled PSMA inhibitors.""","""['Ganesan Vaidyanathan', 'Choong Mo Kang', 'Darryl McDougald', 'Il Minn', 'Mary Brummet', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Michael R Zalutsky']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['(2S)-2-(3-(1-Carboxy-5-(4-211At-Astatobenzamido)Pentyl)Ureido)-Pentanedioic Acid for PSMA-Targeted α-Particle Radiopharmaceutical Therapy.', '(18)FFluoroethyl Triazole Substituted PSMA Inhibitor Exhibiting Rapid Normal Organ Clearance.', '2-(3-{1-Carboxy-5-(6-18Ffluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid, 18FDCFPyL, a PSMA-based PET imaging agent for prostate cancer.', 'Inhibitors of prostate-specific membrane antigen in the diagnosis and therapy of metastatic prostate cancer - a review of patent literature.', 'Radiolabeled enzyme inhibitors and binding agents targeting PSMA: Effective theranostic tools for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'A Preclinical Study of an 125I-Labeled PSMA Ligand for Prostate-Cancer Puncture.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of 225Ac-Labeled Single-Domain Antibody for the Treatment of HER2pos Cancer.', 'Application of Cleavable Linkers to Improve Therapeutic Index of Radioligand Therapies.', 'Reducing the Kidney Uptake of High Contrast CXCR4 PET Imaging Agents via Linker Modifications.', 'Introduction to Antibody-Drug Conjugates.']"""

It is regulated by splice factors whose activities are in turn regulated by splice factor kinases and phosphatases. The CDC-like protein kinases are a widespread family of splice factor kinases involved in normal physiology and in several diseases including cancer. In humans they include the CLK1, CLK2, CLK3 and CLK4 genes. The expression of CLK1 is regulated through alternative splicing producing both full-length catalytically active and truncated catalytically inactive isoforms, CLKT1 (arising from exon 4 skipping) and CLKT2 (arising from intron 4 retention). We examined CLK1 alternative splicing in a range of cancer cell lines, and report widespread and highly variable rates of exon 4 skipping and intron 4 retention. We also examined the effect of severe environmental stress including heat shock, osmotic shock, and exposure to the alkaloid drug harmine on CLK1 alternative splicing in DU145 prostate cancer cells. All treatments rapidly reduced exon 4 skipping and intron 4 retention, shifting the balance towards full-length CLK1 expression. We also found that the inhibition of CLK1 with the benzothiazole TG003 reduced exon 4 skipping and intron 4 retention suggesting an autoregulatory mechanism.

Particpants and methods:   Men enrolled in the IMPACT study were invited to complete a questionnaire at collaborating sites prior to each annual screening visit. The questionnaire included sociodemographic characteristics and the following measures: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Impact of Event Scale (IES), 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36), Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer, Cancer Worry Scale-Revised, risk perception and knowledge. The results of the baseline questionnaire are presented.  Results:   A total of 432 men completed questionnaires: 98 and 160 had mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, respectively, and 174 were controls (familial mutation negative). Participants' perception of PCa risk was influenced by genetic status. Knowledge levels were high and unrelated to genetic status. Mean scores for the HADS and SF-36 were within reported general population norms and mean IES scores were within normal range. IES mean intrusion and avoidance scores were significantly higher in BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers than in controls and were higher in men with increased PCa risk perception.

Patients and methods:   Serum levels of MMP-7, Fas and FasL were determined by ELISA in 96 patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC): 21 docetaxel-resistant patients who received one single series and 75 docetaxel-sensitive patients who received repeated series of docetaxel. In addition to the 96 pretreatment serum samples, 987 sera collected during chemotherapy were also analysed.  Results:   Higher pretreatment serum MMP-7, sFas and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were significantly associated with both docetaxel resistance (P = 0.007, P = 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively) and shorter cancer-specific survival (P < 0.001, P = 0.041, P < 0.001, respectively).

Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) at two institutions (Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) between 1987 and 2008, and who had subsequent follow-up. Rates of biochemical recurrence, metastasis and death from prostate cancer were compared amongst patients with adverse pathological features (Gleason score ≥7, ≥pT3, or lymph node invasion) based on D'Amico clinical risk (low vs intermediate/high). We also compared survival outcomes between patients with and without pathological upgrading/upstaging amongst D'Amico low-risk patients. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess the association between clinical risk, pathological reclassification, and oncological outcomes.  Results:   We identified 16 341 patients who underwent RP, of whom 6 371 were clinically low-risk. Adverse outcomes in men with adverse pathological features were significantly lower in those with low clinical risk, with an ~50% and ~70% reduction in the risk of metastasis and death, respectively. Only pathological upgrading/upstaging to Gleason score ≥8, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node invasion from clinical low-risk disease, were associated with adverse outcomes. However, these types of reclassification were rare.  Conclusion:   Clinical low-risk patients with pathological upgrading/upstaging have substantially lower rates of important oncological outcomes compared to those with higher pretreatment risk and not substantially different than low-risk patients without pathological upgrading/upstaging.

In this study, we describe its potential anti-cancer activity using prostate cancer (PCa) cells as a model. We found that NA treatment (5-60 μM) significantly reduced the proliferation and colony formation capabilities of PCa DU145 and C4-2 cells in a time and dose dependent manner, reduced the migratory and invasive properties and increased apoptotic cell population. Mechanistically, we found that NA treatment to PCa cells resulted in a sustained activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). NA simultaneously increased acetyl CoA carboxylase phosphorylation and decreased pS6 phosphorylation, the two major substrates of AMPK. Further, NA treatment significantly elevated the cellular ADP/ATP ratio and altered glycolytic rate. We further observed a reversible decrease in oxygen consumption rate in NA treated cells when compared to the control. Finally, we performed global untargeted metabolomics which showed that NA treatment alters PCa cell metabolism at multiple sites including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid, and glutamine metabolism which supported our observation of a possible AMPK activation. In summary, we report NA as a novel small molecule activator of AMPK that alters cellular metabolism to induce energy crisis and ultimately cancer cell death.

Moreover, four prostate cancer-associated ncRNA 1 (PRNCR1, rs16901946 G/A, rs13252298 G/A, rs1016343 T/C, and rs1456315 G/A) SNPs were in association with cancer risk. No association was found between the PRNCR1 (rs7007694 C/T) SNP and the risk of cancer. In conclusion, our results suggest that several studied lncRNA SNPs are associated with overall cancer risk. Therefore, they might be potential predictive biomarkers for the risk of cancer. More studies based on larger sample sizes and more lncRNA SNPs are warranted to confirm these findings.""","""['Xin Huang', 'Weiyue Zhang', 'Zengwu Shao']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biosci Rep""","""['Association of lncRNA PRNCR1 polymorphisms with cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis of the current literature.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between long non-coding RNA polymorphisms and cancer risk.', 'The expression of long non coding RNA genes is associated with expression with polymorphisms of HULC rs7763881 and MALAT1 rs619586 in hepatocellular carcinoma and HBV Egyptian patients.', 'Genetic variants within ANRIL (antisense non coding RNA in the INK4 locus) are associated with risk of psoriasis.', 'Targeting long non-coding RNAs in cancers: progress and prospects.', 'Long noncoding RNAs in hepatitis B virus replication and oncogenesis.', 'LncRNA-Associated Genetic Etiologies Are Shared between Type 2 Diabetes and Cancers in the UAE Population.', 'Impact of Genetic Variants of Long Noncoding RNA Metastasis-Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1 on Uterine Cervical Cancer.', 'Association of Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs) ANRIL and MALAT1 Polymorphism with Cervical Cancer.', 'Research Progress on the Inflammatory Effects of Long Non-coding RNA in Traumatic Brain Injury.']"""

Objective:   To externally validate a previously developed nomogram predicting benign prostate pathology on MRI/ultrasound (US) fusion-targeted biopsy in men with a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3-5 region of interest and a prior negative 12-core systematic biopsy, and update this nomogram to improve its performance.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 2063 men underwent MRI/US fusion-targeted biopsy from April 2012 to September 2017; 104 men with a negative systematic biopsy followed by MRI-US fusion-targeted biopsy of a PI-RADS 3-5 region of interest (58%) met the study inclusion criteria.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   An MRI-based nomogram that had previously been developed in a multi-institutional clinical setting was externally validated. Predictive characteristics were age, prostate volume, MRI PI-RADS score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Bayesian logistic regression was used to update the previous model.  Results and limitations:   Median age of the external validation cohort was 68 yr, PSA was 7.2ng/ml, and biopsy confirmed benign pathology in 30% (n=31), suggesting a lower baseline risk compared with the nomogram development cohort. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed areas under curve (AUCs) from 0.77 to 0.80 for nomogram validation. An updated model was constructed with improved calibration and similar discrimination (AUC 0.79).  Conclusions:   Age, prostate volume, PI-RADS, and PSA predict benign pathology on MRI/US fusion-targeted biopsy in men with a prior negative 12-core systematic biopsy. The validated and updated nomogram demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy and may further aid in the decision to avoid a biopsy in men with a prior negative biopsy.

Objective:   We hypothesized that Social Security Administration (SSA) life tables' derived survival estimates closely follow observed survival of PCa patients. To test this relationship, we examined 10-yr overall survival rates in patients with clinically localized PCa and compared it with survival estimates derived from the SSA life tables.  Patients and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004), we identified patients aged >50-<90yr. Follow-up was at least 10 yr for patients who did not die of disease or other causes.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Monte Carlo method was used to define individual survival in years, according to the SSA life tables (2004-2014). Subsequently, SSA life tables' predicted survival was compared with observed survival rates in Kaplan-Meier analyses. Subgroup analyses were stratified according to treatment type and D'Amico risk classification.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 39191 patients with localized PCa were identified. At 10-yr follow-up, the SSA life tables' predicted survival was 69.5% versus 73.1% according to the observed rate (p<0.0001). The largest differences between estimated versus observed survival rates were recorded for D'Amico low-risk PCa (8.0%), brachytherapy (9.1%), and radical prostatectomy (8.6%) patients. Conversely, the smallest differences were recorded for external beam radiotherapy (1.7%) and unknown treatment type (1.6%) patients.  Conclusions:   Overall, SSA life tables' predicted life expectancy closely approximate observed overall survival rates. However, SSA life tables' predicted rates underestimate by as much as 9.1% the survival in brachytherapy patients, as well as in D'Amico low-risk and radical prostatectomy patients. In these patient categories, an adjustment for the degree of underestimation might be required when counseling is provided in clinical practice.

With modern antiretroviral therapy, PLWH are aging and cancer rates are changing.  Objective:   To project cancer incidence rates and burden (number of new cancer diagnoses) among adult PLWH in the United States through 2030.  Design:   Descriptive.  Setting:   HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study to project cancer rates and HIV Optimization and Prevention Economics model to project HIV prevalence.  Participants:   HIV-infected adults.  Measurements:   Projected cancer rates and burden among HIV-infected adults in the United States by age during 2006 to 2030 for AIDS-defining cancer (ADC)-that is, Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical cancer-and certain types of non-AIDS-defining cancer (NADC). All other cancer types were combined.  Results:   The proportion of adult PLWH in the United States aged 65 years or older is projected to increase from 8.5% in 2010 to 21.4% in 2030. Age-specific rates are projected to decrease through 2030 across age groups for Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cervical cancer, lung cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and other cancer types combined, and among those aged 65 years or older for colon cancer. Prostate cancer rates are projected to increase. The estimated total cancer burden in PLWH will decrease from 8150 cases in 2010 (2730 of ADC and 5420 of NADC) to 6690 cases in 2030 (720 of ADC and 5980 of NADC). In 2030, prostate cancer (n = 1590) and lung cancer (n = 1030) are projected to be the most common cancer types.  Limitation:   Projections assume that current trends in cancer incidence rates, HIV transmission, and survival will continue.  Conclusion:   The cancer burden among PLWH is projected to shift, with prostate and lung cancer expected to emerge as the most common types by 2030. Cancer will remain an important comorbid condition, and expanded access to HIV therapies and cancer prevention, screening, and treatment is needed.

Almost 50% of RUFs are associated with energy treatment modalities for PCa. The adjacent damage to healthy tissue along with limited pliability of it makes the success of the repair troublesome. There is no standardized approach for these scenarios.  Materials and methods:   For case 1, an 83-year-old man underwent cryotherapy for PCa. On postoperative day 14, he presented with urine per rectum. Cystoscopy confirmed the presence of an RUF. Urinary and fecal diversions were unsuccessful. Three months later, robotic surgical repair was performed. For case 2, an 85-year-old man underwent salvage therapy for PCa with high-intensity focused ultrasound after previous treatment with external beam radiation therapy. Two months postoperatively, he presented with urine per rectum. A computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of an RUF. Robotic surgical repair was subsequently performed.  Results:   Both patients underwent robotic-assisted RUF repair, including salvage prostatectomy , rectal defect closure, and omental flap placement. In the first case, healthy urethra was present after the salvage prostatectomy, and the next step was completion of a vesicourethral anastomosis. In the second case, the next step was closure of the bladder neck and suprapubic tube placement due to the extensive tissue destruction the residual urethra. Success was confirmed with imaging studies and no reported symptoms at 9 and 4 months, respectively.  Conclusion:   The robotic system is useful for the treatment of a complicated RUF.

Design, setting, and participants:   Multicenter, prospective cohort study of participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer randomized clinical trial of flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSG) beginning in 1993 with follow-up for CRC incidence to 2013 across the United States. Participants included 154 900 men and women aged 55 to 74 years enrolled in PLCO of whom 15 935 underwent colonoscopy following their first positive FSG screening result. The final day of follow-up was December 31, 2013.  Exposures:   Enrolled participants had been randomized to FSG or usual care. Participants who underwent FSG and had abnormal findings were referred for follow-up. Subsequent colonoscopy findings were categorized as advanced adenoma (≥1 cm, high-grade dysplasia, or tubulovillous or villous histology), nonadvanced adenoma (<1 cm without advanced histology), or no adenoma.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was CRC incidence within 15 years of the baseline colonoscopy. The secondary outcome was CRC mortality.  Results:   There were 15 935 participants who underwent colonoscopy (men, 59.7%; white, 90.7%; median age, 64 y [IQR, 61-68]). On initial colonoscopy, 2882 participants (18.1%) had an advanced adenoma, 5068 participants (31.8%) had a nonadvanced adenoma, and 7985 participants (50.1%) had no adenoma; median follow-up for CRC incidence was 12.9 years. CRC incidence rates per 10 000 person-years of observation were 20.0 (95% CI, 15.3-24.7; n = 70) for advanced adenoma, 9.1 (95% CI, 6.7-11.5; n = 55) for nonadvanced adenoma, and 7.5 (95% CI, 5.8-9.7; n = 71) for no adenoma. Participants with advanced adenoma were significantly more likely to develop CRC compared with participants with no adenoma (rate ratio [RR], 2.7 [95% CI, 1.9-3.7]; P < .001). There was no significant difference in CRC risk between participants with nonadvanced adenoma compared with no adenoma (RR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.8-1.7]; P = .30). Compared with participants with no adenoma, those with advanced adenoma were at significantly increased risk of CRC death (RR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.2-5.7], P = .01), but mortality risk in participants with nonadvanced adenoma was not significantly different (RR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.5-2.7], P = .68).  Conclusions and relevance:   Over a median of 13 years of follow-up, participants with an advanced adenoma at diagnostic colonoscopy prompted by a positive flexible sigmoidoscopy result were at significantly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with those with no adenoma.

However, different models select different screening populations. The performance of each model in selecting ever-smokers for screening is unknown.  Objective:   To compare the U.S. screening populations selected by 9 lung cancer risk models (the Bach model; the Spitz model; the Liverpool Lung Project [LLP] model; the LLP Incidence Risk Model [LLPi]; the Hoggart model; the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial Model 2012 [PLCOM2012]; the Pittsburgh Predictor; the Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool [LCRAT]; and the Lung Cancer Death Risk Assessment Tool [LCDRAT]) and to examine their predictive performance in 2 cohorts.  Design:   Population-based prospective studies.  Setting:   United States.  Participants:   Models selected U.S. screening populations by using data from the National Health Interview Survey from 2010 to 2012. Model performance was evaluated using data from 337 388 ever-smokers in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study and 72 338 ever-smokers in the CPS-II (Cancer Prevention Study II) Nutrition Survey cohort.  Measurements:   Model calibration (ratio of model-predicted to observed cases [expected-observed ratio]) and discrimination (area under the curve [AUC]).  Results:   At a 5-year risk threshold of 2.0%, the models chose U.S. screening populations ranging from 7.6 million to 26 million ever-smokers. These disagreements occurred because, in both validation cohorts, 4 models (the Bach model, PLCOM2012, LCRAT, and LCDRAT) were well-calibrated (expected-observed ratio range, 0.92 to 1.12) and had higher AUCs (range, 0.75 to 0.79) than 5 models that generally overestimated risk (expected-observed ratio range, 0.83 to 3.69) and had lower AUCs (range, 0.62 to 0.75). The 4 best-performing models also had the highest sensitivity at a fixed specificity (and vice versa) and similar discrimination at a fixed risk threshold. These models showed better agreement on size of the screening population (7.6 million to 10.9 million) and achieved consensus on 73% of persons chosen.  Limitation:   No consensus on risk thresholds for screening.  Conclusion:   The 9 lung cancer risk models chose widely differing U.S. screening populations. However, 4 models (the Bach model, PLCOM2012, LCRAT, and LCDRAT) most accurately predicted risk and performed best in selecting ever-smokers for screening.

Bone disease is routinely visualized using the technetium Tc 99m (99mTc) bone scan; however, the standard interpretation of bone scan data relies on subjective manual assessment of counting metastatic lesion numbers. There is an unmet need for an objective and fully quantitative assessment of bone scan data.  Objective:   To clinically assess in a prospectively defined analysis plan of a clinical trial the automated Bone Scan Index (aBSI) as an independent prognostic determinant of overall survival (OS) in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Design, setting, and participants:   This investigation was a prospectively planned analysis of the aBSI in a phase 3 multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of tasquinimod (10TASQ10). Men with bone metastatic chemotherapy-naïve CRPC were recruited at 241 sites in 37 countries between March 2011 and August 2015. The statistical analysis plan to clinically evaluate the aBSI was prospectively defined and locked before unmasking of the 10TASQ10 study. The analysis of aBSI was conducted between May 25, 2016, and June 3, 2017.  Main outcomes and measures:   The associations of baseline aBSI with OS, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), time to symptomatic progression, and time to opiate use for cancer pain.  Results:   Of the total 1245 men enrolled, 721 were evaluable for the aBSI. The mean (SD) age (available for 719 men) was 70.6 (8.0) years (age range, 47-90 years). The aBSI population was representative of the total study population based on baseline characteristics. The aBSI (median, 1.07; range, 0-32.60) was significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.20; 95% CI, 1.14-1.26; P < .001). The median OS by aBSI quartile (lowest to highest) was 34.7, 27.3, 21.7, and 13.3 months, respectively. The discriminative ability of the aBSI (C index, 0.63) in prognosticating OS was significantly higher than that of the manual lesion counting (C index, 0.60) (P = .03). In a multivariable survival model, a higher aBSI remained independently associated with OS (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .03). A higher aBSI was also independently associated with time to symptomatic progression (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.23; P < .001) and time to opiate use for cancer pain (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.30; P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   To date, this investigation is the largest prospectively analyzed study to validate the aBSI as an independent prognostic imaging biomarker of survival in mCRPC. These data support the prognostic utility of the aBSI as an objective imaging biomarker in the design and eligibility of clinical trials of systemic therapies for patients with mCRPC.

Recommendations were based on validation of the previously published values, parameter estimation and a consideration of their sensitivity within a tumour control probability (TCP) model using clinical outcomes data from low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy. The proposed TCP model incorporated radiosensitivity (α) heterogeneity and a non-uniform distribution of clonogens. The clinical outcomes data included 849 prostate cancer patients treated with LDR brachytherapy at four Australian centres between 1995 and 2012. Phoenix definition of biochemical failure was used. Validation of the published values from four selected literature and parameter estimation was performed with a maximum likelihood estimation method. Each parameter was varied to evaluate the change in calculated TCP to quantify the sensitivity of the model to its radiobiological parameters. Using a previously published parameter set and a total clonogen number of 196 000 provided TCP estimates that best described the patient cohort. Fitting of all parameters with a maximum likelihood estimation was not possible. Variations in prostate TCP ranged from 0.004% to 0.67% per 1% change in each parameter. The largest variation was caused by the log-normal distribution parameters for α (mean, [Formula: see text], and standard deviation, σ α ). Based on the results using the clinical cohort data, we recommend a previously published dataset is used for future application of the TCP model with inclusion of a patient-specific, non-uniform clonogen density distribution which could be derived from multiparametric imaging.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) stably expressed in cells and involved in a series of carcinomas. However, few research studies have reported on the role of circRNAs in PCa. MATERIAL AND METHODS We used qRT-PCR to detect the expression of circMYLK (circRNA ID: hsa_circ_0141940) and miR-29a in PCa tissues and cell lines. MTT, colony formation, and TUNEL assays were performed to analysis the cell viability of PCa cells. Transwell and wound scratch assays were performed to investigate the cell invasion and migration of PCa cells. RESULTS In the present study, we confirmed that circMYLK expression level was significantly higher in PCa samples and PCa cells than in normal tissues and normal prostatic cells. The upregulated circRNA-MYLK promoted PCa cells proliferation, invasion, and migration; however, si-circRNA-MYLK significantly accelerated the PCa cell apoptosis. We also observed that the aforementioned function of circRNA-MYLK on PCa cells was affected through targeting miR-29a.

Our previous study has reported that microRNA-30d (miR-30d) expression can predicted poor clinical prognosis in PCa, however, the underlying mechanisms of miR-30d have not been fully described. The aim of our study is to investigate the expression relevance between miR-30d and ARID4A or ARID4B, and examine the clinical significance and biological function of ARID4A and AIRD4B in PCa. In this study, both ARID4A and ARID4B were identified as the target genes of miR-30d. In addition, the mRNA expression of miR-30d in PCa tissues were significantly negative correlated with ARID4A (Pearson correlation coefficient = -0.313, P = 0.001) and ARID4B (Pearson correlation coefficient = -0.349, P < 0.001), while there was a positive correlation between ARID4A and ARID4B (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.865, P < 0.001). Moreover, both ARID4A and ARID4B were significantly downregulated in PCa tissues with high Gleason scores (P = 0.005, P = 0.033), PSA failure (P = 0.012, P = 0.05) and short biochemical recurrent-free survival (P = 0.033, P = 0.031).

Here, we determine patient discharge dates according to European guidelines.  Methods:   In 40 patients with NET and 25 patients with CRPC organ and tumour doses based on the MIRD concept were calculated from data obtained during the first therapy cycle. Planar whole body images were recorded at 0.5, 4, 20, 68 und 92 h postinjection. Residence times were calculated from the respective time-activity-curves based on the conjugated view method. Residence times for critical organs were fitted into the commercially available OLINDA software to calculate the organ doses. The doses of tumours and salivary glands were calculated via their self-irradiation by approximation with spheres of equivalent volume. Kidney volumes were gained by organ segmentation, volumes of all other organs were estimated by means of OLINDA and hence were lean body mass corrected. Out of the whole body curves reference points for patient discharge were estimated.  Results:   In patients with NET discharge dates could be properly estimated from dosimetric data, which is not only crucial for radiation protection, but also makes therapy planning easier. For 177Lu-PSMA-617 ligand therapy it is difficult to seriously estimate a generalized discharge date due to large interpatient variation resulting from different tumor loads and heavy pre-treatment.

However, no study to date has evaluated the long-term outcomes of this treatment among patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. We retrospectively examined the treatment outcomes of patients with prostate-specific antigen recurrence who underwent radical prostatectomy at our department.  Materials and methods:   Of the 690 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for local prostate cancer between 1988 and 2011, 129 patients who received androgen deprivation therapy for prostate-specific antigen recurrence were included in this study. Patient characteristics, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist administration, and outcomes were compared between the intermittent androgen deprivation group (n = 66) and the continuous androgen deprivation therapy group (n = 63). The non-recurrence and overall survival rates were compared between groups.  Results:   Thirty-six patients (27.9%) experienced recurrence after luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist administration. The 5-year non-recurrence rate and 10-year overall survival rate were higher in the intermittent group (92.9%) than in the continuous group (92.9 vs 57.9%, P < 0.001; and 95.9% vs 84.3%, P = 0.047, respectively). Furthermore, 63 patients (48.8%) showed a PSA nadir of less than 0.01 ng/mL after initiation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist; among these patients, the non-recurrence rate was significantly higher in the intermittent androgen deprivation group (P = 0.003).

Drug development efforts have been focused on kinases in this pathway, most notably on RAF and MEK. We show here that MEK inhibition activates JNK-JUN signaling through suppression of DUSP4, leading to activation of HER Receptor Tyrosine Kinases. This stimulates the MAPK pathway in the presence of drug, thereby blunting the effect of MEK inhibition. Cancers that have lost MAP3K1 or MAP2K4 fail to activate JNK-JUN. Consequently, loss-of-function mutations in either MAP3K1 or MAP2K4 confer sensitivity to MEK inhibition by disabling JNK-JUN-mediated feedback loop upon MEK inhibition. In a panel of 168 Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) tumors, MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 mutation status is a strong predictor of response to MEK inhibition. Our findings suggest that cancers having mutations in MAP3K1 or MAP2K4, which are frequent in tumors of breast, prostate and colon, may respond to MEK inhibitors. Our findings also suggest that MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 are potential drug targets in combination with MEK inhibitors, in spite of the fact that they are encoded by tumor suppressor genes.""","""['Zheng Xue', 'Daniel J Vis', 'Alejandra Bruna', 'Tonci Sustic', 'Sake van Wageningen', 'Ankita Sati Batra', 'Oscar M Rueda', 'Evert Bosdriesz', 'Carlos Caldas', 'Lodewyk F A Wessels', 'René Bernards']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Res""","""['A role for the unfolded protein response stress sensor ERN1 in regulating the response to MEK inhibitors in KRAS mutant colon cancers.', 'Rational combination therapy with PARP and MEK inhibitors capitalizes on therapeutic liabilities in RAS mutant cancers.', 'The effect of mTOR inhibition alone or combined with MEK inhibitors on brain metastasis: an in vivo analysis in triple-negative breast cancer models.', 'Resistance to MEK inhibitors: should we co-target upstream?', 'Dual Inhibition of MEK and PI3K Pathway in KRAS and BRAF Mutated Colorectal Cancers.', 'Dysfunction of ubiquitin protein ligase MYCBP2 leads to cell resilience in human breast cancers.', 'Lenvatinib resistance mechanism and potential ways to conquer.', 'Landscape of Genetic Alterations Underlying Hallmark Signature Changes in Cancer Reveals TP53 Aneuploidy-driven Metabolic Reprogramming.', 'A novel cuproptosis-related prognostic 2-lncRNAs signature in breast cancer.', 'Rational combinations of targeted cancer therapies: background, advances and challenges.']"""

We used the US population-based cancer registry data to evaluate risk of myeloid neoplasms among three cohorts of cancer survivors initially treated with radiotherapy only. We included 1-year survivors of first primary thyroid (radioiodine only, stages I-IV; N = 49 879), prostate (excluding stage IV; N = 237 439), or uterine corpus cancers (stage I-II; N = 16 208) diagnosed during 2000-2013. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs).

Using a PTEN-null transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer, we tested the effect of modifying serum cholesterol levels on prostate tumor development and growth. We hypothesized that serum cholesterol reduction would lower tumor androgens and slow prostate cancer growth.  Methods:   PTENloxP/loxP-Cre+ mice consuming ad libitum high fat, high cholesterol diets (40% fat, 1.25% cholesterol) were randomized after weaning to receive the cholesterol uptake inhibitor, ezetimibe (30 mg/kg/day), or no intervention, and sacrificed at 2, 3, or 4 months of age. Serum cholesterol and testosterone were measured by ELISA and intraprostatic androgens by mass spectrometry. Prostate histology was graded, and proliferation and apoptosis in tumor epithelium and stroma was assessed by Ki67 and TUNEL, respectively.  Results:   Ezetimibe-treated mice had lower serum cholesterol at 4 months (p = 0.031). Serum cholesterol was positively correlated with prostate weight (p = 0.033) and tumor epithelial proliferation (p = 0.069), and negatively correlated with tumor epithelial apoptosis (p = 0.004). Serum cholesterol was unrelated to body weight (p = 0.195). Tumor stromal cell proliferation was reduced in the ezetimibe group (p = 0.010). Increased serum cholesterol at 4 months was associated with elevated intraprostatic DHEA, testosterone, and androstenedione (p = 0.043, p = 0.074, p = 0.031, respectively). However, cholesterol reduction did not significantly affect adenocarcinoma development at 2, 3, or 4 months of age (0, 78, and 100% in ezetimibe-treated vs. 0, 80, and 100% in mice not receiving ezetimibe).  Conclusions:   Though serum cholesterol reduction did not significantly affect the rate of adenocarcinoma development in the PTEN-null transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer, it lowered intraprostatic androgens and slowed tumor growth. These findings support a role for serum cholesterol in promoting prostate cancer growth, potentially via enhanced tumor androgen signaling, and may provide new insight into cholesterol-lowering interventions for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Emma H Allott', 'Elizabeth M Masko', 'Alexis R Freedland', 'Everardo Macias', 'Kristine Pelton', 'Keith R Solomon', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'George V Thomas', 'Salvatore V Pizzo', 'Michael R Freeman', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Evidence for Feedback Regulation Following Cholesterol Lowering Therapy in a Prostate Cancer Xenograft Model.', 'Impact of carbohydrate restriction in the context of obesity on prostate tumor growth in the Hi-Myc transgenic mouse model.', 'Targeted biallelic inactivation of Pten in the mouse prostate leads to prostate cancer accompanied by increased epithelial cell proliferation but not by reduced apoptosis.', 'Cell-cycle dysregulation and the molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer.', 'Modeling prostate cancer in mice: something old, something new, something premalignant, something metastatic.', 'Defining cellular population dynamics at single-cell resolution during prostate cancer progression.', 'Statin Use and Survival Among Men Receiving Androgen-Ablative Therapies for Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Ezetimibe and Cancer: Is There a Connection?', 'The effect of lowering cholesterol through diet on serum prostate-specific antigen levels: A secondary analysis of clinical trials.', 'Inverse Association between Statin Use and Cancer Mortality Relates to Cholesterol Level.']"""

We sought to determine if PSA predicts incident LUTS in these men.  Methods:   A post-hoc analysis of the 4-year REDUCE study was performed to assess for incident LUTS in 1534 men with mild to no LUTS at baseline. The primary aim was to determine whether PSA independently predicted incident LUTS after adjusting for the key clinical variables of age, prostate size, and baseline International prostate symptom score (IPSS). Incident LUTS was defined as the first report of medical treatment, surgery, or sustained clinically significant symptoms (two IPSS >14). Cox proportional hazards, cumulative incidence curves, and the log-rank test were used to test our hypothesis.  Results:   A total of 1534 men with baseline IPSS <8 were included in the study cohort. At baseline, there were 335 men with PSA 2.5-4 ng/mL, 589 with PSA 4.1-6 ng/mL, and 610 with PSA 6-10 ng/mL. During the 4-year study, 196 men progressed to incident LUTS (50.5% medical treatment, 9% surgery, and 40.5% new symptoms). As a continuous variable, higher PSA was associated with increased incident LUTS on univariable (HR 1.09, p = 0.019) and multivariable (HR 1.08, p = 0.040) analysis. Likewise, baseline PSA 6-10 ng/mL was associated with increased incident LUTS vs. PSA 2.5-4 ng/mL in adjusted models (HR 1.68, p = 0.016). This association was also observed in men with PSA 4.1-6 ng/mL vs. PSA 2.5-4 ng/mL (HR 1.60, p = 0.032).

Methods: A total of 102 patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI before intended radical prostatectomy with lymph node dissection. Preoperative variables determined the probabilities for lymph node metastases (LNM), extracapsular extension (ECE), and seminal vesical involvement (SVI) using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram and Partin tables. Receiver-operating-characteristic analyses were performed to determine best discriminatory cutoffs. On a cohort basis, positivity rates of imaging and nomograms were compared with pathologic prevalence. On a patient basis, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curves were calculated. Finally, the full concordance of each method to postoperative T and N stage was determined. Results: Seventy-three patients were finally analyzed. On a cohort basis, the MSKCC nomogram (39.7%) positivity rate was most concordant with pathologic prevalence for LNM (34.3%) compared with Partin tables (14.1%) and imaging (20.6%). Prevalence of ECE (72.6%) was best predicted by MSKCC nomograms and imaging (83.6% each), compared with Partin tables (38.4%). For prevalence of SVI (45.2%), imaging (47.9%) performed superior to MSKCC (37.6%) and Partin tables (19.3%). On a patient basis, AUCs for LNM, ECE, and SVI did not differ significantly between tests (P > 0.05). Imaging revealed a high specificity (100%) for LNM and a sensitivity (60%) comparable to the MSKCC nomogram (68%) and Partin tables (60%). For ECE, imaging revealed the highest sensitivity (94.3%) compared with the MSKCC nomogram (66%) and Partin tables (71.1%). For SVI, sensitivity and specificity of imaging and the MSKCC nomogram were comparable (81.5% and 80% vs. 87.9% and 75%). The rate of concordance to the final pTN stage was 60.3% for imaging, 52.1% for the MSKCC nomogram, and 39.7% for Partin tables. Conclusion: In our analysis, preoperative 1-stop-shop 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI performs at least equally for T and N stage prediction compared with nomograms in high-risk prostate cancer patients. Despite an improved prediction of the full final stage and the yield of additional anatomic information, the use of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI warrants further prospective evaluation.""","""['Mark Thalgott', 'Charlotte Düwel', 'Isabel Rauscher', 'Matthias M Heck', 'Bernhard Haller', 'Andrei Gafita', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Matthias Eiber']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric MRI versus 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI for Extracapsular Extension and Seminal Vesicle Invasion in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'External Validation of a Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Nomogram for the Prediction of Extracapsular Extension and Seminal Vesicle Invasion in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Comparison of 68Ga-labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Development and external validation of a multivariable 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET-based prediction model for lymph node involvement in men with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Prebiopsy 68Ga-PSMA PET imaging: can we improve the current diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer?', '18F-Fluciclovine versus PSMA PET Imaging in Primary Tumor Detection during Initial Staging of High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Molecular Imaging in Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer Patients: Current Aspects and Future Trends.', 'Head-to-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and Multiparametric MRI for Pelvic Lymph Node Staging Prior to Radical Prostatectomy in Patients With Intermediate to High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

ARSB removes 4-sulfate groups from the nonreducing end of dermatan sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S), and its decreased expression has previously been reported to inhibit the activity of the ubiquitous protein-tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (SHP2 or PTPN11). However, the mechanism by which decline in ARSB leads to decline in SHP2 activity is unclear. Here, we show that SHP2 binds preferentially C4S, rather than chondroitin 6-sulfate, and confirm that SHP2 activity declines when ARSB is silenced. The reduction in ARSB activity, and the resultant increase in C4S, increased the expression of EGFR (Her1/ErbB1) in human prostate stem and epithelial cells. The increased expression of EGFR occurred after 1) the decline in SHP2 activity, 2) enhanced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, 3) increased nuclear DNA binding by c-Jun and c-Fos, and 4) EGFR promoter activation. In response to exogenous EGF, there was increased bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, consistent with enhanced cell proliferation. These findings indicated that ARSB and chondroitin 4-sulfation affect the activation of an important dual phosphorylation threonine-tyrosine kinase and the mRNA expression of a critical tyrosine kinase receptor in prostate cells. Restoration of ARSB activity with the associated reduction in C4S may provide a new therapeutic approach for managing malignancies in which EGFR-mediated tyrosine kinase signaling pathways are active.""","""['Sumit Bhattacharyya', 'Leo Feferman', 'Xiaorui Han', 'Yilan Ouyang', 'Fuming Zhang', 'Robert J Linhardt', 'Joanne K Tobacman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Profound Impact of Decline in N-Acetylgalactosamine-4-Sulfatase (Arylsulfatase B) on Molecular Pathophysiology and Human Diseases.', 'Inhibition of Phosphatase Activity Follows Decline in Sulfatase Activity and Leads to Transcriptional Effects through Sustained Phosphorylation of Transcription Factor MITF.', 'Decline in arylsulfatase B leads to increased invasiveness of melanoma cells.', 'Arylsulfatase B regulates versican expression by galectin-3 and AP-1 mediated transcriptional effects.', 'Structure, function, and pathogenesis of SHP2 in developmental disorders and tumorigenesis.', 'Profound Impact of Decline in N-Acetylgalactosamine-4-Sulfatase (Arylsulfatase B) on Molecular Pathophysiology and Human Diseases.', 'A comprehensive review of SHP2 and its role in cancer.', 'Heparan sulfates from bat and human lung and their binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus.', 'Specific Antiproliferative Properties of Proteinaceous Toxin Secretions from the Marine Annelid Eulalia sp. onto Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Increased CHST15 follows decline in arylsulfatase B (ARSB) and disinhibition of non-canonical WNT signaling: potential impact on epithelial and mesenchymal identity.']"""

Non-surgical stereotactic techniques are used to deliver similar doses to HDRB boost regimens with a dose escalation sub-study.  Methods:   Eligible patients have intermediate or high risk PC. PROMETHEUS explores the safety, efficacy and feasibility of multiple Australian centres cooperating in the delivery of Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) technology. A SBRT boost component Target Dose (TD) of 19Gy in two fractions is to be delivered, followed by a subsequent EBRT component of 46Gy in 23 fractions. Once accrual triggers have been met, SBRT doses can be escalated in 1 Gy increments to a maximum of 22Gy in two fractions. Patient safety will also be measured with the rate of both acute and late moderate to severe Gastro-Intestinal (GI) and Genito-Urinary (GU) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) toxicities as well as patient reported quality of life. Efficacy will be assessed via biochemical control after 3 years.

For metastatic prostate cancer (PCa), the bone marrow microenvironment influences metastasis, drug response, and possibly drug resistance.  Methods:   Using a novel microwell platform, the Microwell-mesh, we manufactured hundreds of 3D co-culture microtissues formed from PCa cells and bone marrow stromal cells. We used luciferase-expressing C42B PCa cells to enable quantification of the number of PCa cells in complex microtissue co-cultures. This strategy enabled us to quantify specific PCa cell growth and death in response to drug treatment, in different co-culture conditions. In parallel, we used Transwell migration assays to characterize PCa cell migration towards different 2D and 3D stromal cell populations.  Results:   Our results reveal that PCa cell migration varied depending on the relative aggressiveness of the PCa cell lines, the stromal cell composition, and stromal cell 2D or 3D geometry. We found that C42B cell sensitivity to Docetaxel varied depending on culture geometry, and the presence or absence of different stromal cell populations. By contrast, the C42B cell response to Abiraterone Acetate was dependent on geometry, but not on the presence or absence of stromal cells.  Conclusion:   In summary, stromal cell composition and geometry influences PCa cell migration, growth and drug response.

Hence, the development of effective cancer prevention strategies, as well as the discovery of novel therapeutic agents against cancer, is urgently required. In light of this challenge, this research aimed to evaluate the effects of several potent bioactive peptides and proteins contained in crocodile white blood cell extract (cWBC) against LU-1, LNCaP, PC-3, MCF-7, and CaCo-2 cancer cell lines. The results demonstrate that 25, 50, 100, and 200 μg/ml cWBC exhibits a strong cytotoxic effect against all investigated cell lines (IC₅₀ 70.34-101.0 μg/ml), while showing no signs of cytotoxicity towards noncancerous Vero and HaCaT cells. Specifically, cWBC treatment caused a significant reduction in the cancerous cells' colony forming ability. A remarkable suppression of cancerous cell migration was observed after treatment with cWBC, indicating potent antimetastatic properties. The mechanism involved in the cancer cell cytotoxicity of cWBC may be related to apoptosis induction, as evidenced by typical apoptotic morphology features. Moreover, certain cWBC concentrations induced significant overproduction of ROS and significantly inhibited the S-G₂/M transition in the cancer cell. The molecular mechanisms of cWBC in apoptosis induction were to decrease Bcl-2 and XIAP expression levels and increase the expression levels of caspase-3, caspase-8, and p53. These led to a decrease in the expression level of the cell cycle-associated gene cyclin-B1 and the arrest of cell population growth.

Soft tissue lesions, such as orthotopic prostate tumors, are difficult to identify using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging alone. In this study, we characterized a research magnetic resonance (MR) scanner for preclinical studies and created a protocol for combined MR-CBCT image-guided small animal radiotherapy. Two in-house dual-modality, MR and CBCT compatible, phantoms were designed and manufactured using 3D printing technology. The phantoms were used for quality assurance tests and to facilitate end-to-end testing for combined preclinical MR and CBCT based treatment planning. MR and CBCT images of the phantoms were acquired utilizing a Varian 4.7 T scanner and XRad-225Cx irradiator, respectively. The geometry distortion was assessed by comparing MR images to phantom blueprints and CBCT. The corrected MR scans were co-registered with CBCT and subsequently used for treatment planning. The fidelity of 3D printed phantoms compared to the blueprint design yielded favorable agreement as verified with the CBCT measurements.

This approach was tested for prostate cancer (PC) and head-and-neck cancer (HNC) cases.  Methods:   The constraints of a previously optimized volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan were used as a template for automatic plan reoptimization for different accelerator head models. All plans were generated using the treatment planning system (TPS) Hyperion. Automatic replanning was performed for 16 PC cases, initially planned for MLC1 (4 mm MLC) and reoptimized for MLC2 (5 mm) and MLC3 (10 mm) and for 19 HNC cases, replanned from MLC2 to MLC3. EUD, Dmean, D2%, and D98% were evaluated for targets; for OARs EUD and D2% were analyzed. Replanning was considered successful if both plans fulfilled equal constraints.  Results:   All prostate cases were successfully replanned. The mean relative target EUD deviation was -0.15% and -0.57% for replanning to MLC2 and MLC3, respectively. OAR sparing was successful in all cases. Replanning of HNC cases from MLC2 to MLC3 was successful in 16/19 patients with a mean decrease of -0.64% in PTV60 EUD. In three cases target doses were substantially decreased by up to -2.58% (PTV60) and -3.44% (PTV54), respectively. Nevertheless, OAR sparing was always achieved as planned.

The molecular mechanisms of radiation resistance are being elucidated through the study of microRNA (miR) that negatively regulate gene expression. We performed bioinformatics analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset to evaluate the association between miR-106a and its putative target lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α factor (LITAF) in prostate cancer. We characterized the function of miR-106a through in vitro and in vivo experiments and employed transcriptomic analysis, western blotting, and 3'UTR luciferase assays to establish LITAF as a bona fide target of miR-106a. Using our well-characterized radiation-resistant cell lines, we identified that miR-106a was overexpressed in radiation-resistant cells compared to parental cells. In the TCGA, miR-106a was significantly elevated in high-grade human prostate tumors relative to intermediate- and low-grade specimens. An inverse correlation was seen with its target, LITAF. Furthermore, high miR-106a and low LITAF expression predict for biochemical recurrence at 5 years after radical prostatectomy. miR-106a overexpression conferred radioresistance by increasing proliferation and reducing senescence, and this was phenocopied by knockdown of LITAF. For the first time, we describe a role for miRNA in upregulating ATM expression. LITAF, not previously attributed to radiation response, mediates this interaction. This route of cancer radioresistance can be overcome using the specific ATM kinase inhibitor, KU-55933. Our research provides the first report of miR-106a and LITAF in prostate cancer radiation resistance and high-grade disease, and presents a viable therapeutic strategy that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.""","""['Christianne Hoey', 'Jessica Ray', 'Jouhyun Jeon', 'Xiaoyong Huang', 'Samira Taeb', 'Jarkko Ylanko', 'David W Andrews', 'Paul C Boutros', 'Stanley K Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Estrogen receptor α regulates ATM Expression through miRNAs in breast cancer.', 'MiR-301a regulates E-cadherin expression and is predictive of prostate cancer recurrence.', 'miR-203 induces oxaliplatin resistance in colorectal cancer cells by negatively regulating ATM kinase.', 'microRNAs identified in prostate cancer: Correlative studies on response to ionizing radiation.', 'MicroRNAs in Prostate Cancer Following Radiotherapy: Towards Predicting Response to Radiation Treatment.', 'LITAF inhibits colorectal cancer stemness and metastatic behavior by regulating FOXO1-mediated SIRT1 expression.', 'Application of Gold Nanoparticles as Radiosensitizer for Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Drivers of Radioresistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'A cellular senescence-related gene prognostic index for biochemical recurrence and drug resistance in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.']"""

In the current study, the effect and mechanism of matrine on cell apoptosis, viability, migration and invasion of human prostate cancer cells in vivo and in vitro through the unfolded protein response (UPR)/ER stress pathway were investigated. Matrine inhibited proteasomal chymotrypsin‑like (CT‑like) activity in the prostate carcinoma cellular proteasome.

In vitro analyses showed that matrine repressed cell motility, viability and invasion, arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis. Furthermore, matrine activated the UPR/ER stress signaling cascade in prostate cancer cells and tumor tissues of xenograft‑bearing nude mice. Results also demonstrated that the anti‑apoptotic protein Bcl‑2 was downregulated, the pro‑apoptotic protein Bak was upregulated and the cell growth and cell cycle‑related proteins c‑Myc, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1 and CDK1 were downregulated.

Recent studies have shown increased MAOA expression in prostate cancer (PCa), glioma, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. However, the biological function of MAOA in cancer development remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of MAOA in the development of prostate adenocarcinoma by creating a prostate-specific Pten/MAOA knockout (KO) mouse model, in which MAOA-floxP mouse was crossed with the conditional Pten KO PCa mouse that develops invasive PCa. In contrast to Pten KO mice, age-matched Pten/MAOA KO mice exhibited a significant decrease in both prostate size and the incidence of invasive cancer. We observed a significant decline in AKT phosphorylation and Ki67 expression in Pten/MAOA KO mice, which reduced epithelial cell growth and proliferation. As cancer stem cells (CSCs) are required for tumor initiation and growth, we investigated expression of OCT4 and NANOG in the setting of decreased MAOA expression. We found that both OCT4 and NANOG were significantly attenuated in the prostate epithelia of Pten/MAOA KO mice compared to Pten KO mice, which was confirmed with targeted knockdown of MAOA with a short-hairpin(sh) vector targeting MAOA compared to cells transfected with a control vector. Expression of other markers associated with the a stem cell phenotype, including CD44, α2β1, and CD133 as well as HIF-1α+CD44+ stem cells were all decreased in shMAOA PCa cells compared with empty vector-transfected control cells. We also found spheroid formation ability in PCa cells was decreased when endogenous MAOA was suppressed by siRNA or MAOA inhibitor clorgyline in a colony formation assay. Using the TCGA database, elevated MAOA expression was associated with reduced Pten levels in high Gleason grade in patient samples. Further, we found that Pten-positive PCa cells were more resistant to clorgyline treatments than Pten-null cells in tumorigenicity and stemness. Taken together, these studies suggest that MAOA expression promotes PCa development by increasing cell proliferation and CSCs and highlights the potential use of MAOA inhibitors for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Chun-Peng Liao', 'Tzu-Ping Lin', 'Pei-Chuan Li', 'Lauren A Geary', 'Kevin Chen', 'Vijaya Pooja Vaikari', 'Jason Boyang Wu', 'Chi-Hung Lin', 'Mitchell E Gross', 'Jean C Shih']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Dual inhibition of survivin and MAOA synergistically impairs growth of PTEN-negative prostate cancer.', 'Monoamine oxidase A mediates prostate tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis.', 'Targeting monoamine oxidase A in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA): A promising target for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Cellular prostatic acid phosphatase, a PTEN-functional homologue in prostate epithelia, functions as a prostate-specific tumor suppressor.', 'Design, synthesis, and biological activity of dual monoamine oxidase A and heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, N-Methylpropargylamine-conjugated 4-isopropylresorcinol for glioblastoma.', 'Constructing a novel mitochondrial-related gene signature for evaluating the tumor immune microenvironment and predicting survival in stomach adenocarcinoma.', 'Monoamine oxidase A: An emerging therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'Maternal prebiotic supplementation impacts colitis development in offspring mice.', 'In Vitro and In Vivo Assays Characterizing MAO A Function in Cancers.']"""

Remarkably, we find dramatic differences in AR-V7 cistromes across diverse CRPC cells and patient tissues, regulating different target gene sets involved in CRPC progression. Surprisingly, we discover that HoxB13 is universally required for and colocalizes with AR-V7 binding to open chromatin across CRPC genomes. HoxB13 pioneers AR-V7 binding through direct physical interaction, and collaborates with AR-V7 to up-regulate target oncogenes. Transcriptional coregulation by HoxB13 and AR-V7 was further supported by their coexpression in tumors and circulating tumor cells from CRPC patients. Importantly, HoxB13 silencing significantly decreases CRPC growth through inhibition of AR-V7 oncogenic function.

ERG directly suppressed expression of cell cycle-related genes, which induced RB hypophosphorylation and repressed E2F1-mediated expression of mesenchymal lineage regulators, thereby restricting adenocarcinoma plasticity and maintaining antiandrogen sensitivity. In ERG-negative tumors, CDK4/6 inhibition delayed tumor growth.Conclusions: Our studies identify a previously undefined function of ERG to restrict lineage plasticity and maintain antiandrogen sensitivity in PTEN/TP53-altered prostate cancer. Our findings suggest ERG fusion as a biomarker to guide treatment of PTEN/TP53-altered, RB1-intact prostate cancer.

Results:   Thirty-four patients received abiraterone and 32 received enzalutamide after treatment with second-line flutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Prostate-specific antigen-progression-free survival during treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide was the endpoint. The response to flutamide therapy was defined as any decrease in prostate-specific antigen compared to baseline prostate-specific antigen. Among the abiraterone-treated patients, those for whom flutamide after bicalutamide was effective showed significantly lower prostate-specific antigen changes than those for whom it was ineffective (P = 0.0175). Prostate-specific antigen-progression-free survival was significantly higher in the abiraterone patients when flutamide was effective than in the patients when it was ineffective (P = 0.027).

Results:   The current study, for the first time, found that KLF13 was downregulated in prostate tumor tissues as compared to the paired non-tumor tissues. The overexpression of KLF13 dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by suppressing the AKT pathway in human prostate cancer cells. Moreover, the ectopic expression of KLF13 efficiently delayed the onset of PC3 xenografts and inhibited the tumor growth in vivo.

This study aimed to validate the 6-item Cancer Worry Scale (CWS) and to establish a cut-off score for high FCR.  Methods:   Participants in this study were 1033 cancer survivors and patients recruited as part of 5 existing studies on FCR involving patients and survivors with gastro-intestinal stromal tumors, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer. De-identified data of the CWS, Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI), Impact of Event Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and EORTC-QLQ-C30 were amalgamated for the analyses. Confirmatory factor analysis of the CWS was performed. Sensitivity and specificity were tested with the FCRI as gold standard.  Results:   Results confirmed that the 6-item version of the CWS maintained good construct validity, convergent and divergent validity, and high internal consistency (α 0.90).

However, their effectivity is limited by drug resistance. The nucleoside transport capability of tumour cells is considered to be a determinant of the clinical outcome of treatment regimens using antimetabolites. Due to hydrophilic properties of antimetabolites, their transport across the plasma membrane is mediated by two families of transmembrane proteins, the SLC28 family of cation-linked concentrative nucleoside transporters (hCNTs) and SLC29 family of energy-independent equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hENTs). Loss of functional nucleoside transporters has been associated with reduced efficacy of antimetabolites and their derivatives and treatment failure in diverse malignancies including solid tumours, such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  Material and methods:   The effectivity and kinetics of antimetabolite uptake were analysed using control and docetaxel-resistant PC3 cells. For this purpose, fluorescent nucleoside analogue probe uridine-furane and inhibitor of nucleoside transporters, S-(4-nitrobenzyl) -6-thioinosine were exploited. Combination of flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction methodology were used for the analysis.  Results:   Here we utilized flow cytometric assay for analysis of nucleoside transporters activity employing fluorescent nucleoside analogue, uridine-furane. We have determined the long-time kinetics of uridine-furane incorporation and quantified its levels in the parental prostate cancer cell line PC3 and its chemoresistant derivative. Finally, we have shown an association between the activity and mRNA expression of nucleoside transporters and sensitivity to various nucleoside analogues.

Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is the main driver of prostate cancer (PCa) progression, and stromal cells in the TME also express AR. High-grade tumor and poor clinical outcome are associated with low AR expression in the TME, which suggests a protective role of AR signaling in the stroma against PCa development. However, the mechanism of this relation is not clear. In this study, we isolated AR-expressing CAF-like cells. Testosterone (R1881) exposure did not affect CAF-like cell morphology, proliferation, or motility. PCa cell growth was not affected by culturing in medium from R1881-exposed CAF-like cells; however, migration of PCa cells was inhibited. AR chromatin immune precipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed and motif search suggested that AR in CAF-like cells bound the chromatin through AP-1-elements upon R1881 exposure, inducing enhancer-mediated AR chromatin interactions. The vast majority of chromatin binding sites in CAF-like cells were unique and not shared with AR sites observed in PCa cell lines or tumors.

The median time from first diagnosis to mCRPC was 88 months; the median age was 78 years with a median baseline serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 341 ng/ml. With a median follow-up of 16.4 months, progression-free survival (PFS) was 71, 64, and 43% after 2, 4, and 6 months, respectively. Median OS was 8.1 months. No relevant adverse events occurred.

More recently, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has had promising implications for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. We aim to investigate the diagnostic role of mpMRI in predicting the future diagnosis of prostate cancer in patients with an initial negative biopsy.  Methods:   This study included all men with negative biopsies, elevated PSA and mpMRI. All patients had their age, PSA, and PSAd recorded. mpMRI lesions were classified using the PI-RADS 2 scoring system.  Results:   mpMRI imaging was performed in 336 men with an initial negative biopsy, of whom 108, 111, 76 and 41 men underwent single, two, three and four biopsies, respectively. Of the 228 men with more than one biopsy, 115 patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer on further biopsies. Older patients and men with higher PSA, PSAd and PIRADS score had a significant risk to progress to cancer but only higher PSAd and higher PI-RADS score were significantly associated with clinically significant cancers. For clinically significant cancer; sensitivity and specificity of PI-RADS scoring was 86 and 45%, respectively, and a NPV of 87.6%. When combined with PSAd, NPV was 93%.  Conclusion:   Men with benign prostatic biopsy and both PSAd < 0.15 and low PI-RADS score may avoid second biopsy. PI-RADS scoring system has a high sensitivity to diagnose clinically significant prostate cancer and repeat biopsy should be recommended in men with benign biopsy and high score.""","""['Ahmed Fouad Kotb', 'Shelley Spaner', 'Trafford Crump', 'Matthew Eric Hyndman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Characterizing indeterminate (Likert-score 3/5) peripheral zone prostate lesions with PSA density, PI-RADS scoring and qualitative descriptors on multiparametric MRI.', 'Combination of prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density predicts biopsy outcome in prostate biopsy naïve patients.', 'The Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Follow-up of Patients Included in Active Surveillance Protocol.

However, the effect of SRT on long-term clinical outcomes remains unknown. Therefore, we report the natural history of patients treated with SRT.  Methods:   We identified 84 Chinese patients with prostate cancer treated with SRT to the prostatic fossa alone during 2006-2017 at Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong. Survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test and Cox regression were used to determine significance of clinical parameters with outcomes.  Results:   Median SRT dose given was 70 Gy (range, 64-76 Gy). Median pre-SRT PSA level was 0.4 ng/mL (0.2-7.4 ng/mL). After SRT, 47 (56%) patients had undetectable (<0.1 ng/mL) PSA levels. After median follow-up of 48 months (2 months to 10 years), 25 (30%) patients had further biochemical progression. Subsequently, 12 patients received androgen deprivation therapy and nine (11%) developed distant metastasis. The 5-year biochemical progression-free survival, androgen deprivation therapy-free survival and metastasis-free survival were 62.7%, 83.5% and 86.7%, respectively. Early PSA failure after radical prostatectomy (hazard ratio 7.4), negative surgical margin (hazard ratio 2.7), positive extracapsular extension (hazard ratio 4.6), and detectable PSA levels after SRT (hazard ratio 17.3) were associated with lower biochemical progression-free survival after SRT.  Conclusions:   High-dose SRT with intensity-modulated radiotherapy/volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy is an effective local treatment that can prevent distant metastasis and avoid the need for androgen deprivation therapy in Chinese patients who have PSA failure after radical prostatectomy.""","""['E K Lee', 'W H Mui', 'A W Chan', 'Y Tung', 'F C Wong']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Hong Kong Med J""","""['Long-term outcomes after high-dose postprostatectomy salvage radiation treatment.', 'Use of Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients Treated with Early Salvage Radiotherapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: Long-term Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Series.', 'Prostate-specific antigen after salvage radiotherapy for postprostatectomy biochemical recurrence predicts long-term outcome including overall survival.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'The timing of salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.', 'Prospective comparison of whole-body MRI and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for the detection of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.']"""

We aimed to identify potential relationships between dose and toxicity using conventional dose-volume histograms (DVHs) and dose-surface maps (DSMs).  Materials and methods:   Urinary bladder trigone and rectum DSMs were produced for a single-institution service evaluation cohort of 50 patients receiving SBRT for localised prostate cancer, together with conventional DVHs for bladder and rectum. Patients had been prospectively recruited to this cohort and treated according to a pre-defined protocol to a dose of 36.25 Gy in five fractions. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) toxicity data were recorded prospectively. Logistic regression was used to identify dosimetric predictors of acute IPSS+10 (rise of 10 points or more above baseline) and grade 2+ RTOG toxicity.  Results:   On univariate analysis, trigone area receiving 40 Gy and trigone Dmax were associated with IPSS+10 (odds ratio 1.06 [1.02-1.11], P = 0.007 and odds ratio 1.54 [1.06-2.25], P = 0.024, respectively). These two variables were highly correlated. In a multivariate model, including all baseline variables, trigone Dmax remained associated with IPSS+10 (odds ratio 1.91 [1.13-3.22], P = 0.016). These findings were not significant with Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (corrected P value threshold 0.006). No associations were seen between rectal toxicity and DVH or DSM parameters.

While immunotherapies and vaccines have shown great promise, particularly in certain solid tumors such as prostate cancer, they have been met with resistance from tumors that use a multitude of mechanisms of immunosuppression to limit effectiveness. Prostate cancer, in particular, secretes transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) as a means to inhibit immunity while allowing for cancer progression. Blocking TGF-β signaling in T cells increases their ability to infiltrate, proliferate, and mediate antitumor responses in prostate cancer models. We tested whether the potency of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells directed to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) could be enhanced by the co-expression of a dominant-negative TGF-βRII (dnTGF-βRII). Upon expression of the dominant-negative TGF-βRII in CAR T cells, we observed increased proliferation of these lymphocytes, enhanced cytokine secretion, resistance to exhaustion, long-term in vivo persistence, and the induction of tumor eradication in aggressive human prostate cancer mouse models.

Among the different genome-wide DNA methylation technologies, whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) is considered the gold standard for assaying genome-wide DNA methylation at single base resolution. However, the high sequencing cost to achieve the optimal depth of coverage limits its application in both basic and clinical research. To achieve 15× coverage of the human methylome, using WGBS, requires approximately three lanes of 100-bp-paired-end Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing. It is important, therefore, for advances in sequencing technologies to be developed to enable cost-effective high-coverage sequencing.  Results:   In this study, we provide an optimised WGBS methodology, from library preparation to sequencing and data processing, to enable 16-20× genome-wide coverage per single lane of HiSeq X Ten, HCS 3.3.76. To process and analyse the data, we developed a WGBS pipeline (METH10X) that is fast and can call SNPs. We performed WGBS on both high-quality intact DNA and degraded DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. First, we compared different library preparation methods on the HiSeq 2500 platform to identify the best method for sequencing on the HiSeq X Ten. Second, we optimised the PhiX and genome spike-ins to achieve higher quality and coverage of WGBS data on the HiSeq X Ten. Third, we performed integrated whole genome sequencing (WGS) and WGBS of the same DNA sample in a single lane of HiSeq X Ten to improve data output. Finally, we compared methylation data from the HiSeq 2500 and HiSeq X Ten and found high concordance (Pearson r > 0.9×).  Conclusions:   Together we provide a systematic, efficient and complete approach to perform and analyse WGBS on the HiSeq X Ten.

In this study, several series of novel hydroxamic acids incorporating 1-((1H- 1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)-3-substituted-2-oxoindolines were explored.  Methods:   The compounds were designed using Autodock Vina program, then synthesized and evaluated in vitro and in silico for their inhibitory activity against HDACs. The cytotoxicity was measured by SRB method. The enzyme inhibitory effects of the compounds were evaluated by the fluorescent assay.  Results:   Biological evaluation showed that these hydroxamic acids were generally cytotoxic against four human cancer cell lines (SW620, colon; PC-3, prostate; AsPC-1, pancreas; NCI-H23, lung). Several compounds, e.g. 7g, 11c, and 11g, displayed up to 10-fold more potent than SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, vorinostat) in term of cytotoxicity. The synthesized compounds were also comparably potent to SAHA in inhibiting HDAC2. In particular, compound 11c displayed potential inhibitory effects against HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC6, and HDAC8 with comparable or slightly higher potency than SAHA. Docking results on four class I and IIB isoenzymes indicated that these compounds tightly bound to HDACs at the active site with binding affinities much higher than that of SAHA. Finally, chemo-informatics approaches were employed to assess the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles of 7g and 11c. We identified degradation via phase II metabolism and toxicity two of the most serious problems that need further optimization.

Patients who lived in communities with a greater percentage of high school degrees had higher odds of receiving palliative care; Central and Pacific regions of the United States had lower odds of palliative care use than the East Coast. Patients with colon, melanoma, or prostate cancer had lower odds of palliative care than patients with breast cancer, whereas those with lung cancer had higher odds.  Conclusions:   Palliative care use in solid cancer tumors is variable, with a preference for patients with lung cancer, younger age, known insurance status, and higher educational level.""","""['Osayande Osagiede', 'Dorin T Colibaseanu', 'Aaron C Spaulding', 'Ryan D Frank', 'Amit Merchea', 'Scott R Kelley', 'Ryan J Uitti', 'Sikander Ailawadhi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Palliat Care""","""['The Determinants of Palliative Care Use in Patients With Colorectal Cancer: A National Study.', 'Palliative Care Utilization in Nontraumatic Intracerebral Hemorrhage in the United States.', 'Predictors of palliative treatment in stage IV colorectal cancer.', 'Palliative systemic therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Investigating disparities between patients who are treated versus those who are not.', 'Utilization of Palliative Care in Osteosarcoma: A National Cancer Database Review.', 'Use of Palliative Interventions at End of Life for Advanced Gastrointestinal Cancer.', 'Survival of Black and White Patients With Stage IV Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Health Care Access Measures and Palliative Care Use by Race/Ethnicity among Metastatic Gynecological Cancer Patients in the United States.', 'A framework for making predictive models useful in practice.', 'Racial and ethnic disparities in palliative care utilization among gynecological cancer patients.']"""

However, the detailed mechanism underlying PPI, particularly in enhancing the effect of the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide in controlling castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has not been explored.  Methods:   Cell viability and cell cycle distribution were measured using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) expression was measured by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR). Western blot analysis was performed to determine the protein expression levels of MUC1, p65, and p50. Silencing of HOTAIR was evaluated using the siRNA procedure. The promoter activity of the MUC1 gene was determined using Secrete-Pair Dual Luminescence Assay Kit. Exogenous expression of HOTAIR, p65, and MUC1 was conducted by transient transfection assay. A xenograft tumor model in nude mice was used to further evaluate the effect of the combination of PPI and enzalutamide in vivo.  Results:   We showed that PPI significantly inhibited growth and induced cell cycle arrest in CRPC cells. PPI also decreased p65 and MUC1 protein expression and reduced HOTAIR expression. Exogenously expressed p65 resisted the PPI-inhibited expression of HOTAIR, whereas silenced HOTAIR reduced MUC1 protein but exerted no effect on the expression of p65 and p50 proteins. Conversely, exogenously expressed HOTAIR resisted the PPI-inhibited MUC1 protein expression, and excessive expression of MUC1 antagonized the PPI-inhibited cell growth. Notably, PPI combined with enzalutamide exerted a synergistic effect. Consistent with this finding, PPI inhibited tumor growth, HOTAIR expression, as well as p65 and MUC1 protein expressions in vivo.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that PPI inhibits the growth of CRPC cells by inhibiting p65 protein and concomitantly reducing HOTAIR expression, thereby suppressing MUC1 gene expression. The novel regulatory interaction of p65 and HOTAIR converge in the inhibition of MUC1 expression and overall PPI response. The combination of PPI and enzalutamide exhibits synergy. This study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the synergistic inhibitory effect of PPI and enzalutamide on the growth of CRPC cells.""","""['SongTao Xiang', 'PeiLiang Zou', 'JingJing Wu', 'Fang Zheng', 'Qing Tang', 'Jianfu Zhou', 'Swei Sunny Hann']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['HOTAIR-mediated reciprocal regulation of EZH2 and DNMT1 contribute to polyphyllin I-inhibited growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Repression of PDK1- and LncRNA HOTAIR-Mediated EZH2 Gene Expression Contributes to the Enhancement of Atractylenolide 1 and Erlotinib in the Inhibition of Human Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Inhibition of EZH2 via activation of SAPK/JNK and reduction of p65 and DNMT1 as a novel mechanism in inhibition of human lung cancer cells by polyphyllin I.', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.', 'HOTAIR beyond repression: In protein degradation, inflammation, DNA damage response, and cell signaling.', 'Therapeutic effects on cancer of the active ingredients in rhizoma paridis.', 'Novel insights into the roles and therapeutic implications of MUC1 oncoprotein via regulating proteins and non-coding RNAs in cancer.', 'Solamargine inhibits the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma and enhances the anticancer effect of sorafenib by regulating HOTTIP-TUG1/miR-4726-5p/MUC1 pathway.', 'Targeting Inflammatory Signaling in Prostate Cancer Castration Resistance.', 'LncRNA-CR11538 Decoys Dif/Dorsal to Reduce Antimicrobial Peptide Products for Restoring Drosophila Toll Immunity Homeostasis.']"""

A luciferase reporter assay and a rescue assay were performed, which identified ADAM metalloproteinase domain 9 (ADAM9) as the target gene of miR-126. Subsequently, Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses were used to investigate the association between ADAM9 expression and PCa prognosis. The results revealed that miR-126 expression was significantly downregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines. miR-126 overexpression was demonstrated to reduce PCa cell proliferation and metastasis, and to reverse the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process in vitro. In addition, as the target gene of miR-126, the upregulation of ADAM9 reestablished cell functions, including cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Patients with high ADAM9 expression levels exhibited a shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival time.

SDC exhibits biological similarity to prostate and breast cancers, therefore anti-hormone therapy and molecular target therapies are available, however with limited beneficial effects. Galanin and galanin receptors (GALRs) are well established as molecular biomarkers to predict the survival rate and risk of recurrence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The present study investigated the clinicopathological features of patients with SDC and the methylation status of their galanin and GALR genes to demonstrate the prognostic value for this disease.

Using bioinformatics analysis, miR-206 was identified as the most promising candidate miRNA that targeted ANXA2. Prostate tissue specimens from 60 patients with prostate cancer, 30 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and 20 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were examined for ANXA2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry and western blotting and for miR-206 expression by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, human prostate cancer PC-3 cells were transfected with miR-206 mimics, miR-206 inhibitors or a negative control sequence, and expression of ANXA2, E-cadherin and N-cadherin was detected by western blotting. Transwell assays were performed to determine the effect of altered miR-206 expression on the invasive behavior of PC-3 cells. Bioinformatics analysis predicted complementary binding between miR-206 and ANXA2 mRNA. ANXA2 protein expression was detected in a significantly higher proportion of BPH tissues (95%, 19/20) when compared with prostate cancer tissues (51.7%, 31/60; P<0.05). Similarly, ANXA2 was expressed in a significantly higher proportion of metastatic prostate cancer samples than that of prostate cancer samples (P<0.05). Expression of miR-206 was higher than that of ANXA2 in prostate cancer samples, but lower in BPH samples. Inhibition of miR-206 expression in PC-3 cells upregulated ANXA2 and E-cadherin protein expression levels, downregulated N-cadherin and vimentin, and promoted cell invasion in vitro. These data suggested that binding between miRNA-206 and ANXA2 mRNA may regulate EMT signaling, thereby suppressing the invasion and metastasis of prostatic cancer cells.""","""['Ning Yang', 'Ling Wang', 'Jun Liu', 'Li Liu', 'Jiangbo Huang', 'Xian Chen', 'Zhigang Luo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'Effects of MicroRNA-206 on Osteosarcoma Cell Proliferation, Apoptosis, Migration and Invasion by Targeting ANXA2 Through the AKT Signaling Pathway.', 'lncRNA LINC00460 Silencing Represses EMT in Colon Cancer through Downregulation of ANXA2 via Upregulating miR-433-3p.', 'MicroRNA-183 in Cancer Progression.', 'Advances in cancer treatment: a new therapeutic target, Annexin A2.', 'Probable Mechanisms of Doxorubicin Antitumor Activity Enhancement by Ginsenoside Rh2.', 'Curcumin Regulates Cancer Progression: Focus on ncRNAs and Molecular Signaling Pathways.', 'Differential CircRNA Expression Signatures May Serve as Potential Novel Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer.', 'MicroRNA-206 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells by regulating the c-Met/AKT/GSK-3β pathway.', 'Butylphthalide Inhibits Autophagy and Promotes Multiterritory Perforator Flap Survival.']"""

Urodynamic studies were conducted at baseline as well as at 1 and 3 months post-operatively. Early recovery of urinary continence was defined as no urine leakage or only one pad/day used within 3 months after surgery. Demographic characteristics, changes in urodynamic parameters, and continence outcomes were analyzed.  Results:   Overall rate of early recovery of urinary continence was 33.3%. Patients with higher bladder neck levels experienced a significantly earlier recovery of urinary continence in univariate analysis (77.8%, 29.2%, and 13.3% for bladder neck levels 0, -1, and -2, respectively, p = 0.004).

Patients and methods:   In all, 1 090 mpMRIs were performed between July 2013 and April 2016 in biopsy-naïve men with an abnormal prostate-specific antigen level and/or digital rectal examination. Data were collected from patient records at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust. mpMRI Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores were compared to transperineal or transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy findings as the reference standard. csPCa was defined as Gleason score of ≥3+4. The diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI was also assessed.  Results:   The mpMRI was interpretable in 1 023 men and 792 underwent biopsy, of which 106 were transperineal. The median number of cores taken in transperineal and TRUS-guided biopsy were 10 and 6, respectively. The detection rate of csPCa was 37%; csPCa rose from 15% of PI-RADS 1 and 2 to 86% of PI-RADS 5. The sensitivity, negative predictive value, specificity, and positive predictive value were 82%, 85%, 59% and 54%, respectively. The study is limited by its retrospective nature and lack of reporting of follow-up for 'missed cancers'. Men with low mpMRI PI-RADS were also less likely to undergo biopsy. Whilst this selection bias may overestimate the detection rate of csPCa, this reflects the shared decisions patients and clinicians make in day-to-day practice outside of research centres.  Conclusion:   In a routine clinical setting, the higher the mpMRI PI-RADS, the greater the detection rate of csPCa in biopsy-naïve men. A normal mpMRI does not exclude csPCa; however, mpMRI may have utility in informing shared-decision making on whether to proceed to biopsy and subsequent treatment.""","""['Vanessa C Otti', 'Catherine Miller', 'Roy J Powell', 'Richard M Thomas', 'John S McGrath']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Association Between Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Score for the Index Lesion and Multifocal, Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Not All Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsies Are Equal: The Impact of the Type of Approach and Operator Expertise on the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Head-to-head Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Prostate Biopsy Versus Multiparametric Prostate Resonance Imaging with Subsequent Magnetic Resonance-guided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men with Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen: A Large Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

Prostate needle core biopsies performed between 2008 and 2014 were reviewed. Patients with at least 1 subsequent biopsy were identified. Cases were categorized by worst initial diagnosis. Gleason ≤6 carcinoma was further classified as significant or insignificant with insignificant defined as follows: ≤2 cores with carcinoma, sites with ≤50% carcinoma, and unilateral carcinoma. A total of 329 men underwent repeat biopsies. Gleason ≤6 insignificant carcinoma, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and/or atypical small acinar proliferation, and negative biopsies had a similar rate of Gleason ≥7 upon repeat biopsy (16%, 17%, 14%; P = .91). Initial biopsy diagnoses of Gleason ≤6 significant carcinoma had a higher rate of Gleason ≥7 on repeat biopsy compared with initial biopsies of Gleason ≤6 insignificant carcinoma (39%, 16%; P = .003). Within initial diagnoses of Gleason ≤6, 1 core compared with more than 1 core positive had a lower rate of Gleason ≥7 on repeat biopsy (17%, 30%), although this difference was not significant (P = .08). An initial biopsy diagnosed as Gleason ≤6 insignificant carcinoma, HGPIN and/or atypical small acinar proliferation, or negative had a similar substantial risk of Gleason ≥7 carcinoma upon subsequent biopsy. Our findings support the continued stratification of Gleason ≤6 and thus the diagnostic workup of all atypical foci to provide an accurate, thorough number of involved cores.""","""['Saranya Prathibha', 'Kashika G Goyal', 'Debra L Zynger']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Repeat Prostate Biopsy Practice Patterns in a Statewide Quality Improvement Collaborative.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', 'Repeat biopsy strategy in patients with atypical small acinar proliferation or high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on initial prostate needle biopsy.', 'Incidence of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer After a Diagnosis of Atypical Small Acinar Proliferation, High-grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia, or Benign Tissue.', 'Widespread high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on prostatic needle biopsy: a significant likelihood of subsequently diagnosed adenocarcinoma.', 'Artificial intelligence-assisted cancer diagnosis improves the efficiency of pathologists in prostatic biopsies.', 'A high high-density lipoprotein level is associated with Gleason score upgrade in Chinese patients diagnosed with high-grade prostate carcinoma.', 'Clinical strategy of repeat biopsy in patients with atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP).']"""

This has led to intense interest in developing compounds capable of modulating the synthesis of steroid hormones. Compounds capable of inhibiting Cyp19 (Aromatase), a key enzyme in the synthesis of estrogens, have been successfully employed as breast cancer therapies, while inhibitors of Cyp17 (17α-hydroxylase-17,20-lyase), a key enzyme in the synthesis of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and steroidal sex hormones, are a key component of prostate cancer therapy. Inhibition of CYP17 has also been suggested as a possible target for the treatment of Cushing Syndrome and Metabolic Syndrome. We have identified two novel series of stilbene based CYP17 inhibitors and demonstrated that exemplary compounds in these series have pharmacokinetic properties consistent with orally delivered drugs.

Recent studies demonstrate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in many aspects of PCa. However, their biological roles in PCa remain imperfectly understood. Here,wecharacterized anlncRNA, PCaspecific expression and EZH2-associatedtranscript (PCSEAT, annotated as PRCAT38), which is specifically overexpressedin PCa. We further demonstrated that knockdown of PCSEAT results in the reduction of PCa cell growth and motility, and overexpression of PCSEAT reverses these phenotypes. Furthermore, bioactive PCSEAT is incorporated into exosomes and transmitted to adjacent cells, thus promoting cell proliferation and motility. Mechanistically, we found that PCSEAT promotes cell proliferation, at least in part by affecting miR-143-3p- and miR-24-2-5p-mediated regulation of EZH2, suggesting that PCSEAT and EZH2 competitively 'sponge' miR-143-3p and miR-24-2-5p.Overall, ourresultsrevealthat PCSEAT is specifically overexpressed in PCa patients and a potential oncogene in PCa cells via mediating EZH2 activity, indicating that PCSEAT may be a potential therapeutic target in PCa.""","""['Xiaohui Yang', 'Liang Wang', 'Rong Li', 'Yuhui Zhao', 'Yinmin Gu', 'Siying Liu', 'Tianyou Cheng', 'Kuohsiang Huang', 'Yi Yuan', 'Dalong Song', 'Shan Gao']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA MYU promotes prostate cancer proliferation by mediating the miR-184/c-Myc axis.', 'Regulation of HOXA11-AS/miR-214-3p/EZH2 axis on the growth, migration and invasion of glioma cells.', 'EZH2 in Cancer Progression and Potential Application in Cancer Therapy: A Friend or Foe?', 'Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 460: Review of its role in carcinogenesis.', 'The diagnostic role and mechanistic functions of exosomal lncRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'DMDRMR promotes angiogenesis via antagonizing DAB2IP in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Molecular functions and therapeutic applications of exosomal noncoding RNAs in cancer.', 'Crosstalk between Long Non Coding RNAs, microRNAs and DNA Damage Repair in Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities?']"""

To clarify the clinical relevance of HSD3B2 expression in prostate cancer, we analyzed HSD3B2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry on our preexisting tissue microarray with 12.247 annotated cancers. Compared with normal tissue cytoplasmic HSD3B2 staining was stronger in prostate cancers. In 9371 interpretable cancers, HSD3B2 expression was found in 95.5% of cancers and was considered weak in 29.9%, moderate in 40.7% and strong in 24.9%. HSD3B2 up regulation was linked to advanced pathological tumor stage (pT), high Gleason grade, elevated preoperative PSA levels (p < 0.0001 each), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0019), accelerated cell proliferation (p < 0.0001), androgen receptor (AR) expression (p < 0.0001), and early biochemical recurrence (p < 0.0001). HSD3B2 up regulation was only marginally more frequent in ERG positive (98%) than in ERG negative cancers (94%; p < 0.0001) and was strongly linked to deletions of 5q and 6q (p < 0.0001 each). Multivariate analyses showed that the prognostic impact of HSD3B2 expression was independent of established preoperative, but not of postoperative prognostic parameters. In summary, the results of our study demonstrate that HSD3B2 is strongly up regulated in a fraction of prostate cancers that are characterized by increased AR signaling, adverse tumor phenotype and early biochemical recurrence.""","""['Emily Neubauer', 'Morwari Latif', 'Jenny Krause', 'Asmus Heumann', 'Moritz Armbrust', 'Clara Luehr', 'Christoph Fraune', 'Claudia Hube-Magg', 'Martina Kluth', 'Christina Möller-Koop', 'Guido Sauter', 'Ronald Simon', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Raisa S Pompe', 'Imke Thederan', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Franziska Büscheck']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Exp Mol Pathol""","""['HOXB13 overexpression is an independent predictor of early PSA recurrence in prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'FOXA1 expression is a strong independent predictor of early PSA recurrence in ERG negative prostate cancers treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'The prognostic value of SUMO1/Sentrin specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) in prostate cancer is limited to ERG-fusion positive tumors lacking PTEN deletion.', 'Overexpression of the A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase ADAM15 is linked to a Small but Highly Aggressive Subset of Prostate Cancers.', 'Down-Regulation of S100A8 is an Independent Predictor of PSA Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Treated by Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Reduced anoctamin 7 (ANO7) expression is a strong and independent predictor of poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Chromatin conformation changes in peripheral blood can detect prostate cancer and stratify disease risk groups.', 'A Targeted Bioinformatics Assessment of Adrenocortical Carcinoma Reveals Prognostic Implications of GABA System Gene Expression.']"""
