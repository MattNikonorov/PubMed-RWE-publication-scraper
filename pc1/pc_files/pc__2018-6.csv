Optimal timing and coordination of care, however, is unclear and often based on arbitrary 5-year cutoffs.  Objective:   To determine high- and low-risk periods for all tumor types that could define when survivorship care might best be overseen by oncologists and when to transition to primary care physicians.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this pan-cancer, longitudinal, observational study, excess mortality hazard, calculated as an annualized mortality risk above a baseline population, was plotted over time. The time this hazard took to stabilize defined a high-risk period. The percent morality elevation above age- and sex-matched controls in the latter low-risk period was reported as a mortality gap. The US population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database defined the cancer population, and the US Census life tables defined controls. Incident cases of patients with cancer were separated into tumor types based on International Classification of Diseases for Oncology definitions.  Exposures:   Population-level data on incident cancer cases was compared with the general US population.  Main outcomes and measures:   Overall mortality and cause of death were reported on observed cancer cases.  Results:   A total of 2 317 185 patients (median age, 63 years; 49.8% female) with 66 primary tumor types were evaluated. High-risk surveillance period durations ranged from less than 1 year (breast, prostate, lip, ocular, and parathyroid cancers) up to 19 years (unspecified gastrointestinal cancers). The annualized mortality gap, representing the excess mortality in the stable period, ranged from a median 0.26% to 9.33% excess annual mortality (thyroid and hypopharyngeal cancer populations, respectively). Cluster analysis produced 6 risk cluster groups: group 1, with median survival of 16.2 (5th to 95th percentile range [PR], 10.7-40.2) years and median high-risk period of 2.5 (PR, 0-5.0) years; group 2, 8.3 (PR, 5.1-23.3) and 2.5 (PR, 4.0-8.0) years; group 3, 2.8 (PR, 1.4-3.7) and 7.0 (PR, 6.0-11.1) years; group 4, 1.6 (PR, 1.5-1.8) and 6.0 (PR, 5.1-11.4) years; group 5, 0.8 (PR, 0.5-1.2) and 0.8 (PR, 0.5-1.2) years; and group 6, 0.5 (PR, 0.4-0.8) and 12.0 (PR, 9.3-12.9) years, respectively. Subanalyses of selected tumor types in these groups revealed that stratifying on stage and histologic type can change the risk cluster and guidance for care.  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings indicate that a standardized 5-year surveillance period is inadequate for some cancers while excessive for others. High-risk cancers require the most resources with the longest high-risk period, highest persistent baseline mortality risk, and longest period of primary cancer mortality, all arguing for longer follow-up with an oncologist in these cancers.""","""['Robert L Dood', 'Yang Zhao', 'Shannon D Armbruster', 'Robert L Coleman', 'Shelley Tworoger', 'Anil K Sood', 'Keith A Baggerly']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Better Guidelines Needed for Cancer Survivorship Management.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Screening for Skin Cancer in Adults: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Weight Loss Interventions to Prevent Obesity-Related Morbidity and Mortality in Adults: An Updated Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Clinicians\' and Patients\' Perceptions and Use of the Word ""Cured"" in Cancer Care: An Italian Survey.', 'ncRNAs mediated RPS6KA2 inhibits ovarian cancer proliferation via p38/MAPK signaling pathway.', 'Comparison end-to-end anastomosis with ostomy after secondary surgical cytoreduction for recurrent high-grade serous ovarian cancer: observational single-center study.', 'Margin Free Resection Achieves Excellent Long Term Outcomes in Parathyroid Cancer.', 'Integrated multi-omic analysis of low-grade ovarian serous carcinoma collected from short and long-term survivors.']"""

The study was conducted as part of the Clarity-Pro trial (NCT02388308).  Methods and materials:   Initial locations of intraprostatic fiducial markers were identified from cone beam computed tomography scans. Marker positions were translated according to Clarity intrafraction 3-dimensional prostate motion estimates. The updated locations were projected onto the 2-dimensional electronic portal imager plane. These Clarity-based estimates were compared with the actual portal-imaged 2-dimensional marker positions. Images from 16 patients encompassing 80 fractions were analyzed. To investigate the influence of intraprostatic markers and image quality on ultrasound motion estimation, 3 observers rated image quality, and the marker visibility on ultrasound images was assessed.  Results:   The median difference between Clarity-defined intrafraction marker locations and portal-imaged marker locations was 0.6 mm (with 95% limit of agreement at 2.5 mm). Markers were identified on ultrasound in only 3 of a possible 240 instances. No linear relationship between image quality and Clarity motion estimation confidence was identified. The difference between Clarity-based motion estimates and electronic portal-imaged marker location was also independent of image quality. Clarity estimation confidence was degraded in a single fraction owing to poor probe placement.  Conclusions:   The accuracy of Clarity intrafraction prostate motion estimation is comparable with that of other motion-monitoring systems in radiation therapy. The effect of fiducial markers in the study was deemed negligible as they were rarely visible on ultrasound images compared with intrinsic anatomic features. Clarity motion estimation confidence was robust to variations in image quality and the number of ultrasound-imaged anatomic features; however, it was degraded as a result of poor probe placement.""","""['Alexander Grimwood', 'Helen A McNair', ""Tuathan P O'Shea"", 'Stephen Gilroy', 'Karen Thomas', 'Jeffrey C Bamber', 'Alison C Tree', 'Emma J Harris']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Intrafraction monitoring of prostate motion during radiotherapy using the Clarity® Autoscan Transperineal Ultrasound (TPUS) system.', 'Evaluation of transperineal ultrasound imaging as a potential solution for target tracking during hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'A Monte Carlo study of the effect of an ultrasound transducer on surface dose during intrafraction motion imaging for external beam radiation therapy.', 'Evaluation of intrafraction prostate motion tracking using the Clarity Autoscan system for safety margin validation.', 'Ultrasound-based guidance of intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Assessment of intrafraction motion and its dosimetric impact on prostate radiotherapy using an in-house developed position monitoring system.', 'A phantom-based analysis for tracking intra-fraction pancreatic tumor motion by ultrasound imaging during radiation therapy.', 'Impact of transperineal ultrasound on perineal skin dose in prostate radiation therapy.', 'The Potential of Photoacoustic Imaging in Radiation Oncology.', 'Injection of hydrogel spacer increased maximal intrafractional prostate motion in anterior and superior directions during volumetric modulated arc therapy-stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   We evaluated 262 individuals with intermediate- or high-risk PCa submitted to radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Within men with high-risk disease, we identified a subgroup of individuals harboring very high-risk (VHR, n = 28) disease: clinical stage ≥ T2c and more than 5 cores with Gleason score 8-10; primary biopsy Gleason score of 5; 3 high-risk features; or prostate-specific antigen ≥ 30 ng/mL. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) was assessed after stratifying patients according to risk group classification on a patient- and anatomic region-based analysis.  Results:   On patient-based analysis, considering high-risk patients (n = 155), 11C-choline PET/CT versus CECT had sensitivity and specificity of 50% and 76% versus 21% and 92%, respectively. Considering VHR men as separate subgroups (n = 28), 11C-choline PET/CT versus CECT had sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 93% versus 25% and 79%, respectively. Accordingly, in the VHR category, the area under the curve of 11C-choline PET/CT versus CECT was 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.0) versus 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.86), respectively.

Dysregulation of the androgen-AR signaling pathway has been linked to prostate cancer. Here, we demonstrate that tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) regulates AR expression level via the endosome/lysosome degradation pathway. In LNCaP cells, TSG101 overexpression recruits the AR to TSG101-containing cytoplasmic vesicles resulting in reduced AR protein level and AR transactivation activity downregulation. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that TSG101-decorated cytoplasmic vesicles are associated with late endosomes/lysosomes and the AR could be found within the Lamp2 positive TSG101 vesicles upon lysosomal protease inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, chloroquine or bafilomycin A1 treatment was able to restore TSG101-mediated AR expression reduction. Based on these data, we conclude that the interaction of the AR and TSG101 leads to AR recruitment to TSG101-containing cytoplasmic vesicles and induces AR-attenuated expression through the late endosome/lysosome degradation pathway.""","""['Yen-Ming Lin', 'Pao-Hsien Chu', 'Pin Ouyang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['HIV-1 Vpr Abrogates the Effect of TSG101 Overexpression to Support Virus Release.', 'Zipper-interacting protein kinase is involved in regulation of ubiquitination of the androgen receptor, thereby contributing to dynamic transcription complex assembly.', 'TSG101 interaction with HRS mediates endosomal trafficking and receptor down-regulation.', 'Molecular cell biology of androgen receptor signalling.', 'Genetic analysis of ESCRT function in Drosophila: a tumour model for human Tsg101.', 'DRAM1 plays a tumor suppressor role in NSCLC cells by promoting lysosomal degradation of EGFR.']"""

Although there are different options for treatment, the results are limited. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small, noncoding, regulatory RNAs with important roles in regulating gene expression. miR-145 is reported to be a key tumor suppressor miRNA (tsmiR) that controls important oncogenes, such as MYC and RAS. In this study, in vitro studies were performed to show the control of MYC and RAS by miR-145. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell proliferation and apoptosis. The efficacy of miR-145 in treating metastatic PCa was tested in nude mice using a model of bone metastasis promoted by intraventricular injection of PC-3MLuc-C6 cells. Tumor growth was evaluated by an in vivo bioluminescence system. After the full establishment of metastases on day 21, six animals were treated with three intravenous doses of miR-145 (on days 21, 24 and 27), and six were injected with scramble miRNA as controls. Compared to the controls, tumor growth was significantly reduced in animals receiving miR-145, most importantly on day 7 after the third and last dose of miRNA. After discontinuing the treatment, tumor growth resumed, becoming similar to the group of non-treated animals. A decrease in MYC and RAS expression was observed in all cell lines after treatment with miR-145, although statistical significance was achieved only in experiments with LNCaP and PC3 cell lines, with a decrease in 56% (p = 0.012) and 31% (p = 0.013) of RAS expression, respectively.

The prevalence of incidental prostate cancer (iPCa) during surgery varies depending on many preoperative factors. To evaluate whether the surgical procedure itself (HoLEP vs. TURP) influences iPCa detection, we performed a case-by-case matched-pair analysis.  Methods:   Preoperative patient age, total PSA, and prostate volume were used as matching criteria. Descriptive statistics were used to confirm matching quality. Parameters were analyzed by Fisher's exact test and T test or Mann-Whitney U test for dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors for iPCa detection.  Results:   60 out of 136 patients after HoLEP and 60 out of 1220 patients after bipolar TURP (bTURP) could be included. Mean patient age was 71.5 and 70.3 years in the HoLEP and bTURP group, respectively. Median preoperative total PSA was 4.42 ng/ml for HoLEP and 4.33 ng/ml for bTURP patients. Median preoperative prostate volume was 75.0 cc in both groups. Mean percentage of tissue removed by HoLEP and bTURP was 63.5 and 49.5% (p < 0.001), respectively. IPCa was found in 23.3% of HoLEP specimens compared to 8.3% in bTURP (p = 0.043). PSA density was the only independent predictor for iPCa detection.

Activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) was found to promote EMT and metastasis in prostate and breast cancers, but the effects and mechanisms in lung cancer was unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore whether and how activation of FGFR1 promotes EMT and metastasis in FGFR1-amplified lung cancer. We show that activation of FGFR1 by its ligand fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) promoted proliferation, EMT, migration, and invasion in FGFR1-amplified lung cancer cell lines H1581 and DMS114, whereas inhibition of FGFR1 suppressed these processes. FGFR1 activation upregulated expression of Sry-related HMG box 2 (SOX2) by downstream phosphorylated ERK1/2; moreover, the upregulation of SOX2 by autophosphorylation variant ERK2_R67S plasmid transfection was not suppressed by FGFR1 inhibitor AZD4547 or MEK/ERK inhibitor AZD6244 in vitro. And SOX2 expression was also significantly upregulated in ERK2_R67S lentivirus-transfected stable cell lines in vivo. Overexpression of SOX2 promoted cell proliferation, EMT, migration, and invasion. Importantly, activation of FGFR1 could not promote these processes in SOX2-silenced stable cell lines. In orthotopic and subcutaneous lung cancer xenograft models, inhibition of FGFR1 suppressed tumor growth, SOX2 expression, EMT, and metastasis in vivo; however, these processes caused by SOX2-overexpressing stable cell lines were not suppressed by FGFR1 inhibition. Higher expression of FGFR1 and SOX2 were positively correlated, and both were associated with shorter survival in lung cancer patients.

Dickkopf-3 (Dkk-3), shown to inhibit TGF-β signaling, is downregulated in prostate cancer and upregulated in the stroma in benign prostatic hyperplasia, but the function of stromal Dkk-3 is unclear. Here we show that DKK3 silencing in WPMY-1 prostate stromal cells increases TGF-β signaling activity and that stromal cell-conditioned media inhibit prostate cancer cell invasion in a Dkk-3-dependent manner. DKK3 silencing increased the level of the cell-adhesion regulator TGF-β-induced protein (TGFBI) in stromal and epithelial cell-conditioned media, and recombinant TGFBI increased prostate cancer cell invasion. Reduced expression of Dkk-3 in patient tumors was associated with increased expression of TGFBI. DKK3 silencing reduced the level of extracellular matrix protein-1 (ECM-1) in prostate stromal cell-conditioned media but increased it in epithelial cell-conditioned media, and recombinant ECM-1 inhibited TGFBI-induced prostate cancer cell invasion. Increased ECM1 and DKK3 mRNA expression in prostate tumors was associated with increased relapse-free survival. These observations are consistent with a model in which the loss of Dkk-3 in prostate cancer leads to increased secretion of TGFBI and ECM-1, which have tumor-promoting and tumor-protective roles, respectively.

Although efficacy of sipuleucel-T is well established, its mechanism remains incompletely understood.Patients and Methods: Patient samples from three sipuleucel-T trials were assessed for peripheral cellular immune responses to the immunogen PA2024 and the target antigen prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). PAP- and PA2024-specific proliferative and cytolytic responses were characterized to delineate sipuleucel-T-induced immune responses. To quantify potential cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, cell-surface CD107a expression on PAP- or PA2024-specific CD8+ T cells was measured in sipuleucel-T-treated patient and healthy volunteer samples.Results: Increased PA2024-specific CD4+ (P = 0.030) and CD8+ (P = 0.052) T-cell proliferation from baseline to week 6 was observed (N = 14) post-sipuleucel-T, with greater magnitude of PA2024-specific responses compared with PAP. PAP- and PA2024-CTL activity (CD107a positivity) significantly increased at weeks 6 and 26 after sipuleucel-T treatment (P < 0.0001; N = 22). At 26 weeks post-sipuleucel-T, OS correlated with the magnitude of PAP (Pearson R, 0.52; P = 0.013) or PA2024 (Pearson R, 0.67; P = 0.0006) CTL activity. Higher PA2024-CTL activity at week 26 was significantly associated with longer OS using tertile analysis (P = 0.0005; N = 22), with PA2024 responses correlating with PAP responses at week 26 (R = 0.90; P = 1.53E-08).Conclusions: This study is the first to report PAP-specific CD8+ T-cell responses elicited by sipuleucel-T treatment. Increased and persistent potential PA2024-specific CTL activity correlated with PAP-specific CTL activity and associated with improved OS following sipuleucel-T treatment.

Recent studies suggested that PSA-density (PSA-D) in combination with multi-parametric prostate MR as well as bp-MR may achieve a higher diagnostic accuracy than either alone. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of bp-MR, PSA-D and their combination in biopsy-naïve patients.  Methods and materials:   We retrospectively analyzed 334 consecutive patients who underwent prostate MR on a 3T scanner. Only patients (n = 114) who underwent TRUS-biopsy within 30 days following MR with no previous prostate biopsies were considered. Our protocol included T2-weighted and DWI sequences. A Likert score based on PI-RADS v2 was used for bp-MR evaluation. Lesions were graded histopathologically using the ISUP score. We assessed three scenarios: detection of lesions independently of ISUP score (ISUP ≥ 1), detection of both intermediate and clinically significant lesions (ISUP ≥ 2) and detection of clinically significant lesions alone (ISUP ≥ 3). Predictive value of bp-MR and PSA-D was evaluated by ROC curves and logistic regression analysis. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   In all evaluated scenarios, bp-MR showed a significantly higher predictive power (AUC = 0.87-0.95) compared to the performance of PSA-D (AUC = 0.73-0.79), while their combination (AUC = 0.91-0.95) showed no statistically significant improvement compared to bp-MR alone.  Conclusion:   Our results confirm that bp-MR is a powerful tool in detection of clinically significant PCa. Contrary to findings in the recent literature, PSA-D does not appear to significantly improve its diagnostic performance.""","""['Renato Cuocolo', 'Arnaldo Stanzione', 'Giovanni Rusconi', 'Mario Petretta', 'Andrea Ponsiglione', 'Ferdinando Fusco', 'Nicola Longo', 'Francesco Persico', 'Sirio Cocozza', 'Arturo Brunetti', 'Massimo Imbriaco']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Combination of prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) score and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density predicts biopsy outcome in prostate biopsy naïve patients.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of biparametric vs multiparametric MRI in clinically significant prostate cancer: Comparison between readers with different experience.', 'Can Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in men with PSA levels of 4-10\xa0ng/ml?', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and imaging tools in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer, a review.', 'Texture analysis of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for differentiating clinically significant prostate cancer in the peripheral zone.', 'Detection of intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer with biparametric magnetic resonance imaging: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Variables Associated with False-Positive PSA Results: A Cohort Study with Real-World Data.', 'Combining prostate-specific antigen density with prostate imaging reporting and data system score version 2.1 to improve detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: A retrospective study.', 'Head-to-head comparison of biparametric versus multiparametric MRI of the prostate before robot-assisted transperineal fusion prostate biopsy.']"""

Herein, we optimized the use of soft glycogen nanoparticles for the engineering of glycogen-siRNA constructs that can efficiently penetrate multicellular tumor spheroids and exert a significant gene silencing effect. Glycogen nanoparticles from different bio-sources and with different structural features were investigated. We show that larger glycogen nanoparticles ranging from 50 to 80 nm are suboptimal systems for complexation of nucleic acids if fine control of the size of constructs is required. Our studies suggest that 20 nm glycogen nanoparticles are optimal for complexation and efficient delivery of siRNA. The chemical composition, surface charge, and size of glycogen-siRNA constructs were finely controlled to minimize interactions with serum proteins and allow penetration into 3D multicellular spheroids of human kidney epithelial cells and human prostate cancer cells. We introduced pH sensitive moieties within the construct to enhance early endosome escape and efficiently improve the silencing effect in vitro. Glycogen-siRNA constructs were found to mediate gene silencing in 3D multicellular spheroids causing ∼60% specific gene silencing. The optimized construct exhibited an in vivo circulation lifetime of 8 h in mice, with preferential accumulation in the liver. No accumulation in the kidney, lung, spleen, heart or brain, or signs of toxicity in mice were observed.

Potential mechanisms of action include degrading constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) or inhibiting other drug-resistance pathways (e.g., Wnt-signaling). Published pharmacokinetics data suggests that niclosamide has poor oral bioavailability, potentially limiting its use as a cancer drug. Therefore, we launched a Phase I study testing oral niclosamide in combination with enzalutamide, for longer and at higher doses than those used to treat helminthic infections.  Methods:   We conducted a Phase I dose-escalation study testing oral niclosamide plus standard-dose enzalutamide in men with metastatic CRPC previously treated with abiraterone. Niclosamide was given three-times-daily (TID) at the following dose-levels: 500, 1000 or 1500mg. The primary objective was to assess safety. Secondary objectives, included measuring AR-V expression from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using the AdnaTest assay, evaluating PSA changes and determining niclosamide's pharmacokinetic profile.  Results:   20 patients screened and 5 enrolled after passing all screening procedures. 13(65%) patients had detectable CTCs, but only one was AR-V+. There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in 3 patients on the 500mg TID cohort; however, both (N = 2) subjects on the 1000mg TID cohort experienced DLTs (prolonged grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; and colitis). The maximum plasma concentration ranged from 35.7 to 182 ng/mL and was not consistently above the minimum effective concentration in preclinical studies. There were no PSA declines in any enrolled subject. Because plasma concentrations at the maximum tolerated dose (500mg TID) were not consistently above the expected therapeutic threshold, the Data Safety Monitoring Board closed the study for futility.  Conclusions:   Oral niclosamide could not be escalated above 500mg TID, and plasma concentrations were not consistently above the threshold shown to inhibit growth in CRPC models. Oral niclosamide is not a viable compound for repurposing as a CRPC treatment.

Methods:   To clarify contradictory findings on the prognostic role of PSCA expression, a tissue microarray containing 13,665 prostate cancers was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   PSCA staining was absent in normal epithelial and stromal cells of the prostate. Membranous and cytoplasmic PSCA staining was seen in 53.7% of 9642 interpretable tumors. Staining was weak in 22.4%, moderate in 24.5% and strong in 6.8% of tumors. PSCA expression was associated with favorable pathological and clinical tumor features: Early pathological tumor stage (p < 0.0001), low Gleason grade (p < 0.0001), absence of lymph node metastasis (p < 0.0001), low pre-operative PSA level (p = 0.0118), negative surgical margin (p < 0.0001) and reduced PSA recurrence (p < 0.0001). PSCA expression was an independent predictor of prognosis in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 0.84, p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   The absence of statistical relationship to TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status, chromosomal deletion or high tumor cell proliferation argues against a major role of PSCA for regulation of cell cycle or genomic integrity.

The dose deposited in each detector was then used to localize the source position using a proprietary reconstruction algorithm.  Results:   The accuracy of source position verification using the Magic Plate embedded in the patient couch was found to be affected by the tissue inhomogeneities within the patient, with an average difference of 2.1 ± 0.8 mm (k = 1) between the Magic Plate predicted and known source positions. Recalculation of the simulations with all voxels assigned a density of water improved this verification accuracy to within 1 mm.  Conclusion:   Source position verification using the Magic Plate during a HDR prostate brachytherapy treatment was examined using MC simulations. In a homogenous geometry (water), the Magic Plate was able to localize the source to within 1 mm, however, the verification accuracy was negatively affected by inhomogeneities; this can be corrected for by using density information obtained from CT, making the proposed tool attractive for use as a real-time in vivo quality assurance (QA) device in HDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer.""","""['Joel Poder', 'Dean Cutajar', 'Susanna Guatelli', 'Marco Petasecca', 'Andrew Howie', 'Joseph Bucci', 'Anatoly Rosenfeld']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['A Monte Carlo study on the feasibility of real-time in vivo source tracking during ultrasound based HDR prostate brachytherapy treatments.', 'The feasibility study and characterization of a two-dimensional diode array in ""magic phantom"" for high dose rate brachytherapy quality assurance.', 'BrachyView, a novel inbody imaging system for HDR prostate brachytherapy: design and Monte Carlo feasibility study.', 'In vivo dosimetry in brachytherapy: Requirements and future directions for research, development, and clinical practice.', 'Electromagnetic tracking for treatment verification in interstitial brachytherapy.', 'Investigation of in vivo source tracking error thresholds for interstitial and intra-cavitary high-dose-rate cervical brachytherapy.']"""

Our data indicate that cell migration and colony formation were affected in the presence of C12-HSL. C12-HSL induced apoptosis and altered viability of both PA and SCNC cells in a concentration dependent manner as measured by fluorescence and chemiluminescence assays. Compared to PCa cells, noncancerous prostate epithelial cells (RWPE1) were resistant to modification by C12-HSL. Further, the viability of PC3 cells in 3D matrix was suppressed by C12-HSL treatment as detected using calcein AM fluorescence in situ. C12-HSL treatment induced cytoskeletal associated protein expression of vinculin and RhoC, which may have implications in cancer cell motility, adhesion, and metastasis.

Since ccRCC is a malignancy dependent on neovascularization, current first line systemic therapies like sunitinib, target the formation of new vessels allowing nutrient deprivation and cell death. However, recent studies have shown that patients develop resistance after approximately 1 year of treatment and show disease progression while on therapy. Therefore, we propose to identify the protein(s) responsible for increased migration with the aim of developing a new therapy that will target the identified protein and potentially slow down the progression of the disease.  Material and methods:   Human renal cancer cell lines (Caki-1, Caki-2, ACHN) were treated with increasing doses of sunitinib to develop a sunitinib-conditioned renal cell carcinoma cell line. mRNA microarray and qPCR were performed to compare the differences in gene expression between Caki-1 sunitinib-conditioned and non-conditioned cells. NTN1 was assessed in our in vivo sunitinib-conditioned mouse model using immunostaining. xCELLigence and scratch assays were used to evaluate migration and MTS was used to evaluate cell viability.  Results:   Human renal cell carcinoma sunitinib-conditioned cell lines showed upregulation of netrin-1 in microarray and q-PCR. Increased migration was demonstrated in Caki-1 sunitinib-conditioned cells when compared to the non-treated ones as well as, increased endothelial cell migration. Silencing of netrin-1 in sunitinib-conditioned Caki-1 cells did not demonstrate a significant reduction in cell migration.

While localized therapy is highly curative, treatments for metastatic prostate cancer are largely palliative. Thus, new innovative therapies are needed to target metastatic tumors. Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) is a chymotrypsin-like protease with a unique substrate specificity that is secreted by both normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells. Previous studies demonstrated the presence of high levels (μM-mM) of enzymatically active PSA is present in the extracellular fluid of the prostate cancer microenvironment. Because of this, PSA is an attractive target for a protease activated pro-toxin therapeutic strategy. Because prostate cancers typically grow very slowly, a strategy employing a proliferation-independent cytotoxic payload is preferred. Recently, it was shown that the human protease Granzyme B (GZMB), at low micromolar concentrations in the extracellular space, can cleave an array of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins thus perturbing cell growth, signaling, motility, and integrity. It is also well established that other human proteases such as trypsin can induce similar effects. Because both enzymes require N-terminal proteolytic activation, we propose to convert these proteins into PSA-activated cytotoxins. In this study, we examine the enzymatic and cell targeting parameters of these PSA-activated cytotoxic serine proteases. These pro-enzymes were activated robustly by PSA and induced ECM damage that led to the death of prostate cancer cells in vitro thus supporting the potential use of this strategy as means to target metastatic prostate cancers.""","""['Oliver C Rogers', 'Lizamma Anthony', 'D Marc Rosen', 'W Nathaniel Brennen', 'Samuel R Denmeade']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Specific and efficient peptide substrates for assaying the proteolytic activity of prostate-specific antigen.', 'Activation of latent protease function of pro-hK2, but not pro-PSA, involves autoprocessing.', 'Concentration of enzymatically active prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the extracellular fluid of primary human prostate cancers and human prostate cancer xenograft models.', 'Albumin-linked prostate-specific antigen-activated thapsigargin- and niclosamide-based molecular grenades targeting the microenvironment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Human prostate cancer progression models and therapeutic intervention.', 'Targeted delivery of cytotoxic proteins to prostate cancer via conjugation to small molecule urea-based PSMA inhibitors.']"""

The current gold standard in early detection of prostate cancer, the prostate specific antigen test, boasts a high sensitivity but low specificity, resulting in many unnecessary prostate biopsies. Thus, emphasis has been placed on identifying new biomarkers to improve prostate cancer detection. Glypican-1 has recently been proposed as one such biomarker, however further exploration into its predictive power has been hindered by a lack of available, dependable glypican-1 immunoassays. Previously, we identified human glypican-1 as the antigenic target of the MIL-38 monoclonal antibody. Additionally, we have now generated another monoclonal antibody, 3G5, that also recognizes human glypican-1. Here we report the development of a reliable, custom Luminex® assay that enables precise quantitation of circulating human glypican-1 in plasma and serum. Using this assay, we show for the first time that circulating glypican-1 levels can differentiate non-cancer (normal and benign prostatic hyperplasia) patients from prostate cancer patients, as well as benign prostatic hyperplasia patients alone from prostate cancer patients.

Despite its high incidence and mortality, the likelihood of a cure is low for late-stages of PC. There is an unmet need for more effective agents for treating PC. Here, we present a drug repositioning system, GenoPredict, for finding innovative drug candidates for treating PC. GenoPredict leverages upon a large amount of disease genomics data and a large-scale drug treatment knowledge base (TreatKB) that we recently constructed. We first constructed a genetic disease network (GDN) that comprised of 882 nodes and 200,758 edges and applied a network-based ranking algorithm to find diseases from GDN that are genetically related to PC. We developed a drug prioritization algorithm to reposition drugs from PC-related diseases to treat PC. When evaluated in a de-novo prediction setting using 27 FDA- approved PC drugs, GenoPredict found 25 of 27 FDA-approved PC drugs and ranked them highly (recall: 0.925, mean ranking: 27.3%, median ranking: 15.6%). When compared to PREDICT, a comprehensive drug repositioning system, in novel predictions, GenoPredict performed better than PREDICT across two evaluation datasets.

Method:   The radiochemical purity and stability of 68Ga-PSMA-11 were determined via radio-HPLC. The PCa cell lines of different PSMA expression levels (PC3, VCAP±, CWR22RV1+, and LNCaP++) were selected to mimic the PCa progression. 68Ga-PSMA-11 biodistribution was studied by dissection method and in vivo imaging with micro PET-CT. The expression levels of PSMA in tumor cells and tissues were analyzed by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and western blot. The correlation between PSMA expression and radio-uptake was also evaluated. 2-PMPA preadministration served as a block group.  Results:   The radiochemical purity of 68Ga-PSMA-11 was 99.6 ± 0.1% and stable in vitro for 2 h. The equilibrium binding constant (Kd) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 to LNCaP, CWR22Rv1, PC-3, and VCAP cells was 4.3 ± 0.8 nM, 16.4 ± 1.3 nM, 225.3 ± 20.8 nM, and 125.6 ± 13.1 nM, respectively.

Tumor uptake (% ID/cm3) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 increased with the tumor anatomical volume in quadratic polynomial fashion and reached the peak (when tumor volume was 0.5 cm3) earlier than tumor uptake (% ID). Tumor uptake (% ID/cm3) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 based on functional volume correlated well with the PSMA expression in a linear manner (y = 9.35x + 2.59, R2 = 0.8924, and p < 0.0001); however, low dose 2-PMPA causes rapid renal clearance of increased tumor/kidney uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-11.

The ability to noninvasively interrogate AR expression over time in murine models of prostate cancer would permit longitudinal preclinical analysis of novel compounds that could not otherwise be accomplished ex vivo. Although PET imaging with 16β-18F-fluoro-5α-dihydrotestosterone (18F-FDHT) has successfully quantified AR levels clinically, no rodent model of 18F-FDHT imaging has been reported so far. One difference between humans and rodents is the absence in the latter of the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), a glycoprotein that binds to testosterone in the bloodstream, Here, we explore the role of SHBG in developing a working model of rodent AR imaging. Methods: Three human prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC3) were used to examine the uptake of free 18F-FDHT and SHBG-bound 18F-FDHT. Both ligands were examined for stability and competitive binding to AR over time in vitro before in vivo studies. PET/CT imaging was used to dynamically measure the uptake of both tracers over 4 h, whereas specificity was determined by competitive binding with the AR antagonist enzalutamide. Results: AR levels correlated with the uptake of both 18F-FDHT and SHBG-18F-FDHT in prostate cancer cell lines. Interestingly, whereas both free and SHBG-bound 18F-FDHT had a similar cellular accumulation at 1 and 2.5 h, SHBG-18F-FDHT accumulated at significantly higher levels after 4 h-evidence that receptor-mediated uptake of SHBG accounted for later time-point differences. This observation was also seen in 22Rv1 tumor-bearing mice, in which SHBG-18F-FDHT exhibited a significantly increased uptake (average tumor-to-background ratio [TBR], 1.62 ± 0.62) in comparison to unbound 18F-FDHT (TBR, 0.81 ± 0.08) at 4 h.

Materials and methods:   We identified all patients who underwent 3 Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging prior to fusion biopsy and radical prostatectomy. The Partin and the MSKCC (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) preradical prostatectomy nomograms were applied to estimate the probability of organ confined disease, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion and lymph node involvement using transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsy and transrectal ultrasound/multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging fusion guided targeted biopsy Gleason scores. With radical prostatectomy pathology as the gold standard we developed multivariable logistic regression models based on these nomograms before and after adding multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to assess any additional predictive ability.  Results:   A total of 532 patients were included in study. When multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging findings were added to the systematic biopsy based MSKCC nomogram, the AUC increased by 0.10 for organ confined disease (p <0.001), 0.10 for extraprostatic extension (p = 0.003), 0.09 for seminal vesicle invasion (p = 0.011) and 0.06 for lymph node involvement (p = 0.120). Using Gleason scores derived from targeted biopsy compared to systematic biopsy provided an additional predictive value of organ confined disease (Δ AUC 0.07, p = 0.003) and extraprostatic extension (Δ AUC 0.07, p = 0.048) at radical prostatectomy with the MSKCC nomogram. Similar results were obtained using the Partin nomogram.

Decision aids may facilitate this process but the impact of decision aids on screening preferences is poorly understood.  Materials and methods:   In an online survey we randomized a national sample of adults to the online decision aids of 1 of 6 professional societies. We compared survey responses before and after decision aid exposure. The primary outcome was the change in participant likelihood of undergoing or recommending prostate cancer screening on a scale of 1-unlikely to 100-extremely likely. Secondary outcomes included change in participant comfort with prostate cancer screening based on the average of 6, 5-point Likert-scale questions.  Results:   Median age was 53 years in the 1,336 participants and 50% were men. The randomized groups did not differ significantly by race, age, gender, income, marital status or education level. The likelihood of undergoing or recommending prostate cancer screening decreased from 83 to 78 following decision aid exposure (p <0.001). Reviewing the decision aid from the Centers for Disease Control or the American Academy of Family Physicians did not alter the likelihood (each p >0.2). However, the decision aid from the United States Preventive Services Task Force was associated with the largest decrease in screening preference (-16.0, p <0.001). Participants reported increased comfort (from 3.5 to 4.1 of 5) with the decision making process of prostate cancer screening following exposure to a decision aid (p <0.001).

Rh family, C glycoprotein (RHCG) belongs to the Rhesus (Rh) family and was first identified as Rh blood group antigens. It has been confirmed to function in cancer progression, including prostate cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, its role in cervical cancer has never been explored. The present study indicated that RHCG was down-regulated in cervical cancers compared to that in normal cervical tissues, and further decreased in cervical cancer cell lines. Functionally, RHCG overexpression reduced cervical cancer cell proliferation and migration, as evidenced by the decreased transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expressions in cancer cells; however, an opposite effect was observed when RHCG was knocked down. Further, increase of RHCG markedly induced apoptosis in cervical cancer cells by improving the cleavage of Caspase-3 and poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase (PARP). And cells transfected with RHCG siRNA exhibited a notable reduction of cleaved Caspase-3 and PARP. Moreover, nucleus nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and whole cell xIPA expressions were markedly reduced by over-expressing RHCG. Conversely, suppressing RHCG elevated NF-κB activation and xIPA expression in cervical cancer cells. Notably, we found that TGF-β1 treatment could abolish the effects of RHCG over-expression on the reduction of cell migration and enhancement of apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. Over-expressing RHCG-reduced NF-κB activation and xIPA expression were also abrogated by TGF-β1 pre-treatment. Additionally, enhancing NF-κB activity could restore xIPA expressions and decrease apoptotic response in cervical cancer cells over-expressing RHCG. In vivo, we also found that RHCG over-expression reduced cervical tumor growth through the same signaling pathways as we found in vitro. Therefore, RHCG may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for human cervical cancer.""","""['Dong-Ge Wang', 'Tong-Min Li', 'Xuan Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['RHCG Suppresses Tumorigenicity and Metastasis in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma via Inhibiting NF-κB Signaling and MMP1 Expression.', 'Down-regulation of JMJD5 suppresses metastasis and induces apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma by regulating p53/NF-κB pathway.', 'High RhCG expression predicts poor survival and promotes migration and proliferation of gastric cancer via keeping intracellular alkaline.', 'Tranilast inhibits cell proliferation and migration and promotes apoptosis in murine breast cancer.', 'Uterine cervical carcinoma: role of matrix metalloproteinases (review).', 'Comprehensive Molecular Analyses of a TNF Family-Based Gene Signature as a Potentially Novel Prognostic Biomarker for Cervical Cancer.', 'Oncogenic Long Noncoding RNA DARS-AS1 in Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia by Binding to microRNA-425.', 'Diagnostic Role of Dysregulated Circular RNA hsa_circ_0036722 in Laryngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Rh type C-glycoprotein functions as a novel tumor suppressor gene by inhibiting tumorigenicity and metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Application of the Transcriptional Disease Signature (TDSs) to Screen Melanoma-Effective Compounds in a Small Fish Model.']"""

Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor (LHRH-R) has attracted considerable interest for this application, since LHRH-R is upregulated in ∼86% of prostate cancers, ∼80% of endometrial cancers, ∼80% of ovarian cancers, and ∼50% of breast cancers, but virtually absent from normal tissues. Although LHRH and related peptides have been used to deliver cytotoxic drugs to LHRH-R overexpressing cancer cells, they have suffered from off-target delivery of the therapeutic agents to the liver and kidneys. To reduce such unwanted uptake by peptide scavenger receptors in the liver and kidneys, we have explored the use of a nonpeptidic LHRH-R antagonist (NBI42902) to construct an LHRH-R targeted tubulysin conjugate (BOEPL-L3-TubBH). In vitro studies with BOEPL-L3-TubBH demonstrate that the conjugate can kill LHRH-R expressing triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 cells) with low nanomolar IC50. Related studies on tumor-bearing mice further reveal that the same conjugate can eradicate MDA-MB-231 solid tumors without any measurable side-effects, yielding mice that gain weight during therapy and show no evidence of tumor recurrence for at least 5 weeks after termination of treatment. That these complete responses are LHRH-R targeted was then established by showing that identical treatment of receptor-negative (SKOV3) tumors yields no antitumor response. Overall, these data provide a proof-of-concept that LHRH-R specific targeting of an extremely toxic drug like tubulysin B can treat LHRH-R positive tumors without causing significant toxicity to healthy cells.""","""['Jyoti Roy', 'Miranda Kaake', 'Madduri Srinivasarao', 'Philip S Low']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Small molecule targeted NIR dye conjugate for imaging LHRH receptor positive cancers.', 'Targeting of cytotoxic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs to breast, ovarian, endometrial, and prostate cancers.', 'AEZS-108 : a targeted cytotoxic analog of LHRH for the treatment of cancers positive for LHRH receptors.', 'Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor-targeted chemotherapy using AN-152.', 'Antitumor effects of the cytotoxic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog AN-152 on human endometrial and ovarian cancers xenografted into nude mice.', 'Efficient capture of circulating tumor cells with low molecular weight folate receptor-specific ligands.', 'Myxobacteria as a Source of New Bioactive Compounds: A Perspective Study.', 'Design and validation of fibroblast activation protein alpha targeted imaging and therapeutic agents.', 'Small molecule targeted NIR dye conjugate for imaging LHRH receptor positive cancers.']"""

Method:   We now report on the generation of two mouse prostate cancer cell lines, BMPC1 and BMPC2, derived from a lymph node, and liver metastasis, respectively.  Results:   Both cell lines demonstrate a phenotype consistent with adenocarcinoma and grew under standard tissue culture conditions. Androgen receptor (AR) protein expression is minimal (BMPC1) or absent (BMPC2) consistent with AR loss observed in the BMPC mouse model of invasive adenocarcinoma. Growth in media containing charcoal-stripped serum resulted in an increase in AR mRNA in BMPC1 cells with no effect on protein expression, unless androgens were added, in which case AR protein was stabilized, and showed nuclear localization. AR expression in BMPC2 cells was not effected by growth media or treatment with androgens. Treatment with an anti-androgen/castration or androgen supplemented media did not affect in vitro or in vivo growth of either cell line, irrespective of nuclear AR detection.

The solid angle provides an estimate of the tridimensional surface area provided by an original angle resulting in the best estimate of the surgeon's view/exposure to the critical dissecting point of choice (anterior rectal wall). The difference (""Gain"") in surgical field exposure by removal of the coccyx was compared by the solid angle variation between the two estimates (with and without the coccyx).  Results:   Routine removal of the coccyx determines an average 42% (95% CI 27-57%) gain in surgical field exposure area facing the anterior rectal wall at the level of the prostate/vagina by the surgeon. Fifteen (51%) patients had ≥30% (median) estimated gain in surgical field exposure by coccygectomy. There was no association between BMI, age or gender and estimated gain in surgical field exposure area.  Conclusions:   Routine removal of the coccyx during APR may result in an average increase in 42% in surgical field exposure during APR's perineal dissection.

A combination of RNA sequencing, array-based and quantitative PCR transcriptomics in cellular, murine and various ex vivo human models has led to a comprehensive description of a fundamental set of genes with demonstrable dosimetric qualities. However, these are yet to be validated in human tissue due to the scarcity of in situ-irradiated source material. This represents a major hurdle to the continued development of transcriptional dosimetry. In this study, we present a novel evaluation of a previously reported set of dosimetric genes in human tissue exposed to a large therapeutic dose of radiation. To do this, we evaluated the quantitative changes of a set of dosimetric transcripts consisting of FDXR, BAX, BCL2, CDKN1A, DDB2, BBC3, GADD45A, GDF15, MDM2, SERPINE1, TNFRSF10B, PLK3, SESN2 and VWCE in guided pre- and post-radiation (2 weeks) prostate cancer biopsies from seven patients. We confirmed the prolonged dose-responsivity of most of these transcripts in in situ-irradiated tissue. BCL2, GDF15, and to some extent TNFRSF10B, were markedly unreliable single markers of radiation exposure. Nevertheless, as a full set, these genes reliably segregated non-irradiated and irradiated tissues and predicted radiation absorption on a patient-specific basis. We also confirmed changes in the translated protein product for a small subset of these dosimeters. This study provides the first confirmatory evidence of an existing dosimetric gene set in less-accessible tissues-ensuring peripheral responses reflect tissue-specific effects. Further work will be required to determine if these changes are conserved in different tissue types, post-radiation times and doses.""","""['Simon P Keam', 'Twishi Gulati', 'Cristina Gamell', 'Franco Caramia', 'Gisela Mir Arnau', 'Cheng Huang', 'Ralf B Schittenhelm', 'Oded Kleifeld', 'Paul J Neeson', 'Scott G Williams', 'Ygal Haupt']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiat Environ Biophys""","""['Toward the development of transcriptional biodosimetry for the identification of irradiated individuals and assessment of absorbed radiation dose.', 'Developing Gender-Specific Gene Expression Biodosimetry Using a Panel of Radiation-Responsive Genes for Determining Radiation Dose in Human Peripheral Blood.', 'Gene expression analysis in radiotherapy patients and C57BL/6 mice as a measure of exposure to ionizing radiation.', 'Radiation dosimetry and biophysical models of space radiation effects.', 'Need, feasibility and convenience of dosimetric treatment planning in liver selective internal radiation therapy with (90)Y microspheres: the experience of the National Tumor Institute of Milan.', 'Modelling aggressive prostate cancers of young men in immune-competent mice, driven by isogenic Trp53 alterations and Pten loss.', 'Immune molecular profiling of a multiresistant primary prostate cancer with a neuroendocrine-like phenotype: a case report.', 'High dose-rate brachytherapy of localized prostate cancer converts tumors from cold to hot.']"""

A germline variant in HSD3B1, the gene that encodes 3βHSD1, encodes for a stable enzyme, regulates adrenal androgen dependence, and is a predictive biomarker of poor clinical outcomes after gonadal testosterone deprivation therapy. However, little is known about HSD3B1 transcriptional regulation. Generally, it is thought that intratumoral androgen synthesis is upregulated after gonadal testosterone deprivation, enabling development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Given its critical role in extragonadal androgen synthesis, we sought to directly interrogate the transcriptional regulation of HSD3B1 in multiple metastatic prostate cancer cell models. Surprisingly, we found that VCaP, CWR22Rv1, LNCaP, and LAPC4 models demonstrate induction of HSD3B1 upon androgen stimulation for approximately 72 hours, followed by attenuation around 120 hours. 3βHSD1 protein levels mirrored transcriptional changes in models harboring variant (LNCaP) and wild-type (LAPC4) HSD3B1, and in these models androgen induction of HSD3B1 is abrogated via enzalutamide treatment. Androgen treatment increased flux from [3H]-dehydroepiandrosterone to androstenedione and other downstream metabolites. HSD3B1 expression was reduced 72 hours after castration in the VCaP xenograft mouse model, suggesting androgen receptor (AR) regulation of HSD3B1 also occurs in vivo.

Cytochalasin B-induced membrane vesicles (CIMVs) were successfully tested as a vector for delivery of dye, nanoparticles, and a chemotherapeutic. However, it remained unclear whether CIMVs possess fusion specificity with target cells and thus might be used for more targeted delivery of therapeutics. To answer this question, CIMVs were obtained from human prostate cancer PC3 cells. The diameter of obtained CIMVs was 962,13 ± 140,6 nm.

The present study aimed to identify miRNAs that target BCL2 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes in prostate cancer (PCa) clinical tissue samples. Certain candidate miRNAs were selected bioinformatically and their expression in PCa samples was analyzed and compared with that in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue samples. The candidate miRNAs that targeted BCL2 and BCL2L1 genes were searched in online databases (miRWalk, microRNA.org, miRDB and TargetScan). A total of 12 miRNAs that target the 3'-untranslated region of the aforementioned genes and/or for which downregulation of their expression has previously been reported in cancer tissues. A total of 30 tumor tissue samples from patients with PCa and 30 samples tissues from patients with BPH were obtained and were subjected to reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction for expression analysis of 12 candidate miRNAs, and the BCL2 and BCL2L1 genes.

We find that phosphorylated PAK4S474 (pPAK4) levels, an index of PAK4 activation, were tightly associated with Gleason score (p < 0.001), a clinical indicator of PC progression, but not with prostate serum antigen levels or tumor stage. Stable silencing of PAK4 in PC cells reduced their potential for EMT, cellular invasion, and metastasis in vivo. PAK4 bound and directly phosphorylated Slug at two previously unknown sites, S158 and S254, which resulted in its stabilization. The non-phosphorylatable form SlugS158A/S254A upregulated transcription of CDH1, which encodes E-cadherin, and thus suppressed EMT and invasion, to a greater extent than did wild-type Slug. The strong EMT inducer TGF-β elevated pPAK4 and pSlugS158 levels; PAK4 knockdown or introduction of a dominant-negative form of PAK4 inhibited both TGF-β-stimulated EMT and an increase in pSlugS158 levels.

The primary aim of this study was to identify gene signatures predictive of post-radiotherapy fatigue in prostate cancer patients. We employed Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to identify predictive genes using whole genome microarray data from 36 men with prostate cancer. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to determine functional networks of the predictive genes. Functional validation was performed using a T lymphocyte cell line, Jurkat E6.1. Cells were pretreated with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) agonist (DHPG), antagonist (MPEP), or control (PBS) for 20 min before irradiation at 8 Gy in a Mark-1 γ-irradiator. NF-κB activation was assessed using a NF-κB/Jurkat/GFP Transcriptional Reporter Cell Line. LDA achieved 83.3% accuracy in predicting post-radiotherapy fatigue. ""Glutamate receptor signaling"" was the most significant (p = 0.0002) pathway among the predictive genes. Functional validation using Jurkat cells revealed clustering of mGluR5 receptors as well as increased regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) production post irradiation in cells pretreated with DHPG, whereas inhibition of mGluR5 activity with MPEP decreased RANTES concentration after irradiation. DHPG pretreatment amplified irradiation-induced NF-κB activation suggesting a role of mGluR5 in modulating T cell activation after irradiation. These results suggest that mGluR5 signaling in T cells may play a key role in the development of chronic inflammation resulting in fatigue and contribute to individual differences in immune responses to radiation.

In this study, using microarray and gene set enrichment analysis, we discovered that PDEF upregulated epithelial/luminal differentiation-related genes while it suppressed stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related genes, especially Twist1. We also observed loss of PDEF and gain of Twist1 expression during prostate cancer progression in the TRAMP mouse model. Moreover, Twist1 knockdown resulted in upregulation of PDEF expression, suggesting a reciprocal regulation between PDEF and Twist1. Mechanistically, our ChIP-seq analysis revealed that PDEF directly regulated cytokeratin 18 (CK18) transcription through the GGAT motif within its putative promoter region. CK18 knockdown resulted in increased expression of Twist1, suggesting that PDEF regulated Twist1 in part via CK18. Our analysis of multiple clinical prostate cancer cohorts revealed an inverse relationship between PDEF expression and tumor grade, tumor metastasis, and poor patient survival. Furthermore, a two-gene signature of low PDEF and high Twist1 can better predict poor survival in prostate cancer patients than either gene alone. Collectively, our findings demonstrate PDEF inhibits prostate tumor progression, in part, by directly regulating transcription of CK18, and that PDEF/Twist1 expression could help distinguish between lethal and indolent prostate cancer.Implications: This study reports the novel findings that PDEF suppresses Twist1 partly via CK18 and that PDEF/Twist1 could help distinguish between lethal and indolent prostate cancer.Visual Overview: http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanres/16/9/1430/F1.large.jpg Mol Cancer Res; 16(9); 1430-40. ©2018 AACR.""","""['Fengtian Wang', 'Sweaty Koul', 'Prakash S T Shanmugam', 'Qin Dong', 'Hari K Koul']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Signatures of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF) in cancer.', 'Loss of PDEF, a prostate-derived Ets factor is associated with aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer: regulation of MMP 9 by PDEF.', 'Prostate derived ETS factor (PDEF): a putative tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'Mechanisms and functional consequences of PDEF protein expression loss during prostate cancer progression.', 'Structure-function studies of the bHLH phosphorylation domain of TWIST1 in prostate cancer cells.', 'SPDEF suppresses head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression by transcriptionally activating NR4A1.', 'Hippo pathway: Regulation, deregulation and potential therapeutic targets in cancer.', 'Prostate-Derived ETS Factor (PDEF) Modulates Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1) in Prostate Cancer Cells: A Potential Cross-Talk between PDEF and Hippo Signaling.', 'Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4 Gamma 1 (EIF4G1): a target for cancer therapeutic intervention?']"""

It not only significantly reduces treatment time, but also produces high-quality treatment plans. Current optimization approaches heavily rely on stochastic algorithms which are time-consuming and less repeatable. In this study, a novel approach is proposed to provide a high-efficient optimization algorithm for VMAT treatment planning.  Methods:   A progressive sampling strategy is employed for beam arrangement of VMAT planning. The initial beams with equal-space are added to the plan in a coarse sampling resolution. Fluence-map optimization and leaf-sequencing are performed for these beams. Then, the coefficients of fluence-maps optimization algorithm are adjusted according to the known fluence maps of these beams. In the next round the sampling resolution is doubled and more beams are added. This process continues until the total number of beams arrived. The performance of VMAT optimization algorithm was evaluated using three clinical cases and compared to those of a commercial planning system.  Results:   The dosimetric quality of VMAT plans is equal to or better than the corresponding IMRT plans for three clinical cases. The maximum dose to critical organs is reduced considerably for VMAT plans comparing to those of IMRT plans, especially in the head and neck case. The total number of segments and monitor units are reduced for VMAT plans. For three clinical cases, VMAT optimization takes < 5 min accomplished using proposed approach and is 3-4 times less than that of the commercial system.  Conclusions:   The proposed VMAT optimization algorithm is able to produce high-quality VMAT plans efficiently and consistently. It presents a new way to accelerate current optimization process of VMAT planning.""","""['Hui Yan', 'Jian-Rong Dai', 'Ye-Xiong Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Direct leaf trajectory optimization for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning with sliding window delivery.', 'A dosimetric comparison of the use of equally spaced beam (ESB), beam angle optimization (BAO), and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in head and neck cancers treated by intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'Knowledge-based planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A review of data-driven approaches.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy: a review of current literature and clinical use in practice.', 'The use of Hybrid Techniques in Whole-Breast Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Dosimetric Comparison between Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) and Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) for Dental Structures of Head and Neck Cancer Patients.', 'Whole brain radiotherapy using four-field box technique with tilting baseplate for parotid gland sparing.']"""

Even small errors in the scatter estimate can result in washout artifacts. Administration of diuretics can reduce these artifacts, but they may result in adverse events. Here, we investigated the ability of algorithmic modifications to mitigate washout artifacts and eliminate the need for diuretics or other interventions.  Materials and methods:   The model-based scatter algorithm was modified to account for PET/MRI scanner geometry and challenges of non-FDG tracers. Fifty-three clinical 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 whole-body images were reconstructed using the baseline scatter algorithm. For comparison, reconstruction was also processed with modified sampling in the single-scatter estimation and with an offset in the scatter tail-scaling process. None of the patients received furosemide to attempt to decrease the accumulation of radiopharmaceuticals in the bladder. The images were scored independently by three blinded reviewers using the 5-point Likert scale.  Results:   The scatter algorithm improvements significantly decreased or completely eliminated the washout artifacts. When comparing the baseline and most improved algorithm, the image quality increased and image artifacts were reduced for both 68Ga-RM2 and for 68Ga-PSMA-11 in the kidneys and bladder regions.

This study's purpose is to develop and evaluate an automated method for adaptation of IMPT plans in near real-time to the anatomy of the day. We developed an automated treatment plan adaptation method using (1) a restoration of spot positions (Bragg peaks) by adapting the energies to the new water equivalent path lengths; and (2) a spot addition to fully cover the target of the day, followed by a fast reference point method optimization of the spot weights resulting in a Pareto optimal plan for the daily anatomy. The method was developed and evaluated using 8-10 repeat CT scans of 11 prostate cancer patients, prescribing 55 Gy(RBE) (seminal vesicles and lymph nodes) with a boost to 74 Gy(RBE) (prostate). Applying the automated adaptation method resulted in a clinically acceptable target coverage (V 95% [Formula: see text] 98% and V 107% [Formula: see text] 2%) for 96% of the scans after a single iteration of adding 2500 spots. The other scans obtained target coverages with V 95% [Formula: see text] 98% and 2 < V 107% [Formula: see text] 5%. When using two spot-addition iterations, all scans obtained clinically acceptable results. Compared to the restoration method the adaptation lowered the mean dose to rectum and bladder with median values of 6.2 Gy(RBE) and 4.7 Gy(RBE) respectively. The largest improvements were obtained for V 45Gy(RBE) for both rectum and bladder, with median differences of 10.3%-point and 10.8%-point respectively, and maximum differences up to 22%-point. The two adaptation steps took on average 7.3 s and 1.7 min respectively. No user interaction was needed, making this fast and fully automated method a first step towards online adaptive proton therapy.""","""['Thyrza Jagt', 'Sebastiaan Breedveld', 'Rens van Haveren', 'Ben Heijmen', 'Mischa Hoogeman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Plan-library supported automated replanning for online-adaptive intensity-modulated proton therapy of cervical cancer.', 'Near real-time automated dose restoration in IMPT to compensate for daily tissue density variations in prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological impact of intensity modulated proton therapy and RapidArc planning for high-risk prostate cancer with seminal vesicles.', 'Online-adaptive versus robust IMPT for prostate cancer: How much can we gain?', 'Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Low-Dose Computed Tomography Scanning Protocols for Online Adaptive Proton Therapy of Head-and-Neck Cancers.', 'Integrating Structure Propagation Uncertainties in the Optimization of Online Adaptive Proton Therapy Plans.', 'Dosimetric Uncertainties in Dominant Intraprostatic Lesion Simultaneous Boost Using Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy.', 'Adaptive proton therapy.', 'Stability of daily rectal movement and effectiveness of replanning protocols for sparing rectal doses based on the daily CT images during proton treatment for prostate cancer.']"""

Antibodies targeting RANKL have recently been evaluated in combination with anti-CTLA4 in case reports of human melanoma and mouse models of cancer. However, the efficacy of anti-RANKL in combination with antibodies targeting other immune checkpoint receptors such as PD1 has not been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that blockade of RANKL improves anti-metastatic activity of antibodies targeting PD1/PD-L1 and improves subcutaneous growth suppression in mouse models of melanoma, prostate and colon cancer. Suppression of experimental lung metastasis following combination anti-RANKL with anti-PD1 requires NK cells and IFN-γ, whereas subcutaneous tumor growth suppression with this combination therapy is attenuated in the absence of T cells and IFN-γ. Furthermore, addition of anti-RANKL to anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 resulted in superior anti-tumor responses, irrespective of the ability of anti-CTLA4 isotype to engage activating FcR, and concurrent or delayed RANKL blockade was most effective. Early-during-treatment assessment reveals this triple combination therapy compared to dual anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 combination therapy further increased the proportion of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that can produce both IFN-γ and TNF. Finally, RANKL expression appears to identify tumor-specific CD8+ T cells expressing higher levels of PD1 which can be modulated by anti-PD1.

Ovo-like zinc finger 2 (Ovol2), a zinc finger transcription factor, is a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) driver that induces miR-200 expression in prostate cancer, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, little is known about the expression and function of MET in sarcomas, including OS. This study investigated the expression and clinicopathological significance of Ovol2 and its effect on MET in OS.  Patients and methods:   The Ovol2 expression in the tumor samples from patients with OS was examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). We then upregulated the Ovol2 expression in MG-63 and SW1353 cells, detected the expression of MET-associated proteins, and observed the effects of Ovol2 on OS cell proliferation, migration, and cytoskeleton reorganization using Cell Counting Kit-8, transwell invasion, and phalloidin dyeing assays, respectively. The correlation between zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and Ovol2 was assessed using the luciferase gene reporter assay in the MG-63 and SW1353 cells and IHC in the human OS tissue samples.  Results:   The Ovol2 protein overexpression was related to the clinical grade (P=0.02) and the recurrence and metastasis (P=0.02) of OS. Results of the in vitro experiments showed that Ovol2 overexpression can suppress cell migration and invasion and can regulate the expression levels of MET-associated proteins. Ovol2 suppresses ZEB1 expression by binding to the ZEB1 promoter. Ovol2 is concomitant with a reduced IHC expression of ZEB1 in human OS tissues.  Conclusion:   Ovol2 expression is associated with MET in OS cells and suppresses ZEB1 expression and OS progression.""","""['Jijun Liu', 'Qi Wu', 'Yonggui Wang', 'Yulong Wei', 'Hong Wu', 'Lijun Duan', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Yonggang Wu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['OVOL2-Mediated ZEB1 Downregulation May Prevent Promotion of Actinic Keratosis to Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'UBE2C, Directly Targeted by miR-548e-5p, Increases the Cellular Growth and Invasive Abilities of Cancer Cells Interacting with the EMT Marker Protein Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 1/2 in NSCLC.', 'MicroRNA-126 Inhibits Proliferation, Migration, Invasion, and EMT in Osteosarcoma by Targeting ZEB1.', 'Research models and mesenchymal/epithelial plasticity of osteosarcoma.', 'OVOL1/2: Drivers of Epithelial Differentiation in Development, Disease, and Reprogramming.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the expression, prognostic value and biological importance of OVO‑like proteins in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Ovo Like Zinc Finger 2 (OVOL2) Suppresses Breast Cancer Stem Cell Traits and Correlates with Immune Cells Infiltration.', 'Transcriptional Repression of Aerobic Glycolysis by OVOL2 in Breast Cancer.', 'Oxygen and metabolic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment influences metastasis homing.', 'Stationed or Relocating: The Seesawing EMT/MET Determinants from Embryonic Development to Cancer Metastasis.']"""

In this study, we confirm that repression of NEAT1 induces DNA damage, disturbs the cell cycle, and arrests the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. By taking advantage of the prostate cancer tumor transcriptome profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas, our data-mining pipeline identified a series of transcription factors (TF) whose regulatory activities on target genes depended on the level of NEAT1. Among them was putative TF CDC5L, which bound directly to NEAT1. Silencing NEAT1 in prostate cancer cells repressed the transcriptional activity of CDC5L, and RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses further revealed a handful of potential targets of CDC5L regulated by NEAT1 expression. One target of CDC5L, ARGN, mediated the strong phenotypic consequences of NEAT1 reduction, including DNA damage, cell-cycle dysregulation, and proliferation arrest. In summary, we have established the requirement of the CDC5L-AGRN circuit for the essential oncogenic role of NEAT1 in prostate cancer cells.Significance: An integrative methodology uncovers CDC5L-AGRN signaling as critical to the tumor-promoting function of long noncoding RNA NEAT1 in prostate cancer cells.

Recently, Magnetic Resonance (MR)-only radiotherapy has been proposed to simplify the workflow and reduce possible systematic uncertainties. A critical, determining factor in the accuracy of such an MR-only simulation will be accurate FM localisation using solely MR images.  Purpose:   The aim of this study is to evaluate the performances of manual MR-based FM localisation within a clinical environment.  Methods:   We designed a study in which 5 clinically involved radiation therapy technicians (RTTs) independently localised the gold FMs implanted in 16 prostate cancer patients in two scenarios: employing a single MR sequence or a combination of sequences. Inter-observer precision and accuracy were assessed for the two scenarios for localisation in terms of 95% limit of agreement on single FMs (LoA)/ centre of mass (LoA CM) and inter-marker distances (IDs), respectively.  Results:   The number of precisely located FMs (LoA <2 mm) increased from 38/48 to 45/48 FMs when localisation was performed using multiple sequences instead of single one. When performing localisation on multiple sequences, imprecise localisation of the FMs (3/48 FMs) occurred for 1/3 implanted FMs in three different patients. In terms of precision, we obtained LoA CM within 0.25 mm in all directions over the precisely located FMs. In terms of accuracy, IDs difference of manual MR-based localisation versus CT-based localisation was on average (±1 STD) 0.6 ±0.6 mm.  Conclusions:   For both the investigated scenarios, the results indicate that when FM classification was correct, the precision and accuracy are high and comparable to CT-based FM localisation. We found that use of multiple sequences led to better localisation performances compared with the use of single sequence. However, we observed that, due to the presence of calcification and motion, the risk of mislocated patient positioning is still too high to allow the sole use of manual FM localisation.

This is particularly important as most cancer survivors return to employment. Sleep disturbance is a largely overlooked potential contributor to these changes.  Methods:   Data from 9488 state employees participating in the Kansas State employee wellness program were used to assess cancer history, sleep disturbance, healthcare expenditures, work performance ratings, and absenteeism. Participants were categorized as having had no history of breast or prostate cancer, a past history only with no current cancer treatment, or current treatment for breast or prostate cancer. Indirect mediation analyses determined whether sleep disturbance mediated the influence of cancer status on outcomes.  Results:   Employees receiving treatment for breast or prostate cancer had significantly greater healthcare expenditures and absenteeism than those with a past history or no history of cancer (ps < .0001). Sleep disturbance significantly mediated the impact of cancer on healthcare expenditures and absenteeism (ps < .05), accounting for 2 and 8% of the impact of cancer on healthcare expenditure and missed full days of work, respectively.  Conclusions:   The worse outcomes observed among employees receiving treatment for breast and prostate cancer, the most common forms of cancer among women and men, were partially explained by the impacts of cancer and treatment for cancer on sleep disturbance.

Materials and methods:   We identified 484 PCa patients who received sADT for BCR after RP. Median follow-up was 82 months. Propensity score matching was performed based on preoperative PSA level, pathologic T stage, and Gleason score. Patients were assigned to two groups of 169 patients each, based on PSA levels at the time of sADT: Group A (without meeting of the definition of BCR) and Group B (after BCR). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox regression analyses were performed.  Results:   The median PSA level at sADT initiation was 0.12 ng/mL in group A and 0.42 ng/mL in group B. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that group A had favorable disease progression-free survival (DPFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), but did not have better cancer-specific survival (CSS) than group B. In subgroup analyses, group A showed better CSS rates in the non-organ confined PCa group. In Cox regression analyses, early sADT was associated significantly with DPFS and DMFS rates, however, did not correlate with CSS (p=0.107).  Conclusion:   Early sADT after RP improved DPFS and DMFS.

In this work, we first used the PWS to analyze the hierarchy of different types of prostate cancer cells, namely, C4-2, DU-145 and PC-3, by quantifying their average disorder strengths. Results expectedly showed that L d values increases in accordance with the increasing aggressiveness/tumorigenicity levels of these cells. Using the L d parameter, we then analyzed the chemoresistance properties of these prostate cancer cells to docetaxel drug compared to their chemosensitivity. Results show that chemoresistant cancer cells have increased L d values, that is, higher disorder strength, relative to chemosensitive cancer cells. Thus, use of the L d metric can be effective in determining the efficacy of particular chemotherapy.""","""['Huda M Almabadi', 'Prashanth K B Nagesh', 'Peeyush Sahay', 'Shiva Bhandari', 'Eugene C Eckstein', 'Meena Jaggi', 'Subhash C Chauhan', 'Murali M Yallapu', 'Prabhakar Pradhan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Biophotonics""","""['Optical detection of the structural properties of tumor tissue generated by xenografting of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells using partial wave spectroscopy (PWS).', 'Quantification of photonic localization properties of targeted nuclear mass density variations: Application in cancer-stage detection.', 'MicroRNA-34a Attenuates Paclitaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells via Direct Suppression of JAG1/Notch1 Axis.', 'The influence of chromosome density variations on the increase in nuclear disorder strength in carcinogenesis.', 'The transformation of the nuclear nanoarchitecture in human field carcinogenesis.', 'Photonics probing of pup brain tissue and molecular-specific nuclear nanostructure alterations due to fetal alcoholism via light scattering/localization approaches.', 'Spectroscopic Study on Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Biofilm in the Presence of the Aptamer-DNA Scaffolded Silver Nanoclusters.', 'Optical detection of the structural properties of tumor tissue generated by xenografting of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells using partial wave spectroscopy (PWS).', 'An optical study of drug resistance detection in endometrial cancer cells by dynamic and quantitative phase imaging.']"""

The purpose of this study was to determine standard values of the above parameters for cases of head and neck cancer (HNC) and prostate cancer (PC) in Japan. In this survey, a web-based questionnaire was sent to 48 facilities performing radiation therapy with tomotherapy in March 2016. The deadline for data submission was April 2016. In the questionnaire, the values of the planning parameters usually used were requested and 23 responses were received, representing a response rate of 48% (23/48). The FW selected was 2.5 cm in most facilities, and facilities with a tomoEDGE license used dynamic FW rather than fixed FW. Facilities changed the pitch based on FW, dose per fraction, or target offset more frequently in HNC than in PC. In contrast, >50% of the facilities used the magic number proposed by Kissick et al. Median preset MFs (range, min to max) in HNC and PC were 2.4 (1.8-2.8) and 2.0 (1.8-3.0), respectively, and MF values showed large variations between the facilities.

Separase is an emerging target for cancer therapy, and separase enzymatic inhibitors such as sepin-1 are currently being developed to treat separase-overexpressed tumors. Drug metabolism plays a critical role in the efficacy and safety of drug development, as well as possible drug-drug interactions. In this study, we investigated the in vitro metabolism of sepin-1 in human, mouse, and rat liver microsomes (RLM) using metabolomic approaches. In human liver microsomes (HLM), we identified seven metabolites including one cysteine-sepin-1 adduct and one glutathione-sepin-1 adduct. All the sepin-1 metabolites in HLM were also found in both mouse and RLM. Using recombinant CYP450 isoenzymes, we demonstrated that multiple enzymes contributed to the metabolism of sepin-1, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 as the major metabolizing enzymes. Inhibitory effects of sepin-1 on seven major CYP450s were also evaluated using the corresponding substrates recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration. Our studies indicated that sepin-1 moderately inhibits CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 with IC50 < 10 μM but weakly inhibits CYP2B6, CYP2C8/9, and CYP2D6 with IC50 > 10 μM. This information can be used to optimize the structures of sepin-1 for more suitable pharmacological properties and to predict the possible sepin-1 interactions with other chemotherapeutic drugs.""","""['Feng Li', 'Nenggang Zhang', 'Siddharth Gorantla', 'Scott R Gilbertson', 'Debananda Pati']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Stability and pharmacokinetics of separase inhibitor-Sepin-1 in Sprague-Dawley rats.', 'Toxicity study of separase inhibitor-Sepin-1 in Sprague-Dawley rats.', 'Data set on Separase Inhibitor-Sepin-1 toxicity on organ weights, hematology and clinical parameters in Sprague-Dawley rats.', 'In vitro metabolism of carbofuran by human, mouse, and rat cytochrome P450 and interactions with chlorpyrifos, testosterone, and estradiol.', 'Separase Inhibitor Sepin-1 Inhibits Foxm1 Expression and Breast Cancer Cell Growth.', 'The roles of Cyp1a2 and Cyp2d in pharmacokinetic profiles of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine and its metabolites in mice.', 'Metabolism of a Selective Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor Duloxetine in Liver Microsomes and Mice.', 'Metabolic profiling of norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine.', 'Metabolite Profiling in Anticancer Drug Development: A Systematic Review.', 'Metabolism of JQ1, an inhibitor of bromodomain and extra terminal bromodomain proteins, in human and mouse liver microsomes†.']"""

We investigate the effect of receptor-interacting protein kinase 4 (RIPK4) on NF-κB activation and BC progression.  Methods:   The expression of RIPK4 was examined in 25 cryopreserved paired bladder samples and 112 paraffin BC specimens. In vivo and in vitro assays were performed to validate effect of RIPK4 on NF-κB pathway-mediated BC progression.  Results:   High expression of RIPK4 was observed in BC tissues and was an independent predictor for poor overall survival. Up or downregulating the expression of RIPK4 enhanced or inhibited, respectively, the migration and invasion of BC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RIPK4 promoted K63-linked polyubiquitination of tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). RIPK4 also promoted nuclear localisation of NF-κB-p65, and maintained activation of NF-κB substantially, leading to upregulation of VEGF-A, ultimately promoting BC cell aggressiveness.  Conclusions:   Our data highlighted the molecular aetiology and clinical significance of RIPK4 in BC: upregulation of RIPK4 contributes to NF-κB activation, and upregulates VEGF-A, and BC progression.

Elucidation of the mechanism of tumor metastasis is therefore important in the development of novel, effective anti-cancer therapies to reduce cancer mortality. Interaction between cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment is a key factor in tumor metastasis. Using a co-culture assay system with human prostate cancer LNCaP cells and primary human prostate stromal cells, we identified epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) as a gene with elevated expression in the cancer cells. The orthotopic injection of LNCaP cells overexpressing EMP1 (EMP1-LNCaP cells) into the prostate of nude mice induced lymph node and lung metastases, while that of control LNCaP cells did not. EMP1-LNCaP cells had higher cell motility and Rac1 activity than control LNCaP cells. These results were also observed in other lines of cancer cells. We newly identified copine-III as an intracellular binding partner of EMP1. Knockdown of copine-III attenuated the increased cell motility and Rac1 activity in EMP1-LNCaP cells. Reduced cell motility and Rac1 activity following knockdown of copine-III in EMP1-LNCaP cells were recovered by re-expression of wild-type copine-III, but not of a copine-III mutant incapable of interacting with EMP1, suggesting the importance of the EMP1-copine-III interaction. Phosphorylated and activated Src and a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2 were found to be involved in the EMP1-induced enhancement of cell motility and Rac1 activation. Moreover, EMP1 was highly expressed in prostate cancer samples obtained from patients with higher Gleason score. These results demonstrate that upregulation of EMP1 significantly increases cancer cell migration that leads to tumor metastasis, suggesting that EMP1 may play an essential role as a positive regulator of tumor metastasis.""","""['Mohammad Khusni B Ahmat Amin', 'Akio Shimizu', 'Dimitar P Zankov', 'Akira Sato', 'Souichi Kurita', 'Masami Ito', 'Toshinaga Maeda', 'Tetsuya Yoshida', 'Tomohisa Sakaue', 'Shigeki Higashiyama', 'Akihiro Kawauchi', 'Hisakazu Ogita']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Cell-to-cell contact-mediated regulation of tumor behavior in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Two distinct mTORC2-dependent pathways converge on Rac1 to drive breast cancer metastasis.', 'Copine-III interacts with ErbB2 and promotes tumor cell migration.', 'Epithelial membrane protein 1 negatively regulates cell growth and metastasis in colorectal carcinoma.', 'The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1: a Janus-faced molecule in cellular signaling.', 'Catalytic domain-dependent and -independent transcriptional activities of the tumour suppressor histone H3K27 demethylase UTX/KDM6A in specific cancer types.', 'EMP1 as a Potential Biomarker in Liver Fibrosis: A Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Aberrant accumulation of NIK promotes tumor growth by dysregulating translation and post-translational modifications in breast cancer.', 'Longitudinal single-cell transcriptomics reveals distinct patterns of recurrence in acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Epithelial Membrane Protein 1 Promotes Sensitivity to RSL3-Induced Ferroptosis and Intensifies Gefitinib Resistance in Head and Neck Cancer.']"""

Blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference were measured before RP. Blood samples were also collected and tested for total PSA, fasting glucose, triglycerides and HDLs. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between MetS, defined according to Adult Treatment Panel III, and the risk of upgrading and upstaging), using the new Prognostic Grade Group (PGG) classification system.  Results:   Overall 148/400 (37%) men were diagnosed with MetS and most of these reported up-grading (54.5%) and up-staging (56.8%). These events were significantly more common in this population and MetS was a risk factor for up-staging and up-grading on multivariable analysis. Patients with MetS presented worst accuracy (72 vs. 84%; p = 0.001) and worst kappa coefficient of agreement (k = 0.439 ± 0.071 vs. k = 0.553 ± 0.071) between needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens when compared to patients without MetS.

Through iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics study, we identified 208 differentially expressed proteins in luteolin-treated PC-3 cells. Subsequent mechanistic analysis revealed that luteolin inhibits Wnt signaling by transcriptional upregulation of FZD6, and thereby suppressing the stemness of PCa cells. Furthermore, we identified FZD6 as a tumor suppressor that can abolish PCa stemness.

Methods:   We identified all incident cases of cancer in Denmark 2003 to 2012 (n=264.376) from the Danish Cancer Registry. Each person with cancer was matched by age, sex, and income with 10 randomly selected persons without cancer at index date (n=2.571.260). Linking data to the Danish Stroke Registry, we studied risk of ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke the year before (occult cancer) and after cancer diagnosis was established in the Danish Stroke Registry (manifest cancer) and stratified into the 15 most common cancer types related (lung, colon, bladder, rectum, pancreas, kidney, stomach, and head and neck cancer) and unrelated (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast, prostate, melanoma, central nervous system, ovary and endometrial) to smoking.  Results:   Risk of ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke was increased for both occult (relative risk, 1.75/2.00) and manifest cancers (relative risk, 1.30/1.41). For occult cancer, risk of ischemic stroke was increased for all of the smoking-related cancers, but among cancers unrelated to smoking, only lymphoma, central nervous system, and endometrial cancer were associated with increased risk of stroke; breast, prostate, melanoma, and ovarian cancers were not. For occult cancer, risk of hemorrhagic stroke was generally increased for smoking-related cancers while not for cancers unrelated to smoking. For manifest cancer, risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke was generally increased for cancers related to smoking while not for cancers unrelated to smoking.

The secondary aim was to evaluate the risk factors for infectious complications.  Study design:   Prospective observational study.  Methods:   Four hundred patients who underwent transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy were recruited. Patients orally received either 750 mg ciprofloxacin 60 min before the procedure or 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice a day for a duration of 7 days with the initial dose administered 24 h prior to the procedure. All patients were followed-up for 4 weeks after the transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy procedure for infectious complications. Screening of urine was carried out in all patients on the 3rd and 7th day after the procedure. Medical histories of all patients were collected prior to biopsy. Information on medical history include the following: hospitalization, urethral catheterization, or urinary tract infections within the past 12 months; antibiotic use within the last 3 months, prior urinary tract interventions, and previous transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy and Charlson comorbidity indexes. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was carried out using General Electric’s 7 MHz transrectal ultrasound device in the left decubitus position. Patients received one of the two ciprofloxacin-based prophylaxis regimens. Subsequent transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy to all patients were followed-up for 30 days. Further follow-up of patients was carried out on the second and fourth weeks after transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy, and symptoms, such as dysuria, rectal bleeding, fever, hematospermia, hematuria, and pollakiuria, were recorded.  Results:   Both groups presented similar baseline characteristics and medical history.

On the other hand, aryl urea moieties which are found in some tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Sorafenib and Linifanib have aroused recent attention as responsible for anticancer activities. The aims of this paper are to synthesize pyrrolo[ 2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives containing urea moiety and evaluate their anti-cancer activity against human lung cancer cell line (A549), prostate cancer cell line (PC3), human colon cancer cell line (SW480) and human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7).  Methods:   A series of new pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines containing urea moieties have been synthesized as Scheme 1. In vitro cytotoxicity of target compounds were evaluated against, SW480, PC3, A549 and MCF-7 human cancer cell lines using a MTT assay. In order to evaluate the mechanism of cytotoxic activity of compounds 9e, 10a and 10b, having the best cytotoxic activity, Annexin V binding assay, cell cycle analysis and western blot analysis were performed.  Results:   Among the target compounds, 10a (IC50 = 0.19 µM) was found to be the most potent derivative against PC3 cells. Compound 10b and 9e showed the strong cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and A549 cells with IC50 value of 1.66 µM and 4.55 µM, respectively. Flow cytometry data suggest that the cytotoxic activity of the compounds on cancer cells might be mediated by apoptosis revealing a significant increase in the percentage of late apoptotic cells and causing a cell cycle arrest at different stages. Western blot analysis of apoptosis marker demonstrated that these compounds induce apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway.  Conclusion:   Compound 9e displayed the strongest cytotoxicity against A549 cancer cell line, and induced late apoptosis in A549, as confirmed by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. In addition, compound 9e reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and enhanced expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, besides increased caspase-9 and caspase-3, as well as cleavage of PARP levels. These results suggest that compound 9e showed a cytotoxic effect in A549 cells through activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Further studies will be undertaken in our laboratory to improve cytotoxic activity of compound 9e and to identify the biological targets of 9e which are responsible for anticancer activity.""","""['Zühal Kilic-Kurt', 'Filiz Bakar-Ates', 'Bahriye Karakas', 'Özgür Kütük']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Design and synthesis of thienopyrimidine urea derivatives with potential cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activity against breast cancer cell line MCF-7.', 'Synthesis and anticancer activity of some pyrimidine derivatives with aryl urea moieties as apoptosis-inducing agents.', 'Design, Synthesis, biological Evaluation, and molecular docking studies of novel Pyrazolo3,4-dPyrimidine derivative scaffolds as potent EGFR inhibitors and cell apoptosis inducers.', '2-Anilinopyrimidine derivatives: Design, synthesis, in vitro anti-proliferative activity, EGFR and ARO inhibitory activity, cell cycle analysis and molecular docking study.', 'Pyrrolo2,3-dPyrimidines as Kinase Inhibitors.', 'Novel Bis- and Mono-Pyrrolo2,3-dpyrimidine and Purine Derivatives: Synthesis, Computational Analysis and Antiproliferative Evaluation.']"""

The aim of this study is to conjugate MCG with an albumin binding moiety to further improve the in vivo pharmacokinetics. MCG was conjugated with an Evans blue (EB) derivative for albumin binding and a DOTA chelator. PSMA positive (PC3-PIP) and PSMA negative (PC3) cells were used for both in vitro and in vivo studies.

DOTA-EB-MCG was also labeled with 90Y for radionuclide therapy. Besides tumor growth measurement, tumor response to escalating therapeutic doses were also evaluated by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy.

However, few examples of radiolabeled HBPLs have been described so far. One promising approach is the combination of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)- and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor subtype 1 (VPAC1R)-targeting peptides into one single radioligand since gastrinomas, prostate and breast cancer have been shown to concomitantly or complementarily overexpress both receptors. Here we report the design and synthesis of different HBPLs, comprising a GRPR-binding (BBN7-14) and a VPAC1R-targeting (PACAP-27) peptide. The heterodimers were varied with regard to the distance between the peptide binders and the steric rigidity of the systems. We radiolabeled the HBPLs 19-23 as well as their monomeric reference standards 26 and 27 with 68Ga, achieving radiochemical yields and purities of 95-99% and non-optimized molar activities of 25-61 GBq/μmol. We tested the stability of the radioligands and further evaluated them in vitro regarding their uptake in different prostate carcinoma cell lines (PC-3, DU-145 and VCaP cells). We found that the heterobivalent substances [68Ga]19 - [68Ga]23 showed comparable uptakes into the tumor cells to those of the respective monomers [68Ga]26 and [68Ga]27, indicating that both peptides are still able to address their target receptors. Furthermore, the obtained results indicate that in case of overall low receptor densities, heterobivalent peptides surpass peptide monomers in tumor cell uptake. Most importantly, it could be shown by blocking studies that both peptide parts of the HBPL [68Ga]19 contributed to tumor cell uptake in VCaP cells, expressing both receptor types. Thus, we describe here the first examples of HBPLs being able to address the GRPR as well as the VPAC1R and have the potential to - by several mechanisms - improve tumor targeting for several malignancies compared to monospecific peptides.""","""['Simon Lindner', 'Luise Fiedler', 'Björn Wängler', 'Peter Bartenstein', 'Ralf Schirrmacher', 'Carmen Wängler']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Design, Synthesis, In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluation of Heterobivalent SiFAlin-Modified Peptidic Radioligands Targeting Both Integrin αvβ3 and the MC1 Receptor-Suitable for the Specific Visualization of Melanomas?', 'Are heterobivalent GRPR- and VPAC1R-bispecific radiopeptides suitable for efficient in vivo tumor imaging of prostate carcinomas?', 'Design, Synthesis, In Vitro, and Initial In Vivo Evaluation of Heterobivalent Peptidic Ligands Targeting Both NPY(Y₁)- and GRP-Receptors-An Improvement for Breast Cancer Imaging?', 'Current State of Radiolabeled Heterobivalent Peptidic Ligands in Tumor Imaging and Therapy.', 'Radiolabeled heterobivalent peptidic ligands: an approach with high future potential for in vivo imaging and therapy of malignant diseases.', 'Peptide-based positron emission tomography probes: current strategies for synthesis and radiolabelling.', 'Development and Evaluation of a Peptide Heterodimeric Tracer Targeting CXCR4 and Integrin αvβ3 for Pancreatic Cancer Imaging.', 'Design, Synthesis, In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluation of Heterobivalent SiFAlin-Modified Peptidic Radioligands Targeting Both Integrin αvβ3 and the MC1 Receptor-Suitable for the Specific Visualization of Melanomas?', 'Advances in Development of Radiometal Labeled Amino Acid-Based Compounds for Cancer Imaging and Diagnostics.', 'New Frontiers in Molecular Imaging Using Peptide-Based Radiopharmaceuticals for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Two-year outcomes were reported previously. We report 4-year rates of intervention with radical therapy and further assess efficacy with biopsy results.  Materials and methods:   Prostate biopsies were mandated at 12 and 24 months. Thereafter patients were monitored for radical therapy with periodic biopsies performed according to the standard of care at each institution. Ablation efficacy was assessed by biopsy results overall and in field in the treated lobe or the lobe with index cancer.  Results:   Conversion to radical therapy was less likely in the ablation cohort than in the surveillance cohort, including 7% vs 32% at 2 years, 15% vs 44% at 3 years and 24% vs 53% at 4 years (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.21-0.46). Radical therapy triggers were similar in the 2 arms. Cancer progression rates overall and by grade were significantly lower in the ablation cohort (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29-0.59). End of study biopsy results were negative throughout the prostate in 50% of patients after ablation vs 14% after surveillance (risk difference 36%, 95% CI 28-44). Gleason 7 or higher cancer was less likely for ablation than for surveillance (16% vs 41%). Of the in field biopsies 10% contained Gleason 7 cancer after ablation vs 34% after surveillance.  Conclusions:   In this randomized trial of partial ablation of low risk prostate cancer photodynamic therapy significantly reduced the subsequent finding of higher grade cancer on biopsy. Consequently fewer cases were converted to radical therapy, a clinically meaningful benefit that lowered treatment related morbidity.""","""['Inderbir S Gill', 'Abdel-Rahmene Azzouzi', 'Mark Emberton', 'Jonathan A Coleman', 'Emmanuel Coeytaux', 'Avigdor Scherz', 'Peter T Scardino;PCM Study Group']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Re: Randomized Trial of Partial Gland Ablation with Vascular Targeted Phototherapy Versus Active Surveillance for Low Risk Prostate Cancer: Extended Followup and Analyses of Effectiveness.', 'Long-Term Outcomes after Deferred Radical Prostatectomy in Men Initially Treated with Active Surveillance.', 'Padeliporfin vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy versus active surveillance in men with low-risk prostate cancer (CLIN1001 PCM301): an open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial.', 'The Clinical Significance of Multiple Negative Surveillance Prostate Biopsies for Men on Active Surveillance-Does Cancer Vanish or Simply Hide?', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Focal therapy for localized prostate cancer: a critical appraisal of rationale and modalities.', 'Oncological results and cancer control definition in focal therapy\xa0for Prostate Cancer: a systematic review.', 'Narrative review-focal therapy: are we ready to change the prostate cancer treatment paradigm?', 'Active surveillance versus nonradical treatment for low-risk men with prostate cancer: a review.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: Recent advances, challenges and opportunities.', 'Focal therapy for prostate cancer: what is really needed to move from investigational to valid therapeutic alternative?-a narrative review.']"""

Methods:   Data in two waves of NHANES (2011-2014) were aggregated. Handgrip strength in kilogram (kg) was defined as the maximum value achieved using either hand. Two cognitive function tests were conducted among adults 60 years and older. The Animal Fluency Test (AFT) examines categorical verbal fluency (a component of executive function), and the Digital Symbol Substitution test (DSST) assesses processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory. Survey analysis procedures were used to account for the complex sampling design of the NHANES. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate associations of handgrip strength with cognitive test scores, adjusting for confounders (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking status, depressive symptoms and leisure time physical activity).  Results:   Among 383 cancer survivors (58.5% women, mean age = 70.9 years, mean BMI = 29.3 kg/m2), prevalent cancer types were breast (22.9%), prostate (16.4%), colon (6.9%) and cervix (6.2%). In women, each increase in kg of handgrip strength was associated with 0.20 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.33) higher score on AFT and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.30 to 1.35) higher score on DSST. In men, we observed an inverted U-shape association where cognitive function peaked at handgrip strength of 40-42 kg.  Conclusions:   Handgrip strength, a modifiable factor, appears to be associated with aspects of cognitive functions in cancer survivors.

However, in view of their minute variations in concentration, short lifetimes, and limited ranges of action, in situ generation of ROS with specific manipulations should be more effective for ROS-responsive drug delivery. Here we present a new delivery nanoplatform for photodynamic therapy (PDT) with on-demand drug release regulated by light irradiation. Rose bengal (RB) molecules, which exhibit a high yield of ROS generation, were encapsulated in a mixture of chitosan (CTS), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and branched polyethylenimine ( bPEI) with hydrophobic iron oxide nanoparticles through an oil-in-water emulsion method. The as-prepared magnetic nanoclusters (MNCs) with a tripolymer coating displayed high water dispersibility, efficient cellular uptake, and the cationic groups of CTS and bPEI were effective for RB loading through electrostatic interaction. The encapsulation efficiency of RB in MNCs could be further improved by increasing the amount of short bPEI chains. During the photodynamic process, controlled release of the host molecules (i.e., RB) or guest molecules (i.e., paclitaxel) from the bPEI-based nanoplatform was achieved simultaneously through a photooxidation action sensitized by RB. This approach promises specific payload release and highly effective PDT or PDT combined therapy in various cancer cell lines including breast (MCF-7 and multidrug resistant MCF-7 subline), SKOV-3 ovarian, and Tramp-C1 prostate. In in vivo xenograft studies, the nanoengineered light-switchable carrier also greatly augments its PDT efficacy against multidrug resistant MCF-7/MDR tumor as compared with free drugs. All the above findings suggest that the substantial effects of enhanced drug distribution for efficient cancer therapy was achieved with this smart nanocarrier capable of on demand drug release and delivery, thus exerting its therapeutic activity to a greater extent.""","""['Huan-Pu Yeh', 'Andrea C Del Valle', 'Ming-Chen Syu', 'Yu Qian', 'Yu-Cheng Chang', 'Yu-Fen Huang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Development of Photo-Activated ROS-Responsive Nanoplatform as a Dual-Functional Drug Carrier in Combinational Chemo-Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Photodynamic PEG-coated ROS-sensitive prodrug nanoassemblies for core-shell synergistic chemo-photodynamic therapy.', 'Light-Activated ROS-Responsive Nanoplatform Codelivering Apatinib and Doxorubicin for Enhanced Chemo-Photodynamic Therapy of Multidrug-Resistant Tumors.', 'Carbon nanotubes for delivery of small molecule drugs.', 'Utilisation of Targeted Nanoparticle Photosensitiser Drug Delivery Systems for the Enhancement of Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: Recent advances, challenges and opportunities.', 'Importance of Rose Bengal Loaded with Nanoparticles for Anti-Cancer Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Enzymatic synthesis of selenium-containing amphiphilic aliphatic polycarbonate as an oxidation-responsive drug delivery vehicle.', 'Triazine-Carbosilane Dendrimersomes Enhance Cellular Uptake and Phototoxic Activity of Rose Bengal in Basal Cell Skin Carcinoma Cells.', 'Photosensitizer-Functionalized Nanocomposites for Light-Activated Cancer Theranostics.']"""

In this study, stereological tools have been applied to find out if the cytokeratin18 (ck18) immunoexpression shows local changes in cancer compared to normal prostate. To verify if these changes are relevant to ascertain differences between normal (CTR) and cancer (Ca) cases, several parameters were estimated. Volume fraction of epithelium immunostained for ck18 (VV ck18), dispersion index of VV ck18, positional variance of VV ck18, and multiscale entropy analysis (MSE) to measure the tissue heterogeneity. The MSE values showing significant differences between CTR and Ca were employed in a discriminant analysis to determine if MSE was able to classify the cases in CTR and Ca groups. The findings obtained indicate that changes in the expression of ck18 by the cancer prostate are heterogeneous. The increase in local variability of ck18 immunoexpression can be related to the increase in heterogeneity of shape and size of the tumor acini. The asymmetry of distribution of the local values of VV ck18 along the axis of the space series may indicate the existence of anisotropy in the distribution of tumor acini. The increase in scale-dependent entropy for VV ck18 in cancer at the morphological level could be interpreted as the macroscopic expression of the same increase at the molecular level already described. The discriminant analysis shows that the dependence on the resolution for MSE values need to be taken into account to characterize the prostate cancer better.""","""['Luis Santamaría', 'Ildefonso Ingelmo', 'Bryan Sinues', 'Laura Martínez', 'Fernando Teba']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Histol Histopathol""","""['Diagnostic and prognostic impact of cytokeratin 18 expression in human tumors: a tissue microarray study on 11,952 tumors.', 'The diagnostic value of cytokeratin 5/6, 14, 17, and 18 expression in human non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Characterization of reactive stroma in prostate cancer: involvement of growth factors, metalloproteinase matrix, sexual hormones receptors and prostatic stem cells.', 'Subtle morphological and molecular changes in normal-looking epithelium in prostates with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer.', 'Prognostic value and clinicopathological significance of serum- and tissue-based cytokeratin 18 express level in breast cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Dimensional study of prostate cancer using stereological tools.', 'KRT18 is correlated with the malignant status and acts as an oncogene in colorectal cancer.', 'Targeted α-therapy of prostate cancer using radiolabeled PSMA inhibitors: a game changer in nuclear medicine.']"""

A recently developed method uses a medical wire functionalized with anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibodies for in vivo isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)1. A patient-matched cohort in non-metastatic prostate cancer showed that the in vivo isolation technique resulted in a higher percentage of patients positive for CTCs as well as higher CTC counts as compared to the current gold standard in CTC enumeration. As cells cannot be recovered from current medical devices, a new functionalized wire (referred to as Device) was manufactured allowing capture and subsequent detachment of cells by enzymatic treatment. Cells are allowed to attach to the Device, visualized on a microscope and detached using enzymatic treatment. Recovered cells are cytocentrifuged onto membrane-coated slides and harvested individually by means of laser microdissection or micromanipulation. Single-cell samples are then subjected to single-cell whole genome amplification allowing multiple downstream analysis including screening and target-specific approaches. The procedure of isolation and recovery yields high quality DNA from single cells and does not impair subsequent whole genome amplification (WGA). A single cell's amplified DNA can be forwarded to screening and/or targeted analysis such as array comparative genome hybridization (array-CGH) or sequencing. The device allows ex vivo isolation from artificial rare cell samples (i.e. 500 target cells spiked into 5 mL of peripheral blood). Whereas detachment rates of cells are acceptable (50 - 90%), the recovery rate of detached cells onto slides spans a wide range dependent on the cell line used (<10 - >50%) and needs some further attention.

Here, we show that loss of the male-specific histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 5D (KDM5D) encoded on the Y chromosome epigenetically modifies histone methylation marks and alters gene expression, resulting in aggressive prostate cancer. Fluorescent in situ hybridization demonstrated that segmental or total deletion of the Y chromosome in prostate cancer cells is one of the causes of decreased KDM5D mRNA expression. The result of ChIP-sequencing analysis revealed that KDM5D preferably binds to promoter regions with coenrichment of the motifs of crucial transcription factors that regulate the cell cycle. Loss of KDM5D expression with dysregulated H3K4me3 transcriptional marks was associated with acceleration of the cell cycle and mitotic entry, leading to increased DNA-replication stress. Analysis of multiple clinical data sets reproducibly showed that loss of expression of KDM5D confers a poorer prognosis. Notably, we also found stress-induced DNA damage on the serine/threonine protein kinase ATR with loss of KDM5D. In KDM5D-deficient cells, blocking ATR activity with an ATR inhibitor enhanced DNA damage, which led to subsequent apoptosis.

Here we propose a method for evaluating the effects of these errors by using the correlation between fractions on tumour control probability (TCP) in carbon-ion therapy. This method incorporates the concept of equivalent stochastic dose (Cranmer-Sargison and Zavgorodni 2005 Phys. Med. Biol. 50 4097-109), which was defined as a dose that gives the mean expected survival fraction (SF) for the stochastically variable dose. The mean expected SFs were calculated while considering the correlation between fractions for setup and range errors. By using this SF, equivalent stochastic clinical doses (ESCD), which are weighted by relative biological effectiveness, of lung and prostate cases with varying errors were derived. To account for spatial dose heterogeneity, equivalent uniform stochastic clinical doses (EUSCD) were obtained by using the mean expected SF in the volume of interest. TCP curves were calculated for each assumed error considering inter-patient sensitivity variation with a fractionation effect. ESCD distributions, EUSCD, and TCP curves were affected by the inter-fraction correlation and the contribution of setup and range errors. Irradiated areas that could be affected by these errors can be visualized quantitatively by using the ESCD distribution. TCP curves for the errors of various conditions converged around the TCP curve in nominal conditions by using the EUSCD. EUSCD correlated well with TCP in setup and range errors when the errors were not large and was comparatively stably insensitive to uncertain biological parameters. The proposed evaluation method with EUSCD and TCP calculations will be useful to indicate tumour doses to improve realistic dose distributions in carbon-ion therapy.""","""['Makoto Sakama', 'Nobuyuki Kanematsu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Application of the equivalent uniform stochastic dose (EUSD) to TCP calculations incorporating dose uncertainty and fractionation effects.', 'A robustness analysis method with fast estimation of dose uncertainty distributions for carbon-ion therapy treatment planning.', 'A TCP model incorporating setup uncertainty and tumor cell density variation in microscopic extension to guide treatment planning.', 'EUD-based radiotherapy treatment plan evaluation: incorporating physical and Monte Carlo statistical dose uncertainties.', 'Robust spatiotemporal fractionation schemes in the presence of patient setup uncertainty.', 'Bevacizumab is an effective treatment for symptomatic cerebral necrosis after carbon ion therapy for recurrent intracranial malignant tumours: A case report.']"""

Methods:   Intrafractional motion data of 21 prostate patients receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy was acquired with an electromagnetic tracking system. Target trajectories of 734 fractions were analyzed per delivered multileaf-collimator segment in five motion metrics: three-dimensional displacement, distance from beam axis (DistToBeam), and three orthogonal components. Time-resolved dose calculations have been performed by shifting the target according to the sampled motion for the following scenarios: without adaptation, online-repositioning with a minimum threshold of 3 mm, and an offline approach using a modified field order applying horizontal before vertical beams. Change of D95 (targets) or V65 (organs at risk) relative to the static case, that is, ΔD95 or ΔV65, was extracted per fraction in percent. Correlation coefficients (CC) between the motion metrics and the dose metrics were extracted. Mean of patient-wise CC was used to evaluate the correlation of motion metric and dosimetric changes. Mean and standard deviation of the patient-wise correlation slopes (in %/mm) were extracted.  Results:   For ΔD95 of the prostate, mean DistToBeam per fraction showed the highest correlation for all scenarios with a relative change of -0.6 ± 0.7%/mm without adaptation and -0.4 ± 0.5%/mm for the repositioning and field order strategies. For ΔV65 of the bladder and the rectum, superior-inferior and posterior-anterior motion components per fraction showed the highest correlation, respectively. The slope of bladder (rectum) was 14.6 ± 5.8 (15.1 ± 6.9) %/mm without adaptation, 14.0 ± 4.9 (14.5 ± 7.4) %/mm for repositioning with 3 mm, and 10.6 ± 2.5 (8.1 ± 4.6) %/mm for the field order approach.  Conclusions:   The correlation slope is a valuable concept to estimate dosimetric deviations from static plan quality directly based on the observed motion.

GPCRs are triggered by ligand molecules outside the cell and activate internal signal transduction pathways driving cellular responses. The receptor signals are desensitized by receptor internalization and this mechanism can be exploited for the specific delivery of ligand-linked drug molecules directly into cells. Detailed expression analysis in cancer tissue can inform the design of GPCR-ligand decorated drug carriers for active tumor cell targeting. The active targeting process utilizes ligand receptor interactions leading to binding and in most cases internalization of the ligand-attached drug carrier resulting in effective targeting of cancer cells. In this report public microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository was used to identify overexpressed GPCRs in prostate and breast cancer tissues. The analyzed data confirmed previously known cancer receptor associations and identified novel candidates for potential active targeting.

Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been widely used as a biomarker for PCa diagnosis, its results can be controversial. Therefore, new biomarkers are needed to enhance the clinical management of PCa. From publicly available microarray data, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by meta-analysis with RankProd. Genetic algorithm optimized artificial neural network (GA-ANN) was introduced to establish a diagnostic prediction model and to filter candidate genes. The diagnostic and prognostic capability of the prediction model and candidate genes were investigated in both GEO and TCGA datasets. Candidate genes were further validated by qPCR, Western Blot and Tissue microarray. By RankProd meta-analyses, 2306 significantly up- and 1311 down-regulated probes were found in 133 cases and 30 controls microarray data. The overall accuracy rate of the PCa diagnostic prediction model, consisting of a 15-gene signature, reached up to 100% in both the training and test dataset. The prediction model also showed good results for the diagnosis (AUC = 0.953) and prognosis (AUC of 5 years overall survival time = 0.808) of PCa in the TCGA database. The expression levels of three genes, FABP5, C1QTNF3 and LPHN3, were validated by qPCR. C1QTNF3 high expression was further validated in PCa tissue by Western Blot and Tissue microarray. In the GEO datasets, C1QTNF3 was a good predictor for the diagnosis of PCa (GSE6956: AUC = 0.791; GSE8218: AUC = 0.868; GSE26910: AUC = 0.972). In the TCGA database, C1QTNF3 was significantly associated with PCa patient recurrence free survival (P < .001, AUC = 0.57). In this study, we have developed a diagnostic and prognostic prediction model for PCa. C1QTNF3 was revealed as a promising biomarker for PCa. This approach can be applied to other high-throughput data from different platforms for the discovery of oncogenes or biomarkers in different kinds of diseases.""","""['Qi Hou', 'Zhi-Tong Bing', 'Cheng Hu', 'Mao-Yin Li', 'Ke-Hu Yang', 'Zu Mo', 'Xiang-Wei Xie', 'Ji-Lin Liao', 'Yan Lu', 'Shigeo Horie', 'Ming-Wu Lou']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""EBioMedicine""","""['ZNF154 is a promising diagnosis biomarker and predicts biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'Random forest-based modelling to detect biomarkers for prostate cancer progression.', 'Biomarker microRNAs for prostate cancer metastasis: screened with a network vulnerability analysis model.', 'Assessment of miR-98-5p, miR-152-3p, miR-326 and miR-4289 Expression as Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'A modern era of personalized medicine in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', ""Pediatric Crohn's disease diagnosis aid via genomic analysis and machine learning."", 'Eye Melanoma Diagnosis System using Statistical Texture Feature Extraction and Soft Computing Techniques.', 'Susceptibility identification for seasonal influenza A/H3N2 based on baseline blood transcriptome.', 'Identification by genetic algorithm optimized back propagation artificial neural network and validation of a four-gene signature for diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer.', 'Establishment and analysis of a disease risk prediction model for the systemic lupus erythematosus with random forest.']"""

Patients' selection and follow-up was performed by the combination of systemic biopsies (SB) and mpMRI±TB. Reclassification was defined by a Gleason score>6 and/or a maximum tumor length>5mm.  Results:   Overall, 29 patients (22.1 %) were reclassified. Reclassification free survival rate was 93 % and 70 % at 1 year and 4 years respectively. Reclassification independent risk factors were: PSA density>0.15ng/mL/cm3 (RR=2.75), PSA doubling time<3 years (RR=9.28), suspicious lesion on MRI diagnosis (RR=2.79) and occurrence of MRI progression during follow-up (RR=2).

Methods and materials:   The primary endpoints were biochemical (nadir plus 2 ng/mL) and metastatic failure. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate competing risks analyses were performed. The cumulative incidence rates were estimated to describe the cumulative risk of the events of interest. The magnitude of the increased risk was estimated using univariate and multivariate subdistribution hazard ratios.  Results:   A total of 185 patients had undergone prospective treatment (123 with high risk and 62 with intermediate risk). The median age was 71 years (range 56-82). Of the patients, 20.5% had mpMRI-determined (mrT) stage mrT1-mrT2b, 37.3% had mrT2c, 31% had mrT3a, and 11.2% had mrT3b. The Gleason score was 6 in 22.2%, 7 in 49.5%, and 8 to 10 in 28.2%. The median baseline prostate-specific antigen was 11.7 ng/mL (range 2.9-153). After a median follow-up period of 46 months (range 16-70), 15 patients (8.1%) had developed biochemical failure and 9 (4.9%) had developed distant metastases. None of the traditional clinical variables (prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, clinical stage) predicted for biochemical or metastatic failure. The multivariate competing risk analysis demonstrated that the 2 independent predictors of biochemical failure were the presence of extraprostatic extension (EPE; mrT3a; hazard ratio [HR] 4.80; P = .035) and presence of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI; mrT3b; HR 10.17; P = .003) on mpMRI. The only independent predictor of metastatic failure was the percentage of positive cores on prostate biopsy (HR 13.95; P = .014). After excluding patients with SVI, the only independent predictor of biochemical failure and metastatic failure was the presence of EPE (stage mrT3a) on mpMRI (HR 4.36; P = .042; and HR 5.76; P = .010, respectively).  Conclusions:   The pretreatment mpMRI findings might be more accurate independent predictors of the outcome than traditional clinical variables.

This MMP9/NGAL complex has been associated with metastasis. MMP9 and NGAL are detected in the urine of patients afflicted with many different types of cancer, including prostate cancer. The effects of p53, NF-κB and the androgen receptor (AR) on the expression of NGAL was examined in four prostate cancer cell lines. Prostate cancer cell lines that are AR negative and expressed either mutant or no p53 (DU145 and PC3) displayed higher levels of NGAL expression compared to the prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and 22Rv-1) which are AR positive and express wild type (WT) p53. Introduction of WT-p53 into the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, resulted in reduction of the levels of NGAL expression. Conversely, introduction of dominant negative (DN) p53 or a retroviral construct expressing NF-κB into LNCaP cells increased NGAL expression. NGAL expression had functional effects on the ability of the cells to form colonies in soft agar. Whereas suppression of WT-53 in LNCaP cells increased NGAL expression, the introduction of WT-p53 suppressed NGAL transcription activity in PC3 prostate cells which normally express high level of NGAL. NF-κB and p53 were determined to regulate NGAL expression by positive and negative mechanisms, respectively.

Many cases of androgen-dependent prostate cancer develop resistance during treatment with bicalutamide. Therefore, the effect of bicalutamide on androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells is of clinical interest. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effects of the anticancer drug bicalutamide on LNCaP prostate cancer cells by using a proteomics approach. Based on the results, 314 proteins were differentially expressed between the LNCaP and LNCaP treated with bicalutamide. The apoptosis pathway associated with differentially expressed proteins was shown in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome pathway mapper. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome pathway mapper results revealed that the fodrin-mediated apoptosis pathway is associated with the actions of bicalutamide and Western blotting was performed to validate these results. Impact statement We studied bicalutamide's anticancer action by using proteomics. The effect of bicalutamide on androgen-exposed LNCaP cells was also studied.

Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1), a zinc-finger transcription factor, is considered to play an important role in the development of several neuroendocrine precursor cells. Its diagnosis value has only recently been evaluated. In this study, we analyzed the expression of INSM in three high-throughput RNA sequencing data sets and performed INSM1 immunohistochemistry on a large series of prostatic SCCs and non-neuroendocrine prostate tissues. To validate its possible utility as a diagnostic marker, the performance of chromogranin and synaptophysin was used for comparison. We found INSM1 mRNA is up-regulated in neuroendocrine prostate carcinoma samples from the published data sets. The results were verified by the immunohistochemistry performance. INSM1 was positive in 92.3% of prostatic SCCs, compared with 53.8% positive for chromogranin, and 84.6% positive for synaptophysin. INSM1 was also stained all of the mixed SCC-acinar adenocarcinomas and metastatic SCCs progression from acinar adenocarcinoma. Only 3.4% of benign prostate tissues and 4.0% of prostate adenocarcinomas were INSM1 positive.

We modeled combination drug therapy in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells using mixture design response surface methodology (MDRSM), a statistical technique designed to optimize compositions that we applied in a novel manner to design combinations of chemotherapeutics. Conventional chemotherapeutics (mitoxantrone, cabazitaxel, and docetaxel) and natural bioactive compounds (resveratrol, piperlongumine, and flavopiridol) were used in 12 different combinations containing three drugs at varying concentrations. Cell viability and cell cycle data were collected and used to plot response surfaces in MDRSM that identified the most effective concentrations of each drug in combination. MDRSM allows for extrapolation of data from three or more compounds in variable ratio combinations, unlike the Chou-Talalay method. MDRSM combinations were compared with combination index data from the Chou-Talalay method and were found to coincide. We propose MDRSM as an effective tool in devising combination treatments that can improve treatment effectiveness and increase treatment personalization, because MDRSM measures effectiveness rather than synergism, potentiation, or antagonism.""","""['Richard Oblad', 'Hayden Doughty', 'John Lawson', 'Merrill Christensen', 'Jason Kenealey']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Pharmacol""","""['Utilizing mixture design response surface methodology to determine effective combinations of plant derived compounds as prostate cancer treatments.', 'γ-Tocotrienol and α-Tocopherol Ether Acetate Enhance Docetaxel Activity in Drug-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Everolimus (RAD001) sensitizes prostate cancer cells to docetaxel by down-regulation of HIF-1α and sphingosine kinase 1.', 'Cabazitaxel for Hormone-Relapsed Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With a Docetaxel-Containing Regimen: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'A systematic review of the effectiveness of docetaxel and mitoxantrone for the treatment of metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Piperlongumine Induces Cellular Apoptosis and Autophagy via the ROS/Akt Signaling Pathway in Human Follicular Thyroid Cancer Cells.', 'Utilizing mixture design response surface methodology to determine effective combinations of plant derived compounds as prostate cancer treatments.', 'Piperlongumine, a Potent Anticancer Phytotherapeutic, Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis In Vitro and In Vivo through the ROS/Akt Pathway in Human Thyroid Cancer Cells.', 'γ-Tocotrienol and α-Tocopherol Ether Acetate Enhance Docetaxel Activity in Drug-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Although active surveillance presents several advantages for both patients and the health care system, all eligible patients do not adopt this approach. Our goal was to evaluate the factors that influence physicians to recommend active surveillance and the barriers that impact adherence to this approach.  Methods:   Focus groups (n = 5) were held with physicians who provided care for men with low-risk prostate cancer and had engaged in conversations with men and their families about active surveillance. The experience of health care professionals (HCPs) was captured to understand their decisions in proposing active surveillance and to reveal the barriers and facilitators that affect the adherence to this approach. A content analysis was performed on the verbatim transcripts from the sessions.  Results:   Although physicians agreed that active surveillance is a suitable approach for low-risk prostate cancer patients, they were concerned about the rapidly evolving and non-standardized guidelines for patient follow-up. They pointed out the need for additional tools to appropriately identify proper patients for whom active surveillance is the best option. Urologists and radiation-oncologists were keen to collaborate with each other, but the role of general practitioner remained controversial once patients were referred to a specialist.  Conclusions:   Integration of more reliable tools and/or markers in addition to more specific guidelines for patient follow-up would increase the confidence of both patients and physicians in the choice of active surveillance.""","""['Kittie Pang', 'Margaret Fitch', 'Veronique Ouellet', 'Simone Chevalier', 'Darrel E Drachenberg', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Jean-Baptiste Lattouf', 'Alan So', 'Simon Sutcliffe', 'Simon Tanguay', 'Fred Saad', 'Anne-Marie Mes-Masson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['Perceptions of Barriers Towards Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: Results From a National Survey of Radiation Oncologists and Urologists.', 'Selecting men diagnosed with prostate cancer for active surveillance using a risk calculator: a prospective impact study.', ""Canadian Men's perspectives about active surveillance in prostate cancer: need for guidance and resources."", 'Patient and disease factors affecting the choice and adherence to active surveillance.', 'Avoiding obsolescence in advanced prostate cancer management: a guide for urologists.', ""Factors that influence clinicians' decisions to decrease active surveillance monitoring frequency or transition to watchful waiting for localised prostate cancer: a qualitative study."", 'Perceived barriers to the adoption of active surveillance in low-risk prostate cancer: a qualitative analysis of community and academic urologists.', 'Comparing Perspectives of Canadian Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer and Health Care Professionals About Active Surveillance.', 'Defining and Measuring Adherence in Observational Studies Assessing Outcomes of Real-world Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Balancing Confounding and Generalizability Using Observational, Real-world Data: 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score Assay Effect on Active Surveillance.']"""

However, it is completely unclear whether other forms of cancer are also affected by AP and if residential green spaces could lower cancer incidence rates in general. Therefore, the objective was to estimate whether AP and green space are associated with several cancer types.  Methods:   The analysis was based on routine health care data from around 1.9 million people from Saxony who were free of cancer in 2008 and 2009. Incident cancer cases (2010-2014) of mouth and throat, skin (non-melanoma skin cancer - NMSC), prostate, breast, and colorectum were defined as: (1) one inpatient diagnosis, or (2) two outpatient diagnoses in two different quarters within one year and a specific treatment or death within two quarters after the diagnosis. Exposures, derived from freely available 3rd party data, included particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 μm (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (N02) as well as green space (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI). Associations between air pollutants, green space, and cancer incidence were assessed by multilevel Poisson models. Age, sex, physician contacts, short- and long-term unemployment, population density, and having an alcohol-related disorder were considered as potential confounders.  Results:   Three thousand one hundred seven people developed mouth and throat cancer, 33,178 NMSC, 9611 prostate cancer, 9577 breast cancer, and 11,975 colorectal cancer during the follow-up period (2010-2014). An increase in PM10 of 10 μg/m3 was associated with a 53% increase in relative risk (RR) of mouth and throat cancer and a 52% increase in RR of NMSC. Prostate and breast cancer were modestly associated with PM10 with an increase in RR of 23 and 19%, respectively. The associations with N02 were in the same direction as PM10 but the effect estimates were much lower (7-24%). A 10% increase in NDVI was most protective of mouth and throat cancer (- 11% RR) and of NMSC (- 16% RR). Colorectal cancer was not affected by any of the exposures.  Conclusions:   In addition to the studies carried out so far, this study was able to provide evidence that higher ambient AP levels increase the risk of mouth and throat cancer as well as of NMSC and that a higher residential green space level might have a protective effect for NMSC in areas with low to moderate UV intensity.

Irreversible ligation of 7 to papain, a model of CTSL, was analyzed with mass spectroscopy, and the major peak shown at 24283 au corresponds to that of papain-1-Re(CO)3(phen). Compound 7 was well tolerated by DU-145 prostate cancer cells, with toxicity evident only at high concentrations. Treatment of DU-145 cells with 7 followed by imaging via confocal microscopy showed substantial intracellular fluorescence that can be blocked by the known CTSL inhibitor CLIK-148, consistent with the ability of 7 to label CTSL in living cells.

Little is known about the optimal treatment sequence for men with progressive disease on D-ADT.  Patient and methods:   Retrospective analysis of consecutive mHSPC patients treated with ≥3 cycles of D-ADT at Cleveland Clinic and University of Wisconsin-Madison was undertaken. The primary end-points included radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) and OS with first-line treatment for metastatic CRPC (mCRPC).  Results:   Final analysis included 136 patients, median age 65 (range 35-86), 77% GS ≥ 8, and 79% with high-volume disease who received ≥3 cycles of docetaxel. Undetectable PSA values at 12 and 24 months were observed in 32% and 25% of patients, respectively. Median time to CRPC (biochemical, clinical, or radiographic) was 19.6 months (16.6-22.6). Sixty patients (44%) received ≥1 treatment for CRPC: 48 patients (80%) received a second-generation hormonal therapy (sHT). Among these, 22 received abiraterone acetate, 20 enzalutamide, and six a novel CYP-17 inhibitor on trial (ASN-001). Five patients (8%) received sipuleucel-T; four (7%) radium-223, five (8%) chemotherapy (two carboplatin-based, two single agent cabazitaxel, one single agent docetaxel) and three other.

The choice of first therapy for mCRPC was independent of GS (P = 0.909), visceral disease (P = 0.690) and time to CRPC (P = 0.844). Longer OS correlated with time to CRPC (P = 0.010) and first treatment for CRPC with sHT (P = 0.005).

In these couples, high doses of folic acid lead to UMFA (un-metabolized folic acid) syndrome.  Methods:   Thirty couples with fertility problems lasting for at least 4 years, such as recurrent fetal loss, premature ovarian insufficiency, or abnormal sperm parameters, with two thirds of them having failed assisted reproductive technology (ART) attempts were included in this program. For all couples, at least one of the partners was a carrier of one of the two main MTHFR isoforms. Most of the women had been previously treated unsuccessfully with high doses of folic acid (5 mg/day), according to what is currently proposed in the literature. The couples carrying one of the isoforms were treated for 4 months with 5-MTHF, at a dose of 600 micrograms per day, before attempting conception or starting another attempt at ART. The duration of treatment corresponding to an entire cycle of spermatogenesis is approximately 74 days.  Results:   In this first series of 33 couples, one couple was not followed-up, and two are still currently under treatment. No adverse effects were observed. Thirteen of the couples conceived spontaneously, the rest needing ART treatment in order to achieve pregnancy. Only three couples have, so far, not succeeded.  Conclusion:   The conventional use of large doses of folic acid (5 mg/day) has become obsolete. Regular doses of folic acid (100-200 μg) can be tolerated in the general population but should be abandoned in the presence of MTHFR mutations, as the biochemical/genetic background of the patient precludes a correct supply of 5-MTHF, the active compound. A physiological dose of 5-MTHF (800 μg) bypasses the MTHFR block and is suggested to be an effective treatment for these couples. Moreover, it avoids potential adverse effects of the UMFA syndrome, which is suspected of causing immune dysfunction and other adverse pathological effects such as cancer (especially colorectal and prostate).""","""['Edouard J Servy', 'Laetitia Jacquesson-Fournols', 'Marc Cohen', 'Yves J R Menezo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Assist Reprod Genet""","""['Methyltetrahydrofolate vs Folic Acid Supplementation in Idiopathic Recurrent Miscarriage with Respect to Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase C677T and A1298C Polymorphisms: A Randomized Controlled Trial.', '5-Methyltetrahydrofolate reduces blood homocysteine level significantly in C677T methyltetrahydrofolate reductase single-nucleotide polymorphism carriers consulting for infertility.', 'Association of MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism with pregnancy outcomes in IVF/ICSI-ET recipients with adequate synthetic folic acid supplementation.', 'Folate, folic acid and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate are not the same thing.', 'Folic acid and L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate: comparison of clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.', 'Follicular homocysteine as a marker of oocyte quality in PCOS and the role of micronutrients.', 'Variations in folate prescriptions for patients with the MTHFR genetic polymorphisms: A case series study.', 'Doubly bi-allelic variants of MTHFR and MTHFD1 in a Chinese patient with hyperhomocysteinemia and failure of folic acid therapy.', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency and high-dose FA supplementation disrupt embryonic development of energy balance and metabolic homeostasis in zebrafish.', 'MTHFR SNPs (Methyl Tetrahydrofolate Reductase, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) C677T and A1298C Prevalence and Serum Homocysteine Levels in >2100 Hypofertile Caucasian Male Patients.']"""

However, the paucity of antigens that are tumor selective has resulted, on occasion, in ""on-target, off-tumor"" toxicities. To address this issue, we developed an approach to render T cells responsive to an expression pattern present exclusively at the tumor by using a trio of novel chimeric receptors. Using pancreatic cancer as a model, we demonstrate how T cells engineered with receptors that recognize prostate stem cell antigen, TGFβ, and IL4, and whose endodomains recapitulate physiologic T-cell signaling by providing signals for activation, costimulation, and cytokine support, produce potent antitumor effects selectively at the tumor site. In addition, this strategy has the benefit of rendering our cells resistant to otherwise immunosuppressive cytokines (TGFβ and IL4) and can be readily extended to other inhibitory molecules present at the tumor site (e.g., PD-L1, IL10, and IL13).Significance: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates how sophisticated engineering approaches can be utilized to both enhance the antitumor efficacy and increase the safety profile of transgenic T cells by incorporating a combination of receptors that ensure that cells are active exclusively at the tumor site.

Methods:   From 2008 onwards, we consecutively enrolled, at a single institution in Italy, men undergoing 12-core transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy. Demographic, clinical, and pathological data were collected. The risk of prostate cancer (PCa) was calculated according to the PCPT-RC, ERSPC-RC, Karakiewicz, Kawakami, and Chun nomograms. Calibration and discrimination were assessed using calibration plots and receiver operator characteristic analysis. Additionally, decision curve analyses (DCA) were used to assess the net benefit associated with the adoption of each model.  Results:   Overall, 1,100 patients were evaluated, 39% presented PCa and out of them 26% presented high-grade PCa (defined as Gleason ≥ 4 + 3). All the models showed good discrimination capacities for PCa on receiver operator characteristic analysis (area under the curve: 0.59-0.72) On calibration curves the ERSCP, the PCPT and the Chun nomogram underestimated the risk of PC while the Kawakami overestimated it. At DCA, the net benefit associated with the use of the models in the prediction of cancer was observed when the threshold probability was between 40% and 60%.

Methods and materials:   Ten patients underwent low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy with radioactive seeds stranded with positive magnetic resonance-signal seed markers and were scanned on a Siemens 1.5T Aera. MRI comprised a fully balanced steady-state free precession sequence with two 18-channel external pelvic array coils with and without a rigid two-channel endorectal coil. The fully sampled data sets were retrospectively subsampled with increasing acceleration factors and reconstructed with parallel imaging and compressed sensing algorithms. The images were assessed in a blinded reader study by board-certified care providers. Rating scores were compared for statistically significant differences between reconstruction types.  Results:   Images reconstructed from subsampling up to an acceleration factor of 4 with PICS demonstrated consistently sufficient quality for dosimetry with no apparent loss of SNR, anatomy depiction, or seed/marker conspicuity when compared to the fully sampled images. Images obtained with acceleration factors of 5 or 6 revealed reduced spatial resolution and seed marker contrast. Nevertheless, the reader study revealed that images obtained with an acceleration factor of up to 5 and reconstructed with PICS were adequate-to-good for postimplant dosimetry.  Conclusions:   Combined parallel imaging and compressed sensing can substantially reduce scan time in fully balanced steady-state free precession imaging of the prostate while maintaining adequate-to-good image quality for postimplant dosimetry. The saved scan time can be used for multiple signal averages and improved SNR, potentially obviating the need for an endorectal coil in MRI-based postimplant dosimetry.""","""['Jeremiah W Sanders', 'Hao Song', 'Steven J Frank', 'Tharakeswara Bathala', 'Aradhana M Venkatesan', 'Mitchell Anscher', 'Chad Tang', 'Teresa L Bruno', 'Wei Wei', 'Jingfei Ma']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Fully Balanced SSFP Without an Endorectal Coil for Postimplant QA of MRI-Assisted Radiosurgery (MARS) of Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Study.', 'Impact of MRI-based postimplant dosimetric assessment in prostate brachytherapy using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images.', 'Effect of pulse sequence parameter selection on signal strength in positive-contrast MRI markers for MRI-based prostate postimplant assessment.', 'The American Brachytherapy Society recommendations for permanent prostate brachytherapy postimplant dosimetric analysis.', 'Doctor, a patient is on the phone asking about the endorectal coil!', 'Intracardiac MR imaging (ICMRI) guiding-sheath with amplified expandable-tip imaging and MR-tracking for navigation and arrythmia ablation monitoring: Swine testing at 1.5 and 3T.', 'Deep learning application engine (DLAE): Development and integration of deep learning algorithms in medical imaging.', 'Fully Balanced SSFP Without an Endorectal Coil for Postimplant QA of MRI-Assisted Radiosurgery (MARS) of Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Study.', 'Deformable registration of x ray and MRI for postimplant dosimetry in low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Contrast Agents Delivery: An Up-to-Date Review of Nanodiagnostics in Neuroimaging.']"""

Preclinical data suggest synergy between olaparib and androgen pathway inhibitors. We aimed to assess the efficacy of olaparib plus the androgen pathway inhibitor abiraterone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer regardless of HRR mutation status.  Methods:   We carried out this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 41 urological oncology sites in 11 countries across Europe and North America. Eligible male patients were aged 18 years or older with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had previously received docetaxel and were candidates for abiraterone treatment. Patients were excluded if they had received more than two previous lines of chemotherapy, or had previous exposure to second-generation antihormonal drugs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice or web response system, without stratification, to receive oral olaparib 300 mg twice daily or placebo. All patients received oral abiraterone 1000 mg once daily and prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS; based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 and Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria). Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients, and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of olaparib or placebo. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01972217, and is no longer recruiting patients.  Findings:   Between Nov 25, 2014, and July 14, 2015, 171 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 142 patients were randomly assigned to receive olaparib and abiraterone (n=71) or placebo and abiraterone (n=71). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Sept 22, 2017. Median rPFS was 13·8 months (95% CI 10·8-20·4) with olaparib and abiraterone and 8·2 months (5·5-9·7) with placebo and abiraterone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·65, 95% CI 0·44-0·97, p=0·034). The most common grade 1-2 adverse events were nausea (26 [37%] patients in the olaparib group vs 13 [18%] patients in the placebo group), constipation (18 [25%] vs eight [11%]), and back pain (17 [24%] vs 13 [18%]). 38 (54%) of 71 patients in the olaparib and abiraterone group and 20 (28%) of 71 patients in the placebo and abiraterone group had grade 3 or worse adverse events, including anaemia (in 15 [21%] of 71 patients vs none of 71), pneumonia (four [6%] vs three [4%]), and myocardial infarction (four [6%] vs none). Serious adverse events were reported by 24 (34%) of 71 patients receiving olaparib and abiraterone (seven of which were related to treatment) and 13 (18%) of 71 patients receiving placebo and abiraterone (one of which was related to treatment). One treatment-related death (pneumonitis) occurred in the olaparib and abiraterone group.  Interpretation:   Olaparib in combination with abiraterone provided clinical efficacy benefit for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer compared with abiraterone alone. More serious adverse events were observed in patients who received olaparib and abiraterone than abiraterone alone. Our data suggest that the combination of olaparib and abiraterone might provide an additional clinical benefit to a broad population of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Purpose:   To examine the feasibility of a web-based intervention (RiseTx) for reducing SED and increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among PCS undergoing ADT. Secondary outcomes include changes in SED, MVPA, light intensity PA, and quality of life.  Methods:   Forty-six PCS were recruited from two cancer centres in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between July 2015-October 2016. PCS were given an activity tracker (Jawbone), access to the RiseTx website program, and provided with a goal of increasing walking by 3000 daily steps above baseline levels over a 12-week period. A range of support tools were progressively released to reduce SED time (e.g., self-monitoring of steps) during the five-phase program. Objective measures of SED, MVPA, and daily steps were compared across the 12-week intervention using linear mixed models.  Results:   Of the 46 PCS enrolled in the study, 42 completed the SED intervention, representing a 9% attrition rate. Measurement completion rates were 97 and 65% at immediately post-intervention and 12-week follow-up for all measures, respectively. Overall adherence was 64% for total number of logins (i.e., > 3 visits each week). Sample mean age was 73.2 ± 7.3 years, mean BMI was 28.0 ± 3.0 kg/m2, mean number of months since diagnosis was 93.6 ± 71.2, and 72% had ADT administered continuously. Significant reductions of 455.4 weekly minutes of SED time were observed at post-intervention (p = .005). Significant increases of + 44.1 for weekly minutes of MVPA was observed at immediately post-intervention (p = .010). There were significant increases in step counts of + 1535 steps from baseline to post-intervention (p < .001).  Conclusions:   RiseTx was successful in reducing SED and increasing MVPA in PCS. PCS were satisfied with the intervention and its components. Additional strategies may be needed though for maintenance of behavior change. The next step for RiseTx is to replicate these findings in a larger, randomized controlled trial that will have the potential for reducing sedentary time among PCS.

The aim of our study is to assess the quality of prostate radiotherapy (RT) treatment reporting in randomized controlled trials in prostate cancer.  Methods:   We searched MEDLINE for randomized trials of prostate cancer, published from 1996 to 2016 and included prostate RT as one of the intervention arms. We assessed if the investigators reported the ten criteria adequately in the trial reports: RT dose prescription method; RT dose-planning procedures; organs at risk (OAR) dose constraints; target volume definition, simulation procedures; treatment verification procedures; total RT dose; fractionation schedule; conduct of quality assurance (QA) as well as presence or absence of deviations in RT treatment planning and delivery. We performed multivariate logistic regression to determine the factors that may influence the quality of reporting.  Results:   We found 59 eligible trials. There was significant variability in the quality of reporting. Target volume definition, total RT dose and fractionation schedule were reported adequately in 97% of included trials. OAR constraints, simulation procedures and presence or absence of deviations in RT treatment planning and delivery were reported adequately in 30% of included trials. Twenty-four trials (40%) reported seven criteria or more adequately. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that trials that published their quality assurance results and cooperative group trials were more likely to have adequate quality in reporting in at least seven criteria.

It is usually associated with ANCA vasculitis and anti-GBM disease. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in a patient with ANCA and anti-GBM negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis is rare and optimal management is unknown.  Patient concerns:   An 85-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prostate cancer and recently diagnosed pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis presented to our emergency department with worsening dyspnea and pedal edema for several days. Clinical presentation and radiological studies were suggestive of fluid overload but he developed worsening respiratory failure despite hemodialysis.  Diagnoses:   Bronchoscopy confirmed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies were negative. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary renal syndrome - diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in the setting of ANCA and anti-GBM negative pauci-immune glomerulonephritis.  Interventions:   Patient was started on intravenous pulse steroids, cyclophosphamide and received seven sessions of plasmapheresis.  Outcomes:   There was an improvement in patient's respiratory status and repeat bronchoscopy at the end of treatment did not show diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Lessons:   Pauci-immune crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis is usually associated with the presence of ANCA, however, ANCA may be absent in 10% of these cases. Immunosuppression is the mainstay of treatment for ANCA and anti-GBM associated PRS. This case highlights the importance of immunosuppression and plasmapheresis in patients with ANCA negative vasculitis due to presence of unidentified serum antibodies.

The effects of different extraction conditions on extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized. Under optimum experimental conditions, a calibration graph exhibited linearity over the range of 0.05-25 μmol/L with a correlation coefficient (r2 ) of 0.9990. The enrichment factor was 168, and the detection limit was 0.02 μmol/L.

In the largest known series, our objective was to describe the prevalence of RCC among patients with GISTs over 26 years at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed MSKCC's prospectively maintained sarcoma and RCC databases and identified all patients with both RCC and GIST between 1980 and 2016. Demographic and clinicopathological characteristics were obtained.  Results:   A total of 9/405 (2.2%) GIST patients were identified with RCC, with a mean follow-up of 9.2 (range 3.8-28.4) years. Five out of nine (55.6%) patients had RCC and GIST diagnosis within 6 months of each other. Mean RCC tumor size was 3.0 (range 1.8-8) cm and 8/9 (88.9%) patients were RCC stage 1. A total of 4/9 (44.4%) patients had papillary RCC (pRCC) histology, 5/9 (55.6%) had additional alternative malignancies, and 4/9 (44.4%) had primary small bowel GIST.  Conclusions:   Our series suggests a possible association of RCC with GISTs. In addition, we found a high frequency of pRCC histology, alternative malignancies, and small bowel GISTs in co-occurring RCC-GIST patients. Further investigation to identify genetic mutations, in this population, would assist in surveillance and treatment.""","""['Shawn J Mendonca', 'Alejandro Sanchez', 'Kyle A Blum', 'Mazyar Ghanaat', 'Mahyar Y Kashan', 'Nicole Benfante', 'Paul Russo', 'Jonathan A Coleman', 'Aimee M Crago', 'A Ari Hakimi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Surg Oncol""","""['The association of genitourinary cancer among Saudi patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors and a systematic literature review.', 'Increased risk of additional cancers among patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors: A population-based study.', 'Targeted ultra-deep sequencing unveils a lack of driver-gene mutations linking non-hereditary gastrointestinal stromal tumors and highly prevalent second primary malignancies: random or nonrandom, that is the question.', 'Additional Primary Malignancies in Patients with Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST): A Clinicopathologic Study of 260 Patients with Molecular Analysis and Review of the Literature.', 'Cancer biology of small gastrointestinal stromal tumors (<2\xa0cm): What is the risk of malignancy?', 'The association of genitourinary cancer among Saudi patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors and a systematic literature review.', 'Malignancies associated with GIST: a retrospective study with molecular analysis of KIT and PDGFRA.']"""

This study examined associations between the place of residence at cancer diagnosis (urban vs rural) and patient ratings of access to care among older cancer survivors participating in Medicare-managed care.  Methods:   Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results -Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (SEER-CAHPS) linked data, which included SEER data and Medicare CAHPS patient experience surveys, this study identified urban (n = 6140) and rural Medicare beneficiaries (n = 686) aged ≥ 65 years with a breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer diagnosis who had completed a Medicare CAHPS survey between 1998 and 2013. Multivariable models examined associations between survivor residence at the time of diagnosis and CAHPS measures of timeliness and ease of getting care.  Results:   Respondents who resided in urban areas (vs rural) at the time of their cancer diagnosis rated their care significantly lower for Getting Care Quickly (b = -2.27; standard error = 0.95; P = .02). Although there were no overall significant differences for Getting Needed Care, there was a significant interaction between race/ethnicity and residence (P = .04): both non-Hispanic black and Hispanic respondents residing in rural areas rated Getting Needed Care lower than those respondents residing in urban areas.  Conclusions:   In contrast to prior studies, these findings suggest that rural survivors report more timely care than those in urban areas, but accessing needed care may be more challenging for racial/ethnic minority rural survivors. Future examination of specific barriers for urban and racial/ethnic minority rural survivors is warranted to ensure equitable access to quality cancer care.

We previously proposed the SNP Interaction Pattern Identifier (SIPI) approach to evaluate 45 SNP interaction patterns/patterns. SIPI is statistically powerful but suffers from a large computation burden. For large-scale studies, it is necessary to use a powerful and computation-efficient method. The objective of this study is to develop an evidence-based mini-version of SIPI as the screening tool or solitary use and to evaluate the impact of inheritance mode and model structure on detecting SNP-SNP interactions.  Results:   We tested two candidate approaches: the 'Five-Full' and 'AA9int' method. The Five-Full approach is composed of the five full interaction models considering three inheritance modes (additive, dominant and recessive). The AA9int approach is composed of nine interaction models by considering non-hierarchical model structure and the additive mode. Our simulation results show that AA9int has similar statistical power compared to SIPI and is superior to the Five-Full approach, and the impact of the non-hierarchical model structure is greater than that of the inheritance mode in detecting SNP-SNP interactions. In summary, it is recommended that AA9int is a powerful tool to be used either alone or as the screening stage of a two-stage approach (AA9int+SIPI) for detecting SNP-SNP interactions in large-scale studies.

Cox proportional hazards models estimated associations between circulating metabolites and prostate cancer mortality for 1 SD differences (log-metabolite scale), adjusted for age, year of diagnosis, and disease stage. Associations between metabolite chemical classes and survival were examined through pathway analysis, and Cox models assessed the relationship with a sterol/steroid metabolite principal component analysis factor score. Elevated serum N-oleoyl taurine was significantly associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratios [HR] = 1.72 per 1 SD, p < .00008, Bonferroni-corrected threshold = 0.05/625; HR = 3.6 for highest vs lowest tertile, p < .001). Pathway analyses revealed a statistically significant association between lipids and prostate cancer death (p < .006, Bonferroni-corrected threshold = 0.05/8), and sterol/steroid metabolites showed the strongest chemical sub-class association (p = .0014, Bonferroni-corrected threshold = 0.05/45).

Animals were sacrificed at the end of the study and HMGB2 immunohistochemistry was performed. HMGB2 expression in least one prostate lobe was significantly increased by all four prostate carcinogens compared with the controls. In contrast, the four chemicals that were not carcinogenic in the prostate did not cause HMGB2 up-regulation.

Materials and methods:   Data were obtained from a prospectively maintained cohort of men undergoing AS between 1995 and 2016 at our institution. All men satisfied the low-risk criteria: Gleason score <7, <4 positive cores, <50% involvement of any core, and prostate-specific antigen level <10.0 ng/dL. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards were used to assess statin exposure at diagnosis and at time to pathological progression (failing to meet the low-risk criteria at biopsy) and therapeutic progression (first of pathological progression or initiation of definitive therapy). Reclassification at confirmatory biopsy (first postdiagnostic biopsy) and progression beyond confirmatory biopsy were evaluated independently.  Results:   Low-risk criteria were met by 797 men. Reclassification at the confirmatory biopsy occurred in 194 (24%) men, 51 (26%) of whom were statin users.

In this study, we compared the addition of abiraterone, docetaxel, bisphosphonate, celecoxib or combinations to standard ADT vs. ADT alone for patients with mHSPC in terms of overall survival (OS), failure-free survival (FFS), and adverse events.  Methods:   We searched PubMed and performed a network meta-analysis to generate probabilistic inferences and provide efficacy rankings in terms of posterior hazard ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI), surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), probability better than competing treatments, and probability best.  Results:   Seven trials were included (LATITUTE, STAMPEDE, CHAARTED, GETUG-AFU15, ZAPCA, CALGB 90202, and MRC PR05).

Therefore, we conducted a detailed analysis of effects of radiation by clonogenic assay and immunofluorescence stain for p-H2AX foci. The downstream of CD44/ERBB2 and DNA damage repair proteins was detected by western blot. The results reveal that CD44 interacted with ERBB2, the downstream of CD44/ERBB2 was p-p38 when Cap cells were irradiated. Among the pathways, homologous recombination (HR) related proteins Mre11 and Rad50 were involved in CD44/ERBB2/p-p38 mediated radioresistance in Cap.

In this study, p63 immunoexpression was investigated in 90 canine PCs and 20 normal prostate tissues (NT). The p63 expression pattern in luminal or basal cells was confirmed in a selected group of 26 PCs and 20 NT by immunohistochemistry and/or Western blotting assays. Eleven canine PC samples aberrantly expressing p63 (p63+) in secretory cells were compared with 15 p63 negative (p63-) cases in the context of several molecular markers (high molecular weight cytokeratin-HMWC, CK8/18, CK5, AR, PSA, chromogranin, NKX3.1, PTEN, AKT and C-MYC). P63+ samples were positive for CK5, HMWC and CK8/18 and negative for PSA, NKX3.1, PTEN and chromogranin. Five p63+ PCs were negative for AR, and the remaining six samples had low AR expression. In contrast, p63- PC showed AR and PSA positive expression in all 15 samples. Only five p63- PCs were positive for CK5. Both p63+ and p63- PC samples showed higher cytoplasmic AKT expression and nuclear C-MYC staining in comparison with normal tissues. Metastatic (N = 12) and non-metastatic (N = 14) PCs showed similar immunoexpression for all markers tested. In contrast to human PC, canine PC aberrantly expressing p63 showed higher expression levels of HMWC and CK5 and lower levels of NKX3.1. Canine p63+ PC is a very rare PC group showing a distinct phenotype compared to typical canine PC, including AR and PSA negative expression. Although in a limited number of cases, p63 expression was not associated with metastasis in canine PC, and cytoplasmic p63 expression was observed in animals with shorter survival time, similar to human PC cases.""","""['Carlos Eduardo Fonseca-Alves', 'Priscila Emiko Kobayashi', 'Luis Gabriel Rivera Calderón', 'Sérgio Luis Felisbino', 'Jaqueline de Carvalho Rinaldi', 'Sandra Aparecida Drigo', 'Silvia Regina Rogatto', 'Renée Laufer-Amorim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Different Growth Patterns of Canine Prostatic Carcinoma Suggests Different Models of Tumor-Initiating Cells.', 'Prostate adenocarcinomas aberrantly expressing p63 are molecularly distinct from usual-type prostatic adenocarcinomas.', 'Alterations of C-MYC, NKX3.1, and E-cadherin expression in canine prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Expression of the epidermal stem cell marker p63/CK5 in cutaneous papillomas and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas of dogs.', 'Lifelong exercise training promotes the remodelling of the immune system and prostate signalome in a rat model of prostate carcinogenesis.', 'The mitotic regulator polo-like kinase 1 as a potential therapeutic target for c-Myc-overexpressing canine osteosarcomas.', 'A Review on Canine and Feline Prostate Pathology.', 'Comparative Pathobiology of Canine and Human Prostate Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions.', 'P-Glycoprotein and Androgen Receptor Expression Reveals Independence of Canine Prostate Cancer from Androgen Hormone Stimulation.']"""

Systematic studies exploring PSMA uptake in thyroid tumors are lacking. The aim of this pilot study was to assess PSMA expression in patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (mDTC).  Materials and methods:   Ten patients of mDTC harboring 32 lesions (5 men; age range, 38-65 years; mean age, 50 years) underwent prospective evaluation with radioiodine (I), F-FDG PET, and Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET scans as per the institution protocol. PSMA expression (SUVmax) was compared with F-FDG and I scan findings in all patients.  Results:   Lesions were radioiodine avid in 8 patients, whereas 2 were classified as thyroglobulin elevation with negative iodide scintigraphy (TENIS) patients. All patients with iodine-avid metastatic disease showed substantial PSMA uptake. PSMA PET detected 30/32 total lesions (93.75%; SUVmax ranging from 4.86 to 101.81 with median SUVmax of 31.35), whereas FDG PET/CT was positive in 23/32 lesions (81.85%). Twenty-one (70%) of 30 lesions that showed PSMA expression were localized to the bones. PSMA localized a lesion in each of the 2 TENIS patients similar to FDG PET scan.  Conclusions:   Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT is a potentially useful imaging modality in patients of mDTC with most (70%) of PSMA expressing metastasis being localized to the bones. PSMA PET/CT could be useful for identifying patients with limited therapeutic options (eg, TENIS) who might benefit from PSMA-targeted radionuclide therapy.""","""['Priyanka Verma', 'Gaurav Malhotra', 'Ritesh Agrawal', 'Sunita Sonavane', 'Vilas Meshram', 'Ramesh V Asopa']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression in Patients With Differentiated Thyroid Cancer With Thyroglobulin Elevation and Negative Iodine Scintigraphy Using 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT.', 'Imaging of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression in Metastatic Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Using 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Thyroid Cancer.', 'PET/CT in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer.', 'Incidental Detection of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma in Tc-99\xa0m PSMA Imaging in a Case with Negative FNA Result.', 'Value of serum free prostate-specific antigen density in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'The complementary role of PSMA expression and 18FFDG PET/CT in predicting thyroid cancer outcome: from black and white to shades of gray, in the era of precision oncology.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression predicts recurrence of papillary thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy.', 'PSMA Expression in Solid Tumors beyond the Prostate Gland: Ready for Theranostic Applications?']"""

Results:   The diagnoses of patients were breast cancer (49.3%), colon cancer (25.4%), ovarian cancer (14.9%), and other cancers (10.4%). Serum survivin levels were significantly higher in cancer patients than healthy subjects (196.23 pg/ml vs. 117.73 pg/ml, respectively, P = 0.019).

The optimal cut-off value of serum survivin was determined at >120.8 pg/ml, and its serum levels above this cut-off value were associated with 4.198 times increased risk of cancer.  Conclusion:   Our study results may suggest that high serum survivin levels can show 4 times increased risk of cancer in a subject with a high suspicion of cancer. Furthermore, survivin level was not influenced with demographic characteristics of breast, gastric, colorectal, prostate, ovarian cancer, and glioblastome multiforme.""","""['Meral Gunaldi', 'Nilgun Isiksacan', 'Hakan Kocoglu', 'Yildiz Okuturlar', 'Omur Gunaldi', 'Turkan Ozturk Topcu', 'Mehmet Karabulut']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther""","""['Importance of serum levels of angiopoietin-2 and survivin biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Survivin expression and serum levels in pancreatic cancer.', 'Clinical significance of serum survivin in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Diagnostic value of survivin for malignant pleural effusion: a clinical study and meta-analysis.', 'Survivin splice variants and their diagnostic significance.', 'Beneficial Proapoptotic Effect of Heterobasidion Annosum Extract in Colorectal Cancer Xenograft Mouse Model.', 'Cellular Concentration of Survivin and Caspase 3 in Habitual Tobacco Chewers with and without Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma in South Indian Rural Population-A Case Control Study.', 'Starch-Coated Magnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Affinity Purification of Recombinant Proteins.', 'MiR-483 Promotes Colorectal Cancer Cell Biological Progression by Directly Targeting NDRG2 through Regulation of the PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'RFWD3 Participates in the Occurrence and Development of Colorectal Cancer via E2F1 Transcriptional Regulation of BIRC5.']"""

A number of common, low-penetrance prostate cancer risk loci have been identified through GWAS. Here we apply the Bayesian multivariate variable selection algorithm JAM to fine-map 84 prostate cancer susceptibility loci, using summary data from a large European ancestry meta-analysis. We observe evidence for multiple independent signals at 12 regions and 99 risk signals overall. Only 15 original GWAS tag SNPs remain among the catalogue of candidate variants identified; the remainder are replaced by more likely candidates. Biological annotation of our credible set of variants indicates significant enrichment within promoter and enhancer elements, and transcription factor-binding sites, including AR, ERG and FOXA1. In 40 regions at least one variant is colocalised with an eQTL in prostate cancer tissue. The refined set of candidate variants substantially increase the proportion of familial relative risk explained by these known susceptibility regions, which highlights the importance of fine-mapping

We aimed to determine whether EVs from prostate cells with altered CD9 and CD151 expression could influence cellular behaviour and increase the metastatic capabilities of non-tumourigenic prostate cells. EVs were isolated by ultrafiltration and characterised for their tetraspanin expression and size distribution. iTRAQ was used to identify differences between RWPE1 and tetraspanin-modified RWPE1 EV proteomes, showing an enrichment in protein degradation pathways. Addition of EVs from RWPE1 cells with reduced CD9 or increased CD151 abundance resulted in increased invasion of RWPE1 cells, and increased migration in the case of high CD151 abundance. We have been able to show that alteration of CD9 and CD151 on prostate cells alters the proteome of their resultant EVs, and that these EVs can enhance the migratory and invasive capabilities of a non-tumourigenic prostate cellular population.

Methods: The study cohort was selected from 206 men with localized unfavorable-risk PC randomized to radiation therapy (RT) or RT plus 6 months of ADT between 1995 and 2001. A total of 54 men who received salvage ADT for PSA failure after a median follow-up of 18.72 years following randomization defined the study cohort. The Fine-Gray competing risks regression model was used to analyze whether the timing of salvage ADT was associated with an increased risk of PCSM after adjusting for age, comorbidity, known PC prognostic factors, and previously identified interactions. Results: After a median follow-up of 5.68 years (interquartile range, 3.05-9.56) following salvage ADT, 49 of the 54 men (91%) died, of which 27 from PC (54% of deaths). Increasing PSA-DT as a continuous covariate (per month increase) was associated with a decreasing risk of PCSM (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.82; P=.02). Among men with a long PSA-DT (≥6 months), initiating salvage ADT later (PSA level >12 ng/mL, upper quartile) versus earlier was associated with an increased risk of PCSM (adjusted HR, 8.84; 95% CI, 1.99-39.27; P=.004), whereas for those with a short PSA-DT (<6 months; adjusted HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.38-3.54; P=.79) this was not true.

How it contributes to prostate cancer progression is not fully understood, although it is known to confer a growth advantage and promote cell survival. Here, we report that FGFR1 tyrosine kinase reprograms the energy metabolism of prostate cancer cells by regulating the expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozymes. FGFR1 increased LDHA stability through tyrosine phosphorylation and reduced LDHB expression by promoting its promoter methylation, thereby shifting cell metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis.

Significant upregulation of AKR1C3 is observed in CRPC patient samples and derived CRPC cell lines. As AKR1C3 is a downstream steroidogenic enzyme synthesizing intratumoral testosterone (T) and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the enzyme represents a promising therapeutic target to manage CRPC and combat the emergence of resistance to clinically employed androgen deprivation therapy. Herein, we demonstrate the antineoplastic activity of a potent, isoform-selective and hydrolytically stable AKR1C3 inhibitor (E)-3-(4-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)-3-(3-phenylpropanamido)phenyl)acrylic acid (KV-37), which reduces prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo and sensitizes CRPC cell lines (22Rv1 and LNCaP1C3) toward the antitumor effects of enzalutamide. Crucially, KV-37 does not induce toxicity in nonmalignant WPMY-1 prostate cells nor does it induce weight loss in mouse xenografts. Moreover, KV-37 reduces androgen receptor (AR) transactivation and prostate-specific antigen expression levels in CRPC cell lines indicative of a therapeutic effect in prostate cancer. Combination studies of KV-37 with enzalutamide reveal a very high degree of synergistic drug interaction that induces significant reduction in prostate cancer cell viability via apoptosis, resulting in >200-fold potentiation of enzalutamide action in drug-resistant 22Rv1 cells. These results demonstrate a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of drug-resistant CRPC that invariably develops in prostate cancer patients following initial treatment with AR antagonists such as enzalutamide.

Despite improvements in outcomes, patients still succumb to the disease due to the development of resistance. Further complicating the situation is lack of a well-defined treatment sequence and potential for cross-resistance between therapies. We have developed several models representing CRPC with acquired therapeutic resistance. Here, we utilized these models to assess putative cross-resistance between treatments. We find that resistance to enzalutamide induces resistance to abiraterone and vice versa, but resistance to neither alters sensitivity to taxanes. Acquired resistance to docetaxel induces cross-resistance to cabazitaxel but not to enzalutamide or abiraterone. Correlating responses with known mechanisms of resistance indicates that AR variants are associated with resistance to NGATs, whereas the membrane efflux protein ABCB1 is associated with taxane resistance. Mechanistic studies show that AR variant-7 (AR-v7) is involved in NGAT resistance but not resistance to taxanes. Our findings suggest the existence of intra cross-resistance within a drug class (i.e., within NGATs or within taxanes), whereas inter cross-resistance between drug classes does not develop. Furthermore, our data suggest that resistance mechanisms differ between drug classes. These results may have clinical implications by showing that treatments of one class can be sequenced with those of another, but caution should be taken when sequencing similar classed drugs. In addition, the development and use of biomarkers indicating resistance will improve patient stratification for treatment.

Nevertheless, their clinical application is often adversely impacted by their short plasma half-life. Controlled long-term delivery of small biologicals has become a challenge because of their hydrophilic properties and in some cases their limited stability. Here, an in situ forming depot-injectable polymeric system was used to deliver BiJ591, a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) targeting both prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and the CD3 T-cell receptor in prostate cancer. BiJ591 induced T-cell activation, prostate cancer-directed cell lysis, and tumor growth inhibition. The use of diblock (DB) and triblock (TB) biodegradable polyethylene glycol-poly(lactic acid; PEG-PLA) copolymers solubilized in tripropionin, a small-chain triglyceride, allowed maintenance of BiJ591 stability and functionality in the formed depot and controlled its release. In mice, after a single subcutaneous injection, one of the polymeric candidates, TB1/DB4, provided the most sustained release of BiJ591 for up to 21 days. Moreover, the use of BiJ591-TB1/DB4 formulation in prostate cancer xenograft models showed significant therapeutic activity in both low and high PSMA-expressing tumors, whereas daily intravenous administration of BiJ591 was less efficient.

What is less well understood is how germline variation contributes to disease aggressiveness in PC patients. To map germline modifiers of aggressive neuroendocrine PC, we generated a genetically diverse F2 intercross population using the transgenic TRAMP mouse model and the wild-derived WSB/EiJ (WSB) strain. The relevance of germline modifiers of aggressive PC identified in these mice was extensively correlated in human PC datasets and functionally validated in cell lines.  Results:   Aggressive PC traits were quantified in a population of 30 week old (TRAMP x WSB) F2 mice (n = 307). Correlation of germline genotype with aggressive disease phenotype revealed seven modifier loci that were significantly associated with aggressive disease. RNA-seq were analyzed using cis-eQTL and trait correlation analyses to identify candidate genes within each of these loci. Analysis of 92 (TRAMP x WSB) F2 prostates revealed 25 candidate genes that harbored both a significant cis-eQTL and mRNA expression correlations with an aggressive PC trait. We further delineated these candidate genes based on their clinical relevance, by interrogating human PC GWAS and PC tumor gene expression datasets. We identified four genes (CCDC115, DNAJC10, RNF149, and STYXL1), which encompassed all of the following characteristics: 1) one or more germline variants associated with aggressive PC traits; 2) differential mRNA levels associated with aggressive PC traits; and 3) differential mRNA expression between normal and tumor tissue. Functional validation studies of these four genes using the human LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cell line revealed ectopic overexpression of CCDC115 can significantly impede cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, CCDC115 human prostate tumor expression was associated with better survival outcomes.  Conclusion:   We have demonstrated how modifier locus mapping in mouse models of PC, coupled with in silico analyses of human PC datasets, can reveal novel germline modifier genes of aggressive PC. We have also characterized CCDC115 as being associated with less aggressive PC in humans, placing it as a potential prognostic marker of aggressive PC.""","""['Jean M Winter', 'Natasha L Curry', 'Derek M Gildea', 'Kendra A Williams', 'Minnkyong Lee', 'Ying Hu', 'Nigel P S Crawford']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['GNL3 and SKA3 are novel prostate cancer metastasis susceptibility genes.', 'A systems genetics approach identifies CXCL14, ITGAX, and LPCAT2 as novel aggressive prostate cancer susceptibility genes.', 'Germline genetic variation modulates tumor progression and metastasis in a mouse model of neuroendocrine prostate carcinoma.', 'Prostate cancer genomics, biology, and risk assessment through genome-wide association studies.', 'The Collaborative Cross mouse model for dissecting genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases.', 'Identifying the role of transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and their potential therapeutic significances using genomic and transcriptome analyses.', 'Role of the Ubiquitin Ligase RNF149 in the Development of Rat Neonatal Gonocytes.', 'Pseudophosphatases as Regulators of MAPK Signaling.', 'The Roles of Pseudophosphatases in Disease.', 'Vacuolar Membrane ATPase Activity 21 Predicts a Favorable Outcome and Acts as a Suppressor in Colorectal Cancer.']"""

Accumulating evidence shows that heteronemin may act as a potent anticancer agent in clinical therapy. To fully understand the antitumor mechanism of heteronemin, we further explored the precise molecular targets in prostate cancer cells. Initially, heteronemin exhibited potent cytotoxic effect against LNcap and PC3 prostate cancer cells with IC50 1.4 and 2.7 &mu;M after 24 h, respectively. In the xenograft animal model, the tumor size was significantly suppressed to about 51.9% in the heteronemin-treated group in comparison with the control group with no significant difference in the mice body weights. In addition, the results of a cell-free system assay indicated that heteronemin could act as topoisomerase II (topo II) catalytic inhibitor through the elimination of essential enzymatic activity of topoisomerase II&alpha; expression. We found that the use of heteronemin-triggered apoptosis by 20.1⁻68.3%, caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by 66.9⁻99.1% and promoted calcium release by 1.8-, 2.0-, and 2.1-fold compared with the control group in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by annexin-V/PI, rhodamine 123 and Fluo-3 staining assays, respectively. Moreover, our findings indicated that the pretreatment of LNcap cells with an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPi) diminished growth inhibition, oxidative and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress, as well as activation of Chop/Hsp70 induced by heteronemin, suggesting PTP activation plays a crucial rule in the cytotoxic activity of heteronemin. Using molecular docking analysis, heteronemin exhibited more binding affinity to the N-terminal ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90 protein than 17-AAG, a standard Hsp90 inhibitor. Finally, heteronemin promoted autophagy and apoptosis through the inhibition of Hsp 90 and topo II as well as PTP activation in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, these multiple targets present heteronemin as an interesting candidate for its future development as an antiprostatic agent.""","""['Man-Gang Lee', 'Yi-Chang Liu', 'Yi-Lun Lee', 'Mohamed El-Shazly', 'Kuei-Hung Lai', 'Shou-Ping Shih', 'Seng-Chung Ke', 'Ming-Chang Hong', 'Ying-Chi Du', 'Juan-Cheng Yang', 'Ping-Jyun Sung', 'Zhi-Hong Wen', 'Mei-Chin Lu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mar Drugs""","""['Tackling the Cytotoxic Effect of a Marine Polycyclic Quinone-Type Metabolite: Halenaquinone Induces Molt 4 Cells Apoptosis via Oxidative Stress Combined with the Inhibition of HDAC and Topoisomerase Activities.', 'Breaking down Leukemia Walls: Heteronemin, a Sesterterpene Derivative, Induces Apoptosis in Leukemia Molt4 Cells through Oxidative Stress, Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Induction of Talin Expression.', 'Antileukemic Scalarane Sesterterpenoids and Meroditerpenoid from Carteriospongia (Phyllospongia) sp., Induce Apoptosis via Dual Inhibitory Effects on Topoisomerase II and Hsp90.', 'Dual Inhibitors of Human DNA Topoisomerase II and Other Cancer-Related Targets.', 'The power of heteronemin in cancers.', 'Oxidative-Stress-Mediated ER Stress Is Involved in Regulating Manoalide-Induced Antiproliferation in Oral Cancer Cells.', 'A Mini Review of Novel Topoisomerase II Inhibitors as Future Anticancer Agents.', 'Marine-Derived Compounds Targeting Topoisomerase II in Cancer Cells: A Review.', 'Antiproliferation Effects of Marine-Sponge-Derived Methanol Extract of Theonella swinhoei in Oral Cancer Cells In Vitro.', 'Bromoditerpenes from the Red Seaweed Sphaerococcus coronopifolius as Potential Cytotoxic Agents and Proteasome Inhibitors and Related Mechanisms of Action.']"""

Image-guided surgery using near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent contrast agents is a potential method to detect remaining cancerous tissue. The objective of this study was to evaluate three hyaluronic acid (HA) nanoparticle (NP) formulations loaded with NIR fluorophore for their ability to contrast-enhance prostate cancer. HA was modified by conjugation with the hydrophobic ligand, aminopropyl-1-pyrenebutanamide to drive nanoparticle self-assembly. Indocyanine green (ICG) was physicochemically entrapped in the HA-NP, termed NanoICG. Alternatively, Cy7.5 was directly conjugated to amphiphilic HA, termed NanoCy7.5. NanoCy7.5 was synthesized with two HA molecular weights to determine the HA size contribution to delivery to PC3 prostate tumor xenografts. Contrast-enhancement of the tumors and relative biodistribution were assessed by a series of fluorescence imaging, image-guided surgery with spectroscopy, and microscopic techniques. Intravenously administered NanoICG improved tumor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at 24 h over ICG by 2.9-fold. NanoCy7.5 with 10 kDa and 100 kDa HA improved tumor SNR by 6.6- and 3.1-fold over Cy7.5 alone, respectively. The PC3 xenograft was clearly identified with the image-guided system providing increased contrast enhancement compared to surrounding tissue for NanoICG and NanoCy7.5 with 10 kDa HA. NIR fluorescence microscopy showed that Cy7.5 in NPs with 10 kDa HA were distributed throughout the tumor, while NanoCy7.5 with 100 kDa HA or NanoICG delivered dye mainly to the edge of the tumor. CD31 staining suggested that PC3 tumors are poorly vascularized. These studies demonstrate the efficacy of a panel of HA-derived NPs in identifying prostate tumors in vivo, and suggest that by tuning the structural properties of these NPs, optimized delivery can be achieved to poorly vascularized tumors.  Statement of significance:   We have demonstrated the potential of a panel of near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) nanoparticles (NPs) for image-guided surgery in a prostate cancer xenograft model. Image-guided surgery and imaging of organs ex vivo showed greater tumor signal and contrast when mice were administered NIRF dyes that were covalently conjugated to (NanoCy7.510k-PBA) or physicochemically entrapped in (NanoICGPBA) hyaluronic acid (HA) NPs, compared to free dyes. These results show the potential to use these NPs as tools to detect the margins of tumors and to differentiate healthy and tumor tissue intraoperatively.

Phase I aimed to understand recruitment, and included: scrutinising recruitment data, interviewing the trial management group and recruiters (n = 13), and audio-recording recruitment consultations (n = 64). Data were analysed using qualitative content and thematic analysis methods. In Phase II, strategies to improve recruitment were developed and delivered.  Results:   Initially many recruiters found it difficult to maintain a position of equipoise and held preconceptions about which treatment was best for particular patients. They did not feel comfortable about approaching all eligible patients, and when the study was discussed, biases were conveyed through the use of terminology, poorly balanced information, and direct treatment recommendations. Individual and group feedback led to presentations to patients becoming clearer and enabled recruiters to reconsider their sense of equipoise. Although the precise impact of the QRI alone cannot be determined, recruitment increased (from a mean [range] of 1.4 [0-4] to 4.5 [0-12] patients/month) and the feasibility study reached its recruitment target.

In multivariable logistic regression models, more contemporary year of diagnosis was associated with higher LNI rate, when year of diagnosis was modeled as a continuous, categorized or cubic spline variable, with adjustment for either clinical (prostate specific antigen, clinical tumor stage, and biopsy Gleason group) or pathological characteristics (pathologic tumor stage and Gleason group), as well as PLND extent (number of removed lymph nodes).  Conclusion:   We confirmed the hypothesis about increasing LNI rate over time in RP patients. This observation implies an increasing rate of unfavorable PCa defined as LNI.

Patients and methods:   Using a prospective database of 3,029 men undergoing open radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon, we identified 2,909 men who received no neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and had at least 1 year of follow up. We retrospectively compared patients who received general analgesia with opioid analgesia (1999-2003, n = 662) to those who received general analgesia with multimodal analgesia incorporating paravertebral blocks (2003-2014, n = 2,247). The primary outcome was time to biochemical recurrence. Biochemical recurrence-free interval was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier technique and compared using a multivariate Cox-proportional hazards regression model.  Results:   In total, 395 patients (14%) experienced biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy, including 265 (12%) who received multimodal analgesia and 130 (20%) who did not (adjusted P = 0.27). After adjusting for age, race, body mass index, preoperative prostate specific antigen, grade, stage, perineural invasion, margin status, percent of tumor in the gland, and diameter of the dominant nodule, there was no difference in recurrence-free interval between groups (HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.73-1.17).

One of the most frequently altered growth factors in PCa is fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). It has previously been proposed that early stages of PCa are characterized by a primarily exogenous, that is, stromal cell-derived FGF-2 production, whereas advanced tumors rely more on an autocrine FGF-2 production. Prostate cancer progression is characterized by an increase of genomic instability including aneuploidy and structural chromosomal alterations. Herein, we address 2 problems that have not been comprehensively answered. First, we ask whether exogenous FGF-2 can directly drive genomic instability to promote PCa progression. Second, we investigate whether and to what extent stromal FGF-2 expression is maintained in advanced PCa and whether this influences tumor progression and patient prognosis.  Methods:   In vitro experiments to investigate the role of FGF-2 in numerical and structural chromosomal instability were performed using immunofluorescence microscopy, fluorescence in situ hybridization and single cell electrophoresis. A human patient-derived xenograft mouse model recapitulating osteoblastic PCa bone metastasis was used for in vivo validation experiments. The prognostic role of stromal FGF-2 expression was analyzed using immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray with primary tumor specimens from 162 predominantly high-risk patients with PCa.  Results:   Our results show that FGF-2 not only rapidly induces mitotic defects and numerical chromosomal imbalances but also an enhanced DNA breakage to promote chromosomal instability. Using the patient-derived xenograft model, we show that a deregulation of the FGF axis results in an increase of mitotic aberrations as well as DNA damage checkpoint activation in vivo. The FGFR inhibitor dovitinib was found to reduce numerical chromosomal instability as well as DNA breakage, thus underscoring the relevance of the FGF axis in promoting genomic instability. An overexpression of tumor cell-associated FGF-2 was detected in 52 of 162 patients (32.1%), whereas a stromal overexpression was found in 27 of 165 patients (16%). Remarkably, a strong stromal FGF-2 expression was associated with a significantly higher clinical stage and higher biochemical recurrence rate. Patients with strong stromal FGF-2 expression also had a significantly worse biochemical recurrence-free survival.  Conclusions:   Our results underscore that exogenous FGF-2 can shape PCa cell genomes and that stromal FGF-2 expression is detectable in a sizeable proportion of advanced PCa where it is associated with adverse clinico-pathological features. Our results highlight the impact of the tumor stroma on malignant progression and provide a rationale for a further exploration of components of the tumor stroma as therapeutic targets in PCa.""","""['Carine Pecqueux', 'Aysenur Arslan', 'Martina Heller', 'Michael Falkenstein', 'Adam Kaczorowski', 'Yanis Tolstov', 'Holger Sültmann', 'Carsten Grüllich', 'Esther Herpel', 'Anette Duensing', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Nora M Navone', 'Stefan Duensing']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['FGF2 causes genomic instability.', 'FGF-2 disrupts mitotic stability in prostate cancer through the intracellular trafficking protein CEP57.', 'Fibroblast growth factor-2 mediates transforming growth factor-beta action in prostate cancer reactive stroma.', 'A 3D in\xa0vitro model of patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft for controlled interrogation of in\xa0vivo tumor-stromal interactions.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'The role of fibroblast growth factors and their receptors in prostate cancer.', 'Role of Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor in Cancer: Biological Activity, Targeted Therapies, and Prognostic Value.', 'Systematic analysis of expression profiles and prognostic significance of the FGF gene family in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Comparative Pathobiology of Canine and Human Prostate Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions.', 'FGF/FGFR-Dependent Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Anti-Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'Fibroblast growth factors signaling in bone metastasis.']"""

The aim of our investigation was to demonstrate the effect of vitamin D3 consumption on the redox- and metal homeostasis in prostate cancer, because of the recommended daily dose increased from 200 IU to 2000 IU in recent years in Hungary. Forty-three volunteers were involved in the study. The grouping was applied according to the clinical routine laboratory parameters (vitamin D3) and the tumor markers (PSA, fPFA). Patients were divided into 5 groups: (A) patient control (N = 8), (B) patient control with vitamin D3 treatment (N = 9), (C) high-risk prostate cancer group (N = 6), (D) high-risk prostate cancer group with vitamin D3 treatment (N = 8) and (E) vitamin D3 treated cancerous group with androgen deprivation therapy (N = 11). The element concentrations were determined with ICP-OES. Among the redox parameters, free radical scavenging capacity and H-donating ability were determined with luminometry and spectrometry. Vitamin D3 treatment caused differences in the metal- and redox homeostasis in either patient control and cancerous groups. The concentration of Fe, Cr, and Pb significantly increased in the erythrocytes of prostate cancer patients. According to the higher scavenging capacity by vitamin D3 treatment, it seems that vitamin D3 helps to equilibrate the redox homeostasis that could affect the outcome of cancer positively. However, the tendency in the metal element status does not give a clear explanation of cancer's outcome, but the accumulation of Pb by vitamin D3 supplementation needs to be taken into more serious consideration in set terms of occupational diseases.""","""['Krisztina Süle', 'Klára Szentmihályi', 'Gergő Szabó', 'Dénes Kleiner', 'Imre Varga', 'Anna Egresi', 'Zoltán May', 'Péter Nyirády', 'Miklós Mohai Jr', 'Anna Blázovics']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Commentary on ""randomized clinical trial of vitamin D3 doses on prostatic vitamin D metabolite levels and Ki67 labeling in prostate cancer patients.""

The registration process in most targeted biopsy systems today relies heavily on accurate segmentation of ultrasound images. Automatic or semi-automatic segmentation is typically performed offline prior to the start of the biopsy procedure. In this paper, we present a deep neural network based real-time prostate segmentation technique during the biopsy procedure, hence paving the way for dynamic registration of mp-MRI and ultrasound data. In addition to using convolutional networks for extracting spatial features, the proposed approach employs recurrent networks to exploit the temporal information among a series of ultrasound images. One of the key contributions in the architecture is to use residual convolution in the recurrent networks to improve optimization. We also exploit recurrent connections within and across different layers of the deep networks to maximize the utilization of the temporal information. Furthermore, we perform dense and sparse sampling of the input ultrasound sequence to make the network robust to ultrasound artifacts. Our architecture is trained on 2,238 labeled transrectal ultrasound images, with an additional 637 and 1,017 unseen images used for validation and testing, respectively. We obtain a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 93%, a mean surface distance error of 1.10 mm and a mean Hausdorff distance error of 3.0 mm. A comparison of the reported results with those of a state-of-the-art technique indicates statistically significant improvement achieved by the proposed approach.""","""['Emran Mohammad Abu Anas', 'Parvin Mousavi', 'Purang Abolmaesumi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Deep Learning for Real-time, Automatic, and Scanner-adapted Prostate (Zone) Segmentation of Transrectal Ultrasound, for Example, Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Prostate Biopsy.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

We hypothesized that a number of these misses are due to the learning curve associated with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy. We report the results of repeat magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy in men with continued suspicion for cancer and the institutional learning curve in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer with time.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed the records of 1,813 prostate biopsies in a prospectively acquired cohort of men who presented for prostate biopsy in a 4-year period. All men were offered prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging and were assigned a maximum PI-RADS™ (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2) score. Biopsy outcomes in men with a suspicious region of interest were compared. The relationship between time and clinically significant prostate cancer detection was analyzed.  Results:   The clinically significant prostate cancer detection rate increased 26% with time in men with a PI-RADS 4/5 region of interest. On repeat magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy in men with continued suspicion for cancer 53% of those with a PI-RADS 4/5 region of interest demonstrated clinically significant discordance from the initial magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy compared to only 23% with a PI-RADS 1/2 region of interest. Significantly less clinically significant prostate cancer was missed or under graded in the most recent biopsies compared to the earliest biopsies.  Conclusions:   The high upgrade rate on repeat magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy and the increasing cancer detection rate with time show the significant learning curve associated with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy. Men with low risk or negative biopsies with a persistent, concerning region of interest should be promptly rebiopsied.

Cancer specific anxiety during active surveillance remains under studied. We evaluated long-term anxiety in men on active surveillance to determine whether interventions must be tailored to improve adherence.  Materials and methods:   A total of 413 men enrolled in active surveillance at a single tertiary care center completed quality of life surveys as part of routine care. A modified version of the MAX-PC (Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer) was used to determine cancer specific anxiety. Generalized estimating equations were applied to evaluate the association between anxiety and the duration on surveillance. Additionally, we examined associations between anxiety and patient age, marital status, Gleason score, the number of positive cores, family history and overall health.  Results:   Median patient age was 61 years, median prostate specific antigen at diagnosis was 4.4 ng/ml and 95% of the patients had Gleason 6 disease. Median time from the initiation of active surveillance to the last survey was 3.7 years. There was a 29% risk of reporting cancer specific anxiety within year 1. Anxiety significantly decreased with time (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.95, p = 0.003). Pathological and demographic characteristics were not associated with anxiety after adjusting for time on surveillance.

Methods:   Electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrance Library and Embase were searched for studies published from when the databases were established to January 1st, 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared docetaxel + prednisone (DP), cabazitaxel + prednisone (CP), docetaxel + estramustine + prednisone (DEP), and mitoxantrone + cabazitaxel + prednisone (MP) for CRPC treatment were identified. The network meta-analysis was conducted with software R 3.3.2. We analyzed the main outcomes, including the overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, tumor response and severe adverse events (AEs). Ranking of the chemotherapeutic agents was based on probabilities of interventions for each of the outcomes that were performed. The consistency of direct and indirect evidence was assessed by node splitting.  Results:   10 RCTs, with 3590 patients, were analyzed. The network meta-analysis results revealed that CP significantly increased OS, PFS, PSA response, tumor response, and severe AEs compared to MP. DP showed similar results with CP except for tumor response, where it showed slight inferiority in effectiveness. DEP was associated with clearly improved outcomes in PFS, PSA response and tumor response compared to those of MP, but this was not the case for OS benefit and severe AEs. No significant difference was detected in DP, CP and DEP except for the outcomes of severe AEs. MP was less effective in survival and clinical benefit, but much safer in safety outcomes than other chemotherapy agents. The probabilities of rank plots showed that CP ranked first in OS and tumor response; DEP ranked first in PFS time and PSA response; MP was the best treatment mode for safety.  Conclusions:   DP and CP survival benefit (OS, PFS) and clinical benefit (PSA response and tumor response) were comparable, as well as their associated AEs. DEP was associated with less survival benefit, similar clinical improvement and more AEs than DP or CP. MP had the lowest survival and clinical benefit but excellent safety than other agents. Based on evidences of current results, we recommended CP as the most suitable chemotherapy agent for CRPC patients, followed by DP, MP as third, and DEP as the last choice.

Previous studies have revealed that the FABP5 expression level is closely related to malignancy in various types of cancer.

Moreover, we demonstrated that FABP5 induced inflammation and cytokine production through the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway activated by reactive oxygen species and protein kinase C in PC-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, FABP5 might regulate lipid quality and/or quantity to promote aggressiveness such as cell growth, invasiveness, survival, and inflammation in prostate and breast cancer cells.

However, to our knowledge this has not been studied in earnest. Thus, we evaluated whether previous prostate biopsy related complications and the type of complication were associated with repeat prostate biopsy compliance in a clinical trial with study mandated systematic biopsies.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 4,939 men 50 to 75 years old who underwent 2-year prostate biopsy and were recommended to undergo 4-year prostate rebiopsy in the REDUCE (Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events) study. The analyzed biopsy complications were hematuria, urinary tract infection, acute urinary retention and hemospermia.  Results:   A total of 260 men (5.3%) had a 2-year prostate biopsy related complication, including hematuria in 180 (3.6%), urinary tract infection in 36 (0.7%), acute urinary retention in 26 (0.5%) and hemospermia in 102 (2.1%). A total of 474 men (9.6%) were noncompliant with 4-year rebiopsy. On univariable analysis any previous complication (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.08-2.24, p = 0.018), urinary tract infection (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.23-6.00, p = 0.013), acute urinary retention (OR 4.24, 95% CI 1.83-9.81, p = 0.016) and hemospermia (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.03-3.06, p = 0.037) were associated with rebiopsy noncompliance. Hematuria was not associated with rebiopsy noncompliance (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.74-1.91, p = 0.483). Results were unchanged on multivariable analysis, including for any complication (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018), for urinary tract infection (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.07-3.21, p = 0.029), for acute urinary retention (OR 4.51, 95% CI 1.93-10.54, p = 0.001), for hemospermia (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07-3.21, p = 0.029) and for hematuria (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.74-1.93, p = 0.472).

In this cohort, PAI-1 levels are higher in prostate cancer patients than healthy donors; uPA levels are higher in healthy donors than prostate cancer patients; and the uPA/PAI-1 ratio is higher in healthy donors than in prostate cancer patients.

The increase in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) signaling contributes to androgen receptor activity in a subset of patients with CRPC; however, enigmatically, HER2-targeted therapies have demonstrated a lack of efficacy in patients with CRPC. Aberrant glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer and involves key processes that support cancer progression. Using transcriptomic analysis of prostate cancer data sets, histopathologic examination of clinical specimens, and in vivo experiments of xenograft models, we reveal in this study a coordinated increase in glycan-binding protein, galectin-4, specific glycosyltransferases of core 1 synthase, glycoprotein- N-acetylgalactosamine 3-β-galactosyltransferase 1 (C1GALT1) and ST3 beta-galactoside α-2,3-sialyltransferase 1 (ST3GAL1), and resulting mucin-type O-glycans during the progression of CRPC. Furthermore, galectin-4 engaged with C1GALT1-dependent O-glycans to promote castration resistance and metastasis by activating receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and cancer cell stemness properties mediated by SRY-box 9 (SOX9). This galectin-glycan interaction up-regulated the MYC-dependent expression of C1GALT1 and ST3GAL1, which altered cellular mucin-type O-glycosylation to allow for galectin-4 binding. In clinical prostate cancer, high-level expression of C1GALT1 and galectin-4 together predict poor overall survival compared with low-level expression of C1GALT1 and galectin-4. In summary, MYC regulates abnormal O-glycosylation, thus priming cells for binding to galectin-4 and downstream signaling, which promotes castration resistance and metastasis.-Tzeng, S.-F., Tsai, C.-H., Chao, T.-K., Chou, Y.-C., Yang, Y.-C., Tsai, M.-H., Cha, T.-L., Hsiao, P.-W.

The structural and functional properties of AuNPs, AgNPs, and Ag@AuNPs were investigated in environments of increasing complexity, in water suspensions, in cells, and in tumors in vivo. While AgNPs showed the greatest heating efficiency in suspension (followed by Ag@AuNPs and AuNPs), this trend was reversed intracellularly within a tissue-mimetic model. In this setup, AgNPs failed to provide consistent photothermal conversion over time, due to structural damage induced by the intracellular environment. Remarkably, the degraded Ag was found to be stored within the iron-storage ferritin protein. By contrast, the Au shell provided the Ag@AuNPs with total Ag biopersistence.

This study assessed whether the level of engagement in ACOs by urologists affected rates of treatment, overtreatment, and spending.  Methods:   A 20% sample of national Medicare data was used to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2012 and 2014. The extent of urologist engagement in an ACO, as measured by the proportion of patients in an ACO managed by an ACO-participating urologist, served as the exposure. The use of treatment, potential overtreatment (ie, treatment in men with a ≥75% risk of 10-year noncancer mortality), and average payments in the year after diagnosis for each ACO were modeled.  Results:   Among 2822 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer, the median rates of treatment and potential overtreatment by an ACO were 71.3% (range, 23.6%-79.5%) and 53.6% (range, 12.4%-76.9%), respectively. Average Medicare payments among ACOs in the year after diagnosis ranged from $16,523.52 to $34,766.33. Stronger urologist-ACO engagement was not associated with treatment (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.2; P = .4) or spending (9.7% decrease in spending; P = .08). However, urologist engagement was associated with a lower likelihood of potential overtreatment (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.86; P = .03).  Conclusions:   ACOs vary widely in treatment, potential overtreatment, and spending for prostate cancer. ACOs with stronger urologist engagement are less likely to treat men with a high risk of noncancer mortality, and this suggests that organizations that better engage specialists may be able to improve the value of specialty care.

We further performed an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The patient cohort was grouped into three subpopulations, blinded to the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results, according to the patients' characteristics and different patterns of treatment: (1) S-RT (with or without systemic treatment), (2) stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) (with or without systemic treatment), and (3) systemic treatment. The treatment strategy was re-evaluated for each patient taking into consideration the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images.  Results:   We enrolled 119 PCa patients (mean age 66 years, range 44-78 years) with a mean PSA level at the time of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT of 0.34 ng/ml (median 0.32 ng/ml, SD ±0.09, range 0.20-0.50 ng/ml). 68Ga-PSMA-1 1 PET/CT was positive in 41 of the 119 patients, resulting in an overall detection rate of 34.4%. 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake was observed in the prostate bed (3 patients, 2.5%), in the pelvic lymph nodes (21, 17.6%), in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes (4, 3.4%) and in the skeleton (21, 17.6%). Regarding ITT, 81 patients (68.1%) were considered possible candidates for S-RT only in the prostate bed and none of the patients (0%) for SBRT. According to the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results, the intended treatment was changed in 36 patients (30.2%). According to the PET/CT results, S-RT was recommended in 70 patients (58.8%), only to the prostate bed in 58 (48.7%) and SBRT in 29 (24.4%). The intended RT planning was modified in 36 (87.8%) of 41 patients with a positive 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT result.  Conclusion:   In our patient series with PSA levels <0.5 ng/ml, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT had a detection rate of 34.4%. In the ITT analysis, 30.2% of patients had a change in the intended treatment. These data support the hypothesis that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is a useful procedure in the management of PCa patients showing early recurrence after RP, and should be implemented in routine clinical practice.""","""['Andrea Farolfi', 'Francesco Ceci', 'Paolo Castellucci', 'Tiziano Graziani', 'Giambattista Siepe', 'Alessandro Lambertini', 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Filippo Lodi', 'Alessio G Morganti', 'Stefano Fanti']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Mapping of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy in 270 Patients with a PSA Level of Less Than 1.0 ng/mL: Impact on Salvage Radiotherapy Planning.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in recurrent prostate cancer: efficacy in different clinical stages of PSA failure after radical therapy.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'PSMA-PET Guided Treatment in Prostate Cancer Patients with Oligorecurrent Progression after Previous Salvage Treatment.', 'Detection Efficacy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer with Very Low PSA Levels: A 7-Year, Two-Center ""Real-World"" Experience.', 'The Prognostic Value of DCE-MRI Findings before Salvage Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression on PET/CT in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Observational Study.', 'The Impact of PSMA-PET on Oncologic Control in Prostate Cancer Patients Who Experienced PSA Persistence or Recurrence.']"""

Eleven prostate IMRT cases were selected, and errors in multileaf collimator (MLC) bank sag, MLC leaf traveling, and machine output were simulated by recalculating the dose distributions in patients. 2D doses were extracted from the 3D doses at the isocenter position. The 3D and 2D %GPs with different gamma criteria were then obtained by comparing the recalculated and original doses in specific regions of interest (ROI), such as the whole body, the planning target volume (PTV), the bladder, and the rectum. The sensitivities to simulated errors of the two types of %GP were compared, and the correlation between the 2D and 3D %GPs for different ROIs were analyzed. For the whole-body evaluation, both the 2D and 3D %GPs with the 3%/3 mm criterion were above 90% for all tested MLC errors and for MU deviations up to 4%, and the 3D %GP was higher than the 2D %GP. In organ-specific evaluations, the PTV-specific 2D and 3D %GP gradients were -4.70% and -5.14% per millimeter of the MLC traveling error, and -17.79% and -20.50% per percentage of MU error, respectively. However, a stricter criterion (2%/1 mm) was needed to detect the tested MLC sag error. The Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant strong correlation (r > 0.8 and P < 0.001) between the 2D and 3D %GPs in the whole body and PTV-specific gamma evaluations. The whole-body %GP with the 3%/3 mm criterion was inadequate to detect the tested MLC and MU errors, and a stricter criterion may be needed.

The dogma that urine in healthy individuals must be sterile has been overturned. Dysbiosis of the urinary microbiome has been revealed responsible for various urological disorders, including prostate cancer. The link between chronic inflammation, microbiome and solid tumors has been established for various neoplastic diseases. However, a detailed and comprehensive analysis of urinary microenvironment of bladder cancer has not been yet reported. We performed this study to characterize the potential urinary microbial community possibly associated with bladder cancer. Mid-stream urine was collected from 31 male patients with bladder cancer and 18 non-neoplastic controls. DNA was extracted from urine pellet samples and processed for high throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V4 region using Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing reads were filtered using QIIME and clustered using UPARSE. We observed increased bacterial richness (Observed Species, Chao 1 and Ace indexes; cancer vs. control; 120.0 vs. 56.0; 134.5 vs. 68.3; and 139.6 vs. 72.9, respectively), enrichment of some bacterial genera (e.g., Acinetobacter, Anaerococcus, and Sphingobacterium) and decrease of some bacterial genera (e.g., Serratia, Proteus, and Roseomonas) in cancer group when compared to non-cancer group. Significant difference in beta diversity was found between cancer and non-cancer group, among different risk level, but not among different tumor grade. Enrichment of Herbaspirillum, Porphyrobacter, and Bacteroides was observed in cancer patients with high risk of recurrence and progression, which means these genera maybe potential biomarkers for risk stratification. The PICRUSt showed that various functional pathways were enriched in cancer group, including Staphylococcus aureus infection, glycerolipid metabolism and retinol metabolism. To our knowledge, we performed the most comprehensive study to date to characterize the urinary microbiome associated with bladder cancer.

Furthermore, we aim to find more novel and effective PCa molecular markers to provide an early screening of PCa, distinguish patients with aggressive PCa, predict the prognosis, or reduce the economic burden of PCa.  Methods:   SERPING1 protein expression in both human PCa and normal prostate tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining, which intensity was analyzed in association with clinical pathological parameters such Gleason score, pathological grade, clinical stage, tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. Moreover, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database, Taylor Database, and Oncomine dataset to validate our immunohistochemical results and investigated the value of SERPING1 in PCa at mRNA level. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the relationship between SERPING1 and prognosis of patients with PCa.  Results:   The outcome showed that SERPING1 was expressed mainly in cytoplasm of grand cells of prostate tissue and was significantly expressed less in PCa (P<0.001). Furthermore, in the tissue microarray of our samples, decreasing expression of SERPING1 was correlated with the higher Gleason score (P = 0.004), the higher pathological grade (P = 0.01) and the advanced tumor stage (P = 0.005) at protein level. In TCGA dataset and Taylor Dataset, low-expressed SERPING1 was correlated with the younger patient (P = 0.02 in TCGA, P = 0.044 in Taylor) and the higher Gleason score (P = 0.019 in TCGA, P<0.001 in Taylor) at mRNA level. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the lower mRNA of SERPING1 predicted lower overall survivals (P = 0.027 in TCGA), lower disease-free survival (P = 0.029) and lower biochemical recurrence-free survival (P = 0.011 in Taylor). Data from Oncomine database shown that SERPING1 low expression implying higher malignancy of prostate lesions. Using multivariate analysis, we also found that SERPING1 expression was independent prognostic marker of poor disease-free survival and biochemical recurrence-free survival.

However, there are many different approaches for AIF assessment so that the absolute values of perfusion parameters may vary depending on the used method. This study analyzes the influence of the method of AIF determination on quantitative DCE-MRI.  Methods:   In this retrospective, single-center, cohort study three different methods of AIF determination in 50 consecutive patients with multiparametric MRI of the prostate were conducted. As a reference, AIF was selected manually by defining a region of interest in an artery manually (AIFm). The second method (AIFa), based on an automated algorithm and the third, population-derived AIFp where then compared. Primary endpoint were differences in the performance of the perfusion parameters Ktrans, ve and kep regarding the AIF acquisition methods, secondary endpoints consisted of the evaluation of differences in the peripheral and transition zone of the prostate (PZ, TZ).  Results:   In all three methods, Ktrans, ve, and kep were significantly higher in PZ than in TZ with Ktrans showing least overlapping. There were no significant differences for Ktrans determined with AIFm and AIFa (0.3 ± 0.2 min-1 for PZ for both and 0.5 ± 0.3 min-1 for TZ in AIFm and 0.4 ± 0.3 min-1 in AIFa), while there were great differences between AIFa and AIFp and AIFm and AIFp (0.1 ± 0.03 min-1 for TZ and PZ in AIFp). Spearman test demonstrated good correlation of values for Ktrans and kep in all 3 methods (ρ ≥ 0.76). AIFa showed a success rate of 98% in finding the artery.  Conclusion:   AIFa is a recommendable user-independent automatical method to determine quantitative perfusion parameters allowing an objective measurement and saving interactive time for the radiologist.

This is the first series of cases on this entity. We describe the histologic, immunohistochemical, and clinical findings of 4 patients with Skene's gland adenocarcinoma retrieved from the Johns Hopkins Urologic Pathology Consult Service from 1984 to 2017. The average age at diagnosis of the 4 women was 74.5 years (range, 61 to 87 y). Tumors were treated by limited resections with negative margins. Tumor size ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 cm (mean, 1.5 cm). Average follow-up time was 40.7 months (range, 4 to 132 mo). Three of our cases were morphologically consistent with prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma with variable cribriform, fused, and poorly formed glands, analogous to Gleason score 4+4=8. Of these, one had mixed ductal features with neoplastic cells showing papillary carcinoma with columnar cytology. These 3 lesions were positive for PSA, P501S, NKX3.1, and AMACR. Focal goblet cells positive for CK20 and negative for prostatic markers were seen in one of these cases, suggesting intestinal differentiation (although negative for CDX2 and SATB2). A fourth case had glandular and papillary formations with pseudostratified columnar epithelium and mucin secretion, showing positivity for CK7, ER, and P16, and negativity for prostatic markers, suggesting serous differentiation (although negative for PAX8 and WT1). PIN4 cocktail confirmed the origin in preexisting paraurethral glands in 3 of the cases. All patients were alive and free of recurrence or metastatic disease at the time of last follow-up. Because of the rarity of Skene's gland adenocarcinomas, there is no consensus regarding their treatment. Our findings demonstrate that Skene's gland adenocarcinomas recapitulate morphologies and immunohistochemical markers seen in prostatic adenocarcinoma. However, it is unknown whether applying the same grading criteria for prostatic adenocarcinomas to Skene's gland adenocarcinoma is valid given the small number of cases with variable treatment and limited follow-up.""","""['Aline C Tregnago', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""[""Skene's gland adenocarcinoma with intestinal differentiation: A case report and literature review."", ""First Molecular Genetic Characterization of Skene's Gland Adenocarcinoma."", ""Skene's gland adenocarcinoma with increased serum level of prostate-specific antigen."", ""Prostate specific antigen and prostate specific acid phosphatase in adenocarcinoma of Skene's paraurethral glands and ducts."", ""Skene's Gland Malignancy: A Case Report and Systematic Review."", 'CDX2- and PAX8-Expressing Subtypes in Female Urethral Adenocarcinoma: Pathogenesis Insights through Immunohistochemical and Morphological Analyses.', 'Large Cyst of Skene Gland: A Rare Perineum Mass.', 'New WHO classification 2022: urinary bladder cancer.', 'A PAX-8-Positive Female Urethral Adenocarcinoma, Intestinal-Type: A Case Report with Diagnostic Challenges and a Review of the Literature.', 'Management of Primary Female Urethral Adenocarcinoma: Two Rare Case Reports and Literature Review.']"""

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study comprised 231 patients with localized prostate cancer, who underwent surgery between February 2015 and February 2016. Surgery was performed using one of three approaches: laparoscopic, extraperitoneoscopic or robot-assisted. Nerve-sparing surgery was chosen were based on the Briganti nomogram (low risk of extraprostatic extension), Partins table, and taking into account the patients desire to maintain EF. EF and the quality of life were evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire and the QoL (Quality of Life) scale.  Results:   Nerve-sparing RP was performed in 153 patients. Nerve-sparing RP did not differ significantly from non-nerve sparing RP with regard to operative time (p=0.064) and blood loss (p=0.073). According to the pathomorphological study, the prostatic capsule was intact, and surgical margins were negative in all cases. The incidence of significant ED and complete loss of erectile function was greater in patients after non-nerve sparing RP compared with nerve sparing RP [(5.0 (0-10.0) vs. 6.5 (0.8-19,0) points according to the IIEF-5 scale, p=0.271)]; 96.2% versus 72.2% (p<0.001). Nerve-sparing RP had a statistically significant better effect on the quality of life: 1.63+/-1.16 points against 1.88+/-1.02 points (p=0.035).  Conclusion:   The best outcomes were observed in patients undergoing robot-assisted RP. Nerve-sparing RP resulted in a lower rate of ED.

A prostate cancer mouse model was generated by treating C57/BL‑6 and B6.Cg‑Selplgtm1Fur/J mice with 3,2'‑dimethyl 4‑aminobiphenyl (DMAB). Hematoxylin and eosin staining detected the histopathological alterations of mouse prostate tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining determined cell proliferation of the mice. Flow cytometry was used to detect the alterations of T cells in C57+DMAB or CXCL9+DMAB mice. Immunofluorescence revealed that there was positive expression of interleukin‑6 (IL‑6) and transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β in the mouse tissues. The survival rates of C57+DMAB and CXCL9+DMAB mice was analyzed. The association of CXCL9 expression and clinical stages was also evaluated. Results revealed that prostate cancer pathology and cell proliferation in CXCL9+DMAB mice were significantly greater compared with the C57+DMAB mice. Compared with C57+DMAB mice, the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly reduced. IHC demonstrated that the expression of IL‑6 and TGF‑β was significantly downregulated in the CXCL9+DMAB mice. The survival rate of CXCL9+DMAB mice was significantly decreased compared with the C57+DMAB mice. In addition, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that CXCL9 mRNA expression in clinical samples was positively associated with clinical pathological stages of prostate cancer.

The present study was designed to investigate the synergistic effect of genistein and AG1024 on the radiosensitivity of PCa cells. The optimal X‑irradiation dose (4 Gy) and genistein concentration (30 µM) were selected by using the CCK‑8 assay. Before X‑irradiation (4 Gy), PC3 and DU145 cells were treated with genistein (30 µM), AG1024 (10 µM) and their combination. All treatments significantly reduced cell proliferation and enhanced cell apoptosis. Using flow cytometric analysis, we found that genistein arrested the cell cycle at S phase and AG1024 arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase. Genistein treatment suppressed the homologous recombination (HRR) and the non‑homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways by inhibiting the expression of Rad51 and Ku70, and AG1024 treatment only inhibited the NHEJ pathway via the inactivation of Ku70 as detected by western blot analysis.

The miR‑210 expression levels in patients and healthy men was quantified. Primary prostate cancer cells were placed in three treatment groups: i) NC group, untreated; ii) BL group, empty vector; and iii) anti‑miR‑210 group, miR‑210 inhibitor‑transfected. Cell proliferation and apoptotic rate were detected by MTT and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression levels of miR‑210 and regulator of differentiation 1 (ROD1) were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and the ROD1 protein expression in each group was detected by western blotting. Cell proliferation rate of the anti‑miR‑210 group was significantly reduced when compared with the NC and BL groups (P≤0.05); however, the apoptotic rate of the anti‑miR‑210 group was significantly increased compared with the NC and BL groups (P≤0.05). RT‑qPCR revealed that the expression level of miR‑210 and ROD1 in the anti‑miR‑210 group was significantly reduced when compared with the NC and BL groups (P<0.05).

To date, no specific medical treatment exists to specifically target biofilms in the human host. Similarly, the identification of a biofilm has relied upon the analysis of tissue samples with electron microscopy or DNA identification with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Standard culture and sensitivity test is not able to detect a presence of biofilms.  Materials and methods:   Two types of molecular microbial diagnostic testing 'levels' are performed as noted below. In both types of analysis, the microbial DNA is extracted from the patient's sample. The patient report contains information about the pathogenic bacterial and fungal microorganisms detected, bacterial load and resistance genes to different antibiotics. Once the bacteria have been identified antibiotic recommendations are made based on research confirming the effectiveness of treatment. The technique was tested in 112 patients in different areas of urology for prevention and treatment purpose.  Results:   The clinical application of next generation sequence in different clinical phase I-II trials (acute cystitis in 56 patients, rectal swabs before transrectal prostate biopsy in 32 men, neurogenic bladder in 13 patients, chronic bacterial prostatitis in 17 men) demonstrated that this novel approach extends our knowledge about the microbiome of the urogenital tract in both men and women. DNA sequence has a high sensitivity to detect a bacterial and fungal association with resistant genes to antibiotics revealed allowing to implement a targeted and individual prevention and treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) with improved efficacy compared to standard culture and sensitivity technique.

Materials and methods:   Between 2008-2012, 584 consecutive men with intermediate or high risk clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate underwent robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with concomitant LLND (n = 326) or ELND (n = 258). Survival estimates were made using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank statistic was used for comparison of curves. BCR predictors were determined with multivariable Cox regression analysis. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare discrete and continuous variables, respectively, across the two groups.  Results:   Median follow up for ELND and LLND patients was 46 and 54 months, respectively. ELND yielded more LNs (20 versus 6, p < 0.0001) and had higher node positivity (15.1% versus 3.4%, p < 0.0001).

SNPH ubiquitination did not result in protein degradation, but instead anchored SNPH on tubulin to inhibit mitochondrial motility and cycles of organelle fusion and fission, that is dynamics. Expression of ubiquitination-defective SNPH mutant Lys111→Arg or Lys153→Arg increased the speed and distance traveled by mitochondria, repositioned mitochondria to the cortical cytoskeleton, and supported heightened tumor chemotaxis, invasion, and metastasis in vivo Interference with SNPH ubiquitination activated mitochondrial dynamics, resulting in increased recruitment of the fission regulator dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) to mitochondria and Drp1-dependent tumor cell motility. These data uncover nondegradative ubiquitination of SNPH as a key regulator of mitochondrial trafficking and tumor cell motility and invasion. In this way, SNPH may function as a unique, ubiquitination-regulated suppressor of metastasis.Significance: These findings reveal a new mechanism of metastasis suppression by establishing the role of SNPH ubiquitination in inhibiting mitochondrial dynamics, chemotaxis, and metastasis.

Research design and methods:   LEADER (NCT01179048) was an international, phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Participants aged ≥50 years with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk were assigned 1:1 to receive liraglutide (≤1.8 mg daily; n = 4,668) or placebo (n = 4,672) in addition to standard care and monitored for 3.5-5 years (median follow-up 3.8 years). The occurrence of neoplasms was a prespecified, exploratory secondary end point. Post hoc analyses of the time to the first confirmed neoplasms were conducted using a Cox regression model.  Results:   Neoplasm was confirmed in 10.1% of patients with liraglutide versus 9.0% with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12 [95% CI 0.99; 1.28]). The HR (95% CI) for liraglutide versus placebo was 1.06 (0.90; 1.25) for malignant neoplasms and 1.16 (0.93; 1.44) for benign neoplasms. Sensitivity analyses excluding neoplasms occurring <1 year or <2 years after randomization and analyses by sex provided similar results. In our main analyses, the 95% CI for the HR included one for all malignant neoplasms evaluated (including pancreatic and thyroid neoplasms) except for prostate neoplasms, which occurred in fewer liraglutide-treated patients.  Conclusions:   LEADER was not primarily designed to assess neoplasm risk.

Quality of life is evaluated at the time cancer was diagnosed and at subsequent assessments via the Italian version of the University of California Los Angeles-Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12).  Results:   At diagnosis, lower scores on the physical component of the SF-12 were associated to older ages, obesity and the presence of 3+ moderate/severe comorbidities. Lower scores on the mental component were associated to younger ages, the presence of 3+ moderate/severe comorbidities and a T-score higher than one. Urinary and bowel functions according to UCLA-PCI were generally good. Almost 5% of the sample reported using at least one safety pad daily to control urinary loss; less than 3% reported moderate/severe problems attributable to bowel functions, and sexual function was a moderate/severe problem for 26.7%. Diabetes, 3+ moderate/severe comorbidities, T2 or T3-T4 categories and a Gleason score of eight or more were significantly associated with lower sexual function scores at diagnosis.

Current treatments offered in the clinics are often toxic and have severe side effects. Hence, to treat and manage PCa, new agents with fewer side effects or having potential to reduce side effects of conventional therapy are needed. In this study, we show anti-cancer effects of quercetin, an abundant bioflavonoid commonly used to treat prostatitis, and defined quercetin-induced cellular and molecular changes leading to PCa cell death.  Methods:   Cell viability was assessed using MTT. Cell death mode, mitochondrial outer membrane potential, and oxidative stress levels were determined by flow cytometry using Annexin V-7 AAD dual staining kit, JC-1 dye, and ROS detection kit, respectively. Antibody microarray and western blot were used to delineate the molecular changes induced by quercetin.  Results:   PCa cells treated with various concentrations of quercetin showed time- and dose-dependent decrease in cell viability compared to controls, without affecting normal prostate epithelial cells. Quercetin led to apoptotic and necrotic cell death in PCa cells by affecting the mitochondrial integrity and disturbing the ROS homeostasis depending upon the genetic makeup and oxidative status of the cells. LNCaP and PC-3 cells that have an oxidative cellular environment showed ROS quenching after quercetin treatment while DU-145 showed rise in ROS levels despite having a highly reductive environment. Opposing effects of quercetin were also observed on the pro-survival pathways of PCa cells. PCa cells with mutated p53 (DU-145) and increased ROS showed significant reduction in the activation of pro-survival Akt pathway while Raf/MEK were activated in response to quercetin. PC-3 cells lacking p53 and PTEN with reduced ROS levels showed significant activation of Akt and NF-κB pathway. Although some of these changes are commonly associated with oncogenic response, the cumulative effect of these alterations is PCa cell death.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrated quercetin exerts its anti-cancer effects by modulating ROS, Akt, and NF-κB pathways. Quercetin could be used as a chemopreventive option as well as in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs to improve clinical outcomes of PCa patients.""","""['Ashley B Ward', 'Hina Mir', 'Neeraj Kapur', 'Dominique N Gales', 'Patrick P Carriere', 'Shailesh Singh']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""World J Surg Oncol""","""['The roles of endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway in quercetin-mediated cell death of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'KNK437, a benzylidene lactam compound, sensitises prostate cancer cells to the apoptotic effect of hyperthermia.', 'Increased Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species Mediates the Anti-Cancer Effects of WZ35 via Activating Mitochondrial Apoptosis Pathway in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Molecular pathways mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of calcitriol: implications for prostate cancer chemoprevention and treatment.', 'Quercetin for the treatment of prostate cancer: Progress in studies.', 'Nosip is a potential therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Potentiation of Cisplatin Cytotoxicity in Resistant Ovarian Cancer SKOV3/Cisplatin Cells by Quercetin Pre-Treatment.', 'Network pharmacology prediction and molecular docking-based strategy to discover the potential pharmacological mechanism of Huang-Qi-Gui-Zhi-Wu-Wu decoction against deep vein thrombosis.', 'Quercetin can be a more reliable treatment for metastatic prostate cancer than the localized disease: An in vitro study.', 'Research progress on the utilization technology of broccoli stalk, leaf resources, and the mechanism of action of its bioactive substances.']"""

The molecular mass of Cv-LAAO is 120 kDa in its native form and 60 kDa in its monomeric form. The optimum enzyme activity was achieved on l-Leucine as a substrate in 50 mM buffer pH 7.5 at 50 °C. The Cv-LAAOI activity was significantly reduced by increasing the temperature over 40 °C, lost 75% of its activity at 60 °C and inhibited completely at 80 °C. The Cv-LAAOI attains the highest substrate specificity towards L-Met. The results have also indicated that Mn2+ enhances the enzyme activity by 10%, while Cu2+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Co2+ have suppressive effects on the Cv-LAAOI activity. On the other hand, EDTA has no significant effect on the enzyme activity. The kinetic parameters of Cv-LAAOI activity (Km, Kcat and Vmax) estimated on l-Leucine at pH 8 and 37 °C were found to be 2 mM, 12 S-1 and 16.7 μmol/min/ml, respectively. In addition, the results have shown that Cv-LAAOI exhibits a significant bactericidal activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with MIC values of 20 μg/ml. Moreover, Cv-LAAOI has exhibited a considerable cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) with IC50 value 2.75 ± 0.38 μg/ml compared with different tumor cell lines (liver HepG2, lung A549, colon HCT116 and prostate PC3). Furthermore, Cv-LAAOI has triggered antiproliferative activity via extensive H2O2 generation as indicated by the increase in H2O2 and TBARS levels accompanied by the depletion in the catalase activity (CAT) in MCF-7 treated cells compared to the untreated ones. Thus, these findings clearly indicate that Cv-LAAOI has a selective cytotoxic effect on breast cancer cell line, demonstrating a great prospective for future use in cancer therapy.""","""['Walaa H Salama', 'Nihal M Ibrahim', 'Amr E El Hakim', 'Roqaya I Bassuiny', 'Manal M Mohamed', 'Fatma M Mousa', 'Mamdouh M Ali']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Toxicon""","""['Heterodimeric l-amino acid oxidase enzymes from Egyptian Cerastes cerastes venom: Purification, biochemical characterization and partial amino acid sequencing.', 'Purification, characterization and antibacterial activity of L-amino acid oxidase from Cerastes cerastes.', 'A thermoactive L-amino acid oxidase from Cerastes cerastes snake venom: purification, biochemical and molecular characterization.', 'Thrombin-like serine proteases in Cerasted venoms (Cerasted cerastes and Cerastes vipera).', 'L-amino acid oxidase from snake venom and its anticancer potential.', 'Action mechanism of snake venom l-amino acid oxidase and its double-edged sword effect on cancer treatment: Role of pannexin 1-mediated interleukin-6 expression.', 'Purification of PaTx-II from the Venom of the Australian King Brown Snake and Characterization of Its Antimicrobial and Wound Healing Activities.', 'An Emergent Role for Mitochondrial Bioenergetics in the Action of Snake Venom Toxins on Cancer Cells.', 'Egyptian cobra (Naja haje haje) venom phospholipase A2: a promising antiviral agent with potent virucidal activity against simian rotavirus and bovine coronavirus.', 'Reptiles as Promising Sources of Medicinal Natural Products for Cancer Therapeutic Drugs.']"""

We aimed to identify whether prostate cancer survivors resident in New South Wales Australia are at higher risk of suicide and if so, who is most at risk.  Methods:   Data were obtained from the New South Wales (NSW) Cancer Registry for all men diagnosed with prostate cancer in NSW during 1997 to 2007. These were linked by the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) to Australian Bureau of Statistics Mortality Data to the end of 2007 to determine vital status and cause of death. We compared the number of suicides observed for prostate cancer survivors with the expected number of suicides based on age- and calendar year- specific rates for the NSW male population using standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). Suicide rate ratios (RR) by disease and patients' characteristics were estimated using multivariable negative binomial regression to determine the most at risk groups.  Results:   During the study period 51,924 NSW men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Forty nine of these men were subsequently recorded as committing suicide up to 10 years after diagnosis with an SMR of 1.70 (95% CI:1.26-2.25). Twenty six (53%) of these suicides occurred within 12 months after diagnosis. Risk diminished over time since diagnosis (RR in 1-2 years after diagnosis = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12-0.71, 2-4 years RR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.14-0.16 and 4+ years RR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.11-0.60 compared with <1 year since diagnosis). Men with non-localised disease had a higher risk of suicide compared to men with localised disease (RR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.15-6.23). Men living outside major cities had lower risk of suicide compared to those resident in major cities (rate ratio = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.20-0.87). Single, divorced, widowed or separated men were more likely to commit suicide than married men (RR = 4.18, 95% CI: 2.36-7.42).  Conclusion:   Risk of suicide is higher for NSW men diagnosed with prostate cancer than the general age matched male population. Vulnerable or lonely men and those with pre-existing depression or suicidal ideation who are diagnosed with prostate cancer should be offered additional psychological support.""","""['David P Smith', 'Ross Calopedos', 'Albert Bang', 'Xue Qin Yu', 'Sam Egger', 'Suzanne Chambers', ""Dianne L O'Connell""]""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Immediate risk of suicide and cardiovascular death after a prostate cancer diagnosis: cohort study in the United States.', 'Suicide risk in men with prostate-specific antigen-detected early prostate cancer: a nationwide population-based cohort study from PCBaSe Sweden.', 'Patterns of surgical care for prostate cancer in NSW, 1993-2002: rural/urban and socio-economic variation.', 'Decreasing suicide risk among patients with prostate cancer: Implications for depression, erectile dysfunction, and suicidal ideation screening.', 'Lung cancer patients have the highest malignancy-associated suicide rate in USA: a population-based analysis.', 'Suicide risk and mortality among patients with cancer.', 'Analysis of Factors Associated with the Risk of Suicide in a Brazilian Capital: Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Depression and prostate cancer: implications for urologists and oncologists.', 'Quality of life, depression, and psychosocial mechanisms of suicide risk in prostate cancer.', ""Incidence and Risk Factors for Suicide Death among Kaposi's Sarcoma Patients: A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Analysis.""]"""

IFN-γ and TNF-α-treatment resulted in the induction of IDO and IL-6 gene expression and release in established cell lines, suggesting that the elicitation of PCa-TDSFs by these cytokines might contribute to progression of cancer into an untreatable phenotype. An analysis based on timing of biochemical recurrence revealed the prognostic value of IDO but not IL-6 gene expression in predicting recurrence-free survival in patients (RFS) with PCa.

We examined 2,651 CpGs from 80 TRGs and applied a combination of Cox and mixed models to identify CpGs prospectively associated with cancer (at FDR < 0.05). We also explored trajectories of DNA methylation, logistic regression stratified by time to diagnosis/censoring, and cross-sectional models of LTL at first blood draw. We identified 30 CpGs on 23 TRGs whose methylation was positively associated with cancer incidence (β = 1.0-6.93) and one protective CpG in MAD1L1 (β = -0.65), of which 87% were located in TRG promoters. Methylation trajectories of 21 CpGs increased in cancer cases relative to controls; at 4 to 8 years prediagnosis/censoring, 17 CpGs were positively associated with cancer. Three CpGs were cross-sectionally associated with LTL. TRG methylation may be a mechanism through which LTL dynamics reflect cancer risk.

In vitro, the analogues SK33 and SK51 showed very potent antiandrogenic activity, monitored using LNCaP/AR-Luciferase cells where growth, PSA and luciferase activity were used as AR activity measurements. These compounds were 10-fold more potent than bicalutamide and 100-fold more potent than enobosarm within the LNCaP model. These compounds were also active in LNCaP/BicR cells with acquired bicalutamide resistance. In vivo, using the AR-Luc reporter mice, these drugs showed potent AR inhibitory activity in the prostate and other AR-expressing tissues, e.g., testes, seminal vesicles, and brain. These compounds do not inhibit AR activity in the skeletal muscle, and spleen, thus indicating a selective tissue inhibitory profile. These compounds were also active in vivo in the Pb-Pten deletion model. SK33 and SK51 have significantly different and enhanced activity profiles compared with enobosarm and are ideal candidates for further development for prostate cancer therapy with potentially fewer side effects.

Radix et Rhizoma Rhei had been applied to treat PCa long-termly and effectively when combined with surgical treatment and chemotherapy. However, its active components and target proteins are still not quite clear. As membrane receptors play a vital role in PCa, in this study, a novel strategy that combines comprehensive 2D 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-decorated prostate cancer cell (DU145) membrane chromatographic (CMC) system with network pharmacology approach was developed to characterize membrane binding active components proteins from Radix et Rhizoma Rhei and their targets. Thirteen active components were screened out by CMC system, among which emodin and rhapontigrnin with good membrane binding behaviors were validated to show ideal inhibitory effects on DU145 cells by cell viability and cell apoptosis assays. Five membrane proteins were predicted as the potential targets by the a specific network pharmacology approach, among which mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit (KIT) was identified as the most possible target by network data mining. Surface plasmon resonance analysis verified that the dissociation constant (KD) of rhapontigrnin and emodin with KIT was 6.06 × 10-5 M and 8.82 × 10-5 M, respectively. Our results showed that the combination of comprehensive 2D CMC system and network pharmacology based target identification could not only rapidly identify the membrane binding components but also find the potential membrane protein targets with high confidence, which could broaden the range of application scope of CMC, especially for the screening of active compounds from complex chemical samples using primary pathologic cell lines.""","""['Leyi Zheng', 'Si Chen', 'Yan Cao', 'Liang Zhao', 'Yue Gao', 'Xuan Ding', 'Xiaoyu Wang', 'Yanqiu Gu', 'Shaozhan Wang', 'Zhenyu Zhu', 'Yongfang Yuan', 'Xiaofei Chen', 'Yifeng Chai']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Chromatogr A""","""['Comprehensive two-dimensional APTES-decorated MCF7-cell membrane chromatographic system for characterizing potential anti-breast-cancer components from Yuanhu-Baizhi herbal medicine pair.', 'Exploration of the Two-Way Adjustment Mechanism of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma for Cardiovascular Diseases.', 'Development of APTES-Decorated HepG2 Cancer Stem Cell Membrane Chromatography for Screening Active Components from Salvia miltiorrhiza.', 'Research progress of effect of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma and its anthraquinone in treatment of autoimmune diseases.', 'Advance in studies on effect of Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma in relieving purgative activity of Rhei Radix et Rhizoma.', 'Significant Tumor Reduction With Traditional Chinese Medicine in a Patient With Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Case Report.', 'I n situ synthesis and unidirectional insertion of membrane proteins in liposome-immobilized silica stationary phase for rapid preparation of microaffinity chromatography.', 'Development of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTS)-modified bone marrow mononuclear cell membrane chromatography for screening anti-osteoporosis components from Scutellariae Radix.', 'Plants-Derived Biomolecules as Potent Antiviral Phytomedicines: New Insights on Ethnobotanical Evidences against Coronaviruses.', 'Dietary Compounds for Targeting Prostate Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included 184 patients who underwent prebiopsy bpMRI followed by transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy between June 2015 and February 2017. Reader 1 performed a combination of systematic and targeted biopsy with cognitive fusion after reviewing bpMRI and reader 2 reviewed the bpMRIs retrospectively. PI-RADS categories 4 and 5 were considered positive, and the results of the biopsy were considered the reference standard. Diagnostic performance of PI-RADS of bpMRI was evaluated in two PSA groups with a PSA cut-off level of 10 ng/ml and compared to PSA and the PSA density using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis.  Results:   csPCa was diagnosed in 24 of 123 patients (19.5%) and 26 of 61 patients (42.6%) in the low and high PSA groups, respectively. A PI-RADS v2 category by either readers 1 or 2 had a significantly better performance to detect csPCa than PSA in both PSA groups.

When a strong HPV-16 infection is found in the oral cavity, repeated exposure to the infected individual's coughing can infect others easily through saliva. Just like all of above cancer tissues, all 20 Alzheimer's cases that were examined had significantly increased HPV-16 of 1500-3000ng with markedly reduced Acetylcholine of 0.5~1.5ng and significantly increased 3- amyloid (1-42) of 7.5ng or higher. Since every cancer and Alzheimer's patient examined had significantly reduced amounts of Vitamin D3 and Taurine, the author examined the effects of Vitamin D3 and Taurine independently, or by combination. Each of optimal doses of Vitamin D3 and Taurine had significant beneficial effects that were anti-cancer, anti-cardiac ischemia, and memory loss & other brain problems, with significant excretion of HPV- 16 and bacteria such as Borrelia Burgdorferi, if it exists, through the urine, without using any anti-viral or anti-bacterial agents. However, when optimal doses of Taurine and Vitamin D3 were used together, 3 times/day, there was reduction of cancer-associated Oncogene CfosAB-2 or Integrin a5p1 with significantly high values of 200-500ng which were reduced to 0.001-0.004ng. Memory and brain function improved by increasing markedly reduced abnormal Acetylcholine of 1.5ng or less to a few hundred-2500ng with increase in DHEA. Abnormally increased P-amyloid (1-42) is markedly reduced. Ischemic heart, where there is abnormally increased Cardiac Troponin I, reduced significantly. In addition, abnormally reduced DHEA levels often increase. HPV- 16 in urine increased from an average of 100~15ng to an average of 4000ng and cancer related parameters in the urine significantly increased. Thus, the author found combined use of optimal dose of Vitamin D3 400 I.U. and optimal dose of Taurine 175mg, 3/day, was found to be one of the safest, most effective treatments for cancer, memory problems & other brain abnormality, and Ischemic heart problems, and this combination seems to improve any part of the body.

Our objective is to demonstrate that detectable changes in health-related quality of life measured by the bowel and urinary domains of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-50) were not substantially worse than baseline scores.  Methods and materials:   NRG Oncology's RTOG 0938 is a nonblinded randomized phase 2 study of National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-risk prostate cancer in which each arm is compared with a historical control. Patients were randomized to 5 fractions (7.25 Gy in 2 weeks) or 12 fractions (4.3 Gy in 2.5 weeks). The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a change in EPIC-50 bowel score at 1 year (baseline to 1 year) >5 points and in EPIC-50 urinary score >2 points tested with a 1-sample binomial test.  Results:   The study enrolled 127 patients to 5 fractions (121 analyzed) and 128 patients to 12 fractions (125 analyzed). Median follow-up for all patients at the time of analysis was 3.8 years. The 1-year frequency for >5 point change in bowel score were 29.8% (P < .001) and 28.4% (P < .001) for 5 and 12 fractions, respectively. The 1-year frequencies for >2 point change in urinary score were 45.7% (P < .001) and 42.2% (P < .001) for 5 and 12 fractions, respectively. For 5 fractions, 32.9% of patients had a drop in 1-year EPIC-50 sexual score of ≥11 points (P = .34); for 12 fractions, 30.9% of patients had a drop in 1-year EPIC-50 sexual score of ≥ 11 points (P = .20). Disease-free survival at 2 years is 99.2% (95% confidence interval: 97.5-100) in the 5-fraction arm and 97.5% (95% confidence interval: 94.6-100) in the 12-fraction arm. There was no late grade 4 or 5 treatment-related urinary or bowel toxicity.  Conclusions:   This study confirms that, based on changes in bowel and urinary domains and toxicity (acute and late), the 5- and 12-fraction regimens are well tolerated.

Insertion of an additional copy of this region sufficed to increase proliferation under low androgen conditions and to decrease sensitivity to enzalutamide. Epigenetic data generated in localized prostate tumors and benign specimens support the notion that this region is a developmental enhancer.

We report six patients receiving ICIs who presented with de novo myositis.  Methods:   We identified patients with myositis who were receiving ICIs between January 2004 and September 2016 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.  Results:   Six patients developed de novo myositis. The mean age was 64.3 years and five patients were male. Cancer types included melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer.

The median time to development of de novo myositis from first infusion was 5.4 weeks (range: 2.1-17.1 weeks). All patients with myositis had elevated levels of creatinine kinase, ranging from 514 to 13,710U/L. Two of them developed rhabdomyolysis, one with concurrent myocarditis. Five patients were treated with 1-2mg/kg corticosteroids, with variable response rates; one patient received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

One of these such technologies is auto-planning, which is an automated planning module within Pinnacle3. This study seeks to retrospectively evaluate the dosimetric quality of auto-planning-derived treatment plans as they compare to manual plans for intact prostate, prostate and lymph nodes, and brain treatment sites.  Materials and methods:   Previous clinical plans were used to generate site-specific auto-planning templates. These templates were used to compare the 3 evaluated treatment sites. Plans were replanned using auto-planning and compared to the clinically delivered plans. For the planning target volume, the following metrics were evaluated: homogeneity index, conformity index, D2cc, Dmean, D2%, D98%, and multiple dose fall-off parameters. For the organs at risk, D2cc, Dmean, and organ-specific clinical metrics were evaluated. Statistical differences were evaluated using a Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test with a significance level of 0.05. Statistically significant ( P < 0.05) differences were noted in organs at risk sparing.  Results:   For the prostate, there was as much as 6.8% reduction in bladder Dmean and 23.5% reduction in penile bulb Dmean. For the prostate + lymph nodes, decreases in Dmean values ranging from 4.1% in the small bowel to 22.3% in the right femoral head were observed. For brain, significant improvements were observed in Dmax and Dmean to most organs at risk.  Conclusion:   Our study showed improved organs at risk sparing in most organs while maintaining planning target volume coverage. Overall, auto-planning can generate plans that delivered the same target coverage as the clinical plans but offered significant reductions in mean dose to organs at risk.""","""['Kristen A McConnell', 'Tyler Marston', 'Brianna Elizabeth Zehren', 'Aziz Lirani', 'Dennis N Stanley', 'Aaron Bishop', 'Richard Crownover', 'Tony Eng', 'Zheng Shi', 'Ying Li', 'Diana Baacke', 'Neil Kirby', 'Karl Rasmussen', 'Niko Papanikolaou', 'Alonso N Gutierrez']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Dosimetric effect of photon beam energy on volumetric modulated arc therapy treatment plan quality due to body habitus in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Modeling the target dose fall-off in IMRT and VMAT planning techniques for cervical SBRT.', 'Fully automated, multi-criterial planning for Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy - An international multi-center validation for prostate cancer.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Rapid advances in auto-segmentation of organs at risk and target volumes in head and neck cancer.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiation Therapy.', 'A study on predicting cases that would benefit from proton beam therapy in primary liver tumors of less than or equal to 5\xa0cm based on the estimated incidence of hepatic toxicity.', 'Automatic Radiotherapy Planning for Glioblastoma Radiotherapy With Sparing of the Hippocampus and nTMS-Defined Motor Cortex.']"""

Men diagnosed with prostate cancer may experience chronic and debilitating treatment side effects, including sexual and urinary dysfunction, pain and fatigue. Side effects can be stressful and can also lead to poor psychosocial functioning. Prior trials reveal that group-based cognitive behavioral stress and self-management (CBSM) is effective in reducing stress and mitigating some of these symptoms, yet little is known about the effects of culturally-translated CBSM among Spanish-speaking men with PC. This manuscript describes the rationale and study design of a multi-site, randomized controlled trial to determine whether participation in a culturally adapted cognitive behavioral stress management (C-CBSM) intervention leads to significantly greater reductions in symptom burden and improvements in health-related quality of life relative to participation in a non-culturally adapted cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention. Participants (N = 260) will be Spanish-speaking Hispanic/Latino men randomized to the standard, non-culturally adapted CBSM intervention (e.g., cognitive behavioral strategies, stress management, and health maintenance) or the culturally adapted C-CBSM intervention (e.g., content adapted to be compatible with Hispanic/Latino cultural patterns and belief systems, meanings, values and social context) for 10 weeks. Primary outcomes (i.e., disease-specific symptom burden and health-related quality of life) will be assessed across time. We hypothesize that a culturally adapted C-CBSM intervention will be more efficacious in reducing symptom burden and improving health-related quality of life among Hispanic/Latino men when compared to a non-culturally adapted CBSM intervention.""","""['Frank J Penedo', 'Michael H Antoni', 'Patricia I Moreno', 'Lara Traeger', 'Dolores Perdomo', 'Jason Dahn', 'Gregory E Miller', 'Steve Cole', 'Julian Orjuela', 'Edgar Pizarro', 'Betina Yanez']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Contemp Clin Trials""","""['Cognitive behavioral stress management intervention improves quality of life in Spanish monolingual hispanic men treated for localized prostate cancer: results of a randomized controlled trial.', 'Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a technology-assisted psychosocial intervention for racially diverse men with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Identifying how and for whom cognitive-behavioral stress management improves emotional well-being among recent prostate cancer survivors.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'Interventions to Improve Quality of Life, Well-Being, and Care in Latino Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Literature Review.', 'Predictors of initial engagement with an asynchronous cognitive behavioral stress management website among older women with nonmetastatic breast cancer.', 'The impact of a stress management intervention including cultural components on stress biomarker levels and mental health indicators among indigenous women.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Experiences Among Hispanic/Latinx Patients: A Qualitative Analysis.', 'Stress Management Interventions to Facilitate Psychological and Physiological Adaptation and Optimal Health Outcomes in Cancer Patients and Survivors.', 'Analysis on the Correspondence between Sustainable Social Service Design and Humanistic Aesthetic Design and Cognitive Psychological Utility.']"""

Objective:   To study the prognostic value of lymphatic invasion (L1) and whether it might complement or even replace lymph node analysis in clinical practice.  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective analysis of pathological and clinical data from 14 528 consecutive patients.  Intervention:   Radical prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The impact of L1 and N1 on patient prognosis was measured with time to biochemical recurrence as the primary endpoint.  Results and limitations:   Nodal metastases were found in 1602 (12%) of 13 070 patients with lymph node dissection. L1 was seen in 2027 of 14 528 patients (14%) for whom lymphatic vessels had been visualized by immunohistochemistry. N1 and L1 continuously increased with unfavorable Gleason grade, advanced pT stage, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values (p<0.0001 each). N1 was found in 4.3% of 12 501 L0 and in 41% of 2027 L1 carcinomas (p<0.0001). L1 was seen in 11% of 9868 N0 and in 61% of 1360 N1 carcinomas (p<0.0001). Both N1 and L1 were linked to PSA recurrence (p<0.0001 each). This was also true for 17 patients with isolated tumor cells (ie, <200 unequivocal cancer cells without invasive growth) and 193 metastases ≤1mm. Combined analysis of N and L status showed that L1 had no prognostic effect in N1 patients but L1 was strikingly linked to PSA recurrence in N0 patients. N0L1 patients showed a similar outcome as N1 patients.  Conclusions:   Analysis of lymphatic invasion provides comparable prognostic information than lymph node analysis. Even minimal involvement of the lymphatic system has pivotal prognostic impact in prostate cancer. Thus, a thorough search for lymphatic involvement helps to identify more patients with an increased risk for disease recurrence.  Patient summary:   Already minimal amounts of tumor cells inside the lymph nodes or intraprostatic lymphatic vessels have a severe impact on patient prognosis.""","""['Waldemar Wilczak', 'Corinna Wittmer', 'Till Clauditz', 'Sarah Minner', 'Stefan Steurer', 'Franziska Büscheck', 'Till Krech', 'Maximilian Lennartz', 'Luisa Harms', 'Diane Leleu', 'Marc Ahrens', 'Sebastian Ingwerth', 'Christian T Günther', 'Christina Koop', 'Ronald Simon', 'Frank Jacobsen', 'Maria C Tsourlakis', 'Viktoria Chirico', 'Doris Höflmayer', 'Eik Vettorazzi', 'Alexander Haese', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Georg Salomon', 'Uwe Michl', 'Lars Budäus', 'Derya Tilki', 'Imke Thederan', 'Christoph Fraune', 'Cosima Göbel', 'Marie-Christine Henrich', 'Manuela Juhnke', 'Katharina Möller', 'Ahmed Abdullah Bawahab', 'Ria Uhlig', 'Meike Adam', 'Sören Weidemann', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen', 'Guido Sauter', 'Thorsten Schlomm']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Development and Internal Validation of a Novel Model to Identify the Candidates for Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pretreatment tables predicting pathologic stage of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Evolution in Prostate Cancer Staging: Pathology Updates From AJCC 8th Edition and Opportunities That Remain.', 'Application of machine learning algorithm in prediction of lymph node metastasis in patients with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Application of Indocyanine Green in Combination with Da Vinci Xi Robot in Surgeries on the Upper Urinary Tract: A Case Series Study.', 'Exosomal cargos-mediated metabolic reprogramming in tumor microenvironment.', 'Correlation analysis between immune-related genes and cell infiltration revealed prostate cancer immunotherapy biomarkers linked to T cells gamma delta.', 'Preoperative red cell distribution width is associated with postoperative lymphovascular invasion in prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy: A retrospective study.']"""

Objective:   To summarize the accuracy, strengths and weaknesses of PI-RADS v2, discuss pathway implications of its use and outline opportunities for improvements and future developments.  Evidence acquisition:   For this consensus expert opinion from the PI-RADS steering committee, clinical studies, systematic reviews, and professional guidelines for mpMRI PCa detection were evaluated. We focused on the performance characteristics of PI-RADS v2, comparing data to systems based on clinicoradiologic Likert scales and non-PI-RADS v2 imaging only. Evidence selections were based on high-quality, prospective, histologically verified data, with minimal patient selection and verifications biases.  Evidence synthesis:   It has been shown that the test performance of PI-RADS v2 in research and clinical practice retains higher accuracy over systematic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsies for PCa diagnosis. PI-RADS v2 fails to detect all cancers but does detect the majority of tumors capable of causing patient harm, which should not be missed. Test performance depends on the definition and prevalence of clinically significant disease. Good performance can be attained in practice when the quality of the diagnostic process can be assured, together with joint working of robustly trained radiologists and urologists, conducting biopsy procedures within multidisciplinary teams.  Conclusions:   It has been shown that the test performance of PI-RADS v2 in research and clinical practice is improved, retaining higher accuracy over systematic TRUS biopsies for PCa diagnosis.  Patient summary:   Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-directed biopsies using the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System improves the detection of prostate cancers likely to cause harm, and at the same time decreases the detection of disease that does not lead to harms if left untreated.

Methods and materials:   Thirty-nine patients underwent MRI prior to prostatectomy. After surgery, tissue was sliced according to MRI orientation using patient-specific 3-dimensionally printed slicing jigs. Whole-mount sections were annotated by our pathologist and digitally contoured to differentiate the lumen and epithelium. Slides were co-registered to the T2-weighted MRI scan. A learning curve was generated to determine the number of patients required for a stable machine-learning model. Patients were randomly stratified into 2 training sets and 1 test set. Two partial least-squares regression models were trained, each capable of predicting lumen and epithelium density. Predicted density values were calculated for each patient in the test dataset, mapped into the MRI space, and compared between regions confirmed as high-grade prostate cancer.  Results:   The learning-curve analysis showed that a stable fit was achieved with data from 10 patients. Maps indicated that regions of increased epithelium and decreased lumen density, generated from each independent model, corresponded with pathologist-annotated regions of high-grade cancer.

We analyzed data on 550 ER-positive breast cancer patients given hypofractionated whole-breast radiotherapy from June 2009 to September 2016. Baseline comorbidities considered in the hypertension-augmented Charlson Comorbidity Index (hCCI) were retrospectively retrieved. Total hCCI scores were classified as no comorbidity (hCCI = 0), low burden of comorbidity (hCCI = 1), and high burden of comorbidity (hCCI ≥ 2). Competing risk analysis was used to estimate the 5-year cumulative incidence of HT discontinuation. Fine and Gray models were used to estimate the adjusted subhazard ratio (SHR) of HT discontinuation by hCCI score. HT was initially prescribed for 85.6% of patients and almost all of them (468/471) took it for at least one month. It was subsequently discontinued by 45 patients (9.6%), for an overall 5-year cumulative incidence of 11.7%. The 5-year cumulative incidence of HT discontinuation rose from 3.9% in the youngest age group (65-69 years) to 23.3% in the oldest (≥ 80 years) (p = 0.005). Baseline comorbidity had some effect on the likelihood of discontinuing HT, but only among patients with a low burden of comorbidity (hCCI = 1, SHR 2.00, 95%CI 0.95-4.20). Adherence to HT was better in our sample than in the literature, probably because patients were selected and motivated to continue HT. This confirms the importance of communication with patients to improve adherence to HT.

In this study, we demonstrate that the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) agonist bromocriptine effectively enhances docetaxel efficacy and suppresses skeletal growth of prostate cancer in preclinical models. DRD2 is ubiquitously expressed in prostate cancer cell lines and significantly reduced in prostate cancer tissues with high Gleason score. Bromocriptine has weak to moderate cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells, but effectively induces cell-cycle arrest. At the molecular level, bromocriptine inhibits the expression of c-Myc, E2F-1, and survivin and increases the expression of p53, p21, and p27. Intriguingly, bromocriptine markedly reduces androgen receptor levels, partially through Hsp90-mediated protein degradation. The combination of bromocriptine and docetaxel demonstrates enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells and significantly retards the skeletal growth of C4-2-Luc tumors in mice. Collectively, these results provide the first experimental evidence for repurposing bromocriptine as an effective adjunct therapy to enhance docetaxel efficacy in prostate cancer.

ABH can automatically detect fiducial markers and initiate a beam interrupt. In this study, we investigate the practical use and results of this intrafraction monitoring tool for patients with prostate cancer who have implanted gold seeds treated with a RapidArc technique.  Methods and materials:   A total of 105 patients were included. For setup, the seeds were lined up using 2 orthogonal 2-dimensional kV images. After the setup procedure, ABH was applied at an interval of 3 seconds. The software requires a maximum-allowed deviation to be defined for each seed, which is referred to as a deviation limit (DL). Online, the ABH application evaluates the position of the seeds and indicates for each seed whether or not it exceeds the DL. Patients were divided in 3 groups. For the first group ABH was used with the DL at 6 mm, which corresponds to the planning target volume (PTV) margin. For the second group, the DL was set at 5 mm with an unchanged PTV margin of 6 mm. For the third group, the PTV margin was reduced to 5 mm with a DL of 5 mm. Offline, we performed an analysis of the number of beam stops and resulting re-setups.  Results:   ABH initiated a beam interrupt 223 times (13%) during a total of 1736 sessions. By decreasing the DL from 6 mm to 5 mm, the amount of workload for re-setups increased from 6% (group 1) to 14% (groups 2 and 3). Re-setup, 3-dimensional shifts larger than the PTV margin were found in 44%, 35%, and 45% for groups 1,2, and 3, respectively.  Conclusions:   Intrafraction imaging of prostate position during treatment using automatic detection of implanted gold seeds was successfully implemented.

Our objective was to describe the evolution of BPH day-case surgery in France according to the surgical technique employed.  Materials and methods:   We extracted data from the Information System of Medicalization Program (PMSI) including all of the hospital stays in France from 2010 to 2016. Patients belonging to the transurethral prostatectomy homogeneous group of patients (GHM 12C04) and having as a main diagnosis prostatic hyperplasia (N40) or benign prostatic tumor (D291) were included in the analysis. From March 2016, specific codes were introduced to differentiate laser surgery and other types of surgery: JGFE023 (resection without laser), JGFE365 (laser resection) and JGNE171 (laser vaporization). We described the rates of day case surgery and the average length of stay from 2010 to 2016. From March 2016 we could study the influence of laser surgery on day-case and length of stay.  Results:   Regarding the all dataset analysis we found 328,781 hospital stays (318,549 patients) for BPH surgery, of which 2.7% (9047 hospital stays) were day-case. From 2010 to 2016, the lengths of stay decreased from 5.78 to 4.29 days. In the meantime, the number of day-case procedures increased from 14 patients (0.03%) to 3035 patients (5.63%). Regarding the last 9 months of 2016, we found 38,930 hospital stays including 5.4% (2104) day-cases. In total, 92.7% of day-case procedures had been performed with a laser technique, of which 47.9% (1008) were laser vaporization and 44.8% (944) were laser resection. There were only 7.1% (151.8%) of day-case procedures performed without laser.  Conclusion:   The exponential development of the day-case procedures seems to be linked with the advent of laser technology. This tendency is expected to increase in the coming years according to the spreading of laser surgery.

The objective of this study was to establish a time limit between prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy beyond which the risks of upgradging and biochemical recurrence (BCR) are increased.  Material and methods:   Between January 2013 and January 2017, a retrospective analysis of the clinical, biological and histological data of 513 patients treated with radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer was performed in a single center. The primary endpoint was the assessment of the risk of BCR by the difference between post-biopsy USCF-CAPRA and post-surgical CAPRA-S scores. The secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the upgrading by the difference between the Gleason score on biopsy and on surgical specimen. The risks of BCR and upgrading were compared by Student test according to different delays between prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy. The shortest delays for which a significant difference was found were reported.  Results:   In this study, 513 patients were included. The median age at the time of the biopsy was 65 years (IQR: 60-69). The median preoperative PSA was 7.30ng/mL (IQR: 5.60-9.94). The median time between biopsy and surgery was 108 days (IQR: 86-141). For the entire cohort, the risk of BCR was significantly higher above a threshold of 90 days (P=0.039). No threshold was found for Gleason 6(3+3) patients. A 90-day threshold was found for Gleason 7(3+4) patients (P=0.038). Gleason patients≥8 had more upgrading beyond a 60-day threshold (P=0.040).  Conclusion:   Our study showed that after a 3 months delay, the risk of BCR was significantly higher for localized prostate cancer. It seemed possible to extend this period for low-risk patients, whereas it seemed necessary to keep it for intermediate-risks and to reduce it to 2 months for high-risks.

We herein describe methods to metallate and characterize the new conjugate and to validate its biological efficacy by in vitro and in vivo methods.  Methods:   We have previously described the development of [RGD-Glu-6Ahx-RM2] (where RGD: Arg-Gly-Asp; Glu: glutamic acid; 6-Ahx: 6-amino hexanoic acid; RM2: (D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2)) that has been conjugated to a DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) bifunctional chelating agent (BFCA) to afford [RGD-Glu-[DO3A]-6-Ahx-RM2] peptide. In this study, we have radiolabeled [RGD-Glu-[DO3A]-6-Ahx-RM2] peptide with 86Y or 90Y. Natural-metallated (natY) conjugates were assessed for binding affinity for the αVβ3 integrin or GRPR in human glioblastoma U87-MG and prostate PC-3 cell lines, respectively. The effective stability of the new tracers was also evaluated prior to in vivo evaluation in normal CF-1 mice and SCID mice bearing xenografted tumors.  Results:   Competitive displacement binding assays in PC-3 cells showed high binding affinity for the GRPR (IC50, 5.65 ± 0.00 nM). On the other hand, competitive displacement binding assays in U87-MG cells revealed only moderate binding to the αVβ3 integrin (IC50, 346 ± 5.30 nM). Biodistribution studies in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice [RGD-Glu-[[90Y]Y-DO3A]-6-Ahx-RM2] showed high tumor uptake (8.70 ± 0.35%ID/g at 1 h post-intravenous injection) and retention of tracer (5.28 ± 0.12%ID/g) at 24 h post-intravenous injection.

Sex steroids hormones are important in the biology and treatment of sex hormone-related cancer such as prostate cancer and breast cancer. Cells may take up steroids using multiple mechanisms. The conventionally accepted hypothesis that steroids cross cell membrane through passive diffusion has not been tested rigorously. Experimental data suggested that cells may take up sex steroid using an active uptake mechanism. 3H-testosterone uptake by prostate cancer cells showed typical transporter-mediated uptake kinetic. Cells retained testosterone taken up from the medium. The uptake of testosterone was selective for certain steroid hormones but not others. Data also indicated that the active and selective uptake mechanism resided in cholesterol-rich membrane domains, and may involve ATP and membrane transporters.

Design & methods:   Recombinant KLK15 protein was produced, purified to homogeneity and quantified by mass spectrometry (parallel reaction monitoring analysis). We profiled the enzymatic activity of KLK15 using fluorogenic peptide substrates, and performed kinetic analysis to discover the cleavage sites. As KLK15 has mainly been associated with prostate cancer, we used a degradomic approach and subsequent KEGG pathway analysis to identify a number of putative protein substrates in the KLK15-treated prostate cancer cell line PC3.  Results:   We discovered trypsin-like activity in KLK15, finding that it cleaves preferentially after arginine (R). The enzymatic activity of KLK15 was regulated by different factors such as pH, cations and serine protease inhibitors. Notably, we revealed that KLK15 most likely interacts with the extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor group.  Conclusion:   To our knowledge, this is the first study that experimentally verifies the trypsin-like activity of KLK15. We show here for the first time that KLK15 may be able to cleave many ECM components, similar to several members of the KLK family.

PAX2, a member of the Paired box family of transcriptional regulators, is normally expressed during embryonic development, including in the kidney, where it promotes mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). PAX2 expression is silenced in many normal adult tissues. However, in contrast, PAX2 is expressed in several cancer types, including kidney, prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer. While multiple studies have implicated TGF-β superfamily members in modulating expression of Pax genes during embryonic development, few have investigated direct regulation of Pax gene expression by TGF-β1. Here we have investigated direct regulation of PAX2 expression by TGF-β1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CC-RCC) cell lines. Treatment of PAX2-expressing 786-O and A498 CC-RCC cell lines with TGF-β1 resulted in inhibition of endogenous PAX2 mRNA and protein expression, as well as expression from transiently transfected PAX2 promoter constructs; this inhibition was abolished in the presence of expression of the inhibitory SMAD, SMAD7. Using ChIP-PCR we showed TGF-β1 treatment induced SMAD3 protein phosphorylation in 786-O cells, and direct SMAD3 binding to the human PAX2 promoter, which was inhibited by SMAD7 over-expression. Overall, these data suggest that canonical TGF-β signalling suppresses PAX2 transcription in CC-RCC cells due to the direct binding of SMAD proteins to the PAX2 promoter.

Results:   HIFU ablation was accompanied by coagulation necrosis and progressive pancreatic fibrosis with complete tumor regression or by a reduction in the number of positive columns (by an average of 58%) in cases with recurrence. An inverse relationship was found between the degree of a reduction in the nontumor parenchyma in the control specimens and the probability of a recurrence - a less than 20% reduction in the non-tumor glands corresponded to a 3.4-fold increased risk of tumor progression. The development of recurrence was associated with less differentiated PC (GS ≥4+3) and the presence of cribriform structures in the pretreatment samples. Combined androgen deprivation as the maximum blockade was associated with the most pronounced signs of therapeutic pathomorphism, with a reduction of the microcirculatory bed in the focus of residual tumor, and a decrease in the frequency of local progression.

However, processes and mechanisms that govern the expression of osteoclastogenic soluble factors secreted by prostate cancer cells are largely unknown. MacroH2A (mH2A) is a histone variant that replaces canonical H2A at designated genomic loci and establishes functionally distinct chromatin regions. Here, we report that mH2A1.2, one of the mH2A isoforms, attenuates prostate cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis by maintaining the inactive state of genes encoding soluble factors in prostate cancer cells. Our functional analyses of soluble factors identify lymphotoxin beta (LTβ) as a major stimulator of osteoclastogenesis and an essential mH2A1.2 target for its anti-osteoclastogenic activity. Mechanistically, mH2A1.2 directly interacts with HP1α and H1.2 and requires them to inactivate LTβ gene in prostate cancer cells. Consistently, HP1α and H1.2 have an intrinsic ability to inhibit osteoclast differentiation in a mH2A1.2-dependent manner.

When selecting treatments for patients with very high-risk PC, clinicians must consider patient comorbidities. We investigated the efficacy of the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI) as a prognostic factor for patient outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively investigated the medical records of PC patients at our institution who underwent RP from 1992 to 2010. Very high-risk PC was defined according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Patients with incomplete medical records or who had received neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. Preoperative comorbidity was evaluated by the ACCI, and the prognostic efficacy of the ACCI was analyzed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression, competing risk regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves.  Results:   Our final analysis included 228 men with a median age of 66 years (interquartile range 62-71) and median prostate specific antigen of 10.7 ng/mL. There were 41 (18%) patients with an ACCI score >3 and 88 (38.6%) patients with a biopsy Gleason score >8.

Nonetheless, the role of lncRNA-mediated ceRNAs in prostate cancer has not yet been elucidated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA profiles from 499 prostate cancer tissues and 52 normal prostate tissues were analyzed with the R package ""DESeq"" to identify the differentially expressed RNAs. GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed using ""DAVID6.8"" and R packages ""Clusterprofile."" The ceRNA network in prostate cancer was constructed using miRDB, miRTarBase, and TargetScan databases. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS A total of 376 lncRNAs, 33 miRNAs, and 687 mRNAs were identified as significant factors in tumorigenesis. Based on the hypothesis that the ceRNA network (lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis) is involved in prostate cancer and forms competitive interrelations between miRNA and mRNA or lncRNA, we constructed a ceRNA network that included 23 lncRNAs, 6 miRNAs, and 2 mRNAs that were differentially expressed in prostate cancer. Only 3 lncRNAs (LINC00308, LINC00355, and OSTN-AS1) had a significant association with survival (P<0.05). The 3 prostate cancer-specific lncRNA were validated in prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 using qRT-PCR.

While these results are promising, substantial heterogeneity in the mpMRI parameter values and voxel-wise prostate cancer risk has been observed both between and within regions of the prostate. This suggests that classification of prostate cancer can potentially be improved by incorporating structural information into the classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel voxel-wise classifier of prostate cancer that accounts for the anatomic structure of the prostate by Bayesian hierarchical modeling, which can be combined with post hoc spatial Gaussian kernel smoothing to account for residual spatial correlation. Our proposed classifier results in significantly improved area under the ROC curve (0.822 vs 0.729, P < .001) and sensitivity corresponding to 90% specificity (0.599 vs 0.429, P < .001), compared with a baseline model that does not account for the anatomic structure of the prostate. Furthermore, the classifier can also be applied on voxels with missing mpMRI parameters, resulting in similar performance, which is an important practical consideration that cannot be easily accommodated using regression-based classifiers.

Expression of N-cadherin is considered a hallmark of EMT in clinical prostate cancer. In this study, we determined the molecular mechanisms associated with N-cadherin expression in patients with prostate cancer. We performed laser capture microdissection of matched N-cadherin-positive and -negative prostate cancer areas from patient samples (n = 8), followed by RNA sequencing. N-cadherin expression was significantly associated with an immune-regulatory signature including profound upregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1; log2-fold change = 5.1; P = 2.98E-04). Fluorescent immunostainings of patient samples confirmed expression of IDO1 protein and also its metabolite kynurenine in primarily N-cadherin-positive areas. N-cadherin-positive areas also exhibited a local decrease of intraepithelial cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells and an increase of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (CD4+/FOXP3+). In conclusion, EMT in clinical prostate cancer is accompanied by upregulated expression of IDO1 and an increased number of regulatory T cells. These data indicate that EMT, which is an important step in tumor progression, can be protected from effective immune control in patients with prostate cancer.Significance: These findings demonstrate EMT is linked to an immunosuppressive environment in clinical prostate cancer, suggesting that patients with prostate cancer can potentially benefit from combinatorial drug therapy.

In this study, we microdissected residual prostate cancer foci in radical prostatectomies from 18 men treated with neoadjuvant-intensive androgen deprivation therapy (leuprolide, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone) and analyzed them for resistance mechanisms. Transcriptome profiling showed reduced but persistent androgen receptor (AR) activity in residual tumors, with no increase in neuroendocrine differentiation. Proliferation correlated negatively with AR activity but positively with decreased RB1 expression, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) further showed enrichment for RB1 genomic loss. In 15 cases where 2 or 3 tumor foci were microdissected, WES confirmed a common clonal origin but identified multiple oncogenic alterations unique to each focus. These findings show that subclones with oncogenic alterations found in mCRPC are present in primary prostate cancer and are selected for by neoadjuvant-intense androgen deprivation therapy. In particular, this study indicates that subclonal RB1 loss may be more common than previously appreciated in intermediate- to high-risk primary prostate cancer and may be an early event, independent of neuroendocrine differentiation, in the development of mCRPC. Comprehensive molecular analyses of primary prostate cancer may detect aggressive subclones and possibly inform adjuvant strategies to prevent recurrence.Significance: Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer selects for tumor foci with subclonal genomic alterations, which may comprise the origin of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   Ten prostate cancer patients scheduled for radiotherapy received transmitter implantation in the prostate, concomitantly with fiducial markers. Transmitter and marker positions were assessed in 3D by orthogonal kV-imaging at daily treatment setup in eight patients.  Results:   The transmitter was successfully implanted in all patients.

The effect of plan optimization on low-to-intermediate Rwall dose and the potential benefit of an endorectal balloon (ERB) are investigated.  Methods:   Ten prostate cancer patients, simulated with and without an ERB, were planned to receive 36.25Gy (7.25Gyx5) to the planning treatment volume (PTV) and 32.5Gy to the urethral planning risk volume (uPRV). Reference plans with and without the ERB, optimized with respect to PTV and uPRV coverage objectives and the organs at risk dose constraints, were further optimized using a standardized stepwise approach to push down dose constraints to the Rwall in the low to intermediate range in five sequential steps to obtain paired plans with and without ERB (Vm1 to Vm5). Homogeneity index for the PTV and the uPRV, and the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for the PTV were analyzed. Dosimetric parameters for Rwall including the median dose and the dose received by 10 to 60% of the Rwall, bladder wall (Bwall) and femoral heads (FHeads) were compared. The monitor units (MU) per plan were recorded.  Results:   Vm4 reduced by half D30%, D40%, D50%, and Dmed for Rwall and decreased by a third D60% while HIPTV, HIuPRV and DSC remained stable with and without ERB compared to Vmref. HIPTV worsened at Vm5 both with and without ERB. No statistical differences were observed between paired plans on Rwall, Bwall except a higher D2% for Fheads with and without an ERB.  Conclusions:   Further optimization to the Rwall in the context of urethra sparing prostate SBRT is feasible without compromising the dose homogeneity to the target.

Methods:   Retrospective analysis was conducted in 107 patients who underwent mpMRI prior to radical prostatectomy (RP) at a single institution.

The current assessment is to understand the variability of detecting high-risk PC in a NZ cohort in comparison to a US cohort with better PSA screening facilities. Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) is known for multiple functions with a potential to regulate subsequent PSA levels. Therefore, we wish to understand the influence of tobacco smoking and the AKR1C3 rs12529 gene polymorphism in this variability.  Method:   NZ cohort (n = 376) consisted of 94% Caucasians while the US cohort consisted of African Americans (AA), n = 202, and European Americans (EA), n = 232. PSA level, PC grade and stage at diagnosis were collected from hospital databases for assigning high-risk PC status. Tobacco smoking status and the AKR1C3 rs12529 SNP genotype were considered as confounding variables. Variation of the cumulative % high-risk PC (outcome variable) with increasing PSA intervals (exposure factor) was compared between the cohorts using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Comparisons were carried out with and without stratifications made using confounding variables.  Results:   NZ cohort has been diagnosed at a significantly higher mean age (66.67± (8.08) y) compared to both AA (62.65±8.17y) and EA (64.83+8.56y); median PSA (NZ 8.90ng/ml compared to AA 6.86ng/ml and EA 5.80ng/ml); and Gleason sum (NZ (7) compared EA (6)) (p<0.05). The cumulative % high-risk PC detection shows NZ cohort with a significantly lower diagnosis rates at PSA levels between >6 - <10ng/ml compared to both US groups (p<0.05). These were further compounded significantly by smoking status and genetics.  Conclusions:   High-risk PCs recorded at higher PSA levels in NZ could be due to factors including lower levels of PSA screening and subsequent specialist referrals for biopsies. These consequences could be pronounced among NZ ever smokers carrying the AKR1C3 rs12529 G alleles making them a group that requires increased PSA screening attention.""","""['Nishi Karunasinghe', 'Stefan Ambs', 'Alice Wang', 'Wei Tang', 'Shuotun Zhu', 'Tiffany H Dorsey', 'Megan Goudie', 'Jonathan G Masters', 'Lynnette R Ferguson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Influence of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 polymorphisms in early-onset female psoriasis patients.', 'Assessment of factors associated with PSA level in prostate cancer cases and controls from three geographical regions.', 'Interaction between leukocyte aldo-keto reductase 1C3 activity, genotypes, biological, lifestyle and clinical features in a prostate cancer cohort from New Zealand.', 'Quality of life effects of androgen deprivation therapy in a prostate cancer cohort in New Zealand: can we minimize effects using a stratification based on the aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C3 rs12529 gene polymorphism?', 'Influence of Aldo-keto Reductase 1C3 in Prostate Cancer - A Mini Review.', 'Influence of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 polymorphisms in early-onset female psoriasis patients.', 'Germline Mutations in Steroid Metabolizing Enzymes: A Focus on Steroid Transforming Aldo-Keto Reductases.', 'Assessment of factors associated with PSA level in prostate cancer cases and controls from three geographical regions.', 'Interaction between leukocyte aldo-keto reductase 1C3 activity, genotypes, biological, lifestyle and clinical features in a prostate cancer cohort from New Zealand.']"""

We aimed to evaluate the association between average lifetime alcohol intakes and risk of both cancer incidence and mortality.  Methods and findings:   We report a population-based cohort study using data from 99,654 adults (68.7% female), aged 55-74 years, participating in the U.S. Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the risk of overall and cause-specific mortality, cancer incidence (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), and combined risk of cancer and death across categories of self-reported average lifetime alcohol intakes, with adjustment for potential confounders. During 836,740 person-years of follow-up (median 8.9 years), 9,599 deaths and 12,763 primary cancers occurred. Positive linear associations were observed between lifetime alcohol consumption and cancer-related mortality and total cancer incidence. J-shaped associations were observed between average lifetime alcohol consumption and overall mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, and combined risk of death or cancer. In comparison to lifetime light alcohol drinkers (1-3 drinks per week), lifetime never or infrequent drinkers (<1 drink/week), as well as heavy (2-<3 drinks/day) and very heavy drinkers (3+ drinks/day) had increased overall mortality and combined risk of cancer or death. Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for combined risk of cancer or death, respectively, were 1.09 (1.01-1.13) for never drinkers, 1.08 (1.03-1.13) for infrequent drinkers, 1.10 (1.02-1.18) for heavy drinkers, and 1.21 (1.13-1.30) for very heavy drinkers. This analysis is limited to older adults, and residual confounding by socioeconomic factors is possible.  Conclusions:   The study supports a J-shaped association between alcohol and mortality in older adults, which remains after adjustment for cancer risk. The results indicate that intakes below 1 drink per day were associated with the lowest risk of death.

However, the high uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in kidneys can create halo-artifacts resulting in lower detection sensitivity for lesions adjacent to the kidneys. In this study, we developed two 68Ga-labeled PSMA-targeted tracers, 68Ga-HTK01166 and 68Ga-HTK01167, based on 68Ga-PSMA-617 with the goal of improving tumor-to-kidney ratio compared to 68Ga-PSMA-11.

The tumor-to-kidney ratios for 68Ga-labeled PSMA-11, PSMA-617, HTK01166, and HTK01167 were 0.05 ± 0.02, 0.63 ± 0.10, 0.10 ± 0.02, and 1.98 ± 0.63, respectively. Compared with 68Ga-PSMA-617, 68Ga-HTK01166 showed comparable tumor uptake and almost 5-fold higher kidney uptake, whereas 68Ga-HTK01167 exhibited lower tumor and kidney uptake. Compared with 68Ga-PSMA-11, 68Ga-HTK01167 had similar tumor uptake and tumor-to-blood contrast ratio (23.8 ± 6.71 vs 20.4 ± 4.98) but higher tumor-to-background contrast ratios for other background organs especially for kidneys.

However, the regulation of EPHA3 in PCa remains largely unknown. This study is aimed to investigate the association between EPHA3 expression and androgen receptor (AR) signaling and the potential mechanism. We determined mRNA and protein levels of EPHA3 and AR signaling‑related genes in the PCa cell line 22Rv1 by reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) and western blotting, respectively. The EPHA3 mRNA and protein levels were both found to be elevated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) hormone in a dose‑ and time‑dependent manner, as AR and prostate‑specific antigen (PSA) expression were increased. Similarly, EPHA3 protein levels were also increased in the PCa cell line LNCaP stimulated with DHT or mibolerone (Mib). Overexpression of pEGFP‑AR in 22Rv1 cells significantly increased the EphA3 level, while AR knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for AR (siAR) markedly decreased the expression of EPHA3. The key EPHA3 promoter region associated with AR regulation was evaluated by co‑transfection of various pGL3‑basic‑luciferase reporter plasmids, containing EPHA3 core promoter fragments differing in length, with the AR plasmid or siAR into 22Rv1 cells. AR overexpression in 22Rvl cells raised the EphA3 promoter transcription activity of pGL3‑EPHA3‑Luc (EPHA3‑Luc)‑789, and vice versa. Similarly, luciferase activity of EPHA3‑Luc‑317 was also clearly affected. However, truncated EPHA3‑Luc‑237 without the transcription factor specific protein 1 (SP1) binding sites or EPHA3‑Luc‑789ΔSP1 with modified SP1 binding sites clearly decreased EPHA3 promoter activity regardless of whether AR was overexpressed or blocked. Treatment of 22Rv1 cells with 10 and 100 nM of the SP1 inhibitor mithramycin A for 24 and 48 h significantly reduced EPHA3 mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, selective inhibition of SP1 with siRNA SP1 (siSP1) at various concentration from 25 to 75 nM, reduced the EPHA3 protein level in PCa LNCaP cells, accordingly. Co‑immunoprecipitation (co‑IP) and chromatin IP (ChIP) assays were performed to determine whether AR forms a transcription factor complex with Sp1 that binds the EPHA3 core promoter region to sense androgen induction. The result suggests that the interaction of AR and SP1 contributes to regulate EPHA3 expression, and the SP1 binding sites (‑295~‑261) in the EPHA3 core promoter region is crucial to the regulation of EPHA3 expression in response to androgen hormone stimuli.""","""['Xiaowei Diao', 'Xiubin Chen', 'Yurui Pi', 'Yu Zhang', 'Fangfang Wang', 'Ping Liu', 'Yanhong Gao', 'Xiaojun Wang', 'Sijun Yang', 'Shan Lu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Androgen receptor controls EGFR and ERBB2 gene expression at different levels in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Involvement of transcription factor Sp1 in quercetin-mediated inhibitory effect on the androgen receptor in human prostate cancer cells.', 'FOXM1 promotes the progression of prostate cancer by regulating PSA gene transcription.', 'Androgen signal transduction and prostatic carcinoma.', 'The androgen receptor messenger RNA: what do we know?', 'The Ephrin tyrosine kinase a3 (EphA3) is a novel mediator of RAGE-prompted motility of breast cancer cells.', 'Second generation androgen receptor antagonist, TQB3720 abrogates prostate cancer growth via AR/GPX4 axis activated ferroptosis.', 'The Hippo effector YAP1/TEAD1 regulates EPHA3 expression to control cell contact and motility.', 'The androgen receptor inhibits transcription of GPER1 by preventing Sp1 and Sp3 from binding to the promoters in prostate cancer cells.', 'MED19 alters AR occupancy and gene expression in prostate cancer cells, driving MAOA expression and growth under low androgen.']"""

Studies have demonstrated that small integrin‑binding ligand N‑linked glycoproteins (SIBLINGs), particularly bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin (OPN), are involved in neoplastic growth and metastasis. SIBLINGs promote malignant cell invasion and metastasis by enhancing matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP‑2) and MMP‑9 expression. Moreover, BSP and OPN can combine with integrin, which is located on the tumor cell surface, to further promote the malignant behavior of tumor cells. In the present study, we investigated whether SB225002, a specific CXCR2 receptor antagonist, can inhibit prostate cancer cell expression of BSP and OPN and reduce cancer cell invasion ability. A series of experiments showed that after SB225002 treatment, the proliferation, invasion and migration of two androgen‑independent prostate cancer cell lines were inhibited, but this inhibitory effect was not observed on androgen‑dependent prostate cancer cells. Western blotting showed that the PI3K signaling pathway could regulate the expression of SIBLING and MMP family proteins, and SB22055 could reduce the expression of BSP, OPN and MMP‑2 in prostate cancer cells by inhibiting AKT/mTOR phosphorylation. Finally, in vivo experiments confirmed that SB225002 inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vivo, and the expression levels of BSP, OPN and MMP‑2 were also inhibited.""","""['Meng Xu', 'Huamao Jiang', 'Haiguang Wang', 'Jiajie Liu', 'Baohao Liu', 'Zhongqiang Guo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['A short-hairpin RNA targeting osteopontin downregulates MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions in prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'Up-regulation of SIBLING proteins and correlation with cognate MMP expression in oral cancer.', 'Expression of the SIBLINGs and their MMP partners in human benign and malignant prostate neoplasms.', 'Bone sialoprotein and osteopontin in bone metastasis of osteotropic cancers.', 'The role of the SIBLING, Bone Sialoprotein in skeletal biology - Contribution of mouse experimental genetics.', 'Involvement in Tumorigenesis and Clinical Significance of CXCL1 in Reproductive Cancers: Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Endometrial Cancer, Ovarian Cancer and Prostate Cancer.', 'CXCL1: Gene, Promoter, Regulation of Expression, mRNA Stability, Regulation of Activity in the Intercellular Space.', 'Chronic and Cycling Hypoxia: Drivers of Cancer Chronic Inflammation through HIF-1 and NF-κB Activation: A Review of the Molecular Mechanisms.', 'AKT in Bone Metastasis of Solid Tumors: A Comprehensive Review.', 'The Effect of Hypoxia on the Expression of CXC Chemokines and CXC Chemokine Receptors-A Review of Literature.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT scans from 28 patients with metastatic prostate cancer examined before initiation and after completion of therapy. Eight of these patients had been treated with androgen deprivation therapy, 10 with docetaxel, and another 10 with external beam radiotherapy. On the CT images from SPECT/CT, treatment response was assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria; independently from that analysis, maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were quantified in representative tumor lesions and treatment response assumed at differences in SUVmax greater than 30%. Radiographic response assessment was correlated to biochemical response (BR) based on prostate-specific antigen serum levels.  Results:   The concordance rate between SPECT and BR was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.89) (Cohen κ = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.29-0.85; P ≤ 0.01), higher than for that between SPECT and CT with 57% (95% CI, 0.37-0.76) (κ = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.14-0.65; P ≤ 0.01), as well as that between CT and BR with 50% (95% CI, 0.31-0.69) (κ = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.06-0.57, P ≤ 0.05). Discordant findings between SPECT and CT were most likely due to limitations of CT in assessing metastases in lymph nodes, as well as bone involvement, which was sometimes not detectable on CT scans.  Conclusions:   The high agreement between treatment response, as assessed by Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT and BR, suggests a possible role of that imaging tool for monitoring treatment in metastatic prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Patients with BCR after curatively intended treatment of prostate cancer were included. Each patient underwent a Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Changes in patient management based on the results of Ga-PSMA PET/CT were assessed.  Results:   Seventy patients were included. Sixty-four patients (91%) had radical prostatectomy, of whom 17 patients (24%) received salvage radiation therapy due to first biochemical relapse. Six patients (9%) underwent radiation therapy as the primary treatment. Ga-PSMA PET/CT detected recurrent disease in 37 patients (53%). The detection rate was 22% for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels up to 0.5 ng/mL compared with 83% for PSA levels greater than 0.5 ng/mL. Pathological uptake of Ga-PSMA was observed in 4 (16%) of 21, 4 (44%) of 9, 0 of 1, 7 (70%) of 10, and 22 (88%) of 25 patients with PSA levels from 0.2 to 0.3 ng/mL, 0.31 to 0.4 ng/mL, 0.41 to 0.5 ng/mL, 0.51 to 1 ng/mL, and greater than 1 ng/mL, respectively.

We hypothesized that men's maximizing-minimizing preferences might have relevance in the case of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, since there is considerable variability in men's preference for being screened even among men who are informed that harm is more likely than benefit. The current research examined whether MMS preferences predict how men respond to didactic information and narrative stories about PSA screening.  Design:   US men 40+ years old ( N = 1208) participated in an online survey. Men viewed information about PSA screening in 3 phases and provided their preference for screening after each phase. Phase 1 described what PSA screening is. Phase 2 added didactic information about screening risks and benefits. Phase 3 added narrative stories; men were randomized to receive stories about 1) physical harm, 2) emotional harm, 3) overdiagnosis, or 4) all 3 stories. Participants also completed the validated MMS.  Results:   After receiving basic information, 76.8% of men wanted PSA screening. After receiving information about risks and benefits, 54.8% wanted screening (a significant reduction, P < 0.001). Men who changed their preferences were significantly more likely to be minimizers than maximizers; most men with maximizing tendencies wanted screening after both the didactic information and narratives, whereas most men with minimizing tendencies did not want the test after receiving information.

However, the undiscovered function of miR-30d-5p and whether it targeted NT5E in PCa remain uncertain. In this study, the authors observed miR-30d-5p was significantly downregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines compared with the adjacent normal tissues and normal prostate cells, respectively. The lower expression of miR-30d-5p was found to be inversely correlated with the NT5E expression in PCa tissues. Subsequently, the biological function of miR-30d-5p was evaluated in PCa in vitro. The results indicated that miR-30d-5p overexpression inhibited PCa cell growth and invasion by MTT, Transwell assays, respectively, as well as induced cell cycle G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis using flow cytometry analysis. In addition, miR-30d-5p directly bound to the 3'UTR (3' untranslated region) of NT5E in DU-145 and PC-3 cells by luciferase reporter assay.

The use of non-toxic natural or natural-derived products has been one of the current strategies for cancer therapy, owing to the reduced risks of induced-chemoresistance development and the absence of secondary effects. In this perspective, lactoferrin (Lf), a natural protein derived from milk, emerges as a promising anticancer agent due to its well-recognized cytotoxicity and anti-metastatic activity. Here, we aimed to ascertain the potential activity of bovine Lf (bLf) against highly metastatic cancer cells. The bLf effect on prostate PC-3 and osteosarcoma MG-63 cell lines, both displaying plasmalemmal V-ATPase, was studied and compared with the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and the non-tumorigenic BJ-5ta cell lines. Cell proliferation, cell death, intracellular pH, lysosomal acidification, and extracellular acidification rate were evaluated. Results show that bLf inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis, intracellular acidification, and perturbs lysosomal acidification only in highly metastatic cancer cell lines. By contrast, BJ-5ta cells are insensitive to bLf. Overall, our results establish a common mechanism of action of bLf against highly metastatic cancer cells exhibiting plasmalemmal V-ATPase. This study opens promising perspectives for further research on the anticancer role of Lf, which ultimately will contribute to its safer and more rational application in the human therapy of these life-threatening cancers.""","""['Joana P Guedes', 'Cátia S Pereira', 'Lígia R Rodrigues', 'Manuela Côrte-Real']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Lactoferrin selectively triggers apoptosis in highly metastatic breast cancer cells through inhibition of plasmalemmal V-H+-ATPase.', 'Lactoferrin perturbs intracellular trafficking, disrupts cholesterol-rich lipid rafts and inhibits glycolysis of highly metastatic cancer cells harbouring plasmalemmal V-ATPase.', 'Molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of bovine lactoferrin on osteosarcoma.', 'Utilization of lactoferrin to fight antibiotic-resistant mammary gland pathogens.', 'Twenty-five years of research on bovine lactoferrin applications.', 'Synergistic action of lactoferrin in enhancing the safety and effectiveness of docetaxel treatment against prostate cancer.', 'Antitumor activity of bovine lactoferrin and its derived peptides against HepG2 liver cancer cells and Jurkat leukemia cells.', 'Effects of Curcumin and Lactoferrin to Inhibit the Growth and Migration of Prostatic Cancer Cells.', 'Human Lactoferrin Synergizes with Etoposide to Inhibit Lung Adenocarcinoma Cell Growth While Attenuating Etoposide-Mediated Cytotoxicity of Human Endothelial Cells.', 'Bovine Lactoferrin Induces Cell Death in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Results:   Protein truncating variants (PTVs) in specific DNA repair genes were significantly overrepresented among patients with the aggressive phenotype, with BRCA2, ATM and NBN the most frequently mutated genes. Differential burden of rare variants was identified between metastatic and non-aggressive cases for several genes implicated in angiogenesis, conferring both deleterious and protective effects.

Methods:   Semi-structured interviews with a purposively selected group of healthcare professionals involved in prostate cancer care within the NHS, conducted over the phone or face to face. A total of 37 healthcare professionals participated in the interviews including urologists, clinical oncologists, medical oncologists, clinical nurse specialists, general practitioners, physiotherapists, exercise specialists, service managers, clinical commissioners and primary care physicians.  Results:   The availability of newer treatments for advanced prostate cancer as well as results from the STAMPEDE and CHAARTED trials has resulted in new challenges for patients and HCPs. This includes the impact of an increased workload on oncologists, a potential lack of clinical continuity between urology and oncology and uncertainties regarding optimal selection, timing and sequencing of chemotherapy and second-line treatment. Fitness for treatment in advanced prostate cancer populations remains a significant barrier to accessing therapies for patients with a poor performance status. Among this, muscle wastage can significantly affect performance status and consequentially compromise cancer therapy. Exercise was regarded as a potential therapy to mitigate the adverse-effects of treatment including the prevention or reduction in muscle wastage.  Conclusions:   There is a lack of data guiding clinicians in this post STAMPEDE and CHAARTED era, work is needed to reassess and optimize the prostate cancer care pathway as it evolves.

It can be applied for virtual screening experiments but also for predicting molecular initiating events in toxicology. However, in case of AR, there is no antagonist-bound crystal structure yet available. Our study demonstrates that molecular docking approaches are not able to satisfactorily screen for AR antagonists because of this reason. Therefore, we applied Molecular Dynamics simulations to generate antagonist AR structures and showed that this leads to a vast improvement for the docking of AR antagonists. We benchmarked the ability of these antagonist AR structures discriminate between AR antagonists and decoys using an ensemble docking approach and obtained promising results with good enrichment.

Methods:   Our analysis included 106 patients, with localized prostate cancer and no erectile dysfunction (ED) before RARP, assessed with preoperative 3 Tesla (3 T) multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). FP score was defined as the extent of FP from the base to the apex of the prostate, quantitatively assessed by the surgeon. Median fascia thickness (MFT) per patient was defined as the sum of the median FT of 12 MRI regions. Preserved MFT (pMFT) was the sum of the saved MFT. The percentage of pFMT (ppMFT) was also calculated. Fascia surface (FS) was measured on MRI and it was combined with FP score resulting in preserved FS (pFS) and percentage of pFS (ppFS).  Results:   FP score, pMFT, ppMFT, pFS and ppFS were significantly lower (p < 0.0001) in patients with ED.

An important question for funding agencies is whether the conduct of large chemoprevention trials provides strong scientific return on investment.  Methods:   We evaluated the scientific impact of four large chemoprevention trials - two for breast cancer and two for prostate cancer - using citation analysis, a bibliometric technique. The results were compared to the scientific impact of a series of treatment trials conducted over the same 20-year time period (1991-2010, inclusive). Average annual citation counts were compared using t-tests. Scientific impact was also assessed relative to trial costs.  Results:   Twenty-seven treatment trials with 17,208 patients and four chemoprevention trials with 87,550 patients were examined. The mean annual citation rate for primary articles was higher for chemoprevention trials compared to treatment trials (188.1 vs. 40.4, p = .001). For both primary and secondary article publications, mean annual citations for articles associated with chemoprevention trials were also higher (483.9 vs. 69.0, p = .0003). Large chemoprevention trials were estimated to provide 50% more total citations from primary and secondary articles on a cost-adjusted basis.  Conclusion:   Based on these criteria, the scientific impact of large phase III cancer chemoprevention trials was very high in absolute terms, and as good as or better than that of treatment trials after accounting for expenditure. For appropriate scientific questions, large chemoprevention trials provide a good scientific return on investment for federal funding agencies.""","""['Joseph M Unger', 'William E Barlow', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'Scott D Ramsey', 'Ian M Thompson Jr', 'Eric A Klein', 'Michael LeBlanc', 'Charles D Blanke', 'Phyllis J Goodman', 'Lori M Minasian', 'Van T Nghiem', 'Dawn L Hershman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['The Scientific Impact of Positive and Negative Phase 3 Cancer Clinical Trials.', 'Phase III, large-scale chemoprevention trials.

Methods and materials:   From 08/2007 to 01/2013, 193 patients underwent 125Iodine PB for low-risk or favorable intermediate-risk prostate adenocarcinoma. Inclusion criteria were as follows: no incontinence (International Continence Society Index initial score = 0) and good erectile function (International Index of Erectile Function-5 items: >16). One hundred patients were included (mean age: 64 y). Postimplantation intake of phosphodiesterase inhibitors was not considered as failure. The ""Quadrella"" index was defined by the absence of biochemical recurrence (Phoenix criteria), significant erectile dysfunction (ED) (Index of Erectile Function-5 items: >16), urinary toxicity (UT) (International Prostate Score Symptom [IPSS] <15 or IPSS> 15 with ΔIPSS <5), and rectal toxicity (RT) (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group = 0).  Results:   At 12 months, 90 patients were evaluable: 42/90 (46.7%) achieved Quadrella. The main criteria for failure were as follows: ED in 77.1% (37/48) of cases, RT in 20.8% (10/48) of cases, and UT in 12.5% (9/57) of cases. At 24 and 36 months, 59.3% (48/81) and 61.1% (44/72) of patients achieved Quadrella, respectively.

Methods and materials:   In total, 2216 prostate cancer patients underwent iodine-125 BT with or without EBRT between 2003 and 2013. The median followup was 6.9 years. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used for univariate and multivariate analyses to assess clinical and dosimetric factors associated with rectal toxicity. Dosimetric parameters from 1 day after implantation (Day 1) and 1 month after implantation (Day 30) were included in the analyses.  Results:   The 7-year cumulative incidence of Grade 2 or higher rectal toxicity was 5.7% in all patients. The multivariate analysis revealed that antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy, treatment modality, Day 1 rectal volume receiving 100% of the prescribed dose (RV100), and the Day 30 minimal percent of the prescribed dose delivered to 30% of the rectum (RD30) were associated with rectal toxicity.

The expression of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3), which catalyses the reduction of weak androgens to more potent androgens, is significantly increased in CRPC tumours. The oxidation of androgens to their inactive form is catalysed by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (17βHSD2), but little attention is given to the expression levels of this enzyme. In this study, we show that the 11-oxygenated androgen precursors of adrenal origin are the preferred substrate for AKR1C3. In particular we show that the enzymatic efficiency of AKR1C3 is 8- and 24-fold greater for 11-ketoandrostenedione than for the classic substrates androstenedione and 5α-androstanedione, respectively. Using three independent experimental systems and a computational model we subsequently show that increased ratios of AKR1C3:17βHSD2 significantly favours the flux through the 11-oxygenated androgen pathway as compared to the classical or 5α-androstanedione pathways. Our findings reveal that the flux through the classical and 5α-androstanedione pathways are limited by the low catalytic efficiently of AKR1C3 towards classical androgens combined with the high catalytic efficiency of 17βHSD2, and that the expression of the oxidative enzyme therefore plays a vital role in determining the steady state concentration of active androgens. Using microarray data from prostate tissue we confirm that the AKR1C3:17βHSD2 ratio is significantly increased in patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy as compared to benign tissue, and further increased in patients with CRPC. Taken together this study therefore demonstrates that the ratio of AKR1C3:17βHSD2 is more important than AKR1C3 expression alone in determining intratumoral androgen levels and that 11-oxygenated androgens may play a bigger role in CRPC than previously anticipated.""","""['Monique Barnard', 'Jonathan L Quanson', 'Elahe Mostaghel', 'Elzette Pretorius', 'Jacky L Snoep', 'Karl-Heinz Storbeck']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Overexpression of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) in LNCaP cells diverts androgen metabolism towards testosterone resulting in resistance to the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride.', 'AKR1C3 Inhibitor KV-37 Exhibits Antineoplastic Effects and Potentiates Enzalutamide in Combination Therapy in Prostate Adenocarcinoma Cells.', 'Peripheral blood mononuclear cells preferentially activate 11-oxygenated androgens.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'AKR1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/prostaglandin F synthase): Roles in malignancy and endocrine disorders.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Novel aldo-keto reductase 1C3 inhibitor affects androgen metabolism but not ovarian function in healthy women: a phase 1 study.', 'Circulating adrenal 11-oxygenated androgens are associated with clinical outcome in endometrial cancer.', 'Antiandrogenic Effects of a Polyphenol in Carex kobomugi through Inhibition of Androgen Synthetic Pathway and Downregulation of Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to assess the detection efficacy and diagnostic accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT image in patients with rising prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) after treatment of PC.  Materials and methods:   The present prospective study included 188 patients who exhibited rising of PSA level on a routine follow-up examination after definitive treatment of PC. All patients underwent a 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT examination. For each patient, we determined the disease stage, the Gleason score, and the maximum standardized uptake value of the local recurrence and extraprostatic metastases. The detection efficacy and diagnostic accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT were established by histopathology and clinical and imaging follow-up as the reference standards.  Results: 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT detected tumour relapse in 165 patients (35 patients had local recurrence, 106 patients had extraprostatic metastases, and 24 patients had combined lesions). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT examination in the detection of PC recurrence were 98.8%, 100%, and 98.8%, respectively. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT revealed an overall detection rate of 87.8% (165/188) in patients with rising PSA (median of 2.2 ng/mL, and range of 0.01-70 ng/mL).

Levobupivacaine induced a combined inhibition of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells, resulting in a reduced cellular ATP production and consecutive bioenergetic crisis, along with reactive oxygen species generation. The dose-dependent inhibition of respiratory chain complex I activity by levobupivacaine explained the alteration of mitochondrial energy fluxes. Furthermore, the potency of levobupivacaine varied with glucose and oxygen availability as well as the cellular energy demand, in accordance with a bioenergetic anti-cancer mechanism. The levobupivacaine-induced bioenergetic crisis triggered cytostasis in prostate cancer cells as evidenced by a S-phase cell cycle arrest, without apoptosis induction. In DU145 cells, levobupivacaine also triggered the induction of autophagy and blockade of this process potentialized the anti-cancer effect of the local anesthetic.

A sandwich-type immunosensor for the sensitive and selective detection of PSA in serum samples was ingeniously designed based on the pair of Nbs. The small size of Nb40 allowed high capture densities on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposed with massive Au nanoparticles (rGO@AuNPs), which significantly improved the conductivity and provided a large area to anchor many primary antibodies. The secondary antibody Nb2 fused with streptavidin -binding peptide (SBP) cooperated with Nb40 for PSA sandwiching.

The number needed to screen is a measure of screening efficiency, but is not directly associated with adenoma removal. We propose the following 2 new metrics for quantifying the relationship between adenoma removal and CRC prevented: number of adenomas needed to remove (NNR) and adenoma dwell time avoided (DTA).  Methods:   We collected data from 4 randomized trials of sigmoidoscopy screening (1 in the United States and 3 in Europe) to assess NNR and DTA. For each trial, NNR was computed as the number of adenomas removed from subjects in the intervention group, divided by the number of CRCs prevented. DTA was computed similarly but taking into account the timing of adenoma removal. Combined results across trials were assessed using standard meta-analytic techniques.  Results:   The estimated NNR for the PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian) trial was 74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 56-110), for the NORCCAP (Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention) trial was 71 (95% CI, 44-174), for the SCORE (Screening for Colon Rectum) trial was 27 (95% CI, 14-135), and for the UKFSST (UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening Trial) was 36 (95% CI, 28-52). The combined estimate (meta-analysis) of NNR was 52 (95% CI, 36-93) assuming heterogeneity (P for heterogeneity = .014). DTA estimates among trials ranged from 278 to 730 years, with a combined estimate of 500 (95% CI, 344-833) years assuming heterogeneity (P for heterogeneity = .035), or 2 CRC cases prevented per 1000 adenoma dwell years avoided. The combined estimates of NNR and DTA restricted to advanced adenomas were 13 (95% CI, 9-22) and 122 (95% CI, 90-190) years, respectively.  Conclusions:   We collected data from 4 randomized trials of sigmoidoscopy screening for CRC to develop metrics of endoscopic efficiency, NNR and DTA, which are directly linked to adenoma detection and removal.

TRUS biopsy involves tissue removal, and suffers from low core yield as well as high false negative rate. A less invasive and more accurate diagnostic procedure for prostate cancer is therefore highly desired. Combining the optical sensitivity and ultrasonic resolution to resolve the spatial distribution of the major molecular components in tissue, photoacoustic (PA) technology could be an alternative approach for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of identifying aggressive prostate cancer using interstitial PA measurements.  Methods:   Seventeen patients with prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), TRUS biopsies, and planned prostatectomies were enrolled in this study. The interstitial PA measurements were achieved using our recently developed needle PA probe, which was inserted into the ex vivo prostates in the fashion of a biopsy needle. A total of 70 interstitial PA measurements were acquired. The PA measurements were quantified by a previously established PA physio-chemical analysis (PAPCA) method. The histology has confirmed the nonaggressive and aggressive cancerous conditions at the insertion locations. The diagnostic accuracy was also compared to that provided by the prebiopsy MRI.  Results:   The quantitative study shows significant differences between the individual parameters of the nonaggressive and the aggressive cancerous regions (P < 0.005). Multivariate analysis of the quantitative features achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 78.6% for differentiating nonaggressive and aggressive prostate cancer tissues.

Methods:   Between July 2005 and June 2007, 2316 clinically localized patients underwent permanent seed implantation. The primary endpoint was bRFS. One of the secondary endpoints was overall survival (OS).  Results:   The median age was 69 and performance status was 0 in 99.1% of participants. The median biologically effective dose (BED) was about 180 Gy2. During a median follow-up of 60.0 months, 8.4 and 5.9% had PSA failure by the Phoenix and the J-POPS definitions, respectively. The 5-year bRFSs based on the Phoenix and the J-POPS definitions were 89.1 and 91.6%, respectively. The 5-year OS was 97.3%.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of the BET-inhibitor PFI-1 to diminish AR/AR-V7 signaling and proliferation in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Prostate-specific antigen and androgen receptor (AR) protein were quantified by means of two commercial ELISAs. Transactivation of the AR, AR-V7 and Q641X was determined by reporter gene assays. Cell proliferation was measured using a colorimetric MTT-assay.  Results:   PFI-1 dose-dependently inhibited transactivation of full-length AR (non- mutated, i.e., wild-type or point-mutated/promiscuous forms) without affecting their cellular protein levels. Moreover, PFI-1 was active against C-terminally truncated constitutively active ARs like AR-V7 and Q641X. Prostate cancer cells exhibiting a transcriptionally active AR-signaling complex (LNCaP, 22Rv1) were more susceptible to the growth-inhibitory effects than the AR-negative PC-3 cells.  Conclusion:   The quinazolinone PFI-1 is a highly efficient inhibitor of AR-signaling-competent prostate cancer cells in vitro.

Proliferating cells have higher need for nutrients and oxygen, triggering angiogenesis that plays a critical role in tumor growth, progression and metastasis. Consequently, immense focus has converged onto inhibitors of angiogenesis in cancer treatment, such as Nintedanib, which has shown exceptional antitumor activity via inhibiting cell proliferation and the resulting tumor growth, primarily due to its combined action on tumor cells, endothelial cells and pericytes. Accordingly, here we assessed both in vitro and in vivo efficacy of Nintedanib in PCa. The results showed that Nintedanib decreased cell viability in both androgen dependent- and -independent PCa cells, together with a decrease in cell motility and invasiveness. Nintedanib also reduced the expression of significant genes responsible for cell cycle progression. PCa PC3 xenograft-carrying nude mice treated with Nintedanib showed significantly decreased tumor volume and cell proliferation alongside diminished levels of pro-angiogenic molecules and blood vessel densities. In conclusion, we report that Nintedanib has strong efficacy against PCa in pre-clinical models via modulation of various pathways, and that it could be employed as a promising new strategy to manage PCa clinically.""","""['Raquel Frenedoso da Silva', 'Deepanshi Dhar', 'Komal Raina', 'Dileep Kumar', 'Rama Kant', 'Valeria Helena Alves Cagnon', 'Chapla Agarwal', 'Rajesh Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Nintedanib antiangiogenic inhibitor effectiveness in delaying adenocarcinoma progression in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP).', 'Multiple Molecular pathways explain the anti-proliferative effect of valproic acid on prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Antiangiogenic therapy with Nintedanib affects hypoxia, angiogenesis and apoptosis in the ventral prostate of TRAMP animals.', 'Silibinin inhibits fibronectin induced motility, invasiveness and survival in human prostate carcinoma PC3 cells via targeting integrin signaling.', 'Prostate cancer chemoprevention by silibinin: bench to bedside.', 'Lobe-specific responses of TRAMP mice dorsolateral prostate following celecoxib and nintedanib therapy.', 'Computational drug discovery for castration-resistant prostate cancers through in vitro drug response modeling.', 'Stage-Specific Effect of Inositol Hexaphosphate on Cancer Stem Cell Pool during Growth and Progression of Prostate Tumorigenesis in TRAMP Model.', 'Comparative Pre-clinical Efficacy of Chinese and Indian Cultivars of Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia) against Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Bitter melon juice intake with gemcitabine intervention circumvents resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic patient-derived xenograft tumors.']"""

Although 5-year survival of patients with localized prostate cancer approaches 100%, survival decreases precipitously after metastasis. Bone is the preferred site for disseminated prostate cancer cell colonization, altering the equilibrium of bone homeostasis resulting in weak and fragile bones. Currently, no curative options are available for prostate cancer bone metastasis. Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (MDA-7)/IL24 is a well-studied cytokine established as a therapeutic in a wide array of cancers upon delivery as a gene therapy. In this study, we explored the potential anticancer properties of MDA-7/IL24 delivered as a recombinant protein. Using bone metastasis experimental models, animals treated with recombinant MDA-7/IL24 had significantly less metastatic lesions in their femurs as compared with controls. The inhibitory effects of MDA-7/IL24 on bone metastasis resulted from prostate cancer-selective killing and inhibition of osteoclast differentiation, which is necessary for bone resorption. Gain- and loss-of-function genetic approaches document that prosurvival Akt and Mcl-1 pathways are critically important in the antibone metastatic activity of MDA-7/IL24. Our previous findings showed that MDA-7/IL24 gene therapy plus Mcl-1 inhibitors cooperate synergistically. Similarly, an Mcl-1 small-molecule inhibitor synergized with MDA-7/IL24 and induced robust antibone metastatic activity. These results expand the potential applications of MDA-7/IL24 as an anticancer molecule and demonstrate that purified recombinant protein is nontoxic in preclinical animal models and has profound inhibitory effects on bone metastasis, which can be enhanced further when combined with an Mcl-1 inhibitory small molecule.

In addition to the classical paradigm in which AR exerts its biological effects in the nucleus by orchestrating the expression of the androgen-regulated transcriptome, there is considerable evidence supporting a rapid, nongenomic activity mediated by membrane-associated AR. Although the genomic action of AR has been studied in depth, the molecular events governing AR transport to the plasma membrane and the downstream AR signaling cascades remain poorly understood. In this study, we report that AR membrane transport is microtubule-dependent. Disruption of the function of kinesin 5B (KIF5B), but not of kinesin C3 (KIFC3), interfered with AR membrane association and signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays revealed that AR physically interacts with KIF5B and that androgen enhances this interaction. Furthermore, we show that heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is activated by membrane-associated AR and that HSP27 plays an important role in mediating AR-mediated membrane-to-nuclear signal transduction. Together, these results indicate that AR membrane translocation is mediated by the microtubule cytoskeleton and the motor protein KIF5B. By activating HSP27, membrane-associated AR potentiates the transcriptional activity of nuclear AR.

However, pain responses are rarely reported and often asked about by patients. Further, patients and their physicians are concerned about a lack of pain response portending a poor treatment response and may be inclined to change systemic therapies before completing 6 cycles. We evaluated the likelihood and time course of pain response, potential predictors of response, and its prognostic value in patients receiving radium-223.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the charts of patients who received radium-223 in our department. All patients were planned for 6 cycles with a prescribed dose of 50-55 kBq/kg at each administration. Pain scores, subjective response to pain, analgesic use, treatment toxicities, and laboratory values were recorded at each visit. Symptomatic skeletal events and survival were also recorded.  Results:   48 patients received at least one cycle of radium-223 and 27 (56%) received all 6 planned cycles. Median survival from first treatment was 16.0 months (95% CI 8.9 to 19.2 months). 33% experienced at least one symptomatic skeletal event during or after treatment. 62.5% of men reported a decrease in pain from pre-treatment baseline. Of men with improved pain, 96% experienced an improvement before the third cycle. Pain relief was not associated with a decrease in ALK-P or PSA or improved survival.  Conclusions:   Approximately two-thirds of patients who undergo treatment with radium-223 will experience an improvement in pain and, if it occurs, it will most likely occur within the first two cycles. Patients should be counseled about this timeline and, if pain improvement isn't achieved, palliative radiation and oral analgesic readjustment should be considered.

We compared performance of DWI for detection of prostate cancer (PCa) in peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) of prostate.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed data of 460 subjects who underwent preoperative 3.0-Tesla mpMRI and subsequently radical prostatectomy. Level of suspicion for PCa was graded using 5-grade Likert-scale from DWI. Topographic analyses were performed for location of tumor foci at each surgical specimen. Among those with DWI grade ≥ III, we analyzed concordance rate on the location of radiologic and pathologic index lesions between DWI and surgical specimens.  Results:   Among 460 patients, 351 (76.3%) patients showed suspicious DWI lesions (57.5% in PZ, 42.5% in TZ). Multivariates regression analyses revealed significant associations between high DWI grade and adverse pathologic outcomes including pathologic stage, Gleason score, tumor volume and extracapsular extension (all p < 0.05). Overall concordance rates between DWI and surgical specimen were 75.8%, significantly higher in PZ than TZ (82.2% vs. 67.1% p = 0.002). Such concordance rate showed a positive linear association with increase in DWI grading (p < 0.001). Among 109 patients with DWI grade I-II, 28 (25.7%) harbored high grade disease (pathologic Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3).  Conclusions:   DWI detects tumors in PZ of prostate more accurately than those in TZ. Such accuracy of DWI was shown to be more evident with higher DWI grade.

An emerging field of research describes the role of preoperative strategies to improve treatment tolerance and overall physical and psychological recovery.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of a multimodal prehabilitation intervention for men and their partners before RP for localized PCa.  Methods:   Thirty-four patients who opted for RP for localized PCa and their partners (19) were identified and recruited into the study. The multimodal intervention was composed of educational materials, physiotherapy instruction, and a self-management group-based seminar.  Results:   The multimodal prehabilitation intervention was perceived as overall helpful with demonstrated acceptability (91.9%). Beneficial themes related to the quality of the information provided to support self-management, open forum questions with multidisciplinary healthcare professionals, and increased knowledge among partners to help with their understanding of how to look after their partners.  Conclusion:   The intervention was feasible and beneficial for the PCa dyad. A future pilot randomized controlled trial study is needed to provide sufficient evidence on the long-term physical and psychological outcomes and cost-effectiveness.  Implications for practice:   Oncology nurses play a key role in the development of prehabilitation care delivery.

The purpose of this study was to explore the experience of transition to unsupervised, community-based exercise among men who had participated in a hospital-based supervised exercise programme in order to propose components that supported transition to unsupervised exercise.  Methods:   Participants were selected by means of purposive, criteria-based sampling. Men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy who had completed a 12-week hospital-based, supervised, group exercise intervention were invited to participate. The programme involved aerobic and resistance training using machines and included a structured transition to a community-based fitness centre. Data were collected by means of semi-structured focus group interviews and analysed using thematic analysis.  Results:   Five focus group interviews were conducted with a total of 29 men, of whom 25 reported to have continued to exercise at community-based facilities. Three thematic categories emerged: Development and practice of new skills; Establishing social relationships; and Familiarising with bodily well-being. These were combined into an overarching theme: From learning to doing. Components suggested to support transition were as follows: a structured transition involving supervised exercise sessions at a community-based facility; strategies to facilitate peer support; transferable tools including an individual exercise chart; and access to 'check-ups' by qualified exercise specialists.  Conclusions:   Hospital-based, supervised exercise provides a safe learning environment. Transferring to community-based exercise can be experienced as a confrontation with the real world and can be eased through securing a structured transition, having transferable tools, sustained peer support and monitoring.""","""['Mette L K Schmidt', 'Peter Østergren', 'Prue Cormie', 'Anne-Mette Ragle', 'Jens Sønksen', 'Julie Midtgaard']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Group-based exercise in daily clinical practice to improve physical fitness in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy: study protocol.', 'Experiences of participation in supervised group exercise among pregnant women with depression or low psychological well-being: A qualitative descriptive study.', 'A multi-centre investigation of delivering national guidelines on exercise training for men with advanced prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy in the UK NHS.', 'Effects of exercise on treatment-related adverse effects for patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: a systematic review.', 'Exercise medicine for the management of androgen deprivation therapy-related side effects in prostate cancer.', 'Determinants of exercise adherence and maintenance for cancer survivors: Implementation of a community-based group exercise program.

Objective:   To investigate the safety and T-suppressive effect of E4 in healthy men.  Design:   Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study.  Setting:   The study was conducted at a phase I clinical unit (QPS, Netherlands).  Participants:   Healthy male volunteers aged 40 to 70 years.

Main outcome measures:   Subjective side effects, pharmacodynamic effects on hemostatic variables, lipids, glucose, bone parameters, and endocrine parameters related to T metabolism.  Results:   Total and free T decreased dose-dependently and significantly. Nipple tenderness occurred in 40% and decrease of libido occurred in 30% of E4-treated men. The unwanted estrogenic effects on hemostasis were small, dose dependent, and in some cases significant. Lipid and bone parameters showed a favorable trend.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed clinical outcomes at our institution of 450 patients who received radical prostatectomy. Multiple surgeons were involved in the three approaches, and a single pathologist conducted the histopathological diagnoses. Positive surgical margin rates and locations among the three approaches were statistically assessed, and the risk factors of positive surgical margin were analyzed.  Results:   This study included 127, 136 and 187 patients in the open radical prostatectomy, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy groups, respectively. The positive surgical margin rates were 27.6% (open radical prostatectomy), 18.4% (laparoscopic radical prostatectomy) and 13.4% (robot-assisted radical prostatectomy). In propensity score-matched analyses, the positive surgical margin rate in the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was significantly lower than that in the open radical prostatectomy, whereas there was no significant difference in the positive surgical margin rates between robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. In the multivariable analysis, PSA level at diagnosis and surgical approach (open radical prostatectomy vs robot-assisted radical prostatectomy) were independent risk factors for positive surgical margin. The apex was the most common location of positive surgical margin in the open radical prostatectomy and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy groups, whereas the bladder neck was the most common location in the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy group. The significant difference of positive surgical margin locations continued after the propensity score adjustment.  Conclusions:   Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy may potentially achieve the lowest positive surgical margin rate among three surgical approaches. The bladder neck was the most common location of positive surgical margin in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and apex in open radical prostatectomy and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.

Postoperative SUI distribution was mild in 2 (10%), moderate in one (5%) and severe in 2 (10%). Satisfaction rate was 80%, equal for transurethral resection of the prostate with/without previous radiotherapy. No patient had urinary retention after catheter removal. Complications presented in 3 (15%) patients, all minor. After median 38.5mo follow-up no system has been removed, 19 (95%) self-considered better than before and 11 (55%) very much better.  Conclusion:   Based on short-term efficacy and patient satisfaction ATOMS® can be considered a realistic alternative for SUI after transurethral resection of the prostate, even after irradiation. Absence of urethral erosion and very limited problems make this alternative especially attractive for cases with diminished dexterity, advanced age and previous failed treatments.""","""['J C Angulo', 'J Fonseca', 'C Esquinas', 'A Ojea', 'A Rodríguez', 'M Rabassa', 'F Teba', 'G Escribano', 'F Cruz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Adjustable Transobturator Male System after Failed Surgical Devices for Male Stress Urinary Incontinence: A Feasibility Study.', 'Treatment of stress urinary incontinence after prostatectomy with the adjustable transobturator male system (ATOMS®) with preattached scrotal port.', 'The Adjustable Transobturator Male System in Stress Urinary Incontinence After Transurethral Resection of the Prostate.', 'Sling Surgery for the Treatment of Urinary Incontinence After Transurethral Resection of the Prostate: New Data on the Virtue Male Sling and an Evaluation of Literature.', 'Update on Adjustable Trans-Obturator Male System (ATOMS) for Male Incontinence after Prostate Cancer Surgery.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis comparing Adjustable Transobturator Male System (ATOMS) and male Readjustment Mechanical External (REMEEX) system for post-prostatectomy incontinence.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis comparing Adjustable Transobturator Male System (ATOMS) and Adjustable Continence Therapy (ProACT) for male stress incontinence.', 'Effectiveness of Adjustable Transobturator Male System (ATOMS) to Treat Male Stress Incontinence: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Group interventions showed benefits to emotional distress and fatigue, but most of these studies focus on breast cancer patients. However, it is important to test if an effective intervention for breast cancer patients could also have benefits for prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Our controlled study aimed to compare the efficacy of a self-hypnosis/self-care group intervention to improve emotional distress, sleep difficulties, fatigue and quality of life of breast and prostate cancer patients. 25 men with prostate cancer and 68 women with breast cancer participated and were evaluated before (T0) and after (T1) the intervention.  Results:   After the intervention, the breast cancer group showed positive effects for anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep difficulties, and global health status, whereas there was no effect in the prostate cancer group. We showed that women suffered from higher difficulties prior to the intervention and that their oncological treatments were different in comparison to men.  Conclusion:   The differences in the efficacy of the intervention could be explained by the baseline differences. As men in our sample reported few distress, fatigue or sleep problems, it is likely that they did not improve on these dimensions.

Molecular studies have shown that PCa can be classified according to their genomic alterations but none of the published PCa molecular classifications could identify a subtype corresponding to non-evolutive tumours.  Materials and methods:   Multi-omics molecular profiling was carried out on post-radical prostatectomy material from a cohort of 130 patients with localized PCa. We used unsupervised classification techniques to build a comprehensive classification of prostate tumours based on three molecular levels: DNA copy number, DNA methylation, and mRNA expression. Merged data from our cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort were used to characterize the resulting tumour subtypes. We measured subtype-associated risks of biochemical relapse using Cox regression models and survival data from five cohorts including the two aforementioned.  Results:   We describe three PCa molecular subtypes associated with specific molecular characteristics and different clinical outcomes. Particularly, one subtype was strongly associated with the absence of biochemical recurrence. We validated this finding on 746 samples from 5 distinct cohorts (P = 3.41 × 10-8, N = 746 tumour samples), and showed that our subtyping approach outperformed the most popular prognostic molecular signatures to accurately identify a subset of patients with a non-evolutive disease. We provide a set of 36 transcriptomic biomarkers to robustly identify this subtype of non-evolutive cases whose prevalence was estimated to 22% of all localized PCa tumours.  Conclusion:   At least 20% of patients with localized PCa can be accurately predicted to have a non-evolutive disease on the basis of their molecular subtype. Those patients should not undergo immediate surgery and rather be placed under active surveillance.""","""['A Kamoun', 'G Cancel-Tassin', 'G Fromont', 'N Elarouci', 'L Armenoult', 'M Ayadi', 'J Irani', 'X Leroy', 'A Villers', 'G Fournier', 'L Doucet', 'S Boyault', 'L Brureau', 'L Multigner', 'A Diedhiou', 'M Roupret', 'E Compérat', 'P Blanchet', 'A de Reyniès', 'O Cussenot']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Ann Oncol""","""['A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'A Biopsy-based 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score as a Predictor of Metastases and Prostate Cancer Death in Surgically Treated Men with Clinically Localized Disease.', 'A 17-Gene Genomic Prostate Score as a Predictor of Adverse Pathology in Men on Active Surveillance.', 'Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'A machine learning framework develops a DNA replication stress model for predicting clinical outcomes and therapeutic vulnerability in primary prostate cancer.', 'Translational Bioinformatics for Human Reproductive Biology Research: Examples, Opportunities and Challenges for a Future Reproductive Medicine.', 'Multi-omics subtyping of hepatocellular carcinoma patients using a Bayesian network mixture model.', 'Prostate cancer in omics era.', 'African-specific molecular taxonomy of prostate cancer.']"""

From 2005 to 2018, we identified 29 cases from our consult service and 1 case from our own institution. Men ranged in age from 39 to 90 years (median=75.5). Diagnostic specimens consisted of needle biopsies (n=13); transurethral resections (n=7), urethral/bladder biopsies (n=8), radical prostatectomy (n=1), and orchiectomy (n=1). In all cases, there was usual acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma, where the highest grade in all cases was Gleason score 9 to 10 (Grade Group 5). On average, 68% of the involved cores had cancer with a maximum percent of cancer averaging 55%; on average, transurethral resections had 85% of the area involved by cancer. Areas of cancer showing pleomorphic giant cell features were focal (<5%). Two of the needle biopsies showed extraprostatic extension. The radical prostatectomy had seminal vesicle invasion and positive margins with lymphovascular invasion. Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal pleomorphic giant cell features is always accompanied by extensive usual acinar prostate adenocarcinoma where the highest grade in all cases was Gleason score 9 to 10 (Grade Group 5). Although the pleomorphic component is focal, it can mimic urothelial carcinoma. IHC can be misleading as PSA staining is often negative or focal in both the pleomorphic and usual prostatic adenocarcinoma components. NKX3.1 is the most sensitive prostate marker, but was still focal in 1 usual prostatic adenocarcinoma and negative in 2 pleomorphic components. Prostatic adenocarcinoma with focal pleomorphic giant cell features has a dismal prognosis. In men with no prior diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma and >1-year follow-up, 7/19 (37%) were dead at a median of 8 months after diagnosis.

Those stem-like prostate cancer cells show high expression of ABCB1, which encodes multidrug resistance-related protein P-glycoprotein, leading to the Doc-resistance in prostate cancer. Moreover, we found that Notch signaling pathway activation in Doc-resistant cell lines and tumor tissues of patients with HRPC correlated with tumorigenicity and the development of Doc resistance.

Patients and methods:   The Cryo On-Line Data (COLD) registry was queried for men undergoing primary whole-gland cryotherapy between 1990 and 2014 who developed a RUF. Patient factors and disease parameters were correlated with RUF using chi-square and the t-test. Variables with p < 0.25 were entered into a binary logistic regression with stepwise backward elimination to determine the factors associated with RUF formation.  Results:   A total of 4102 men underwent primary whole-gland cryotherapy in the COLD registry at the time of analysis. Postoperative RUF was documented in 50 out of 4102 cases (1.2%). Patients with RUF had similar demographic data, prostate volume, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, and clinical stage in comparison to those without fistula. On both univariate and multivariate analyses, postoperative urinary retention (odds ratio [OR]: 6.30; confidence interval [95% CI] 3.43-11.58, p < 0.001), preoperative Gleason score of ≥7 (OR: 1.92; 95% CI 1.08-3.43, p = 0.027), and preoperative incontinence (OR: 2.95; 95% CI 1.12-7.76, p = 0.028) were the most significant risk factors associated with RUF formation.

DC capture antigens and move to the lymphoid organs where they prime naive T cells. Interaction between DC and T cells are most active in lymph nodes and suppression of DC trafficking to lymph nodes impairs the immune response. In this work, we aimed to study trafficking of DC in vivo via various routes of delivery, to optimize the effectiveness of DC-based therapy. A DC labeling system was developed using 1,1'-dioctadecyltetramethyl indotricarbocyanine Iodine for in vivo fluorescent imaging. DC harvested from C57B/6 mice were matured, labeled, and injected intravenously, subcutaneously, or intratumorally, with or without antigen loading with whole tumor lysate, into C57B/6 mice inoculated with RM-1 murine prostate tumor cells. Signal intensity was measured in vivo and ex vivo. Signal intensity at the tumor site increased over time, suggesting trafficking of DC to the tumor with all modes of injection. Subcutaneous injection showed preferential trafficking to lymph nodes and tumor. Intravenous injection showed trafficking to lungs, intestines, and spleen. Subcutaneous injection of DC pulsed with whole tumor lysate resulted in the highest increase in signal intensity at the tumor site and lymph nodes, suggesting subcutaneous injection of primed DC leads to highest preferential trafficking of DC to the immunocompetent organs.""","""['Sarah C Krzastek', 'Ekaterine Goliadze', 'Shaoqing Zhou', 'Albert Petrossian', 'Fatma Youniss', 'Gobalakrishnan Sundaresan', 'Li Wang', 'Jamal Zweit', 'Georgi Guruli']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['CD40ligand-expressing dendritic cells induce regression of hepatocellular carcinoma by activating innate and acquired immunity in vivo.', 'Synergistic combination of murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells loaded ex vivo with whole tumor lysate and systemic chemotherapy mediates antitumor immune responses in vivo.', 'Sarcosine promotes trafficking of dendritic cells and improves efficacy of anti-tumor dendritic cell vaccines via CXC chemokine family signaling.', 'Migration of dendritic cells to the lymph nodes and its enhancement to drive anti-tumor responses.', 'Control of dendritic cell migration by chemokines.', 'The tumor stroma influences immune cell distribution and recruitment in a PDAC-on-a-chip model.', 'A Microfluidic 3D Endothelium-on-a-Chip Model to Study Transendothelial Migration of T Cells in Health and Disease.', 'AIM2 regulates anti-tumor immunity and is a viable therapeutic target for melanoma.', 'Trial watch: dendritic cell vaccination for cancer immunotherapy.', 'A Mathematical Modelling of Initiation of Dendritic Cells-Induced T Cell Immune Response.']"""

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of obesity on PSA and the potential contributing mechanisms. A cohort of 1195 men aged 35 years and over at recruitment, with demographic, anthropometric (BMI, waist circumference (WC)) and serum hormone (serum testosterone, estradiol (E2)) PSA and hematology assessments obtained over two waves was assessed. Men with a history of prostate cancer or missing PSA were excluded, leaving 970 men for the final analysis. Mixed-effects regressions and mediation analyses adjusting for hormonal and volumetric factors explore the potential mechanisms relating obesity to PSA. After adjusting for age, PSA levels were lower in men with greater WC (P = 0.001). In a multivariable model including WC, age, E2/testosterone and PlasV as predictors, no statistically significant associations were observed between with PSA and either WC (P = 0.36) or PlasV (P = 0.49), while strong associations were observed with both E2/testosterone (P < 0.001) and age (P < 0.001). In the mediation analyses with PlasV as the mediator, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) explained roughly 20% of the total effect of WC on PSA (P = 0.31), while when E2/testosterone is a mediator, the ACME explained roughly 50% of the effect (P < 0.001). Our findings indicate that lower PSA levels in obese men, as compared to normal weight men, can be explained both by hormonal changes (elevated E2/testosterone ratio) and hemodilution. Hormonal factors therefore represent a substantial but underappreciated mediating pathway.""","""['Adel T Aref', 'Andrew D Vincent', ""Michael E O'Callaghan"", 'Sean A Martin', 'Peter D Sutherland', 'Andrew J Hoy', 'Lisa M Butler', 'Gary A Wittert']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Association of Obesity-Related Hemodilution of Prostate-Specific Antigen, Dihydrotestosterone, and Testosterone.', 'Obesity inversely correlates with prostate-specific antigen levels in a population with normal screening results of prostate cancer in northwestern China.', 'Serum prostate-specific antigen hemodilution among obese men undergoing screening in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Which obesity index best correlates with prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen, and lower urinary tract symptoms?', 'Obesity-related plasma hemodilution and PSA concentration among men with prostate cancer.', 'Hot Spots and Trends in the Relationship between Cancer and Obesity: A Systematic Review and Knowledge Graph Analysis.', 'Development and validation of a multi-parameter nomogram for predicting prostate cancer: a retrospective analysis from Handan Central Hospital in China.', 'Association between serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations and the risk of developing type\xa02 diabetes mellitus in Chinese men: A cohort study.', 'PSA and obesity among men with localized prostate cancer: results of the ANDROCAN study.', 'Obesity at Diagnosis and Prostate Cancer Prognosis and Recurrence Risk Following Primary Treatment by Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Septic complications are a major health issue.  Objective:   To evaluate complication rates with or without an antimicrobial lubricant.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 1000 patients received pbx between 2013 and 2015. Information about complications was collected by a 3-wk questionnaire. Return rate was 73.2% (n=732).  Intervention:   Randomization for pbx with the instillation of an antimicrobial lubricant (intervention group, n=385) or the standard lubricant (control group, n=347) was performed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable analyses assessed the association between infectious complications at biopsy and use of an antimicrobial lubricant, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), history of urogenitourinary infections, and several other confounders.  Results and limitations:   The use of an antimicrobial lubricant did not reduce infection rate. Overall complication rate was very low. Of all patients, 69.3% described the procedure as pain free. Fever ≥38.5°C was reported in overall 1.9% of patients. Urinary retention with catheterization occurred in 3.1%. Most common complications were hematospermia (47.4%), macrohematuria (23.8%), and rectal bleeding (7.4%). Readmission rate was 1% (n=7). In multivariable analyses, IPSS and previous infectious complications were associated with a higher risk of infectious complications. Our results stem from a large German single center and therefore are limited to this patient group.  Conclusions:   No significant reduction was shown in infectious complications in the intervention group with the antimicrobial agent. Low incidence of those complications may be the underlying cause. Severe morbidity at pbx is uncommon. Specifically, the rate of infection was very low.  Patient summary:   Severe complications at prostate biopsy are rare. Among participants, 69.3% had no pain. Fever was rare (1.9% of patients). Voiding issues with catheterization occurred in 3.1%. Most common complications were blood in the semen (47.4%), urine (23.8%), or stool (7.4%).

Objective:   To systematically explore the genomic complexity of tumor cells with different Gleason scores (GSs) in PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed single-cell whole genome sequencing of 17 tumor cells from localized lesions with distinct GS and matched four normal samples from two prostatectomy patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   All classes of genomic alterations were identified, including substitutions, insertions/deletions, copy number alterations, and rearrangements.  Results and limitations:   Significant spatial, intra- and intertumoral heterogeneities were observed at the cellular level. In the patient 1, all cells shared the same TP53 driver mutation, implying a monoclonal origin of PCa. In the patient 2, only a subpopulation of cells contained the TP53 driver mutation, whereas other cells carried different driver mutations, indicating a typical polyclonal model with separate clonal cell expansions. The tumor cells from different sides of prostate owned various mutation patterns. Considerable neoantigens were predicted among different cells, implying unknown immune editing components helping prostate tumor cells escaping from immune surveillance.  Conclusions:   There is a significant spatial genomic heterogeneity even in the same PCa patient. Our study also provides the first genome-wide evidence at single-cell level, supporting that the origin of PCa could be either polyclonal or monoclonal, which has implications for treatment decisions for prostate cancer.

We have estimated the delivered dose in a dose-escalation trial of locally advanced prostate cancer by statistical dose-accumulation and by DVH-summation, and compared to planned dose.  Materials and method:   Prescribed dose-escalation to the prostate was 67.5 Gy/25fr., corresponding to 81GyEQD2 assuming α/β = 1.5. The 21 patients had three targets (i.e. CTV67.5 + 2 mm, CTV60 + 5 mm, CTV50 + 10 mm) irradiated by a simultaneous-integrated-boost technique. Analysis was based on 213 CT scans and 5-years of follow-up. For statistical dose-accumulation, we modelled 10000 possible treatment courses based on planned dose and deformation-vector-fields from contour-based registration. For DVH-summation we recalculated dose on repeat-CTs and estimated median D98%/EUD. Groups with/without disease recurrence were compared.  Results:   Discrepancies between planned and accumulated dose were mostly seen for CTV67.5, where under-dosage was found at different locations in the prostate in 12/21 patients. Delivered dose-escalation (D98%) was on average 73.9GyEQD2 (range: 68.3-78.7GyEQD2). No significant difference in accumulated-D98% was found in patients with (n = 8) and without (n = 13) recurrence (p > 0.05). Average D98%/EUD with statistical dose-accumulation vs DVH-summation was significantly different in CTV60, CTV50, rectum and bladder but not in CTV67.5.  Conclusion:   The planned dose escalation was not received by more than half-of-the patients. Robustness of the prostate target (CTV67.5) should therefore be better prioritized in these patients given the low toxicity profile.

In particular, leucine and glutamine have been shown to be important for growth and proliferation of some breast cancers, and therefore targeting the primary cell-surface transporters that mediate their uptake, L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) and alanine, serine, cysteine-preferring transporter 2 (ASCT2), is a potential therapeutic strategy.  Methods:   The ASCT2 inhibitor, benzylserine (BenSer), is also able to block LAT1 activity, thus inhibiting both leucine and glutamine uptake. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of BenSer in breast cancer cell lines to determine whether combined LAT1 and ASCT2 inhibition could inhibit cell growth and proliferation.  Results:   BenSer treatment significantly inhibited both leucine and glutamine uptake in MCF-7, HCC1806 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, causing decreased cell viability and cell cycle progression. These effects were not primarily leucine-mediated, as BenSer was more cytostatic than the LAT family inhibitor, BCH. Oocyte uptake assays with ectopically expressed amino acid transporters identified four additional targets of BenSer, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis of intracellular amino acid concentrations revealed that this BenSer-mediated inhibition of amino acid uptake was sufficient to disrupt multiple pathways of amino acid metabolism, causing reduced lactate production and activation of an amino acid response (AAR) through activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4).  Conclusions:   Together these data showed that BenSer blockade inhibited breast cancer cell growth and viability through disruption of intracellular amino acid homeostasis and inhibition of downstream metabolic and growth pathways.""","""['Michelle van Geldermalsen', 'Lake-Ee Quek', 'Nigel Turner', 'Natasha Freidman', 'Angel Pang', 'Yi Fang Guan', 'James R Krycer', 'Renae Ryan', 'Qian Wang', 'Jeff Holst']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Targeting glutamine transport to suppress melanoma cell growth.', 'Targeting of glutamine transporter ASCT2 and glutamine synthetase suppresses gastric cancer cell growth.', 'ASCT2/SLC1A5 controls glutamine uptake and tumour growth in triple-negative basal-like breast cancer.', 'Glutamine metabolism in breast cancer and possible therapeutic targets.', 'The Regulation and Function of the L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 (LAT1) in Cancer.', 'Glutaminolysis and peripheral CD4+ T cell differentiation: from mechanism to intervention strategy.', 'Targeting glutamine metabolism as a therapeutic strategy for cancer.', 'Impact of the polymer backbone chemistry on interactions of amino-acid-derived zwitterionic polymers with cells.', 'Potential Therapies Targeting the Metabolic Reprogramming of Diabetes-Associated Breast Cancer.', 'Overview of Cancer Metabolism and Signaling Transduction.']"""

The idea that differences in gene expression ranking are associated with presence or absence of disease is compelling and has strong biological plausibility. Nevertheless, the TSP formulation ignores significant available information which can improve classification accuracy and is vulnerable to selecting genes which do not have differential expression in the two conditions (""pivot"" genes).  Results:   We introduce the AUCTSP classifier as an alternative rank-based estimator of the magnitude of the ranking reversals involved in the original TSP. The proposed estimator is based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) and as such, takes into account the separation of the entire distribution of gene expression levels in gene pairs under the conditions considered, as opposed to comparing gene rankings within individual subjects as in the original TSP formulation. Through extensive simulations and case studies involving classification in ovarian, leukemia, colon, breast and prostate cancers and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, we show the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of improving classification accuracy, avoiding overfitting and being less prone to selecting non-informative (pivot) genes.  Conclusions:   The proposed AUCTSP is a simple yet reliable and robust rank-based classifier for gene expression classification. While the AUCTSP works by the same principle as TSP, its ability to determine the top scoring gene pair based on the relative rankings of two marker genes across all subjects as opposed to each individual subject results in significant performance gains in classification accuracy. In addition, the proposed method tends to avoid selection of non-informative (pivot) genes as members of the top-scoring pair.""","""['Dimitri Kagaris', 'Alireza Khamesipour', 'Constantin T Yiannoutsos']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Speeding up the discovery of combinations of differentially expressed genes for disease prediction and classification.', 'TSG: a new algorithm for binary and multi-class cancer classification and informative genes selection.', 'Tumor classification ranking from microarray data.', 'A generalized covariate-adjusted top-scoring pair algorithm with applications to diabetic kidney disease stage classification in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study.', 'Relative expression analysis for molecular cancer diagnosis and prognosis.', 'Data analysis methods for defining biomarkers from omics data.', 'Modeling Between-Study Heterogeneity for Improved Replicability in Gene Signature Selection and Clinical Prediction.', 'A qualitative transcriptional signature for predicting microsatellite instability status of right-sided Colon Cancer.']"""

Overexpression of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) enzyme and high activity of its metabolic pathway is reported to be a driver for prostate cancer malignancy. Farnesyloxycoumarin derivatives (3f, 4f and 7f) inhibit lipoxygenase enzyme. We hypothesized that farnesyloxycoumarins may exert an anti-cancer effect on prostate cancer cells due to their 15-LOX-1 inhibitory potential.  Methods:   The enzyme inhibitory activity of 3f, 4f and 7f was initially evaluated on PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. MTT assay was performed on cancer cell lines and HFF3 cell line to assess cytotoxicity of the compounds. The apoptotic morphology of cells after treatments was assessed by DAPI staining and single cell gel electrophoresis. Propidium iodide staining was also performed to detect cell cycle variations after treatment.  Results:   7f inhibited 15-LOX-1 at IC50=4.3 µg/mL, while 3f and 4f did not show high inhibitory activity. 7f reduced cell viability in PC-3 cells at IC50=22-31 µg/mL, however, no significant cytotoxicity was revealed on normal cells. DAPI staining and comet assay confirmed apoptosis and DNA damage in PC-3 cells after 7f treatment, while flow cytometry results revealed G1 arrest in PC-3 cells.  Conclusion:   The results are indicative of a distinctive cytotoxic mechanism for 7f compared to other coumarins, possibly due to its 15-LOX-1 inhibitory potential.

The Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were applied to examine the cumulative incidence of artificial urinary sphincter reimplantation and revision/removal, and identify risk factors, respectively.  Results:   A total of 1,632 male patients underwent initial implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter. The 10-year revision/removal and reimplantation rates were 34% and 27%, respectively. There was no difference between high and low volume hospitals or between community and academic hospitals in terms of revision/removal.

We report patient related outcome measures and adverse events in men in the PICTURE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01492270) who underwent this diagnostic test.  Materials and methods:   A total of 249 men underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging followed by transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy as a validation study. Functional outcomes before and after transperineal template prostate mapping were prospectively collected and recorded with questionnaires, including the I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score), the I-PSS-QoL (Quality of Life), the IIEF-15 (International Index of Erectile Function-15) and the EPIC (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) urinary function.  Results:   Mean age was 62 years, median prostate specific antigen was 6.8 ng/ml and median gland size was 37 ml. At transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy a median of 49 cores (IQR 40-55) were taken. Mean time to complete the post-procedure patient related outcome measure questionnaires was 46 days. Adverse events included post-procedure acute urinary retention in 24% of patients, rectal pain in 26% and perineal pain in 41%. Transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy resulted in a statistically significant increase in scores on the I-PSS from 10.9 to 11.8 (p = 0.024) and the I-PSS-QoL from 1.57 to 1.76 (p = 0.03). The IIEF-15 erectile function score decreased by 23.2% from 47.7 to 38.7 (p <0.001). Significant deterioration was noted in all 5 of IIEF-15 functional domains, including erectile and orgasmic function, sexual desire, and intercourse and overall satisfaction (p <0.001). EPIC urinary scores showed no overall change from baseline.  Conclusions:   Transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy causes a high urinary retention rate and a detrimental impact on genitourinary functional outcomes, including deterioration in urinary flow and sexual function. Our findings can be used to ensure adequate counseling about transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies.

We compared registration errors (the distance between a region of interest and fiducial markers) between rigid and elastic registration during fusion guided prostate biopsy using a prostate phantom model.  Materials and methods:   Four gold fiducial markers visible on magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound were placed throughout 1 phantom prostate model. The phantom underwent magnetic resonance imaging and the fiducial markers were labeled as regions of interest. An experienced user and a novice user of fusion guided prostate biopsy targeted regions of interest and then the corresponding fiducial markers on ultrasound after rigid and then elastic registration. Registration errors were compared.  Results:   A total of 224 registration error measurements were recorded. Overall elastic registration did not provide significantly improved registration error over rigid registration (mean ± SD 4.87 ± 3.50 vs 4.11 ± 2.09 mm, p = 0.05). However, lesions near the edge of the phantom showed increased registration errors when using elastic registration (5.70 ± 3.43 vs 3.23 ± 1.68 mm, p = 0.03). Compared to the novice user the experienced user reported decreased registration error with rigid registration (3.25 ± 1.49 vs 4.98 ± 2.10 mm, p <0.01) and elastic registration (3.94 ± 2.61 vs 6.07 ± 4.16 mm, p <0.01).  Conclusions:   We found no difference in registration errors between rigid and elastic registration overall but rigid registration decreased the registration error of targets near the prostate edge. Additionally, operator experience reduced registration errors regardless of the registration method. Therefore, elastic registration algorithms cannot serve as a replacement for attention to detail during the registration process and anatomical landmarks indicating accurate registration when beginning the procedure and before targeting each region of interest.""","""['Graham R Hale', 'Marcin Czarniecki', 'Alexis Cheng', 'Jonathan B Bloom', 'Reza Seifabadi', 'Samuel A Gold', 'Kareem N Rayn', 'Vikram K Sabarwal', 'Sherif Mehralivand', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Brad Wood', 'Peter A Pinto']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', '3-Dimensional elastic registration system of prostate biopsy location by real-time 3-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guidance with magnetic resonance/transrectal ultrasound image fusion.', 'Elastic Versus Rigid Image Registration in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Prostate Biopsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Precision of MRI/ultrasound-fusion biopsy in prostate cancer diagnosis: an ex vivo comparison of alternative biopsy techniques on prostate phantoms.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy of the Prostate-An Update.', 'Multiparametric ultrasound of prostate: role in prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Biomechanical modelling of the pelvic system: improving the accuracy of the location of neoplasms in MRI-TRUS fusion prostate biopsy.', ""Impact of Surgeon's Experience in Rigid versus Elastic MRI/TRUS-Fusion Biopsy to Detect Significant Prostate Cancer Using Targeted and Systematic Cores."", 'High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) Focal Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer with MRI-US Fusion Platform.', 'Usability and diagnostic accuracy of different MRI/ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy systems for the detection of clinically significant and insignificant prostate cancer: a prospective cohort study.']"""

Using logistic regression analysis, education, marital status, satisfaction with life, satisfaction with health, history of diabetes and of hypertension, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and physical activity were examined as potential LUTS risk factors adjusting for age.  Results:   Increase in BMI between baseline and FUP4 of ≥ 2 BMI units was related to LUTS progression (odds ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.57) compared with stable BMI.

TB has emerged to complement systematic template biopsy (SB) in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis; however, which magnetic resonance imaging targeting methodology is diagnostically better remains unclear.  Materials and methods:   A total of 510 patients underwent TB at our institution before and after the adoption of fusion software with the UroNav platform (Invivo Corporation, Gainsville, FL). All patients had concurrent 12-core SB. We compared rates of clinically significant PCa detection, and rates of upstaging and missed diagnosis in reference to SB among patients who received COG-TB and patients who received FUS-TB. We also compared both COG-TB and FUS-TB results to their paired SB results.  Results:   The rates of upstaging or missing clinically significant PCa with FUS-TB (in reference to SB) was not significantly different from COG-TB (P = 0.172), nor was the risk of missing clinically significant PCa different between FUS-TB vs COG-TB on logistic regression ( Odds ratio = 0.55, P = 0.106). No significant difference in biopsy outcomes was observed between FUS-TB and COG-TB (P = 0.171). We did find significant differences between FUS-TB and SB and between COG-TB and SB, with SB finding more clinically insignificant PCa (P < 0.001 and P = 0.04).  Conclusion:   In our institutional experience, no significant difference was observed between the diagnostic ability of COG-TB vs FUS-TB for detecting clinically significant PCa.

Previously we reported that specific PPRHs against the antiapoptotic gene survivin were able to decrease viability of PC3 prostate cancer cells by increasing apoptosis, while not acting on HUVEC non-tumoral cells. These PPRHs were efficient both in vitro and in vivo. In the present work, we performed a functional pharmacogenomics study on the effects of specific and unspecific hairpins against survivin. Incubation of PC3 cells with the specific HpsPr-C-WT led to 244 differentially expressed genes when applying the p < 0.05, FC > 2, Benjamini-Hochberg filtering. Importantly, the unspecific or control Hp-WC did not originate differentially expressed genes using the same settings. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that the differentially expressed genes clustered very significantly within the gene sets of Regulation of cell proliferation, Cellular response to stress, Apoptosis and Prostate cancer. Network analyses using STRING identified important interacting gene-nodes within the response of PC3 cells to treatment with the PPRH against survivin, mainly POLR2G, PAK1IP1, SMC3, SF3A1, PPARGC1A, NCOA6, UGT2B7, ALG5, VAMP7 and HIST1H2BE, the former six present in the Gene Sets detected in the GSEA. Additionally, HepG2 and 786-O cell lines were used to carry out in vitro experiments of hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, respectively.

Methods:   We used three different PCA cases to assess the three information tools. Construct validation was performed using two healthcare groups with different levels of expertise: (1) Nine expert urologists in PCA, and (2) nine medical students. After each information tool, the study participants plotted the tumor location in a 2-dimensional prostate diagram. A scoring system was established to evaluate the drawings in terms of accuracy of plotting tumor position. Data are shown as median scores with interquartile range.  Results:   Within the expert group, no significant difference was seen in the overall scoring results between the information tools (p = 0.34). Medical students performed significantly worse with MDT information (p = 0.03). Experts performed better in all three information tools compared to students, resulting in a significantly 25% higher overall total score (25.0[22.3-26.7] vs. 20.0[15.0-24.0], p<0.001). The difference was largest after MDT information, with experts showing a 49% better scoring (p<0.001), and second largest with the 3D printed models, showing a 17% better scoring of the experts (p = 0.07). No difference was found in the written MRI report scoring results between experts and students.  Conclusions:   3D printed models provided better orientation guide to medical students compared to MDT MRI presentations.

Cancer incidence data for the selected tumor sites were obtained from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database in order to estimate the potential medical need for carbon-ion RT. The carbon-ion RT adaption rate was assessed based on the clinical experience of other carbon-ion therapy facilities. An estimation model was constructed for estimating the medical need for carbon-ion RT, and from this, 25 606 patients were deemed to be potential candidates for carbon-ion RT. This estimated potential need corresponded to 10% of newly diagnosed cancer patients in Korea. The realistic estimation was calculated as ranging between 4000 and 6300 patients, depending on the carbon-ion RT adaptation rate. This estimated medical need corresponded to 2-3% of newly diagnosed cancer patients in Korea.

Enabling of extragonadal DHT synthesis by HSD3B1(1245C) predicts for more rapid clinical resistance to castration and sensitivity to extragonadal androgen synthesis inhibition. HSD3B1(1245C) thus appears to define a subgroup of patients who benefit from blocking extragonadal androgens. However, abiraterone, which is administered to block extragonadal androgens, is a steroidal drug that is metabolized by 3βHSD1 to multiple steroidal metabolites, including 3-keto-5α-abiraterone, which stimulates the androgen receptor. Our objective was to determine if HSD3B1(1245C) inheritance is associated with increased 3-keto-5α-abiraterone synthesis in patients.  Methods:   First, we characterized the pharmacokinetics of 7 steroidal abiraterone metabolites in 15 healthy volunteers. Second, we determined the association between serum 3-keto-5α-abiraterone levels and HSD3B1 genotype in 30 patients treated with abiraterone acetate (AA) after correcting for the determined pharmacokinetics.  Results:   Patients who inherit 0, 1, and 2 copies of HSD3B1(1245C) have a stepwise increase in normalized 3-keto-5α-abiraterone (0.04 ng/ml, 2.60 ng/ml, and 2.70 ng/ml, respectively; P = 0.002).  Conclusion:   Increased generation of 3-keto-5α-abiraterone in patients with HSD3B1(1245C) might partially negate abiraterone benefits in these patients who are otherwise more likely to benefit from CYP17A1 inhibition.

However, the relative ADC values between tumor lesions and normal tissue have been suggested as more suitable than the absolute ADC values for evaluation of diffusion abnormalities, because absolute ADC values are susceptible to differences in scanners or scanner settings. The present study evaluated the usefulness of the relative assessment of ADC values between tumor lesions and normal tissue on preoperative mpMRI for the prediction of high-risk prostate cancer on radical prostatectomy specimens.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis of 48 men who underwent radical prostatectomy between January 2013 and December 2014 was conducted. MpMRI was performed with a 3.0-T scanner using b-values of 0 and 1500 s/mm2. ADC values of the tumor (ADCTUMOR) and normal prostate and the relative ADC tumor/normal ratio (ADCTNR) were evaluated by two radiologists.  Results:   The inter-rater reliability between two radiologists for ADCTUMOR measurement was high, with Pearson's r = 0.982. There was no difference in ADCTUMOR between GS ≤7 and GS ≥8. In contrast, ADCTNR was significantly lower in GS ≥8 than in GS ≤7. ROC curves of ADCTNR to predict higher GS (≥8) showed better classification performance (AUC = 0.8243, p = .0012 by radiologist A and AUC = 0.7961, p = .0031 by radiologist B) than of ADCTUMOR.

In Canada, an aging male population, along with medical advances, has resulted in increasing numbers of working men being diagnosed with, and treated for, prostate cancer. Little is known about the linkages between men's work and their experiences of prostate cancer. In this qualitative study, 24 Western Canadian men were interviewed to distil the connections between work, prostate cancer screening, diagnosis, and the decision to undergo radical prostatectomy. Data were analyzed using constant comparison in the context of masculinities theory. The findings demonstrated that work was central to men's masculine identities and afforded financial security, social status, and a sense of personal growth. However, work-related strain and demands were also found to affect participants' health and distance them from their families. A diagnosis of prostate cancer tended to diminish the importance of work, wherein participants focused on optimizing their health and strengthening family relations. In deciding on radical prostatectomy as a treatment to eradicate prostate cancer, few men considered the implications for returning to work. The current study findings indicate that clinicians and patients should explicitly explore and discuss how surgery side effects may affect work and career plans during treatment decision-making.""","""['Wellam F Yu Ko', 'John L Oliffe', 'Joy L Johnson', 'Joan L Bottorff']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""[""Reformulating the Worker Identity: Men's Experiences After Radical Prostatectomy."", ""The influence of family ties on men's prostate cancer screening, biopsy, and treatment decisions."", ""Healthy Eating and Active Living: Rural-Based Working Men's Perspectives."", ""Men, food, and prostate cancer: gender influences on men's diets."", 'Prostate Cancer Treatment and Work: A Scoping Review.', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer: A systematic review update.']"""

Methods and materials:   A QM program was developed by a multidisciplinary team, using both an in-house risk-and-benefit balance impact template (RABBIT) tool and a failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA). FMEA scores were determined by three physicists, one radiation therapist and two radiation oncologists who were familiar with the protocol. The QM program produced by both risk-based techniques was then compared and consolidated.  Results:   The RABBIT tool identified 26 potential risks during the treatment planning and delivery process. During the FMEA, a total of 35 potential failure modes were identified from the seven major processes in ultrasound-based HDR pBT. For the 35 potential failure modes, risk priority number scores ranged from 14 to 267. The highest ranked failure mode was identified to be mislabeling/connection of the transfer tubes/catheters. From the risks analyses, a comprehensive QM program was developed.  Conclusion:   Both the RABBIT tool and process mapping and FMEA were shown to be valuable tools in developing a QM program for ultrasound-based HDR pBT treatments.

Yet, there are only very limited data on the safety and oncological effectiveness of robotic sLND.  Methods:   We retrospectively identified patients who underwent robotic sLND at our institution between 2013 and 2017 for nodal recurrence after RP, which had been diagnosed either by 18F-choline- or 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT. We analyzed perioperative data and early oncological outcomes with a focus on the comparison of patients with preoperative choline- vs. those with preoperative PSMA-PET/CT.  Results:   We identified 36 patients who underwent robotic sLND at a median time of 45.3 months [range 3.1;228.6] after RP, with nodal recurrences detected in 25 patients by PSMA- and in 11 by choline-PET/CT. Median preoperative PSA, operation time and blood loss were 1.98 ng/ml [range 0.09;35.15], 129.5 min [range 65;202] and 50 ml [range 0;400], respectively. No high-grade complications occurred. A median number of 6.5 [range 1;25] lymph nodes were removed with a median of 1 [range 0;9] tumor-occupied node. None of the patients received any adjuvant treatment. Median postoperative PSA-change was -57% [range -100; +58] in the PSMA- and +10% [range -91; +95] in the choline-group (p = 0.015). 44% of patients in the PSMA- and 18% of patients in the choline-group experienced complete biochemical response (cBCR; PSA <0.2 ng/ml). Median time from sLND to the initiation of further therapy was 12 months [range 2;21.5] in the PSMA-group and 4.7 months [range 2.2;18.9] in the choline-group (p = 0.001).  Conclusions:   This is the hitherto largest series on robotic sLND for nodal recurrence after RP. Robotic sLND is a feasible therapeutic option with low morbidity, which can at least delay the initiation of further therapy - in some patients up to several years. However, the extend of sLND has to be standardized and randomized trials are needed to finally define the oncological effectiveness of this approach.""","""['Johannes Linxweiler', 'Matthias Saar', 'Zaid Al-Kailani', 'Martin Janssen', 'Samer Ezziddin', 'Michael Stöckle', 'Stefan Siemer', 'Carsten-Henning Ohlmann']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Surg Oncol""","""['Assessing the Best Surgical Template at Salvage Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection for Nodal Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: When Can Bilateral Dissection be Omitted?

Results: 285 men, mean age 65.9 years participated, 61 (21%) were CPC (-); 57 (20%) were CPC (+) CD82 (+) and 167 (59%) were CPC (+) CD82 (-). Group 1 had low grade small volume cancer, in Group 2, low grade but a larger volume than Group 1 and Group 3 high grade cancer. Kaplan Meier biochemical free survival curves at 36, 60 and 120 months were; Group 1 98%, 96% and 90%; for Group 2 93%, 93% and 69% and for Group 3 62%, 44% and 16% respectively. Conclusions: Kaplan Meier survival curves for Group 1 and Group 2 were similar, although Group 2 men had higher PSA values, more advanced staging but a similar Gleason score. Group 3 men had a worse prognosis. The results support that biological characteristics of CPCs are more important than their mere presence identifying men with a high risk of biochemical failure.""","""['Nigel P Murray', 'Socrates Aedo', 'Cynthia Fuentealba', 'Eduardo Reyes']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Combining the Prostate Cancer Risk Index (PRIX) with the Presence of Secondary Circulating Prostate Cells to Predict the Risk of Biochemical Failure after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of the Walz Nomogram and Presence of Secondary Circulating Prostate Cells for Predicting Early Biochemical Failure after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer in Chilean Men.', 'Limited improvement of incorporating primary circulating prostate cells with the CAPRA score to predict biochemical failure-free outcome of radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Prediction model for early biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy based on the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score and the presence of secondary circulating prostate cells.', 'The presence of secondary circulating prostate tumour cells determines the risk of biochemical relapse for patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer who are treated only with external radiotherapy.', 'Biochemical failure and toxicity in treatment with brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy compared with radical prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer.', 'A Systematic Review of Circulating Tumor Cells Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Role of Metastasis Suppressor KAI1/CD82 in Different Cancers.', 'Position of Circulating Tumor Cells in the Clinical Routine in Prostate Cancer and Breast Cancer Patients.', 'Integrin-associated CD151 is a suppressor of prostate cancer progression.']"""

Another advance to strengthen inference of disease data is the extension of purely spatial models to include time aspect. We aim to combine the idea of multivariate shared components with spatio-temporal modelling in a joint disease mapping model and apply it for incidence rates of seven prevalent cancers in Iran which together account for approximately 50% of all cancers. Methods: In the proposed model, each component is shared by different subsets of diseases, spatial and temporal trends are considered for each component, and the relative weight of these trends for each component for each relevant disease can be estimated. Results: For esophagus and stomach cancers the Northern provinces was the area of high risk. For colorectal cancer Gilan, Semnan, Fars, Isfahan, Yazd and East-Azerbaijan were the highest risk provinces. For bladder and lung cancer, the northwest were the highest risk area. For prostate and breast cancers, Isfahan, Yazd, Fars, Tehran, Semnan, Mazandaran and Khorasane-Razavi were the highest risk part. The smoking component, shared by esophagus, stomach, bladder and lung, had more effect in Gilan, Mazandaran, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Kohgilouyeh and Boyerahmad, Ardebil and Tehran provinces, in turn. For overweight and obesity component, shared by esophagus, colorectal, prostate and breast cancers the largest effect was found for Tehran, Khorasane-Razavi, Semnan, Yazd, Isfahan, Fars, Mazandaran and Gilan, in turn. For low physical activity component, shared by colorectal and breast cancers North-Khorasan, Ardebil, Golestan, Ilam, Khorasane-Razavi and South-Khorasan had the largest effects, in turn. The smoking component is significantly more important for stomach than for esophagus, bladder and lung. The overweight and obesity had significantly more effect for colorectal than of esophagus cancer. Conclusions: The presented model is a valuable model to model geographical and temporal variation among diseases and has some interesting potential features and benefits over other joint models.""","""['Behzad Mahaki', 'Yadollah Mehrabi', 'Amir Kavousi', 'Volker J Schmid']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Bivariate spatiotemporal disease mapping of cancer of the breast and cervix uteri among Iranian women.', 'Multivariate disease mapping of seven prevalent cancers in Iran using a shared component model.', 'Trend of hepatocellular carcinoma incidence after Bayesian correction for misclassified data in Iranian provinces.', 'A diversity of cancer incidence and mortality in West Asian populations.', 'Using mortality to predict incidence for rare and lethal cancers in very small areas.', 'A Systematic Review of Areal Units and Adjacency Used in Bayesian Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Conditional Autoregressive Models in Health Research.', 'A Systematic Review of Joint Spatial and Spatiotemporal Models in Health Research.', 'A joint Bayesian spatiotemporal risk prediction model of COVID-19 incidence, IC admission, and death with application to Sweden.', 'Shared component modelling of early childhood anaemia and malaria in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda.', 'Relative Risk of Gastrointestinal Cancers in Isfahan County, Iran, 2005-2010.']"""

Methods: A case-control study was conducted in Córdoba, Argentina (period 2008-2015) including 147 cases of PC and 300 controls. All subjects were interviewed about food consumption, socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics. A sample of drinking water was taken to determine arsenic concentrations. Adherence scores to the Traditional Dietary Pattern were estimated, based on a principal component factor analysis. A two-level logistic regression model was fitted in order to assess effects of the Traditional Pattern, occupation and arsenic exposure on the occurrence of PC (outcome). Family history of PC was considered as a clustering variable. Results: PC risk was greatest in subjects with high adherence to the Traditional Pattern (OR 2.18; 95%IC 1.097–4.344). Subjects exposed to arsenic in drinking water above 0.01mg/l who simultaneously performed agricultural activities showed a markedly elevated PC risk (OR 5.07; 95%IC 2.074-12.404). Variance of the random effect of family history of PC was significant. conclusion: Diet, arsenic and occupation in agriculture exert significant effects on PC risk.

The photophysical properties of HL and ZnL2 are disclosed and supported by CAMB3LYP DFT/TDDFT calculations. It is shown that there is keto-tautomer stabilization upon excitation with an energetically accessible triplet state in HL, not present in ZnL2, this explaining the differences found in the emissions of the compounds. The intrinsic fluorescence of ZnL2 is used as probe for a detailed study of its binding to human serum albumin. The protein-complex association is thermodynamically favourable and it is shown by fluorescence quenching and time-resolved analysis that the fluorescence quenching involves a mixed mechanism with prevalence of static quenching, which corroborates adduct formation at site I, close to the Trp214 residue. The ability of ZnL2 to bind DNA was also evaluated, as well as its cytotoxic activity against MCF7 (breast), PC3 (prostate) cancer cells and hamster V79 fibroblasts. ZnL2 is a moderate DNA intercalator (Kapp = 3.9 × 104 M-1) and depicts a quite low IC50 value at 48 h against MCF7 cells (IC50 = 530 nM), but much higher for PC3 and V79 cells.

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Male Depression Risk Scale-22 (MDRS-22) were completed online along with demographic and background variables by 100 men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer ( n = 54 prostatectomy, n = 33 receiving active treatment). Hierarchical logistic regression was used to examine recent (past 2 weeks) suicide ideation. Over one-third of the sample (38%) reported a comorbidity, and this group had significantly higher total depression scores on the PHQ-9 (Cohen's d = 0.65), MDRS-22 emotion suppression ( d = 0.35), and drug use subscales ( d = 0.38) compared to respondents without comorbidity. A total of 14% reported recent suicidal ideation, of which 71.4% of cases were identified by the PHQ-9 ""moderate"" cut-off, and 85.7% of cases were identified by the MDRS-22 ""elevated"" cut-off. After control variables, MDRS-22 subscales accounted for 45.1% of variance in recent suicidal ideation.

Patients and methods:   In all, 1081 men with localised prostate cancer were treated with permanent brachytherapy, of which 615 had staging SVB and 53 (9.4%) were positive. Higher stage, Gleason score and PSA level were associated with a +SVB (P < 0.001). Patients with +SVB and negative laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection, bone and CT scans had 3 months of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) followed by 103 Pd implant to the prostate (dose 100 Gy) and proximal SVs, and 2 months later 45 Gy EBRT. ADT was continued for a median of 6 months (total ADT 9 months). The mean (range) follow-up was 9 (5-22) years.  Results:   Biochemical freedom from failure (computed by the Phoenix definition), freedom from metastasis, and cause-specific survival (CSS) for patients with a negative SVB (-SVB) vs +SVB at 15 years, was 76.3% vs 60.6% (P = 0.001), 95.4% vs 78.2% (P < 0.001), and 95% vs 70.4% (P < 0.001), respectively.

Simvastatin has recently been demonstrated to serve a potential role in the prophylaxis and therapeutics of a number of human cancers. The majority of reports concerning simvastatin treatment in the majority of human cancers have demonstrated that survivin is significantly decreased as a result and has been implicated in tumorigenesis. However, only a limited number of studies have investigated the use of simvastatin for the treatment of salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC). Therefore, this agent is a candidate for further investigation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of simvastatin on the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of the human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cell line, SACC‑83, as well as survivin expression in the cells. The Cell Counting kit‑8 assay results revealed that simvastatin inhibited the proliferation of SACC‑83 cells in a dose‑dependent (10 to 50 µM) and time‑dependent (24 to 48 h) manner when compared with the untreated cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that simvastatin increased the percentage of cells in early and late apoptosis. Invasion assays revealed that simvastatin treatment inhibited the invasiveness of SACC‑83 cells in a dose‑dependent manner. In addition, simvastatin downregulated survivin expression in SACC‑83 cells. In conclusion, simvastatin significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of SACC‑83 cells, induced apoptosis, and reduced the expression of survivin, which suggests that simvastatin may be a novel target for SACC therapy.""","""['Wen-Yan Cai', 'Ying Zhuang', 'Fei Yan', 'Ting Li', 'Wen-Ting Song', 'Jin-Hu Sun']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['The expression of MACC1 and its role in the proliferation and apoptosis of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.', 'Role of miR-21 in the growth and metastasis of human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.', 'Effect of simvastatin and microRNA-21 inhibitor on metastasis and progression of human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.', 'Downregulation of hypoxia‑inducible factor-1α inhibits growth, invasion, and angiogenesis of human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma cells under hypoxia.', 'ID1 contributes to cell growth invasion and migration in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.', 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma of Salivary Glands: A Ten-Year Review and an Assessment of the Current Management, Surgery, Radiotherapy, and Chemotherapy.', 'The anti-tumor effect of proteasome inhibitor MG132 for human adenoid cystic carcinoma: correlate with the emerging role of Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway.', 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma of Salivary Gland: A Ten-Year Single Institute Experience.', 'The effects of statins on dental and oral health: a review of preclinical and clinical studies.', 'Transcriptome analyses identify hub genes and potential mechanisms in adenoid cystic carcinoma.']"""

The DNase sequencing data (GSE33216) and RNA sequencing data (GSE22260) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. DNase I hypersensitive sites were detected and analyzed. Subsequently, DEGs were identified and their potential functions were enriched. Finally, upstream regulatory elements of DEGs were predicted. In LNCaP cells, following androgen receptor activation, 244 upregulated and 486 downregulated open chromosomal regions were identified. However, only 1% of the open chromosomal regions were dynamically altered. The 41 genes with upregulated open chromosomal signals within their promoter regions were primarily enriched in biological processes. Additionally, 211 upregulated and 150 downregulated DEGs were identified in prostate cancer, including eight transcription factors (TFs). Finally, nine regulatory elements associated with prostate cancer were predicted. In particular, inhibitor of DNA binding 1 HLH protein (ID1) was the only significantly upregulated TF which exhibited motif enrichment in the promoter regions of upregulated genes. CCCTC‑binding factor (CTCF) and ELK1 ETS transcription factor (ELK1), enriched in the open promoter regions of downregulated genes, were potential upstream regulatory elements. Furthermore, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that ID1 expression was significantly upregulated in LNCaP cells and 5α‑dihydrotestosterone (DHT)‑treated LNCaP cells compared with that in BPH1 cells, while CTCF and ELK1 expression was significantly downregulated in LNCaP cells and DHT‑treated LNCaP cells.

In the present study, the antitumor activity of PPI in prostate cancer (PC) cells was evaluated. At low doses, PPI decreased proliferation, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PC cells. PPI decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7), an enzyme that is critical for tumor metastasis. PPI also decreased the expression of Snail and vimentin, which are EMT-associated factors. Additionally, PPI suppressed AP-1 transcriptional activity and AP-1 binding to the MMP7 and vimentin promoters. The results demonstrated that PPI downregulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signaling‑related kinase (ERK), which is upstream modulator of AP-1. The results of the present study demonstrated that PPI may inhibit the cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A)/protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)/ERK axis, downregulate the expression of MMP7, vimentin, and Snail, and suppress tumor invasion and EMT. A PC xenograft mouse model was employed and the results revealed that PPI may decrease tumor growth and weight. Additionally, PPI may inhibit proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and CIP2A/PP2A/ERK signaling pathway in PPI-treated tumors. Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that PPI may suppress the growth, invasion and EMT of PC cells via inhibition of CIP2A/PP2A/ERK signaling axis.

A transwell assay was employed to test cell migration. We identified PHB2 as an interaction partner of LOC283070 in the pull-down and RIP experiments. Furthermore, we confirmed that the enrichment of LOC283070 with PHB2 in androgen-independent LNCaP (LNCaP-AI) cells was much greater than that in LNCaP cells. Moreover, the expression of PHB2 was not significantly different between the two cell lines, and the expression of LOC283070 in the nuclei of the LNCaP-AI cells was significantly greater than that in the LNCaP cells. In vitro data revealed that PHB2 overexpression significantly inhibited AR activity and cell proliferation and migration and induced accumulation of prostate cancer cells in G0/G1 phase. Moreover, the overexpression of LOC283070 fully abrogated the effects of PHB2 overexpression. In conclusion, we found that LOC283070 can bind to PHB2 located in the nucleus and inhibit its effect, and this is one of the mechanisms by which LOC283070 is involved in the transition of LNCaP cells into androgen-independent cells.""","""['Ying Zhang', 'Li-Na Wang', 'Ya-Ni Lin', 'Yuan-Xin Xing', 'Yu Shi', 'Jian Zhao', 'Wei-Wen Chen', 'Bo Han']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Long non-coding RNA LOC283070 mediates the transition of LNCaP cells into androgen-independent cells possibly via CAMK1D.', 'The prostate cancer-up-regulated long noncoding RNA PlncRNA-1 modulates apoptosis and proliferation through reciprocal regulation of androgen receptor.', 'Overexpression of lysine-specific demethylase 1 promotes androgen-independent transition of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells through activation of the AR signaling pathway and suppression of the p53 signaling pathway.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Long non-coding RNAs related to androgen receptor function in prostate cancer: Advances in studies.', 'ceRNA network of lncRNA MIR210HG/miR-377-3p/LMX1A in malignant proliferation of glioma cells.', 'Interaction between Non-Coding RNAs and Androgen Receptor with an Especial Focus on Prostate Cancer.', 'Novel cytoplasmic lncRNA IKBKBAS promotes lung adenocarcinoma metastasis by upregulating IKKβ and consequential activation of NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Epigenetic Mechanisms of LncRNAs Binding to Protein in Carcinogenesis.', 'SFPH proteins as therapeutic targets for a myriad of diseases.']"""

This radionuclide is targeting actively bone-forming cells, and it is approved for treating metastatic skeletal disease in prostate cancer. 18F-PET is used to detect skeletal metastatic disease based on osteoblastic activity. The aim of this study was to analyze, if 18F-PET can be used assessing the results of 223Ra therapy, and to report final median overall survival in a total of 773 therapy cycles.  Methods:   A 161 men with castration-resistant prostate cancer were included in a single institution study (Protocol#: PA14-0848) and they received a total of 773 223Ra therapy cycles.  Results:   The median overall survival (95% CI) was 12.4 (9.1, 16.1) months in patient population. Interim Na18F-PET imaging was applied in 14 patients at baseline, after 3 cycles and after 6 cycles. TLF10 (skeletal disease burden at SUV-values >10 on Na18F -PET) were calculated in all these PET studies, and there was no significant association between change in TLF10 after 3 cycles and TLF10 after 6 cycles (p=0.20).

Our group previously identified a panel of differentially methylated CpGs in primary tumor tissue that predict disease aggressiveness, and here we further validate these biomarkers.  Methods:   Pyrosequencing was used to assess CpG methylation of eight biomarkers previously identified using the HumanMethylation450 array; CpGs with strongly correlated (r >0.70) results were considered technically validated. Logistic regression incorporating the validated CpGs and Gleason sum was used to define and lock a final model to stratify men with metastatic-lethal versus non-recurrent PCa in a training dataset. Coefficients from the final model were then used to construct a DNA methylation score, which was evaluated by logistic regression and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses in an independent testing dataset.  Results:   Five CpGs were technically validated and all were retained (P < 0.05) in the final model. The 5-CpG and Gleason sum coefficients were used to calculate a methylation score, which was higher in men with metastatic-lethal progression (P = 6.8 × 10-6 ) in the testing dataset. For each unit increase in the score there was a four-fold increase in risk of metastatic-lethal events (odds ratio, OR = 4.0, 95%CI = 1.8-14.3). At 95% specificity, sensitivity was 74% for the score compared to 53% for Gleason sum alone. The score demonstrated better prediction performance (AUC = 0.91; pAUC = 0.037) compared to Gleason sum alone (AUC = 0.87; pAUC = 0.025).

This analysis reports on participant outcomes from Project HEAL. Fifteen churches were randomized to the two CHA training methods and the intervention impact was examined over 24 months. This study was conducted in Prince George's County, MD, and enrolled 375 church members age 40-75. Participants reported on knowledge and screening behaviors for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. Overall, cancer knowledge in all areas increased during the study period (p < .001). There were significant increases in digital rectal exam (p < .05), fecal occult blood test (p < .001), and colonoscopy (p < .01) at 24 months; however, this did not differ by study group. Mammography maintenance (56% overall) was evidenced by women reporting multiple mammograms within the study period. Participants attending all three workshops were more likely to report a fecal occult blood test or colonoscopy at 24 months (p < .05) than those who attended only one. These findings suggest that lay individuals can receive web-based training to successfully implement an evidence-based health promotion intervention that results in participant-level outcomes comparable with (a) people trained using the traditional classroom method and (b) previous efficacy trials.

Recent studies show that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as miRNA sponges, playing important roles in cancer physiology and development. Despite accumulating appreciation of the importance of lncRNAs, the study of their complex functions is still in its preliminary stage. Based on the hypothesis of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), several computational methods have been proposed for investigating the competitive relationships between lncRNAs and miRNA target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). However, when the mRNAs are released from the control of miRNAs, it remains largely unknown as to how the sponge lncRNAs influence the expression levels of the endogenous miRNA targets.  Results:   We propose a novel method to construct lncRNA related miRNA sponge regulatory networks (LncmiRSRNs) by integrating matched lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles with clinical information and putative miRNA-target interactions. Using the method, we have constructed the LncmiRSRNs for four human cancers (glioblastoma multiforme, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer). Based on the networks, we discover that after being released from miRNA control, the target mRNAs are normally up-regulated by the sponge lncRNAs, and only a fraction of sponge lncRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships and hub lncRNAs are shared by the four cancers. Moreover, most sponge lncRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships show a rewired mode between different cancers, and a minority of sponge lncRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships conserved (appearing) in different cancers may act as a common pivot across cancers. Besides, differential and conserved hub lncRNAs may act as potential cancer drivers to influence the cancerous state in cancers. Functional enrichment and survival analysis indicate that the identified differential and conserved LncmiRSRN network modules work as functional units in biological processes, and can distinguish metastasis risks of cancers. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of integrating expression profiles, clinical information and miRNA-target interactions for investigating lncRNA regulatory mechanism.

Design, setting, and participants:   This blinded correlative study conducted from December 31, 2012, to September 1, 2016, included 142 patients with histologically confirmed mCRPC and who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, The Royal Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre.

By determined expression in human prostate cancer tissues, URG11 was found significantly upregulated and positively correlated with the severity of prostate cancer, compared with that in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues. Further, the mRNA and protein levels of URG11 were significantly upregulated in human prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC3, and LNCaP), compared with human prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1). Moreover, by the application of siRNA against URG11, the proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells were markedly inhibited. Genetic knockdown of URG11 also induced cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase, induced apoptosis, and decreased the expression level of β-catenin in prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of URG11 promoted the expression of β-catenin, the growth, the migration, and invasion ability of prostate cancer cells.

Patients and methods:   Within the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2014), we focused on newly diagnosed mPCa patients. Data were stratified according to the site of metastases and age group. Cumulative incidence smoothed plots were generated for CSM and OCM at 5 years after diagnosis, according to the competing-risks methods. Multivariable competing-risks analyses tested the effect of the location of PCa metastases on CSM.  Results:   Among 18,404 patients with mPCa, the majority had exclusively bone metastases (63.6%). At 5 years, CSM rate was 59.7% and OCM rate was 14%. According to the location of metastases, CSM rates were 44.5%, 57.9%, 67.1%, 62.7%, 66%, and 76.3% for exclusively lymph node (LN), exclusively bone, bone plus LN, exclusively visceral, visceral plus LN, and visceral plus LN and bone disease, respectively.

Currently, detection techniques for CTCs are mainly based on the physical and/or epithelial characteristics of tumor cells. However, biofunctional activity markers that can indicate the high metastatic capacity of CTCs are lacking.  Methods:   Functional microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot were used on five prostate cancer cell lines with different metastatic capacities to identify the metastasis-related metabolic genes. The identified genes were detected in the CTCs of 64 clinical samples using the RNA in situ hybridization. A multi-criteria weighted model was used to determine the optimal metabolic markers for the CTCs test. Based on five fluorescent signals targeting DAPI, CD45, metabolic, epithelial (EpCAM/CKs), and mesenchymal (Vimentin/Twist) markers, the filtration-enriched CTCs were classified as GM+CTCs/GM-CTCs (metabolic types) or E-CTCs/H-CTCs/M-CTCs (EMT types). Correlation analysis and ROC curve were conducted on 54 prostate cancer samples to evaluate the clinical significance of CTCs subtypes.  Results:   Eight metastasis-related metabolic genes were identified, including HK2, PDP2, G6PD, PGK1, PHKA1, PYGL, PDK1, and PKM2. Among them, PGK1 and G6PD were determined as optimal glucose metabolic (GM) markers for CTCs. GM+CTCs (marked by PGK1/G6PD) were detectable in 64.8% (35/54) of prostate cancer patients, accounting for 46.5% (134/288) of total CTCs. An increased GM+CTCs level was associated with advanced tumor stage and metastasis (P < 0.05). In the discrimination of cancer metastasis from non-metastasis, GM+CTCs presented a higher AUC of the ROC curve (0.780) compared with the EMT CTCs subtypes (E-CTCs 0.729, H-CTCs 0.741, and M-CTCs 0.648). A triple tPSA-Gleason-GM+CTCs marker increased the AUC to 0.904, which was better than that of the tPSA-Gleason-H-CTCs marker (0.874).  Conclusions:   The metabolic marker (PGK1/G6PD) is determined as the indicator for the biofunctional activity analysis of CTCs, compared with the existing morphological (EMT) classification on CTCs. The metabolic characterization of CTCs demonstrates that hypermetabolic GM+CTCs are promising biomarkers for prostate cancer metastasis.""","""['Jing Chen', 'Shunwang Cao', 'Bo Situ', 'Juan Zhong', 'Yanwei Hu', 'Shufen Li', 'Jinlan Huang', 'Jiasen Xu', 'Shiyang Wu', 'Jinduan Lin', 'Qianwen Zhao', 'Zhen Cai', 'Lei Zheng', 'Qian Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Metabolic classification of circulating tumor cells as a biomarker for metastasis and prognosis in breast cancer.', 'Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition leads to disease-stage differences in circulating tumor cell detection and metastasis in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer.', 'Classification of circulating tumor cells by epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers.', 'Clinical and biological significance of circulating tumor cells in cancer.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells and Implications of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Single-cell metabolic fingerprints discover a cluster of circulating tumor cells with distinct metastatic potential.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Mitochondria dysfunction in circulating tumor cells.', 'Crosstalk of Redox-Related Subtypes, Establishment of a Prognostic Model and Immune Responses in Endometrial Carcinoma.', 'Liquid Biopsy Based Circulating Biomarkers in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   1995 men undergoing ORRP enrolled in a prospective longitudinal outcomes study. The American Urological Association Symptom Index was self-administered before ORRP and at predetermined time-points after surgery. A multivariate generalized linear model was used to evaluate the association of time since ORRP with American Urological Association symptom score (AUASS). McNemar's test and paired sample t-tests were used to assess whether the proportion of men with clinically significant LUTS (CSLUTS) defined by an AUASS >7 or mean AUASS differed significantly between the time-dependent assessments, respectively.  Results:   The 15-year mean adjusted AUASS was similar to baseline (7.00 vs 6.85, P = .66). Throughout the 15 years of follow-up, the proportion of men with CSLUTS was lower than baseline with the exception of the 3 month and 15 year assessments. Among men with baseline clinically insignificant LUTS (CILUTS), the mean adjusted AUASS at 15 years was significantly greater than baseline (6.09 vs 3.19, P < .001). Among men with baseline CSLUTS, ORRP led to a significant decrease in mean adjusted AUASS between baseline and 15 years (13.26 vs 8.67, P < .001).

However, studies have found divergent effects of intraoperative mannitol administration on postoperative AKI. We therefore evaluated the effects of intraoperative mannitol administration on AKI after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) in prostate cancer patients.A total of 864 patients who underwent RALP were divided into mannitol (administered at 0.5 g/kg) and no-mannitol groups. Demographics, cancer-related data, preoperative laboratory values, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes such as AKI, chronic kidney disease at 12 months postoperation, duration of hospital stay, and intensive care unit admission rate and duration of stay were compared between the 2 groups using propensity score matching analysis. To determine the risk factors for AKI after RALP, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Postoperative AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria.After performing 1:1 propensity score matching, the mannitol and no-mannitol groups included 234 patients each. The overall incidence of AKI after RALP was 5.1% and was not significantly different between the no-mannitol and mannitol groups in the propensity score-matched patients (13 [5.6%] vs. 11 [4.7%], P = .832). Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that body mass index and operative time were associated with AKI in 864 patients who underwent RALP. However, intraoperative mannitol administration was not associated with AKI after RALP (P = .284). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that operative time was significantly associated with AKI after RALP (odds ratio = 1.013, P = .001). The incidence of chronic kidney disease (13 [5.6%] vs. 12 [5.1%], P = 1.000) and other postoperative outcomes were not also significantly different between the no-mannitol and mannitol groups in the propensity score-matched patients.Intraoperative mannitol administration has no beneficial effect on the prevention of AKI after RALP in prostate cancer patients.

Most MPNs are double, and triple primary neoplasms are extremely rarer. Here, we describe a case of a 66-year-old man diagnosed with metachronous triple primary neoplasms with primary prostate cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer.  Patient concerns:   The patient complained of dysuria in January 2015, and he underwent transurethral resection of the prostate. The pathological results showed acinar adenocarcinoma of prostate with a Gleason score of 3+3. In January 2017, he complained of lower abdominal pain, then he took an enteroscopy examination, found a mass in the sigmoid colon, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography examination showed masses in the sigmoid colon and right upper lobe of the lung. Biopsy of the colon showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog exon 2 mutation, and biopsy of the lung showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with epidermal rowth factor receptor exon 21 mutation.  Diagnoses:   Metachronous triple primary neoplasms with primary prostate cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer.  Interventions:   The patient underwent surgical resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, postoperative stage was T1bN0M0 (stage IA). After 8 cycles of chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 regimen (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m, leucovorin 400 mg/m, 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m on day 1, followed by 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m intravenous infusion over 46 hours every 2 weeks), the patient underwent radical resection of colon cancer, and he finished the remaining 4 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 regimen chemotherapy in November 2017.

An isotoxic model was developed to maximize the given dose while controlling the toxicity level. This was applied to analyze the effect of an implantable rectum spacer (IRS) and extended with a genetic test of normal tissue radio-sensitivity. A virtual IRS (V-IRS) was tested using this method. We hypothesized that the patients with increased risk of toxicity would benefit more from an IRS.  Material and methods:   Sixteen localized prostate cancer patients implanted with an IRS were included in the study. Treatment planning was performed on computed tomography (CT) images before and after the placement of the IRS and with a V-IRS. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was calculated using a QUANTEC reviewed model for Grade > =2 late rectal bleeding and the number of fractions of the plans were adjusted until the NTCP value was under 5%. The resulting treatment plans were used to calculate the TCP before and after placement of an IRS. This was extended by adding the effect of two published genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) for late rectal bleeding.  Results:   The median TCP resulting from the optimized plans in patients before the IRS was 75.1% [32.6-90.5%]. With IRS, the median TCP is significantly higher: 98.9% [80.8-99.9%] (p < .01). The difference in TCP between the V-IRS and the real IRS was 1.8% [0.0-18.0%]. Placing an IRS in the patients with SNP's improved the TCP from 49.0% [16.1-80.8%] and 48.9% [16.0-72.8%] to 96.3% [67.0-99.5%] and 90.1% [49.0-99.5%] (p < .01) respectively for either SNP.

Five hundred and forty-four men attending the PCa booth at the fair in 2014 or 2015 completed questionnaires about PCa. Data were examined using Pearson's χ2, Fisher's Exact, and Wilcoxon rank tests after grouping men by African American (AA) and non-African American ethnicity. Three hundred and twenty-six (60%) men were AA and two hundred and eighteen (40%) were non-AA (89% white). Median age (54 vs. 56 years) and prior PCa screening were similar between AA and non-AA; income ( p = .044) and education ( p = .0002) differed. AA men were less likely to have researched prostate-specific antigen (PSA) on the internet ( p = .003), but more used TV ( p = .003) and media ( p = .0014) as information sources. Family members had a stronger influence over screening decisions for AA men ( p = .005). After reading PSA information, AA men were more likely to still be confused ( p = .008). A higher proportion of AA men were less worried about dying from PCa ( p = .0006), but would want treatment immediately instead of watchful waiting ( p < .0001). Interestingly, a higher proportion of AA men indicated that they would prefer not to know if they had PCa ( p = .001). Ultimately, more AA men had a PSA done (98.4% vs. 95.1%; p = .031). When considering screening eligible men, a higher proportion of AA men had an abnormal PSA (13.1% vs. 5.3%; p = .037).

Resources can play an important role in this adjustment process, but research on this topic is limited, especially for very long-term survivors. This study explores, which resources are most frequently indicated by different subgroups of cancer survivors, and what role resources play for functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in cancer survivors with and without recurrence.  Methods:   The sample of 6030 breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivors (5-16 years post-diagnosis) was recruited in a German multi-regional population-based study. Personal resources were assessed by a 27-item checklist; HRQL was assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). General linear models were used to analyze associations of resources with HRQL.  Results:   Participants indicated on average 11.4 (SD 5.1) resources as helpful. Family, activities with others, and partnership were indicated most commonly overall, but frequencies varied according to age, sex, and tumor site. Physical activity, health, professional help, calmness, hope, optimism, and hobbies were most important in explaining HRQL variance.

Acquiring a better understanding of the mechanisms that control the development of CRPC remains an unmet clinical need. The well-established dependency of cancer cells on the tumour microenvironment indicates that the microenvironment might control the emergence of CRPC. Here we identify IL-23 produced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as a driver of CRPC in mice and patients with CRPC. Mechanistically, IL-23 secreted by MDSCs can activate the androgen receptor pathway in prostate tumour cells, promoting cell survival and proliferation in androgen-deprived conditions. Intra-tumour MDSC infiltration and IL-23 concentration are increased in blood and tumour samples from patients with CRPC. Antibody-mediated inactivation of IL-23 restored sensitivity to androgen-deprivation therapy in mice. Taken together, these results reveal that MDSCs promote CRPC by acting in a non-cell autonomous manner. Treatments that block IL-23 can oppose MDSC-mediated resistance to castration in prostate cancer and synergize with standard therapies.""","""['Arianna Calcinotto', 'Clarissa Spataro', 'Elena Zagato', 'Diletta Di Mitri', 'Veronica Gil', 'Mateus Crespo', 'Gaston De Bernardis', 'Marco Losa', 'Michela Mirenda', 'Emiliano Pasquini', 'Andrea Rinaldi', 'Semini Sumanasuriya', 'Maryou B Lambros', 'Antje Neeb', 'Roberta Lucianò', 'Carlo A Bravi', 'Daniel Nava-Rodrigues', 'David Dolling', 'Tommaso Prayer-Galetti', 'Ana Ferreira', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Antonio Esposito', 'Simon Barry', 'Wei Yuan', 'Adam Sharp', 'Johann de Bono', 'Andrea Alimonti']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Myeloid-derived IL-23 drives CRPC.', 'Resistance to prostate-cancer treatment is driven by immune cells.', 'IL-23 promotes the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Interleukin-23 Represses the Level of Cell Senescence Induced by the Androgen Receptor Antagonists Enzalutamide and Darolutamide in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Effective combinatorial immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of drug resistance that target the androgen axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The potential role of the microbiota in prostate cancer pathogenesis and treatment.', 'Immunogenomic profiles associated with response to life-prolonging agents in prostate cancer.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'New insights and options into the mechanisms and effects of combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of bicalutamide resistance-related genes and prognosis prediction in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

Setting:   Home-based, computer-assisted face-to-face survey.  Participants:   2111 adults aged 18-70 years in England recruited using random location sampling by a survey company. Data from 1888 participants were analysed after exclusions due to missing data.  Interventions:   Participants were given one of two pieces of text describing overdiagnosis, allocated at random, adapted from National Health Service breast and prostate cancer screening leaflets.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Main outcomes were which of several available terms (eg, 'overdetection') participants had previously encountered and which they endorsed as applicable labels for the concept described. Demographics and previous exposure to screening information were also measured. Main outcomes were summarised with descriptive statistics. Predictors of previously encountering at least one term, or endorsing at least one as making sense, were assessed using binary logistic regression.  Results:   58.0% of participants had not encountered any suggested term; 44.0% did not endorse any as applicable labels. No term was notably familiar; the proportion of participants who had previously encountered each term ranged from 15.9% to 28.3%. Each term was only endorsed as applicable by a minority (range: 27.6% to 40.4%). Notable predictors of familiarity included education, age and ethnicity; participants were less likely to have encountered terms if they were older, not white British or had less education. Findings were similar for both pieces of information.  Conclusions:   Familiarity with suggested terms for overdiagnosis and levels of endorsement were low, and no clear alternative labels for the concept were identified, suggesting that changing terminology alone would do little to improve understanding, particularly for some population groups.

Results:   We propose a novel application of CNNs to classification of pairwise alignments of sequences for accurate clustering of sequences and show the benefits of the CNN method of inputting pairwise alignments for clustering of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) sequences and for motif discovery. Classification of a pairwise alignment of two sequences into positive and negative classes corresponds to the clustering of the input sequences. After we combined the distributed representation of RNA nucleotides with the secondary-structure information specific to ncRNAs and furthermore with mapping profiles of next-generation sequence reads, the training of CNNs for classification of alignments of RNA sequences yielded accurate clustering in terms of ncRNA families and outperformed the existing clustering methods for ncRNA sequences. Several interesting sequence motifs and secondary-structure motifs known for the snoRNA family and specific to microRNA and tRNA families were identified.

Methods:   Pre-treatment serum levels of YKL-40 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were analyzed in 109 castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who underwent DOC-therapy. Responsive patients were retreated by repeated series of DOC. Results were compared with the clinical parameters as well as overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS).  Results:   YKL-40 but not PSA serum levels were significantly higher in patients with baseline resistance to DOC (p = 0.035). Higher YKL-40 and PSA levels were detected in patients with bone metastasis (p = 0.032; p = 0.010) and in those who were not pre-treated with radical prostatectomy (p = 0.011, p = 0.008). High YKL-40 levels were associated with shorter OS (p = 0.037) and DSS (p = 0.017) in patients who received DOC in the first-line setting. In multivariable analysis, ECOG performance status (p = 0.009), presence of any metastases (p = 0.016) and high PSA levels (p = 0.005) remained independent predictors for DSS.

However, the role PCGEM1 plays in epithelial ovarian cancer is unknown.  Methods:   PCGEM1 expression was examined in epithelial ovarian cancer and normal ovarian tissues using reverse transcription-PCR. Ovarian cancer cell phenotypes and genotypes were examined after PCGEM1 overexpression or downregulation in vitro; besides, the effects of PCGEM1 overexpression was also examined in vivo.  Results:   PCGEM1 expression level was higher in epithelial ovarian cancer tissues than in normal ovarian tissues and was positively associated with differentiation (Well vs. Mod/Poor). Upregulation of PCGEM1 induced cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, but decreased cell apoptosis through upregulating RhoA, YAP (Yes-associated protein), MMP2 (matrix metalloproteinase 2), Bcl-xL, and P70S6K expression; while PCGEM1 downregulation had the opposite effect. The nude mouse xenograft assay demonstrated that PCGEM1 overexpression promoted tumor growth. Furthermore, silencing RhoA expression reversed the effect of PCGEM1 and significantly inhibited RhoA, YAP, MMP2, Bcl-xL, and P70S6K protein expression.

Materials and methods:   The relative gene expression (RE) of 33 transcripts (27 genes) and the presence/absence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion were analyzed by a quantitative PCR. 37 prostate cancer tissues (T) paired with conventionally normal prostate tissue (CNT) and 21 samples of prostate adenomas were investigated. RE changes were calculated, using different protocols of statistics.  Results:   We demonstrated differences in RE of seven genes between tumors and CNT, as was calculated, using the 2-ΔCT model and the Wilcoxon matched paired test. Five genes (ESR1, KRT18, MKI67, MMP9, PCA3) showed altered expression in adenocarcinomas, in which the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion was detected. Two genes (INSR, isoform B and HOTAIR) expressed differently in tumors without fusion. Comparison of the gene expression pattern in adenomas, CNT and adenocarcinomas demonstrated that in adenocarcinomas, bearing the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion, genes KRT18, PCA3, and SCHLAP1 expressed differently. At the same time, we detected differences in RE of AR (isoform 2), MMP9, PRLR and HOTAIR in adenocarcinomas without the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion. Two genes (ESR1 and SRD5A2) showed differences in RE in both adenocarcinoma groups. Fourteen genes, namely AR (isoforms 1 and 2), CDH1, OCLN, NKX3-1, XIAP, GCR (ins AG), INSR (isoform A), IGF1R, IGF1R tr, PRLR, PRL, VDR and SRD5A2 showed correlation between RE and tumor stage. RE of four genes (CDH2, ESR2, VDR and SRD5A2) correlated with differentiation status of tumors (Gleason score). Using the K-means clustering, we could cluster adenocarcinomas in three groups, according to gene expression profiles. A specific subtype of prostate tumors is characterized by the activated ERG signaling, due to the presence of TMPRSS2/ERG fusion, and also by high levels of the androgen receptor, prolactin, IGF, INSR and PCA3.  Conclusions:   We have found the specific differences in expression of the steroid and peptide hormone receptors, metabolic enzymes and EMT-related genes, depending on the pre-sence/absence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion in prostate adenocarcinomas, CNT and adenomas.

Radium-223 became the first approved radiopharmaceutical which decreased skeletal-related events, palliated pain, and showed improved overall survival in symptomatic patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastasis only.  Materials and methods:   We present the case of an eighty-two year old man with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who was treated with sequential therapy (abiraterone - enzalutamide - radium 223).

Results:   The treatment of these patients is changing rapidly, but many questions remain regarding the optimal sequencing of the available drugs.

The time to the first use of a subsequent antineoplastic therapy was longer with enzalutamide treatment than with placebo (39.6 vs. 17.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.21; P<0.001; such therapy was used in 15% vs. 48% of patients) as was the time to PSA progression (37.2 vs. 3.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.07; P<0.001; progression occurred in 22% vs. 69% of patients). At the first interim analysis of overall survival, 103 patients (11%) receiving enzalutamide and 62 (13%) receiving placebo had died. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 31% of the patients receiving enzalutamide, as compared with 23% of those receiving placebo.  Conclusions:   Among men with nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer with a rapidly rising PSA level, enzalutamide treatment led to a clinically meaningful and significant 71% lower risk of metastasis or death than placebo. Adverse events were consistent with the established safety profile of enzalutamide.

MAPK kinase 1 (MEK1) is the upstream protein kinase of ERK that can activate ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. microRNA 203 (MiR-203) down-regulation is found to be associated with prostate cancer pathogenesis. Bioinformatics analysis showed the complementary targeted relationship between miR-203 and the 3'-UTR of MEK1 mRNA. This study explored the role of miR-203 in regulating prostate cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, and ADM resistance through affecting MEK1 expression.  Materials and methods:   Dual luciferase assay confirmed the targeted relationship between miR-203 and MEK1. MiR-203, MEK1, p-ERK1/2, and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expressions were compared in normal prostate epithelial cells PrEC, prostate cancer cells PC-3M, and drug resistance cells PC-3M/ADM. PC-3M, PC-3M/ADM cell apoptosis and proliferation were detected by using flow cytometry under ADM treatment at IC50 concentration of PC-3M cells. PC-3M cells were cultured in vitro and divided into four groups, including microRNA-normal control (miR-NC), miR-203 mimic, small interfere NC (si-NC), and si-MEK1.  Results:   MiR-203 targeted and inhibited MEK1 expression. MiR-203 levels and cell apoptosis were significantly lower, while MEK1, p-ERK1/2, Bcl-2, and cell proliferation were significantly higher in PC-3M/ADM cells compared to the PC-3M cells. MiR-203 mimic and/or si-MEK1 transfection significantly reduced MEK1, p-ERK1/2, and Bcl-2 levels, attenuated cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, and decreased drug resistance.  Conclusions:   MiR-203 elevation suppressed prostate cancer PC-3M cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and weakened ADM resistance through targeted inhibiting MEK1 expression to alleviate ERK/MAPK signaling pathway and Bcl-2 expression.""","""['L-Z Chen', 'Z Ding', 'Y Zhang', 'S-T He', 'X-H Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['MiR-203 over-expression promotes prostate cancer cell apoptosis and reduces ADM resistance.', 'MiR-101 promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell apoptosis through inhibiting Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.', 'Targeted regulation of miR-195 on MAP2K1 for suppressing ADM drug resistance in prostate cancer cells.', 'miR-181a down-regulates MAP2K1 to enhance adriamycin sensitivity in leukemia HL-60 cells.', 'MiR-16 inhibits pituitary adenoma cell proliferation via the suppression of ERK/MAPK signal pathway.', 'Interplay between MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and MicroRNAs: A crucial mechanism regulating cancer cell metabolism and tumor progression.', 'Non-coding RNA and cholesteatoma.', '7SK Acts as an Anti-tumor Factor in Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of the prognostic significance of microRNAs related to metastatic and EMT process among prostate cancer patients.', 'miR-203 affects esophageal cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion by targeting MAP3K1.', 'The Significance of MicroRNAs Expression in Regulation of Extracellular Matrix and Other Drug Resistant Genes in Drug Resistant Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines.']"""

Whether the treatment of PCa increases the occurrence of MetS remains to be confirmed. This study reviewed the changes in MetS patients before and after PCa treatment to evaluate the effects of various treatment methods on MetS. We analyzed data of 1162 PCa patients, whether or not diagnosed with MetS, and changes in MetS patients after PCa treatment. Data of lower urinary tract symptoms, C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet distribution width (PDW), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, clinical stage, treatment methods, and progressive incidents were evaluated using logistic regression according to MetS diagnosis. The results showed significant differences in the prevalence of MetS before (17.38%) and after (23.67%) PCa treatment (P < 0.001). Bad diet, living habits, and prostate cancer treatment were considered as risk factors for MetS (OR = 1.731, 95%CI 1.367-2.193, P < 0.001). Radical prostatectomy (RP), androgen deprivation therapy including surgical castration and medical castration, iodine-125 seed brachytherapy (125I limited), and chemotherapy were independent risk factors of MetS. The MetS incidence rates after treatment in ADT+125I limited+chemotherapy compared to RP+TURP+EBRT were statistically significant at the corresponding risk grade (all P < 0.001). After treatment, the occurrence rates of progressive incidences were higher in MetS-PCa patients compared to non-MetS-PCa patients (all P < 0.001). So, the findings suggested that among PCa patients, multiple factors contribute to the occurrence of MetS, and PCa treatment is one among them.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) using SPION in prostate cancer and to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy.  Methods:   Twenty patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled in 2016. After intraprostatic injection of SPION, SLND using magnetometer was performed the following day. Extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) was added as a reference standard test. The diagnostic performance of the test were evaluated, as well as the rate of in vivo detected SLN. Surgical times of SLND and ePLND were compared using paired two-sample t test.  Results:   In total, 97 SLN were detected with median 5 (IQR 3-7) per patient. Non-diagnostic rate of the procedure was 5%. In total, 19 nodal metastases were found in 5 patients, of which 12 were located in SLN. The sensitivity per patient for the whole cohort was 80% and per node 56%. If only patients with at least one detected SLN were considered, the sensitivity per patient and per node reached 100 and 82%, respectively. A median of 20 LNs (IQR 18-22) were removed by subsequent ePLND. Surgical times of SLND and ePLND differed significantly, with medians of 17 and 39 min, respectively (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   SLND with SPION is feasible and safe in prostate cancer and the diagnostic accuracy is comparable to the published results of radioguided procedures.

We characterized trends in treatment modalities for MIBC from 2004 to 2013 (the ""pre-immunotherapy era"") and identified predictors of receiving the current standard of care treatment: neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy (RC).  Methods:   We used the National Cancer Database to identify individuals diagnosed with clinically localized MIBC from 2004 to 2013. We calculated the yearly prevalence of NAC followed by RC, RC as first treatment, trimodal therapy, chemotherapy and/or radiation alone, and no treatment. We then identified factors associated with receiving NAC prior to RC.  Results:   There was a notable increase in the use of NAC followed by RC over the study period, from 3.68% in 2004 to 14.83% in 2013 (P < 0.001). Factors associated with decreased odds of receiving this regimen included being older, Black, uninsured, less educated, and more burdened by comorbidities. Rates of trimodal therapy and chemotherapy and/or radiation alone remained relatively constant (approximately 5 and 17%, respectively). There was a consistent decline in the proportion of patients who did not receive any treatment, down to 34.20% in 2013.  Conclusion:   Trends in localized MIBC treatment have evolved substantially since the early 2000s, and certain patient characteristics are associated with lower odds of receiving the current standard of care. This serves as a foundation from which to judge the impact of the upcoming immunotherapy era on the treatment landscape for this disease.""","""['Sean A Fletcher', 'Sabrina S Harmouch', 'Marieke J Krimphove', 'Alexander P Cole', 'Sebastian Berg', 'Philipp Gild', 'Mark A Preston', 'Guru P Sonpavde', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Maxine Sun', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer with variant histology.', 'Optimization of Patient Selection for Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Muscle-invasive Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder.', 'Modeling 1-year Relapse-free Survival After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Radical Cystectomy in Patients with Clinical T2-4N0M0 Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma: Endpoints for Phase 2 Trials.', 'ypT0N0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer: Incidence and prognosis.

Methods and materials:   The fiducial marker tracking capability for each arc was evaluated through a proposed formula. The output of the formula, a detectability score, was calculated with the in-house developed software written in MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Three unique weighting factors were added to penalize the detectability score. The detectability scores of four different patterns containing 40 combinations of simulated fiducial marker locations were evaluated with 101 previously treated prostate treatment plans (containing 202 individual arcs). The results were analyzed for each pattern group and each marker separation distance on the transverse plane.  Results:   The maximum detectability of the markers occurred when they were placed between 10 and 15 mm from the center of the prostate in the transverse plane and 6-13 mm in the superior-inferior direction.

Approximately 30-40% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) also have neuroendocrine involvement. In contrast primary small cell prostate cancer is very rare (<1%). A t‑NEPC should be clinically suspected in patients who have particularly aggressive mCRPC but a disproportionately low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and elevated neuroendocrine tumor markers, such as chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase. The initial Gleason score was shown to be an independent factor correlated to the risk of development of t‑NEPC. Treatment is oriented to that of small cell lung cancer. In patients with negative PSA levels, chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide is the first line treatment, for which response rates in the range of 30-60% with a median survival time of usually less than 1 year can be achieved. In patients with much higher serum PSA levels, chemotherapy with carboplatin plus docetaxel should be considered.""","""['S Tritschler', 'R Erdelkamp', 'C Stief', 'M Hentrich']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Pathologe""","""['Neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Chromogranin A and neurone-specific enolase serum levels as predictors of treatment outcome in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer undergoing abiraterone therapy.', 'Chromogranin A: a useful biomarker in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Phase II study of carboplatin and etoposide in patients with anaplastic progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with or without neuroendocrine differentiation: results of the French Genito-Urinary Tumor Group (GETUG) P01 trial.', 'Neuroendocrine prostate cancer: subtypes, biology, and clinical outcomes.', 'AR antagonists develop drug resistance through TOMM20 autophagic degradation-promoted transformation to neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Deficiency of NEIL3 Enhances the Chemotherapy Resistance of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Lack of consensus exists regarding the clinical benefit of BIC use, either alone or combined use of BIC with an LHRH analog or antagonist (combined androgen blockade or CAB), versus treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone.  Methods:   The SEER-Medicare database was used to identify prostate cancer patients aged ≥ 66 years diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 and who filled at least one prescription for BIC. Duration of BIC treatment was assessed in relation to ADT use; either alone (monotherapy), as part of CAB only, and as part of CAB followed by monotherapy. Additionally, we assessed use of BIC during or outside a potential testosterone flare prevention period (initiation within 2 months of an LHRH agonist).  Results:   A total of 7521 prostate cancer patients who filled a prescription for BIC were identified. Eighteen percent of the cohort used BIC alone, over half the patients (54%) used BIC as part of CAB and 27% used BIC as part of CAB followed by monotherapy. Among men treated with BIC as part of CAB, 58% received BIC only within the potential flare period.  Conclusions:   Although there is no FDA indication for BIC use as monotherapy, > 44% of patients in this study used BIC alone or as part of CAB followed by monotherapy. Further research is necessary to understand the outcomes of BIC utilization in these settings, particularly compared with newer second-generation anti-androgens.

Here, we present consumption and supply-based hypoxia (CSH) imaging, an approach that integrates images related to oxygen consumption and supply into a single image. This integration algorithm was developed in patients with prostate cancer receiving hypoxia marker pimonidazole prior to prostatectomy. We exploited the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) signal in diagnostic diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) images to generate separate images of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional blood volume (fBV). ADC and fBV correlated with cell density (CD) and blood vessel density (BVD) in histology and whole-mount sections from 35 patients, thus linking ADC to oxygen consumption and fBV to oxygen supply. Pixel-wise plots of ADC versus fBV were utilized to predict the hypoxia status of each pixel in a tumor and to visualize the predicted value in a single image. The hypoxic fraction (HFDWI) of CSH images correlated strongly (R2 = 0.66; n = 41) with pimonidazole immunoscore (HSPimo); this relationship was validated in a second pimonidazole cohort (R2 = 0.54; n = 54). We observed good agreement between CSH images and pimonidazole staining in whole-mount sections. HFDWI correlated with tumor stage and lymph node status, consistent with findings for HSPimo Moreover, CSH imaging could be applied on histologic CD and BVD images, demonstrating transferability to a histopathology assay. Thus, CSH represents a robust approach for hypoxia imaging in prostate cancer that could easily be translated into clinical practice.Significance: These findings present a novel imaging strategy that indirectly measures tumor hypoxia and has potential application in a wide variety of solid tumors and other imaging modalities.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/16/4774/F1.large.jpg Cancer Res; 78(16); 4774-85. ©2018 AACR.""","""['Tord Hompland', 'Knut Håkon Hole', 'Harald Bull Ragnum', 'Eva-Katrine Aarnes', 'Ljiljana Vlatkovic', 'A Kathrine Lie', 'Sebastian Patzke', 'Bjørn Brennhovd', 'Therese Seierstad#', 'Heidi Lyng#']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Quantification of Tumor Hypoxia through Unsupervised Modelling of Consumption and Supply Hypoxia MR Imaging in Breast Cancer.', 'Preoperative evaluation of pelvine lymph node metastasis in high risk prostate cancer with intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI.', 'Hypoxia in prostate cancer: correlation of BOLD-MRI with pimonidazole immunohistochemistry-initial observations.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The clinical utility of imaging methods used to measure hypoxia in cervical cancer.', 'Intravoxel incoherent motion predicts positive surgical margins and Gleason score upgrading after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Prediction of prostate tumour hypoxia using pre-treatment MRI-derived radiomics: preliminary findings.', 'Association of serum hepcidin with prostate-specific antigen levels in men from high Andean cities of Peru.', 'Advances in PET and MRI imaging of tumor hypoxia.', 'The future of MRI in radiation therapy: Challenges and opportunities for the MR community.']"""

From the 2005 to the 2014 consensus conferences, organized by the International Society of Urological Pathology, the morphologic criteria for the identification of the Gleason patterns were redefined, thus resulting in the shrinkage of the Gleason pattern 3. This led to the expansion of the Gleason pattern 4. The newly proposed grade group system reduces the Gleason scores of prostate cancer to the lowest number, each associated with a unique behavior from the prognostic point of view. The advantage is that the simplified system with five groups allows for a more accurate stratification of the patients in comparison with the Gleason system. Cribriform, fused, ill-defined and glomeruloid glands are part of the histologic spectrum of the Gleason pattern 4. Cribriform morphology has a prognosis that is worse in comparison with the other non-cribriform Gleason 4 patterns. One of the major implications of the cribriform growth is that it precludes a patient from choosing active surveillance.""","""['Rodolfo Montironi', 'Alessia Cimadamore', 'Liang Cheng', 'Antonio Lopez-Beltran', 'Marina Scarpelli']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Biol Markers""","""['Prostate cancer with cribriform morphology: diagnosis, aggressiveness, molecular pathology and possible relationships with intraductal carcinoma.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'SOCS3 Immunohistochemical Expression Seems to Support the 2005 and 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Modified Gleason Grading System.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Controversial issues in Gleason and International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) prostate cancer grading: proposed recommendations for international implementation.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer: The Impact of Grading Criteria and the Significance of the Amount of Intraductal Carcinoma.', 'Narrative review of prostate cancer grading systems: will the Gleason scores be replaced by the Grade Groups?']"""
