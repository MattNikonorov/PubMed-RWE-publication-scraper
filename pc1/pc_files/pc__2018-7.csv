Patients and methods:   Sixty-nine men were recruited to assess immunohistochemical expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) of periprostatic fat of RP specimens. Per cent immunopositivity was quantified on scanned slides using the Aperio Positive Pixel Count algorithm for PPAT TNFα, VEGF and androgen receptors. Periprostatic fat volume (PFV) was segmented on contiguous T1 -weighted axial MRI slices from the level of the prostate base to apex. PFV was normalized to prostate volume (PV) to account for variations in PV (normalized PFV = PFV/PV). MRI quantitative values (Kep , Ktrans and apparent diffusion coefficient) were measured from the PCa primary lesion using Olea Sphere software. Patients were stratified into three groups according to RP Gleason score (GS): ≤6, 7(3 + 4) and ≥7(4 + 3).  Results:   The mean rank of VEGF and TNFα was significantly different between the groups [H(2) = 11.038, P = 0.004] and [H(2) = 13.086, P = 0.001], respectively. Patients with stage pT3 had higher TNFα (18.2 ± 8.95) positivity than patients with stage pT2 (13.27 ± 10.66; t [67] = -2.03, P = 0.047). TNFα expression significantly correlated with Ktrans (ρ = 0.327, P = 0.023). TNFα (P = 0.043), and VEGF (P = 0.02) correlated with high grade PCa (GS ≥ 7) in RP specimens and also correlated significantly with upgrading of GS from biopsy to RP histology.  Conclusions:   The expression levels of TNFα and VEGF on immunostaining significantly correlated with aggressivity of PCa. As biomarkers, these indicate the risk of having high grade PCa in men undergoing RP.""","""['Naief Dahran', 'Magdalena Szewczyk-Bieda', 'Sarah Vinnicombe', 'Stewart Fleming', 'Ghulam Nabi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Normalized periprostatic fat MRI measurements can predict prostate cancer aggressiveness in men undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localised disease.', 'PI-RADS v2 and periprostatic fat measured on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging can predict upgrading in radical prostatectomy pathology amongst patients with biopsy Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20093 prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Periprostatic fat thickness on MRI: correlation with Gleason score in prostate cancer.', 'Interplay between Prostate Cancer and Adipose Microenvironment: A Complex and Flexible Scenario.', ""Role of Lipids and Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression and the Tumor's Immune Environment."", 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Combination therapy with curcumin plus tamsulosin and finasteride in the treatment of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a single center, randomized control study.', 'Digital Imaging Analysis Reveals Reduced Alveolar α-Smooth Muscle Actin Expression in Severe Asthma.', 'Prognostic Value of CT-Attenuation and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Uptake of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue in Patients with Prostate Cancer.']"""

In recent years, miRNAs are continually attracting attentions of researchers for their special regulatory function in human cancers. Previous study has revealed that miR-410 acts as a biomarker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Whereas, the specific biological function of miR-410-3p in prostate cancer remains unknown. The aim of this study is to explore the function and molecular mechanism of miR-410-3p in prostate cancer. The high expression of miR-410-3p was examined in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines by qRT-PCR. Next, the prognostic value was identified by Kaplan Meier method. High expression of miR-410-3p indicated poor prognosis of prostate cancer patients. To investigate the biological function of miR-410-3p in prostate cancer, loss-of function assays were designed and performed in two prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and DU145). As a result, downregulated miR-410-3p suppressed cell proliferation, migration and EMT progress. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis was performed to determine that the acceleration effects of miR-410-3p on cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, further analysis demonstrated that the effects of miR-410-3p exert oncogenic functions through downregulating PTEN. All findings in this study revealed that miR-410-3p inhibits prostate cancer progression via downregulating PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.""","""['Yuelong Zhang', 'Dahong Zhang', 'Jia Lv', 'Shuai Wang', 'Qi Zhang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['MiR-616-3p promotes angiogenesis and EMT in gastric cancer via the PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway.', 'Upregulation of miR-153 promotes cell proliferation via downregulation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene in human prostate cancer.', 'The PTEN-AKT-mTOR/RICTOR Pathway in Nasal Natural Killer Cell Lymphoma Is Activated by miR-494-3p via PTEN But Inhibited by miR-142-3p via RICTOR.', 'Deregulated PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in prostate cancer: Still a potential druggable target?', 'Assessment of miR-98-5p, miR-152-3p, miR-326 and miR-4289 Expression as Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Effect and Mechanism of lncRNA-PCMF1/hsa-miR-137/Twist1 Axis Involved in\xa0the EMT\xa0Regulation of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.', 'OncomiRs as noncoding RNAs having functions in cancer: Their role in immune suppression and clinical implications.', 'CircTMEM59 Serves as miR-410-3p Sponge to Inhibit the Proliferation and Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer by Regulating HOXD8.', 'MiR-5195-3p functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer via targeting CCNL1.']"""

Material and methods:   At first, a machine learning radiomic analysis was applied on T2-weighted (T2W) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) rectal wall MR images of prostate cancer patients' pre- and post-IMRT to predict rectal toxicity. Next, Wilcoxon singed ranked test was performed to find radiomic features with significant changes pre- and post-IMRT. A logistic regression classifier was used to find correlation between features with significant changes and radiation toxicity. Area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used in two levels of study for finding performances.  Results:   AUCmean, 0.68 ± 0.086 and 0.61 ± 0.065 were obtained for pre- and post-IMRT T2 radiomic models, respectively. For ADC radiomic models, AUCmean was 0.58 ± 0.034 for pre-IMRT and was 0.56 ± 0.038 for post-IMRT. Wilcoxon-signed rank test revealed that 9 T2 radiomic features vary significantly post-IMRT. The AUC of logistic-regression was in the range of 0.46-0.58 for single significant features and was 0.81 when all significant features were combined.

The mechanisms underlying the development of NEPC are poorly understood. A set of available data from a well-validated xenograft model of NEPC was used to analyze the exact role of protein kinase (PK) played in the development of NEPC. Fifty-four actionable and druggable PKs, mainly enriched in PI3K-Akt, mTOR, and MAPK signaling pathways, were screened out from the drastically changed PKs during NEPC transdifferentiation. Further analysis based on the crosstalk of these above signaling pathways finally singled out 10 PKs considered drivers and therapeutic targets in the development and treatment of NEPC. In vitro, the variation trend of PK expression observed during NEPC transdifferentiation could be recapitulated in PCa cell lines with different malignant degree. The predicted kinase targets exhibited different sensibilities in the restriction of PC3 cell growth. Selective actionable and druggable PKs may act as drivers in the progression of NEPC, and most of them can be used as potential therapeutic targets in clinical practice.""","""['Chao Lu', 'Yunkai Qie', 'Shenglai Liu', 'Changli Wu', 'Zhihong Zhang', 'Ranlu Liu', 'Kuo Yang', 'Hailong Hu', 'Yong Xu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""DNA Cell Biol""","""['Heterochromatin Protein 1α Mediates Development and Aggressiveness of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting RET Kinase in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Gene expression signatures of neuroendocrine prostate cancer and primary small cell prostatic carcinoma.', 'Systems Medicine Approaches to Improving Understanding, Treatment, and Clinical Management of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Neural Transcription Factors in Disease Progression.']"""

We used three supervised machine-learning algorithms and 19 different training variables (demographic, clinical, imaging and operative data) in a hypothesis-free manner to build models that could predict patients with biochemical recurrence at 1 year. We also performed traditional Cox regression analysis for comparison.  Results:   K-nearest neighbour, logistic regression and random forest classifier were used as machine-learning models. Classic Cox regression analysis had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.865 for the prediction of biochemical recurrence. All three of our machine-learning models (K-nearest neighbour (AUC 0.903), random forest tree (AUC 0.924) and logistic regression (AUC 0.940) outperformed the conventional statistical regression model.

Prostate-derived ETS factor (PDEF) is highly restricted to the hormone-regulated tissues of epithelial cells, such as those in the prostate, breast and other tissues. It has been demonstrated that PDEF expression is associated with AR in prostate cancer. In this research, we aimed to investigate the relationship between PDEF and AR in ER- BC.  Methods and results:   We immunohistochemically evaluated the correlation between PDEF and AR expression in 246 cases of ER- invasive BC, and investigated their relationship in ER- BC cell lines. The expression of PDEF was associated with the positive expression of AR (P < 0.001) and a worse survival rate (P = 0.006). PDEF+ tumours were significantly more often AR+ (P < 0.001). AR and PDEF were more often co-expressed and the series of AR+ PDEF+ (126 of 246, 51.2%) had a poor survival rate (P = 0.046). In Cox models, PDEF expression (P = 0.028) was an independent predictor for overall survival (OS). At the cellular protein and mRNA levels, our experiments also showed a statistically significant positive correlation between PDEF and AR, and that PDEF may be regulated by AR.  Conclusions:   PDEF is associated with markers of bad prognosis, supporting its role as a growth promoter in ER- BC. Our findings also provide evidence that PDEF is strongly correlated with AR expression in ER- breast cancer; it may be a downstream target gene of AR and a potential prognostic factor in ER- BC.""","""['Lu Cao', 'Congying Li', 'Cong Xu', 'Guomin Xiang', 'Fang Liu', 'Xiaozhen Liu', 'Jiao Jiao', 'Shuhua Lv', 'Yun Niu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['AR-PDEF pathway promotes tumour proliferation and upregulates MYC-mediated gene transcription by promoting MAD1 degradation in ER-negative breast cancer.', 'A high AR:ERα or PDEF:ERα ratio predicts a sub-optimal response to tamoxifen therapy in ERα-positive breast cancer.', 'Prognostic significance of androgen receptor expression in invasive breast cancer: transcriptomic and protein expression analysis.', 'Prostate-derived Ets factor, an oncogenic driver in breast cancer.', 'Prostate derived ETS factor (PDEF): a putative tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'Triple negative breast cancer: special histological types and emerging therapeutic methods.', 'Double Agent: SPDEF Gene with Both Oncogenic and Tumor-Suppressor Functions in Breast Cancer.', 'TRPM4 is overexpressed in breast cancer associated with estrogen response and epithelial-mesenchymal transition gene sets.', 'The expression and prognostic role of EBP1 and relationship with AR in HER2+ breast cancer.', 'AR-PDEF pathway promotes tumour proliferation and upregulates MYC-mediated gene transcription by promoting MAD1 degradation in ER-negative breast cancer.']"""

Methods:   Fifty-four consecutive patients were included in this study: one group included 27 patients who underwent laparoscopic low anterior and the other included 27 patients who underwent TaTME. All patients were asked to complete five questionnaires related to quality of life (QOL) and function [EQ-5D-3L, EORTC-QLQ C30, EORTC-QLQ C29, Low Anterior Resection Syndrome score (LARS), and International Prostate Symptom Score IPSS].

The objective was to analyze the effect of MRI reporting on target definition and cancer detection.  Methods:   202 patients underwent MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy with Artemis™ (Eigen, USA). mpMRI results were submitted in written form to urologists, who marked the targets in the proprietary software. An expert uroradiologist reviewed and marked mpMRI targets blinded to biopsy data. We compared number, localization and volume of targets between the observers and analyzed whether variations impaired TB results by bivariate and logistic regression models.  Results:   Interobserver variability was moderate regarding number and low regarding localization of targets. Urologists overestimated target volumes significantly compared to radiologists (p = 0.045) and matching target volume between both observers was only 43.9%. Overall cancer detection rate was 69.8 and 52.0% by TB. A higher matching target volume was a significant predictor of cancer in TB (p < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed prostate volume and PI-RADS as independent predictors. Defining targets in incorrect T2w slices in the cranio-caudal axis are one presumable reason for missing cancer in TB.  Conclusions:   A high concordance of the target definition between radiologist and urologist is mandatory for accurate TB. Optimized ROI definition is recommended to improve TB results, preferably as contouring in MRI sequences by the radiologist or, if not feasible, by precise MRI reports including specific localization in sequence and slice as well as an illustration.

Methods:   HUWE1 was overexpressed (through transfection) or downregulated (through lentiviral transduction) in CaP cell lines, PC3 and DU145 cells. The functions of HUWE1 overexpression or downregulation on CaP cancer cell proliferation, migrationin vitro, and explant in vivo were examined. In addition, the regulatory effect of HUWE1 on c-Myc expression was assessed. In HUWE1-overexpressed CaP cells, c-Myc was further upregulated to assess whether c-Myc was directly involved in HUWE1-induced regulation in CaP.  Results:   HUWE1 overexpression inhibited CaP proliferation and migrationin vitro, and explant growth in vivo. On the other hand, HUWE1 downregulation had no effects on CaP in vitro. C-Myc was downregulated in HUWE1-overexpressed, but un-changed in HUWE1-downregulated, CaP cells. Further upregulating c-Myc in HUWE1-overexpressed CaP cells reversed the tumor-suppressing effects by HUWE1-overexpression on cancer proliferation and migration in vitro.

Methods:   Differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) of PCa were screened out from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Combined with TCGA RNA sequencing data and clinical information, the DMCs associated genes with different expression and related to BCR were selected as candidate genes. Then, the expression level of the best candidate gene ZNF154 was validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Finally, the prognosis potential of the hypermethylation gene ZNF154 was assessed by Kaplan-Meier, univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis.  Results:   A total of 87 candidate genes were screened out. Compared to benign prostate (BP) tissues, ZNF154 has three hypermethylation sites (cg03234186, cg12506930, cg26465391) in the promoter region in PCa tissues. qRT-PCR results showed that ZNF154 expression level was reduced in PCa tissues than in BP tissues (P = 0.004). Besides, the ZNF154 methylation level was negatively correlated with mRNA expression (r = -0.766, P < 0.001), and was highly cancer-specific in PCa (area under the curves (AUCs) = 90.030%). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed ZNF154 methylation level was associated with BCR (P = 0.005), and ZNF154 could be an independent factor for BCR prediction in PCa by using univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis (P = 0.035, HR = 8.218).  Conclusions:   87 PCa specific genes were obtained. Further analysis gave the evidence that ZNF154 can be used as a specific maker for PCa diagnosis. Hypermethylation level of ZNF154 lead to gene expression inhibition and function loss, which contribute to the development and poor outcomes in PCa.

For robotic radiosurgery, systems for automatic generation of clinically deliverable plans do not yet exist. For prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), few studies have systematically compared VMAT with robotic treatment.  Material and methods:   The multi-criteria autoplanning optimizer, developed at our institute, was coupled to the commercial treatment planning system of our robotic treatment unit, for fully automated generation of clinically deliverable plans (autoROBOT). The system was then validated by comparing autoROBOT plans with manually generated plans. Next, the autoROBOT system was used for systematic comparisons between autoROBOT plans and VMAT plans, that were also automatically generated (autoVMAT). CTV-PTV margins of 3 mm were used for autoROBOT (clinical routine) and autoVMAT plan generation. For autoVMAT, an extra plan was generated with 5 mm margin (often applied for VMAT). Plans were generated for a 4 × 9.5 Gy fractionation scheme.  Results:   Compared to manual planning, autoROBOT improved rectum D[Formula: see text] (16%), V[Formula: see text] (75%) and D[Formula: see text] (41%), and bladder D[Formula: see text] (37%) (all p [Formula: see text] .002), with equal PTV coverage. In the autoROBOT and autoVMAT comparison, both with 3 mm margin, rectum doses were lower for autoROBOT by 5% for rectum D[Formula: see text] (p=.002), 33% for V[Formula: see text] (p=.001) and 4% for D[Formula: see text] (p=.05), with comparable PTV coverage and other OAR sparing. With 5 mm margin for VMAT, 18/20 plans had a PTV coverage lower than requested (<95%) and all plans had higher rectum doses than autoROBOT (mean percentage differences of 13% for D[Formula: see text], 69% for V[Formula: see text] and 32% for D[Formula: see text] (all p<.001)).  Conclusions:   The first system for fully automated generation of clinically deliverable robotic plans was built. Autoplanning did largely enhance robotic plan quality, compared to manual planning. Using autoplanning for both the robotic system and VMAT, superiority of non-coplanar robotic treatment compared to coplanar VMAT for prostate SBRT was demonstrated.""","""['Linda Rossi', 'Abdul Wahab Sharfo', 'Shafak Aluwini', 'Maarten Dirkx', 'Sebastiaan Breedveld', 'Ben Heijmen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Fully automated, multi-criterial planning for Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy - An international multi-center validation for prostate cancer.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer: dosimetric impact of an increased near-maximum target dose and of a rectal spacer.', 'Automated volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for whole pelvic prostate radiotherapy.', 'Advances in Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'The gimbaled-head radiotherapy system: Rise and downfall of a dedicated system for dynamic tumor tracking with real-time monitoring and dynamic WaveArc.', 'Machine Learning for Predicting Clinician Evaluation of Treatment Plans for Left-Sided Whole Breast Radiation Therapy.', 'Using Artificial Intelligence for Optimization of the Processes and Resource Utilization in Radiotherapy.', 'Enhancing Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients with iCE, a Novel System for Automated Multi-Criterial Treatment Planning Including Beam Angle Optimization.', 'Variations in Head and Neck Treatment Plan Quality Assessment Among Radiation Oncologists and Medical Physicists in a Single Radiotherapy Department.', 'Comparison of volumetric modulated arc therapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy for left-sided whole-breast irradiation using automated planning.']"""

Here, the insertion of scFvs to three additional cancer targets—EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), EGFRvIII, and PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen)—in gD Δ6–38 enabled the generation of specifically retargeted o-HSVs. Viable recombinants resulted from the insertion of an scFv in place of aa 6–38, but not in place of aa 61–218. Hence, only the gD N-terminus accepted all tested scFv inserts. Additionally, the insertion of mIL12 in the US1-US2 intergenic region of the HER2- or EGFRvIII-retargeted o-HSVs, and the further insertion of Gaussia Luciferase, gave rise to viable recombinants capable of secreting the cytokine and the reporter. Lastly, we engineered two known mutations in gB; they increased the ability of an HER2-retargeted recombinant to spread among murine cells. Altogether, current data show that the o-HSV carrying the aa 6–38 deletion in gD serves as a platform for the specific retargeting of o-HSV tropism to a number of human cancer targets, and the retargeted o-HSVs serve as simultaneous vectors for two molecules.""","""['Laura Menotti', 'Elisa Avitabile', 'Valentina Gatta', 'Paolo Malatesta', 'Biljana Petrovic', 'Gabriella Campadelli-Fiume']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Viruses""","""['A Strategy for Cultivation of Retargeted Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Viruses in Non-cancer Cells.', 'Simultaneous Insertion of Two Ligands in gD for Cultivation of Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Viruses in Noncancer Cells and Retargeting to Cancer Receptors.', 'Dual Ligand Insertion in gB and gD of Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Viruses for Retargeting to a Producer Vero Cell Line and to Cancer Cells.', 'Retargeting Strategies for Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Viruses.', 'Rethinking herpes simplex virus: the way to oncolytic agents.', 'Novel mutations in UL24 and gH rescue efficient infection of an HSV vector retargeted to TrkA.', 'Innovative retargeted oncolytic herpesvirus against nectin4-positive cancers.', 'Fusion peptide is superior to co-expressing subunits for arming oncolytic herpes virus with interleukin 12.', 'Systems Biology Approaches for the Improvement of Oncolytic Virus-Based Immunotherapies.', 'Development of intravenously administered synthetic RNA virus immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer.']"""

The finding that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) induces alterations in the androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional program by AR coregulators activity in a context-dependent manner, offers the opportunity for identifying signatures discriminating different clinical states of prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Gel electrophoretic analyses combined with western blot showed that, in androgen-dependent PCa and CRPC in vitro models, the subcellular distribution of spliced and serine-phosphorylated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) isoforms can be associated with different AR activities. Using mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analyses, we showed that the protein sets of androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and ADT-resistant cell lines (PDB and MDB) co-immunoprecipitated with hnRNP K varied depending on the cell type, unravelling a dynamic relationship between hnRNP K and AR during PCa progression to CRPC. By comparing the interactome of LNCaP, PDB, and MDB cell lines, we identified 51 proteins differentially interacting with hnRNP K, among which KLK3, SORD, SPON2, IMPDH2, ACTN4, ATP1B1, HSPB1, and KHDRBS1 were associated with AR and differentially expressed in normal and tumor human prostate tissues.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy has been increasingly used in clinical practice.  Objective.—:   To investigate whether MRI-targeted biopsy may detect GS 7 prostate cancer with greater GP 4 quantity, and whether it improves biopsy/radical prostatectomy GS concordance.  Design.—:   A total of 243 patients with paired standard and MRI-targeted biopsies with cancer in either standard or targeted or both were studied, 65 of whom had subsequent radical prostatectomy.

Mean GP 4 percentage in GS 7 cancers was 31.0% ± 29.3% by MRI-targeted biopsy versus 25.1% ± 29.5% by standard biopsy.

Rapid, accurate organ recognition in medical imaging permits a variety of new quantitative diagnostic techniques. In the case of therapy with targeted radionuclides, it may permit comprehensive radiation dose analysis in a manner that would often be prohibitively time-consuming using conventional methods.  Methods:   An automated image segmentation tool was developed based on three-dimensional CNNs to detect right and left kidney contours on non-contrast CT images. Model was trained based on 89 manually contoured cases and tested on a cohort of patients receiving therapy with 177Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen-617 for metastatic prostate cancer. Automatically generated contours were compared with those drawn by an expert and assessed for similarity based on dice score, mean distance-to-agreement, and total segmented volume. Further, the contours were applied to voxel dose maps computed from post-treatment quantitative SPECT imaging to estimate renal radiation dose from therapy.  Results:   Neural network segmentation was able to identify right and left kidneys in all patients with a high degree of accuracy. The system was integrated into the hospital image database, returning contours for a selected study in approximately 90 s. Mean dice score was 0.91 and 0.86 for right and left kidneys, respectively. Poor performance was observed in three patients with cystic kidneys of which only few were included in the training data. No significant difference in mean radiation absorbed dose was observed between the manual and automated algorithms.  Conclusion:   Automated contouring using CNNs shows promise in providing quantitative assessment of functional SPECT and possibly PET images; in this case demonstrating comparable accuracy for radiation dose interpretation in unsealed source therapy relative to a human observer.""","""['Price Jackson', 'Nicholas Hardcastle', 'Noel Dawe', 'Tomas Kron', 'Michael S Hofman', 'Rodney J Hicks']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['A Pipeline for Automated Voxel Dosimetry: Application in Patients with Multi-SPECT/CT Imaging After 177Lu-Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy.', 'Estimation of the radiation dose in pregnancy: an automated patient-specific model using convolutional neural networks.', 'Fully automatic multi-organ segmentation for head and neck cancer radiotherapy using shape representation model constrained fully convolutional neural networks.', 'Two-stage deep learning model for fully automated pancreas segmentation on computed tomography: Comparison with intra-reader and inter-reader reliability at full and reduced radiation dose on an external dataset.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Results from an EANM survey on time estimates and personnel responsible for main tasks in molecular radiotherapy dosimetry.', 'Localization of spleen and kidney organs from CT scans based on classification of slices in rotational views.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear Medicine: Opportunities, Challenges, and Responsibilities Toward a Trustworthy Ecosystem.', 'The transformational potential of molecular radiomics.', 'A retrospective study of 3D deep learning approach incorporating coordinate information to improve the segmentation of pre- and post-operative abdominal aortic aneurysm.']"""

In the present work, we have characterized the role of Nup153 in a cellular model of prostate cancer (PCa). The analysis of several immortalized cell lines derived from freshly explants of prostate cancer specimens showed that Nup153 protein was higher and present in multimeric complexes with eNOS and ERβ as compared to normal/hyperplastic prostate epithelial cells. This phenomenon was enhanced in the presence of 17β-estradiol (E2, 10-7M). Further experiments revealed that eNOS and ERβ were present in a DNA binding complexes associated with Nup153 promoter as demonstrated by ChIPs. Notably, after Nup153 depletion (siNup153), a reduction of migration capacity and colony formation in primary tumor-derived and metastatic PCa cells was observed. In addition, eNOS and ERβ nuclear localization was lost upon siNup 153 regardless of E2 treatment, suggesting that Nup153 is a key regulator of prostate cancer cell function and of the nuclear translocation of these proteins in response to hormone stimulus. Taken altogether our findings indicate that in PCa cells: i. the expression and function of Nup153 is modulated by estrogen signaling; ii. Nup153 contributes to cell migration and proliferation; iii. Nup153 regulates the nuclear translocation of eNOS and ERβ by forming a multimeric complex. Our findings unveil Nup153 as a novel component of the estrogen-dependent multimeric complex, thus representing a potential therapeutic candidate in prostate cancer.""","""['Agnese Re', 'Claudia Colussi', 'Simona Nanni', 'Aurora Aiello', 'Lorenza Bacci', 'Claudio Grassi', 'Alfredo Pontecorvi', 'Antonella Farsetti']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Estrogen-dependent dynamic profile of eNOS-DNA associations in prostate cancer.', 'Estrogen induces androgen-repressed SOX4 expression to promote progression of prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of nuclear endothelial nitric oxide synthase in the endothelial and prostate microenvironments.', 'Versatility at the nuclear pore complex: lessons learned from the nucleoporin Nup153.', 'Functional importance of estrogen receptors in the periodontium.', 'Importins involved in the nuclear transportation of steroid hormone receptors: In silico and in vitro data.', 'Gasotransmitters in the tumor microenvironment: Impacts on cancer chemotherapy (Review).', 'Antibody Validation for Estrogen Receptor Beta.', 'Pillars and Gaps of S-Nitrosylation-Dependent Epigenetic Regulation in Physiology and Cancer.', 'Epigenetic regulation of neural stem cells: The emerging role of nucleoporins.']"""

Although under normoxia C4-2AT6, it is a CRPC cell line, expressed elevated pAkt, pS6 and Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) accompanied by elevated HIF-1a expression, 5% hypoxic condition further induced expression of these proteins. These results indicate hypoxic environment elevated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in aggressive prostate cancer. However, C4-2AT6 cells treated with mTOR inhibitor under hypoxia less decreased compared to cells treated with the same dose drugs under normoxia. Western blot analysis showed mTOR inhibitor: RAD001 not only inhibited pS6, but also increased the expression of PKM2 in a dose and time dependent manner. Pyruvate kinase acts on glycolysis. PKM2, which is frequently express in tumor cells, is one isoform of pyruvate kinase. PKM2 is reported to act as a transcription factor. In the present study overexpression of PKM2 in C4-2AT6 induced resistance to RAD001 under normoxia. To evaluate the therapeutic effect of targeting PKM2, we inhibited PKM2 in C4-2AT6 under hypoxia using si-PKM2. The number of C4-2AT6 under chronic hypoxia exposed to siPKM2 significantly decreased compared to intact C4-2AT6 under chronic hypoxia. Furthermore, si-PKM2 improved resistance to mTOR inhibitor in C4-2AT6. When examined using clinical samples, high PKM2 expression was correlated with a high Gleason score and poor PSA free survival. These results suggested that up-regulation of PKM2 is one possibility of resistance to mTOR inhibitor in CRPC.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively included patients with MRGB-2 after a negative MRGB-1 both between January 2006 and August 2016. This study included 62 patients (median age, 63 years; interquartile range [IQR], 58-66 years) with 75 sampled lesions during MRGB-2 left for analysis, and 63 lesions were resampled and 12 new lesions were sampled. Included patients had a prostate specific antigen (PSA) at MRGB-1 of 13 ng/mL (IQR, 5.8-20.0) and a PSA at MRGB-2 of 15 ng/mL (IQR, 9.0-22.5). All anonymized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were retrospectively reassessed according to Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 by two radiologists. Images of MRGB were compared to determine whether the same prostate lesion was biopsied during MRGB-1 and MRGB-2. Descriptive statistics were utilized to determine the yield of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) at MRGB-2. Gleason score of ≥ 3 + 4 was considered csPCa.  Results:   In 16/75 (21%) lesions csPCa was detected during MRGB-2. Of 63 resampled lesions, 13 (21%) harbored csPCa at MRGB-2. In two patients, csPCa was detected on repeat biopsy, while the volume of the lesion decreased between MRGB-1 and MRGB-2.

Methods:   A systematic literature search was carried out using the Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies examining the association between radiotherapy for prostate cancer and secondary colorectal cancer (rectal cancer and colon cancer) published before March 19, 2018. The risk of second colorectal cancer after radiotherapy was summarized using unadjusted odds ratio (OR) and adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to detect potential bias and heterogeneity.  Results:   After study selection, 16 reports were retrieved for analysis. When patients received radiotherapy compared with those unexposed to radiation, there was an increased risk of the rectal cancer (OR 1.37, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.85), but not colon cancer. According to adjusted HR, there was an increased risk of the rectal cancer (HR 1.64, 95%CI 1.39 to 1.94), and colon cancer (HR 1.33, 95%CI 1.02 to 1.76). The OR for rectal cancer showed an increased risk with longer latent period (5 years lag time versus 10 years lag time, OR: 1.56 versus 2.22). Brachytherapy had no association with second cancer across all analyses.

Fibronectin (FN) plays key roles in cell adhesion and affects the migratory behavior of cells. In the tumor microenvironment and also in the blood plasma during metastasis, FN displays increased expression, however its role in prostate cancer remains poorly understood. This study aimed to unveil the specific roles of FN as a soluble component, alone or in combination with a complex basement membrane. To investigate the impact of FN in neoplastic prostate cells, we evaluated the gene expression of LNCaP cells by RT-qPCR after exposure to soluble FN (25 µg/mL) either alone or in combination with a basement membrane. When FN was the predominant matrix element, such as in blood plasma, PCa tumor cells increased their expression of genes related to an invasive behavior and resistance to apoptosis, including CDH2, ITGA5, AKT1, and BCL2. However, the combined presence of FN and a complex basement membrane had the opposite effect on LNCaP cells, in which the expression levels of CDH2, ITGA5, AKT1, and BCL2 were reduced. Hierarchical clustering analysis with LNCaP and RWPE-1 cells showed that LNCaP cells exposed to an enriched extracellular matrix displayed an expression pattern more similar to that shown by RWPE-1 cells, a cell line that illustrates characteristics of the normal prostate epithelium.

Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective study of 625 consecutive patients with nonmetastatic clinically significant PCa undergoing focal HIFU therapy (Sonablate) in secondary care centres between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. A minimum of 6-mo follow-up was available for599 patients. Intermediate- or high-risk PCa was found in 505 patients (84%).  Intervention:   Disease was localised using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) combined with targeted and systematic biopsies, or transperineal mapping biopsies. Areas of significant disease were treated. Follow-up included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement, mpMRI, and biopsies.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint, failure-free survival (FFS), was defined as freedom from radical or systemic therapy, metastases, and cancer-specific mortality.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up was 56 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 35-70). The median age was 65 yr (IQR 61-71) and median preoperative PSA was 7.2 ng/ml (IQR 5.2-10.0). FFS was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI] 98-100%) at 1 yr, 92% (95% CI 90-95%) at 3 yr, and 88% (95% 85-91%) at 5 yr.

Aim:   To validate and examine the psychometric properties of the Sexual Distress Scale (SDS) and Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (SDS-R), which were recently validated for use within men, in samples of sexually functional and sexually dysfunctional men with PCa.  Methods:   A sample of 538 men (with and without PCa and with and without sexual dysfunction) were used to examine the psychometric properties of the SDS. Confirmatory factor analysis followed by tests of measurement bias, calculations of reliability, and estimation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to examine the psychometric properties of the SDS and SDS-R. A subsample of 321 men completed the survey again 1 month later, and their responses were used to examine test-retest reliability.  Outcomes:   Participants completed the SDS and SDS-R, as well as measures of sexual bother and sexual concerns, sexual function, sexual attitudes, and mood states.  Results:   The SDS and SDS-R assess 1 general domain of sexual distress; 1 violation of measurement invariance was found between men with and men without PCa, which limits the comparability of scores between these 2 groups. Internal consistency and test-retest reliabilities were above 0.93 and 0.82, respectively. Evidences of validity based on relations with other variables supported our predictions because sexual distress was associated with other measures of distress, sexual function, satisfaction, and mood and not correlated to sexual attitudes. Although the SDS and SDS-R discriminated between sexually functional and dysfunctional men, the accuracy of the cutoff scores was only moderate.  Clinical translation:   This instrument can be used by researchers and clinicians to examine sexual distress and can be used to elucidate how sexual distress relates to sexual function, well-being, and quality of life.  Strengths and limitations:   The SDS and SDS-R assess sexual distress independently of sexual function; however, with the current evidence, they should not be used to compare men with and men without PCa and to classify men with and men without sexual dysfunction.  Conclusion:   This study provides a validation of the SDS and SDS-R that can be used in samples of men with PCa and with and without sexual dysfunction for the assessment of distress.

Method:   Members (N = 565) of a state-wide prostate cancer support network in Queensland, Australia (Mage = 71.14, SD = 8.68) completed the HLQ along with the Medical Outcomes Study, 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36). Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to assess the internal structure of the HLQ. The effects (bs) of each of the nine health literacy factors on mental and physical health status were graphed and compared using Fishers exact test for comparing parameter estimates.

Health literacy factors reflecting social and health provider support, navigating health systems, finding and understanding health information, and active engagement with providers shared small to moderate associations with mental health status and little to no association with physical health status.  Conclusion:   Findings provide support for the use of the HLQ as a valid and reliable measure of health literacy in men with prostate cancer.

Methods:   The study population are patients from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database, who were 66 years or older and newly diagnosed with stage III and IV prostate cancer in 1992-2009 and underwent radiation therapy, where ADT was proven to be highly beneficial and its use was considered as most appropriate (n = 12,170). We use logistic regression to examine the receipt of ADT and linear regression to study factors associated with time to ADT initiation while controlling for baseline characteristics.  Results:   Overall, 77% of eligible patients received at least one form of ADT in combination with radiation therapy, of which 12% underwent orchiectomy and the rest received ADT, and 77.2% of non-Hispanic white and 80.7% of Hispanic patients received ADT compared to 73.8% of non-Hispanic black. After adjustment for demographic and tumor characteristics, black men and men of other races are less likely to receive ADT compared to white counterparts (OR = 0.64 and 0.74, respectively). The median time from cancer diagnosis to ADT initiation is 2 months. Once initiated, men received a median of seven drug injections. After controlling for covariates, race/ethnicity and geographic location (SEER areas) are associated with early initiation of therapy.

While previous studies have suggested that ADT negatively influences glycemic control in existing diabetes, its association with diabetes complications has not been investigated. In this study, we examined the association between ADT use and diabetes complications in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted among men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer between 1995 and 2008, enrolled in three integrated health care systems. Men had radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy (curative intent therapy), existing type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and were followed through December 2010 (n = 5,336). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations between ADT use and diabetes complications (any complication), and individual complications (diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic amputation or diabetic cataract) after prostate cancer diagnosis.  Results:   ADT use was associated with an increased risk of any diabetes complication after prostate cancer diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio, AHR, 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.23) as well as an increased risk of each individual complication compared to non-use.  Conclusion:   ADT use in men with T2DM, who received curative intent therapy for prostate cancer, was associated with an increased risk of diabetes complications. These findings support those of previous studies, which showed that ADT worsened diabetes control.

The aberrant accumulation of c-Myc oncoprotein, known to promote PCa onset and progression, may be due to the control of gene transcription and/or MEK/ERK-regulated protein stabilization. Here, we investigated the role of MEK/ERK signaling in PCa.  Methods:   LnCAP, 22Rv1, DU145, and PC3 PCa cell lines were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments. U0126, trametinib MEK/ERK inhibitors, and c-Myc shRNAs were used. Radiation was delivered using an x-6 MV photon linear accelerator. U0126 in vivo activity alone or in combination with irradiation was determined in murine xenografts.  Results:   Inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling down-regulated c-Myc protein in PCa cell lines to varying extents by affecting expression of RNA and protein, which in turn determined radiosensitization in in vitro and in vivo xenograft models of PCa cells. The crucial role played by c-Myc in the MEK/ERK pathways was demonstrated in 22Rv1 cells by the silencing of c-Myc by means of short hairpin mRNA, which yielded effects resembling the targeting of MEK/ERK signaling. The clinically approved compound trametinib used in vitro yielded the same effects as U0126 on growth and C-Myc expression. Notably, U0126 and trametinib induced a drastic down-regulation of BMX, which is known to prevent apoptosis in cancer cells.  Conclusions:   The results of our study suggest that signal transduction-based therapy can, by disrupting the MEK/ERK/c-Myc axis, reduce human PCa radioresistance caused by increased c-Myc expression in vivo and in vitro and restores apoptosis signals.""","""['Carmela Ciccarelli', 'Agnese Di Rocco', 'Giovanni Luca Gravina', 'Annunziata Mauro', 'Claudio Festuccia', 'Andrea Del Fattore', 'Paolo Berardinelli', 'Francesca De Felice', 'Daniela Musio', 'Marina Bouché', 'Vincenzo Tombolini', 'Bianca Maria Zani', 'Francesco Marampon']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 affects in vitro and in vivo growth of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Down-regulation of c-Myc following MEK/ERK inhibition halts the expression of malignant phenotype in rhabdomyosarcoma and in non muscle-derived human tumors.', 'Key role of MEK/ERK pathway in sustaining tumorigenicity and in vitro radioresistance of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma stem-like cell population.', 'Nodal signaling promotes a tumorigenic phenotype in human breast cancer.', 'Molecular landscape of c-Myc signaling in prostate cancer: A roadmap to clinical translation.', 'Molecular mechanisms of tumor resistance to radiotherapy.', 'Radioresistance Mechanisms in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines Surviving Ultra-Hypo-Fractionated EBRT: Implications and Possible Clinical Applications.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Receptor-interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) stabilizes c-Myc and is a therapeutic target in prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Enhancing 223Ra Treatment Efficacy by Anti-β1 Integrin Targeting.']"""

Although UGT genes are highly clustered, the formation of chimeric transcripts by intergenic splicing between two or more UGT genes has not yet been reported. This study identified 12 chimeric transcripts (chimeras A-L) containing exons from two or three genes of the four neighboring UGT genes (UGT2B15, UGT2B29P2, UGT2B17, and UGT2B29P1) in human liver and prostate cancer cells. These chimeras typically contain the first five exons of UGT2B15 or UGT2B17 (exons 1-5) spliced to a terminal exon (exon 6) from a downstream UGT gene. Hence they encode truncated UGTs with novel C-terminal peptides. Functional assays of representative chimeric UGT proteins (termed chimeric UGT2B15 and chimeric UGT2B17) showed that they are inactive and can repress the activity of wild-type UGTs. Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated heterotypic interactions between chimeric UGT2B15 (or chimeric UGT2B17) and the UGT2B7 protein. Thus oligomerization of the chimeric UGTs with wild-type UGTs may explain their inhibitory activity. Studies in breast and prostate cancer cells showed that both wild-type and chimeric UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 transcripts are regulated in a similar way at the transcriptional level by sex hormones through their canonical promoters but are differentially regulated at the post-transcriptional level by micro-RNA 376c via their unique 3'-untranslated regions. In conclusion, the formation of chimeric transcripts by intergenic splicing among UGT genes represents a novel mechanism contributing to the diversity of the human UGT transcriptome and proteome. The differential post-transcriptional regulation of wild-type and variant transcripts by micro-RNAs may contribute to their deregulated expression in cancer.""","""['Dong Gui Hu', 'Julie-Ann Hulin', 'Dhilushi D Wijayakumara', 'Ross A McKinnon', 'Peter I Mackenzie', 'Robyn Meech']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Pharmacol""","""['Regulation of Human UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 by miR-376c in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Epigenetic regulation of steroid inactivating UDP-glucuronosyltransferases by microRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 by miR-331-5p in Prostate Cancer Cells Involves Canonical and Noncanonical Target Sites.', 'Transcriptional regulation of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase genes.', 'Multiple roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)2B15 and UGT2B17 enzymes in androgen metabolism and prostate cancer evolution.', 'The Somatic Mutation Landscape of UDP-Glycosyltransferase (UGT) Genes in Human Cancers.', 'Altered glucuronidation deregulates androgen dependent response profiles and signifies castration resistance in prostate cancer.']"""

Results:   Highest KLK15 levels were detected in the testis and seminal fluid, whereas lower levels were observed in prostate and other tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis of testis suggests that KLK15 is strongly expressed in mature spermatids, but not in immature germ cells. KLK15 displayed predominantly nuclear localization in the basal cell layer of the prostatic epithelium. We also measured KLK15 in supernatants of various cell lines.

It remains unknown whether this association reflects an increase in the incidence rates of extra-hepatic cancers in adolescents and younger.  Methods:   We examined 10 common extra-hepatic cancers (lung, breast, gastric, prostate, esophageal, rectal, cervical, nasopharyngeal, lymphatic, and urinary bladder) among patients diagnosed at three Chinese hospitals during 2007-2016. We compared the percentage distribution (frequencies at each age point are shown as a percentage of the total frequency) of HBsAg+ with HBsAg- patients, and calculated the standardized incidence ratio for each age group.  Results:   A total of 60,323 patients were identified. The mean age at cancer diagnosis was 1.5-5.5 years younger in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients compared to HBsAg- patients (p ≤ 0.001). Lymphoma patients had the highest prevalence rate of HBV infection (20.7%). Among the pooled HBsAg+ cancer patients, 14.8% (1138/7666) were aged ≤39 years; by contrast, 9.7% (5122/52657) of HBsAg- cancer patients were in the same age range, giving an odds ratio of 1.6 [95%CI1.509-1.733)]. The observations were similar when each cancer was considered individually. The odds ratio was greater in pooled male patients aged ≤39 years [1.9(95%CI1.705-2.085)] compared with females [1.6(95%CI1.382-1.83)].

IFS analysis of the urethra and bladder neck was performed, and if malignant or atypical cells remained, further resection with the aim of achieving histological negativity was carried out. Patients were divided into three groups according to the findings: those with a negative surgical margin (NSM), a positive surgical margin converted to negative (NCSM) and a persistent positive surgical margin (PSM).  Results:   Among the 2 013 patients, rates of NSMs, NCSMs and PSMs were 75.1%, 4.9%, and 20.0%, respectively.

We document cancer incidence patterns in 2012 among older adults globally, and examine the changing magnitude of cancer in this age group over the next decades. Using GLOBOCAN 2012 data, we presented the number and proportion of new cancer cases, and the truncated age-standardised incidence rates among adults aged 65 years and older for all cancer sites combined and for the five most common cancer sites by world region. We calculated the incidence in 2035 by applying population projections, assuming no changes in rates. In 2012, 6.7 million new cancer cases (47.5% of all cancers) were diagnosed among older adults worldwide, with marked regional disparities. Nearly 48% of these cases occurred in less developed regions. Lung, colorectal, prostate, stomach and breast cancers represented 55% of the global incidence, yet distinct regional patterns were observed. We predict 14 million new cancer cases by 2035, representing almost 60% of the global cancer incidence. The largest relative increase in incidence is predicted in the Middle East and Northern Africa (+157%), and in China (+155%). Less developed regions will see an increase of new cases by 144%, compared to 54% in more developed regions.

Aberrant activation of the TLR pathway has a significant impact on carcinogenesis or tumor progression. Therefore, we hypothesize that genetic variants in the TLR signaling pathway genes are associated with overall survival (OS) of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To test this hypothesis, we first performed Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to evaluate associations between genetic variants of 165 TLR signaling pathway genes and NSCLC OS using the genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). The results were further validated by the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility GWAS dataset. Specifically, we identified IRAK2 rs779901 C > T as a predictor of NSCLC OS, with a variant-allele (T) attributed hazards ratio (HR) of 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.67-0.91, P = 0.001] in the PLCO dataset, 0.84 (0.72-0.98, 0.031) in the Harvard dataset, and 0.81 (0.73-0.90, 1.08x10-4 ) in the meta-analysis of these two GWAS datasets.

Objective:   To determine the safety and efficacy of BIND-014, a PSMA-directed docetaxel-containing nanoparticle, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Design, setting, and participants:   A multicenter open-label, phase 2 clinical trial of 42 chemotherapy-naive patients with progressing mCRPC after treatment with abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide was conducted from June 24, 2013, to June 10, 2016.  Intervention:   Treatment with BIND-014 at a dosage of 60 mg/m2 was given intravenously on day 1 of 21-day cycles in combination with prednisone until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was radiographic progression-free survival according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 recommendations and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Secondary end points included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (≥50% reduction from baseline) and changes in CTC number (from ≥5 to <5 cells per 7.5 mL of blood) (CellSearch). Changes in CTC number based on PSMA expression levels on CTCs were also evaluated (Epic Sciences).  Results:   Among the 42 patients (81% white), the median age was 66 (range, 50-85) years, and median number of doses received was 6 (range, 1-21). A PSA response was observed in 12 of 40 patients (30%; 95% CI, 18%-45%), measurable disease response in 6 of 19 (32% [95% CI, 15%-54%]), and CTC conversions in 13 of 26 (50%; 95% CI, 32%-68%). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 9.9 (95% CI, 7.1-12.6) months. With use of the Epic Sciences non-EPCAM-based CTC detection platform, CTCs were detected in 16 of 18 patients (89%); 11 of 18 (61%) had CTCs with PSMA expression above the analytical threshold level (PSMA positive) at baseline (range, 0.4-72.4 CTCs/mL). After treatment, PSMA-positive CTCs were preferentially reduced. Treatment-related adverse events included grade 1 or 2 fatigue (29 of 42 patients [69%]), nausea (23 [55%]), neuropathy (14 [33%]), and neutropenic fever (1 [2%]).  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that treatment with BIND-014 is active and well tolerated in patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. Antitumor activity may be related to PSMA expression levels on CTCs, which suggests that patients who are likely to benefit from this treatment can be identified before treatment is initiated.

Genitourinary and gastrointestinal acute toxicity related to epithelial cell damage (hematuria, dysuria, proctitis, or mucus) were related to freedom from late biochemical failure (FFBF; nadir + 2). The validation cohort was from two separate institutions.  Results:   In all, 503 patients were included in the discovery cohort and 658 patients in the validation cohort. In the validation cohort, patients with acute radiation toxicity reflecting epithelial damage had a longer FFBF on both univariate (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37; P = .004) and multivariate (HR 0.45; P = .035) analysis. The impact of acute toxicity on late FFBF seemed to be greater in patients treated with androgen deprivation (HR 0.19) than in those without (HR 0.48).  Conclusion:   Patients reporting acute radiation toxicity reflective of epithelial cell damage during definitive radiation therapy for prostate cancer have significantly longer FFBF, consistent with an underlying genetic link between normal tissue and tumor radiosensitivity.""","""['Thomas Eade', 'Ananya Choudhury', 'Alan Pollack', 'Matthew Abramowitz', 'Felix M Chinea', 'Linxin Guo', 'Jason Kennedy', 'Sandra Louw', 'George Hruby', 'Andrew Kneebone', 'Catharine West']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Postoperative Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Conventional Versus Hypofractionated Radiation Regimens.', 'Late toxicity after intensity-modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: an exploration of dose-volume histogram parameters to limit genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity.', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Toxicity after external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: an analysis of late morbidity in men with diabetes mellitus.', 'Long-term results of an RTOG Phase II trial (00-19) of external-beam radiation therapy combined with permanent source brachytherapy for intermediate-risk clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'A Ten-year-long Update on Radiation Proctitis Among Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Curative External Beam Radiotherapy.']"""

The long-term clinical outcomes and overall prognosis of patients presenting with GS 10 PCa are largely unknown because of its rarity.  Methods and materials:   The study included 112 patients with biopsy-determined GS 10 PCa who received treatment with radical prostatectomy (RP, n = 26), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT, n = 48), or EBRT with a brachytherapy boost (EBRT-BT, n = 38) between 2000 and 2013. Propensity scores were included as covariates for comparative analysis. Overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method with inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for confounding.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 4.9 years overall (3.9 years for RP, 4.8 years for EBRT, and 5.7 years for EBRT-BT). Significantly more EBRT patients than EBRT-BT patients received upfront androgen deprivation therapy (98% vs 79%, P < .01 by χ2 test), though the durations were similar (median, 24 months vs 22.5 months). Of the RP patients, 34% received postoperative EBRT, and 35% received neoadjuvant systemic therapy. The propensity score-adjusted 5-year overall survival rate was 80% for the RP group, 73% for the EBRT group, and 83% for the EBRT-BT group. The corresponding adjusted 5-year prostate cancer-specific survival rates were 87%, 75%, and 94%, respectively. The EBRT-BT group trended toward superior DMFS when compared with the RP group (hazard ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval 0.1-1.06; P = .06) and had superior DMFS when compared with the EBRT group (hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.99; P = .048).  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the largest series ever reported on the clinical outcomes of patients with biopsy-determined GS 10 PCa. These data provide useful prognostic benchmark information for physicians and patients. Aggressive therapy with curative intent is warranted, as >50% of patients remain free of systemic disease 5 years after treatment.""","""['Kiri A Sandler', 'Ryan R Cook', 'Jay P Ciezki', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Mark M Pomerantz', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Talha Shaikh', 'Phuoc T Tran', 'Richard G Stock', 'Gregory S Merrick', 'D Jeffrey Demanes', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Eyad I Abu-Isa', 'Trude B Wedde', 'Wolfgang Lilleby', 'Daniel J Krauss', 'Grace K Shaw', 'Ridwan Alam', 'Chandana A Reddy', 'Daniel Y Song', 'Eric A Klein', 'Andrew J Stephenson', 'Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'John V Hegde', 'Sun Mi Yoo', 'Ryan Fiano', ""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'William J Aronson', 'Ahmad Sadeghi', 'Stephen C Greco', 'Curtiland Deville', 'Todd McNutt', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Jonathan W Said', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Patrick A Kupelian', 'Christopher R King', 'Amar U Kishan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Clinical Outcomes for Patients with Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Adenocarcinoma Treated With Radiotherapy or Radical Prostatectomy: A Multi-institutional Comparative Analysis.', 'Radical Prostatectomy, External Beam Radiotherapy, or External Beam Radiotherapy With Brachytherapy Boost and Disease Progression and Mortality in Patients With Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy With a Brachytherapy Boost Versus Radical Prostatectomy in Gleason Pattern 5 Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'A systematic review of randomized trials in localized prostate cancer.', 'Permanent interstitial low-dose-rate brachytherapy for patients with localised prostate cancer: a systematic review of randomised and nonrandomised controlled clinical trials.', 'A comparison between high dose rate brachytherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy boost after elective pelvic irradiation for high and very high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Biochemical failure and toxicity in treatment with brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy compared with radical prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer.', 'Radioactive Iodine-125 in Tumor Therapy: Advances and Future Directions.', 'Is Androgen Deprivation Therapy ""Another Deficient Therapy"" for Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Cancer?']"""

Cancer statistics obtained from specific regions populated by distinct ethnic groups may vary considerably. There is no national cancer registry. To determine whether there are indeed significant statistical differences in cancer incidence and prevalence, data was recorded from different parts of Pakistan based on the ethnic composition of the population in those parts.  Methods:   Ten papers (original articles) on cancer incidence and prevalence in Pakistan published in the last two decades were selected from PubMed and Google Scholar. Meta-analysis of findings of these studies was performed using Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) checklist. χ2-based I2 test was used for evaluating heterogeneity and Forest plots were generated for calculating unadjusted prevalence estimates. Oral, gastric, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers were selected for meta-analysis. I2 values of 75% or greater indicated high heterogeneity.  Results:   All five types of cancer selected for meta-analysis (performed on studies carrying similar statistical weights) showed extremely high heterogeneity with I2 values of 99.7% for oral cancer, 98.6% for prostate cancer, 98.3% for gastric cancer, 99.8% for breast cancer, and 85.4% for colorectal cancer. p values for all cancers were highly statistically significant.

As with other chronic conditions where exercise is indicated, it is uncertain if these services are being delivered in the health services. The aim of this multi-centre investigation was to examine what exercise referral is currently available for men on ADT as provided by the NHS and if a supervised, individually-tailored exercise training package (as per the national NICE guidelines CG175) is embedded within prostate cancer care.  Methods:   A multi-centre investigation of current National Health Service (NHS) care involving a web-based survey of NHS prostate cancer care, five focus groups involving 26 men on ADT and 37 semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in the management of prostate cancer. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis evaluated quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Qualitative methods followed COREQ standards.  Results:   HCPs and men on ADT asserted that medical castration has a serious and debilitating impact on many features of men's quality of life. There is support for exercise training programmes as part of cancer care and patients would support their initiation soon after diagnosis. Involving the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) is proposed as key to this. Critically, traditional values in oncology would need to be overcome for widespread acceptance. Specialist further training for HCPs around behaviour change support could encourage this. Given that these schemes are seen as a fundamental part of cancer care, it is felt the NHS should commission and support provision. 79 representatives of 154 NHS trusts (51%) provided survey data on current delivery: only 17% could provide supervised exercise as per CG175.  Conclusions:   Evidence-based national exercise guidelines are not being delivered to men on ADT as intended. Traditional values in oncology and the need for NHS financial support are seen as major barriers to provision of current best practice guidelines. Despite this both HCPs and men on ADT are in favour of such programmes being a fundamental part of their cancer care.""","""['Liam Bourke', 'Rebecca Turner', 'Rosa Greasley', 'Eileen Sutton', 'Liz Steed', 'Dianna Smith', 'Janet Brown', 'Ben Kelly', 'Claire Hulme', 'Diana Greenfield', 'Raj Persad', 'Amanda Farrin', 'Jenny Hewison', 'Derek J Rosario;STAMINA investigators']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Exercise as a supportive care strategy in men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy at a regional cancer centre: a survey of patients and clinicians.', '""Kicked out into the real world"": prostate cancer patients\' experiences with transitioning from hospital-based supervised exercise to unsupervised exercise in the community.', 'The role of exercise in the management of adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a rapid review.', 'The development of a theory and evidence-based intervention to aid implementation of exercise into the prostate cancer care pathway with a focus on healthcare professional behaviour, the STAMINA trial.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Notably, these KLKs are upregulated in prostate cancer and are used as clinical biomarkers or have been proposed as therapeutic targets. However, this potential awaits a detailed characterization of these proteases. In order to study glycosylated prostatic KLKs resembling the natural proteases, we used Leishmania (LEXSY) and HEK293 cells for secretory expression. Both systems allowed the subsequent purification of soluble pro-KLK zymogens with correct propeptides and of the mature forms. Periodic acid-Schiff reaction, enzymatic deglycosylation assays, and mass spectrometry confirmed the glycosylation of these KLKs. Activation of glycosylated pro-KLKs 4 and 11 turned out to be most efficient by glycosylated KLK2 and KLK4, respectively. By comparing the glycosylated prostatic KLKs with their non-glycosylated counterparts from Escherichia coli, it was observed that the N-glycans stabilize the KLK proteases and change their activation profiles and their enzymatic activity to some extent. The functional role of glycosylation in prostate-specific KLKs could pave the way to a deeper understanding of their biology and to medical applications.""","""['Shihui Guo', 'Peter Briza', 'Viktor Magdolen', 'Hans Brandstetter', 'Peter Goettig']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biol Chem""","""['Sweetened kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs): glycan trees as potential regulators of activation and activity.', 'Activation profiles and regulatory cascades of the human kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'Interdependence of kallikrein-related peptidases in proteolytic networks.', 'Activation of hepatocyte growth factor activator zymogen (pro-HGFA) by human kallikrein 1-related peptidases.', 'Seminal fluid characterization for male fertility and prostate cancer: kallikrein-related serine proteases and whole proteome approaches.', 'The Fluorescent Enzyme Cascade Detects Low Abundance Protein Modifications Suitable for the Assembly of Functionally Annotated Modificatome Databases.', 'Remodelling of the tumour microenvironment by the kallikrein-related peptidases.', 'Prostate-specific antigen glycoprofiling as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of prostate cancer.']"""

The authors previously demonstrated poor rates of biochemical disease control for patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) intermediate-risk disease using partial gland treatment with brachytherapy. The objective of the current study was to estimate the rates of distant metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) for this cohort.  Methods:   Between 1997 and 2007, a total of 354 men with clinical T1c disease, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level < 15 ng/mL, and Gleason grade ≤3 + 4 prostate cancer underwent partial prostate treatment with brachytherapy to the peripheral zone under 0.5-Tesla magnetic resonance guidance. The cumulative incidences of metastasis and PCSM for the NCCN very low-risk, low-risk, and intermediate-risk groups were estimated. Fine and Gray competing risk regression was used to evaluate clinical factors associated with time to metastasis.  Results:   A total of 22 patients developed metastases at a median of 11.0 years (interquartile range, 6.9-13.9 years). The 12-year metastasis rates for patients with very low-risk, low-risk, and intermediate-risk disease were 0.8% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.1%-4.4%), 8.7% (95% CI, 3.4%-17.2%), and 15.7% (95% CI, 5.7%-30.2%), respectively, and the 12-year PCSM estimates were 1.6% (95% CI, 0.1%-7.6%), 1.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-6.8%), and 8.2% (95% CI, 1.9%-20.7%), respectively.

Methods:   One hundred forty-two surgically treated patients with MESCC were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter North American cohort study and were followed for 12 months or until death. Cox regression was used. Noncollinear predictors with < 10% missing data, with ≥ 10 events per stratum, and with P < .05 in a univariate analysis were tested through a backward stepwise selection. For the original and revised Tokuhashi prognostic scoring systems (PSSs), Tomita PSS, modified Bauer PSS, van der Linden PSS, Bartels model, Oswestry Spinal Risk Index, and Bollen PSS, this study examined calibration graphically, discrimination with Harrell c-statistics, and survival stratified by risk groups with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test.  Results:   The following were significant in the univariate analysis: type of primary tumor, sex, organ metastasis, body mass index, preoperative radiotherapy to MESCC, physical component (PC) of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36v2), and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) Questionnaire. Breast, prostate and thyroid primary tumor (HR: 2.9; P =.0005), presence of organ metastasis (hazard ratio (HR): 2.0; P = .005) and SF-36v2 PC (HR: 0.95; P < .0001) were associated with survival in multivariable analysis.

However, the variation in reported Ktrans values between studies from different institutes is large. One of the primary sources of uncertainty is quantification of the arterial input function (AIF). The aim of this study is to determine the influence of the CA injection duration on the AIF and tracer kinetic analysis (TKA) parameters (i.e. Ktrans , kep and ve ). Thirty-one patients with prostate cancer received two DCE-MRI examinations with an injection duration of 5 s in the first examination and a prolonged injection duration in the second examination, varying between 7.5 s and 30 s. The DCE examination was carried out on a 3.0 T MRI scanner using a transversal T1 -weighted 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence (300 s duration, dynamic scan time of 2.5 s). Data of 29 of the 31 were further analysed. AIFs were determined from the phase signal in the left and right femoral arteries.

Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance of MYPT1 expression and its functions in PCa.  Methods:   Roles of MYPT1 deregulation in tumor angiogenesis of PCa was determined in vitro and in vivo experiments. Expression patterns of MYPT1 and CD31 proteins were examined by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, respectively. Associations of MYPT1/CD31 combination with various clinicopathological features and patients' prognosis of PCa were also statistically evaluated.  Results:   Through gain- and loss-of-function experiments, MYPT1 inhibited capillary tube formation of endothelial cells and in vivo tumor angiogenesis in a mouse model with the downregulation of VEGF and CD31 expression. In addition, MYPT1 expression was significantly decreased, while CD31 expression was dramatically increased in PCa tissues compared to benign prostate tissues. Notably, MYPT1 expression levels in PCa tissues were negatively correlated with that of CD31. Statistically, MYPT1-low/CD31- high expression was distinctly associated with high Gleason score, positive biochemical recurrence, and reduced overall survival of PCa patients. Moreover, PCa patients with MYPT1-low/CD31-high expression more frequently had shorter overall, biochemical recurrence-free and metastasis-free survivals. MYPT1/CD31 combination was identified as an independent factor to predict biochemical recurrence-free and metastasis-free survivals of PCa patients.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that MYPT1 may inhibit angiogenesis and contribute favorable prognosis in PCa patients, implying that MYPT1 might be a potential drug candidate in anticancer therapy.""","""['Y Liang', 'Y Zhuo', 'Z Lin', 'F Jiang', 'Q Dai', 'J Lu', 'W Dong', 'X Zhu', 'Z Han', 'W Zhong']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Curr Mol Med""","""['MicroRNA-30d promotes angiogenesis and tumor growth via MYPT1/c-JUN/VEGFA pathway and predicts aggressive outcome in prostate cancer.', 'HMGCS2 functions as a tumor suppressor and has a prognostic impact in prostate cancer.', 'miR-195 Inhibits Tumor Progression by Targeting RPS6KB1 in Human Prostate Cancer.', ""MicroRNA as new tools for prostate cancer risk assessment and therapeutic intervention: results from clinical data set and patients' samples."", 'Angiogenesis Inhibition in Prostate Cancer: An Update.', 'MYPT1 inhibits the metastasis of renal clear cell carcinoma via the MAPK8/N-cadherin pathway.', 'Identification and Validation of a PPP1R12A-Related Five-Gene Signature Associated With Metabolism to Predict the Prognosis of Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'The ALDOA Metabolism Pathway as a Potential Target for Regulation of Prostate Cancer Proliferation.', 'Water-Pipe Smoking Exposure Deregulates a Set of Genes Associated with Human Head and Neck Cancer Development and Prognosis.', 'Combination of Astragali Polysaccharide and Curcumin Improves the Morphological Structure of Tumor Vessels and Induces Tumor Vascular Normalization to Inhibit the Growth of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

The aims were to promote the reorganization of genitourinary cancer care, switching to a multidisciplinary approach, reach a consensus on the core elements for the setup of MDTs in genitourinary oncology, and support health policy makers and managers in remodeling of the assistance and care of uro-oncologic patients on a national level.  Results:   The first activity was the setup of 5 working groups, given the task of exploring selected topics: general principles, organization of MDTs, minimal requirements, economic evaluation, and relations with authorities. The groups participated in the writing of a document that was approved by the scientific societies and published on their web sites. Moreover, a few items summarizing the extensive document were approved in the first MDT Consensus Conference held in Milan in December 2015.

This study explores how peer support workers interpret and define the activities, responsibilities and knowledge associated with their work. Using methods of membership categorisation analysis, we analysed interview materials generated by conducting individual semi-structured interviews during the autumn of 2016 with prostate cancer peer support workers (n = 11) who currently volunteer as support workers in Finland. Although the peer support workers acknowledged the psychosocial aspects of the work, we argue that their interpretations extend far beyond this and encompass expertise, advocacy and activism as central features of their work. These can be used to strengthen their position as credible commentators and educators on issues relating to cancer and men's health; raise awareness and represent the 'patient's voice' and attempt to influence both policy and clinical practice. These findings suggest that by categorising their work activities in different ways, voluntary sector actors such as peer support workers can attempt to portray themselves as legitimate authorities on a range of issues and influence decision-making ranging from individual level treatment decisions all the way to health policy.""","""['Marjaana Jones', 'Ilkka Pietilä']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Health (London)""","""['Alignments and differentiations: People with illness experiences seeking legitimate positions as health service developers and producers.', 'A qualitative study of roles performed by peer workers in the context of HIV in India.', 'Peer support during pregnancy and early parenthood: a qualitative study of models and perceptions.', 'New ways of working in mental health services: a qualitative, comparative case study assessing and informing the emergence of new peer worker roles in mental health services in England.', 'Effectiveness and experiences of families and support workers participating in peer-led parenting support programs delivered as home visiting programs: a comprehensive systematic review.', 'Supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer after hospital discharge: multi-stakeholder perspectives.', 'An International Study Exploring the Experience of Survivors of Critical Illness as Volunteers Within ICU Recovery Services.', ""Development of cancer support services for patients and their close ones from the Cancer Society of Finland's perspective.""]"""

It is one of the most common indications for referral to an urologist. There's no consensus about what to do in PSA elevation management. Antibiotics, nutraceuticals or anti-inflammatories are commonly prescribed in daily practice. Our objective was to verify the effect on the PSA value of a short 30-day trial of a curcuma extract, than to discuss the implications in terms of reducing the number of prostate biopsies performed.  Patients and methods:   We enrolled 50 consecutive patients admitted at our attention for a first PSA over the level of 4 ng/ml or for a suspected PSA rising defined as PSA velocity (PSAv) > 0.75 ng/ml/years. They received treatment with curcuma extract, 2 tablets per day for 30 day. All patients received a second PSA measurement and TRUS within 6 days from the end of the therapy. In case of PSA reduction below 4 ng/ml, patients were reassured and invited to repeat a PSA control over the time. When PSA level were persistently high over 4 ng/ml or in case of any rising, patients underwent a transrectal ultrasound guided 12-core prostatic biopsy (TRUSbx).  Results:   Mean age of the patients was 64.56 ± 8.88 (range, 42- 81 years). Prostate volume was 48.34 ± 15,77 ml (range, 18-80 ml). At visit 1, PSA value was in mean 6,84 ± 3.79 ng/ml (range 2.93-21ng/ml). Consequently, mean PSA density value was 0.16 ± 0.16 (range 0.05-1.11). PSA free and PSA total ratio at baseline was 16.85 ± 3.9% (range 8-26%). At visit 2, the prostate volume did not change. Total PSA was 4.65 ± 2,67 ng/ml (range 1-16.82 ng/ml). PSA free and PSA total ratio (PSAF/T) after treatment was 19.68 ± 5.35 % (range 7.8-29%). The differences of total PSA and PSAF/T between visit 1 and visit 2 were < 0.0001 and p < 0.0036, respectively. We performed 26 TRUSbx. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 6 cases, PIN HG in 2 cases and non neoplastic findings in the remnants 18 patients.  Conclusions:   Use of the Curcuma extract is able to lower the PSA value after a 30-day intake period.

Objective:   To assess the clinical utility of tNGS in treatment decision-making for patients with mPCa.  Patients and methods:   Patients with available genomic profiling using tumor tissue (FoundationOne, F1) or cell-free DNA (FoundationACT, Guardant360) were included. Targetable genomic alterations (tGA) included a change in the copy number or mutations in DNA repair genes, mismatch repair genes, PTEN, cyclin-dependent kinases, ERBB2, BRAF, TSC, and the PIK3/mTOR pathway.  Results:   The study included 66 patients, 86% of which had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and who had received a median of 3 (range 0-7) treatments prior to tNGS. The most frequent alterations were found in TP53 (42%), PTEN (35%), androgen receptor (AR) (30%), DNA repair (30%), PIK3CA signaling pathway (21%), cyclin-dependent kinases (15%), BRAF (9%), and MMR/MSI (6%) genes.

MP-MRI in combination with transperineal template mapping biopsy has facilitated the development of the concept of targeted biopsies, either cognitively or with software fusion. Urinary retention is a recognised complication of transperineal prostate biopsy, with reported incidence being 1.6-11.4%. We present patient and procedure-related factors, which influence occurrence of urinary retention after transperineal template biopsy.  Patients and methods:   Retrospective data collection of 243 consecutive cases of transperineal template biopsies performed at a single institution were recorded and analysed. Biopsies were taken using a standard 5-mm template in 4-6 sectors, depending on the prostate volume.  Results:   31/243 (12.8%) patients developed urinary retention, defined as patient discomfort and inability to micturate and bladder scan of ≥ 600 ml. Patients in the retention group were significantly older (mean 68.7 vs. 65.8 years, P = 0.034). Prostate volume was significantly greater in comparison with the non-retention group (mean 75.4 vs. 57.2 cc, P = 0.0016). The number of biopsies taken was positively correlated with urinary retention (median 35 vs. 32 biopsies, P = 0.045), and this was independent of prostate size (R2 = 0.2). Presenting PSA, pre-operative flow and histopathological outcome were independent of urinary retention.  Conclusions:   Factors resulting in an increased risk of urinary retention are advancing age (> 68.7 years); a larger prostate volume (> 75 cc); greater number of biopsies (> 35); greater severity of lower urinary tract symptoms prior to biopsy and diabetes.

The cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors depends on PARP trapping, the formation of non-covalent protein-DNA adducts composed of inhibited PARP1 bound to DNA lesions of unclear origins1-4. To address the nature of such lesions and the cellular consequences of PARP trapping, we undertook three CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats) screens to identify genes and pathways that mediate cellular resistance to olaparib, a clinically approved PARP inhibitor1. Here we present a high-confidence set of 73 genes, which when mutated cause increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. In addition to an expected enrichment for genes related to homologous recombination, we discovered that mutations in all three genes encoding ribonuclease H2 sensitized cells to PARP inhibition.

GREB1 (Growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1) is an ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1)-upregulated protein which may mediate estrogen action. GREB1 knockdown prevents hormone-driven proliferation of several breast and prostate cancer cell lines and prolongs survival of mice engrafted with ovarian cancer cells, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we explored GREB1 function in ovarian cancer. GREB1 overexpression in ovarian cancer cell lines increased cell proliferation and migration and promoted a mesenchymal morphology associated with increased Col1a2, which encodes a collagen I subunit. GREB1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and promoted an epithelial morphology associated with decreased Col1a2. In human tissues, GREB1 was expressed in all ESR1-expressing tissues throughout the normal female reproductive tract, in addition to several tissues that did not show ESR1 expression. In a TMA of ovarian cancer cases, GREB1 was expressed in 75-85% of serous, endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas. Serous, endometrioid, and mucinous ovarian cancers were almost always positive for either ESR1 or GREB1, suggesting a possible reliance on signalling through ESR1 and/or GREB1.

However, many studies do not take into account that 2-DG inhibits not only glycolysis but also N-glycosylation. Since there are limited publications on 2-DG mechanism of action in breast cancer, we studied its effects in breast cancer cell lines to determine the part played by glycolysis inhibition and N-linked glycosylation interference.  Methods and results:   2-Deoxyglucose behaved as an anticancer agent with a similar efficiency on cell number decrease between the hormone-dependent MCF-7 and hormone-independent MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. It also interfered with the N-linked glycosylation process in both cell lines as illustrated by the migration profile of the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 and calumenin. These results are reinforced by the appearance of an abnormal Man7GlcNAc2 structure both on lipid-linked oligosaccharides and N-linked glycoproteins of 2-DG incubated MDA-MB-231 cells. Besides, 2-DG-induced a transient endoplasmic reticulum stress that was more sustained in MDA-MB-231 cells. Both changes were abrogated by mannose. 2-DG, even in the presence of mannose, decreased glycolysis in both cell lines. Mannose partially reversed the effects of 2-DG on cell numbers with N-linked glycosylation interference accounting for 37 and 47% of 2-DG anti-cancerous effects in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, respectively.

Then, for each beam configuration, the intensity profile is calculated by the conjugate gradient method to score each beam angle set chosen. A simulated phantom case with obvious optimal beam angles was used to benchmark the validity of the presented algorithm. Two clinical cases (TG-119 phantom and prostate cases) were examined to prepare a dose volume histogram (DVH) and determine the dose distribution to evaluate efficiency of the algorithm. A clinical plan with the optimized beam configuration was compared with an equiangular plan to determine the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The BAO plans yielded significant improvements in the DVHs and dose distributions compared to the equispaced coplanar beams for each case.

This method requires a combination of irradiated fibroblast feeder cells and a Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. In the present study, we demonstrate increased levels of full-length p53 and its natural isoform, Δ133p53α, in conditionally reprogrammed epithelial cells from primary prostate, foreskin, ectocervical, and mammary tissues. Increased Δ133p53α expression is critical for CR since cell proliferation is rapidly inhibited following siRNA knockdown of endogenous Δ133p53α. Importantly, overexpression of Δ133p53α consistently delays the onset of cellular senescence of primary cells when cultured under non-CR conditions in normal keratinocyte growth medium (KGM). More significantly, the combination of Δ133p53α overexpression and ROCK inhibitor, without feeder cells, enables primary epithelial cells to be propagated long-term in vitro. We also show that Δ133p53α overexpression induces hTERT expression and telomerase activity and that siRNA knockdown of hTERT causes rapid inhibition of cell proliferation, indicating a critical role of hTERT for mediating the effects of Δ133p53α.

Variation of the CYP3A5*3 (rs776746 A > G) can lead to oxidation and inactivation of testosterone, which may result in individual susceptibility to prostate cancer.  Methods:   All eligible published studies about association between CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk were searched in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, for the period up to August 2015. Odds ratios (ORs) together with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to access the strength of the association.  Results:   Six case-control studies including 2522 cancer patients and 2444 healthy controls were finally included. The meta-analysis results suggested that CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms were significantly associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer under two genetic models (GG + AG vs. AA: OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.23-1.90, P = 0.000; GG vs. AA: OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.14-1.87, P = 0.000). Further subgroup analysis according to ethnicity indicated that CYP3A5*3 polymorphism may increase the risks of prostate cancer among African (G allele vs. A allele: OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.14-1.57, P = 0.000; GG + AG vs. AA: OR = 1.606, 95% CI = 1.27-2.04, P = 0.000). Sensitivity analysis indicated a reliable result and publication bias suggested no strong publication bias under the genetic models.

Then, the DEN including the differential interactions and the nondifferential interactions were constructed, and the hub genes were determined according to degree centrality analysis of nodes. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis was conducted on these genes contained in the DEN to further to determine the importance of the hub genes.

Doses were corrected to 2 Gy/fraction using the linear-quadratic model and applying alpha/beta ratio = 4.8 Gy.  Results:   228 patients constituted the validation population. A mean FI grade >1 was scored in 25 patients (11%). Logistic regression confirmed risk factors reported in the literature, with similar odds ratios (ORs) for Dmean (1.04 ± 0.03 vs 1.06 ± 0.04) and SURG (1.9 ± 1.7 vs 1.6 ± 1.45); COLO was not confirmed. Consequently, the predictive models including Dmean/Dmean + SURG were evaluated using calibration plots. Both showed a clear discriminative trend, but the absolute observed toxicity rates were underestimated (ie, absolute predicted rates were always lower than corresponding absolute observed rates). This result was consistent with an unexpected effect of hypofractionation (OR = 2.20, conventional = 8.1% vs hypofractionated = 17.4%) beyond the standard correction using linear-quadratic model. Nevertheless, the FI rate in the conventionally treated group was almost double the rate observed in the previously studied cohort (4.3% vs 8.1%).  Conclusions:   The study confirms previously published results indicating that abdominal surgery and rectal mean dose are risk factors for late FI. Calibration plots highlight a possible role of hypofractionation beyond linear-quadratic correction.""","""['Alessandro Cicchetti', 'Barbara Avuzzi', 'Federica Palorini', 'Francesca Ballarini', 'Claudio Stucchi', 'Giovanni Fellin', 'Pietro Gabriele', 'Vittorio Vavassori', 'Claudio Degli Esposti', 'Cesare Cozzarini', 'Claudio Fiorino', 'Tiziana Rancati', 'Riccardo Valdagni']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['In Regard to Cicchetti et\xa0al.', 'In Reply to Loganadane et\xa0al.', 'Patterns in ano-rectal dose maps and the risk of late toxicity after prostate IMRT.', 'Nomogram to predict rectal toxicity following prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Hypofractionation with VMAT versus 3DCRT in post-operative patients with prostate cancer.', 'Higher-than-expected severe (Grade 3-4) late urinary toxicity after postprostatectomy hypofractionated radiotherapy: a single-institution analysis of 1176 patients.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Modelling Radiation-Induced Salivary Dysfunction during IMRT and Chemotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Cancer Patients.', 'Enteric-Coated Strategies in Colorectal Cancer Nanoparticle Drug Delivery System.', 'Local Dose Effects for Late Gastrointestinal Toxicity After Hypofractionated and Conventionally Fractionated Modern Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer in the HYPRO Trial.']"""

We examined the Arg1-positive cells in tumor microenvironment of gastric carcinomas (GCs), colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) and prostate carcinomas (PCs), and analyzed their clinicopathological significance. Immunohistochemical staining for Arg1 was done in 60 GCs, 38 gastric adenomas, 40 CRCs, 10 colonic adenomas, 36 PCs, and 15 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Arg1 expression was predominantly localized in tumor microenvironment and the stroma of nonneoplastic tissues. Cells with Arg1 expression were mostly leukocytes, morphologically resembling polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and showed CD15 expression. Arg1 expression was focally expressed in cancer cells of 6 PCs, but not in those of GCs and CRCs. Arg1-positive cells were significantly more infiltrated in tumors than adenomas and nonneoplastic tissues, such as BPH, intestinal metaplasia and adjacent tissues. There were no significant findings between them and clinicopathological parameters, except for the relationship to gender and tumor differentiation in CRCs.

A system for automated multi-criterial planning has been validated for this treatment in a large international multi-center study. The system is configured with training plans using a mechanism that strives for quality improvements relative to those plans.  Material and methods:   Each of the four participating centers included thirty manually generated clinical Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy prostate plans (manVMAT). Ten plans were used for autoplanning training. The other twenty were compared with an automatically generated plan (autoVMAT). Plan evaluations considered dosimetric plan parameters and blinded side-by-side plan comparisons by clinicians.  Results:   With equivalent Planning Target Volume (PTV) V95%, D2%, D98%, and dose homogeneity autoVMAT was overall superior for rectum with median differences of 3.4 Gy (p < 0.001) in Dmean, 4.0% (p < 0.001) in V60Gy, and 1.5% (p = 0.001) in V75Gy, and for bladder Dmean (0.9 Gy, p < 0.001). Also the clinicians' plan comparisons pointed at an overall preference for autoVMAT. Advantages of autoVMAT were highly treatment center- and patient-specific with overall ranges for differences in rectum Dmean and V60Gy of [-4,12] Gy and [-2,15]%, respectively.  Conclusion:   Observed advantages of autoplanning were clinically relevant and larger than reported in the literature. The latter is likely related to the multi-criterial nature of the applied autoplanning algorithm, with for each center a dedicated configuration that aims at plan improvements relative to its (clinical) training plans.

China is a vast country with significant geographical differences in population structure and healthcare, and thus provides a unique opportunity to analyze the complex relationship between life expectancy and cancer incidence and mortality rates.  Methods:   Cancer data were extracted for a total of 255 units (cities or counties) from the 2013 National Central Cancer Registry. Life expectancy data at the unit level were obtained from the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Linear regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between life expectancy and crude incidence and mortality rates of cancer. In a separate analysis, life expectancy was rated as low (< 76.0 years), middle (76-80 years), or high (> 80 years).  Results:   Overall, the cancer incidence and mortality rates positively correlated with life expectancy in both sexes (R at 0.37 and 0.50, P < 0.001). The correlation was significant for the following cancers: lung, colorectal, prostate, bladder and pancreas, as well as for lymphoma in men (R 0.36-0.58, P < 0.001), lung, breast, colorectal, thyroid, uterus, and ovary in women (R 0.18-0.51, P < 0.001). We failed to observe an association between upper gastrointestinal cancer and life expectancy. The number of cities/counties with low, middle and high life expectancy levels were 110, 101 and 44, respectively. The highest age-standardized cancer incidence rate was observed in areas with a high life expectancy level (192.83/100,000). The highest age-standardized mortality rate was in areas with the lowest life expectancy (118.44/100,000). Cancers of the stomach, liver and esophagus are major cancer types in areas with low and middle life expectancy. In contrast, areas with high life expectancy had high incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer, breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men.  Conclusions:   Longer life expectancy is associated with higher overall cancer incidence and mortality in China. The cancer pattern also varies substantially across areas with different life expectancy levels. Life expectancy levels must be considered when developing strategies to prevent and treat cancers.""","""['Xiuying Gu', 'Rongshou Zheng', 'Changfa Xia', 'Hongmei Zeng', 'Siwei Zhang', 'Xiaonong Zou', 'Zhixun Yang', 'He Li', 'Wanqing Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Commun (Lond)""","""['Report of Cancer Incidence and Mortality in China, 2014.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality in Zhejiang Province, Southeast China, 2016: a population-based study.', 'Incidence and mortality of cancers appeared in the Hebei provincial cancer registry system in 2011.', 'A diversity of cancer incidence and mortality in West Asian populations.', 'Common cancers in the elderly.', 'Effects of stigma, anxiety and depression, and uncertainty in illness on quality of life in patients with prostate cancer: a cross-sectional analysis.', ""Benefits of Dynamic Nomogram Models for Elderly Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Patients' Early Death Prediction and Clinical Application."", 'The influence of axillary surgery and radiotherapeutic strategy on the risk of lymphedema and upper extremity dysfunction in early breast cancer patients.', 'Post-chemotherapy pneumonia in Chinese patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Outcomes and predictive model.', 'Large-Scale Single-Cell and Bulk Sequencing Analyses Reveal the Prognostic Value and Immune Aspects of CD147 in Pan-Cancer.']"""

NAT1 expression has been associated with the estrogen receptor and it has been proposed as a prognostic marker for estrogen receptor positive cancers. However, little is known about the distribution of NAT1 mRNA across an entire patient population or its effects on outcomes. To address this, gene expression data from breast cancer patient cohorts were investigated to identify sub-populations based on the level of NAT1 expression. Patient survival and drug response was examined to determine whether NAT1 mRNA levels influenced any of these parameters.  Results:   NAT1 expression showed a trimodal distribution in breast cancer samples (n = 1980) but not in tumor tissue from ovarian, prostate, cervical or colorectal cancers. In breast cancer, NAT1 mRNA in each sub-population correlated with a separate set of genes suggesting different mechanisms of NAT1 gene regulation. Kaplan-Meier plots showed significantly better survival in patients with highest NAT1 mRNA compared to those with intermediate or low expression. While NAT1 expression was elevated in estrogen receptor-positive patients, it did not appear to be dependent on estrogen receptor expression. Overall survival was analyzed in patients receiving no treatment, hormone therapy or chemotherapy. NAT1 expression correlated strongly with survival in the first 5 years in those patients receiving chemotherapy but did not influence survival in the other two groups. This suggests that low NAT1 expression is associated with chemo-resistance. The sensitivity of NAT1 mRNA levels as a single parameter to identify non-responders to chemotherapy was 0.58 at a log(2) < 6.5.  Conclusions:   NAT1 mRNA can be used to segregate breast cancer patients into sub-populations that demonstrate different overall survival. Moreover, low NAT1 expression shows a distinct poor response to chemotherapy. Analysis of NAT1 expression may be useful for identifying specific individuals who would benefit from alternative therapy or drug combinations. However, additional information is required to increase the sensitivity of identifying non-responders.""","""['Rodney F Minchin', 'Neville J Butcher']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Immunohistochemical determination of the miR-1290 target arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) as a prognostic biomarker in breast cancer.', 'High N-Acetyltransferase 1 Expression Is Associated with Estrogen Receptor Expression in Breast Tumors, but Is not Under Direct Regulation by Estradiol, 5α-androstane-3β,17β-Diol, or Dihydrotestosterone in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 expression in breast cancer cell lines: a potential marker in estrogen receptor-positive tumors.', 'Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1: a drug-metabolizing enzyme and a drug target?', 'Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1: a novel drug target in cancer development.', 'Identification of lymph node metastasis-related genes and patterns of immune infiltration in colon adenocarcinoma.', 'Upregulation of cytidine deaminase in NAT1 knockout breast cancer cells.', 'Assessment of genetic susceptibility to multiple primary cancers through whole-exome sequencing in two large multi-ancestry studies.', 'Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 deficiency inhibits drug-induced cell death in breast cancer cells: switch from cytochrome C-dependent apoptosis to necroptosis.', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase 1 Activity is Regulated by the Protein Acetylation Status.']"""

A significant proportion of patients undergoing RARP are on antiplatelet medications for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. However, there is still a relative lack of data with regard to the advantages and complications of continuing these medications through surgery.  Materials and methods:   Our usual protocol of RARP entails continuation of low-dose aspirin (75 mg once a day) for patients who are already on antiplatelet agents. We conducted a retrospective audit of a prospectively maintained database of 116 cases of RARP performed by a single surgical team in 1 year. Patients were divided into low-dose aspirin group (AG) (n = 31) and nonaspirin group (NAG) (n = 85). The primary objective was to compare the 90-day complication rates to assess the safety profile. Secondary objective was to compare perioperative parameters such as estimated blood loss, blood transfusion rates, fall in hemoglobin (Hb) level, drain outputs on day 1, days to drain removal, lymph node yield, and margin positivity. Subgroup comparison was performed between patients on aspirin for primary prevention (n = 15) and NAG.  Results:   Both groups were well matched for preoperative parameters except for significantly higher comorbidities and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score class in AG. Console time, blood loss, fall in Hb level, drain output, drain and catheter removal days, day of discharge, and lymph node yield were comparable. Margin positivity was significantly higher in NAG. Ninety-day complication rates were not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.218) with only one major complication (Clavien-Dindo grade 4 hypotension requiring intensive care unit admission) in AG. Subgroup comparison demonstrated similar outcomes.

The means of assessing outcome in the clinic are inaccurate, and there is a pressing need to more precisely identify men at risk of aggressive PC. We previously identified HIST1H1A as a susceptibility gene for aggressive PC. HIST1H1A encodes H1.1, a member of the linker histone family that is involved in chromatin organization and compaction. To understand the molecular basis of aggressive PC, we have characterized how germline variation modulates susceptibility to neuroendocrine differentiation, which is a form of aggressive PC. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that HIST1H1A is over-expressed in normal human prostate tissue compared to prostate adenocarcinoma. Functional characterization of HIST1H1A in prostate LNCaP cells indicated that HIST1HA over-expression increased cell growth, as well as the expression of neuroendocrine and epithelial-to-mesenchymal markers in vitro. Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq), which is used to assess chromatin compaction and thus the transcriptional availability of individual genomic regions, demonstrated that H1.1 plays a prominent role in modulating Wnt signaling pathway genes, which are implicated in prostate tumorigenesis.

Methods:   A descriptive population study of cancer incidence and mortality in the Metropolitan Area of ​​Bucaramanga was conducted. Primary invasive cancer cases from the 2008-2012 period was obtained from the RPC-AMB base. Population and death data were provided by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE, for its initials in Spanish). Crude rates of global and specific incidence and mortality were estimated by sex, and standardized incidence and mortality rates.  Results:   During the five-year period, 8,775 incidents of cancer were recorded (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer). The global standardized incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were 151.7 in men and 157.2 in women. The main locations were prostate, stomach and colorectal, in men; breast, thyroid and colorectal in women. The standardized mortality rate per 100,000 person-years was 94.8 in men and 78.0 in women.

Methods:   During the period 2008-2012, 23,046 new cases were registered and during 2011-2015 there were 12,761 cancer deaths. The trend of the rates was described with the APC average annual change rate and with the Joinpoint analysis. We analyzed the individual data of 38,671 adults (15-99 years) diagnosed with cancer between 1995-2009, and we calculated the standardized net survival by age for the 14 most common cancer body sites, using the Pohar-Perme method.  Results:   Prostate and breast cancer were the first cause of cancer morbidity. The incidence rates in these were susceptible to early detection, tumors stabilized after decades of growth, while an increase in the incidence of colon cancer and papillary thyroid carcinoma was observed. The incidence rates of cervical and stomach cancer and conditions related to infectious agents decreased, although the number of absolute cases increased, due to the growth and aging of the population. Gastric cancer was responsible for the highest number of cancer related deaths. The types of cancer related to tobacco consumption (lung, oral cavity, esophagus, pancreas, urinary bladder) showed low numbers and a tendency to decrease. During the period 2000-2004, the 5-year net survival improved for cancers of the breast, cervix, prostate, melanoma and thyroid, although in the period 2005-2009 a stagnation was observed. In stomach, liver and lung cancer, the 5-year net survival was less than 15%. The 5-year overall survival in children was 51.0% (95% CI: 47.5, 54.3) and in adolescents 44.6% (95% CI: 36.0, 52.8).

Although radium-223 has a positive effect on OS in men with mCRPC, there has been a paucity of reports from community practitioners, especially with regard to concurrent abiraterone and enzalutamide therapy. Significant differences in patient characteristics encountered may exist.  Patients and methods:   We conducted a retrospective study of men with mCRPC who received at least 1 cycle of radium-223 (n = 35). Baseline pain and ECOG PS as well as concurrent usage of abiraterone or enzalutamide were recorded. Side effect profiles for each patient throughout treatment were noted.  Results:   Baseline cohort characteristics include a median age of 75 years. 37% had an ECOG PS ≥ 2 and 23% reported severe pain at baseline. 31% received concomitant enzalutamide 31% concomitant abiraterone. Patients treated concurrently with either abiraterone or enzalutamide did not display additional toxicity. Median cohort OS was 10 months. Patients with no or mild pain had longer median OS than those with moderate or severe pain, 14 versus 7 months (P = 0.028). Patients with ECOG PS < 2 had longer median OS than those with ECOG PS ≥ 2, 13 versus 10 months (P = 0.0233).  Conclusion:   This study highlights key differences in patient characteristics encountered by community practitioners. In this population, which presented with clinically advanced disease, there was an improved survival benefit for those treated earlier in their disease. Radium-223 was well tolerated and concurrent treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide did not add additional toxicity.

There are, however, several technological differences between PET/CT and PET/MR systems which affect the PET image quality. The objective of this study was to assess the reproducibility of PET/CT and PET/MR SUV's in recurrent prostate cancer patients. We randomized the patients regarding the order of the PET/CT and PET/MR scans to reduce the influence of tracer uptake as a function of time.  Methods:   Thirty patients, all with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, underwent whole-body PET/CT and PET/MR scans after intravenous injection of a single dose of 68Ga-PSMA-11. Fifteen patients underwent PET/CT first and 15 patients underwent PET/MR first. Volumes of interest on tumor lesions were outlined and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) corrected for lean body mass was calculated. Correlation and agreement between scans were assessed by generalized linear mixed-effects models and Bland-Altman analysis. The association between SUV, patient characteristics and imaging parameters was assessed.  Results:   Eighteen of the 30 evaluated patients had at least one positive lesion, giving an overall detection rate of 60%. In total, there were 34 visible lesions: 5 local recurrences, 22 lymph node metastases and 7 bone metastases. One group acquired PET/CT and PET/MR at median time points of 63.0 and 159.0 min, while the other group acquired PET/MR and PET/CT at median time points of 92.0 and 149.0 min. SUVmax between scans was linearly correlated, described by the equation Y(PET/CT SUVmax) = 0.75 + 1.00 × (PET/MR SUVmax), on average 20% higher on PET/CT than on PET/MR.

Moreover, effectiveness of postoperative radiation therapy (PRT) after radical prostatectomy (RP) was also assessed in patients aged < 50 years.  Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End results database (2004-2014), non-metastatic cT3-4 LAPC patients treated with LT (RP, RT or RP+RT) were identified. After propensity score matching (PSM), cancer-specific mortality (CSM), overall survival (OS), and other-cause mortality (OCM) rates were assessed. Multivariable competing risk regression (MVA CRR) model was also used in our analysis.  Results:   1507 younger (< 50 years) and 34833 older (≥ 50 years) LAPC patients treated with LT were identified. Younger patients with LAPC had overall more aggressive disease features than their older counterparts. After PSM, younger patients yielded higher cumulative CSM rates than the older patients (P = 0.046). However, OS and cumulative OCM rates were significantly higher (P = 0.038 and P < 0.0001, respectively) in the older cohort. In the MVA CRR model, younger patients yielded higher CSM (P = 0.02). Specifically, younger patients resulted in higher CSM in Gleason score 8-10, cT3b/4 stage, cN1 stage, and patients treated with RP. No statistically significant differences were found in patients treated with RP versus RP+PRT in all parameters.  Conclusions:   LAPC patients aged < 50 years yielded higher CSM after LT, specifically after RP, compared with the older counterparts (≥ 50 years).

Healing Choices for Men with Prostate Cancer is a multimedia educational and decision aid program. This nation-wide randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of Healing Choices on reducing decisional conflict and distress. Eligible prostate cancer patients who called the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS) were invited to participate. After a baseline interview, participants were randomized to usual personalized consultation with a CIS specialist (comparison condition) or CIS personalized consultation plus the Healing Choices program (intervention condition). The Decision Conflict Scale and Impact of Event Scale assessed decisional conflict about prostate cancer treatment and cancer-related distress, respectively. Analyses evaluated group differences at 2 months postenrollment. Hypothesized moderation of intervention effects by demographic and clinical characteristics were evaluated. The final sample consisted of N = 349 participants (intervention: n = 181; comparison n = 168). Men were on average 64 years old, primarily White, and well educated. The difference in total decisional conflict was not significant (DCS total score; F[1,311] = .99, p = .32). The difference in cancer-related distress at 2 months between the intervention and the comparison groups was not significant (F[1,337] = .01, p = .93).

The association between sepsis and subsequent risk of cancer is poorly understood.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database, we conducted a case-control study in US adults. We included 1801156 cases with a first cancer diagnosis in SEER during 1992-2013 (ages 66-115 years) and 200000 cancer-free controls from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. Sepsis was identified using inpatient Medicare claims. Associations with sepsis were estimated using logistic regression.  Results:   After correction for multiple comparisons, sepsis was significantly associated with increased risk for cancers of the colon (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.12), rectum (1.13), liver (1.47), lung (1.17), and cervix (1.52), as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML, 1.19), chronic myeloid leukemia (1.54), and myelodysplastic syndrome (1.30). Inverse associations were observed for cancers of the breast (aOR = 0.86), prostate (0.75), kidney (0.90), and thyroid (0.68) and for melanoma (0.83), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (0.89), and follicular lymphoma (0.65). Sepsis was significantly associated with the following 9 types of cancer in the period >5 years following sepsis diagnosis: thyroid, prostate, colon, rectum, lung, and liver and follicular lymphoma, melanoma, and AML.  Conclusions:   Sepsis is associated with increased or decreased risks for a small group of cancers. Factors that may explain these associations include etiologic effects.

Population controls (n = 512) were sampled from electoral lists. SEP was measured at three different periods of life based on respondent's report: during childhood, young adulthood and mid-life. We used a structured modeling approach using a series of unconditional logistic regressions to test which models best fit the data. Life course SEP increased the risk of all cancers. SEP in childhood was identified as a critical period for prostate and all gastrointestinal tract cancers except for esophagus cancer. In addition, the accumulation model best explained the data for melanoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma.

Methods:   Responses from persons aged 25 and older to the 1991 Long Form Census were linked to national mortality and cancer databases. First Nations- and non-Aboriginal-specific incidence rates were age-standardized to the world standard population. The sex- and site-specific relative risks (RR) of cancer in First Nations compared to those in non-Aboriginal adults were estimated with Poisson regression. Results were stratified by residence on-reserve (all cancers combined) and region of Canada (four most common cancer sites).  Results:   Compared to non-Aboriginal adults, First Nations had higher incidence of colon and rectum, kidney, cervix, and liver cancers and lower incidence of prostate, breast, bladder, uterus, ovary, and brain cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and melanoma. First Nations women additionally had higher incidence of stomach, gallbladder, and laryngeal cancers and lower incidence of thyroid cancers compared to non-Aboriginal women. The higher relative incidence of stomach and gallbladder cancers was observed only among First Nations adults who reported living on-reserve. Incidence of lung cancer was similar for First Nations and non-Aboriginal adults nationally, though variation by region of Canada was observed.  Conclusion:   First Nations people in Canada have disproportionately high rates of certain cancers, providing evidence to support public health policy and programming.

Methods:   A total of 177 patients who presented in an academic institution with a tPSA between 2 and 10 ng/ml and underwent prostate biopsies within the 3 months were enrolled. With phi and tPSA thresholds of 43 and 4 ng/ml, respectively, probability for each branch of a decision tree model for PCa diagnosis and corresponding mean cost were estimated with ""Monte Carlo"" simulations. A sensitivity analysis was performed.  Results:   With a similar sensitivity, phi strategy increased positive predictive value by 13.9 points and negative predictive value by 31.6 points in comparison to tPSA strategy. Mean costs per patient with tPSA and phi strategies were €514 and €528, respectively, for a phi test price at 50€. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that phi strategy was less expensive (508€/patient) than tPSA strategy with a phi test price below 30€. In multi-criteria sensitivity analysis, PPV and the rates of positive phi and tPSA were the parameters with the largest impact on the final cost as opposed to the cost of the biopsy or imaging which have less influence.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) can significantly increase PSMA expression on PC cells. Additionally, retrospective clinical data in large patient cohorts suggest a positive association between ongoing ADT and a pathological PSMA PET/CT scan. The present evaluation was conducted to further analyse the influence of long-term ADT on PSMA PET/CT findings.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed of all 1,704 patients who underwent a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan at our institution from 2011 to 2017 to detect PC. Of 306 patients scanned at least twice, 10 had started and continued ADT with a continuous clinical response between the two PSMA PET/CT scans. These ten patients were included in the current analysis which compared the tracer uptake intensity and volume of PC lesions on PSMA PET/CT before and during ongoing ADT.  Results:   Overall, 31 PC lesions were visible in all ten patients before initiation of ADT. However, during ongoing ADT (duration 42-369 days, median 230 days), only 14 lesions were visible in eight of the ten patients. The average tracer uptake values decreased in 71% and increased in 12.9% of the PC lesions. Of all lesions, 33.3% were still visible in six patients with a complete PSA response (≤0.1 ng/ml).  Conclusion:   Continuous long-term ADT significantly reduces the visibility of castration-sensitive PC on PSMA PET/CT. If the objective is visualization of the maximum possible extent of disease, we recommend referring patients for PSMA PET/CT before starting ADT.""","""['Ali Afshar-Oromieh', 'Nils Debus', 'Monika Uhrig', 'Thomas A Hope', 'Michael J Evans', 'Tim Holland-Letz', 'Frederik L Giesel', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Clemens Kratochwil', 'Uwe Haberkorn']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on 68Ga-PSMA tracer uptake in non-metastatic prostate cancer patients.', 'Prospective study on the effect of short-term androgen deprivation therapy on PSMA uptake evaluated with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI in men with treatment-naïve prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA-11 (HBED-CC) PET/CT in patients with recurrent prostate cancer: evaluation in 1007 patients.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'The significance of metabolic response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy detected with 68GaGa-PSMA-11-PET/CT in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy.', 'Quantitative assessment of PSMA PET response to therapy in castration-sensitive prostate cancer using an automated imaging platform for disease identification and measurement.', 'A Review of Modern Imaging Landscape for Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Clinical Guide.', 'Necessity of Pelvic Lymph Node Irradiation in Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy in the PSMA PET/CT Era: A Narrative Review.', 'PSMA Receptor-Based PET-CT: The Basics and Current Status in Clinical and Research Applications.']"""

The GABAergic system is enriched in NE-like cells, and contributes to PCa progression. Additionally, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) stimulates the secretion of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) in peripheral organs. For the first time, in this study we show the role of GABA and GABAB receptor 1 (GABBR1) expression in GRP secretion in NE-like prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated an increase in GRP levels in NE-like cell medium treated with GABAB receptor agonist. Moreover, the blocking of this receptor inhibited GABA-induced GRP secretion. The invasive potential of PC3 cells was enhanced by either GRP or conditioned medium of NE-like cells treated with GABA. Additionally, we confirmed a positive correlation between GABA and GRP levels in the serum of PCa patients with NE markers. Finally, using public available data sets, we found a negative correlation between GABBR1 and androgen receptor (AR) expression, as well as a strong positive correlation between GABBR1 and enolase 2.

We examined occupational exposure to benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX) and styrene and PCa risk in a population-based case-control study in Montreal, Canada.  Methods:   Cases aged ≤75 years diagnosed with PCa in 2005-2009 (n=1920) and population controls frequency-matched on age (n=1989) provided detailed work histories. Experts evaluated the certainty, frequency and concentration of exposure to monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in each job lasting ≥2 years. Logistic regression estimated OR and 95% CIs for PCa risk, adjusting for potential confounders.  Results:   Exposures to BTX were highly intercorrelated, except for durations of exposure at substantial levels. Ever exposure to any BTX was associated with overall PCa (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.53), while the OR for styrene was 1.19. However, increases in risk were largely confined to low-grade tumours, with ORs of 1.33 (95%CI 1.08 to 1.64) and 1.41 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.31) for ever exposure to any BTX and styrene, respectively, and a duration response pattern for any BTX. Risks for low-grade tumours were elevated among men exposed ≥25 years at substantial levels of benzene (OR 2.32) and styrene (OR 2.44). Some cumulative exposure categories showed increased risks but without clear trends.  Conclusion:   Exposure to any BTX was associated with higher risks of overall PCa. Prolonged exposures at the substantial level to benzene and styrene increased risks of low-grade tumours.

However, the optimal duration of ADT is not yet defined.  Objective:   The aim of this superiority randomized trial was to compare outcomes of RT combined with either 36 or 18 mo of ADT.  Design, setting and participants:   From October 2000 to January 2008, 630 patients with HRPC were randomized, 310 to pelvic and prostate RT combined with 36 mo (long arm) and 320 to the same RT with 18 mo (short arm) of ADT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QoL) were primary end points. OS rates were compared with Cox Regression model and QoL data were analyzed through mixed linear model.  Results and limitations:   With a median follow-up of 9.4 yr, 290 patients had died (147 long arm vs 143 short arm). The 5-yr OS rates (95% confidence interval) were 91% for long arm (88-95%) and 86% for short arm (83-90%), p=0.07. QoL analysis showed a significant difference (p<0.001) in six scales and 13 items favoring 18 mo ADT with two of them presenting a clinically relevant difference in mean scores of ≥10 points.  Conclusions:   In localized HRPC, our results support that 36 mo is not superior to 18 mo of ADT. ADT combined with RT can potentially be reduced to 18 mo in selected men without compromising survival or QoL. Thus, 18 mo of ADT appears to represent a valid option in HRPC.  Patient summary:   In this study, we report outcomes from high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and either 36 or 18 mo of androgen deprivation therapy.

Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilized to investigate the strength of the association.  Results:   For miR-499 polymorphism, a significant association was observed between the rs3746444 A>G polymorphism and PCa risk in heterozygote comparison and dominant genetic model, in particular in Asian population subgroup. For miR-146a polymorphism, the rs2910164 CC genotype was associated with decreased PCa risk in Asian population in homozygote comparison.

In this paper, we propose an automated planning methodology that aims to combine both explorative and prescriptive approaches for improving the efficiency and the quality of the treatment planning process. Given a treatment plan, our explorative approach explores trade-offs between different objectives and finds an acceptable region for objective function weights via inverse optimization. Intuitively, the shape and size of these regions describe how 'sensitive' a patient is to perturbations in objective function weights. We then develop an integer programming-based prescriptive approach that exploits the information encoded by these regions to find a set of five representative objective function weight vectors such that for each patient there exists at least one representative weight vector that can produce a high quality treatment plan. Using 315 patients from Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, we show that the produced treatment plans are comparable and, for [Formula: see text] of cases, improve upon the inversely optimized plans that are generated from the historical clinical treatment plans.""","""['Ali Goli', 'Justin J Boutilier', 'Tim Craig', 'Michael B Sharpe', 'Timothy C Y Chan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['First fully automated planning solution for robotic radiosurgery - comparison with automatically planned volumetric arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Multicriteria plan optimization in the hands of physicians: a pilot study in prostate cancer and brain tumors.', 'Inverse optimization of objective function weights for treatment planning using clinical dose-volume histograms.', 'Automatically configuring the reference point method for automated multi-objective treatment planning.', ""Clinician's guide to prostate IMRT plan assessment and optimisation.""]"""

Methods:   A total of 57 patients eligible to receive 223Ra-dichloride over a 2-year period (March 2014 to March 2016) were retrospectively assessed and prospectively followed (median follow up 298 days). 223Ra-Dichloride was administered at 4-week intervals for a maximum of six injections. The numbers of patients in years 1 and 2 referred in relation to extent of bone disease (EOBD) category and overall survival (OS) were determined. The prognostic factors EOBD category, baseline tALP (tALPBL), tALP response, greatest percentage reduction in tALP from baseline in any treatment cycle (ALPmax; among patients with elevated ALPBL), and the presence of lymphadenopathy were assessed as predictors of OS.  Results:   The proportion of patients with EOBD1 was higher in year 2 than in year 1 (29% and 4%, respectively), and in year 2 there was a lower rate of symptomatic skeleton-related events, a higher proportion of patients completing six cycles, and longer (albeit nonsignificant) OS (p = 0.55). There were significant differences in OS between EOBD4 patients and those in all other groups and between EOBD1 and EOBD3 patients (p < 0.05). OS was longer in patients with normal tALPBL than in those with elevated tALPBL (p = 0.01), in ALP responders than in nonresponders (p < 0.05), and in patients without lymphadenopathy than in those with lymphadenopathy (p = 0.29). OS was correlated with ALPmax (r2 = 0.24).  Conclusion:   A collaborative multidisciplinary referrals pathway, together with increased experience with 223Ra-dichloride, led to improved outcomes. In patients with elevated tALPBL, tALP dynamics may be useful for monitoring response and predicting OS. Imaging and prognostic markers may therefore be of value for individualizing 223Ra-dichloride treatment and planning retreatment; however, further studies are required.""","""['Sabina Dizdarevic', 'Maryam Jessop', 'Patrick Begley', 'Sean Main', 'Angus Robinson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Baseline quality of life predicts overall survival in patients with mCRPC treated with 223Ra-dichloride.', 'Prostate-specific antigen flare induced by 223RaCl2 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A 3-variable prognostic score (3-PS) for overall survival prediction in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with 223Radium-dichloride.', 'Radium-223 dichloride in patients with castration-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Radium-223 dichloride: a novel treatment option for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'Genomic and Phenotypic Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Guidance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Factors Influencing Outcome Post-Radium-223 Dichloride in Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Review of Some Real-World Challenges.', 'Outcomes and Factors Associated with Completion of Radium-223 Therapy.', 'Radium-223 dichloride treatment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in Finland: A real-world evidence multicenter study.', 'Biomarkers for Treatment Response in Advanced Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Human PCa cell lines (LNCaP and C4-2) were co-cultured with human mast cell line (HMC-1) in Transwell chambers. Androgen receptor (AR) was silenced in C4-2 cells using sh-AR lentivirus, and p21 was knocked down and overexpressed by transfecting C4-2 cells with pLKO.1-sh-p21 and pCMV-p21, respectively. The morphological changes of LNCaP and C4-2 cells were observed. MTT assay and colony formation assay were used to assess the proliferation of LNCaP and C4-2 cells.

Methods:   A total of 25 fixed 13-field clinical prostate cancer intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)/stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) plans were collected with a prescribed dose of 50 Gy. With the distance from each voxel to the planned target volume (PTV) boundary, the distance from each voxel to each organ-at-risk (OAR), and the volume of PTV as the geometric anatomical characteristics of the patients, the voxel deposition dose was used as the plan dosimetric feature. A neural network was used to construct the correlation model between the selected input features and output dose distribution, and the model was trained with 20 randomly selected cases and verified in 5 cases.  Results:   The constructed model showed a small model training error, small dose differences among the verification samples, and produced accurate prediction results. In the model training, the point-to-point mean dose difference (hereinafter dose difference) of the 3D dose distribution was no greater than 0.0919∓3.6726 Gy, and the average of the relative volume values corresponding to the fixed dose sequence in the DVH (hereinafter DVH difference) did not exceed 1.7%. The dose differences among the 5 samples for validation was 0.1634∓10.5246 Gy with percent dose differences within 2.5% and DVH differences within 3%. The 3D dose distribution showed that the dose difference was small with reasonable predicted dose distribution. This model showed better performances for dose distribution prediction for bladder and rectum than for the femoral heads.

SPOP (Speckle-type POZ Protein) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in primary prostate cancer, suggesting that SPOP may be a potential driver of prostate cancer. The aim of this work was to investigate how SPOP mutations contribute to prostate cancer development and progression.  Methods:   To identify molecular mediators of the tumor suppressive function of SPOP, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen in a HeLa cDNA library using the full-length SPOP as bait. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting were used to analyze the interaction between SPOP and ATF2. Cell migration and invasion were determined by Transwell assays. Immunohistochemistry were used to analyze protein levels in patients' tumor samples.  Results:   Here we identified ATF2 as a bona fide substrate of the SPOP-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. SPOP recognizes multiple Ser/Thr (S/T)-rich degrons in ATF2 and triggers ATF2 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Strikingly, prostate cancer-associated mutants of SPOP are defective in promoting ATF2 degradation in prostate cancer cells and contribute to facilitating prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

Aim of this study is to present the results of some evidence-based quality indicators (QI) for prostate cancer (PC) at the population-based level and to compare the outcomes with data available in the literature.  Methods:   The study included all PC diagnosed on a three years period analysis (01.01.2011-31.12.2013) in the population of Canton Ticino (Southern Switzerland) extracted from the Ticino Cancer Registry database. 13 QI, approved through the validated Delphi methodology, were calculated using the ""available case"" approach: 2 for diagnosis, 4 for pathology, 6 for treatment and 1 for outcome. The selection of the computed QI was based on the availability of medical documentation. QI are presented as proportion (%) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.  Results:   700 PC were detected during the three-year period 2011-2013: 78.3% of them were diagnosed through a prostatic biopsy and for 72.5% 8 or more biopsy cores were taken. 46.5% of the low risk PC patients underwent active surveillance, while 69.2% of high risk PC underwent a radical treatment (radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy or brachytherapy) and 73.5% of patients with metastatic PC were treated with hormonal therapy. The overall 30-day postoperative mortality was 0.5%.  Conclusions:   Results emerging from this study on the QoCC for PC in Canton Ticino are encouraging: the choice of treatment modalities seems to respect the international guidelines and our results are comparable to the scarce number of available international studies.

Here, we report a previously unexplored connection between autophagy and DDR, via a deubiquitnase (DUB), USP14. Loss of autophagy in prostate cancer cells led to unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as indicated by persistent ionizing radiation (IR)-induced foci (IRIF) formation for γH2AFX, and decreased protein levels and IRIF formation for RNF168, an E3-ubiquitin ligase essential for chromatin Ubn and recruitment of critical DDR effector proteins in response to DSBs, including TP53BP1. Consistently, RNF168-associated Ubn signaling and TP53BP1 IRIF formation were reduced in autophagy-deficient cells. An activity assay identified several DUBs, including USP14, which showed higher activity in autophagy-deficient cells. Importantly, inhibiting USP14 could overcome DDR defects in autophagy-deficient cells. USP14 IRIF formation and protein stability were increased in autophagy-deficient cells. Co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization of USP14 with MAP1LC3B and the UBA-domain of SQSTM1 identified USP14 as a substrate of autophagy and SQSTM1. Additionally, USP14 directly interacted with RNF168, which depended on the MIU1 domain of RNF168. These findings identify USP14 as a novel substrate of autophagy and regulation of RNF168-dependent Ubn and TP53BP1 recruitment by USP14 as a critical link between DDR and autophagy. Given the role of Ubn signaling in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), the major pathway for repair of IR-induced DNA damage, these findings provide unique insights into the link between autophagy, DDR-associated Ubn signaling and NHEJ DNA repair.

Signal changes were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively and were then correlated with the results of subsequent biopsy performed at 3 and 12 months after ablation.  Results:   MRI performed immediately after ablation revealed a hypovascular defect in the ablation zone, with patchy or bandlike decreased T2 signal most commonly noted at 3 months (in 66.7% of ablated lesions) and T2 scarring observed in most lesions (66.7%) at 12 months. Patchy or bandlike decreased apparent diffusion coefficient signal and scarlike changes were most prevalent at 3 months after ablation (50.0% of lesions), and these features remained the most commonly observed findings at 12 months after ablation (27.8% of lesions). At 12 months after ablation, 10 patients were found to have recurrent tumor, with three patients found to have persistent cancer when biopsy was performed at the ablation site. All postablation biopsy cases with positive results showed suspicious T2 and apparent diffusion coefficient characteristics, which were considered to be a well-defined nodular intermediate signal on both of these sequences. Two of the patients for whom positive biopsy findings were noted had focal enhancement of the ablation zone.

Results:   Tumors were downgraded to intermediate risk (GS 4 + 3 [n = 7] and GS 3 + 4 [n = 2]) PCa in 30.0% (9/30) of men after RP. There were no statistically significant differences between groups with respect to age (p = 0.028), prostate-specific antigen level (p = 0.018), or clinical stage (p = 0.021). PI-RADS version 2 scores did not differ between groups (p = 0.035, p = 0.091) with moderate agreement (κ = 0.48). There were no differences in mean or centile ADC (p = 0.269-0.634) between the two groups. ADC entropy was significantly lower in downgraded tumors (5.542 ± 0.721 [SD] vs 8.089 ± 1.237, p < 0.001) with no difference in kurtosis or skewness (p = 0.133, p = 0.296). The ROC AUC for the diagnosis of downgrading was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.84-1.00) with sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 88.9% when entropy was less than 6.31.  Conclusion:   ADC entropy was significantly lower in GS 9 and 10 tumors diagnosed by means of nontargeted transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy that were eventually downgraded to intermediate risk (GS 7) after RP.

We apply nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to select the maximally uncorrelated differentially expressed genes in the cancer class with minimum confusion_factor.

Many traditional clustering methods such as NMF-based models, have been widely used to identify tumors. However, they cannot achieve satisfactory results. Recently, subspace clustering approaches have been proposed to improve the performance by dividing the original space into multiple low-dimensional subspaces. Among them, low rank representation is becoming a popular approach to attain subspace clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel Low Rank Subspace Clustering model via Discrete Constraint and Hypergraph Regularization (DHLRS). The proposed method learns the cluster indicators directly by using discrete constraint, which makes the clustering task simple. For each subspace, we adopt Schatten -norm to better approximate the low rank constraint. Moreover, Hypergraph Regularization is adopted to infer the complex relationship between genes and intrinsic geometrical structure of gene expression data in each subspace. Finally, the molecular pattern of tumor gene expression data sets is discovered according to the optimized cluster indicators.

Methods:   Tissue-mimicking prostate phantoms were manufactured with embedded fiducials. The fiducials were used to measure and compare target registration error (TRE) between phantoms that were sliced by hand versus phantoms that were sliced within 3-D-printed molds. Subsequently, ten radical prostatectomy specimens were placed inside molds, scanned with MRI, and then sliced. The ex vivo scan was used to assess the true location of whole mount (WM) slides relative to in vivo MRI. The TRE between WM and in vivo MRI was measured using anatomic landmarks.  Results:   Manually sliced phantoms had a 4.1-mm mean TRE, whereas mold-sliced phantoms had a 1.9-mm mean TRE. Similarly, mold-assisted slicing reduced mean angular misalignment around the left-right (LR) anatomic axis from 10.7° to 4.5°. However, ex vivo MRI revealed that excised prostates were misaligned within molds, including a mean 14° rotation about the LR axis. The mean in-plane TRE was 3.3 mm using molds alone and 2.2 mm after registration was corrected with ex vivo MRI.  Conclusion:   Patient-specific molds improved accuracy relative to manual slicing techniques in a phantom model. However, the registration accuracy of surgically resected specimens was limited by their imperfect fit within molds. This limitation can be overcome with the addition of ex vivo imaging.

The communications between the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) and its coactivator are critical to the activation of AR. It is still unclear how the ligand binding would affect the AR-coactivator interactions. In this work, the effects of the ligand binding on the AR-coactivator communications were explored by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results showed that the ligand binding regulates the residue interactions in the function site AF-2. The ligand-to-coactivator allosteric pathway, which involves the coactivator, helix 3 (H3), helix 4 (H4), the loop between H3 and H4 (L3), and helix 12 (H12), and ligands, was characterized. In addition, the interactions of residues on the function site BF-3, especially on the boundary of AF-2 and BF-3, are also affected by the ligands. The MM/GBSA free energy calculations demonstrated that the binding affinity between the coactivator and apo-AR is roughly weaker than those between the coactivator and antagonistic ARs but stronger than those between the coactivator and agonistic ARs. The results indicated that the long-range electrostatic interactions and the conformational entropies are the main factors affecting the binding free energies. In addition, the F876L mutation on AR-LBD affects the ligand-to-coactivator allosteric pathway, which could be the reason for point mutation induced tolerance for the antagonistic drugs such as enzalutamide.

Methods:   We analyzed 793 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and 272 men with negative prostate biopsy. Serum levels of IGF-1 and testosterone were measured before surgery or biopsy.  Results:   The mean IGF-1 levels of prostate cancer patients and men with a negative biopsy were 143.8 and 118.9 ng/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). Men with high serum IGF-1 were more likely to have prostate cancer (highest vs lowest quartile, odds ratio [OR] = 3.35; Ptrend < 0.001). However, among men with prostate cancer, the mean IGF-1 levels of those with low (GS ≤ 6), intermediate (GS = 7), and high surgical GS (GS ≥8) were 151.7, 144.1, and 132.9 ng/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). Using quartile analysis, high serum IGF-1 levels were shown to be associated with a low risk of high surgical GS (OR = 0.464; Ptrend = 0.006). Serum bioavailable testosterone concentration was positively correlated with serum IGF-1 level (r = 0.157, P < 0.001). High bioavailable testosterone level was also associated with a low risk of high surgical GS in patients without diabetes mellitus (OR = 0.569; Ptrend = 0.040). Among men with biopsy GS ≤ 3 + 4 (n = 460), upgrading to high surgical GS was more frequent in patients with low IGF-1 level (≤116.0 ng/mL; 9.9%) or low bioavailable testosterone level (≤0.85 ng/mL; 9.3%) than in patients with normal IGF-1 and bioavailable testosterone levels (2.6%; P = 0.004).  Conclusions:   Serum levels of IGF-1 and bioavailable testosterone show inverse associations with high surgical GS.

We previously transfected (human Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor, huGRPr) into Ace-1 cells and demonstrated receptor-targeted NIRF imaging with IR800-G-Abz4-t-BBN, an agonist to huGRPr. Herein, we used the new cell line to develop the first canine prostate cancer model expressing a human growth factor receptor.  Methods:   Dogs were immunosuppressed with cyclosporine, azathioprine, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. Their prostate glands were implanted with Ace-1huGRPr cells. The implantation wounds were sealed with a cyanoacrylic adhesive to prevent extraprostatic tumor growth. Intraprostatic tumors grew in 4-5 week. A lobar prostatic artery was then catheterized via the carotid artery and 25-100 nmol IR800-Abz4-t-BBN was infused in 2 mL followed by euthanasia in dogs 1-2, and recovery for 24 h before euthanasia in dogs 3-6. Excised tissues were imaged optically imaged, and histopathology performed.  Results:   Dog1 grew no tumors with cyclosporine alone. Using the four drug protocol, Dogs 2-6 grew abundant 1-2 mm intracapsular and 1-2 cm intraglandular tumors. Tumors grew >5 cm when the prostate cancer cells became extracapsular. Dogs 4-6 with sealed prostatic capsule implantation sites had growth of intracapsular and intraglandular tumors and LN metastases at 5 weeks. High tumor to background BPH signal in the NIRF images of sectioned prostate glands resulted from the 100 nmol dose (∼8 nmol/kg) in dogs 2-4 and 50 nmol dose in dog 5, but not from the 25 nmol dose in Dog 6. Imaging of mouse Ace-1huGRPr tumors required an intravenous dose of 500 nmol/kg body wt. A lymph node that drained the prostate gland was detectable in Dog 4. Histologic findings confirmed the imaging data.  Conclusion:   Ace-1huGRPr cells created viable, huGRPr-expressing tumors when implanted orthotopically into immune-suppressed dogs. Local delivery of an imaging agent through the prostatic artery allowed a very low imaging dose, suggesting that therapeutic agents could be used safely for treatment of early localized intraglandular prostate cancer as adjuvant therapy for active surveillance or focal ablation therapies, or for treating multifocal intraglandular disease where focal ablation therapies are not indicated or ineffective.""","""['Michael F Tweedle', 'Haiming Ding', 'William T Drost', 'Joshua Dowell', 'James Spain', 'Mathew Joseph', 'Said M Elshafae', 'Maria-Isabela Menendez', 'Li Gong', 'Shankaran Kothandaraman', 'Wessel P Dirksen', 'Chadwick L Wright', 'Robert Bahnson', 'Michael V Knopp', 'Thomas J Rosol']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A human GRPr-transfected Ace-1 canine prostate cancer model in mice.', 'Near-infrared fluorescence imaging of gastrin releasing peptide receptor targeting in prostate cancer lymph node metastases.', 'Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) promotes EMT, growth, and invasion in canine prostate cancer.', 'Animal models of bone metastasis.', 'Canine prostate models in preclinical studies of minimally invasive interventions: part I, canine prostate anatomy and prostate cancer models.', 'Extracellular ATP and Macropinocytosis: Their Interactive and Mutually Supportive Roles in Cell Growth, Drug Resistance, and EMT in Cancer.', 'Effect of Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) and SP600125, a JNK Inhibitor, on Wnt Signaling in Canine Prostate Cancer Growth and Bone Metastases.', 'Novel Peptide NIRF Optical Surgical Navigation Agents for HNSCC.', 'Stability Evaluation and Stabilization of a Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRPR) Targeting Imaging Pharmaceutical.']"""

Methods and results:   Cases were divided into 3 groups-Group 1 (n = 80): <3 mm in end-to-end tumor measurement (continuous/discontinuous); Group 2 (n = 22): ≥3 mm in tumor length (continuous); and Group 3 (n = 15): ≥3 mm in end-to-end tumor measurement (discontinuous). The rate of Gleason score ≥7 was considerably lower in Group 1 (9%/30% on PBx/RP) than in Group 2 (50% [P < 0.001]/59% [P = 0.015] on PBx/RP) or Group 3 (40% [P = 0.005]/46% [P = 0.237] on PBx/RP). pT2 disease was significantly more often found in Group 1 (88%) than in Group 2 (68%, P = 0.049) or Group 3 (60%, P = 0.018).

Methods:   Cross-sectional survey of 118 radiation oncologists at 75 Radiation Oncology (RO) departments in Spain.  Results:   A total of 55 radiation oncologists from 52 RO departments (52/75; 69%) completed the survey. Prostate mpMRI is performed at 94.5% of the centres that provided data. The most common indications for mpMRI in routine clinical practice were: (1) detection/localization of the tumour prior to second biopsy (82.7%), (2) cancer staging (80.8%), and (3) detection of recurrence after definitive treatment (80.8%). Most respondents (72.7%) reported modifying the primary radiotherapy treatment when mpMRI findings indicate a more advanced T stage with a resultant change in the risk group. Most respondents (90.5%) treat macroscopic local recurrence after prostatectomy with high doses, ranging from 71 to 83 Gy; in 37.7% of cases, the full dose is delivered to the entire prostate bed. In pelvic nodal recurrence, more than half (59.3%) of the respondents reported performing elective pelvic radiotherapy, including the prostate bed, with a boost to the involved nodes.

The USPSTF grade D recommendation may impact this trend in North American patients. We assessed contemporary stage migration and treatment trends in a large North American cohort diagnosed with PCa 2009-2014.  Methods:   Time-trend analyses were performed in patients within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, with complete data of clinical tumor stage, biopsy Gleason score, and validated PSA values, resulting in 211,645 assessable patients. Patients were stratified according to their different treatment methods [radical prostatectomy (RP), radiotherapy (RT), and no local treatment (NLT)] and according to clinical and pathological risk stratification (D'Amico and CAPRA-S score).  Results:   Over time, proportions of D'Amico low-risk (LR) decreased, with an increase in intermediate-to-high-risk (IR/HR) patients. These trends were more distinct in men ≥ 70 years. NLT proportions increased, most notably in D'Amico LR and/or older patients. Conversely, RP proportions remained stable in younger HR and increased in older HR patients. Similar patterns were demonstrated in the RP-treated subgroup: D'Amico HR, pT3, and/or lymph-node invasion or CAPRA-S HR proportions increased from 23.5 to 30.8, 24.3 to 32.9, and 10.7 to 16.3% (each p ≤ 0.015).  Conclusions:   Inverse stage migration with increase of unfavorable PCa continues in most contemporary North American patients. However, a paradigm shift to treat LR patients with less invasive methods (NLT) was demonstrated. Contrary, HR patients increasingly undergo LT. Future studies with long-term follow-up might answer if inverse stage migration vs. treatment trends translate into different PCa metastases/mortality rates vs. proposed NLT benefits, particularly related to USPSTF-recommended reduced PSA screening.""","""['Sami-Ramzi Leyh-Bannurah', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Raisa S Pompe', 'Felix Preisser', 'Emanuele Zaffuto', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Alberto Briganti', 'Omar Nafez', 'Margit Fisch', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Markus Graefen', 'Lars Budäus']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Contemporary Management of Prostate Cancer Patients Suitable for Active Surveillance: A North American Population-based Study.', 'External validation of the UCSF-CAPRA (University of California, San Francisco, Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment) in Japanese patients receiving radical prostatectomy.', 'Trend of Adverse Stage Migration in Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', ""The association of the type and number of D'Amico high-risk criteria with rates of pathologically non-organ-confined prostate cancer."", 'Changing nationwide trends away from overtreatment among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy over the past 25\xa0years.', 'Biomarkers of Aggressive Prostate Cancer at Diagnosis.', 'The Dilemma of Misclassification Rates in Senior Patients With Prostate Cancer, Who Were Treated With Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Implications for Patient Counseling and Diagnostics.', 'Improvement of quality of life and symptom burden after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in patients with moderate to severe LUTS.']"""

KM-Express also contains The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets for 30 other cancer types with matching cell line expression data for 23 of them. We present KM-Express as a hypothesis generation tool for researchers to identify potential new prognostic RNA biomarkers as well as targets for further downstream functional cell-based studies. Specifically, KM-Express allows users to compare the expression level of genes in different groups of patients based on molecular, genetic, clinical and pathological status. Moreover, KM-Express aids the design of biological experiments based on the expression profile of the genes in different cell lines. Thus, KM-Express provides a one-stop analysis from bench work to clinical prospects. We have used this tool to successfully evaluate the prognostic potential of previously published biomarkers for prostate cancer and breast cancer.

The main source of arsenical exposure is drinking water. Nowadays, it is well known that the chronic exposure to arsenicals leads to a series of epigenetic alterations that have a role in arsenic-induced effects on human health including cancer. Based on these observations, the aim of our study was to select by network analysis the genes/proteins/miRNAs implicated in kidney, bladder and prostate cancer development upon arsenical exposure. From this analysis we identified: (i) the nodes linking the three molecular networks specific for kidney, bladder and prostate cancer; (ii) the relative HUB nodes (RXRA, MAP3K7, NR3C1, PABPC1, NDRG1, RELA and CTNNB1) that link the three cancer networks; (iii) the miRNAs able to target these HUB nodes. In conclusion, we highlighted a panel of potential molecules related to the molecular mechanisms of arsenical-induced cancerogenesis and suggest their utility as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.""","""['Andrea Polo', 'Silvia Marchese', 'Giuseppina De Petro', 'Maurizio Montella', 'Gennaro Ciliberto', 'Alfredo Budillon', 'Susan Costantini']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Long noncoding RNA in prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer.', 'MicroRNA in prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer: a systematic review.', 'MicroRNAs as regulators of signal transduction in urological tumors.', 'Prognostic and predictive miRNA biomarkers in bladder, kidney and prostate cancer: Where do we stand in biomarker development?', 'Construction and analysis of mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and TF regulatory networks reveal the key genes associated with prostate cancer.', 'miRNAs and arsenic-induced carcinogenesis.', 'Dysregulation of lipid metabolism and pathological inflammation in patients with COVID-19.', 'Suppressive effect of platycodin D on bladder cancer through microRNA-129-5p-mediated PABPC1/PI3K/AKT axis inactivation.', 'Apolipoprotein E genotype and the association between C-reactive protein and postoperative delirium: Importance of gene-protein interactions.', 'Differential tissue expression of extracellular vesicle-derived proteins in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   An analytical observational study with retrospective data collection was conducted. We reviewed the medical records of all the patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between the years 2012-2014. The analysis of the data included a bivariate model to study the associations between BMI and the surgical procedure, its complications, oncologic outcomes and cancer follow-up. Then, we used multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine if there was an independent association between oncologic outcomes and BMI; the model was adjusted by age, hypertension and diabetes mellitus.  Results:   272 patients underwent radical prostatectomy: 98 (36.0%) had normal BMI, 142 (52.2%) were overweight and 32 (11.8%) were obese. The median age was 61 interquartile range (IQR=56-66) years old. There were no statistically significant differences in the preoperative and postoperative outcomes according to BMI. The obese patients had longer operative time (176 minutes, IQR=165.0-195.5) nonetheless, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.18). There were no complications during the procedure (rectal, vascular or obturator nerve injury). The multivariate analysis showed that age, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were not effect modifiers.  Conclusions:   Our study suggests that there are no differences between surgical and postoperative outcomes according to BMI.

The metabolites selected for the study include ten molecules potentially associated with cancer development. Chromatographic separation involved a Phenomenex Synergi Hydro-RP column under gradient conditions. Quantitation of the analytes was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode under negative ionization. Validation parameters were satisfactory and in line with the international guidelines.

The obtained concentrations were normalized with urinary specific gravity (USG) prior to statistical analysis. Five analytes were quantified in all urine samples and we observed the following USG-normalized concentration ranges: citric acid (146.5-6339.8), 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid (22.5-431.7), 2-ketoglutaric acid (4.4-334.4), lactic acid (10.1-786.3), succinic acid (4.1-500.5). 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid significantly decreased between two groups of prostate cancer patients: ≥7 Gleason patients and <7 Gleason patients.

Endpoints included length of surgery, estimated blood loss, visual analogue scale for pain, instrumentation failure, perioperative complications, local control rate, and overall survival.  Results:   All patients underwent TES and circumferential reconstruction of the involved level. Average operative time and estimated blood loss were 282 minutes and 2421 mL, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 41.2 months. We encountered nerve roots stretches in all patients during the surgeries. Three patients experienced acute lower-extremity neurologic dysfunction, but the symptoms were significantly alleviated in 4 weeks postoperatively and fully resolved within 6 months. Five patients showed no evidence of disease at the latest follow-up. Three patients died of metastasis and systemic failure. One patient developed new metastases and was alive with disease.

Prostate cancer specific worry, prostate cancer-related knowledge, health behaviour, and health related quality of life were used as predictors of subsequent participation. Participation to risk-based prostate cancer screening was defined as providing a blood sample for the STHLM3 trial, a study evaluating a risk-based model that predicts the risk for aggressive prostate cancer.  Results:   With a response rate of 20%, 1.347 men (70%) participated in ensuing risk-based prostate cancer screening three months later whereas 568 men (30%) declined participation in the STHLM3-study.

Application of current needle steering techniques are restricted by the limited deflection curvature of needles. Here, a novel steerable needle with improved curvature is developed and used with an online motion planner to steer the needle along curved paths inside tissue. The needle is developed by carving series of small notches on the shaft of a standard needle. The notches decrease the needle flexural stiffness, allowing the needle to follow tightly curved paths with small radius of curvature. In this paper, first, a finite element model of the notched needle deflection in tissue is presented. Next, the model is used to estimate the optimal location for the notches on needle's shaft for achieving a desired curvature. Finally, an ultrasound-guided motion planner for needle steering inside tissue is developed and used to demonstrate the capability of the notched needle in achieving high curvature and maneuvering around obstacles in tissue. We simulated a clinical scenario in brachytherapy, where the target is obstructed by the pubic bone and cannot be reached using regular needles. Experimental results show that the target can be reached using the notched needle with a mean accuracy of 1.2 mm.

Recent studies have shown the potential of TeUS for improving tissue characterization in prostate cancer diagnosis. We study the temporal properties of TeUS-temporal order and length-and present a new framework to assess their impact on tissue information.  Methods:   We utilize a probabilistic modeling approach using hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the temporal signatures of malignant and benign tissues from TeUS signals of nine patients. We model signals of benign and malignant tissues (284 and 286 signals, respectively) in their original temporal order as well as under order permutations. We then compare the resulting models using the Kullback-Liebler divergence and assess their performance differences in characterization. Moreover, we train HMMs using TeUS signals of different durations and compare their model performance when differentiating tissue types.  Results:   Our findings demonstrate that models of order-preserved signals perform statistically significantly better (85% accuracy) in tissue characterization compared to models of order-altered signals (62% accuracy). The performance degrades as more changes in signal order are introduced. Additionally, models trained on shorter sequences perform as accurately as models of longer sequences.  Conclusion:   The work presented here strongly indicates that temporal order has substantial impact on TeUS performance; thus, it plays a significant role in conveying tissue-specific information. Furthermore, shorter TeUS signals can relay sufficient information to accurately distinguish between tissue types.  Significance:   Understanding the impact of TeUS properties facilitates the process of its adopting in diagnostic procedures and provides insights on improving its acquisition.""","""['Layan Nahlawi', 'Caroline Goncalves', 'Farhad Imani', 'Mena Gaed', 'Jose A Gomez', 'Madeleine Moussa', 'Eli Gibson', 'Aaron Fenster', 'Aaron Ward', 'Purang Abolmaesumi', 'Hagit Shatkay', 'Parvin Mousavi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Biomed Eng""","""['Stochastic Sequential Modeling: Toward Improved Prostate Cancer Diagnosis Through Temporal-Ultrasound.', 'Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Prostate Cancer Detection: Analysis of Temporal Enhanced Ultrasound.', 'Investigation of Physical Phenomena Underlying Temporal-Enhanced Ultrasound as a New Diagnostic Imaging Technique: Theory and Simulations.', 'Ultrasound contrast agents and prostate cancer.', 'Imaging in prostate cancer diagnosis: present role and future perspectives.', 'Stochastic Sequential Modeling: Toward Improved Prostate Cancer Diagnosis Through Temporal-Ultrasound.', 'Deep Recurrent Neural Networks for Prostate Cancer Detection: Analysis of Temporal Enhanced Ultrasound.']"""

Methods Patients were randomly assigned to standard four-field radiation therapy (RT) or IMRT radiation treatment. The primary end point was change in patient-reported acute GI toxicity from baseline to the end of RT, measured with the bowel domain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC). Secondary end points included change in patient-reported urinary toxicity, change in GI toxicity measured with the Patient-Reported Outcome Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, and quality of life measured with the Trial Outcome Index. Results From 2012 to 2015, 289 patients were enrolled, of whom 278 were eligible. Between baseline and end of RT, the mean EPIC bowel score declined 23.6 points in the standard RT group and 18.6 points in the IMRT group ( P = .048), the mean EPIC urinary score declined 10.4 points in the standard RT group and 5.6 points in the IMRT group ( P = .03), and the mean Trial Outcome Index score declined 12.8 points in the standard RT group and 8.8 points in the IMRT group ( P = .06). At the end of RT, 51.9% of women who received standard RT and 33.7% who received IMRT reported frequent or almost constant diarrhea ( P = .01), and more patients who received standard RT were taking antidiarrheal medications four or more times daily (20.4% v 7.8%; P = .04).

However, there remains concern for the development of significant toxicities in heavily pretreated patients. In this study, the authors present their local experience, with respect to efficacy and toxicity, of 22 consecutive patients treated with lutetium-177-DOTAGA-(I-y)fk(Sub-KuE) or 177Lu-PSMA I&T radioimmunotherapy for progressive mCRPC, followed up over 1 year.  Materials and methods:   All patients had progressive mCRPC, an European Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) ≤2 with adequate bone marrow and liver function. 177Lu-PSMA I&T therapy was administered at 8-week intervals with a mean prescribed activity of 5.5 GBq (gigabecquerel) per patient.  Results:   Twenty patients had evaluable results, median age of 71 years, and median duration of follow-up of 17 months. Three patients (15%) experienced a G1/2 myelotoxicity and four (20%) G3/4. No incidences of myelodysplasia/acute leukemia have been identified. All toxicities were self-limiting. Baseline cytopenia was predictive of the development of subsequent G3/4 myelotoxicity (p = 0.0035). Eight patients (40%) experienced an objective PSA response, with a median time to response of 15 weeks. The median time to PSA progression was not reached. Patients receiving three cycles of therapy were statistically more likely to experience a disease response when compared to those treated with one, two, or four cycles (p < 0.0001).

In order to investigate the CBZ-resistant mechanism, the establishment of a CBZ-resistant cell line is urgently needed. We established CBZ-resistant CRPC cell lines DU145CR and PC3CR by incubating DU145 and PC3 cells with gradually increasing concentrations of CBZ for approximately 2 years. We analyzed the gene expression profiles and cell cycle changes using microarray and flow cytometry. Pathway analysis revealed DU145CR cells had enhanced gene clusters of cell division and mitotic nuclear division. Enhancement of ERK signaling was detected in DU145CR cells. DU145CR cells had resistance to G2 /M arrest induced by CBZ through ERK signaling activation. The MEK inhibitor PD184352 significantly inhibited cell proliferation of DU145CR. In contrast to DU145CR, PC3CR cells had enhancement of PI3K/AKT signaling. The PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ 235 had a significant antitumor effect in PC3CR cells.

Conversely, the effect of cancer treatments on the composition of the GI microbiota is poorly understood. We hypothesized that oral androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies (ATT), including bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and abiraterone acetate, may be associated with compositional differences in the GI microbiota.  Methods:   We profiled the fecal microbiota in a cross-sectional study of 30 patients that included healthy male volunteers and men with different clinical states of prostate cancer (i.e., localized, biochemically recurrent, and metastatic disease) using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Functional inference of identified taxa was performed using PICRUSt.  Results:   We report a significant difference in alpha diversity in GI microbiota among men with versus without a prostate cancer diagnosis. Further analysis identified significant compositional differences in the GI microbiota of men taking ATT, including a greater abundance of species previously linked to response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Ruminococcaceae spp. In functional analyses, we found an enriched representation of bacterial gene pathways involved in steroid biosynthesis and steroid hormone biosynthesis in the fecal microbiota of men taking oral ATT.  Conclusions:   There are measurable differences in the GI microbiota of men receiving oral ATT. We speculate that oral hormonal therapies for prostate cancer may alter the GI microbiota, influence clinical responses to ATT, and/or potentially modulate the antitumor effects of future therapies including immunotherapy.

However, there are now other techniques of prostate biopsy aimed at improving outcomes such as patient comfort, significant cancer detection, and infectious complications. The purpose of the present study is to compare the cost and efficacy outcomes of five different approaches.  Methods:   We compared the comprehensive costs of a random sample size of 20-30 cases from each of the following: (1) local anesthesia TRUS-BX (reference), (2) sedation TRUS-BX, (3) general anesthesia transperineal template biopsy (TP), (4) sedation MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy (FB), and (5) sedation in-bore MRI biopsy (IB-MRI). Cost categories included pre-procedure, anesthesia pharmacy and recovery, and the technical/professional costs from urology, radiology, and pathology services. For procedure outcomes, we compared the larger cohorts of TRUS-BX, TP, and FB in terms of indication, cancer yield, and downstream decision impact.  Results:   Compared with standard TRUS-BX, the total costs of sedation TRUS-BX, TP, FB, and IB-MRI increased significantly ×1.9 (90%), ×2.5 (153%), ×2.5 (150%), and ×2.2 (125%), respectively (p < 0.001). Although there was no statistical difference between the total costs of TP, FB, and IB-MRI, these costs were significantly higher than those of TRUS-BX under either local anesthesia or sedation (p < 0.05). The cost of TRUS-BX under sedation was significantly higher than that of TRUS-BX under local anesthesia (p < 0.001). Compared to TRUS-BX, more significant cancers were detected in FB (16% vs. 36%) and TP (16% vs. 34%) groups (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Compared with standard TRUS-BX, the additions of imaging, sedation anesthesia, and transperineal template increase costs significantly, and can be considered along with known improvements in accuracy and side effects.

This concern has not been explored in other minority populations-specifically, Hispanic/Latino men. We recently found that Mexican-American men demonstrate an increased risk of PCa-specific mortality, and we hypothesized that they may also be at risk for an adverse outcome on AS.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, we extracted a population-based cohort of men diagnosed from 2004 to 2013 with localized or regional PCa, who had ≤2 cores of only Grade Group (GG) 1 cancer, and underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) with available biopsy and surgical pathology results. We measured discovery of high-risk PCa at RP and collected socioeconomic status (SES) data across different racial/ethnic groups. We defined aggressive tumors as either an upgrade to GG 3 or higher (GG3+) cancer or non-organ-confined disease (≥pT3a or N1). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to assess the association between racial/ethnic categories and the previously mentioned adverse oncologic outcomes both with and without adjusting for SES factors.  Results:   NHB and Mexican-American men were significantly more likely to have aggressive PCa, following RP. In multivariable logistic regression adjusting for SES factors and relative to non-Hispanic White (NHW) men, Mexican-American men had at increased odds of upgrading to GG3+ (OR 1.67; 95% CI [1.00-2.90]). NHB men were more likely to have non-organ-confined disease (OR 1.34; 95% CI [1.06-1.69]), while Mexican-American men had a similar risk to NHW men.  Conclusion:   Among individuals with low-risk PCa and eligible for AS, Mexican-American and NHB men are at an increased risk of harboring more aggressive disease at RP.

Survival was estimated for 13 cancer sites with cause-specific survival. Adjustments were made for common confounders (age, sex, year of diagnosis and place of residence) and defined mediators (stage at diagnosis, comorbidity and socioeconomic factors). A total of 500,255 subjects were available for analysis, of which 11,252 were Western and 8,701 non-Western immigrants.

Better lung cancer survival in non-Western immigrants than Norwegians was notable (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.78 (0.71-0.85)), and not explained by defined mediators. Immigrants from Eastern Europe and Balkan with melanoma (hazard ratio: 1.54 (1.12-2.12)) and prostate cancer (hazard ratio: 1.34 (1.08-1.67)), and possibly from sub-Saharan Africa with breast cancer (hazard ratio: 1.41 (0.94-2.12)) had worse survival than Norwegians.

In turn, chromatin structure contributes to nuclear stiffness, but the mechanosensing pathways regulating chromatin during cell migration remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5), an essential component of H3K4 methyltransferase complexes, regulates cell polarity, nuclear deformability, and migration of lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo, independent of transcriptional activity, suggesting nongenomic functions for WDR5. Similarly, depletion of RbBP5 (another H3K4 methyltransferase subunit) promotes similar defects. We reveal that a 3D environment increases the H3K4 methylation dependent on WDR5 and results in a globally less compacted chromatin conformation. Further, using atomic force microscopy, nuclear particle tracking, and nuclear swelling experiments, we detect changes in nuclear mechanics that accompany the epigenetic changes induced in 3D conditions. Indeed, nuclei from cells in 3D environments were softer, and thereby more deformable, compared with cells in suspension or cultured in 2D conditions, again dependent on WDR5. Dissecting the underlying mechanism, we determined that actomyosin contractility, through the phosphorylation of myosin by MLCK (myosin light chain kinase), controls the interaction of WDR5 with other components of the methyltransferase complex, which in turn up-regulates H3K4 methylation activation in 3D conditions. Taken together, our findings reveal a nongenomic function for WDR5 in regulating H3K4 methylation induced by 3D environments, physical properties of the nucleus, cell polarity, and cell migratory capacity.""","""['Pengbo Wang', 'Marcel Dreger', 'Elena Madrazo', 'Craig J Williams', 'Rafael Samaniego', 'Nigel W Hodson', 'Francisco Monroy', 'Esther Baena', 'Paloma Sánchez-Mateos', 'Adam Hurlstone', 'Javier Redondo-Muñoz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Squeezing cells through the epigenetic machinery.', 'Identification and characterization of the human Set1B histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase complex.', 'On the mechanism of multiple lysine methylation by the human mixed lineage leukemia protein-1 (MLL1) core complex.', 'A role for WDR5 in integrating threonine 11 phosphorylation to lysine 4 methylation on histone H3 during androgen signaling and in prostate cancer.', 'Diverse roles of WDR5-RbBP5-ASH2L-DPY30 (WRAD) complex in the functions of the SET1 histone methyltransferase family.', 'WRAD: enabler of the SET1-family of H3K4 methyltransferases.', 'Role of ROCK signaling in virus replication.', 'Tuning between Nuclear Organization and Functionality in Health and Disease.', 'Three-dimensional heart extracellular matrix enhances chemically induced direct cardiac reprogramming.', 'ROCK1/MLC2 inhibition induces decay of viral mRNA in BPXV infected cells.', 'Confined migration induces heterochromatin formation and alters chromatin accessibility.']"""

This study aimed to answer 3 questions for men who had a PSA test in the past year: (1) What percentage of these men received the test first suggested by physicians? (2) What factors were associated with physician-initiated PSA testing (PIPT) versus patient/someone else-initiated testing? (3) What percentage of patients ever had shared decision-making when tests were initiated by physicians?  Methods:   We analyzed the 2000 and 2015 National Health Interview Survey data. We calculated age-standardized prevalence of PIPT for both years. For 2015, we used logistic regression to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios for PIPT. We also calculated the prevalence of ever discussing both advantages and disadvantages.  Results:   The age-standardized prevalence of PIPT was significantly higher in 2015 (84.9%) than in 2000 (72.3%). In 2015, nearly 90% of PSA screenings for men aged ≥70 years were suggested by physicians. PIPT was positively associated with 2 or more comorbid conditions and number of patient visits to the doctor.

A total of 27 helical tomotherapy intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans covering 4 anatomical sites were selected, including 7 brain, 5 unilateral head and neck, 5 bilateral head and neck, 5 pelvis, and 5 prostate cases. All helical tomotherapy plans were converted to 7-field/9-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated radiotherapy plans through fallback dose-mimicking algorithm using a 6-MV beam model. The planning target volume (PTV) coverage ( D1, D99, and homogeneity index) and organs at risk dose constraints were evaluated and compared. Overall, all 3 techniques resulted in relatively inferior target dose coverage compared to helical tomotherapy plans, with higher homogeneity index and maximum dose. The organs at risk dose ratio of fallback to helical tomotherapy plans covered a wide spectrum, from 0.87 to 1.11 on average for all sites, with fallback plans being superior for brain, pelvis, and prostate sites. The quality of fallback plans depends on the delivery technique, field numbers, and angles, as well as user selection of structures for organs at risk. In actual clinical scenario, fallback plans would typically be needed for 1 to 5 fractions of a treatment course in the event of machine breakdown. Our results suggested that <1% dose variance can be introduced in target coverage and/or organs at risk from fallback plans. The presented clinical workflow showed that the fallback plan generation typically takes 10 to 20 minutes per case.

Objective:   To investigate gut bacterial diversity, identify specific metabolic pathways associated with disease, and develop a microbiome risk profile for prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   After prospective collection of 133 rectal swab samples 2 wk before the transrectal prostate biopsy, we perform 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on 105 samples (64 with cancer, 41 without cancer). Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) was applied to infer functional categories associated with taxonomic composition. The p values were adjusted using the false discovery rate. The α- and β-diversity analyses were performed using QIIME. The Mann-Whitney U test was employed to evaluate the statistical significance of β-diversity distances within and between groups of interest, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was used to determine pathway significance.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The detection of prostate cancer on transrectal prostate needle biopsy and 16s microbiome profile.  Results and limitations:   We identified significant associations between total community composition and cancer/non-cancer status (Bray-Curtis distance metric, p<0.01). We identified significant differences in enrichments of Bacteroides and Streptococcus species in cancer (all p<0.04). Folate (LDA 3.8) and arginine (LDA 4.1) were the most significantly altered pathways. We formed a novel microbiome-derived risk factor for prostate cancer based on 10 aberrant metabolic pathways (area under curve=0.64, p=0.02).  Conclusions:   Microbiome analyses on men undergoing prostate biopsy noted mostly similar bacterial species diversity among men diagnosed with and without prostate cancer. The microbiome may have subtle influences on prostate cancer but are likely patient-specific and would require paired analysis and precise manipulation, such as improvement of natural bacterial folate production.

Objective:   To determine the complication rate following different antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP; fosfomycin trometamol [FT] vs ß-lactame or fluorochinolones [FQ]) in patients undergoing TRBx or TPBx.  Design, setting, and participants:   The analyses were based on prospectively collected data of a cohort of patients who underwent TRBx or TPBx for elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA; ≥4ng/ml) or clinical suspicion of PCa, between September 2016 and March 2017. Patients received a single dose of 3g oral FT (group A) or, alternatively, FQ or ß-lactame (group B).  Intervention:   TRBx versus TPBx.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Adjustment variables consisted of age, PSA, biopsy technique (TPBx vs TRBx), and antibiotic prophylaxis (FT vs ß-lactame or FQ) using 1:1 propensity-score matching.

This work describes a method to infer voxel-level transformation from higher-level correspondence information contained in anatomical labels. We argue that such labels are more reliable and practical to obtain for reference sets of image pairs than voxel-level correspondence. Typical anatomical labels of interest may include solid organs, vessels, ducts, structure boundaries and other subject-specific ad hoc landmarks. The proposed end-to-end convolutional neural network approach aims to predict displacement fields to align multiple labelled corresponding structures for individual image pairs during the training, while only unlabelled image pairs are used as the network input for inference. We highlight the versatility of the proposed strategy, for training, utilising diverse types of anatomical labels, which need not to be identifiable over all training image pairs. At inference, the resulting 3D deformable image registration algorithm runs in real-time and is fully-automated without requiring any anatomical labels or initialisation. Several network architecture variants are compared for registering T2-weighted magnetic resonance images and 3D transrectal ultrasound images from prostate cancer patients.

Objectives:   Our goal is to analyze the perioperative, oncologic and functional outcomes of patients undergoing salvage robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (sRARP) after primary treatment failure.  Materials and methods:   Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed from a combined database of more than 14,800 patients who had undergone RARP. We identified 96 patients who underwent sRARP after RT or ablative techniques. Primary cancer characteristics, surgical data, pathology results, perioperative complications, oncologic and functional outcomes were analyzed.  Results:   Sixty-eight patients (70.8%) received some source of RT as a primary treatment. The remaining 28 patients: 18 (18.75%) received cryotherapy, seven (7.92%) HIFU, one electroporation, one microwave and one Tookad. complication was seen in 25 (26%) patients (21 minor and 4 major complications). Anastomotic leak was the most common complication, found in 14 (14.6%) of the cases. No rectal injuries occurred. Fourteen (15%) patients had a biochemical failure after a median follow-up of 14 (IQR 5-24) months. Fifty-five (57.3%) of them self-reported to be pad-free at 12 months. Seventeen (55%) of 31 pre-operative potent patients (SHIM score > 21), were potent with or without the use of PDE5i at 12 months.  Conclusions:   sRARP is a feasible alternative for PCa recurrence. Technically the procedure is challenging and should be performed by experienced PCa surgeons. Major complications are uncommon. Continence and potency recovery is possible, but at lower rates than for non-salvage patients.""","""['Gabriel Ogaya-Pinies', 'Estefania Linares-Espinos', 'Eduardo Hernandez-Cardona', 'Cathy Jenson', 'Xavier Cathelineau', 'Rafael Sanchez-Salas', 'Vipul Patel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Peri-operative, functional and early oncologic outcomes of salvage robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy after high-intensity focused ultrasound partial ablation.', 'Techniques and Outcomes of Salvage Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (sRARP).', 'Comparative Effectiveness Analyses of Salvage Prostatectomy and Salvage Radiotherapy Outcomes Following Focal or Whole-Gland Ablative Therapy (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound, Cryotherapy or Electroporation) for Localised Prostate Cancer.', 'Current status of salvage robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for radiorecurrent prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Focal salvage high-dose-rate brachytherapy with implantable rectum spacer for locally recurrent prostate cancer after initial low-dose-rate with grade 3 rectal toxicity.', 'Identification of a prognostic biomarker predicting biochemical recurrence and construction of a novel nomogram for prostate cancer.', 'Nightmares in Salvage Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy After Primary Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: A Step by Step Tutorial.', 'Outcomes of salvage radical prostatectomy after initial irreversible electroporation treatment for recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy following focal ablation with irreversible electroporation: feasibility, oncological and functional outcomes.']"""

Methods:   Patients scheduled for RARP were randomized into a 1:1 ratio to receive either s-DVC or d-DVC by two experienced surgeons. In s-DVC arm an eight-shaped single stitch was given at the beginning of the procedure and the DVC was subsequently cut at time of apical dissection; in d-DVC arm the plexus was transected at the end of prostatectomy, prior to apex dissection and then sutured. Primary endpoint was difference in estimated blood loss (EBL) and a sample size of 226 cases was calculated; ad interim analysis was planned after 2/3 of recruitment.  Results:   Endpoint was reached at ad interim analysis after 162 cases (81 s-DVC, 81 d-DVC) and recruitment was, therefore, interrupted. Baseline and tumor characteristics were overlapping. EBL was significantly higher in d-DVC arm (mean EBL 107 vs 65 ml, p = 0.003), but without differences in post-operative hemoglobin, transfusions and complications. Overall PSM rate was higher in d-DVC arm (21.0 vs 14.8%, p = 0.323), with statistical significance relatively to organ-confined disease (15.5 vs 3.6%, p = 0.031).

Palliative RT was more frequent in RCC (48.2%) in over than 10 pts per year.

E-cadherin loss of expression has been associated with poor prognosis; P-cadherin's role is still elusive. Although pT3 PCa is often considered ""high-risk cancer,"" it does not exhibit an uniformly poor prognosis. Herein, we assessed the prognostic value and survival impact of E-cadherin and P-cadherin immunoexpression in pT3 PCa. Radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens from 102 pT3 PCa patients treated between 1991 and 2014 in a single institution were designated for E-cadherin and P-cadherin immunoexpression analysis. A representative block from each specimen was selected for tissue micro-array (TMA) construction, using 3 cores per case. E-cadherin immunoexpression was assessed via a digital image analysis system. For P-cadherin, scoring criteria for HER2 in gastric cancer were used. Clinical records of all patients were reviewed for baseline clinical/pathologic characteristics and follow-up data. E-cadherin-low PCa patients displayed worse disease-specific survival (DSS), although not reaching statistical significance (HR 2.65, 95%CI 0.81-7.88). However, considering the pT3b group only, those with low E-cadherin immunoexpression displayed significantly worse overall-survival (OS) and DSS (HR 3.69, 95%CI 1.18-11.50; HR 5.90, 95%CI 1.40-24.81). No significant differences in survival were found for P-cadherin differential immunoexpression. Furthermore, an association between E-cadherin and P-cadherin immunoexpression (p = 0.019) was found, as among E-cadherin-low PCa, 96.6% were P-cadherin negative. We demonstrated that low E-cadherin immunoexpression discriminates among pT3b PCa patients those with poorer survival and which might benefit from specific therapy.

Downexpression of miR-133b has been reported to be implicated in the development, progression and recurrence in PCa. However, clinical significance and biological roles of miR-133b in bone metastasis of PCa remain unclear. Here we report that miR-133b is downregulated in PCa tissues and further decreased in bone metastatic PCa tissues. Downexpression of miR-133b positively correlates with advanced clinicopathological characteristics and shorter bone metastasis-free survival in PCa patients. Upregulating miR-133b inhibits invasion, migration in vitro and bone metastasis in vivo in PCa cells. Mechanistically, we find that miR-133b suppresses activity of TGF-β signaling via directly targeting TGF-β receptor I and II, which further inhibits bone metastasis of PCa cells. Our results further reveal that overexpression of REST contributes to miR-133b downexpression via transcriptional repression in PCa tissues.

The signal derived from Cu-doped Zn0.3Cd0.7S was amplified by hemin/G-quadruplex. Upon target PSA introduction, the aptamer-primer probe (apt-pri) was captured by capture antibody-conjugated magnetic bead (MB-mAb) to form the sandwiched MB-mAb/PSA/apt-pri. The complex could initiate the RCA reaction to produce a long single-stranded DNA that provided binding sites for G-rich DNA and to form long single-stranded DNA/G-quadruplex/hemin. Upon the addition of exonuclease III (Exo III), the hemin/G-quadruplex immobilized on the RCA long product could be released by the digestion of Exo III. The hemin/G-quadruplex complexes in this study were used as efficient electron acceptors to neutralize the photoelectrons generated from the semiconductor and hindered the recombination of charges, thus enhancing the photocurrent. Under the optimum conditions, the developed sensing system displayed a good analytical performance with a linear range of 0.05-40 ng mL-1 PSA and a detection limit of 16.3 pg mL-1. Furthermore, good selectivity, high anti-interference ability, satisfactory reproducibility, and good accuracy were also achieved.

Methods:   This is a retrospective study using HCUP-SID analyzing inpatient CA (pancreas, esophagus, lung, bladder, breast, colorectal, prostate, and gastric) admissions and surgeries pre- (2010-2013) and post- (2014) Medicaid expansion. Surgery was defined as observed resection rate per 100 cancer admissions. Nonexpansion (FL) and expansion states (IA, MD, and NY) were compared. A generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution and logistic regression was used with incidence rate ratios (IRR) and difference-in-differences (DID).  Results:   There were 317, 858 patients in our sample which included those with private insurance, Medicaid, or no insurance. Pancreas, breast, colorectal, prostate, and gastric CA admissions significantly increased in expansion states but decreased in nonexpansion states. (IRR 1.12, 1.14, 1.11, 1.34, 1.23; P < .05) Lung and colorectal CA surgeries (IRR 1.30, 1.25; P < .05) increased, while breast CA surgeries (IRR 1.25; P < .05) decreased less in expansion states. Government subsidized, or self-pay patients had greater odds of undergoing lung, bladder, and colorectal CA surgery (OR 0.45 vs 0.33; 0.60 vs 0.48; 0.47 vs 0.39; P < .05) in expansion states after reform.  Conclusions:   In states that expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA, the rate of surgeries for colorectal and lung CA increased significantly, while breast CA surgeries decreased less. Parenthetically, these cancers are subject to population screening programs.

Therefore, the search for novel agents, which induce apoptosis in cancer cells while displaying limited toxicity towards normal cells, is paramount. The olive biophenols, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, have displayed cytotoxicity towards cancer cells without affecting non-tumorigenic cells in cancers of the breast and prostate. However, their activity in pancreatic cancer has not been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the anti-pancreatic cancer potential of oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol. Pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2, BxPC-3, and CFPAC-1) and non-tumorigenic pancreas cells (HPDE) were treated with oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol to determine their effect on cell viability. Oleuropein displayed selective toxicity towards MIA PaCa-2 cells and hydroxytyrosol towards MIA PaCa-2 and HPDE cells. Subsequent analysis of Bcl-2 family proteins and caspase 3/7 activation determined that oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol induced apoptosis in MIA PaCa-2 cells, while oleuropein displayed a protective effect on HPDE cells.

The clinical applicability of the technique was discussed.  Material and methods:   ERB inflation makes the EBT3 films unrolled, whereas its deflation makes them rolled. Patient-specific quality assurance (pQA) tests were performed in 20 patient plans using an Ir-192 remote afterloading system and a water-filled cervical phantom with the ERB. The dose distributions measured in ERBs were compared with those of the treatment plans.  Results:   The absolute dose profiles measured by the ERBs were in good agreement with those of treatment plans. The global gamma passing rates were 96-100% and 91-100% over 20 pQAs under the criteria of 3%/3 mm and 3%/2 mm, respectively, with a 30% low-dose threshold. Dose-volume histograms of the rectal wall were obtained from the measured dose distributions and showed small volume differences less than 2% on average from the patients' plans over the entire dose interval. The positioning error of the applicator set was detectable with high sensitivity of 12% dose area variation per mm. Additionally, the clinical applicability of the ERB was evaluated in volunteers, and none of them felt any pain when the ERB was inserted or removed.

Although dose escalation increases local control, toxicity hampers further escalation. Broader improvement will be possible by the addition of adjuvant therapies, which can synergize with radiation and thus improve efficacy. We have identified a natural compound (Nexrutine, Nx) that inhibits the survival and growth of PCa cells in combination with radiation. Combination studies demonstrated strong interaction between Nx and radiation both in vitro in multiple PCa cell lines and in the Transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. Nx potentiated growth inhibitory effects of IR by down regulating ribosomal protein S6K (RPS6KB1), CyclinD1, Chk1 and HIF-1 α and prolonging G2/M checkpoint block. RPS6KB1 is upregulated in prostate cancers and its expression is correlated with tumor grade.

The system allows the distribution of thermal signal intensity as a function of emissivity to be interpreted from the integrated absorbance obtained by spectroscopic imaging. Biochemical differences between cancer and benign areas within the specimens are identified in the spectra. Side-by-side comparison of H&E stained adjacent tissue sections with infrared images constructed before and after the removal of thermal effect showed that the latter strongly support differentiation of regions within tissues. The use of spectral bands at discrete wavelengths significantly reduced spectral acquisition time, making this technique promising as a future clinical diagnostic tool. A systemic methodology was implemented to process the data, first by k-means clustering on the second derivative spectra without a priori knowledge, followed by principal component analysis (PCA). Four distinct regions within the tissue samples were successfully classified based on the antisymmetric stretching mode of the methylene functional group. Separation between data in clusters occurs when projecting spectra on a PCA score plot on a plane made by first 2 principal components. The significance of the disparity was verified with statistical test.

This study compared five nomograms to clinical data from dynamic modified-peripheral intraoperative PSI to determine (a) the cause of excess seeds and (b) the optimal nomogram for our institution. Pre- and intraoperative patient data were collected for monotherapy PSIs and compiled into a clinical database. All patients were prescribed 125 Gy with dose coverage of D90% = 100% to the planning target volume (PTV) using 103 Pd seeds with mean air-kerma strength ( SK¯ ) of 2 U. Seeds were ordered based upon an in-house nomogram as a function of preoperative prostate volume and prescription dose. Preoperative prostate volume was assessed with transrectal ultrasound. If any of the following four conditions were not met: (a) preoperative volume = intraoperative volume, (b) D90% = 100%, (c) SK¯=2U , and (d) seed ordering matched the in-house nomogram, then a normalization factor was applied to the number of seeds used intraoperatively to meet all four conditions. Four published nomograms, an in-house nomogram, and the normalized number of implanted seeds for each patient were plotted against intraoperative prostate volume. Of the 226 patients, 223 had excess seeds at the completion of their PSI. On average, 25.7 ± 9.9% of ordered seeds were not implanted. Excess seeds were separated into two categories, accounted-for excess, determined by the four normalization factors, and residual excess, assumed to be due to overordering.

Whether bariatric surgery influences the risk of obesity-related cancer is not clear. This study aimed to uncover the risk of hormone-related (breast, endometrial and prostate), colorectal and oesophageal cancers following obesity surgery.  Methods:   This national population-based cohort study used data from the Hospital Episode Statistics database in England collected between 1997 and 2012. Propensity matching on sex, age, co-morbidity and duration of follow-up was used to compare cancer risk among obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery (gastric bypass, gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy) and obese individuals not undergoing such surgery. Conditional logistic regression provided odds ratios (ORs) with 95 per cent confidence intervals.  Results:   In the study period, from a cohort of 716 960 patients diagnosed with obesity, 8794 patients who underwent bariatric surgery were matched exactly with 8794 obese patients who did not have surgery. Compared with the no-surgery group, patients who had bariatric surgery exhibited a decreased risk of hormone-related cancers (OR 0·23, 95 per cent c.i. 0·18 to 0·30). This decrease was consistent for breast (OR 0·25, 0·19 to 0·33), endometrium (OR 0·21, 0·13 to 0·35) and prostate (OR 0·37, 0·17 to 0·76) cancer. Gastric bypass resulted in the largest risk reduction for hormone-related cancers (OR 0·16, 0·11 to 0·24). Gastric bypass, but not gastric banding or sleeve gastrectomy, was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR 2·63, 1·17 to 5·95). Longer follow-up after bariatric surgery strengthened these diverging associations.  Conclusion:   Bariatric surgery is associated with decreased risk of hormone-related cancers, whereas gastric bypass might increase the risk of colorectal cancer.""","""['H Mackenzie', 'S R Markar', 'A Askari', 'O Faiz', 'M Hull', 'S Purkayastha', 'H Møller', 'J Lagergren']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Br J Surg""","""[]"""

Experience with outpatient RARP has been reported as early as 2010. In this study, we evaluate the safety and feasibility of outpatient RARP by comparing perioperative outcomes between patients undergoing outpatient RARP to patients discharged on the day following surgery. This is a single-institution retrospective cohort study. Patients with localized disease who underwent RARP without pelvic lymph node dissection from September 2017 to January 2018 were included. T tests and Chi-squared analysis were used to compare demographic and perioperative characteristics of patients who were discharged on the same day of surgery (outpatient RARP) to patients discharged on the day after surgery (inpatient RARP). Of the 51 patients included in the study, 26 underwent outpatient RARP while 25 underwent inpatient RARP. There was no significant difference in mean age (61.4 vs 65.8 years, p = 0.05), BMI (27.1 vs 28.3 kg/m2, p = 0.35), ethnicity, tobacco use (8 vs 15%, p = 0.41), PSA (8.7 vs 8.4 ng/dL, p = 0.77), biopsy Gleason score distribution, prostate size (51.8 vs 57.7 cc, p = 0.26) or preoperative hemoglobin (14.3 vs 13.4 g/dL, p = 0.06), respectively. There was no significant difference between operative time (95.3 vs 101 min, p = 0.16), EBL (52.8 vs 66.5 cc, p = 0.08), postoperative change in hemoglobin (- 1 vs - 1.1 g/dL, p = 0.62), pathologic stage distribution or complication rate (4 vs 8%, p = 0.58) between patients who underwent outpatient vs inpatient RARP, respectively. Outpatient RARP offers similar or improved perioperative outcomes when compared to inpatient RARP.

Epidemiologists have concerns that an unintended consequence is a problematic increase in high-risk disease and subsequent prostate cancer-specific mortality.  Materials and methods:   To assess the effect of decreased PSA screening on the presentation of high-risk prostate cancer post-radical prostatectomy (RP). Nine high-volume referral centers throughout the United States (n = 19,602) from October 2008 through September 2016 were assessed and absolute number of men presenting with GS ≥ 8, seminal vesicle and lymph node invasion were compared with propensity score matching.  Results:   Compared to the 4-year average pre-(Oct. 2008-Sept. 2012) versus post-(Oct. 2012-Sept. 2016) recommendation, a 22.6% reduction in surgical volume and increases in median PSA (5.1-5.8 ng/mL) and mean age (60.8-62.0 years) were observed. The proportion of low-grade GS 3 + 3 cancers decreased significantly (30.2-17.1%) while high-grade GS 8 + cancers increased (8.4-13.5%). There was a 24% increase in absolute numbers of GS 8+ cancers. One-year biochemical recurrence rose from 6.2 to 17.5%. To discern whether increases in high-risk disease were due to referral patterns, propensity score matching was performed. Forest plots of odds ratios adjusted for age and PSA showed significant increases in pathologic stage, grade, and lymph node involvement.

Methods:   Retrospective observational study of 252 patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis of the French Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndrome Reference Center. Patients were classified in three groups: (1) non-malignant ovarian teratomas, (2) malignant ovarian teratomas (immature), and (3) other malignant tumors.  Results:   Sixty patients (23.8%) had an associated tumor and 15 (6%) were malignant. No particular neurological symptom was observed in these patients. Ovarian teratomas were the most frequent (51 cases) with 6 of them immature (11.8% of teratomas).

First, the phenolic compounds gallic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin, kaempferol and chrysin were quantified in the honeys using high performance liquid chromatography, and found in nanomolar concentrations. In a Boyden chamber-based migration assay, non-toxic concentrations of thyme and honeydew honeys reduced cell migration by 20%, and all phenolic compounds except caffeic acid also lowered migration, although a mixture of only the sugars found in honey had no effect. All of the honeys, phenolics and the sugar-only mixture reduced invasive movement of cells through extracellular matrix by up to 75%. Most notably, each of the three honeys and the sugar-only mixture reduced cell adhesion to collagen I by 90%. With the exception of quercetin, phenolic compounds did not reduce adhesion. Therefore, honey and its sugar and phenolic components can lower the metastatic properties of cancer cells, and may do this by preventing effective cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix.

Objective:   To assess the performance of combining a blood-based biomarker panel and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsies for prostate cancer detection.  Design, setting, and participants:   We used a prospective, multicenter, paired diagnostic study design. A total of 532 men aged 45-74 yr referred for prostate cancer workup were included during 2016-2017.  Intervention:   Participants underwent blood sampling for analysis of the Stockholm3 test including protein biomarkers, genetic polymorphisms, and clinical variables; 1.5 T MRI; systematic prostate biopsies; and MRI-targeted biopsies to lesions with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 ≥3.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The main outcome was numbers of detected prostate cancer characterized by grade group (GG) and the number of performed biopsies using relative sensitivity (RS).  Results and limitations:   Median prostate-specific antigen was 6.3 ng/ml, and mean age was 63.9 yr. Targeted and systematic biopsies detected 170 and 162 GG ≥2 tumors, respectively (RS 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.14). Compared with performing systematic biopsies on all men, performing targeted and systematic biopsies only on men with >10% risk of GG ≥2 cancer, as predicted by the Stockholm3 test, required 62% (95% CI 58-66) of the biopsy procedures and detected 58% (95% CI 48-70) of GG 1 disease, with increased sensitivity for GG ≥2 detection (RS 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.17). Performing only targeted biopsies in men with elevated Stockholm3 test altered these results only slightly. Compared with performing systematic and targeted biopsies on all men, performing this only for men with an elevated Stockholm3 test decreased detection of GG ≥2 cancer slightly (RS 0.92; 95% CI 0.88-0.95). Limitations include lacking knowledge of true disease prevalence.  Conclusions:   These findings provide evidence that strategies combining the blood-based Stockholm3 test and MRI-targeted biopsies can be used to inform biopsy decision making.  Patient summary:   In this study, 532 men coming for prostate cancer workup underwent blood sampling, and both traditional and magnetic resonance imaging/fusion-guided prostate biopsies. We report that performing targeted biopsies only in men with an elevated risk as assessed by the Stockholm3 test saved biopsies, decreased overdetection, and maintained the number of detected high-grade cancers.""","""['Henrik Grönberg', 'Martin Eklund', 'Wolfgang Picker', 'Markus Aly', 'Fredrik Jäderling', 'Jan Adolfsson', 'Martin Landquist', 'Erik Skaaheim Haug', 'Peter Ström', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Tobias Nordström']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Tradeoffs in Refining the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', ""Reply to Erik Rud, Peter Lauritzen, and Eduard Baco's Letter to the Editor re: Henrik Grönberg, Martin Eklund, Wolfgang Picker, et al.

Methods:   We collaborated with a biopsy needle manufacturer and developed a novel biopsy instrument (PRIMECUT II long-notch type) with a 25-mm side-notch length and 28-mm stroke length to take longer tissue cores. The sampled core length, cancer detection rate, pain and complications of 489 patients who underwent transrectal biopsy using the long-notch needle were compared with those of 469 patients who underwent biopsy using a normal instrument with a 19-mm side-notch length and 22-mm stroke length.  Results:   The mean length of tissue taken by the long-notch needle was significantly longer than that of tissue taken by the normal-notch needle (16.3 vs 22.4 mm, P < 0.001). The overall cancer detection rate was 42.0% for the normal-notch needle and 51.1% for the long-notch needle (P = 0.005). In patients with a prostate volume of 20-40 mL, the cancer detection rate for the long-notch needle was especially higher than that for the normal-notch needle (74.2% vs 47.5%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the long-notch needle improved cancer detection significantly (odds ratio 1.702, P < 0.001).

The cause of this is unclear, but several lines of evidence indicate it is largely due to overdiagnosis, the diagnosis of tumors that would have never manifest clinically if untreated. Practices leading to overdiagnosis may relate to defensive medicine. In this study, we evaluated the association between malpractice climate and incidence of thyroid, breast, prostate, colon, and lung cancer in U.S. states from 1999-2012 using publicly available government data. State-level malpractice risk was quantified as malpractice payout rate, the number of malpractice payouts per 100,000 people per state per year. Associations between state-level cancer incidence, malpractice payout rate, and several cancer risk factors were evaluated. Risk factors included several social determinants of health, including factors predicting healthcare access. States with higher malpractice payout rate had higher thyroid cancer incidence, on both univariate analysis (r = 0.51, P = 0.009, Spearman) and multivariate analysis (P<0.001, multilevel model). In contrast, state-level malpractice payout rate was not associated with incidence of any other cancer type. Malpractice climate may be a social determinant for being diagnosed with thyroid cancer. This may be a product of greater defensive medicine in states with higher malpractice risk, which leads to increased diagnostic testing of patients with thyroid nodules and potential overdiagnosis. Alternatively, malpractice risk may be a proxy for another, unmeasured risk factor.""","""['Brandon Labarge', 'Vonn Walter', 'Eugene J Lengerich', 'Henry Crist', 'Dipti Karamchandani', 'Nicole Williams', 'David Goldenberg', 'Darrin V Bann', 'Joshua I Warrick']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Catastrophic medical malpractice payouts in the United States.', 'Current thyroid cancer trends in the United States.', 'Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer: answers to five key questions.', 'Thyroidectomy-related malpractice claims.', 'Growing incidence of thyroid carcinoma in recent years: Factors underlying overdiagnosis.', 'Different Threshold of Malignancy for RAS-like Thyroid Tumors Causes Significant Differences in Thyroid Nodule Practice.', 'Current Iodine Nutrition Status and Morbidity of Thyroid Nodules in Mainland China in the Past 20 Years.', 'Atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance: Asian vs. non-Asian practice, and the Singapore experience.', 'Litigation in thyroid cytology and histopathology in England: a very brief overview.', 'Analysis of lncRNA and mRNA Transcriptomes Expression in Thyroid Cancer Tissues Among Patients With Exposure of Medical Occupational Radiation.']"""

No study examining the role of diet-associated inflammation in PrCA has been conducted in Latin America.  Method:   We examined the association between the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®) and PrCA in a population-based case-control study in Córdoba, Argentina. A total of 153 incident cases of PrCA and 309 controls frequency matched on sex, age (± 5 years), and place of residence were recruited from 2008 to 2015. The DII was developed to determine the inflammatory potential of individuals' diets and was computed from a validated food frequency questionnaire using nutrient data from diet only. Multi-level logistic regression models were fit to evaluate the association between DII scores and PrCA, adjusting for age, body mass index, energy intake, and occupational exposure as first-level covariates and family history of prostate cancer as the second-level variable. Odds ratios were estimated in all subject and stratified by BMI (< 30 vs. ≥ 30 kg/m2).  Results:   Men in the most pro-inflammatory group (tertile 3) had 50% higher odds of having PrCA compared to men in the most anti-inflammatory group (tertile 1) (ORtertile3 vs. tertile1 1.50; 95% CI 1.24-1.80). The odds of prostate cancer were higher in obese men (n = 109, ORtertile3 vs. tertile1 1.81; 95% CI 1.45-2.27), while no association was found among non-obese men (n = 375, ORtertile3 vs. tertile1 0.93; 95% CI 0.25-3.51).  Conclusions:   A pro-inflammatory diet, reflected by higher DII scores, was positively associated with PrCA occurrence. Based on these results and those from other studies, steps should be taken to promote a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods, in order to reduce risk of PrCA and other chronic diseases.

Epigenetic regulators have been identified as important targets for prostate cancer chemoprevention. Treatment of human prostate cancer cells with sulforaphane (SFN), a chemical from broccoli and broccoli sprouts, inhibits epigenetic regulators such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes, but it is not known whether consumption of a diet high in broccoli sprouts impacts epigenetic mechanisms in an in vivo model of prostate cancer.  Objective:   In the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model, we tested the hypothesis that a broccoli sprout diet suppresses prostate cancer, inhibits HDAC expression, alters histone modifications, and changes the expression of genes regulated by HDACs.  Methods:   TRAMP mice were fed a 15% broccoli sprout or control AIN93G diet; tissue samples were collected at 12 and 28 wk of age.  Results:   Mice fed broccoli sprouts had detectable amounts of SFN metabolites in liver, kidney, colon, and prostate tissues. Broccoli sprouts reduced prostate cancer incidence and progression to invasive cancer by 11- and 2.4-fold at 12 and 28 wk of age, respectively. There was a significant decline in HDAC3 protein expression in the epithelial cells of prostate ventral and anterior lobes at age 12 wk. Broccoli sprout consumption also decreased histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation in the ventral lobe (age 12 wk), and decreased histone H3 lysine 18 acetylation in all prostate lobes (age 28 wk). A decline in p16 mRNA levels, a gene regulated by HDAC3, was associated with broccoli sprout consumption, but no significant changes were noted at the protein level.

Materials and methods:   The prospective, ethics committee approved PICTURE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01492270) enrolled 249 consecutive patients from January 11, 2012 to January 29, 2014. Men underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and were blinded to the results. All underwent transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies. In 200 men with a lesion this was preceded by visual estimation and image fusion targeted biopsies. As the primary study end point clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as Gleason 4 + 3 or greater and/or any grade of cancer with a length of 6 mm or greater. Other definitions of clinically significant prostate cancer were also evaluated.  Results:   Mean ± SD patient age was 62.6 ± 7 years, median prostate specific antigen was 7.17 ng/ml (IQR 5.25-10.09), mean primary lesion size was 0.37 ± 1.52 cc with a mean of 4.3 ± 2.3 targeted cores per lesion on visual estimation and image fusion combined, and a mean of 48.7 ± 12.3 transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy cores. Transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies detected 97 clinically significant prostate cancers (48.5%) and 85 insignificant cancers (42.5%). Overall multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsies detected 81 clinically significant prostate cancers (40.5%) and 63 insignificant cancers (31.5%). In the 18 cases (9%) of clinically significant prostate cancer on magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsies were benign or clinically insignificant on transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy. Clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in 34 cases (17%) on transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy but not on magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsies and approximately half was present in nontargeted areas. Clinically significant prostate cancer was found on visual estimation and image fusion in 53 (31.3%) and 48 (28.4%) of the 169 patients (McNemar test p = 0.5322). Visual estimation missed 23 clinically significant prostate cancers (13.6%) detected by image fusion. Image fusion missed 18 clinically significant prostate cancers (10.8%) detected by visual estimation.  Conclusions:   Magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsies are accurate for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer and reducing the over diagnosis of insignificant cancers. To maximize detection visual estimation as well as image fusion targeted biopsies are required.""","""['Lucy A M Simmons', 'Abi Kanthabalan', 'Manit Arya', 'Tim Briggs', 'Dean Barratt', 'Susan C Charman', 'Alex Freeman', 'David Hawkes', 'Yipeng Hu', 'Charles Jameson', 'Neil McCartan', 'Caroline M Moore', 'Shonit Punwani', 'Jan van der Muelen', 'Mark Emberton', 'Hashim U Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Patient Reported Outcome Measures for Transperineal Template Prostate Mapping Biopsies in the PICTURE Study.', 'Accuracy of real-time magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided transperineal target biopsy with needle tracking with a mechanical position-encoded stepper in detecting significant prostate cancer in biopsy-naïve men.', 'A Multicentre Analysis of the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Following Transperineal Image-fusion Targeted and Nontargeted Systematic Prostate Biopsy in Men at Risk.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Transperineal US-MRI Fusion-Guided Biopsy for the Detection of Clinical Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Comparing Cognitive and Software-Assisted Technique.', 'Landmarks in the evolution of prostate biopsy.', 'A comparative study of transperineal software-assisted magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion biopsy and transrectal cognitive fusion biopsy of the prostate.', 'Evidence-based guideline recommendations on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer: A Cancer Care Ontario updated clinical practice guideline.', 'Optimal biopsy approach for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.']"""

We report functional and oncological postoperative outcomes up to 24 months after surgery for these two surgical techniques.  Methods:   In this randomised controlled phase 3 study, men who had newly diagnosed clinically localised prostate cancer and who had chosen surgery as their treatment approach, and were aged between 35 years and 70 years were eligible and recruited from the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (Brisbane, QLD, Australia). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to have either robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy or open radical retropubic prostatectomy. Randomisation was computer generated and occurred in blocks of ten. This was an open trial; however, study investigators involved in data analysis were masked to each patient's surgical treatment. Primary outcomes were urinary function (urinary domain of Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC]) and sexual function (sexual domain of EPIC and International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire [IIEF]) at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months and oncological outcome (biochemical recurrence and imaging evidence of progression). The trial was powered to assess health-related and domain-specific quality-of-life outcomes over 24 months. All analyses were done on a per-protocol basis. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12611000661976.  Findings:   Between Aug 23, 2010, and Nov 25, 2014, 326 men were enrolled, of whom 163 were randomly assigned to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and 163 to open radical retropubic prostatectomy. 18 withdrew (12 assigned to radical retropubic prostatectomy and six assigned to robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy); thus, 151 in the radical retropubic prostatectomy group and 157 in the robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group proceeded to surgery. At the 24-month follow-up time point, 150 men remained in the robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group and 146 remained in the open radical retropubic prostatectomy group. Urinary function scores did not differ significantly between robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and open radical retropubic prostatectomy at 6 months post-surgery (88·68 [95% CI 86·79-90·58] vs 88·45 [86·54-90·36]; p1<0·0001, p2<0·0001), 12 months post-surgery (90·76 [88·89-92·62] vs 91·53 [90·07-92·98]; p1<0·0001, p2<0·0001), or 24 months post-surgery (91·33 [89·64-93·03] vs 90·86 [89·01-92·70]; p1<0·0001, p2<0·0001). Sexual function scores were not significantly different between robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and open radical retropubic prostatectomy at 6 months post-surgery (EPIC: 37·40 [33·60-41·19] vs 38·63 [34·76-42·49], p1=0·0001, p2<0·0001; IIEF: 29·75 [26·66-32·84] vs 29·78 [26·41-33·16], p1<0·0001, p2<0·0001), 12 months post-surgery (EPIC: 42·28 [38·05-46·51] vs 42·51 [38·29-46·72], p1<0·0001, p2<0·0001; IIEF: 33·10 [29·59-36·61] vs 33·50 [29·87-37·13], p1=0·0002, p2<0·0001), or 24 months post-surgery (EPIC: 45·70 [41·17-50·23] vs 46·90 [42·20-51·60], p1=0·0003, p2<0·0001; IIEF: 33·95 [30·11-37·78] vs 33·89 [29·82-37·96], p1=0·0003, p2=0·0004). Equivalence testing on the difference between the proportion of biochemical recurrences between the two groups (13 [9%] in the open radical retropubic prostatectomy group vs four [3%] in the robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy group) showed that equality between the two techniques could not be established based on a 90% CI with a prespecified margin of 10%. However, a superiority test showed that the two proportions were significantly different (p=0·0199). Equivalence testing on the proportion of patients who had imaging evidence of progression revealed that the two groups were not significantly different (p=0·2956).  Interpretation:   Robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy and open radical retropubic prostatectomy yielded similar functional outcomes at 24 months. We advise caution in interpreting the oncological outcomes of our study because of the absence of standardisation in postoperative management between the two trial groups and the use of additional cancer treatments. Clinicians and patients should view the benefits of a robotic approach as being largely related to its minimally invasive nature.

In this analysis we included 621 cases of prostate and 1,205 of breast cancer and 872 male and 1,321 female population controls who had never worked night shift. Subjects were interviewed on timing of meals, sleep and chronotype and completed a Food Frequency Questionaire.

Compared with subjects sleeping immediately after supper, those sleeping two or more hours after supper had a 20% reduction in cancer risk for breast and prostate cancer combined (adjusted Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.80, 95%CI 0.67-0.96) and in each cancer individually (prostate cancer OR = 0.74, 0.55-0.99; breast cancer OR = 0.84, 0.67-1.06). A similar protection was observed in subjects having supper before 9 pm compared with supper after 10 pm. The effect of longer supper-sleep interval was more pronounced among subjects adhering to cancer prevention recommendations (OR both cancers= 0.65, 0.44-0.97) and in morning types (OR both cancers = 0.66, 0.49-0.90).

Summary answer:   About 200 genes are differentially expressed in the caput HEE cells after AR activation; the AR transcriptional network is tissue-specific and may be mediated in part by distinct AR co-factors including CAAT-enhancer binding protein beta (CEBPB) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1).  What is known already:   Little is known about the AR transcriptional program genome wide in HEE cells, nor its co-factors in those cells. AR has been best studied in the prostate gland epithelium and prostate cancer cell lines, due to the important role of this factor in prostate cancer. However AR-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and AR co-factors have not yet been compared between human epididymis and prostate epithelial cells.  Study design, size, duration:   Caput HEE cells from two donors were exposed to the synthetic androgen R1881 at 1 nM for 12-16 h after 72 h of hormone starvation.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   Chromatin was prepared from R1881-treated and vehicle control HEE cells. AR-associated chromatin was purified by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and AR occupancy genome wide was revealed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). Two independent biological replicates were performed. Total RNA was prepared from R1881 and control-treated HEE cells and gene expression profiles were documented by RNA-seq. The interaction of the potential novel AR co-factors CEBPB and RUNX1, identified through in-silico motif analysis of AR ChIP-seq data, was examined by ChIP-qPCR after siRNA-mediated depletion of each co-factor individually or simultaneously.  Main results and the role of chance:   The results identify about 200 genes that are differentially expressed (DEGs) in HEE cells after AR activation. Some of these DEGs show occupancy of AR at their promoters or cis-regulatory elements suggesting direct regulation. However, there is little overlap in AR-associated DEGs between HEE and prostate epithelial cells. Inspection of over-represented motifs in AR ChIP-seq peaks identified CEBPB and RUNX1 as potential co-factors, with no evidence for FOXA1, which is an important co-factor in the prostate epithelium. CEBPB and RUNX1 ChIP-seq in HEE cells showed that both these factors often occupied AR-binding sites, though rarely simultaneously. Further analysis at a single AR-regulated locus (FK506-binding protein 5, FKPB5) suggests that CEBPB may be a co-activator. These data suggest a novel AR transcriptional network governs differentiated functions of the human epididymis epithelium.  Large scale data:   AR ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data are deposited at GEO: GSE109063.  Limitations, reasons for caution:   There is substantial donor-to-donor variation in primary HEE cells cultures. We applied stringent statistical tests with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1% for ChIP-seq and standard pipelines for RNA-seq so it is possible that we have missed some AR-regulated genes that are important in caput epididymis function.  Wider implications of the findings:   Our data suggest that a novel AR transcriptional network governs differentiated functions of the human epididymis epithelium. Since this cell layer has a critical role in normal sperm maturation, the results are of broader significance in understanding the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of fertility in men.

The objective of this study was to develop multivariable NTCP models for these side effects.  Material and methods:   This prospective cohort study was composed of 243 patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer (stage T1-3). Genito-urinary (GU) toxicity was assessed using a standardized follow-up program. The GU toxicity endpoints were scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE 3.0) scoring system. The full bladder and different anatomical subregions within the bladder were delineated. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression analysis was used to analyze dose volume effects on the four individual endpoints.  Results:   In the univariable analysis, urinary incontinence was significantly associated with dose distributions in the trigone (V55-V75, mean). Hematuria was significantly associated with the bladder wall dose (V40-V75, mean), bladder dose (V70-V75), cardiovascular disease and anticoagulants use. Pain during urinating was associated with the dose to the trigone (V50-V75, mean) and with trans transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). In the final multivariable model urinary incontinence was associated with the mean dose of the trigone. Hematuria was associated with bladder wall dose (V75) and cardiovascular disease, while pain during urinating was associated with trigone dose (V75) and TURP. No significant associations were found for increase in voiding frequency.  Conclusions:   Radiation-induced urinary side effects are associated with dose distributions to different organs as risk. Given the dose effect relationships found, decreasing the dose to the trigone and bladder wall may reduce the incidence of incontinence, pain during voiding and hematuria, respectively.""","""['Wouter Schaake', 'Arjen van der Schaaf', 'Lisanne V van Dijk', 'Alfons C M van den Bergh', 'Johannes A Langendijk']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models for late rectal bleeding, stool frequency and fecal incontinence after radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'External beam radiation therapy after transurethral resection of the prostate: a report on acute and late genitourinary toxicity.', 'Voxel-Based Analysis for Identification of Urethrovesical Subregions Predicting Urinary Toxicity After Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Urinary morbidity and incontinence following transurethral resection of the prostate after brachytherapy.', 'Is there an increase in genitourinary toxicity in patients treated with transurethral resection of the prostate and radiotherapy?

Qualitative analyses comprised Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) and modified PI-RADSv2 (mPI-RADSv2). Quantitative analyses comprised mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of tumor, 10th percentile ADC of tumor, mean ADC ratio (ADCR) between benign tissues and PCa, and 10th percentile ADCR between benign tissues and PCa. The AUCs of the following combined models for GS 7 or greater PCa were investigated: model 1, PSAD and PI-RADSv2; model 2, PSAD and mPI-RADSv2; model 3, PSAD and mean ADC; model 4, PSAD and 10th percentile ADC; model 5, PSAD and mean ADCR; and model 6, PSAD and 10th percentile ADCR.

It is characterized by early and widespread metastases, and has the ability to rapidly develop resistance to chemotherapy. Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7), a member of the BMP family of signaling molecules, has been implicated in various types of cancer, particularly prostate cancer and breast cancer. However, there is little knowledge of the function of BMP7 in SCLC. The aim of the present study was to investigate the biological function of recombinant human (rh)BMP7 on SCLC cells and the underlying molecular basis for this regulatory mechanism. The effect of rhBMP7 on SCLC cell lines and associated signaling pathways was investigated. Results suggested that rhBMP7 significantly inhibited the proliferation, motility and invasion of SBC-3 and SBC-5 cells. However, rhBMP7 exhibited no effect on the apoptosis of SBC-5 cells, but promoted apoptosis of SBC-3 cells. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis revealed that rhBMP7 was able to increase the proportion of cells in G1 phase and decrease the S phase proportion. Total and membrane BMP receptor (BMPR)IA and BMPRIB were highly expressed in SBC-5 cells, whereas cytoplasmic BMPRIA and BMPRIB expression was higher in SBC-3 cells. However, activin A receptor type I expression was higher in SBC-3 cells in total and cytoplasmic proteins. Furthermore, following stimulation with rhBMP7, Smad2, Smad4 and p21 were downregulated. We hypothesized that rhBMP7 inhibited the progressiveness of SCLC cells by inducing G1 phase arrest and inhibiting S phase entry. The results of the present study indicated that BMP7 serves a key function in regulating the progression of SCLC.""","""['Weiwei Shen', 'Hailin Pang', 'Bo Xin', 'Lian Duan', 'Lili Liu', 'Helong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['The Biological Effects of Dickkopf1 on Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells and Bone Metastasis.', 'MGr1-Ag promotes invasion and bone metastasis of small-cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'miR-335 inhibits small cell lung cancer bone metastases via IGF-IR and RANKL pathways.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins and its receptors; therapeutic targets in cancer progression and bone metastasis?', 'Organotypic Epithelial Raft Cultures as a Three-Dimensional In Vitro Model of Merkel Cell Carcinoma.', 'The Prognostic Value of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins and Their Receptors in Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Understanding Lung Carcinogenesis from a Morphostatic Perspective: Prevention and Therapeutic Potential of Phytochemicals for Targeting Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Expression of bone morphogenetic protein 10 in cases with endometrial carcinoma and its clinical significance.', 'Anti‑proliferative effect of honokiol on SW620\xa0cells through upregulating BMP7 expression via the TGF‑β1/p53 signaling pathway.']"""

The present study also reported high expression of HES6 in 138/213 (64.8%) paraffin-embedded archived CRC specimens. HES6 expression was significantly correlated with T classification (P<0.001), N classification (P=0.020), and distant metastasis (P<0.001). Patients with higher HES6 expression levels exhibited a reduced overall survival (P<0.001). In addition, a multivariate analysis revealed that the expression of HES6 may be a novel prognostic marker for the survival of patients with CRC. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that ectopic expression of HES6 enhanced the migration and invasive abilities of CRC cells. These abilities were significantly inhibited upon knockdown of endogenous HES6 expression by specific short hairpin RNAs. Additionally, the present study reported that the effects of HES6 on metastasis may be associated with the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

We hypothesize that ITCs, as electrophiles, can interact with the catalytic triads (CYS, HIS, and ASP) of the proteasomal cysteine deubiquitinases USP14 and UCHL5, ultimately inhibiting their activities. In the current study, we exploited this possibility by performing both computational docking and biochemical validation assays using human breast and prostate cancer cell models. Docking results suggest that benzyl isothiocyanate, phenethyl isothiocyanate, and DL-sulforaphane are more potent inhibitors of UCHL5 than USP14, and these ITCs could interact with the catalytic triads of UCHL5 and USP14. Indeed, ubiquitin vinyl sulfone assay confirmed the inhibitory activity of each ITC on the ubiquitin-binding activity of UCHL5 and USP14. We also found that inhibition of USP-14 and UCHL5 activities by the ITCs caused increased levels of USP14 and UCHL5 proteins, but not the third 19S-deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), POH1/RPN11, suggesting feedback loop activation and further supporting that ITCs are inhibitors of proteasomal cysteine DUBs. Associated with DUB inhibition by ITCs, ubiquitinated proteins were significantly increased, accompanied with induction of apoptosis, inhibition of proliferation and suppression of cell invasion.

SCPC can evolve from prostate adenocarcinoma in response to androgen deprivation therapy, but, in rare cases, is present at initial cancer diagnosis. The molecular aetiology of de novo SCPC is incompletely understood, owing to the scarcity of tumour tissue and the short life-expectancy of patients. Through a retrospective search of our regional oncology pharmacy database, we identified 18 patients diagnosed with de novo SCPC between 2004 and 2017. Ten patients had pure SCPC pathology, and the remainder had some admixed adenocarcinoma foci, but all were treated with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The median overall survival was 28 months. We performed targeted DNA sequencing, whole exome sequencing and mRNA profiling on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tumour tissue. We observed frequent biallelic deletion and/or mutation of the tumour suppressor genes TP53, RB1, and PTEN, similarly to what was found in treatment-related SCPC. Indeed, at the RNA level, pure de novo SCPC closely resembled treatment-related SCPC. However, five patients had biallelic loss of DNA repair genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, and MSH2/6, potentially underlying the high genomic instability of this rare disease variant. Two patients with pure de novo SCPC harboured ETS gene rearrangements involving androgen-driven promoters, consistent with the evolution of de novo SCPC from an androgen-driven ancestor. Overall, our results reveal a highly aggressive molecular landscape that underlies this unusual pathological variant, and suggest opportunities for targeted therapy strategies in a disease with few treatment options.

With this in view, this paper presents results of a simulation of a 125I-seed treatment with an event-by-event MC code (LEPTS) specifically designed to account for the low energy secondary particle interactions, such as electron attachment, vibro-rotational and neutral dissociation interactions.

The removal of proteins by charcoal stripping may cause changes in biological functions and has not yet been investigated. Here we profiled proteins in FBS and CS-FBS using an ion-current-based quantitative platform consisting of reproducible surfactant-aided precipitation/on-pellet digestion, long-column nanoliquid chromatography separation, and ion-current-based analysis. A total of 143 proteins were identified in FBS, among which 14 proteins including insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) and IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-2 and -6 were reduced in CS-FBS.

Current methods for prostate cancer detection, like prostate-specific antigen screening, lead to significant overtreatment. The purpose of the study was to analyze circulating microRNAs in serum as non-invasive biomarkers in patients with diagnosis of prostate cancer and healthy individuals.  Methods:   This preliminary study included a population of 20 patients with mean age of 68.6 years and mean PSA of 21.3 ng/ml. Eight healthy patients were used as control. MiRNAs were quantified in the total RNA fraction extracted from serum and levels of five microRNAs (miR-106b, miR-141, miR-21, mir-34a, and miR-375) were quantified by RT-qPCR. Statistical analyses evaluated correlation between clinicopathological data and miRNAs expression levels.  Results:   Relative expression ratios of miR-106b, miR-141-3p, miR-21, and miR-375 were significantly increased (1.8-, 1.9-, 2.4-, and 2.6-fold, respectively) in the PCa group compared to healthy control. Using receiver operating characteristics, the highest area under the curve equal to 0.906 was obtained for miR-357 and indicates a very good diagnostic properties of this biomarker. We found expression level of mir-34a not related with PCa.  Conclusions:   Our results support previous findings on the possibility of discriminating prostate cancer patients from healthy controls by detecting miRNA (miR-141-3p, miR-21, and miR-375).

Methods:   Our data come from a larger study examining the efficacy of a decision aid on decisional conflict in men with prostate cancer who were deciding whether to participate in a prostate cancer clinical trial. We used latent growth mixture models to identify 'classes' (i.e. groups) of participants with different trajectories of anxiety, as assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state scale, and binary logistic regression to determine predictors of anxiety 'class'.  Results:   In 128 men with prostate cancer (mean age = 63), growth mixture modelling identified two classes defined by different anxiety trajectories. One class (n = 27) started with a higher mean anxiety score and did not change over time (stable high), whereas the second class (n = 101) started with lower anxiety and significantly reduced over time (low and recovering). None of the demographic and study variables (including age, education, marital status, and decision to join the trial) was predictive of anxiety class.  Conclusions:   Men treated for prostate cancer who have high levels of anxiety after surgery may continue to have persistent high anxiety levels which do not reduce naturally over time.

The Tec family nonreceptor tyrosine kinase BMX is activated downstream of PI3K and has been implicated in regulation of multiple pathways and in the development of cancers including prostate cancer. However, its precise mechanisms of action, and particularly its endogenous substrates, remain to be established. Here, we demonstrate that BMX expression in prostate cancer is suppressed directly by AR via binding to the BMX gene and that BMX expression is subsequently rapidly increased in response to ADT. BMX contributed to CRPC development in cell line and xenograft models by positively regulating the activities of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases through phosphorylation of a phosphotyrosine-tyrosine (pYY) motif in their activation loop, generating pYpY that is required for full kinase activity. To assess BMX activity in vivo, we generated a BMX substrate-specific antibody (anti-pYpY) and found that its reactivity correlated with BMX expression in clinical samples, supporting pYY as an in vivo substrate. Inhibition of BMX with ibrutinib (developed as an inhibitor of the related Tec kinase BTK) or another BMX inhibitor BMX-IN-1 markedly enhanced the response to castration in a prostate cancer xenograft model. These data indicate that increased BMX in response to ADT contributes to enhanced tyrosine kinase signaling and the subsequent emergence of CRPC, and that combination therapies targeting AR and BMX may be effective in a subset of patients.Significance: The tyrosine kinase BMX is negatively regulated by androgen and contributes to castration-resistant prostate cancer by enhancing the phosphorylation and activation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases following ADT.

We are interested in understanding the inhibitory mechanism of metformin on tumor-associated inflammation in prostate cancer.Experimental Design: By using a transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse model, in vitro macrophage migration assays, and patient samples, we examined the effect of metformin on tumor-associated inflammation during the initiation and after androgen deprivation therapy of prostate cancer.Results: Treating TRAMP mice with metformin delays prostate cancer progression from low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to high-grade PIN, undifferentiated to well-differentiated, and PIN to adenocarcinoma with concurrent inhibition of inflammatory infiltration evidenced by reduced recruitment of macrophages. Furthermore, metformin is capable of inhibiting the following processes: inflammatory infiltration after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) induced by surgically castration in mice, bicalutamide treatment in patients, and hormone deprivation in LNCaP cells. Mechanistically, metformin represses inflammatory infiltration by downregulating both COX2 and PGE2 in tumor cells.Conclusions: Metformin is capable of repressing prostate cancer progression by inhibiting infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages, especially those induced by ADT, by inhibiting the COX2/PGE2 axis, suggesting that a combination of ADT with metformin could be a more efficient therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer treatment.

We previously described an immune-inflammation signature in prostate tumors of African-American (AA) patients. Here, we further deconstructed this signature and investigated its relationships with tumor biology, survival, and a common germline variant in the IFNλ4 (IFNL4) gene.Experimental Design: We analyzed gene expression in prostate tissue datasets and performed genotype and survival analyses. We also overexpressed IFNL4 in human prostate cancer cells.Results: We found that a distinct interferon (IFN) signature that is analogous to the previously described ""IFN-related DNA damage resistance signature"" (IRDS) occurs in prostate tumors. Evaluation of two independent patient cohorts revealed that IRDS is detected about twice as often in prostate tumors of AA than European-American men. Furthermore, analysis in TCGA showed an association of increased IRDS in prostate tumors with decreased disease-free survival. To explain these observations, we assessed whether IRDS is associated with an IFNL4 germline variant (rs368234815-ΔG) that controls production of IFNλ4, a type III IFN, and is most common in individuals of African ancestry. We show that the IFNL4 rs368234815-ΔG allele was significantly associated with IRDS in prostate tumors and overall survival of AA patients. Moreover, IFNL4 overexpression induced IRDS in three human prostate cancer cell lines.Conclusions: Our study links a germline variant that controls production of IFNλ4 to the occurrence of a clinically relevant IFN signature in prostate tumors that may predominantly affect men of African ancestry.

These pathways can affect tumor growth, stabilization, or shrinkage via a number of signaling streams such as activation/inactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and caspases, generation of second messengers, and phospho-triggering of cyclin instability. Though prostate cancers are better known for their responsiveness to androgen deprivation, ∼17% of late stage tumors regress in response to high dose natural or pharmaceutical Es; however, the mechanisms at the cellular level are not understood. More accurate recent measurements show that estradiol (E2) levels decline in aging men, leading to the hypothesis that maintaining young male levels of E2 may prevent the growth of prostate cancers. Major contributions to reducing prostate cancer cell numbers included low E2 concentrations producing sustained ERK phospho-activation correlated with generation of reactive oxygen species causing cancer cell death, and phospho-activation of cyclin D1 triggering its rapid degradation by interrupting cell cycle progression. These therapeutic actions were stronger in early stage tumor cells (with higher membrane estrogen receptor levels), and E2 was far more effective compared to diethylstilbestrol (the most frequently prescribed E treatment). Xenoestrogens (XEs) exacerbated the growth of prostate cancer cells, and as we know from previous studies in pituitary cancer cells, can interfere with the nongenomic signaling actions of endogenous Es. Therefore, nongenomic actions of physiological levels of E2 may be important deterrents to the growth of prostate cancers, which could be undermined by the actions of XEs.""","""['Cheryl S Watson', 'Luke Koong', 'Yow-Jiun Jeng', 'Rene Vinas']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Steroids""","""['Direct estradiol and diethylstilbestrol actions on early- versus late-stage prostate cancer cells.', 'Combinations of physiologic estrogens with xenoestrogens alter ERK phosphorylation profiles in rat pituitary cells.', 'Rapid actions of xenoestrogens disrupt normal estrogenic signaling.', 'Nongenomic effects of estradiol vs. the birth control estrogen ethinyl estradiol on signaling and cell proliferation in pituitary tumor cells, and differences in the ability of R-equol to neutralize or enhance these effects.', 'Endocrine disruption via estrogen receptors that participate in nongenomic signaling pathways.', 'Exploring the Biological Activity and Mechanism of Xenoestrogens and Phytoestrogens in Cancers: Emerging Methods and Concepts.']"""

Results:   Consumption of certain groups of flavonoids significantly differed between controls and cases, in particular: flavonols (63.36 vs 37.14 mg/d, P < 0.001), flavanols (107.61 vs. 74.24 mg/d, P = .016), flavanones (40.92 vs. 81.32 mg/d, P < 0.001), catechins (63.36 vs. 36.18 mg/d, P = .006). In the multivariate model, flavanols and flavones were associated with reduced risk of PCa, despite not in the highest quartile of intake.

Materials and methods:   We developed a Markov decision analytical model to simulate the chain of events and downstream outcomes associated with ultrasound guided prostate biopsy and a strategy in which the biomarker panel is implemented prior to biopsy. The primary outcome was health outcomes, measured in QALYs (quality-adjusted life years). The secondary outcome was health care costs from the Medicare payer perspective. Multiple 1-way sensitivity analyses were performed to characterize model robustness.  Results:   The expected mean QALYs per patient under the current standard was 10.796 at a cost of $11,060 during an 18-year horizon. Incorporating the urinary biomarker panel resulted in an expected mean of 10.841 QALYs per patient and a mean cost of $9,366, representing an average of 0.045 QALYs gained at a cost savings of $1,694 per patient. When extrapolating these data to a conservative estimate of 311,879 men per year undergoing biopsy, one would expect that the biomarker panel would result in an incremental 14,035 QALYs gained at a cost savings of $528,323,026 in each yearly cohort. The biomarker panel strategy dominated the current standard across a wide range of sensitivity analyses.  Conclusions:   Routine use of the SelectMDx urinary biomarker panel to guide biopsy decision making improved health outcomes and lowered costs in American men at risk for prostate cancer. This strategy may optimize the value of prostate cancer risk assessment in an era of increasing financial accountability.""","""['Tim M Govers', 'Laura Caba', 'Matthew J Resnick']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Incorporating Biomarkers into the Primary Prostate Biopsy Setting: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.', 'Cost-effectiveness of a new urinary biomarker-based risk score compared to standard of care in prostate cancer diagnostics - a decision analytical model.', 'Cost-effectiveness of SelectMDx for prostate cancer in four European countries: a comparative modeling study.', 'A Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Surgery, Endothermal Ablation, Ultrasound-guided Foam Sclerotherapy and Compression Stockings for Symptomatic Varicose Veins.', 'The economics of active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness of an urinary biomarker panel in combination with MRI for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Biomarkers for prostate cancer detection and risk stratification.', 'Systematic Review of Cost-Effectiveness Models in Prostate Cancer: Exploring New Developments in Testing and Diagnosis.', 'Blood and urine biomarkers in prostate cancer: Are we ready for reflex testing in men with an elevated prostate-specific antigen?', ""Prostate Cancer Liquid Biopsy Biomarkers' Clinical Utility in Diagnosis and Prognosis.""]"""

However, veliparib only showed a moderate anticancer effect, and combination therapy is required for PCa patients. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been tested to improve the anticancer efficacy of PARP inhibitors for PCa cells, but the exact mechanisms are still elusive.  Methods:   Several types of PCa cells and prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 were treated with veliparib or SAHA alone or in combination. Cell viability or clonogenicity was tested with violet crystal assay; cell apoptosis was detected with Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry, and the cleaved PARP was tested with western blot; DNA damage was evaluated by staining the cells with γH2AX antibody, and the DNA damage foci were observed with a fluorescent microscopy, and the level of γH2AX was tested with western blot; the protein levels of UHRF1 and BRCA1 were measured with western blot or cell immunofluorescent staining, and the interaction of UHRF1 and BRCA1 proteins was detected with co-immunoprecipitation when cells were treated with drugs. The antitumor effect of combinational therapy was validated in DU145 xenograft models.  Results:   PCa cells showed different sensitivity to veliparib or SAHA. Co-administration of both drugs synergistically decreased cell viability and clonogenicity, and synergistically induced cell apoptosis and DNA damage, while had no detectable toxicity to normal prostate epithelial cells. Mechanistically, veliparib or SAHA alone reduced BRCA1 or UHRF1 protein levels, co-treatment with veliparib and SAHA synergistically reduced BRCA1 protein levels by targeting the UHRF1/BRCA1 protein complex, the depletion of UHRF1 resulted in the degradation of BRCA1 protein, while the elevation of UHRF1 impaired co-treatment-reduced BRCA1 protein levels. Co-administration of both drugs synergistically decreased the growth of xenografts.  Conclusions:   Our studies revealed that the synergistic lethality of HDAC and PARP inhibitors resulted from promoting DNA damage and inhibiting HR DNA damage repair pathways, in particular targeting the UHRF1/BRCA1 protein complex. The synergistic lethality of veliparib and SAHA shows great potential for future PCa clinical trials.""","""['Linglong Yin', 'Youhong Liu', 'Yuchong Peng', 'Yongbo Peng', 'Xiaohui Yu', 'Yingxue Gao', 'Bowen Yuan', 'Qianling Zhu', 'Tuoyu Cao', 'Leye He', 'Zhicheng Gong', 'Lunquan Sun', 'Xuegong Fan', 'Xiong Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Correction to: PARP inhibitor veliparib and HDAC inhibitor SAHA synergistically co-target the UHRF1/.

We aimed to investigate HRQOL change in PC patients who underwent three types of RP (open, laparoscopic, or robotic) and compared their HRQOL with that of general population.  Materials and methods:   Patients were prospectively recruited between October 2014 and December 2015.

Ratio-based models are attractive, as they require no additional normalization. Here, we train and independently validate a novel 4-miRNA prognostic ratio model for PC.  Patients and methods:   By genome-wide miRNA expression profiling of PC tissue samples from 123 men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) (PCA123, training cohort), we identified six top candidate prognostic miRNAs and systematically tested their ability to predict postoperative biochemical recurrence (BCR). The best miRNA-based prognostic ratio model (MiCaP) was validated in two independent cohorts (PCA352 and PCA476) including >800 RP patients in total. Clinical end points were BCR and prostate cancer-specific survival (CSS). The prognostic potential of MiCaP was assessed by univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier analyses.  Results:   We identified a 4-miRNA ratio model, MiCaP (miR-23a-3p×miR-10b-5p)/(miR-133a×miR-374b-5p), that predicted time to BCR independently of routine clinicopathologic variables in the training cohort (PCA123) and was successfully validated in two independent RP cohorts. In addition, MiCaP was a significant predictor of CSS in univariate analysis [HR 3.35 (95% CI 1.34 - 8.35), P = 0.0096] and in multivariate analysis [HR 2.43 (95% CI 1.45-4.07), P = 0.0210]. As proof-of-principle, we also analyzed MiCaP in plasma samples from 111 RP patients. A high MiCaP score in plasma was significantly associated with BCR (P = 0.0036, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Limitations include low mortality rates (CSS: 5.4%).

Membrane fusion, which is driven by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor associated receptor (SNARE) proteins, is an essential step of vesicle trafficking. Mammalian SNAREs represent a large group of proteins, but few have been implicated in the regulation of cell migration. Ykt6 is a unique SNARE existing in equilibrium between active membrane-bound and inactive cytoplasmic pools, and mediating vesicle trafficking between different intracellular compartments. The biological functions of this protein remain poorly understood. In the present study, we found that Ykt6 acts as a negative regulator of migration and invasion of human prostate epithelial cells. Furthermore, Ykt6 regulates the integrity of epithelial adherens and tight junctions. The observed anti-migratory activity of Ykt6 is mediated by a unique mechanism involving the expressional upregulation of microRNA 145, which selectively decreases the cellular level of Junctional Adhesion Molecule (JAM) A. This decreased JAM-A expression limits the activity of Rap1 and Rac1 small GTPases, thereby attenuating cell spreading and motility. The described novel functions of Ykt6 could be essential for the regulation of epithelial barriers, epithelial repair, and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells.""","""['Nayden G Naydenov', 'Supriya Joshi', 'Alex Feygin', 'Siddharth Saini', 'Larisa Litovchick', 'Andrei I Ivanov']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Phosphorylation of Ykt6 SNARE Domain Regulates Its Membrane Recruitment and Activity.', 'A conformational switch driven by phosphorylation regulates the activity of the evolutionarily conserved SNARE Ykt6.', 'Induction of cell scattering by expression of beta1 integrins in beta1-deficient epithelial cells requires activation of members of the rho family of GTPases and downregulation of cadherin and catenin function.', 'TRP Channel Trafficking.', 'Epithelial junctions and Rho family GTPases: the zonular signalosome.', 'A Proteomic Approach to Study the Biological Role of Hepatitis C Virus Protein Core+1/ARFP.', 'P-Cadherin Regulates Intestinal Epithelial Cell Migration and Mucosal Repair, but Is Dispensable for Colitis Associated Colon Cancer.', 'The Roles of Junctional Adhesion Molecules (JAMs) in Cell Migration.', 'YKT6, as a potential predictor of prognosis and immunotherapy response for oral squamous cell carcinoma, is related to cell invasion, metastasis, and CD8+ T cell infiltration.', 'Tumor Suppressor miR-584-5p Inhibits Migration and Invasion in Smoking Related Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells by Targeting YKT6.']"""

Published reports present a conflicting picture of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to study the clinical and pathological features of men undergoing prostate biopsy from different racial backgrounds in South Africa in an attempt to characterise the disease locally. Our hypothesis was that black African men presenting to our service had more severe disease characteristics than other patients.  Methods:   All patients who underwent a prostate biopsy at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town from July 2008 to July 2014 were studied. For each patient, data were collected on age, self-assigned race, presenting symptoms, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, prostate volume, and histological diagnosis.  Results:   A total of 1016 patients were studied. 162 (15.9%) were black and 854 (84.1%) were coloured (mixed ancestry), white, or Asian. Black patients were compared as a group to the coloured, white and Asian patients.

Methods:   The patient cohort included patients who underwent both CT and TRUS within a 3-month interval from January 2012 to December 2013 at a single institution. In all, 67 non-contrast and 217 contrast-enhanced CT images were reviewed twice by 3 independent observers 2 months after the initial evaluation. Prostate length and width were measured on axial images and height was measured on sagittal images. To compare differences between CT and TRUS in TPV estimation, the CT/TRUS ratio of TPV was calculated and a Bland-Altman plot was constructed. Inter- and intraobserver variabilities and the effect of contrast enhancement were also evaluated statistically.  Results:   The mean (± SD) age of patients was 64.5 ±10.8 years and the mean time interval between CT and TRUS was 16.3 ± 22.6 days. The mean TRUS-measured TPV was 44.7 ± 24.9 mL and the mean CT/TRUS TPV ratio was 0.80 ± 0.20, indicating that TPV estimated by CT is 20% lower than that determined by TRUS, regardless of contrast enhancement (P > .05). The mean difference in TPV between TRUS and CT was 11.3 ± 14.3 mL, with differences of 1.7, 9.9, and 32.9 mL for prostate volumes of ≤30, >30-60, and >60 mL, respectively.

In this paper, we explore new methodologies for comparing two continuous biomarkers that refer to a trichotomous disease status, when both markers are applied to the same patients. Comparisons based on the volume under the surface have been proposed before, but that measure is often not clinically relevant. Here, we focus on comparing two correlated ROC surfaces at given pairs of true classification rates, which are more relevant to patients and physicians. We propose delta-based parametric techniques, power transformations to normality, and bootstrap-based smooth nonparametric techniques to investigate the performance of an appropriate test.

Several epidemiological studies suggest a positive association between high plasma cholesterol levels and colorectal cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol may alter the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) are ill-defined as the cholesterol lowering drugs statins do not appear to decrease a patient's risk of developing colorectal cancer. Cholesterol is metabolized to active derivatives including cholesterol oxidization products (COP), known as oxysterols, which have been shown to alter cellular proliferation. These metabolites and not cholesterol per se, may therefore affect the risk of developing colorectal cancer. The cholesterol metabolite or the oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is the most abundant oxysterol in the plasma and has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of several cancers including breast and prostate cancer. However, the role of 27-OHC in colorectal cancer has not been investigated. We treated Caco2 and SW620, two well characterized colon cancer cells with low, physiological and high concentrations of 27-OHC, and found that 27-OHC reduces cellular proliferation in these cells. We also found that the effects of 27-OHC on cell proliferation are not due to cellular cytotoxicity or apoptotic cellular death. Additionally, 27-OHC-induced reduction in cell proliferation is independent of actions on its target nuclear receptors, liver-X-receptors (LXR) and estrogen receptors (ER) activation. Instead, our study demonstrates that 27-OHC significantly decreases AKT activation, a major protein kinase involved in the pathogenesis of cancer as it regulates cell cycle progression, protein synthesis, and cellular survival. Our data shows that treatment with 27-OHC substantially decreases the activation of AKT by reducing levels of its active form, p-AKT, in Caco2 cells but not SW620 cells. All-together, our results show for the first time that the cholesterol metabolite 27-OHC reduces cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells.""","""['Jessica Warns', 'Gurdeep Marwarha', 'Natalie Freking', 'Othman Ghribi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochimie""","""['The cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol regulates p53 activity and increases cell proliferation via MDM2 in breast cancer cells.', 'Differential effects of the estrogen receptor agonist estradiol on toxicity induced by enzymatically-derived or autoxidation-derived oxysterols in human ARPE-19 cells.', ""The oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol regulates α-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase expression levels in human neuroblastoma cells through modulation of liver X receptors and estrogen receptors--relevance to Parkinson's disease."", 'Pathophysiological role of 27-hydroxycholesterol in human diseases.', '27-hydroxycholesterol: A novel player in molecular carcinogenesis of breast and prostate cancer.', 'Identification of ABCA5 among ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter Family as a New Biomarker for Colorectal Cancer.', 'Cholesterol-Lowering Phytochemicals: Targeting the Mevalonate Pathway for Anticancer Interventions.', 'Interplay between Dysbiosis of Gut Microbiome, Lipid Metabolism, and Tumorigenesis: Can Gut Dysbiosis Stand as a Prognostic Marker in Cancer?', 'Revealing the Role of High-Density Lipoprotein in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, and Cancer Risk.']"""

PKM2 is up-regulated in multiple cancer types and is considered as a potential target for cancer therapy. HCA binds directly to PKM2 and selectively decreases the phosphorylation of PKM2 at Tyr105, indicating a potential anti-proliferative effect on prostate cancer cells. As a PKM2 activator, HCA increases pyruvate kinase activity by promoting the tetrameric state of PKM2. However, HCA suppresses protein kinase activity of PKM2 by decreasing the phosphorylation at Tyr105. Moreover, this leads to a decrease of PKM2-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 and a down-regulation of target genes, including MEK5 and cyclin D1.

Thus, targeting the AR N-terminal domain (NTD) could overcome such resistance.  Methods:   Luciferase reporter assays after transient transfection of various DNA constructs were used to assess effects of E1A proteins on AR-mediated transcription. Immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation were applied to assess intracellular protein localization. Immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assays were used to detect protein-protein interactions. qRT-PCR was employed to determine RNA levels. Western blotting was used to detect protein expression in cells. Effects of adenoviruses on prostate cancer cell survival were evaluated with CellTiter-Glo assays.  Results:   Adenovirus 12 E1A (E1A12) binds specifically to the AR. Interestingly, the full-length E1A12 (266 aa) preferentially binds to full-length AR, while the small E1A12 variant (235 aa) interacts more strongly with AR-V7. E1A12 promotes AR nuclear translocation, likely through mediating intramolecular AR NTD-LBD interactions. In the nucleus, AR and E1A12 co-expression in AR-null PCa cells results in E1A12 redistribution from nuclear foci containing CBX4 (also known as Pc2), suggesting a preferential AR-E1A12 interaction over other E1A12 interactors. E1A12 represses AR-mediated transcription in reporter gene assays and endogenous AR target genes such as ATAD2 and MYC in AR-expressing PCa cells. AR-expressing PCa cells are more sensitive to death induced by a recombinant adenovirus expressing E1A12 (Ad-E1A12) than AR-deficient PCa cells, which could be attributed to the increased viral replication promoted by androgen stimulation. Targeting the AR by E1A12 promotes apoptosis in PCa cells that express the full-length AR or C-terminally truncated AR variants. Importantly, inhibition of mTOR signaling that blocks the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins markedly augments Ad-E1A12-induced apoptosis of AR-expressing cells. Mechanistically, Ad-E1A12 infection triggers apoptotic response while activating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis; thus, mTOR inhibition enhances apoptosis in AR-expressing PCa cells infected by Ad-E1A12.

It was also found that C4-2B cells specifically shed large extracellular vesicles (LEVs) suggesting that these LEVs and their cargo could participate in the establishment of the osseous metastases. The level of expression of caveolin-1 increased as the system progresses from LNCaP to C4-2B. Since NQO2 RNA levels were not changed in LNCaP, C4, C4-2, and C4-2B, we tested an altered cellular distribution hypothesis of NQO2 being compartmentalized in the membrane fractions of C4-2B cells which are rich in lipid rafts and caveolae. This was confirmed when the detergent resistant membrane fractions were probed on immunoblots. Moreover, when the LEVs were analyzed for membrane associated caveolin-1 as possible cargo, we noticed that the enzyme NQO2 was also a component of the cargo along with caveolin-1 as seen in double immunofluorescence studies. Molecular modeling studies showed that a caveolin-1 accessible site is present in NQO2. Specific interaction between NQO2 and caveolin-1 was confirmed using deletion constructs of caveolin-1 fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Interestingly, whole cell lysate and mitochondrial preparations of LNCaP, C4, C4-2, and C4-2B showed an increasing expression of glutaminase (GLS, kidney type). The extrusion of LEVs appears to be a specific property of the bone metastatic C4-2B cells and this process could be inhibited by a GLS specific inhibitor BPTES, suggesting the critical role of a functioning glutamine metabolism. Our results indicate that a high level of expression of caveolin-1 in C4-2B cells contributes to an interaction between caveolin-1 and NQO2 and to their packaging as cargo in the shed LEVs.

The most recent sequencing approaches have allowed the identification of PTEN genomic alterations, including deletion, mutation, or rearrangement in about 50% of prostate cancer (PCa) cases. It appears that mechanisms leading to PTEN inactivation are cancer-specific, comprising gene mutations, small insertions/deletions, copy number alterations (CNAs), promoter hypermethylation, and RNA interference. The examination of publicly available results from deep-sequencing studies of various cancers showed that PCa appears to be the only cancer in which PTEN is lost mostly through CNA. Instead of inactivating mutations, which are seen in other cancers, deletion of the 10q23 locus is the most common form of PTEN inactivation in PCa. By investigating the minimal deleted region at 10q23, several other genes appear to be lost simultaneously with PTEN.

These analyses raise the possibility that 10q23 is lost upon selective pressure not only to inactivate PTEN but also to impair the expression of surrounding genes.

Tumors are potentially sensitive to PI3K pathway inhibitors, but reliable diagnostic tests that assess functional PI3K activity are lacking. Because PI3K pathway activity negatively regulates forkhead box-O (FOXO) transcription factor activity, FOXO target gene expression is inversely correlated with PI3K activity. A knowledge-based Bayesian computational model was developed to infer PI3K activity in cancer tissue samples from FOXO target gene mRNA levels and validated in cancer cell lines treated with PI3K inhibitors. However, applied to patient tissue samples, FOXO was often active in cancer types with expected active PI3K. SOD2 was differentially expressed between FOXO-active healthy and cancer tissue samples, indicating that cancer-associated cellular oxidative stress alternatively activated FOXO. To enable correct interpretation of active FOXO in cancer tissue, threshold levels for normal SOD2 expression in healthy tissue were defined above which FOXO activity is oxidative stress induced and below which PI3K regulated. In slow-growing luminal A breast cancer and low Gleason score prostate cancer, FOXO was active in a PI3K-regulated manner, indicating inactive PI3K. In aggressive luminal B, HER2, and basal breast cancer, FOXO was increasingly inactive or actively induced by oxidative stress, indicating PI3K activity.

CRPC is driven by aberrant activation of androgen receptor (AR) through mechanisms ranging from its amplification, mutation, post-translational modification, and expression of splice variants (e.g., AR-V7). Herein, we present experimental evidence for therapeutic vulnerability of CRPC to a novel phytochemical, leelamine (LLM), derived from pine tree bark. Exposure of human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP (an androgen-responsive cell line with mutant AR), C4-2B (an androgen-insensitive variant of LNCaP), and 22Rv1 (a CRPC cell line with expression of AR-Vs), and a murine prostate cancer cell line Myc-CaP to plasma achievable concentrations of LLM resulted in ligand-dependent (LNCaP) and ligand-independent (22Rv1) growth inhibition in vitro that was accompanied by downregulation of mRNA and/or protein levels of full-length AR as well as its splice variants, including AR-V7. LLM treatment resulted in apoptosis induction in the absence and presence of R1881. In silico modeling followed by luciferase reporter assay revealed a critical role for noncovalent interaction of LLM with Y739 in AR activity inhibition. Substitution of the amine group with an isothiocyanate functional moiety abolished AR and cell viability inhibition by LLM. Administration of LLM resulted in 22Rv1 xenograft growth suppression that was statistically insignificant but was associated with a significant decrease in Ki-67 expression, mitotic activity, expression of full-length AR and AR-V7 proteins, and secretion of PSA.

We computed age-standardised rates (world standard population) and applied joinpoint regression models to identify temporal trends and age period cohort (APC) models to disentangle the effects of age, period of death and cohort of birth on mortality.  Results:   In 2012, 2.4 million deaths were recorded in the EU (1.3 million from cancers and 1.1 million from CHD and CVD combined). Over the last decade, mortality from cancer fell by 14% in men and 8% in women, resulting in age-standardised rates of 144 and 88/100,000 persons, respectively, in 2012. The only exceptions to the general downward trends were pancreatic cancer and female lung cancer.

Methods:   Seven hundred eleven employed prostate cancer survivors treated with radical prostatectomy completed validated self-rating questionnaires at the beginning, the end, and 12 months post rehabilitation. Disease-related data was obtained from physicians and medical records. Work status and time until RTW were assessed at 12-months follow-up. Data were analyzed by univariate analyses (t-tests, chi-square-tests) and multivariate logistic regression models (OR with 95% CI).  Results:   The RTW rate at 12-months follow-up was 87% and the median time until RTW was 56 days. Univariate analyses revealed significant group differences in baseline personal characteristics and health status, psychosocial well-being and work-related factors between survivors who had vs. had not returned to work. Patients' perceptions of not being able to work (OR 3.671) and feeling incapable to return to the former job (OR 3.162) were the strongest predictors for not having returned to work at 12-months follow-up. Being diagnosed with UICC tumor stage III (OR 2.946) and patients' perceptions of not being able to work (OR 4.502) were the strongest predictors for late RTW (≥ 8 weeks).

To date, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), as a typical tumour marker, has been widely used in the early diagnosis of PCa. However, in practical clinical tests, high serum levels of PSA show a high probability for false-positive results, leading to misdiagnoses. In this study, we developed a new classification system for PCa, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and healthy subjects by using a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based immunoassay of multiple tumour markers along with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as immune probes and SiC@Ag@Ag-NPs SERS as immune substrates were constructed into a sandwich structure to serve as an ultrasensitive SERS-based immunoassay platform of tumour markers. With this assay, the limits of detection for PSA, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and human kallikrein 2 (hK2) were as low as 0.46 fg mL-1, 1.05 fg mL-1 and 0.67 fg mL-1, respectively. Furthermore, the serum levels of PSA, PSMA and hK2 in clinical samples were successfully detected using the SERS-based immunoassay platform, and correct classifications of PCa, BPH and healthy subjects were feasible with help of the linear SVM algorithm. These results demonstrate the potential for improving the diagnostic accuracy of PCa. Overall, the linear SVM classification model with multiple tumour markers exhibited good classifications of PCa, BPH and healthy subjects, with a PCa diagnostic accuracy of 70% that was significantly superior to that of the linear SVM classification model based only on the serum level of PSA (50%). Therefore, combining the SERS-based immunoassay with pattern recognition technology can allow for comprehensive analyses of the serum levels of multiple tumour markers to effectively improve the diagnostic accuracy of cancer with potential applications in point-of-care testing.""","""['Lu Zhou', 'Ye Liu', 'Fuyan Wang', 'Zhijian Jia', 'Jun Zhou', 'Tao Jiang', 'Lucia Petti', 'Yichen Chen', 'Qi Xiong', 'Xiaojun Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Talanta""","""['Vertical flow assays based on core-shell SERS nanotags for multiplex prostate cancer biomarker detection.', 'Clinical significance of expression of PSA, hK2, PSMA in the peripheral blood of patients with prostate cancer.', 'Discrimination of men with prostate cancer from those with benign disease by measurements of human glandular kallikrein 2 (HK2) in serum.', 'The role of molecular forms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA or hK3) and of human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2) in the diagnosis and monitoring of prostate cancer and in extra-prostatic disease.', 'PSA and hK2 in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'SERS Immunosensors for Cancer Markers Detection.', 'SERS-Based Biosensors Combined with Machine Learning for Medical Application.', 'Trends in Application of SERS Substrates beyond Ag and Au, and Their Role in Bioanalysis.', 'Towards Multiplexed and Multimodal Biosensor Platforms in Real-Time Monitoring of Metabolic Disorders.', 'The Impact of Lifestyle on Prostate Cancer: A Road to the Discovery of New Biomarkers.']"""

The mRNA levels of full length AR (AR-FL) and AR-Vs (AR-V1, AR-V4 and AR-V7) were measured using RT-qPCR. The protein expression of AR-FL (AR-CTD and AR-NTD) and AR-V7 were evaluated by the H-Score in immunohistochemistry (IHC). All investigated mRNA targets were expressed both in BPH and PCa. AR-FL mRNA levels were similar in both groups. AR-V4 mRNA expression showed higher levels in BPH, and AR-V1 and AR-V7 mRNA expression were higher in PCa. The AR-V7 protein showed a similar H-Score in both groups, while AR-CTD and AR-NTD were higher in nuclei of epithelial cells from BPH. These results support the assumption that these constitutively active isoforms of AR are involved in the pathophysiology of primary PCa and BPH.

Patients and Methods In period one, men with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer received open-label enzalutamide 160 mg daily. Men with no prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase at weeks 13 and 21 were treated until PSA progression (≥ 25% increase and ≥ 2 ng/mL above nadir), then randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio in period two to abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily with either enzalutamide or placebo (combination or control group, respectively) until disease progression as defined by the primary end point: progression-free survival (radiographic or unequivocal clinical progression or death during study). Secondary end points included time to PSA progression and PSA response in period two. Results Of 509 patients enrolled in period one, 251 were randomly assigned in period two. Median progression-free survival was 5.7 months in the combination group and 5.6 months in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.12; P = .22). There was no difference in the secondary end points. Grade 3 hypertension (10% v 2%) and increased ALT (6% v 2%) or AST (2% v 0%) were more frequent in the combination than the control group.

The formulated nanocomplex system exhibited sufficient stability against nuclease-induced degradation, leading to successful intracellular delivery for the desired therapeutic performance. Silencing of targeted genes and apoptosis induction were evaluated in vitro on human prostate LNCaP-LN3 cancer cells by using various biological analysis tools (e.g., real-time PCR, MTT cell viability test, and flow cytometry). It was demonstrated that when the total loaded siRNA amounts were kept the same in the nanocomplexes, the simultaneous silencing of triple genes with co-loaded siRNAs (i.e., Bcl-2, survivin, and AR-targeting siRNAs) enhanced BZT-induced apoptosis of cancer cells more efficiently than the silencing of each single gene alone, offering a novel way of improving the efficacy of gene therapeutics including anticancer drug.""","""['Eunshil Choi', 'Wonjae Yoo', 'Jae Hyung Park', 'Sehoon Kim']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Co-delivery of chemosensitizing siRNA and an anticancer agent via multiple monocomplexation-induced hydrophobic association.', 'Ultrasound-Guided Delivery of siRNA and a Chemotherapeutic Drug by Using Microbubble Complexes: In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluations in a Prostate Cancer Model.', 'Polymeric delivery of siRNA for dual silencing of Mcl-1 and P-glycoprotein and apoptosis induction in drug-resistant breast cancer cells.', 'The importance of co-delivery of nanoparticle-siRNA and anticancer agents in cancer therapy.', 'Elucidating the role of nutraceuticals in overexpressing antiapoptotic proteins in prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-specific degradable dextran for multiplexed immunotargeted siRNA therapeutics against prostate cancer.', 'Advances in Targeting Cancer-Associated Genes by Designed siRNA in Prostate Cancer.']"""

To determine why some tumours are radiosensitive, while others return after radiotherapy, requires new non-traditional approaches to oncology. Herein we used laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to test the hypothesis that Mn functions as a metabolic radioprotector and is an apex predictor of tumour radioresponsiveness. The genesis of this hypothesis lies in microbial and in vitro chemical systems. We measured the levels and spatial distributions of Mn in tissue sections of 7 specifically chosen tumour types with distinct clinically documented radioresponsiveness and patient outcomes, namely testis, lung, brain, skin, mesothelium, prostate and breast. Mn levels varied nearly 60-fold between individual tumours, from 0.02 μg g-1 to 1.15 μg g-1. The most radiosensitive cancer type, (testis), had the lowest Mn levels and the highest patient survival. Tumours at the radioresistant extreme (glioblastomas and melanomas) had the highest Mn levels and lowest patient survival. A direct association was found between total Mn contents and their variation, and clinically-inferred radioresponsiveness in each of these 7 tumour types, while no such association existed with Cu, Zn or Fe. The LA-ICP-MS data provided unique patient-specific 2D maps of the spatial metallomic heterogeneity of cancer cells and their stroma. These maps have fundamental and far reaching clinical implications. For the first time, Mn-based tumour data may allow for more precise radiodosages and improved treatment for the individual patient.""","""['Philip A Doble', 'George L Gabor Miklos']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Metallomics""","""['Regional distributions of manganese, iron, copper, and zinc in the brains of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced parkinsonian rats.', 'Alterations in manganese, copper, and zinc contents, and intracellular status of the metal-containing superoxide dismutase in human mesothelioma cells.', 'Anatomical region differences and age-related changes in copper, zinc, and manganese levels in the human brain.', 'Physiological functions of mineral micronutrients (Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Ni, Mo, B, Cl).', 'Bioimaging of metals by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS).', 'Facets of ICP-MS and their potential in the medical sciences-Part 1: fundamentals, stand-alone and hyphenated techniques.', 'Non-invasive radionuclide imaging of trace metal trafficking in health and disease: ""PET metallomics"".', 'The Role of the Metabolism of Zinc and Manganese Ions in Human Cancerogenesis.', 'Small-Molecule Mn Antioxidants in Caenorhabditis elegans and Deinococcus radiodurans Supplant MnSOD Enzymes during Aging and Irradiation.', 'An integrated mass spectrometry imaging and digital pathology workflow for objective detection of colorectal tumours by unique atomic signatures.']"""

BCR-free survival was compared using the log-rank test and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis. During median follow-up of 48 months (range: 1-78 months), 31 (8.05%) patients experienced BCR.

Results of a Multicentric Study""","""Introduction:   In Western countries about 25% of prostate cancer (PCa) are high-risk tumors at presentation and its treatment is still a matter of debate among urologists. When a surgical approach is preferred the use of a mininvasive tecnique is still difficult due to the lack of data supporting it in literature. The aim of this study is to evaluate feasibility and safety of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) for high-risk PCa.  Materials and methods:   The study included 1114 patients with high-risk PCa submitted to LRP between 1998 and 2014. High-risk patients were defined according to D'Amico classification. We collected functional and oncological long-term outcomes and evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses the role of predictive factors for survival and biochemical recurrence (BR).  Results:   Mean age at treatment was 62 ± 8 years; mean follow-up was 74 ± 50 months. We obtained an overall survival (OS) of 96.6% at a mean follow-up of 74 months (1076 patients) and a disease-free survival of 66.2% (737 patients). Age (p = 0.0006), pT (p < 0.0001), pN (p = 0.0018), and surgical margins (p = 0.0076) resulted as independent predictors for BR in multivariate analysis. pN (p = 0.0025) and Gs (p = 0.0003) are independent predictors for OS and cancer-specific survival in a univariate analysis; just the Gs results significant in the multivariate model.  Conclusions:   According to our encouraging data about oncological and functional outcomes we believe that radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment for patients with high-risk PCa and that laparoscopy is a safe approach offering a mini-invasive alternative to open surgery.""","""['Virginia Varca', 'Andrea Benelli', 'Davide Perri', 'Ali Sedar Gozen', 'Marcel Fiedler', 'Alexandre de la Taille', 'Giovanni Casazza', 'Laurent Salomon', 'Jens Rassweiler', 'Andrea Gregori', 'Franco Gaboardi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Long-term oncological and continence outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single-centre experience.', 'Intermediate-term cancer control outcomes in prostate cancer patients treated with robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a multi-institutional analysis.', 'Long-Term Oncologic Outcome of an Initial Series of Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer After a Median Follow-up of 10 Years.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a review.', 'Ki67 and the apparent diffusion coefficient in postoperative prostate cancer with endocrine therapy.', 'A novel ""three-port"" trocar placement technique for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.']"""

Here, we report the role of MTA1 in prostate cancer progression and bone metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We found that MTA1 silencing diminished formation of bone metastases and impaired tumor growth in intracardiac and subcutaneous prostate cancer xenografts, respectively. This was attributed to reduced colony formation, invasion, and migration capabilities of MTA1 knockdown cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that MTA1 silencing led to a significant decrease in the expression of cathepsin B (CTSB), a cysteine protease critical for bone metastasis, with an expected increase in the levels of E-cadherin in both cells and xenograft tumors. Moreover, meta-analysis of clinical samples indicated a positive correlation between MTA1 and CTSB. Together, these results demonstrate the critical role of MTA1 as an upstream regulator of CTSB-mediated events associated with cell invasiveness and raise the possibility that targeting MTA1/CTSB signaling in the tumor may prevent the development of bone metastasis in prostate cancer.""","""['Avinash Kumar', 'Swati Dhar', 'Gisella Campanelli', 'Nasir A Butt', 'Jason M Schallheim', 'Christian R Gomez', 'Anait S Levenson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['MTA1-activated Epi-microRNA-22 regulates E-cadherin and prostate cancer invasiveness.', 'Akt mediates metastasis-associated gene 1 (MTA1) regulating the expression of E-cadherin and promoting the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells.', 'MTA family of proteins in prostate cancer: biology, significance, and therapeutic opportunities.', 'MTA1 promotes the invasion and migration of oral squamous carcinoma by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the hedgehog signaling pathway.', 'MTA1: A Vital Modulator in Prostate Cancer.', 'Gnetin C Intercepts MTA1-Associated Neoplastic Progression in Prostate Cancer.', 'A circadian rhythm-related gene signature for predicting relapse risk and immunotherapeutic effect in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'RUNX2 recruits the NuRD(MTA1)/CRL4B complex to promote breast cancer progression and bone metastasis.', 'Dietary Pterostilbene for MTA1-Targeted Interception in High-Risk Premalignant Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Noncoding RNAs in the Regulation of Anoikis and Anchorage-Independent Growth in Cancer.']"""

Moreover, a rapid change in PSA kinetics, either before or after treatment, is an indicator of poor prognosis after radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of total PSA at the time of Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT (trigger PSA), PSA velocity (PSAvel), and PSA doubling time (PSAdt) on the Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT detection rate in prostate cancer patients who showed biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy during follow-up.  Methods:   In total, 208 patients who showed an increase in PSA were evaluable for this retrospective analysis covering November 2015 to March 2017. Data were available for calculation of PSAvel in 112 patients and for PSAdt in 157 patients. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether there was a relationship between the PSA levels and PSA kinetics and the rate of detection of relapse using Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT.  Results:   Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT detected disease relapse in 151 of 208 patients (72.6%). The PSA level (P < 0.0001) and PSAdt (P = 0.0036) were significantly different between SPECT-positive patients (higher PSA level, shorter PSAdt) and SPECT-negative patients (lower PSA, longer PSAdt). ROC analysis showed that a PSA level of 1.30 ng/mL and a PSAdt of 2.9 months were optimal cut-off values. Patients with purely local recurrence had lower PSAvel and longer PSAdt values (P < 0.001). According to the multivariate analysis, a pathological positive SPECT/CT scan was associated with the PSA level (P < 0.001), PSAdt <6 months (P < 0.05), and Gleason scores (GSC) >7 (P < 0.05).  Conclusion:   The Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT detection rate is influenced by trigger PSA, PSAdt, and PSAvel. Like PSA, PSAdt is an independent predictor of Tc-99m HYNIC PSMA SPECT/CT.

Despite the importance of AR expression regulation, the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. ARID5B, an AT-rich interaction domain DNA-binding motif-containing transcription factor, is expressed higher in primary PCa than normal prostate, and correlated with AR expression. We therefore hypothesized that ARID5B could regulate AR expression.  Methods:   Correlation between AR and ARID5B expression was analyzed using publicly and commercially available microarray data. To examine the role of ARID5B in AR expression, ARID5B was knocked down in VCaP and LNCaP cells, then mRNA and protein levels of AR were measured and an in vitro cell proliferation assay was performed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to further examine molecular mechanisms.  Results:   Knockdown of ARID5B suppressed the AR mRNA and protein expression in VCaP and LNCaP cells and decreased in vitro cell proliferation. Suppression of ARID5B decreased the occupancy of active RNA polymerase II in the AR promoter, indicating that ARID5B regulates AR transcription. The active histone mark, H3K4me3, occupancy was decreased with ARID5B knockdown.

Methods:   A previously developed theoretical evolutionary dynamics model of stochastic branching processes is applied to compute the probability of tumor eradication with two targeted drugs. Publicly available data sets were surveyed to parameterize the model.  Results:   Our calculations reveal that the greatest influence on successful treatment is the genetic background including the number of mutations overcoming resistance. Another important criteria is the tumor size at which it is still possible to achieve tumor eradication, for example, 2-4 cm large tumors have at best a 10% probability to be eradicated when 50 mutations can confer resistance to each drug.

Other significant differences includes EP-RRP vs. TPRRP, ventilatory pressures (cm of H2O) [34 (32-34) vs. 40 (38-40) (p = 0.000)], ETCO2 (mm of Hg) [38 (36-40) vs. 32 (30-34) (p = 0.000)], ambulation (day) [0.00 (0-1) vs. 0.00 (0-2) (p = 0.022)], return of bowel activity (day) [1.0 (1.0-2.0) vs. 2.0 (2.0-2.0) (p = 0.000)] and opening of bowel (day) [2.0 (1.0-2.0) vs. 3.0 (3.0-3.0) (p = 0.000)]. EP-RRP offers similar clinical outcomes to TPRRP but with the advantages of shorter Trendelenburgh time, early recovery of bowel functions with avoidance of bowel injury and intraperitoneal urine leak.

AR-Vs have been the focus of many studies. Expression of AR-Vs has been proposed as a biomarker for resistance to androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic disease. Herein, we show dynamic changes in AR-Vs expression in response to androgen modulation.  Methods:   The C4-2B cell line was exposed to low (10-13 M) and high (10-8 M) androgen (dihydrotestosterone, DHT) levels, with or without flutamide. mRNA and protein expression levels were assessed by qPCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively.  Results:   We demonstrated that high levels of DHT downregulate AR-FL and AR-Vs. Even though AR-Vs did not present ligand-binding domain, thus were not capable of binding to DHT, they present dynamic changes under androgen treatment. Treatment with flutamide alone or in association with low levels of DHT stimulates growth of prostatic cells.  Conclusions:   Importantly, we provide evidence that AR-Vs respond differently to androgenic modulation. These findings have implications for a better understanding of the role of AR-Vs in prostate carcinogenesis.""","""['Ana Caroline Hillebrand', 'Lolita Schneider Pizzolato', 'Gisele Branchini', 'Ilma Simoni Brum']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Endocrine""","""['Prostate cancer characteristics associated with response to pre-receptor targeting of the androgen axis.', 'Attenuation of androgenic regulation by brefeldin A in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of novel androgen receptor target genes in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Regulation of androgen receptor levels: implications for prostate cancer progression and therapy.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the recently introduced 18F-PSMA-1007 in patients with recurrent PCa.  Methods:   This retrospective analysis included 100 consecutive patients with biochemical relapse (mean age 68.75 ± 7.6 years) referred for PSMA PET/CT. Whole-body PET/CT imaging (from the lower limbs to the skull) was performed in all patients 120 min after injection of 338 ± 44.31 MBq 18F-PSMA-1007. Prostatectomy, radiation beam therapy of the prostate bed and androgen-deprivation therapy had been performed in 92%, 45% and 27% of the patients, respectively. Radiation beam therapy of the prostate bed had been performed in addition to surgery in 38 patients (38%) and 10 patients (10%) had received all three therapy modalities. The probability of a 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT scan suggestive of pathology was compared with the Gleason score (GS) and PSA level.  Results:   Of the 100 patients, 95 (95%) showed at least one pathological finding on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT. The overall median PSA level was 1.34 ng/ml (range 0,04-41.3 ng/ml). The rates of pathological scans were 86%, 89%, 100% and 100% among patients with PSA levels ≤0.5, 0.51-1.0, 1.1-2.0 and > 2.0 ng/ml, respectively. The median GS was 7 (range 5-10). The majority of patients (70) with a GS available had a score in the range 7-9. The rate of pathological scans in these patients was 93% (65/70). The median SUVmax values of the pathological findings were 10.25, 14.32, 13.16 and 28.87 in patients with PSA levels ≤0.5, 0.51-1.0, 1.1-2.0 and >2.0 ng/ml, respectively. The median SUVmax in patients with a PSA level of >2.0 ng/ml was significantly higher than in all other PSA groups.  Conclusion: 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT can detect recurrent PCa in a high percentage of patients with biochemical relapse. The probability of a pathological 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT scan seems to be high even in patients with a low PSA level ≤0.5 ng/ml, and this may have a significant impact on the management of this relevant group of patients.""","""['Kambiz Rahbar', 'Ali Afshar-Oromieh', 'Robert Seifert', 'Stefan Wagner', 'Michael Schäfers', 'Martin Bögemann', 'Matthias Weckesser']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Detection Efficacy of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in 251 Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Diagnostic performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in biochemically relapsed patients with prostate cancer with PSA levels\u2009≤\u20092.0\u2009ng/ml.', 'The Diagnostic Performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Early Recurrence after Definitive Therapy with a PSA <10 ng/ml.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'PSMA PET imaging in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.', 'Early biochemical and radiographic response after one cycle of 177LuLu-PSMA I&T radioligand therapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a Companion Diagnostic Radiopharmaceutical, 18FPSMA-1007, in a Subcutaneous Prostate Cancer Xenograft Mouse Model.', 'Recurrent Prostate Cancer Diagnostics with 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT: A Systematic Review of the Current State.', 'Time after Synthesis and Time after Injection Do Not Affect Diagnostic Quality of 18FF-PSMA 1007 PET.']"""

Objectives:   To compare overall survival between patients with cancer receiving CCT with or without CM and to compare adherence to treatment and characteristics of patients receiving CCT with or without CM.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective observational study used data from the National Cancer Database on 1 901 815 patients from 1500 Commission on Cancer-accredited centers across the United States who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2013. Patients were matched on age, clinical group stage, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, insurance type, race/ethnicity, year of diagnosis, and cancer type. Statistical analysis was conducted from November 8, 2017, to April 9, 2018.  Exposures:   Use of CM was defined as ""Other-Unproven: Cancer treatments administered by nonmedical personnel"" in addition to at least 1 CCT modality, defined as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormone therapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   Overall survival, adherence to treatment, and patient characteristics.  Results:   The entire cohort comprised 1 901 815 patients with cancer (258 patients in the CM group and 1 901 557 patients in the control group). In the main analyses following matching, 258 patients (199 women and 59 men; mean age, 56 years [interquartile range, 48-64 years]) were in the CM group, and 1032 patients (798 women and 234 men; mean age, 56 years [interquartile range, 48-64 years]) were in the control group. Patients who chose CM did not have a longer delay to initiation of CCT but had higher refusal rates of surgery (7.0% [18 of 258] vs 0.1% [1 of 1031]; P < .001), chemotherapy (34.1% [88 of 258] vs 3.2% [33 of 1032]; P < .001), radiotherapy (53.0% [106 of 200] vs 2.3% [16 of 711]; P < .001), and hormone therapy (33.7% [87 of 258] vs 2.8% [29 of 1032]; P < .001). Use of CM was associated with poorer 5-year overall survival compared with no CM (82.2% [95% CI, 76.0%-87.0%] vs 86.6% [95% CI, 84.0%-88.9%]; P = .001) and was independently associated with greater risk of death (hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.50-2.90) in a multivariate model that did not include treatment delay or refusal. However, there was no significant association between CM and survival once treatment delay or refusal was included in the model (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.83-2.33).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, patients who received CM were more likely to refuse additional CCT, and had a higher risk of death.

Methods:   Four miRNA and three gene expression microarray datasets were downloaded for analysis from Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed miRNA and genes were accessed by a GEO2R. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID program. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks were constructed using the STRING and Cytoscape tool. Moreover, the results and clinical significance were validated in TCGA data.  Results:   We identified 26 significant DEMs, 633 upregulated DEGs, and 261 downregulated DEGs. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that significant DEGs were related to TGF-beta signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway in PCa. Key DEGs such as HSPA8, PPP2R1A, CTNNB1, ADCY5, ANXA1, and COL9A2 were found as hub genes in PPI networks. TCGA data supported our results and the miRNAs were correlated with clinical stages and overall survival.  Conclusions:   We identified 26 miRNAs that may take part in key pathways like TGF-beta and TNF pathways in prostate cancer regulatory networks. MicroRNAs like miR-23b, miR-95, miR-143, and miR-183 can be utilized in assisting the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer as biomarkers.

To this end, a ""three-in-one"" nanohybrid of MOF@AuNP@GO is designed as synergistic nanoquencher to develop a novel fluorescence biosensor for rapid and sensitive detection of cancer-related biomarkers. Methods: The ssDNA absorption affinities and fluorescence quenching abilities of the MOF@AuNP@GO were evaluated using FAM-labeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Then, two specific dye-labeled ssDNA and aptamer probes were designed for the recognition of p53 gene and prostate specific antigen (PSA), respectively. Fluorescence spectra were recorded and ratiometric signal processing was performed. Results: The designed nanohybrids exhibit enhanced ssDNA binding affinities and fluorescence quenching abilities, which significantly decrease the background signal and increase the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, thus lowering the detection limit (LOD). Accordingly, with ratiometric measurement, this developed nanosensor can sensitively measure p53 gene and PSA with LODs of 0.005 nM and 0.01 ng mL-1, respectively. Besides, this method also displays excellent performances with respect to universality, multiplexed detection, specificity, and practicality in human serum.

Special analyses on liver cancer mortality, given the higher prevalence of hepatitis C infection among the 1945-1965 birth cohort, were performed.Results: A total of 244,238 cancer-related deaths were analyzed. Mortality rates were highest for U.S.-born blacks and lowest for South Americans and Asians. Minority groups had higher mortality from liver and stomach cancer than NHWs; Hispanics and NHBs also had higher mortality from cervical and prostate cancers. Excess liver cancer mortality among Puerto Rican and U.S.-born black men was observed, particularly for the 1945-1965 birth cohort, with mortality rate ratios of 4.27 (95% CI, 3.82-4.78) and 3.81 (95% CI, 3.45-4.20), respectively.Conclusions: U.S.-born blacks and Puerto Ricans, who share a common disadvantaged socioeconomic profile, bear a disproportionate burden for many cancers, including liver cancer among baby boomers.

In vitro studies demonstrated successful masking of copper binding as well as clean liberation of the chelator by GGT.

In the case of LNCaP cells, upregulated miR-449a directly downregulates c-Myc that is required to induce the cell cycle regulators Cdc25A and Cdc2/CyclinB whose inactivation blocks G2 to M phase transition. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are yet unclear, although in other prostate cancer cells the interactions among p53, miR-449a and Sirt-1 can affect the induction of the G2/M arrest. In order to clarify these molecular mechanisms, in this work we propose a boolean model of the G2/M checkpoint arrest regulation contemplating the influence of miR-449a. The model shows that the cell fate determination between two cellular phenotypes: G2/M-Arrest for DNA repair and G2/M-induced apoptosis is stochastic and influenced by miR-449a state of activation. The results were compared with experimental data available presenting agreement. We also found that several feedback loops are involved in this cell fate regulation and we indicate, through in silico gain or loss of function perturbations of genes, which of these feedback loops are more efficient to favor a specific phenotype.""","""['Shantanu Gupta', 'Daner A Silveira', 'José Carlos M Mombach']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['miR-449a enhances radiosensitivity through modulating pRb/E2F1 in prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-449a enhances radiosensitivity by downregulation of c-Myc in prostate cancer cells.', 'miR-449a causes Rb-dependent cell cycle arrest and senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'Cell cycle regulation after exposure to ionizing radiation.', 'MicroRNA-449 in cell fate determination.', 'Quadra-Stable Dynamics of p53 and PTEN in the DNA Damage Response.', 'Network analysis reveals that the tumor suppressor lncRNA GAS5 acts as a double-edged sword in response to DNA damage in gastric cancer.', 'Study on the role of SLC14A1 gene in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'A Boolean Model of the Proliferative Role of the lncRNA XIST in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Dynamical Analysis of a Boolean Network Model of the Oncogene Role of lncRNA ANRIL and lncRNA UFC1 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

Two studies were conducted, one that involved a nationally representative U.S. sample and another that involved an online convenience sample. All participants were asked whether they would want to receive a hypothetical screening test for breast (women) or prostate (men) cancer that does not reduce the chance of cancer death or extend the length of life. Over half of participants wanted to receive the described screening test. Many people did not believe that cancer screening might not save lives, yet screening preferences were not due to disbelief alone. Results further suggested that cancer worry, reassurance, and a desire for health information explained variance in preferences for unbeneficial screening, adjusting for beliefs about screening benefits, perceptions of screening risks, family history, perceptions of cancer risk, and demographics.

We extracted 696 differentially expressed genes relative to a reported PC signature from the TCGA dataset (n = 492) and built a 15-gene signature (SigMuc1NW) using Elastic-net with 10-fold cross-validation through analyzing their expressions at 1.5 standard deviation/SD below and 2 SD above a population mean. SigMuc1NW predicts biochemical recurrence (BCR) following surgery with 56.4% sensitivity, 72.6% specificity, and 63.24 median months disease free (MMDF) (P = 1.12e-12). The prediction accuracy is improved with the use of SigMuc1NW's cutpoint (P = 3e-15) and is further enhanced (sensitivity 67%, specificity 75.7%, MMDF 45.2, P = 0) when all 15 genes were analyzed through their cutpoints instead of their SDs. These genes individually associate with BCR using either SD or cutpoint as the cutoff points. Eight of 15 genes are individual risk factors after adjusting for age at diagnosis, Gleason score, surgical margin, and tumor stage. Eleven of 15 genes are novel to PC. SigMuc1NW discriminates BCR with time-dependent AUC (tAUC) values of 76.6% at 11.5 months (76.6%-11.5 m), 73.8%-22.3 m, 78.5%-32.1 m, and 76.4%-48.4 m. SigMuc1NW is correlated with adverse features of PC, high Gleason scores (odds ratio/OR 1.48, P < 2e-16), and advanced tumor stages (OR 1.33, P = 4.37e-13). SigMuc1NW remains an independent risk factor of BCR (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.53-3.87, P = 1.62e-4) after adjusting for age at diagnosis, Gleason score, surgical margin, and tumor stage. In an independent PC (MSKCC) cohort (n = 140), these 15 genes were altered in PC vs normal tissue, metastatic PCs vs primary PCs, and recurrent PCs vs nonrecurrent PCs. Importantly, a 10-gene subsignature SigMuc1NW1 predicts BCR in MSKCC (P = 3.11e-15) and TCGA (P = 3.13e-12); SigMuc1NW1 discriminates BCR at 18.4 m with tAUC as 82.5%.

Methods:   Diffusion-weighted stimulated-echo images with various combinations of mixing time (TM), TE, and b-value were acquired to enable simultaneous mapping of T1 , T2 , and ADC. The proposed STEM method was performed by densely sampling the TM-TE-b space in a phantom and in brain and prostate of healthy volunteers. T1 , T2 , and ADC from STEM were compared to reference mapping methods. Additionally, protocol optimization was performed to enable rapid STEM acquisition within 2 min by sparsely sampling the TM-TE-b space. The T1 , T2 , and ADC measurements from rapid acquisitions were compared to the densely sampled STEM for evaluation. Finally, a patient with biopsy-proven high-risk prostate cancer was imaged to demonstrate the ability of STEM to differentiate cancer and healthy tissues.  Results:   Relative to the reference measurements, densely sampled STEM provided accurate quantitative T1 , T2 , and ADC mapping in phantoms (R2 = 0.999, slope between 0.97-1.03), as well as in brain and prostate.

On the other hand, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), a metabolic enzyme, has been proven to be a highly expressed biomarker in prostate cancer cells. Therefore, a method or tool, which can detect either PSA or AMACR or both simply, cost effectively, and with high sensitivity and selectivity is desirable. We describe a novel bioconjugated, single-use biosensor capable of detecting both PSA and AMACR antigens in undiluted human serum. The preparation of the biosensor by the bioconjugation mechanism occurred within a day, which could be completed prior to actual testing. The effectiveness of the bioconjugation mechanism and the coverage of the electrode surface of the biosensor were experimentally assessed. Measurements of PSA and AMACR antigens and the specificity of the biosensor were carried out using differential pulse voltammetry.

Notably, Shieldin inactivation further sensitizes BRCA1-deficient cells to cisplatin, suggesting how defining the SHLD1/2 status of BRCA1-deficient tumours might aid patient stratification and yield new treatment opportunities.

Testosterone levels correlated with androstenedione (AD) and DHT, while DHT, AD, androsterone (AST), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and androstenediol (A5diol) were highly correlated to each other and negatively associated with age. Higher tertiles of estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) were significantly associated with sooner time to CRPC. In patients with longitudinal samples, increases in serum DHEA and AST were significantly associated with sooner time to CRPC. Limitations include the number of events for some groups.Conclusions: Our data suggest the patient hormonal milieu has long-term prognostic value in men receiving ADT for recurrent prostate cancer, including increased levels of E1 and E2 and rising DHEA and AST levels, which predict a shorter time to CRPC.

This study aimed to identify combination therapies that exploit clinical BH3 mimetics for prostate cancer.Experimental Design: Prostate cancer cells or xenografts were treated with BH3 mimetics as single agents or in combination with other agents, and effects on MCL1 and apoptosis were assessed. MCL1 was also targeted directly using RNAi, CRISPR, or an MCL1-specific BH3 mimetic, S63845.Results: We initially found that MCL1 depletion or inhibition markedly sensitized prostate cancer cells to apoptosis mediated by navitoclax, but not venetoclax, in vitro and in vivo, indicating that they are primed to undergo apoptosis and protected by MCL1 and BCLXL. Small-molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors (erlotinib, lapatinib) also dramatically sensitized to navitoclax-mediated apoptosis, and this was associated with markedly increased proteasome-dependent degradation of MCL1. This increased MCL1 degradation appeared to be through a novel mechanism, as it was not dependent upon GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitylation by the ubiquitin ligases βTRCP and FBW7, or through other previously identified MCL1 ubiquitin ligases or deubiquitinases. Inhibitors targeting additional kinases (cabozantinib and sorafenib) similarly caused GSK3β-independent MCL1 degradation, and in combination with navitoclax drove apoptosis in vitro and in vivo Conclusions: These results show that prostate cancer cells are primed to undergo apoptosis and that cotargeting BCLXL and MCL1, directly or indirectly through agents that increase MCL1 degradation, can induce dramatic apoptotic responses.

MAO-A also has been reported as a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling cytokine-induced MAO-A expression in immune or cancer cells remain to be identified. Here, we show that MAO-A expression is co-induced with 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) in interleukin 13 (IL-13)-activated primary human monocytes and A549 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells. We present evidence that MAO-A gene expression and activity are regulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 1, 3, and 6 (STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6), early growth response 1 (EGR1), and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), the same transcription factors that control IL-13-dependent 15-LO expression. We further established that in both primary monocytes and in A549 cells, IL-13-stimulated MAO-A expression, activity, and function are directly governed by 15-LO. In contrast, IL-13-driven expression and activity of MAO-A was 15-LO-independent in U937 promonocytic cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the 15-LO-dependent transcriptional regulation of MAO-A in response to IL-13 stimulation in monocytes and in A549 cells is mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and that signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) plays a crucial role in facilitating the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. We further report that the IL-13-STAT6-15-LO-PPARγ axis is critical for MAO-A expression, activity, and function, including migration and reactive oxygen species generation. Altogether, these results have major implications for the resolution of inflammation and indicate that MAO-A may promote metastatic potential in lung cancer cells.""","""['Sukhamoy Dhabal', 'Pradip Das', 'Pritam Biswas', 'Priyanka Kumari', 'Valentin P Yakubenko', 'Suman Kundu', 'Martha K Cathcart', 'Manjari Kundu', 'Kaushik Biswas', 'Ashish Bhattacharjee']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['IL-4 and IL-13 employ discrete signaling pathways for target gene expression in alternatively activated monocytes/macrophages.', 'IL-13 and the hydroperoxy fatty acid 13(S)HpODE play crucial role in inducing an apoptotic pathway in cancer cells involving MAO-A/ROS/p53/p21 signaling axis.', 'Th2 response of human peripheral monocytes involves isoform-specific induction of monoamine oxidase-A.', 'Inhibition of IL-4-inducible gene expression in human monocytes by type I and type II interferons.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.', 'Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Prevent Glucose-Dependent Energy Production, Proliferation and Migration of Bladder Carcinoma Cells.', 'Ultrasound Neuromodulation of the Spleen Has Time-Dependent Anti-Inflammatory Effect in a Pneumonia Model.', 'Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Novel MAO-A Inhibitors Targeting Lung Cancer.', 'Repurposing monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis possibly through modulating reactive oxidative stress mediated inflammatory cytokines.', '15-Lipoxygenase and its metabolites in the pathogenesis of breast cancer: A double-edged sword.']"""

Downexpression of miR-133a-3p has been found to contribute to the progression, recurrence and distant metastasis in PCa. However, clinical significance of miR-133a-3p in bone metastasis of PCa, and the biological role of miR-133a-3p and its molecular mechanisms underlying bone metastasis of PCa remain unclear.  Methods:   miR-133a-3p expression was evaluated in 245 clinical PCa tissues by real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the clinical correlation between miR-133a-3p expression and clinicopathological features, and overall and bone metastasis-free survival in PCa patients. The biological roles of miR-133a-3p in the bone metastasis of PCa were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis, real-time PCR, western blot and luciferase reporter analysis were applied to demonstrate the relationship between miR-133a-3p and its potential targets. Western blotting and luciferase assays were examined to identify the underlying pathway involved in the anti-tumor role of miR-133a-3p. Clinical correlation of miR-133a-3p with its targets was verified in human PCa tissues.  Results:   miR-133a-3p expression is reduced in PCa tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues and benign prostate lesion tissues, particularly in bone metastatic PCa tissues. Low expression of miR-133a-3p is significantly correlated with advanced clinicopathological characteristics and shorter bone metastasis-free survival in PCa patients by statistical analysis. Moreover, upregulating miR-133a-3p inhibits cancer stem cell-like phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, as well as attenuates anoikis resistance in vitro in PCa cells. Importantly, administration of agomir-133a-3p greatly suppresses the incidence of PCa bone metastasis in vivo. Our results further demonstrate that miR-133a-3p suppresses bone metastasis of PCa via inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling by directly targeting multiple cytokine receptors, including EGFR, FGFR1, IGF1R and MET. The negative clinical correlation of miR-133a-3p with EGFR, FGFR1, IGF1R, MET and PI3K/AKT signaling activity is determined in clinical PCa tissues.  Conclusion:   Our results unveil a novel mechanism by which miR-133a-3p inhibits bone metastasis of PCa, providing the evidence that miR-133a-3p may serve as a potential bone metastasis marker in PCa, and delivery of agomir-133a-3p may be an effective anti-bone metastasis therapeutic strategy in PCa.""","""['Yubo Tang', 'Jincheng Pan', 'Shuai Huang', 'Xinsheng Peng', 'Xuenong Zou', 'Yongxiang Luo', 'Dong Ren', 'Xin Zhang', 'Ronggang Li', 'Peiheng He', 'Qingde Wa']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Downregulation of miR-141-3p promotes bone metastasis via activating NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Transcriptional downregulation of miR-133b by REST promotes prostate cancer metastasis to bone via activating TGF-β signaling.', 'Role of Metastasis-Related microRNAs in Prostate Cancer Progression and Treatment.', 'Ras and Wnt Interaction Contribute in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Antagonizing exosomal miR-18a-5p derived from prostate cancer cells ameliorates metastasis-induced osteoblastic lesions by targeting Hist1h2bc and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'A novel long noncoding RNA AC125257.1 facilitates colorectal cancer progression by targeting miR-133a-3p/CASC5 axis.', 'Hsa-miR-133a-3p, miR-1-3p, GOLPH3 and JUP combination results in a good biomarker to distinguish between prostate cancer and non-prostate cancer patients.', 'hsa-mir-133a-2 promotes the proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells by targeting the LAMB3-mediated PI3K/ATK pathway.']"""

Methods:   Our cohort consisted of 320 patients indicated for radical prostatectomy with preoperative measurements of total prostate-specific antigen, free prostate-specific antigen, [-2]proPSA, calculated %freePSA, and Prostate Health Index. The Gleason score was determined during biopsy and after radical prostatectomy. Using the Gleason score, we divided the group of patients into the 2 subgroups: Gleason score ≤6 and Gleason score >6. This division was performed according to the biopsy Gleason score and according to the postoperative Gleason score. We compared total prostate-specific antigen, [-2]proPSA, %freePSA, and Prostate Health Index in the subgroups Gleason score ≤6 and Gleason score >6 after biopsy and the definitive score.  Results:   On evaluation of the subgroups created by Gleason score ≤6 and Gleason score >6, we observed agreement between biopsy Gleason score and definitive Gleason score in only 45.3% of cases. Of the calculated biopsy, Gleason score ≤6 and Gleason score >6 subgroups, [-2]proPSA, and Prostate Health Index ( P = .0003 and P = .0005) were statistically significant. Of the definitive Gleason score ≤6 and Gleason score >6 subgroups, Prostate Health Index, [-2]proPSA, %freePSA, and PSA ( P < .0001, P < .0001, P = .0003, and P = .0043) were statistically significant. The best area under the curve value (0.7496) was achieved by Prostate Health Index when the subgroups were established according to the postoperative Gleason score.  Conclusion:   Prostate Health Index is the best of the tested markers for the categorization of Gleason score 6 tumors and for facilitating the management of patients with prostate cancer.

The aberrant expression of the Cbx7 gene is implicated in several cancers including prostate, gastric, thyroid, pancreas, and colon cancer. Previous reports on antagonizing the molecular recognition of Cbx7-H3K27me3 with chemical inhibitors showed an impact on prostate cancer cell lines. We report here on the design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of a series of potent peptidomimetic antagonists that were optimized on a trimethyllysine-containing scaffold to target Cbx7. The ligands were characterized using fluorescence polarization (FP) for their binding efficiency and selectivity against the Pc paralog Cbx proteins. The most selective ligand 9, as indicated by the FP data analysis, was further characterized using the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Compound 9 exhibits a 220 nM potency for Cbx7 and exhibits 3.3, 1.8, 7.3 times selective for Cbx7 over Cbx2/4/8 and 28-fold selective over the HP1 family member Cbx1. Our research provides several potent and partially selective inhibitors for Cbx2/4/7 that do not contain trimethyllysine.

Patients and methods:   We used baseline data (questionnaires completed after treatment information was provided but before treatment) of 426 patients with newly diagnosed localised prostate cancer who participated (87% response rate) in a prospective, longitudinal, multicentre study. Patients' pretreatment perceptions of differences in adverse outcomes of treatments were compared to those based on the literature. We used univariate and multivariate linear regression to identify correlates of misperceptions.  Results:   About two-thirds (68%, n = 211) of the patients did not understand that the risk of disease recurrence is comparable between RP and RT.

TRUS-guided biopsy can cause side effects and has relatively poor diagnostic accuracy. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) used as a triage test might allow men to avoid unnecessary TRUS-guided biopsy and improve diagnostic accuracy.  Objectives:   To (1) assess the ability of mpMRI to identify men who can safely avoid unnecessary biopsy, (2) assess the ability of the mpMRI-based pathway to improve the rate of detection of clinically significant (CS) cancer compared with TRUS-guided biopsy and (3) estimate the cost-effectiveness of a mpMRI-based diagnostic pathway.  Design:   A validating paired-cohort study and an economic evaluation using a decision-analytic model.  Setting:   Eleven NHS hospitals in England.  Participants:   Men at risk of prostate cancer undergoing a first prostate biopsy.  Interventions:   Participants underwent three tests: (1) mpMRI (the index test), (2) TRUS-guided biopsy (the current standard) and (3) template prostate mapping (TPM) biopsy (the reference test).  Main outcome measures:   Diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI, TRUS-guided biopsy and TPM-biopsy measured by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) using primary and secondary definitions of CS cancer. The percentage of negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was used to identify men who might be able to avoid biopsy.  Results:   Diagnostic study - a total of 740 men were registered and 576 underwent all three tests. According to TPM-biopsy, the prevalence of any cancer was 71% [95% confidence interval (CI) 67% to 75%]. The prevalence of CS cancer according to the primary definition (a Gleason score of ≥ 4 + 3 and/or cancer core length of ≥ 6 mm) was 40% (95% CI 36% to 44%). For CS cancer, TRUS-guided biopsy showed a sensitivity of 48% (95% CI 42% to 55%), specificity of 96% (95% CI 94% to 98%), PPV of 90% (95% CI 83% to 94%) and NPV of 74% (95% CI 69% to 78%). The sensitivity of mpMRI was 93% (95% CI 88% to 96%), specificity was 41% (95% CI 36% to 46%), PPV was 51% (95% CI 46% to 56%) and NPV was 89% (95% CI 83% to 94%). A negative mpMRI scan was recorded for 158 men (27%). Of these, 17 were found to have CS cancer on TPM-biopsy. Economic evaluation - the most cost-effective strategy involved testing all men with mpMRI, followed by MRI-guided TRUS-guided biopsy in those patients with suspected CS cancer, followed by rebiopsy if CS cancer was not detected. This strategy is cost-effective at the TRUS-guided biopsy definition 2 (any Gleason pattern of ≥ 4 and/or cancer core length of ≥ 4 mm), mpMRI definition 2 (lesion volume of ≥ 0.2 ml and/or Gleason score of ≥ 3 + 4) and cut-off point 2 (likely to be benign) and detects 95% (95% CI 92% to 98%) of CS cancers. The main drivers of cost-effectiveness were the unit costs of tests, the improvement in sensitivity of MRI-guided TRUS-guided biopsy compared with blind TRUS-guided biopsy and the longer-term costs and outcomes of men with cancer.  Limitations:   The PROstate Magnetic resonance Imaging Study (PROMIS) was carried out in a selected group and excluded men with a prostate volume of > 100 ml, who are less likely to have cancer. The limitations in the economic modelling arise from the limited evidence on the long-term outcomes of men with prostate cancer and on the sensitivity of MRI-targeted repeat biopsy.  Conclusions:   Incorporating mpMRI into the diagnostic pathway as an initial test prior to prostate biopsy may (1) reduce the proportion of men having unnecessary biopsies, (2) improve the detection of CS prostate cancer and (3) increase the cost-effectiveness of the prostate cancer diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. The PROMIS data set will be used for future research; this is likely to include modelling prognostic factors for CS cancer, optimising MRI scan sequencing and biomarker or translational research analyses using the blood and urine samples collected. Better-quality evidence on long-term outcomes in prostate cancer under the various management strategies is required to better assess cost-effectiveness.

A pilot study""","""Purpose:   In patients considered for active surveillance (AS), the use of MRI and targeted biopsies (TB) at entry challenges the approach of routine ""per protocol"" repeat systematic biopsies (SB) at 1 year. This pilot study aimed to assess whether an approach of performing repeat biopsies only if PSA kinetics are abnormal would be safe and sufficient to detect progression.  Methods:   Prospective single-centre study of 149 patients on AS with low-risk PCa, a negative MRI at entry, followed for a minimum of 12 months between 01/2007 and 12/2015. Group 1 (n = 78) patients had per-protocol 12-month repeat SB; group 2 (n = 71) patients did not. Surveillance tests for tumour progression were for both groups: for cause SB and MRI-TB biopsies if PSA velocity (PSA-V) > 0.75 ng/ml/year, or PSA doubling time (PSADT) < 3 years. The main objectives are to compare the 2-year rates of tumour progression and AS discontinuation between groups. The secondary objectives are to estimate the diagnostic power of PSA-V and PSA-DT, to predict the risk of tumour progression.  Results:   Overall, 21 out of 149 patients (14.1%) showed tumour progression, 17.1% for group 1 and 12.3% for group 2, and 31 (21.2%) discontinued AS at 2 years. There was no difference between the 2 groups (p = 0.56). The area under the PSA-V and PSADT curves to predict tumour progression was 0.92 and 0.83, respectively.  Conclusions:   We did not find any significant difference for progression and AS discontinuation rate between the 2 groups. The PSA kinetic seems accurate as a marker of tumour progression.

However, human studies examining its effect on delaying disease progression while on hormone therapy are limited. This study explores the effect of celecoxib use on PC survival in VA patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for advanced PC. We retrospectively examined the association between celecoxib use (defined as duration of medication use ≥180 days) in men with PC being treated with ADT in national VA databases. Patients were diagnosed with PC from 2000-2008 and had follow-up through May 2016. Clinical, pathologic and demographic variables were compared by celecoxib use, using Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-squared tests. Associations between celecoxib use and overall survival (OS), skeletal related events (SRE), and cancer specific survival (CSS) were performed using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. Overall, 87,344 patients with PC on ADT were identified. Patients on celecoxib (n=1,581) had lower PSA levels at both diagnosis (7.0 versus 8.7 ng/mL, P<0.001) and initiation of ADT (6.2 versus 7.3 ng/mL, P=0.002) compared to patients not taking celecoxib (n=85,763).

Materials and methods:   This phase I/II trial treatment was designed to improve 5-year bDFS from ~ 75 to 90%. Patients were consecutively enrolled using the following inclusion criteria: age < 80 years, histological diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma without known metastases, stage pT2-4N0-1, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. All patients had at least one of these pathologic features: capsular perforation, positive surgical margins, seminal vesicle invasion, and pelvic lymph nodes involvement. A minimum dose of 64.8 Gy to the tumor bed was delivered in all patients. Depending on tumor characteristics at diagnosis, patients received a higher dose (70.2 Gy; 85.4%) and/or prophylactic pelvic lymph nodes irradiation (57.7%) and/or HT (69.1%). Biochemical relapse was defined as two consecutive rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values > 0.2 ng/ml.  Results:   A total of 123 patients were enrolled in the study and completed the scheduled treatment. Median preoperative and postoperative PSA were: 8.8 and 0.06 ng/mL, respectively.

An evaluation of MR-targeted biopsy yield by PIRADS score across different biopsy indications""","""Introduction:   Magnetic resonance imaging is being widely adopted in the clinical management of prostate cancer. The correlation of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) to the presence of cancer has been established but studies have primarily evaluated this in a single clinical setting. This study aims to characterize the correlation of PIRADS score to the diagnosis of cancer on fusion biopsy among men who are undergoing primary biopsy, those who have had a previous negative biopsy or men on active surveillance.  Materials & methods:   A consecutive sample of men undergoing US-MR biopsy at a single academic institution from 2014 to 2017 were included in this retrospective study. Men were stratified into groups according to their clinical history: biopsy-naïve, previous negative transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy or on active surveillance. The correlation of PIRADS score to the diagnosis of any and clinically significant cancer (Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4) was determined.  Results:   A total of 255 patients with 365 discrete lesions were analyzed. PIRADS score 1-2, 3, 4 and 5 yielded any prostate cancer in 7.7, 29.7, 42.3 and 82.4% of the cases, respectively, across all indications while clinically significant cancer was found in 0, 8.9, 21.4 and 62.7%, respectively. The area under the receiver operative curves for the diagnosis of any and significant cancer was 0.69 (95%CI: 0.64-0.74) and 0.74 (95%CI: 0.69-0.79) respectively. Men who have had a previous negative biopsy had lower detection rates for any prostate cancer for PIRADS 3 and 4 lesions compared to those that were biopsy-naïve or on active surveillance.  Conclusion:   Cancer detection rates are significantly associated with PIRADS score. Biopsy yields differ across biopsy indications which should be considered when selecting a PIRADS score threshold for biopsy. Biopsy of PIRADS 3 lesions could potentially be avoided in men who have previously undergone a negative TRUS biopsy.""","""['Niranjan J Sathianathen', 'Badrinath R Konety', 'Ayman Soubra', 'Gregory J Metzger', 'Benjamin Spilseth', 'Paari Murugan', 'Christopher J Weight', 'Maria A Ordonez', 'Christopher A Warlick']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy of the prostate: Quality of image fusion in a clinical setting.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'MR-targeted TRUS prostate biopsy using local reference augmentation: initial experience.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate and targeted biopsy, Comparison of PIRADS and Gleason grading.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'A prospective study of the prostate health index density and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Can a prostate biopsy be safely deferred on PI-RADS 1,2 or 3 lesions seen on pre-biopsy mp-MRI?', 'Role of the elastography strain ratio using transrectal ultrasonography in the diagnosis of prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Usefulness of grayscale values of hypoechoic lesions matched with target lesions observed on magnetic resonance imaging for the prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic value of combining PI-RADS v2.1 with PSAD in clinically significant prostate cancer.']"""

We investigated changes in the mpMRI appearance of lesions on AS, to show the variability of volume measurements in visible lesions and assess change in lesion size according to grade.  Methods:   We retrospectively retrieved 86 men on AS (NICE guidelines) with more than one mpMRI (the first before 2013). Two radiologists, in consensus, were blinded to patient demographics and date of scan. The scans were randomly reported to reduce any bias. For visible lesions, we measured volume by planimetry on the sequence best showing the most conspicuous (index) tumour and attributed a 5-point Likert score.  Results:   43/86 men did not have a visible lesion on the initial mpMRI (≤2/5). Of these, 5/43 had developed a lesion scoring ≥3/5 at a median of 3.6 years of follow up. 40/86 had a lesion scoring ≥3/5 on two or more scans. There was a significant increase in volume over 3.6 years by a median of 10% (p < 0.01)-by a median of 6% for Gleason 3+3 and 18% for 3+4 (p = 0.058). Thirty-five men had a visible lesion on two scans separated by <2 years; of these, 21/35 showed a 78% median increase in tumour size between the two scans and 11/35 showed an apparent 25% median decrease in lesion size.  Conclusions:   A total of 17% of men with no visible lesion developed a visible lesion at a median follow up of 3.6 years. It is possible to show significant growth in patients with a visible lesion, but variability in volume measurements between scans means that it is difficult to reliably detect increases of this order. This variability may inform the design of mpMRI protocols in AS and the time between follow up scans.""","""['Francesco Giganti', 'Caroline M Moore', 'Shonit Punwani', 'Clare Allen', 'Mark Emberton', 'Alex Kirkham']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Index Tumor Detection: Correlation with Radical Prostatectomy Specimen.', 'The influence of prostate-specific antigen density on positive and negative predictive values of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to detect Gleason score 7-10 prostate cancer in a repeat biopsy setting.', 'Risk-based Patient Selection for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsy after Negative Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Random Biopsy Avoids Unnecessary Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

However, few data are available regarding the morbidity of radical prostatectomy in the metastatic setting. We addressed intra- and postoperative complications of CRP relative to radical prostatectomy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer (nmRP). Within the National Inpatient Sample database (2008-2013), we identified patients who underwent CRP versus nmRP. Propensity score matching to reduce the effect of inherent differences between CRP and nmRP patients, multivariable logistic regression models, Poisson regression models, and linear regression models were used. Of 76 378 patients, 1.2% (n=953) underwent CRP. CRP resulted in higher rates of overall (odds ratio [OR]: 1.34, p=0.01), intraoperative (OR: 2.61, p=0.005), and miscellaneous surgical complications (OR: 1.69, p=0.02). Moreover, CRP was associated with longer stay (OR: 1.07, p=0.01) and higher total hospital charges ($810 more per surgery, p=0.0004). Intra- and postoperative complications associated with CRP are higher than those of nmRP. Similarly, an increase in total hospital charges is associated with CRP.

This paper examines traditional approaches to pricing and the evolution of value-based pricing (VBP), and proposes a new framework for evidence-based valuation (EBV). The main objective of EBV is to estimate the value-based pricing range for the new medicine, identify key product attributes that drive value as perceived by various stakeholders, and then elucidate the requisite evidence to support those value claims.  Methods:   EBV centers on a structured framework for estimating a drug's price based on its perceived value to various stakeholders. The EBV framework consists of identifying key value attributes that drive adoption of a drug in a given therapeutic area; gaining insights into stakeholder value considerations and evidence requirements; and quantifying stakeholders' perceptions of specific value attributes within pricing premiums.  Results:   An example demonstrates the application of the EBV framework in a simplified manner for 3 drugs indicated for renal cell carcinoma, 3 drugs for prostate cancer, and 1 drug for melanoma. HTAs, published trial results, and publications archived in PubMed between 2005 and 2013 were analyzed to identify key value attributes. The following 5 attributes were considered: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), population size, trial comparator, and adverse events.

One hundred and fifty-seven patients (67%) received three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy while 77 patients (33%) were treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or IMRT/image-guided radiotherapy by tomotherapy. The median RT dose to prostate bed was 70.2 Gy (range: 66-79 Gy).

In a previous study, our group discovered intriguing differences in the oxidative mitochondrial respiration capacity of benign and prostate cancer (PCa) cells. In particular, we found that PCa cells had a higher total respiratory activity than benign cells. Moreover, PCa cells showed a substantial shift towards succinate-supported mitochondrial respiration compared to benign cells, indicating a re-programming of respiratory control. This study aimed to investigate the role of succinate and its main plasma membrane transporter NaDC3 (sodium-dependent dicarboxylate transporter member 3) in PCa cells and to determine whether targeting succinate metabolism can be potentially used to inhibit PCa cell growth. Using high-resolution respirometry analysis, we observed that ROUTINE respiration in viable cells and succinate-supported respiration in permeabilized cells was higher in cells lacking the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin-homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), which is frequently lost in PCa. In addition, loss of PTEN was associated with increased intracellular succinate accumulation and higher expression of NaDC3. However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NaDC3 only moderately influenced succinate metabolism and did not affect PCa cell growth. By contrast, mersalyl acid-a broad acting inhibitor of dicarboxylic acid carriers-strongly interfered with intracellular succinate levels and resulted in reduced numbers of PCa cells. These findings suggest that blocking NaDC3 alone is insufficient to intervene with altered succinate metabolism associated with PCa. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that loss of PTEN is associated with increased succinate accumulation and enhanced succinate-supported respiration, which cannot be overcome by inhibiting the succinate transporter NaDC3 alone.""","""['Anja Weber', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Herbert Oberacher', 'Erich Gnaiger', 'Hannes Neuwirt', 'Natalie Sampson', 'Iris E Eder']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Tumor microenvironment promotes dicarboxylic acid carrier-mediated transport of succinate to fuel prostate cancer mitochondria.', 'Molecular aspects of gefitinib antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in PTEN-positive and PTEN-negative prostate cancer cell lines.', 'A HIF-1alpha-dependent autocrine feedback loop promotes survival of serum-deprived prostate cancer cells.', 'PTEN in cancer, metabolism, and aging.', 'Multiple faces of succinate beyond metabolism in blood.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Succinate at the Crossroad of Metabolism and Angiogenesis: Roles of SDH, HIF1α and SUCNR1.', 'Enhanced Succinate Oxidation with Mitochondrial Complex II Reactive Oxygen Species Generation in Human Prostate Cancer.', 'Wolframin deficiency is accompanied with metabolic inflexibility in rat striated muscles.', 'Controlled power: how biology manages succinate-driven energy release.']"""

All samples were subjected to analysis by immunoblotting and RT-qPCR.  Results and conclusions:   The preliminary results allow us to hypothesize the involvement of STAT3, through both its canonical and non-canonical pathways, in response to β-HCH.

Here, we provide first-time evidence for the oncogenic role of COBRA1 in prostate pathogenesis. COBRA1 is aberrantly expressed in prostate tumors. It positively influences androgen receptor (AR) target gene expression and promoter activity. Depletion of COBRA1 leads to decreased cell viability, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth in prostate cancer cell lines. Conversely, overexpression of COBRA1 significantly increases cell viability, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth over the higher basal levels. Remarkably, AR-positive androgen dependent (LNCaP) cells overexpressing COBRA1 survive under androgen-deprivation conditions. Remarkably, treatment of prostate cancer cells with well-studied antitumorigenic agent, 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME₂), caused significant DNA methylation changes in 3255 genes including COBRA1. Furthermore, treatment of prostate cancer cells with 2-ME₂ downregulates COBRA1 and inhibition of prostate tumors in TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinomas of mouse prostate) animals with 2-ME₂ was also associated with decreased COBRA1 levels.

This represents one of the largest published series of patients at intermediate and high risk.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective multicenter analysis of patients who underwent partial gland ablation between January 2013 and September 2017. Patients with biopsy proven localized disease and limited multifocality based on magnetic resonance imaging who preferred minimally invasive outpatient therapy were treated with the Sonablate® 500 system. Oncologic and functional outcomes were analyzed as well as risk factors for recurrence.  Results:   A total of 166 procedures were performed in 150 patients. Grade Group 2 or greater was present in 89% of cases. Mean ± SD followup was 24.3 ± 14.4 months. Mean prostate specific antigen decreased 65% from 7.9 ± 6.8 ng/ml to a nadir of 2.7 ± 3.1 ng/ml. Confirmatory biopsies were performed in 87 patients (52%) at high risk for recurrence. Clinically significant cancer (Grade Group 2 or greater) was detected in 37 cases (42%). Patients with a higher number of positive cores, a medial tumor location or higher prostate specific antigen had a higher probability of recurrence. Salvage treatment was done in 37 patients (24.6%), including 16 repeat partial gland ablation procedures.

Evidence reported in the literature suggests that zinc may be related to prostate cancer. In this study we evaluated the association of serum zinc levels and polymorphisms in genes encoding zinc-dependent proteins with prostate cancer in Poland.  Methods:   The study group consisted of 197 men affected with prostate cancer and 197 healthy men. Serum zinc levels were measured and 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms in MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-13, MT2A genes were genotyped.  Results:   The mean serum zinc level was higher in prostate cancer patients than in healthy controls (898.9±12.01 μg/l vs. 856.6±13.05 μg/l, p<0.01). When compared in quartiles a significant association of higher zinc concentration with the incidence of prostate cancer was observed. The highest OR (OR = 4.41, 95%CI 2.07-9.37, p<0.01) was observed in 3rd quartile (>853.0-973.9 μg/l). Among five analyzed genetic variants, rs11568818 in MMP-7 appeared to be correlated with 2-fold increased prostate cancer risk (OR = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.19-4.82, p = 0.015).

This study aimed to investigate diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   From 2016 to 2017, 19 prostate cancer patients were evaluated by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT at the Urology Clinic of S.P Botkin City Clinical Hospital; 17 of them had a biochemical recurrence and needed restaging of the disease. The age, prostate specific antigen (PSA) values, therapy at the time of the study, and maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) were evaluated.  Results:   The median age of patients was 65 years (interquartile range (IQR) 58.5-70.5), the median total PSA level was 2.36 ng/mL (IQR 1.5-4.19). In 8 of 17 patients, the PSA values did not exceed 2 ng/ml. The median time after radical prostatectomy was 33.2 months. (IQR 12-54.5). Positive PET/CT sites of recurrence were detected in 15 of 17 patients. Nine patients had only one positive site, and in six patients several positive sites were detected. Four patients with PET/CT positive pelvic lymph nodes and/or retroperitoneal space underwent salvage lymphadenectomy.

The gold standard for the detection of prostate cancer is ultrasound guided transrectal prostate biopsy. The detectability of cancer using this method is from 30 to 50%. As a result, many men undergo multiple repeat biopsies for suspected prostate cancer. The European Association of Urology does not give any recommendations on this matter. A revolutionary new method in the diagnosis of prostate cancer is a targeted prostate biopsy using a fusion of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound.  Materials and methods:   At the R.M. Fronstein Clinic of Urology, 55 patients with suspected prostate cancer from September 2017 to January 2018 underwent fusion prostate biopsy. Of them, 21 patients had negative primary biopsies. Two patients had verified prostate cancer. 32 patients did not undergo primary biopsies.  Results:   The findings of the study suggest that using MRI-ultrasound fusion for guidance of targeted prostate biopsy improves the quality of the histological material, allows patients to avoid unnecessary biopsy, reduces the number of punctures, thereby offering higher diagnostic performance in detecting prostate cancer. MRI-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy has a high sensitivity in detecting clinically significant cancer and low for clinically insignificant cancers.

The indication for the procedure is an elevated level of the serum level of the total prostate-specific antigen (PSA). However, the PSA test is organ- but not cancer-specific, and patients may undergo an unnecessary biopsy, which is an invasive procedure associated with a risk of complications. Additional tests have been developed aimed to improve the diagnostic performance of PSA for detecting PCa. They include PSA derivatives such as free PSA fraction, -2proPSA, PSA density, PHI and the free /total PSA fraction.  Aim:   To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of PSA and its derivatives in detecting benign and malignant diseases of the prostate after an initial prostate biopsy.  Materials and methods:   The current study analyzed 65 initial biopsies performed due to an elevated serum PSA level and compared them with the results of extended PSA testing with the use of PSA derivatives.  Results:   The histological findings consistent with PCa were found in about 30% of initial biopsies performed due to elevated serum levels of total PSA. The incidence of histologically confirmed PCa increased with age, and 70-79 year old men were more likely to have it than 60-69 years old patients. PSA density in 85% of PCa cases exceeded that for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In all PCa patients, PHI and free /total PSA fraction were greater than 25 and less than 0.15, respectively. In most patients with BPH, the PHI and free /total PSA fraction did not exceed 25 and were greater than 0.15.  Conclusions:   1. Initial biopsy triggered by elevated serum level of total PSA allows detection of PCa in about 30% of cases. 2. The age of 60 years and older should be regarded as a risk factor for PCa. The probability of malignant transformation of prostate epithelial cells in men over 70 years of age is greater than in 60-69-year-olds. 3. The density of PSA in men with morphologically verified PCa is statistically significantly greater than that in men with BPH and the threshold value in 85% of cases. 4. Determination of PHI and free/total PSA fraction can improve the accuracy of predicting malignant lesions of the prostate and adjust the indications for histological examination, reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. 5. When defining indications for initial prostate biopsy in cases with serum PSA varying from 2 to 10 ng/ml, PSA derivatives should be used, including PSA density, prostate health index, and the free /total PSA fraction.""","""['S V Popov', 'R G Guseinov', 'O N Skryabin', 'I N Orlov', 'A G Martov']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['Optimal predictors of prostate cancer on repeat prostate biopsy: a prospective study of 1,051 men.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Relationship of chronic histologic prostatic inflammation in biopsy specimens with serum isoform -2proPSA (p2PSA), %p2PSA, and prostate health index in men with a total prostate-specific antigen of 4-10 ng/ml and normal digital rectal examination.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'The incidence of the variability of the free PSA/total PSA ratio on the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Knockdown of ferritin heavy chain (FTH) inhibits the migration of prostate cancer through reducing S100A4, S100A2, and S100P expression.']"""

The specific tumor enhancement of the agent was investigated in male nude mice bearing aggressive PC3 human prostate cancer xenografts and slow-growing LNCaP tumor xenografts. Contrast enhanced MR images were acquired using a 2D spin-echo sequence and a 3D FLASH sequence with a 7 T small animal scanner. ZD2-N3-Gd(HP-DO3A) produced robust contrast enhancement in aggressive PC3 tumors and little enhancement in slow-growing LNCaP tumors. It produced 400% and 100% CNR increases in the T1-weighted 2D spin-echo MR images and 3D FLASH images of PC3 tumors, respectively, for at least 30 min at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg. In contrast, less than 20% CNR increase was observed in the LNCaP tumors with both sequences. The optimized targeted contrast agent has higher relaxivities and are effective to detect aggressive PC3 tumors and differentiate the aggressive cancer from the slow-growing LNCaP prostate cancer in contrast enhanced MRI.

Recently, several studies have demonstrated that the cancer liquid biopsy can be implemented by using exosome miRNAs. However, the current methods for the detection of exosome miRNAs are time-consuming, expensive, and laborious. Thus, we investigated a novel method for diagnosing prostate cancer that involves the use of molecular beacons for the in situ detection of miRNAs in exosomes from prostate cancer cells. We chose miRNA-375 and miRNA-574-3p as the target miRNAs for prostate cancer, and these markers in exosomes produced by prostate cancer cells including DU145 and PC-3 were successfully detected using molecular beacons. High fluorescent signals were obtained from MB and miRNA hybridization in exosomes in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, exosome miRNAs can be detected even in the presence of human urine, so this method can be applied directly using human urine to perform liquid biopsies for prostate cancer. Overall, the in situ detection of exosome miRNAs using molecular beacons can be developed as a simple, cost effective, and non-invasive liquid biopsy for diagnosing prostate cancer.""","""['Jinhee Lee', 'Min Hee Kwon', 'Jeong Ah Kim', 'Won Jong Rhee']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol""","""['Simultaneous multiplexed detection of exosomal microRNAs and surface proteins for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Simultaneous and multiplexed detection of exosome microRNAs using molecular beacons.', 'Lectin-induced agglutination method of urinary exosomes isolation followed by mi-RNA analysis: Application for prostate cancer diagnostic.', 'Exosomal microRNAs in liquid biopsies: future biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Urinary biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'Role of microRNA carried by small extracellular vesicles in urological tumors.', 'miRNAs as Predictors of Barrier Integrity.', 'Design of a printed electrochemical strip towards miRNA-21 detection in urine samples: optimization of the experimental procedures for real sample application.', 'Reassessing the Abundance of miRNAs in the Human Pancreas and Rodent Cell Lines and Its Implication.', 'Recent Advances in Exosomal miRNA Biosensing for Liquid Biopsy.']"""

Although data suggest a relationship between sexual function and sexual satisfaction, it is unclear whether presurgical levels of sexual satisfaction are attained for men who ""recover"" erections post-RP.  Aim:   The goal of this analysis is to determine whether the recovery of erectile function restores presurgical levels of sexual satisfaction.  Methods:   We assessed 229 men pre-RP and 24-months post-RP. At both time points, participants completed the Erectile Function Domain (EFD) and the Intercourse Satisfaction Domain (ISD) of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Erectile function recovery at 24 months was defined as (1) (EFD≥24) or (2) EFD back to baseline (BTB). One hundred sixty-six men with penetration hardness erections (PHEs) at baseline (EFD >24) were included in the analyses. Repeated measure t-tests were used to compare changes in ISD scores and effect size (Cohen's d) was calculated to determine the clinical significance of these changes. Multivariable analyses (MVA) were used to test the relationship between EFD and ISD.  Results:   The mean age of men was 58 (SD = 7) years. The mean EFD score at baseline was 29 (SD = 2), which declined significantly to 20 (SD = 10) at 24 months. ISD also decreased significantly between baseline and 24 months (12 to 8.3, P < .001, d = 0.87), even among men with PHEs at 24 months (12.3 to 11.3, P < .001, d = 0.50) and men who achieved BTB erections at 24 months (12.4 to 11.7, P = .02, d = 0.35). For men with PHEs at 24 months, MVAs identified baseline ISD (beta = 0.46) and 24-month EFD (beta = 0.23) as the only significant predictors of 24-month ISD. However, among men who achieved BTB erections at 24 months, baseline ISD (beta = 0.49) was the only significant predictor of 24-month ISD.  Clinical implications:   These findings underscore the importance of the integration of psychological support and medical care to best meet the needs of patients. Furthermore, these results can be used to facilitate pre-RP communication and counseling with patients to improve understanding and manage post-RP expectations.  Strengths & limitations:   The study methodology, specifically the use of BTB as a means of defining erectile function and the longitudinal, prospective study design are relative strengths. Despite the longitudinal design, the study did not include a control group of healthy, age-matched men.  Conclusion:   Results highlight the enduring impact of sexual dysfunction, namely erectile dysfunction, on intercourse satisfaction following RP and suggest that restoration of function in and of itself does not ensure the restoration of satisfaction.

Materials and methods:   134 consecutive treatment naive patients (mean age 64 years, range 41-82 years) underwent MRI-directed prostate biopsy. MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy was used for 77 (77/134 = 57.5%) patients, cognitive fusion for 51 (51/134 = 38.0%) patients, and 6 patients (6/134 = 4.5%) without a target nodule had systematic biopsy only. Out of the 1676 biopsy sites, 237 (237/1676 = 14.1%) were positive on MRI for a PIRADS 3, 4, or 5 nodule. Fifty-eight (58/134, 43.3%) patients had clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). The findings on MRI using PIRADS version 2 were correlated with the biopsy results.  Results:   The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of PIRADS ≥ 3 for csPCa were 89%, 76.5%, 89.7%, 31.7%, and 98.4%, respectively. The detection rates of csPCa for PIRADS 3, 4, and 5 nodules were 6.1% (4/66), 33.3% (42/126), and 64.4% (29/45), respectively. MRI did not identify a nodule in 23/1676 (1.4%) biopsy sites that contained csPCa. The MRI reader, biopsy operator, method of fusion biopsy, and zonal location of prostate nodule did not significantly affect the odds of having a biopsy result positive for csPCa.  Conclusion:   PIRADS ≥ 3 had high specificity and high negative predictive value for csPCa using biopsy results as the standard of reference.

Previous studies have shown that men undergoing ADT develop insulin resistance and diabetes, but the mechanisms behind ADT-induced metabolic abnormalities remain unclear.  Objective:   To evaluate the role of inflammatory cytokines and adipocyte protein-2 (aP2) in ADT-induced metabolic dysfunction.  Participants and interventions:   This 6-month prospective cohort study enrolled nondiabetic men with PCa about to undergo ADT (ADT group) and a control group of nondiabetic men who had previously undergone prostatectomy for localized PCa and were in remission (non-ADT group); all participants had normal testosterone at study entry. Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks after initiation of ADT and at the same intervals in the non-ADT group. Glucose, insulin, lipids, inflammatory cytokines, and C-reactive protein were measured. We also measured serum aP2, an adipocyte-secreted protein that promotes hepatic glucose production. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated.  Results:   Seventy-three participants formed the analytical sample (33 ADT, 40 non-ADT). HOMA-IR increased in the ADT group (estimated change = 0.25; P = 0.05), but was unchanged in the non-ADT group (0.11; P = 0.342). Serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines or aP2 did not change significantly. There was a treatment-associated increase in total (16 mg/dL; P < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein (8 mg/dL; P < 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein (7 mg/dL; P = 0.02) cholesterol.

Unfortunately, despite significant advances in radiation delivery, prostate cancer radioresistance occurs in a large proportion of patients undergoing radiotherapy. As a way to enhance radiotherapy effectiveness, research advances into the mechanisms regulating the immune response have revived interest in combination radiation and immune-based therapies.  Methods:   miR-195/-16 family and PD-L1 levels were analyzed in samples from a GSE21032 data set. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the difference in biochemical recurrence-free survival associated with miR-195 and miR-16 expression. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to evaluate the miR-195, miR-16 and PD-L1 expression. Then, we used bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay to predict and confirm the miR-195 and miR-16 target gene. Finally, we elucidate the miR-195 and miR-16 function on immune evasion in the DU145/T cell co-culture model and syngeneic mouse model treated with radiotion through qRT-PCR, western blot, Flow cytometry and ELISA.  Results:   High levels of miR-195 and miR-16 were positively correlated with the biochemical recurrence-free survival of prostate cancer patients. miR-195 and miR-16 were inversely correlated with PD-L1, PD-1, CD80 and CTLA-4 expression. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-195 and miR-16 inhibited PD-L1 expression. Additionally, restoration of miR-195 and miR-16 expression enhanced radiotherapy via T cell activation in the tumor microenvironment by blocking PD-L1 expression. This synergistic effect of immunotherapy and radiotherapy was associated with the proliferation of functional cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and inhibition of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells.  Conclusions:   Our data revealbiological and functional interactions between immunotherapy and radiotherapy through the miR-195/-16 family regulatory cascade.""","""['Zhen Tao', 'Shaohua Xu', 'Hailong Ruan', 'Tao Wang', 'Wen Song', 'Li Qian', 'Ke Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Physiol Biochem""","""['miR-424(322) reverses chemoresistance via T-cell immune response activation by blocking the PD-L1 immune checkpoint.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

Incidence trends and survival rates could differ by age groups considering potential differences in the frequency of PSA testing, types of cancers and medical management. Our objective was to compare incidence trends and survival rates of prostate cancer between men aged ≥75 and 60-74 years.  Method:   We analyzed data from a population-based cancer registry in Isère, France. All men aged ≥60 years diagnosed with an incident prostate cancer during the 1991-2013 period were included.

Results:   In 2013, observed incidence rates were 557.6 and 568.7 per 100,000 for men aged 60-74 and ≥75, respectively, with high grades cancers more frequent among elderly men. The incidence and mortality trends among men aged ≥75 included a period of stability followed by a decreasing trend from 2003, whereas a peak of incidence was observed in 2005 for men aged 60-74. For both age groups, net survival rates increased with period of diagnosis and 8-year net survival remained higher than 70% for cases diagnosed in the 2000-2004 period. Lower survival rate of 51% (95%CI: 42%; 60%) was observed for high grades cancers diagnosed among men aged 75-84 in 2000-2004.

The selection of the most appropriate treatment should therefore reflect patients' preferences.  Objective:   The purpose of the following study was to pilot a new approach for investigating whether urologists who had previously provided patients with therapeutic advice actually knew their patients' importance weights concerning the relevant aspects of the treatments at issue.  Method:   Participants were patients recently diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (n = 20), urologists (n = 10), and non-medical professionals (architects, n = 10). These last served as a control group for the urologists and were matched to them for age and gender. Patients' importance weights were elicited by two standard methods (Direct Rating and Value Hierarchy). Each urologist was asked to estimate (with Direct Rating) his/her patient's importance weights. The same task was performed by a corresponding architect, who never met the patient and knew only the patient's age. Univariate and bivariate statistical analyses were performed to investigate the association between importance weights as elicited from patients and as estimated by urologists and architects, as well as to assess whether such agreement was attribute-dependent.  Results:   Participants found both elicitation methods easy to use. The correlation between patients' actual importance weights and urologists' estimates was poor and comparable to that obtained between patients and architects. This result did not depend on the attribute considered, with the sole exception of the attribute ""Effectiveness in curing the cancer"", which was evaluated as the most important attribute by the majority of participants.

Soon after discovery, microRNA dysregulation has been associated to several pathologies. In particular, they have often been reported as differentially expressed in healthy and tumor samples. This fact suggested that microRNAs are likely to be good candidate biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and personalized medicine. With the advent of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), measuring the expression level of the whole miRNAome at once is now routine. Yet, the collaborative effort of sharing data opens to the possibility of population analyses. This context motivated us to perform an in-silico study to distill cancer-specific panels of microRNAs that can serve as biomarkers. We observed that the problem of finding biomarkers can be modeled as a two-class classification task where, given the miRNAomes of a population of healthy and cancerous samples, we want to find the subset of microRNAs that leads to the highest classification accuracy. We fulfill this task leveraging on a sensible combination of data mining tools. In particular, we used: differential evolution for candidate selection, component analysis to preserve the relationships among miRNAs, and SVM for sample classification. We identified 10 cancer-specific panels whose classification accuracy is always higher than 92%. These panels have a very little overlap suggesting that miRNAs are not only predictive of the onset of cancer, but can be used for classification purposes as well. We experimentally validated the contribution of each of the employed tools to the selection of discriminating miRNAs.

By using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for 2000 through 2015, we examined trends in prevalence of cancer screening that adhered to US Preventive Services Task Force screening recommendations in order to monitor screening progress among traditionally underserved population subgroups.  Methods:   We analyzed NHIS data from surveys from 2000 through 2015 to estimate prevalence and trends in use of recommended screening tests for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers. We used logistic regression and report predictive margins for population subgroups adjusted for various socioeconomic and demographic variables.  Results:   Colorectal cancer screening was the only test that increased during the study period. We found disparities in prevalence of test use among subgroups for all tests examined. Factors that reduced the use of screening tests included no contact with a doctor in the past year, no usual source of health care, and no insurance coverage.  Conclusion:   Understanding use of cancer screening tests among different population subgroups is vital for planning public health interventions with potential to increase screening uptake and reduce disparities in cancer morbidity and mortality. Overarching goals of Healthy People 2020 are to ""achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups.""

Here, we found that epigenetic changes in prostatic cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) initiated a cascade of stromal-epithelial interactions. This facilitated lethal prostate cancer growth and development of resistance to androgen signaling deprivation therapy (ADT). We identified a Ras inhibitor, RASAL3, as epigenetically silenced in human prostatic CAF, leading to oncogenic Ras activity driving macropinocytosis-mediated glutamine synthesis. Interestingly, ADT further promoted RASAL3 epigenetic silencing and glutamine secretion by prostatic fibroblasts. In an orthotopic xenograft model, subsequent inhibition of macropinocytosis and glutamine transport resulted in antitumor effects. Stromal glutamine served as a source of energy through anaplerosis and as a mediator of neuroendocrine differentiation for prostate adenocarcinoma. Antagonizing the uptake of glutamine restored sensitivity to ADT in a castration-resistant xenograft model. In validating these findings, we found that prostate cancer patients on ADT with therapeutic resistance had elevated blood glutamine levels compared with those with therapeutically responsive disease (odds ratio = 7.451, P = 0.02).

CXCR7 exhibits oncogenic actions in various cancers. The aim of our study was to explore the clinical significance of CXCR7 in patients with PCa. MATERIAL AND METHODS QRT-PCR was used to detect the expression level of CXCR7 in PCa tissues. The relationship between CXCR7 expression and clinicopathologic parameters was evaluated by chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used for the survival analysis of patients. Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the potential of CXCR7 as a prognosis biomarker for PCa patients. We performed MTT and Transwell assays to determine the effect of CXCR7 on proliferative and migratory abilities of PCa cells, respectively. RESULTS CXCR7 was upregulated in PCa tissues (P<0.05) and was correlated with PSA (P=0.023), differentiation (P=0.022), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.018). The results of MTT and Transwell assays demonstrated that inhibition of CXCR7 suppressed PCa cells growth and migration. Additionally, high CXCR7 level predicted poor overall survival (log rank test, P=0.019). CXCR7 was a valuable prognostic biomarker for PCa patients (HR=2.271, 95%CI=1.093-4.719, P=0.028).

However, current anti-PI3K therapies fail to show long lasting in vivo effects. We find that not only the PI3Kα- and PI3kβ-isoforms, but also PI3Kδ, are associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process distinguishing indolent from aggressive prostate cancer. This suggests that cotargeting PI3Kα/β/δ could preempt the rebound activation of the parallel pathways induced by α- or β-isoform-selective inhibitor and prevent EMT. Indeed, BAY1082439, a new selective PI3Kα/β/δ inhibitor, is highly effective in vivo in inhibiting Pten-null prostate cancer growth and preventing EMT in the mutant Pten/Kras metastatic model. The anti-PI3Kδ property of BAY1082439 further blocks B-cell infiltration and lymphotoxin release, which are tumor microenvironment factors that promote castration-resistant growth.

The mechanism of irreversible electroporation ablation is thermal independent; thus, the main structures (eg, rectum, urethra, and neurovascular bundle) in prostate are spared during the treatment, which leads to the retention of prostate function. However, various clinical trials have shown that muscle contractions occur during this therapy, which warrants deep muscle anesthesia. Use of high-frequency bipolar pulses has been proposed to reduce muscle contractions during treatment, which has already triggered a multitude of studies at the cellular and animal scale. In this study, we first investigated the efficacy and safety of high-frequency bipolar pulses in human prostate cancer ablation. There are 40 male patients with prostate cancer aged between 51 and 85 years involved in this study. All patients received 250 high-frequency bipolar pulse bursts with the repeat frequency of 1 Hz. Each burst comprised 20 individual pulses of 5 microseconds, so one burst total energized time was 100 microseconds. The number of the electrodes ranged 2 to 6, depending on tumor size. A small amount of muscle relaxant was still needed, so there were no visible muscle contractions during the pulse delivery process. Four weeks after treatment, it was found that the ablation margins were distinct in magnetic resonance imaging scans, and the prostate capsule and urethra were retained. Eight patients underwent radical prostatectomy for pathological analysis after treatment, and the results of hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that the urethra and major vasculature in prostate have been preserved. By overlaying the electric field contour on the ablation zone, the electric field lethality threshold is determined to be 522 ± 74 V/cm.

Materials and methods:   Clinical routine prostate DWI datasets (b = 0, 50, 800 s/mm², acquired at a field strength of 3 T) of 104 consecutive patients with subsequent MR-guided prostate biopsy were included in this retrospective study. For each dataset exponential ADC maps (eADC), computed DWI images (cDWI), and additionally eADC maps for computed b-values of 2000 and 3000 s/mm² were generated (c_eADC). For each of 123 lesions, the contrast (CR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were determined. Differences in the CR and CNR of malignant lesions (n = 83) between the different image types and group differences between benign (n = 40), low-risk (n = 53) and high-risk (n = 30) lesions were assessed by repeated measures ANOVA and one-way ANOVA with post-hoc tests. The ability to differentiate between benign and malignant and between low-risk and high-risk lesions was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.  Results:   The CR and CNR were higher for computed DWI and related c_eADC at b = 3000 s/mm² and 2000 s/mm² compared to original DWI, conventional ADC and standard eADC. For differentiation of benign and malignant lesions, conventional ADC and CR of conventional ADC were best suited. For discrimination of low-risk from high-risk lesions, the CR of c_eADC was best suited followed by the CR of cDWI.  Conclusion:   Computed cDWI or related c_eADC maps at b-values between 2000 and 3000 s/mm2 were superior to the original DWI, conventional ADC and eADC in the detection of prostate cancer.

Methods:   The cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, and anti-metastatic effects of myricetin on prostate cancer cells were investigated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Short-hairpin RNA knockdown of the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus-1 (PIM1), pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, and an intracellular Ca2+ flux assay were used to investigate the potential underlying mechanism of myricetin. ONCOMINE database data mining and immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer tissues were used to evaluate the expression of PIM1 and CXCR4, as well as the correlation between PIM1 and CXCR4 expression and the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognoses of prostate cancer patients.

Materials and methods:   Retrospective study, IRB approved, including 122 patients who had suspicious lesion on MRI and who underwent prostate biopsy with ultrasonography (US)/MRI imaging fusion. There were 60 patients with positive biopsies and 62 with negative biopsies. MRI of these patients were randomized and evaluated independently by two blinded radiologists. The following variables were analyzed in each lesion: morphology, contours, T2 signal, diffusion restriction (subjective impression and objective values), hyper-enhancement, contact with transition zone or prostatic contour, prostatic contour retraction, Likert and PIRADS classification.  Results:   Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was the best predictor of positivity for prostate cancer, with mean value of 1.08 (SD 0.20) and 1.09 mm2/sec (SD 0.24) on negative biopsies and 0.81 (SD 0.22) and 0.84 mm2/sec (SD 0.22) on positive biopsies for readers 1 and 2, respectively (p < 0.001 in both analysis). For the others categorical variables evaluated the best AUC for reader 1 was subjective intensity of diffusion restriction (AUC of 0.74) and for reader 2 was hyper-enhancement (AUC of 0.65), all inferior comparing to the value of ADC map. Interobserver agreement ranged from 0.13 to 0.75, poor in most measurements, and good or excellent (kappa > 0.6) only in lesion size and ADC values.

Materials and methods:   MRI guided transrectal ultrasound and biopsy of the prostate were performed in 51 consecutive patients suspected of being at high risk for harboring prostate cancer. Core specimens were labeled with blue dye at the deep aspect and red dye at the superficial peripheral aspect of the core. The distance from the tumor to the end of the dyed specimen was measured to determine if there was an area of normal tissue between the prostate capsule and tumor.  Results:   Of the 51 patients undergoing prostate biopsy, 30 (58.8%) were found to have cancer of the prostate: grade group 1 in 13.7%, 2 in 25.5%, 3 in 7.8%, 4 in 7.8% and 5 in 3.9% of the cohort.

There was a significant increase in the level of transcription in liver, prostate, kidney, and brain cancers while a significant decrease was observed in cancers of the colon and lung. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that the mRNA levels of Tspo are higher in a normal lung cell line than in a lung cancer cell line.

For comparative assessment of prostate cryoablation results, 42 patients from Group 2 randomized in accordance with their age, stage of disease, Gleason, prostate-specific antigen, and prostate volume were selected. In compliance with the results of pre-surgical examination, all the patients had low oncological risk and were not concerned in sexual function. Volume of prostate was from 22 to 65 cm3, prostate-specific antigen level was from 4.1 to 10 ng/mL, and level of neoplastic process differentiation using Gleason grading system was from 6 to 7a (3 + 4) scores.  Results:   Patients after prostate cryoablation in early post-surgical period felt lower intensity of postoperative pain compared with those who had undergone prostatectomy.

Therefore, there is an emerging need to sensitize prostatic cancer cells to chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Modified citrus pectin (MCP) is an effective inhibitor of galectin-3 (Gal-3), which is correlated with tumor progression, proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis.  Purpose:   This study was directed to evaluate the efficacy of combining ionizing radiation (IR) with MCP on PCa cells.  Study design:   Effects of treatments on PCa cells survival were evaluated using XTT assay, flow cytometry, and clonogenic survival assay. Expression of selected proteins was estimated using western blotting. Cell motility, migration, and invasion were determined. Contribution of reactive oxygen species production to treatment effects on cell viability was tested.  Results:   Radiotherapy combined with MCP reduced viability and enhanced radiosensitivity associated with a decrease in Gal-3, cleavage of the precursor of caspase-3, increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, and downregulation of DNA repair pathways, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. MCP significantly reduced the invasive and migratory potential of PCa cells. Combining sodium pyruvate with MCP and IR mitigated the effect on cell viability.  Conclusion:   Our findings demonstrated that MCP sensitized PCa cells to IR by downregulating anti-apoptotic Gal-3, modulating DNA repair pathways, and increasing ROS production. For the first time the correlation between MCP, radiotherapy, and Gal-3 for prostatic cancer treatment was found. In addition, MCP reduced the metastatic properties of PCa cells.

With the aid of molecular and genetic profiling of cancers, cancer molecular subtypes are paving the way for tailored cancer therapy. FOXA1 has been identified as one of the seven molecular subtypes of prostate cancer. FOXA1 is involved in a variety of metabolic process such as glucose homeostasis and deregulation of its expression is crucial in prostate cancer progression. In this study, we investigated the effects of FOXA1 gene knock-out on the expression levels of various cancer cell metabolism and cell cycle-related protein expressions. FOXA1 gene was knocked-out by using CRISPR/Cas9 technique. While FOXA1 gene knock-out significantly altered Casp-9, Bax, CCND1, CDK4, and fibronectin protein expressions (P < 0.05, fold change: ∼40, 4.5, 2.5, 4.5, and 4, respectively), it did not affect the protein expression levels of Casp-3, Bcl-2, survivin, β-catenin, c-Myc, and GSK-3B. Knocking-out FOXA1 gene in androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells inhibited CCND1 protein expression. Our pre-clinical results demonstrate the importance of FOXA1 as a drug target in the treatment of prostate cancer. Impact statement Knock-out studies offer a unique way of studying the function of genes especially for developmentally lethal genes. FOXA1 has prominent roles both in breast and prostate cancer pathogenesis due to its role in ER receptor signaling pathway. FOXA1 has also been identified as one of the seven molecular subtypes of primary prostate cancer. In the present study, we used an efficient gene knock-out method, CRISPR/Cas9, in order to investigate FOXA1 function on LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro. FOXA1 knock-out altered cell-cycle regulator CCND1 protein expression levels.

Lead compounds were tested in cell and mouse cancer models.  Results:   Field template analysis of three known SK1 inhibitors, SKI-178, 12aa and SK1-I, was performed and compound screening identified six potential new SK1 inhibitors. SK1 activity assays in both cell-free and in vitro settings showed that two compounds were effective SK1 inhibitors. Compound SK-F has potently decreased cancer cell viability in vitro and sensitised mouse breast tumours to docetaxel (DTX) in vivo, without significant whole-body toxicity.  Conclusion:   Through field template screening, we have identified a new SK1 inhibitor, SK-F, which demonstrated antitumour activity in vitro and in vivo without overt toxicity when combined with DTX.""","""['Heba Alshaker', 'Shyam Srivats', 'Danielle Monteil', 'Qi Wang', 'Caroline M R Low', 'Dmitri Pchejetski']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['Everolimus (RAD001) sensitizes prostate cancer cells to docetaxel by down-regulation of HIF-1α and sphingosine kinase 1.', 'Sphingosine kinase 1 as a potential therapeutic target in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Discovery and evaluation of inhibitors of human sphingosine kinase.', 'Sphingosine kinase 1 as an anticancer therapeutic target.', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting sphingosine kinase 1 in prostate cancer.', 'Effects of adipocyte-conditioned cell culture media on S1P treatment of human triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Mitochondrial Stress in Drug-Induced Liver Injury.', 'Emerging Roles of Ceramides in Breast Cancer Biology and Therapy.', 'The Role of Sphingolipids Metabolism in Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'Therapeutic Potential of SphK1 Inhibitors Based on Abnormal Expression of SphK1 in Inflammatory Immune Related-Diseases.']"""

However, its persistent expression in castration-resistant and neuroendocrine prostate cancers implies that other transcription factors might also regulate its expression. Here, we showed that up-regulation of nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) was closely associated with the oncogenic transcription factor ERG expression in prostate cancer, and their increased coexpression patterns were closely associated with high Gleason scores and metastasis in patients. Both ERRα and ERG exhibited a positive expression correlation in a castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) xenograft model VCaP-CRPC. We showed that ERRα could directly transactivate T:E fusion gene in both AR-positive and -negative prostate cancer cells via both ERR-binding element- and AR-binding element-dependent manners. Ectopic T:E expression under ERRα regulation could promote both in vitro invasion and in vivo metastasis capacities of AR-negative prostatic cells. Intriguingly, ERG expressed by the T:E fusion could also transactivate the ERRα (ESRRA) gene. Hereby, ERRα and ERG can synergistically regulate each other and form a reciprocal regulatory loop to promote the advanced growth of prostate cancer. Inhibition of ERRα activity by ERRα inverse agonist could suppress T:E expression in prostate cancer cells, implicating that targeting ERRα could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating the aggressive T:E-positive prostate cancer.""","""['Zhenyu Xu#', 'Yuliang Wang#', 'Zhan Gang Xiao#', 'Chang Zou#', 'Xian Zhang', 'Zhu Wang', 'Dinglan Wu', 'Shan Yu', 'Franky Leung Chan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['ERG/AKR1C3/AR Constitutes a Feed-Forward Loop for AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG fusions confer efficacy of enzalutamide in an in vivo bone tumor growth model.', 'Nuclear receptor ERRα contributes to castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer via its regulation of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis.', 'Emerging biological observations in prostate cancer.', 'Covid-19 pathogenesis in prostatic cancer and TMPRSS2-ERG regulatory genetic pathway.', 'Long COVID-19 and the Heart: Is Cardiac Mitochondria the Missing Link?', 'Skeletal Muscle in Hypoxia and Inflammation: Insights on the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of 3-nitro-4-chromanone derivatives as potential antiproliferative agents for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-NO signaling axis functions to promote the growth of prostate cancer stem-like cells.', 'PGC1 alpha coactivates ERG fusion to drive antioxidant target genes under metabolic stress.']"""

At the time of surgery, most patients had relapsed after androgen-deprivation therapy, while 5 were previously untreated. An extended cohort of prostate cancer bone metastases (n = 65) was used for immunohistochemical validation.Results: On average, 5,067 proteins were identified and quantified per tumor. Compared with primary tumors (n = 26), bone metastases were more heterogeneous and showed increased levels of proteins involved in cell-cycle progression, DNA damage response, RNA processing, and fatty acid β-oxidation; and reduced levels of proteins were related to cell adhesion and carbohydrate metabolism. Within bone metastases, we identified two phenotypic subgroups: BM1, expressing higher levels of AR canonical targets, and mitochondrial and Golgi apparatus resident proteins; and BM2, with increased expression of proliferation and DNA repair-related proteins. The two subgroups, validated by the inverse correlation between MCM3 and prostate specific antigen immunoreactivity, were related to disease prognosis, suggesting that this molecular heterogeneity should be considered when developing personalized therapies.Conclusions: This work is the first system-wide quantitative characterization of the proteome of prostate cancer bone metastases and a valuable resource for understanding the etiology of prostate cancer progression.

This report demonstrates that radiation-induced changes in integrin expression can be targeted 2 months later. Integrins are transmembrane cell adhesion molecules that are essential for cancer cell survival and proliferation. To analyze the short- and long-term effects of radiation on the integrin expression, prostate cancer cells (DU145, PC3, and LNCaP) were cultured in a 3D extracellular matrix and irradiated with either a single dose of radiation (2-10 Gy) or a multifractionated regimen (2-10 fractions of 1 Gy). Whole human genome microarrays, immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation assays, and immunofluorescence staining of integrins were performed. The results were confirmed in a prostate cancer xenograft model system. Interestingly, β1 and β4 integrins (ITGB1 and ITGB4) were upregulated after radiation in vitro and in vivo. This overexpression lasted for more than 2 months and was dose dependent. Moreover, radiation-induced upregulation of β1 and β4 integrin resulted in significantly increased tumor cell death after treatment with inhibitory antibodies. Combined, these findings indicate that long-term tumor adaptation to radiation can result in an increased susceptibility of surviving cancer cells to molecular targeted therapy due to a radiation-induced overexpression of the target. IMPLICATIONS: Radiation induces dose- and schedule-dependent adaptive changes that are targetable for an extended time; thus suggesting radiotherapy as a unique strategy to orchestrate molecular processes, thereby providing new radiation-drug treatment options within precision cancer medicine.""","""['Iris Eke', 'Adeola Y Makinde', 'Molykutty J Aryankalayil', 'Jessica L Reedy', 'Deborah E Citrin', 'Sunita Chopra', 'Mansoor M Ahmed', 'C Norman Coleman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['β1 integrin- and JNK-dependent tumor growth upon hypofractionated radiation.', 'RAD9 enhances radioresistance of human prostate cancer cells through regulation of ITGB1 protein levels.', 'Suppression of ITGB4 Gene Expression in PC-3 Cells with Short Interfering RNA Induces Changes in the Expression of β-Integrins Associated with RGD-Receptors.', 'beta1 integrin targeting to enhance radiation therapy.', 'Integrin β4 as a Potential Diagnostic and Therapeutic Tumor Marker.', 'Emerging evidence for adapting radiotherapy to immunotherapy.', 'Radiotherapy alters expression of molecular targets in prostate cancer in a fractionation- and time-dependent manner.', 'Metabolic response to radiation therapy in cancer.', 'IFIT3 (interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3) modulates STAT1 expression in small extracellular vesicles.', 'Synthetic Evaluation of MicroRNA-1-3p Expression in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Based on Microarray Chips and MicroRNA Sequencing.']"""

New therapeutic targets and approaches are urgently needed. The current study reports elevated expression of R1 (CDCA7L/RAM2/JPO2), a c-Myc-interacting protein and transcription factor, in human prostate cancer tissue specimens. In a clinical cohort, high R1 expression is associated with disease recurrence and decreased patient survival. Overexpression and knockdown of R1 in human prostate cancer cells indicate that R1 induces cell proliferation and colony formation. Moreover, silencing R1 dramatically reduces the growth of prostate tumor xenografts in mice. Mechanistically, R1 increases c-Myc protein stability by inhibiting ubiquitination and proteolysis through transcriptional suppression of HUWE1, a c-Myc-targeting E3 ligase, via direct interaction with a binding element in the promoter. Moreover, transcriptional repression is supported by a negative coexpression correlation between R1 and HUWE1 in a prostate cancer clinical dataset. Collectively, these findings, for the first time, characterize the contribution of R1 to prostate cancer pathogenesis.

Most published studies investigated the diagnostic potential of 68Ga-labeled PSMA agents that are excreted renally. 18F-PSMA-1007 is a novel PSMA ligand that has excellent preclinical characteristics and that is only minimally excreted by the urinary tract, a potential advantage for pelvic imaging. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of 18F-PSMA-1007 for biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. Methods: From 3 academic centers, 251 patients with BCR after radical prostatectomy were evaluated in a retrospective analysis. Patients who had received second-line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or chemotherapy were excluded, but prior first-line ADT exposure was allowed. The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 1.2 ng/mL (range, 0.2-228 ng/mL). All patients underwent PSMA PET/CT at 92 ± 26 min after injection of 301 ± 46 MBq of 18F-PSMA-1007. The rate of detection of presumed recurrence sites was correlated with the PSA level and original primary Gleason score. A comparison to a subset of patients treated previously with ADT was undertaken. Results: Of the 251 patients, 204 (81.3%) had evidence of recurrence on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT. The detection rates were 94.0% (79/84), 90.9% (50/55), 74.5% (35/47), and 61.5% (40/65) for PSA levels of greater than or equal to 2, 1 to less than 2, 0.5 to less than 1, and 0.2 to less than 0.5 ng/mL, respectively. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT revealed local recurrence in 24.7% of patients (n = 62). Lymph node metastases were present in the pelvis in 40.6% of patients (n = 102), in the retroperitoneum in 19.5% of patients (n = 49), and in supradiaphragmatic locations in 12.0% of patients (n = 30). Bone and visceral metastases were detected in 40.2% of patients (n = 101) and in 3.6% of patients (n = 9), respectively. In tumors with higher Gleason scores (≤7 vs. ≥8), detection efficacy trended higher (76.3% vs. 86.7%) but was not statistically significant (P = 0.32). However, detection efficacy was higher in patients who had received ADT (91.7% vs. 78.0%) within 6 mo before imaging (P = 0.0179). Conclusion:18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT offers high detection rates for BCR after radical prostatectomy that are comparable to or better than those published for 68Ga-labeled PSMA ligands.""","""['Frederik L Giesel', 'Karina Knorr', 'Fabian Spohn', 'Leon Will', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Paul Flechsig', 'Oliver Neels', 'Kilian Schiller', 'Horacio Amaral', 'Wolfgang A Weber', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Clemens Kratochwil', 'Peter Choyke', 'Vasko Kramer', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Matthias Eiber']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for the Detection of Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', '68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The Diagnostic Performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Early Recurrence after Definitive Therapy with a PSA <10 ng/ml.', 'Prognostic utility of RECIP 1.0 with manual and AI-based segmentations in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer from 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET images.', 'The Application of Radiolabeled Targeted Molecular Probes for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'The prognostic value of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in predicting pathological upgrading of newly diagnosed prostate cancer from systematic biopsy to radical prostatectomy.', 'Detection efficacy of\xa089ZrZr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in\xa068GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT-negative biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'PET/CT imaging 2\xa0h after injection of 18FPSMA-1007 can lead to higher staging of prostate cancer than imaging after 1\xa0h.']"""

We present a technical modification for RARP which preserves the nerves and vascular structures anterior to the prostate aiming to optimize functional outcomes.  Objective:   To present oncological and functional results of a modified technique for RARP.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective, noncontrolled case series including 128 consecutive patients undergoing RARP performed by a single surgeon (R.F.C).  Surgical procedure:   RARP with retrograde release of the neurovascular bundle and preservation of dorsal venous complex.  Measurements:   Potency was defined as a Sexual Health Inventory for Men score of ≥17; continence was defined as use of no pads. Oncological results analyzed were positive surgical margins (PSM) rates and biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival. BCR was defined as prostate-specific antigen >0.2ng/ml. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Results and limitations:   Median patient age was 63.5 yr. Median skin-to-skin time was 78min. Median length of hospital stay was 1 d, with seven patients (5.5%) hospitalized for more than 24h. Median intraoperative bleeding was 200ml and two patients required postoperative blood transfusion (1.6%). Four patients (3.1%) had grade ≥3 complications. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) occurred in nine of 128 patients (7%) and median time to BCR was 6 mo. Overall PSM rate was 13.3% (17 of 128 patients). PSM rate was 9% among patients with pT2 disease (8/89) and 27% in patients with pT3 (9/38). Continence was reached immediately in 85.9% of the patients and 98.4% were continent at1 yr. At 1 mo postoperatively, 60 patients were potent (53%), while 98 patients among 113 (86%) were potent 1 yr after surgery. A limitation of this study is that it was a noncomparative study.  Conclusions:   Retrograde release of the neurovascular bundle with preservation of dorsal venous complex during RARP is safe and associated with excellent oncological and functional outcomes. Future comparative studies are needed.

The summary RR and 95%CI of the highest protein intake compared to those with the lowest protein intake on prostate cancer risk were 0.993 (95%CI = 0.930-1.061), with no between-study heterogeneity found (I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.656). Moreover, the association was not significant on prostate cancer risk with animal protein intake [RR = 1.001, 95%CI = 0.917-1.092] or vegetable protein intake [RR = 0.986, 95%CI = 0.904-1.076]. The results were not changed when we conducted subgroup analysis by study design, cancer type, or geographic locations. We did not detect any publication bias using Egger's test (P = 0.296) and funnel plot.

Materials and methods:   MUL was prospectively measured in 18 male volunteers using MRI and on two separate occasions in two different patient positions using TPUS; the patient supine with the knees extended (Supine) and supine with the knees flexed to 70 degrees (Supine KF). Agreement between TPUS and MRI measurements of MUL was assessed using Bland-Altman method comparison techniques and a two-way mixed-effects single measures intraclass correlation (ICC). Test-retest reliability was assessed using a two-way random effects single measures ICC.  Results:   The mean difference in MUL measurements between MRI and i) TPUS Supine was -0.8 mm (95% limits of agreement (LOA): -3.2, 1.7) and ii) TPUS Supine KF was -0.8mm (95% LOA: -3.5, 1.9). ICC indicated a point estimate of excellent agreement between MRI and TPUS Supine ICC 0.93 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.98) and TPUS Supine KF ICC 0.91 (95%CI 0.79, 0.97).

Methods: Cancer incidence data from volume XI of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents including 339 population-based cancer registries in 65 countries during 2008-2012 have been extracted. The average age of cancer incidence in different regions, gender and cancer sites were analyzed and stratified according to the human development Index and the level of national or regional development UN Development. The Segi's world standard population (world standard) was standardized to calculate the average age of the cancer incidence and to analyze the effect of age structure of the population on the average age of cancer diagnosis. Results: This study included 4 812 008 148 person-years in the global population (including 2 367 458 302 men and 2 444 549 846 women), and 21 892 093 of the new cancer cases, including 11 450 515 men and 10 441 578 women. The analysis showed that the average age of cancer incidence in the world was 65.73 years, and men and women were 66.70 and 64.67 years old, respectively. Among them, the average incidence age of testicular cancer was the youngest, with an average age of 36.67 years, and that of gallbladder cancer was the highest with average age of 71.55 years. After adjusting for population structure, the average incidence age was highest in gallbladder cancer, followed with bladder cancer and prostate cancer, and the testicular was with the lowest average age of incidence, followed by bone cancer and brain tumor. The results showed that the average age of cancer incidence in developed countries or regions was 66.38 years old, and that in less developed countries or regions was 61.75 years old, but in China it was 63.47 years old. According to the human development index (HDI), the higher the country or region with HDI, the higher the average age of cancer incidence, and the difference is reduced after the adjustment of the age structure of the population. Conclusions: There are different characteristics of the age distribution for different cancer sites. In terms of the age of cancer incidence, those of gallbladder cancer and bladder cancer are relatively old, while those of the testis, bone and thyroid cancer are relatively young. The average age of cancer incidence in China is between developed and less developed countries.

Methods:   Urine samples from PCa survivors with a history of external beam radiation therapy were tested for a panel of angiogenic growth factors by Luminex assay. Urine creatinine levels were measured through high performance liquid chromatography. Through a patient survey, data on patient demographics, radiation history, and urinary symptoms were collected.  Results:   Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were altered in urine of PCa survivors with a history of radiation therapy. HGF and PlGF were elevated in response to irradiation, while VEGF had a decreasing trend. Within the irradiated population, HGF was also increased in patients diagnosed with radiation cystitis and patients with hematuria. PlGF and VEGF were only increased in the first year postirradiation, and VEGF was elevated in patients with hematuria. Finally, creatinine levels were increased in PCa survivors with a history of radiation therapy.

After prostate cancer treatment men often experience erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence. Dual prosthetic implantation can improve the quality of life of these men. We evaluated reoperation outcomes in men who underwent dual implantation compared to each device implanted individually.  Materials and methods:   We queried the SPARCS (New York State Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative) database for men who underwent inflatable penile prosthesis and/or artificial urinary sphincter insertion between 2000 and 2014. The primary outcomes were the inflatable penile prosthesis and artificial urinary sphincter reoperation rates (revision, replacement or removal). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess the association of dual implantation with reoperation. Adjusted time to event analysis was also performed.  Results:   Median followup in the inflatable penile prosthesis cohort was 66 months (IQR 25-118) and in the artificial urinary sphincter cohort it was 69 months (IQR 27-121). Compared with men who received a penile prosthesis alone those with a penile prosthesis and an artificial urinary sphincter had a higher likelihood of undergoing inflatable penile prosthesis reoperation at 1 year (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.32-3.27, p <0.01) and 3 years (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.69-3.99, p <0.01). Compared with an artificial urinary sphincter alone patients with an inflatable penile prosthesis and an artificial urinary sphincter did not have a higher likelihood of undergoing artificial urinary sphincter reoperation at 1 year (p = 0.76) or 3 years (p = 0.73).  Conclusions:   Combined inflatable penile prosthesis and artificial urinary sphincter insertion portends a higher likelihood of inflatable penile prosthesis reoperation at 1 and 3 years. However, artificial urinary sphincter outcomes remain comparable. These findings should be used to better counsel patients about the risk of reoperation when undergoing dual implantation.""","""['Neal Patel', 'Ron Golan', 'Joshua A Halpern', 'Tianyi Sun', 'Abena Denise Asafu-Adjei', 'Bilal Chughtai', 'Peter Stahl', 'Art Sedrakyan', 'James A Kashanian']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment: A Contemporary Analysis of Dual Inflatable Penile Prosthesis and Artificial Urinary Sphincter Outcomes.', 'Combined inflatable penile prosthesis-artificial urinary sphincter implantation: no increased risk of adverse events compared to single or staged device implantation.', 'Artificial Urinary Sphincter Considerations in Men With Prior Inflatable Penile Prosthesis Placement.', 'Trends in Penile Prosthetics: Influence of Patient Demographics, Surgeon Volume, and Hospital Volume on Type of Penile Prosthesis Inserted in New York State.', 'Synchronous Surgical Management of Erectile Dysfunction and Stress Urinary Incontinence: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Reoperation Rates.', 'Fundamentals of prosthetic urology.', 'Climacturia: what treatment options do we offer to those with and without concomitant erectile dysfunction?', 'The International Penile Prosthesis Implant Consensus Forum: clinical recommendations and surgical principles on the inflatable 3-piece penile prosthesis implant.', 'Artificial Urinary Sphincter Complications: Risk Factors, Workup, and Clinical Approach.', 'Penile prosthesis implant in the special populations: diabetics, neurogenic conditions, fibrotic cases, concurrent urinary continence surgery, and salvage implants.', 'Artificial urinary sphincter surgery in the special populations: neurological, revision, concurrent penile prosthesis and female stress urinary incontinence groups.']"""

The objective of this project was to compare the impact of initial radical prostatectomy vs radiation therapy on survival outcomes in young men less than 60 years old with high grade prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of men younger than 60 years in the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) database who underwent initial surgery or radiation therapy of high grade (Gleason score 8 or greater) localized (N0M0 TNM stage) prostate cancer from 2004 to 2012.

Our aim was to provide accurate population-based estimates of the health services cost of cancer care using large-scale linked patient-level data.  Methods:   We analysed data for incident cancers diagnosed 2006-2010 and followed to 2014 among 266,793 eligible participants in the 45 and Up Study. Health system costs included Medicare and pharmaceutical claims, inpatient hospital episodes and emergency department presentations. Costs for cancer cases and matched cancer-free controls were compared, to estimate monthly/annual excess costs of cancer care by cancer type, before and after diagnosis and by phase of care (initial, continuing, terminal). Total costs incurred in 2013 were also estimated for all people diagnosed in Australia 2009-2013.  Results:   7624 participants diagnosed with cancer were matched with up to three controls. The mean excess cost of care per case was AUD$1,622 for the year before diagnosis, $33,944 for the first year post-diagnosis and $8,796 for the second year post-diagnosis, with considerable variation by cancer type. Mean annual cost after the initial treatment phase was $4,474/case and the mean cost for the last year of life was $49,733/case. In 2013 the cost for cancers among people in Australia diagnosed during 2009-2013 was ~$6.3billion (0.4% of Gross Domestic Product; $272 per capita), with the largest costs for colorectal cancer ($1.1billion), breast cancer ($0.8billion), lung cancer ($0.6billion) and prostate cancer ($0.5billion).

Patients and methods:   The expression of lncRNA LINP1 in 74 pairs of PCa and normal tissues were detected by quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR); the relationship between its expression and the pathological features and prognosis of PCa was also analyzed. The expression of lncRNA LINP1 in the PCa cell line was verified by qRT-PCR. Knockdown of LINP1 was constructed by transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) in two PCa cell lines (Lncap and PC-3). The biological function of LINP1 was evaluated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, migration and invasion assay, respectively. Finally, the potential mechanism of LINP1 was explored by Western blot and qRT-PCR.  Results:   qRT-PCR results showed a higher expression of LINP1 in PCa than that of normal tissues. Compared with PCa patients with a lower expression of LINP1, those with higher expression had a higher tumor stage, lymphatic metastasis and distant metastasis rate, and lower overall survival rate. Proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cells transfected with si-LINP1 were remarkably decreased than those transfected with negative control (si-NC). Moreover, the expressions of the key proteins in the p53 signaling pathway, including p53, PTEN, Akt and CDK2 were remarkably decreased in cells after knockdown of LINP1. In addition, a negative correlation between LINP1 and p53 was confirmed by rescue experiments.  Conclusions:   Up-regulated LINP1 in PCa was correlated with a higher PCa stage, lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, and worse prognosis.

This study aims to investigate the function of CA916798 in the growth and metastasis of androgen-dependent PCa cells.  Materials and methods:   CA916798 expression in PCa cell lines was investigated. LNCap cells were divided into 4 groups: LNCap, LNCap+ Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), LNCap+DHT+siCA916798, and LNCap+DHT+siRA group. CA916798 expressions in LNCap cells treated with siCA917698 or siAR were examined. The viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of PCa cells were examined. Dual luciferase and ChIP assays were used to examine the interaction between the AR and CA916798.  Results:   Endogenous CA916798 mRNA levels in PC3 cells were significantly higher than those in LNCap cells (p < 0.05). However, CA916798 was androgen-sensitive in LNCap cells, but not in PC-3 cells. Dual luciferase and ChIP assays showed that AR could specifically bind to the promoter regions of the CA916798. Knockdown of CA916798 (LNCap+DHT+siCA916798) and AR (LNCap+DHT+siAR) resulted in decreased cell viability, migration, and invasion, while it induced apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest in LNCap cells.

The purpose of this study is twofold: 1) To accelerate the luminal water imaging acquisition by using inner volume selection as part of a gradient and spin echo sequence, and 2) to evaluate the accuracy of luminal water fractions and multicomponent T2 relaxation times.  Methods:   The accuracy of parameter estimates was assessed using Monte Carlo simulations, in phantom experiments and in the prostate (in 5 healthy subjects). Two fitting methods, nonnegative least squares and biexponential fitting with stimulated echo correction, were compared.  Results:   Results demonstrate that inner volume selection in a gradient and spin echo sequence is effective for accelerating prostate luminal water imaging by at least threefold. Evaluation of the accuracy shows that the estimated luminal water fractions are relatively accurate, but the short- and long-T2 relaxation times should be interpreted with caution in noisy scenarios (SNR < 100) and when the corresponding fractions are small ( < 0.5). The mean luminal water fractions obtained at SNR above 100 are 0.27 ± 0.07 for the peripheral zone for both fitting methods, 0.16 ± 0.04 for the transition zone with nonnegative least squares, and 0.16 ± 0.03 for the transition zone with biexponential fitting including stimulated echo correction.  Conclusion:   The shortened scan duration allows the luminal water imaging sequence to be easily integrated into a standard multiparametric prostate MRI protocol.""","""['Rachel W Chan', 'Angus Z Lau', 'Garry Detzler', 'Vivekanandan Thayalasuthan', 'Robert K Nam', 'Masoom A Haider']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Magn Reson Med""","""['New prostate MRI techniques and sequences.', 'Accelerated 3D T2 mapping with dictionary-based matching for prostate imaging.', 'Probing structure of normal and malignant prostate tissue before and after radiation therapy with luminal water fraction and diffusion-weighted MRI.', 'Measuring water content using T2 relaxation at 3T: Phantom validations and simulations.', 'MR measurement of luminal water in prostate gland: Quantitative correlation between MRI and histology.', 'Joint estimation of relaxation and diffusion tissue parameters for prostate cancer with relaxation-VERDICT MRI.', 'Validation of Prostate Tissue Composition by Using Hybrid Multidimensional MRI: Correlation with Histologic Findings.', 'New prostate MRI techniques and sequences.']"""

Tumor hypoxia is a major factor that induces malignant progression, but most previous studies on tumor hypoxia were performed under short-term hypoxia for up to 72 hours and few studies have focused on tumor response to chronic hypoxic conditions. Here we show a molecular mechanism by which chronic hypoxia promotes invasive behavior in prostate cancer cells. We found that an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-driving transcription factor, slug, is specifically upregulated under chronic hypoxia and promotes tumor cell migration and invasion. Unexpectedly, processes associated with EMT, such as loss of E-cadherin, are not observed under chronic hypoxia. Instead, expression of ephrin-B1, a ligand of Eph-related receptor tyrosine kinases, is markedly induced by slug through E-box motifs and promotes cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, slug and ephrin-B1 are highly coexpressed in chronic hypoxic cells of human prostate adenocarcinoma tissues after androgen deprivation, which is known to cause tumor hypoxia. Taken together, these results indicate that chronic hypoxia-induced slug promotes invasive behavior of prostate cancer cells by activating the expression of ephrin-B1. In addition, ephrin-B1 may be a novel therapeutic target in combination with androgen deprivation therapy for aggressive prostate cancer.""","""['Kazunori Iwasaki', 'Ryo Ninomiya', 'Toshitaka Shin', 'Takeo Nomura', 'Tooru Kajiwara', 'Naoki Hijiya', 'Masatsugu Moriyama', 'Hiromitsu Mimata', 'Fumihiko Hamada']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['CX3CL1 increases invasiveness and metastasis by promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through the TACE/TGF-α/EGFR pathway in hypoxic androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Over-expression of lipocalin 2 promotes cell migration and invasion through activating ERK signaling to increase SLUG expression in prostate cancer.', 'Skp2 and Slug Are Coexpressed in Aggressive Prostate Cancer and Inhibited by Neddylation Blockade.', 'Cell death under epithelial-mesenchymal transition control in prostate cancer therapeutic response.', 'The role of Snail in prostate cancer.', 'A comprehensive prognostic and immunological analysis of ephrin family genes in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Telomere Lengths and Serum Proteasome Concentrations in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes and Different Severities of Diabetic Retinopathy in Latvia and Lithuania.', 'Construction of three-gene-based prognostic signature and analysis of immune cells infiltration in children and young adults with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia.', 'Ephrin B Activate Src Family Kinases in Fibroblasts Inducing Stromal Remodeling in Prostate Cancer.', 'LW1497, an Inhibitor of Malate Dehydrogenase, Suppresses TGF-β1-Induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Lung Cancer Cells by Downregulating Slug.']"""

Material and methods:   The records of all patients that underwent radical prostatectomy at our hospital between 2007 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The study parameters included patient demographics, the percentage of pre-operative prostate biopsies positive for PCa, biopsy Gleason Score (GS), and pre- and post-operative PSA values.  Result:   The study included 146 patients with complete medical records and follow-up data. Mean age of the patientswas 66.6 ± 6.08 years. According to the newly proposed Gleason grading system, 97 (66.4%) patients were grade 1, 20 (13.7%) were grade 2, 8 (5.5%) were grade 3, 11 (7.5%) were grade 4, and 10 (6.8%) were grade 5. The distribution of CAPRA scores was as follows: 1: n = 43 (29.5%); 2: n = 53 (36.3%); 3: n = 22 (15.1%); 4: n = 14 (9.6%); 5: n = 8 (5.5%); 6: n = 4 (2.7%); 7: n = 1 (0.7%); 8: n = 1 (0.7%). Correlation analysis showed that theCAPRA score was significantly correlated with GS based on the newly proposed Gleason grading system (CorrelationCoefficient=0.361, P < 0.001).

Methods:   Men ≤ 60 years at diagnosis who completed the Life After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis (LAPCD) survey were identified. Men who moved from employment at diagnosis to unemployment (EtoU) or retirement (EtoR) at survey (18-42 months post-diagnosis) were compared to men remaining in employment (EtoE). Sociodemographic, clinical and patient-reported factors were analysed in univariable and multivariable analysis.  Results:   There were 3218 men (81.4%) in the EtoE, 245 (6.2%) in EtoU and 450 (11.4%) in the EtoR groups. Men with stage IV disease (OR = 4.7 95% CI 3.1-7.0, relative to stage I/II) and reporting moderate/big bowel (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.6-3.9) or urinary problems (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-3.0) had greater odds of becoming unemployed.

Increasing evidence suggests that flutamide-induced liver injury is associated with oxidative stress, though the precise mechanism is poorly understood. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master transcription factor regulating endogenous antioxidants including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). This study was designed to delineate the role of Nrf2/HO-1 in flutamide-induced hepatic cell injury. Our results showed that flutamide concentration dependently induced cytotoxicity, hydrogen peroxide accumulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction as indicated by mitochondrial membrane potential loss and ATP depletion. The protein expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 was induced by flutamide at 12.5 μM but was downregulated by higher concentrations of flutamide. Silencing either Nrf2 or HO-1 was found to aggravate flutamide-induced hydrogen peroxide accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction as well as inhibition of the Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, preinduction of HO-1 by Copp significantly attenuated flutamide-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, while inhibition of HO-1 by Snpp aggravated these deleterious effects. These findings suggest that flutamide-induced hepatic cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction is assoicated with inhibition of Nrf2-mediated HO-1.

This investigation aimed to determine the serum IL-35 concentrations and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in position of rs3761548, within the promoter region of FOXP3 gene, in patients with prostate cancer (PC). The blood specimens were obtained from 150 PC patients prior to using radiation therapy, chemo- or immunotherapy and 150 age-matched healthy men as a control group. The serum IL-35 concentrations and the pattern of genetic variation at position of rs3761548 were assessed using ELISA and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), respectively. The mean serum IL-35 concentrations were significantly higher in PC patients when compared with healthy control group (20.01 ± 7.03 Pg/mL vs. 11.60 ± 2.49 Pg/mL, P < 0.001). The serum IL-35 concentrations raised with progression of PC stages so that there was a significant difference between PC stages concerning the IL-35 concentrations (P < 0.001). The mean serum IL-35 concentrations in patients with Gleason scores of 1-6 and Gleason scores 7-10 were significantly higher as compared with healthy controls (P < 0.001). Moreover, the serum IL-35 concentrations in patients with having Gleason scores of 7-10 were significantly higher as compared with patients with Gleason scores of 1-6 (P < 0.001). Evaluation of the genetic variations in position SNP rs3761548 revealed that the AA genotype and A allele were more prevalent whereas CC genotype and C allele were less prevalent in PC patients when compared with healthy men (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, P < 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively). The AA genotype and A allele were associated with higher risk of PC incidence [OR: 2.42 (95% CI: 1.179-4.99); P < 0.001 and OR: 1.732 (95% CI: 1.244 - 2.413); P < 0.001, respectively]. The mean serum IL-35 concentrations were significantly higher in total subjects (PC patients + healthy individuals) with AA genotype and A allele than individuals with CC genotype and C allele at SNP rs3761548 (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Higher serum IL-35 concentrations observed in patients with PC that were increased with progressive tumor stages. These findings indicate that the IL-35 is possibly involve in tumor progression.

Prior data have suggested that brachytherapy tends to be focused at high-volume centers. Medicare reimbursement data can provide an understanding of the distribution of brachytherapy cases among billing providers. The objective of this study is to quantify the distribution of brachytherapy cases and high volume providers.  Methods and materials:   The Medicare Physician and Other Supplier Public Use File was queried for individual physicians who had performed brachytherapy for more than 10 patients with gynecologic or prostate cancer in the years 2012-2015. Aggregate data were also queried. Trends were identified, and basic summary statistics were tabulated.  Results:   During the study period, there was an increase in vaginal brachytherapy (3328 unique cases in 2012-4308 in 2015) but a decrease in intrauterine implants, such as tandem placements (1522 in 2012-1307 in 2015) and prostate brachytherapy (8860 in 2012-6527 in 2015). High-volume providers treating more than 10 patients represented a disproportionate number of patients treated, particularly with intra-uterine brachytherapy, representing no more than 1.2% of the active providers in a given year but up to 11.1% of intra-uterine brachytherapy cases.  Conclusions:   Among Medicare claims, a small number of providers accounted for a significant proportion of gynecologic and prostate brachytherapy cases, particularly in the case of intrauterine implants. The vast majority of brachytherapy providers perform limited cases in this population.

We examine peer support use across three major modalities (i.e. support groups, online platforms, one-on-one) and identify enablers and barriers to peer support using the beliefs framework of the theory of planned behaviour. A population-based sample of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 3105) who were on average 54.08 weeks since diagnosis completed mailed surveys at baseline measuring beliefs about peer support and intention. Peer support use was measured via telephone interview at baseline and prospectively at 12-month follow-up (n = 2780). In all, 37% of women had used at least one peer support service since diagnosis (support group = 20%, online = 18%, one-on-one = 10%). A path analysis examined what beliefs enabled or acted as barriers to peer support use at follow-up adjusting for past behaviour (i.e. baseline use), sociodemographic characteristics, and treatment. In order of relative strength, enablers included beliefs that peer support is an outlet for honest expression of feelings (β = .35), a source of empathy (β = .30), approved by doctors (β = .07), and approved by family/partner (β = .04). Barriers were beliefs that it encourages dwelling about breast cancer (β = - .06) and involves exposure to negative stories about this disease (β = - .04). Strategies which communicate the potential emotional support benefits of a shared illness experience and social approval by others, particularly the medical profession, may help to promote acceptance of peer support and encourage service uptake in breast cancer.""","""['Melissa Legg', 'Melissa K Hyde', 'Stefano Occhipinti', 'Philippa H Youl', 'Jeff Dunn', 'Suzanne K Chambers']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['The psychosocial experiences of women with breast cancer across the lifespan: a systematic review protocol.', 'The use and acceptability of a one-on-one peer support program for Australian women with early breast cancer.', 'Senior peer counseling by telephone for psychosocial support after breast cancer surgery: effects at six months.', 'Effectiveness of peer support on health-related quality of life in recently diagnosed breast cancer patients: a randomized controlled trial.', 'Creating a Supportive Environment: Peer Support Groups for Psychotic Disorders.', 'Sexuality, fertility, family planning, family life, and partnership in young breast cancer patients: a longitudinal study.', 'The role of social networks in the self-management support for\xa0young women recently diagnosed with breast cancer.', ""Expanding access to cancer peer support: development of a website to deliver written peer support that meets patients' individual emotional and informational needs while reducing potential harms."", 'Moving through adulthood: The lived experience of Irish adults with PKU.', 'Self-help friendliness in cancer care: A cross-sectional study among self-help group leaders in Germany.']"""

However, there are no standard dosimetric guidelines, and normal tissue tolerances for extreme hypofractionation are not well defined. We analyzed dosimetric correlations with patient-reported urinary and bowel quality of life (QOL) on a prospective trial.  Methods and materials:   Patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer from 18 institutions were enrolled on a phase 2 trial from 2007 to 2012 and treated using robotic SBRT to 38 Gy in 4 fractions on consecutive days. No androgen deprivation was used. Patients received simulation with Foley catheter for urethral delineation. The clinical target volume was prostate (low-risk patients) or prostate plus 1 cm of proximal seminal vesicles (intermediate-risk patients). Multiple dosimetric measures for urethra, bladder, and rectum were prospectively recorded. QOL using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite was assessed before and after treatment at protocol-specific time points. Linear regression was used to assess factors associated with QOL at 1 month and 2 years.  Results:   A total of 259 patients were enrolled. QOL data were available for 98%, 96%, and 84% at baseline, 1 month, and 2 years, respectively. Median age was 69 years. Prior transurethral resection of the prostate and clinical target volume size were associated with 2-year urinary incontinence. There was a trend toward worse 2-year obstruction/irritation in older patients on multivariable analysis. Bladder and urethral doses were not associated with either 1-month or 2-year urinary QOL. In contrast, rectum maximum dose was associated with both 1-month and 2-year bowel QOL. At 2 years, the proportion with moderate or big overall bowel problems (as defined by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26) was significantly higher in patients with rectum maximum dose greater than versus less than the median 37.4 Gy (11% vs 2%, Fisher's exact test P = .008).

Methods:   Total RNA was extracted from 212 prostatic tissue samples (101 BPH and 111 CaP) and, following cDNA synthesis, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed for the expressional quantification of RNase κ. Extensive statistical analysis, including bootstrap resampling, was performed to investigate the differential expression of RNase κ in patients with BPH and CaP and its associations with patients' clinicopathological and survival data.  Results:   RNase κ was significantly downregulated (P = 0.002) in CaP patients compared to BPH ones. RNase κ overexpression was associated with decreased risk of CaP development and can discriminate between CaP and BPH independently of serum PSA levels (crude odds ratio = 0.93, P = 0.001). RNase κ upregulation was also associated with less advanced (P = 0.018) and less aggressive (P = 0.001) tumors as well as with longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.003).

Methods:   A cohort of 420 patients was enrolled and 253 patients were rolled out, due to exclusion criteria. 167 patients, underwent diagnostic 3T MpMRI. Two expert radiologists evaluated the exams adopting PI-RADSv2 and CAD system. When a CAD target overlapped with a radiologic one, we performed the biopsy in the overlapping area which we defined as target-in-target. Targeted TRUS-MRI fusion biopsy was performed in 63 patients with a total of 212 targets. The MRI data of all targets were quantitatively analyzed, and diagnostic findings were compared to pathologist's biopsy reports.  Results:   CAD system diagnostic performance exhibited sensitivity and specificity scores of 55.2% and 74.1% [AUC = 0.63 (0.54 ÷ 0.71)] , respectively. Human readers achieved an AUC value, in ROC analysis, of 0.71 (0.63 ÷ 0.79). The target-in-target method provided a detection rate per targeted biopsy core of 81.8 % vs. a detection rate per targeted biopsy core of 68.6 % for pure PI-RADS based on target definitions. The higher per-core detection rate of the target-in-target approach was achieved irrespective of the presence of technical flaws and artifacts.  Conclusions:   A novel consensus method combining human reader evaluation with automated CAD system analysis of mpMRI to define prostate biopsy targets was shown to improve the detection rate per biopsy core of TRUS-MRI fusion biopsies.

This technique has translated to the clinic with initial studies in prostate cancer. Here, we use the technique to investigate its potential uses in patients with glioblastoma (GB). We assessed the metabolism of hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate in an orthotopically implanted cell line model (U87) of GB and in patient-derived tumors, where these were produced by orthotopic implantation of cells derived from different patients. Lactate labeling was higher in the U87 tumor when compared with patient-derived tumors, which displayed intertumoral heterogeneity, reflecting the intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity in the patients' tumors from which they were derived. Labeling in some patient-derived tumors could be observed before their appearance in morphologic images, whereas in other tumors it was not significantly greater than the surrounding brain. Increased lactate labeling in tumors correlated with c-Myc-driven expression of hexokinase 2, lactate dehydrogenase A, and the monocarboxylate transporters and was accompanied by increased radioresistance. Because c-Myc expression correlates with glioma grade, this study demonstrates that imaging with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate could be used clinically with patients with GB to determine disease prognosis, to detect early responses to drugs that modulate c-Myc expression, and to select tumors, and regions of tumors for increased radiotherapy dose.Significance: Metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate detects low levels of c-Myc-driven glycolysis in patient-derived glioblastoma models, which, when translated to the clinic, could be used to detect occult disease, determine disease prognosis, and target radiotherapy.

Two mAbs, ipilimumab (IgG1) and tremelimumab (IgG2), which block the function of CTLA-4, have demonstrated durable clinical activity in a subset of patients with advanced solid malignancies by augmenting effector T-cell-mediated immune responses. Studies in mice suggest that anti-CTLA-4 mAbs may also selectively deplete intratumoral FOXP3+ regulatory T cells via an Fc-dependent mechanism. However, it is unclear whether the depletion of FOXP3+ cells occurs in patients with cancer treated with anti-CTLA-4 therapies.  Experimental design:   Quantitative IHC was used to evaluate the densities of intratumoral CD4+, CD8+, and FOXP3+ cells in stage-matched melanoma (n = 19), prostate cancer (n = 17), and bladder cancer (n = 9) samples treated with ipilimumab and in paired melanoma tumors (n = 18) treated with tremelimumab.

Results:   Both ipilimumab and tremelimumab increase infiltration of intratumoral CD4+ and CD8+ cells without significantly changing or depleting FOXP3+ cells within the tumor microenvironment.  Conclusions:   Anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy does not deplete FOXP3+ cells in human tumors, which suggests that their efficacy could be enhanced by modifying the Fc portions of the mAbs to enhance Fc-mediated depletion of intratumoral regulatory T cells.See related commentary by Quezada and Peggs, p. 1130.""","""['Anu Sharma#', 'Sumit K Subudhi#', 'Jorge Blando', 'Jorge Scutti', 'Luis Vence', 'Jennifer Wargo', 'James P Allison', 'Antoni Ribas', 'Padmanee Sharma']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Lost in Translation: Deciphering the Mechanism of Action of Anti-human CTLA-4.', 'Anti-CTLA-4 Immunotherapy Does Not Deplete FOXP3+ Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) in Human Cancers-Letter.', 'Anti-CTLA-4 Immunotherapy Does Not Deplete FOXP3+ Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) in Human Cancers-Response.', 'Response to ipilimumab therapy in metastatic melanoma patients: potential relevance of CTLA-4+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and their in situ localization.', 'A reappraisal of CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy.', 'Anti-CTLA-4 Activates Intratumoral NK Cells and Combined with IL15/IL15Rα Complexes Enhances Tumor Control.', 'Clinical experience with CTLA-4 blockade for cancer immunotherapy: From the monospecific monoclonal antibody ipilimumab to probodies and bispecific molecules targeting the tumor microenvironment.', 'A Systematic Review of Immunotherapy in Urologic Cancer: Evolving Roles for Targeting of CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1, and HLA-G.', 'Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced Colitis: From Pathogenesis to Management.', 'Both intratumoral regulatory T cell depletion and CTLA-4 antagonism are required for maximum efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies.', 'Reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment results in successful clearance of tumors resistant to radiation therapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1.', 'Construction of T cell exhaustion model for predicting survival and immunotherapy effect of bladder cancer based on WGCNA.', 'Autoimmunity and Carcinogenesis: Their Relationship under the Umbrella of Autophagy.']"""

A Matched-pair Comparative Analysis of the Cryo On-Line Data Registry""","""Background:   African-American (AA) men have the greatest incidence of and disease-specific mortality from prostate cancer of any racial group. Although encouraging oncologic and functional outcomes have been reported with prostate cancer cryotherapy, little is known about how ethnicity can potentially affect the oncologic outcomes of primary cryotherapy. We report the oncologic outcomes of primary cryotherapy in AA patients through a matched-pair analysis.  Patients and methods:   A 1:2 (AA to non-AA) cohort of patients was designed using the Cryo-On-Line Data Registry. The 2 arms were matched for patient age, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, and prostate volume. The oncologic outcome was defined in terms of the biochemical recurrence (BCR) rates after primary cryoablation using Phoenix criteria. The results of ""for-cause"" post-treatment biopsies and the BCR-free survival rates were also analyzed between the 2 groups.  Results:   The 1:2 cohort of AA and non-AA men in the present study included 109 and 218 men, respectively. Their median age (69 vs. 71 years; P = .71), median prostate-specific antigen level (6.5 vs. 6.8 ng/mL; P = .95), median prostate volume (32 vs. 30 cm3; P = .31), Gleason score distribution (P = .97), and prostate cancer risk group (P = .12) were similar statistically. The median postoperative follow-up period was also comparable between the 2 groups (AA, 32 months vs. non-AA, 27 months; P = .52). The BCR rates were similar between the AA and non-AA men (14% vs. 17%; P = .52). Likewise, the rate of positive ""for-cause"" prostate biopsy findings was similar between the 2 groups (AA vs. non-AA, 25% vs. 36%; P = .44). Furthermore, the 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival rates were comparable for the AA and non-AA patients (74% vs. 71%; P = .37).

The present study aims to investigate the function and the related mechanism by which HZ08 sensitizes radiotherapeutic efficiency to treat aggressive PCa cells.  Methods:   PCa cells were pretreated with HZ08 (6,7-dimethoxy-1-(3,4-dimethoxy) benzyl-2-(N-n-octyl-N'-cyano) guanyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline) and followed by ionizing radiation (IR) treatment. Cytotoxicity in the treated cells was analyzed to assess the radiosensitization capacity of HZ08 by flow cytometry, MTT and colony survival assays. The cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxygen consumption rates (OCR) were measured using specific ROS detection probes and a Seahorse XF96 Analyzer, respectively. RelB binding to the NF-κB intronic enhancer region of the human SOD2 gene was determined using a ChIP assay. The levels of phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt and IKKα were quantified and further confirmed using a PI3K inhibitor. Finally, the synergistic effect of HZ08 on radiosensitization of PCa cells was validated using a mouse xenograft tumor model.  Results:   HZ08 enhanced radiosensitivity of PCa cells through increasing ROS and declining mitochondrial respiration due to suppression of mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme MnSOD. Mechanistically, HZ08 appeared to inhibit PI3K/Akt/IKKα signaling axis, resulting in transcriptional repression of MnSOD expression by preventing RelB nuclear translocation.  Conclusions:   HZ08 can serve as a useful radiosensitizing agent to improve radiotherapy for treating aggressive PCa cells with high level of constitutive RelB. The present study suggests a promising approach for enhancing radiotherapeutic efficiency to treat advanced PCa by inhibiting antioxidant defense function.""","""['Yanyan Zhang', 'Zhi Xu', 'Jiaji Ding', 'Chunli Tan', 'Weizi Hu', 'Yunman Li', 'Wenlong Huang', 'Yong Xu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['RelB Expression Determines the Differential Effects of Ascorbic Acid in Normal and Cancer Cells.', 'RelB-dependent differential radiosensitization effect of STI571 on prostate cancer cells.', 'The RelB-BLNK Axis Determines Cellular Response to a Novel Redox-Active Agent Betamethasone during Radiation Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'RelB regulates manganese superoxide dismutase gene and resistance to ionizing radiation of prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in the treatment of prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'Stromal cell-derived small extracellular vesicles enhance radioresistance of prostate cancer cells via interleukin-8-induced autophagy.', 'Insights into Manganese Superoxide Dismutase and Human Diseases.', 'RelB upregulates PD-L1 and exacerbates prostate cancer immune evasion.', 'SOD2- and NRF2-associated Gene Signature to Predict Radioresistance in Head and Neck Cancer.', 'RelB sustains endocrine resistant malignancy: an insight of noncanonical NF-κB pathway into breast Cancer progression.']"""

LPA binds to its specific G-protein-coupled receptors, including LPA1 to LPA6, thereby regulating various physiological functions, including cancer growth, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis. Our previous study showed that LPA promotes the expression of the lymphangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Interestingly, LPA has been shown to regulate the expression of calreticulin (CRT), a multifunctional chaperone protein, but the roles of CRT in PCa progression remain unclear. Here we investigated the involvement of CRT in LPA-mediated VEGF-C expression and lymphangiogenesis in PCa. Knockdown of CRT significantly reduced LPA-induced VEGF-C expression in PC-3 cells. Moreover, LPA promoted CRT expression through LPA receptors LPA1 and LPA3, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). Tumor-xenografted mouse experiments further showed that CRT knockdown suppressed tumor growth and lymphangiogenesis. Notably, clinical evidence indicated that the LPA-producing enzyme autotaxin (ATX) is related to CRT and that CRT level is highly associated with lymphatic vessel density and VEGF-C expression. Interestingly, the pharmacological antagonist of LPA receptors significantly reduced the lymphatic vessel density in tumor and lymph node metastasis in tumor-bearing nude mice.

Here, we found SNORA42 rather than its host gene (KIAA0907) was up-regulated in PCa cell lines. Meanwhile, an obvious up-regulation of SNORA42 was observed in cancer tissues compared to their adjacent normal tissues. SNORA42 could be induced by DHT stimulation. Over-expression of SNORA42 increased prostate cancer cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis. Importantly, SNORA42 increased prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Higher SNORA42 expression level was found to be correlated with shorter survival in metastatic PCa tissues by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, but this effect was not found in primary PCa tissues.

High local sensitivity and good parallel imaging performance are of paramount importance for diagnostic quality and efficiency. The purpose of this work was to evaluate stacked resonators as part of a surface receiver array for prostate MRI at 3 Tesla. A base array of 6-channels consisting of a flexible anterior and a rigid posterior part were built each with three loop coils. A pair of stacked resonators was added concentrically to the center loops (anterior and posterior) of the base array. The evaluated stacked resonators were butterflies, composites and dipoles which yielded a total of three 8-channel arrays. The arrays were compared using noise correlations and single-channel signal-to-noise ratio maps in a phantom. Combined signal-to-noise ratio maps and parallel imaging performances were measured and compared in vivo in 6 healthy volunteers. The results were compared to the base and a commercial array. The SNR values in the prostate yielded by all the arrays were not statistically different using fully sampled k-space. However, significant differences were found in the parallel imaging performance of the arrays. More specifically, up to 88% geometric factor reduction was found compared to the commercial array and up to 83% reduction compared to the base array using butterfly coils. Thus, signal-to-noise ratio improvements were observed with stacked resonators when using parallel imaging. The use of stacked elements, in particular butterfly coils, can improve the performance of a base array consisting solely of single loops when using parallel imaging. We expect prostate MRI at 3 Tesla to benefit from using combinations of single loops and stacked resonators.""","""['Jorge Chacon-Caldera', 'Alexander Fischer', 'Matthias Malzacher', 'Yannik Vetter', 'Mathias Davids', 'Martina Flöser', 'Christopher Stumpf', 'Lothar R Schad']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Experimental verification of SNR and parallel imaging improvements using composite arrays.', 'Increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by using vertically stacked phased array coils for low-field magnetic resonance imaging.', 'A combined 32-channel receive-loops/8-channel transmit-dipoles coil array for whole-brain MR imaging at 7T.', 'Massively parallel MRI detector arrays.', 'Parallel magnetic resonance imaging.']"""

The excited state characteristics of the ligands were explored by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. 3,3'-Diamino-2,2'-bipyridine (1) was previously shown to be weakly fluorescent as a result of π→π* transitions. The other four ligands have properties consistent with an n→π* intraligand charge transfer excited state. Strongly donating amino and aminophenyl (2 and 4) substituents gave low quantum yields, while weaker donating benzimidazole substituents (6 and 7) gave high quantum yields. Absorption and fluorescence wavelengths underwent bathochromic shifts upon ZnII binding in a majority of cases. Quantum yields drastically increased upon ZnII binding for 1 and 2, but decreased for 4, 6, and 7. Compounds 6 and 7 were incubated with PC-3, DU 145 and BPH-1 cells to determine their ZnII sensing abilities in a biological system. Weak fluorescence was observed in BPH-1 cells and subsequent incubation with ZnII caused fluorescence intensity to increase. No fluorescence was observed in PCa cell lines.

The gene encoding the transcription factor ERG shows recurrent rearrangement, resulting in the overexpression of ERG in the majority of prostate cancers. Overexpression of ERG plays a critical role in prostate oncogenesis and development of metastatic disease. Among the downstream effectors of ERG, Frizzled family member FZD4 has been shown to be a target of ERG. Frizzled-8 (FZD8) has been shown to be involved in PCa bone metastasis. In the present study, we show that the expression of FZD8 is directly correlated with ERG expression in PCa. Furthermore, we show that ERG directly targets and activates FZD8 by binding to its promoter. This activation is specific to ETS transcription factor ERG and not ETV1. We propose that ERG overexpression in PCa leads to induction of Frizzled family member FZD8, which is known to activate the Wnt pathway.

However, its association with prognosis is controversial. Overexpression of serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1) was almost exclusively defined in ERG-negative PCa in most studies. This study aimed to determine the association between ERG and SPINK1 expression and the biological aggressiveness of PCa by analyzing their expression in incidental and metastatic cohorts.  Methods:   A total of 143 cystoprostatectomy specimens of invasive bladder cancer and 98 biopsy specimens from de novo metastatic PCa were analyzed. The prostate gland of cystoprostatectomy specimens was fixed and sliced in step sections. Immunohistochemistry of ERG and SPINK1 was conducted, and the results were correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients.  Results:   The overall prevalence of incidental cancer was 32.2% (46/143). The frequencies of both ERG and SPINK1 expression were not significantly different between incidental and metastatic cohorts (15.2% and 14.3%; P = 1.00, and 6.5% and 12.2%; P = 0.38, respectively). In the metastatic cohort, any pre-treatment factors were not significantly associated with the frequencies of ERG and SPINK1 expression. However, SPINK1 expression was significantly associated with a shorter time to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) (P = 0.048). Meanwhile, overall survival was not significantly associated with the expression status of ERG and SPINK1 (P = 0.71).  Conclusions:   ERG and SPINK1 expression may not have significant influence on the metastatic behavior of PCa. SPINK1 expression was significantly associated with a shorter time to CRPC in metastatic PCa.

Methods:   A retrospective case-control study was carried out. Clinical and MRI imaging data of 106 colorectal cancer cases undergoing TLS anterior resection at Department of Colorectal Surgery of Ruijin Hospital between 2013 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed.  Inclusion criteria:   (1) patients receiving TLS anterior resection (Dixon operation); (2) preoperative stageI( to III( malignant tumor;(3) distance of 5-15 cm from inferior margin of tumor to anal verge; and (4) available preoperative rectal MRI.  Exclusion criteria:   (1) patients receiving preoperative adjuvant therapy; (2) patients with low rectal cancer or with local advanced disease; (3) T4b tumor. Rectal MRI was introduced to measure the structure of pelvis. In sagittal view, superior margin of the first sacral vertebrae, superior margin of the third sacral vertebrae, apex of coccyx, and the line of superior margin of pubic symphysis were used to form a pentagon. The 5 lines were marked as N, O, P, Q, R, and the 5 included angles were marked as angle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Organs (uterus and prostate) and tumor (transverse diameter, longitudinal diameter, section area, lesion length, distance to circumference cutting edge) were also measured on MRI. The operative time was applied to be the indicator of operative difficulty and patients were divided into 2 groups according to median operative time. Baseline information (age, gender, BMI, distance from inferior margin of tumor to anal verge, operative history, length of tumor), preoperative tumor staging, and MRI measurements (pelvis, tumor, uterus, prostate), etc were compared between two groups. Factors affecting operative difficulty of TLS were analyzed with logistic regression model.  Results:   Of 106 enrolled patients, 73 were male and 33 female with mean age of (59.8±12.2) years and mean BMI of (22.8±3.3) kg/m2; 25 patients had previous abdominal surgery; distance from inferior margin of tumor to anal verge was (7.4±2.0) cm and the tumor diameter was (3.7±1.4) cm; 24, 36 and 46 patients were in stage I(, II( and III( respectively. All operations were completed successfully. The median number of harvested lymph node was 13(11-16); the median length of distal resection margin was 2.5(2.0-3.1) cm; the median operative time was 2.0(1.5-2.6) hours; the median intraoperative blood loss was 50(0-100) ml; the median time to liquid diet was 4(3-5) days; the median hospital stay was 7(6-10) days. Ten cases (9.4%) developed complications within 30 days after surgery. Patients were divided into ≤2 h group and > 2 h group according to median operative time, and both groups had 53 patients. As compared to ≤2 h group, >2 h group had shorter distance from inferior margin of tumor to anal verge [(6.8 ± 1.5) cm vs. (8.0 ± 2.4) cm, t = 3.174, P = 0.004], lower ratio of (R+N)/(O+P)(1.61±0.27 vs. 1.73±0.19, t = 2.494, P = 0.014), larger transverse distance of tumor [(3.45±0.72) cm vs. (3.05±0.89) cm, t = 0.224, P = 0.027]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the distance from inferior margin of tumor to anal verge was the independent factor affecting operative difficulty(OR=0.584, 95%CI:0.429-0.796, P = 0.001).  Conclusions:   Surgeons may have less difficulty in performing TLS anterior resection for patients with longer distance from inferior margin of tumor to anal verge. In preoperative assessment of operative difficulty of TLS, comprehensive evaluation should be performed. Distance from inferior margin of tumor to anal verge should be regarded as the main factor, and MRI (R+N)/(O+P) and transverse diameter of tumor should be used as important reference, leading to reasonable choice of cases for TLS and smooth pass of study curve.""","""['Haoxuan Wu', 'Tao Zhang', 'Xianze Chen', 'Xiaoqian Jing', 'Xi Cheng', 'Zijia Song', 'Lan Zhu', 'Yonggang He', 'Xiaopin Ji', 'Huan Zhang', 'Ren Zhao']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi""","""['Multimedia article.

Patients and methods:   BPS/IC subjects (10192) and their age- and sex-matched non-BPS/IC control subjects (30576), who had no previous upper urinary tract cancer (UUC), bladder cancer (BC), and prostate cancer (PC), subsequently developed these disorders from the recruited date between 2002 and 2008 and the end of follow-up 2011. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was constructed to estimate the risk of subsequent UUC, BC, and PC following a diagnosis of IC/BPS. The effect of associated comorbidities was measured by Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The risk of outcomes was assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves.  Results:   In the BPS/IC subjects, 37 (0.36%) received a diagnosis of BC, and 22 (0.22%) received a diagnosis of UUC; both were significantly higher than the control group, 19 (0.06%) for BC and 30 (0.10%) for UUC. Cox proportional analysis revealed that the adjusted HR for BC and UUC during the follow-up period for patients with IC/BPS was 5.44 (95% CI: 3.10-9.54) and 1.97 (95% CI: 1.13-3.45) than that of comparison subjects.

Improved prognostication of disease progression is a critical challenge. This study examined alkaline phosphatase velocity (APV) in predicting distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).  Materials and methods:   This retrospective cohort study examined CaP patients enrolled in the Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR) multicenter national database who underwent RP and experienced BCR (n=1783). BCR was defined as a PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL at ≥ 8 weeks post-RP, followed by at least one confirmatory PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL or initiation of salvage therapy. APV was computed as the slope of the linear regression line of all alkaline phosphatase (AP) values after BCR and prior to distant metastasis. APV values in the uppermost quartile were defined as ""rapid"" and compared to the lower three quartiles combined (""slower""). Unadjusted Kaplan Meier (KM) estimation curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis were used to examine predictors of DMFS.  Results:   Of the 1783 eligible patients who experienced post-RP BCR, 701 (39.3%) had necessary AP data for APV calculation. PSA doubling time (PSADT) and APV were strongly associated (p=0.008). No differences in APV were observed across race. In KM analysis, significantly poorer DMFS was observed among the rapid versus slower APV group (Log-rank p=0.003). In multivariable analysis, a rapid APV was predictive of a twofold increased probability of DMFS (HR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.2, 3.9; p = 0.008), controlling for key study covariates.  Conclusions:   Building on previous work, this study found that rapid APV was a strong predictor of DMFS for a broader group of CaP patients, those who undergo post-RP BCR who were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort with long-term follow-up and equal health care access. APV is worth considering as a complementary clinical factor for predicting DMFS.""","""['Carolyn A Salter', 'Jennifer Cullen', 'Claire Kuo', 'Yongmei Chen', 'Lauren Hurwitz', 'Adam R Metwalli', 'Jordan Dimitrakoff', 'Inger L Rosner']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Alkaline phosphatase velocity predicts overall survival and bone metastasis in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Elevated alkaline phosphatase velocity strongly predicts overall survival and the risk of bone metastases in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Three-year postoperative ultrasensitive prostate-specific antigen following open radical retropubic prostatectomy is a predictor for delayed biochemical recurrence.', 'Local Failure Events in Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiotherapy: A Pooled Analysis of 18 Randomized Trials from the Meta-analysis of Randomized Trials in Cancer of the Prostate Consortium (LEVIATHAN).', 'Predictors of Bone Metastases at 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (HSPC) Patients with Early Biochemical Recurrence or Persistence.', 'Machine learning algorithms to estimate 10-Year survival in patients with bone metastases due to prostate cancer: toward a disease-specific survival estimation tool.']"""

Here, we investigated the associations between four nutritional scores and overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer risk in a large prospective population-based cohort: the cancer-specific World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) score, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010), a score based on adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MEDI-LITE), and the French National Nutrition Health Program-Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). This study included 41,543 participants aged ≥40 years from the NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-2017). A total of 1,489 overall incident cancers were diagnosed. A one-point increment of the WCRF/AICR score was significantly associated with decreased overall [12%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 8%-16%; P < 0.0001], breast (14%; 95% CI, 6%-21%; P = 0.001), and prostate (12%; 95% CI, 0%-22%; P = 0.05) cancer risks. Hazard ratio for colorectal cancer risk was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.72-1.03; P = 0.09). The PNNS-GS score was associated with reduced colorectal cancer risk (P = 0.04) and AHEI-2010 was associated with reduced overall cancer risk (P = 0.03). The WCRF/AICR score performed best. Compared with other tested scores, it included a stronger penalty for alcohol, which is a major risk factor for several cancer sites. Better adherence to nutritional recommendations, especially those designed for cancer prevention, could substantially contribute to decreased cancer incidence.Significance: This large prospective population-based cohort study suggests that following dietary recommendations such as the ones proposed by the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research could significantly contribute to cancer prevention.

The quality of life PCa cohort will assess quality of life and patient outcomes in Martinique using a digital platform for patient-reported outcome measures.  Participants:   The Martinique Cancer Registry database is the largest clinical database among the French population-based cancer registries in the Caribbean, including more than 38 000 cancer cases, with 1650 new cancer cases per year, including 550 new PCa cases per year (2010-2014 latest period). In 2018, follow-up will include vital status, assessment of quality of life with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) Core 30 and the Prostate cancer module QLQ-PR25. Urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction recorded prior to treatment will be analysed 1 and 5 years after treatment.  Findings to date:   The registry includes data on circumstances of diagnosis, clinical stage at diagnosis. For PCa, the registry includes blood prostate-specific antigen level at the time of diagnosis, Gleason score and primary treatment.

Unlike nodal staging before radical prostatectomy, data on prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) before sLND are scarce. We analyzed 23 patients undergoing 68Ga-PSMA-PET before sLND and compared the imaging findings with histopathology at sLND. Altogether, 29/109 resected lymph node (LN) fields harbored histologically confirmed LN metastases (26.6%)., The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 89.5%, 74.1%, 70.8%, 90.9%, and 80.4% in side-based analysis, and 75.9%, 87.5%, 68.8%, 90.9%, and 84.4%, respectively, in LN field-based analysis. In contrast to existing studies, sensitivity in particular was lower. This might be because of referral for sLND on the basis of PSMA-PET from 13 different nuclear medicine centers. However, this could still provide more realistic data if sLND should become widely used. Second, our pathologists routinely used immunohistochemistry, resulting in a higher yield of smaller metastases, increasing the accuracy of histopathology. Despite its acceptable accuracy in a real-world scenario, sLND should not only focus on PSMA-PET-positive fields, as small PSMA-PET-negative metastases may be present. PATIENT SUMMARY: We analyzed the accuracy of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) before salvage lymph node dissection in a real-world situation. Although the accuracy is reasonable, resection should not exclusively focus on PSMA-PET-positive fields.""","""['Philipp Mandel', 'Derya Tilki', 'Felix K Chun', 'Eugenia Pristupa', 'Markus Graefen', 'Susanne Klutmann', 'Lars Budäus', 'Thomas Steuber']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Prospective evaluation of the performance of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT(MRI) for lymph node staging in patients undergoing superextended salvage lymph node dissection after radical prostatectomy.', 'Value of 68Ga-PSMA HBED-CC PET for the Assessment of Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence: Comparison with Histopathology After Salvage Lymphadenectomy.', 'Assessing the Best Surgical Template at Salvage Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection for Nodal Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: When Can Bilateral Dissection be Omitted?

The availability of additional models encompassing this heterogeneity would facilitate the identification of more effective therapies for CRPC.  Objective:   To discover therapeutic strategies by exploiting patient-derived models that exemplify the heterogeneity of CRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Four new patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were established from independent metastases of two patients and characterised using integrative genomics. A panel of rationally selected drugs was tested using an innovative ex vivo PDX culture system.  Intervention:   The following drugs were evaluated: AR signalling inhibitors (enzalutamide and galeterone), a PARP inhibitor (talazoparib), a chemotherapeutic (cisplatin), a CDK4/6 inhibitor (ribociclib), bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein inhibitors (iBET151 and JQ1), and inhibitors of ribosome biogenesis/function (RNA polymerase I inhibitor CX-5461 and pan-PIM kinase inhibitor CX-6258).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Drug efficacy in ex vivo cultures of PDX tissues was evaluated using immunohistochemistry for Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 levels. Candidate drugs were also tested for antitumour efficacy in vivo, with tumour volume being the primary endpoint. Two-tailed t tests were used to compare drug and control treatments.  Results and limitations:   Integrative genomics revealed that the new PDXs exhibited heterogeneous mechanisms of resistance, including known and novel AR mutations, genomic structural rearrangements of the AR gene, and a neuroendocrine-like AR-null phenotype. Despite their heterogeneity, all models were sensitive to the combination of ribosome-targeting agents CX-5461 and CX-6258.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that ribosome-targeting drugs may be effective against diverse CRPC subtypes including AR-null disease, and highlights the potential of contemporary patient-derived models to prioritise treatment strategies for clinical translation.

Methods:   The effect of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion on the migration of Treg cells and tumor growth in a mouse model was investigated in vitro and in vivo. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in biopsy tissues was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and the expression of ERG and Forkhead box P3 was detected by gel electrophoresis, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.

While cell behavior can be modulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the roles of lncRNAs within extracellular vesicles (exosomes) are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the involvement and regulatory functions of potential lncRNAs enclosed in exosomes during formation of chemoresistance in human ESCC.  Methods:   Gefitinib-resistant cell lines were established by continuously grafting TE1 and KYSE-450 cells into gefitinib-containing culture medium. LncRNA microarray assay followed by RT-qPCR were used to verify the differential expression of lncRNA Prostate Androgen-Regulated Transcript 1 (PART1) between gefitinib resistant and parental cell lines. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to investigate whether extracellular PART1 could be incorporated into exosomes and transmitted to recipient cells. Subsequently, a series of in vitro assays and a xenograft tumor model were used to observe the functions of lncRNA PART1 in ESCC cells. A signal transduction reporter array, bioinformatics analysis, western blotting, and immunofluorescence were carried out to verify the regulation of PART1 and its downstream Bcl-2 signaling pathway.  Results:   lncRNA PART1 was upregulated in gefitinib-resistant cells when compared to parental ESCC cells. It was found that STAT1 can bind to the promoter region of lncRNA PART1, resulting in its activation. Knockdown of lncRNA PART1 potently promoted the gefitinib-induced cell death, while elevated PART1 promoted gefitinib resistance by competitively binding to miR-129 to facilitate Bcl-2 expression in ESCC cells. In addition, extracellular PART1 could be incorporated into exosomes and transmitted to sensitive cells, thus disseminating gefitinib resistance. Clinically, high levels of serum lncRNA PART1 in exosome were associated with poor response to gefitinib treatment in ESCC patients.  Conclusions:   LncRNA PART1 promotes gefitinib resistance by regulating miR-129/Bcl-2 pathway, and may serve as a therapeutic target for ESCC patients.""","""['Min Kang', 'Meiping Ren', 'Yan Li', 'Yuqiong Fu', 'Minmin Deng', 'Changping Li']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Retraction Note: Exosome-mediated transfer of lncRNA PART1 induces gefitinib resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via functioning as a competing endogenous RNA.', 'lncRNA PART1, manipulated by transcriptional factor FOXP2, suppresses proliferation and invasion in ESCC by regulating the miR‑18a‑5p/SOX6 signaling axis.', 'Exosomal lncRNA ZFAS1 regulates esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis via microRNA-124/STAT3 axis.', 'Long non-coding RNA LINC00337 induces autophagy and chemoresistance to cisplatin in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells via upregulation of TPX2 by recruiting E2F4.', 'Long non‑coding RNA PART1: dual role in cancer.', 'Single-cell RNA-sequencing data reveals the genetic source of extracellular vesicles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Linc01614 Regulates the Proliferation, Apoptosis, and Chemotherapy Resistance in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Targeting Mir-4775.', 'Exosome-mediated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) PART1 suppresses malignant progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma via miR-17-5p/SOCS6 axis.', 'Role of exosomal noncoding RNA in esophageal carcinoma.', 'A comprehensive overview of exosome lncRNAs: Emerging biomarkers and potential therapeutics in gynecological cancers.', 'A review on the role of long non-coding RNA prostate androgen-regulated transcript 1 (PART1) in the etiology of different disorders.']"""
