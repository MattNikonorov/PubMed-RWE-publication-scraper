These conjugates exhibited good to moderate activity against the tested human cancer cell lines. Two of the conjugates (8g and 8j) showed significant antitumor activity against human lung cancer cell line (A549) with IC50 values of 0.51 µM and 0.63 µM respectively. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that these conjugates arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase in human lung cancer cell line (A549). Immune-histochemistry and tubulin polymerization assay suggest inhibition of tubulin.

PD-L1 status as a predictor of treatment response has led to the development of multiple platforms with different reference cutoffs. We studied 128 cases of genitourinary and head/neck carcinomas, aiming to assess the frequency of PD-L1 positivity, interobserver reliability of PD-L1 interpretation, and the concordance of PD-L1 scoring between small samples from tissue microarray and whole sections using SP263 and SP142 clones. No prostatic carcinoma (0/21) was PD-L1 positive compared with 15% to 24% PD-L1 positivity in urothelial carcinoma (UC), hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HP-SCC), and high-grade salivary gland carcinoma. There was substantial interobserver agreement in determining overall PD-L1 positivity in UC and HP-SCC using SP263 (κ = 0.702) and SP142 (κ = 0.757) antibodies. Subgroup analysis for both antibodies showed excellent agreement in UC (κ = 0.812 and 0.827) and moderate agreement in HP-SCC (κ = 0.469 and 0.591). Moderate to substantial agreement between tissue microarray and whole sections was achieved using SP263 (overall, κ = 0.573; UC, κ = 0.424; and HP-SCC, κ = 0.667) and SP142 (UC, κ = 0.493). PD-L1 interpretation in genitourinary and head/neck carcinomas is reliable and reproducible among pathologists and across different tissue preparations. Tumor PD-L1 staining heterogeneity may lead to discrepant PD-L1 results between small biopsies and large sections from surgical resection in a subset of tumors (19% of UC and 15% of HP-SCC). Retesting in such cases may be required to determine patient suitability for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.""","""['Chiyun Wang', 'Elan Hahn', 'Elzbieta Slodkowska', 'Antoine Eskander', 'Danny Enepekides', 'Kevin Higgins', 'Danny Vesprini', 'Stanley K Liu', 'Michelle R Downes', 'Bin Xu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry Assay Concordance in Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder and Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Inter- and intraobserver agreement of programmed death ligand 1 scoring in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma and breast carcinoma.', 'Development of a programmed cell death ligand-1 immunohistochemical assay validated for analysis of non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) as a predictive marker for immunotherapy in solid tumours: a guide to immunohistochemistry implementation and interpretation.', 'PD-L1 evaluation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: Insights regarding specimens, heterogeneity and therapy.', 'Prostate cancer immunotherapy: a review of recent advancements with novel treatment methods and efficacy.', 'Development and applications of computer image analysis algorithms\xa0for\xa0scoring of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry.', 'Prognostic Perspectives of STING and PD-L1 Expression and Correlation with the Prognosis of Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Gastric Cancers.', 'Combining Analysis of Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) and PD-L1 Refined the Prognostication of Breast Cancer Subtypes.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

Idiopathic non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is defined as the absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate due to failed spermatogenesis. There is a high probability that NOA is caused by rare genetic defects. In this study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was applied to two Estonian brothers diagnosed with NOA and Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS). Compound heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants in FANCM (Fanconi anemia complementation group M) were detected as the most likely cause for their condition. A rare maternally inherited frameshift variant p.Gln498Thrfs∗7 (rs761250416) and a previously undescribed splicing variant (c.4387-10A>G) derived from the father introduce a premature STOP codon leading to a truncated protein. FANCM exhibits enhanced testicular expression. In control subjects, immunohistochemical staining localized FANCM to the Sertoli and spermatogenic cells of seminiferous tubules with increasing intensity through germ cell development. This is consistent with its role in maintaining genomic stability in meiosis and mitosis. In the individual with SCOS carrying bi-allelic FANCM LoF variants, none or only faint expression was detected in the Sertoli cells. As further evidence, we detected two additional NOA-affected case subjects with independent FANCM homozygous nonsense variants, one from Estonia (p.Gln1701∗; rs147021911) and another from Portugal (p.Arg1931∗; rs144567652). The study convincingly demonstrates that bi-allelic recessive LoF variants in FANCM cause azoospermia. FANCM pathogenic variants have also been linked with doubled risk of familial breast and ovarian cancer, providing an example mechanism for the association between infertility and cancer risk, supported by published data on Fancm mutant mouse models.""","""['Laura Kasak', 'Margus Punab', 'Liina Nagirnaja', 'Marina Grigorova', 'Ave Minajeva', 'Alexandra M Lopes', 'Anna Maria Punab', 'Kenneth I Aston', 'Filipa Carvalho', 'Eve Laasik', 'Lee B Smith;GEMINI Consortium;Donald F Conrad', 'Maris Laan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Hum Genet""","""['Sertoli cell-only syndrome: advances, challenges, and perspectives in genetics and mechanisms.', ""Sequencing of a 'mouse azoospermia' gene panel in azoospermic men: identification of RNF212 and STAG3 mutations as novel genetic causes of meiotic arrest."", 'Bi-allelic SHOC1 loss-of-function mutations cause meiotic arrest and non-obstructive azoospermia.', 'Novel Bi-Allelic Variants of FANCM Cause Sertoli Cell-Only Syndrome and Non-Obstructive Azoospermia.', 'A novel TEX11 mutation induces azoospermia: a case report of infertile brothers and literature review.', 'A pathogenic variant in the uncharacterized RNF212B gene results in severe aneuploidy male infertility and repeated IVF failure.', 'Sertoli cell-only syndrome: advances, challenges, and perspectives in genetics and mechanisms.', 'Genetic variants underlying spermatogenic arrests in men with non-obstructive azoospermia.', 'Genome-Wide Association Screening Determines Peripheral Players in Male Fertility Maintenance.', 'A homozygous PIWIL2 frameshift variant affects the formation and maintenance of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived spermatogonial stem cells and causes Sertoli cell-only syndrome.']"""

In the present study, a simple closed bipolar electrodes-based electrochemiluminescence (BPEs-ECL) imaging strategy was developed for visual immunoassay of prostate specific antigen (PSA) at single cells using functional nanoprobes of heterogeneous Ru(bpy)32+@SiO2/Au nanoparticles. Multiple-assisted ECL signal amplification strategy was introduced into the detection system on the basis of the synergetic amplifying effect of the anodic and cathodic amplification. On the basis of the synergetic amplifying effect, the detection limits of PSA by using photomultiplier tube and charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging are 3.0 and 31 pg/mL, respectively. The obtained immunosensor was employed to evaluate PSA levels in serum samples with a satisfying result. Moreover, the obtained functional nanoprobes were used to visually profile the PSA expression on the surface of single LNCaP cells (a kind of prostate cancer cells) based on a bare BPE.

Results:   In these 140 patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, 27.1% had PSMA PET/CT-positive findings in the pelvic LNs. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of LN metastases were 53% and 88% (PSMA PET/CT) and 14% and 99% (mpMRI), respectively. The overall BCP rate was 25.7%. The BCP rate was 16.7% in men who were PSMA PET/CT LN-negative compared to 50% in men who were PSMA PET/CT LN-positive (P < 0.05). The presence of PSMA-positive pelvic LNs was more predictive of BCP after RP than cT-stage, PSA level, and the Gleason score, adjusted for surgical margins status.

Here we evaluate the efficacy of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) in oligorecurrent and oligoprogressive PC.  Methods:   We included patients with a maximum of five metastases diagnosed in a maximum of two target organs. Concomitant treatment with hormonal therapies or chemotherapies was allowed. End points of the present study were the outcome in terms of Local control of treated metastases (LC), out-field progression free survival, overall progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival.  Results:   We included in the analysis 64 patients treated on 90 metastases. Fifty (78.1%) patients were treated on lymph nodes, 2 (3.1%) patients simultaneously on lymph node and bone while 10 (15.7%) patients on bone only. Lung metastases were treated in 2 (3.1%) patients. Thirty-seven (57.81%) were without androgen deprivation therapy when treated with SBRT. Median follow-up was 15.2 months. Rates of LC at 6-, 12-, and 18- months were 94%, 88%, and 84%, respectively. Oligoprogressive patients compared to oligorecurrent (HR 9.10, P = 0.049) and prolongation of time from diagnosis of metastases to SBRT (HR 1.03, P = 0.047) were associated with worse LC. Median PFS was 6.6 months (range 1.1-42.4). Castration resistant patients experienced worse PFS compared to castration sensitive group (HR 2.12, P = 0.021).

Excess tissue after diagnosis can be used for research to improve the diagnostic pathway and the vertical assembly of prostate needle biopsy cores into tissue microarrays (TMAs) allows the parallel immunohistochemical (IHC) validation of cancer biomarkers in routine diagnostic specimens. However, tissue within a biopsy core is often heterogeneous and cancer is not uniformly present, resulting in needle biopsy TMAs that suffer from highly variable cancer detection rates that complicate parallel biomarker validation.  Materials and methods:   The prostate cores with the highest tumor burden (in terms of Gleason score and/or maximum cancer core length) were obtained from 249 patients in the PICTURE trial who underwent transperineal template prostate mapping (TPM) biopsy at 5 mm intervals preceded by mpMRI. From each core, 2 mm segments containing tumor or benign tissue (as assessed on H&E pathology) were selected, excised and embedded vertically into a new TMA block. TMA sections were then IHC-stained for the routinely used prostate cancer biomarkers PSA, PSMA, AMACR, p63, and MSMB and assessed using the h-score method. H-scores in patient matched malignant and benign tissue were correlated with the Gleason grade of the original core and the MRI Likert score for the sampled prostate area.  Results:   A total of 2240 TMA cores were stained and IHC h-scores were assigned to 1790. There was a statistically significant difference in h-scores between patient matched malignant and adjacent benign tissue that is independent of Likert score. There was no association between the h-scores and Gleason grade or Likert score within each of the benign or malignant groups.  Conclusion:   The construction of highly selective TMAs from prostate needle biopsy cores is possible. IHC data obtained through this method are highly reliable and can be correlated with imaging. IHC expression patterns for PSA, PSMA, AMACR, p63, and MSMB are distinct in malignant and adjacent benign tissue but did not correlate with mpMRI Likert score.""","""['Jonathan Olivier', 'Vasilis Stavrinides', 'Jonathan Kay', 'Alex Freeman', 'Hayley Pye', 'Zeba Ahmed', 'Lina Carmona Echeverria', 'Susan Heavey', 'Lucy A M Simmons', 'Abi Kanthabalan', 'Manit Arya', 'Tim Briggs', 'Dean Barratt', 'Susan C Charman', 'James Gelister', 'David Hawkes', 'Yipeng Hu', 'Charles Jameson', 'Neil McCartan', 'Shonit Punwani', 'Jan van der Muelen', 'Caroline Moore', 'Mark Emberton', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Hayley C Whitaker']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Magnetic Resonance and Ultrasound Image Fusion Supported Transperineal Prostate Biopsy Using the Ginsburg Protocol: Technique, Learning Points, and Biopsy Results.', 'The influence of prostate-specific antigen density on positive and negative predictive values of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to detect Gleason score 7-10 prostate cancer in a repeat biopsy setting.', 'Comparison of free-hand transperineal mpMRI/TRUS fusion-guided biopsy with transperineal 12-core systematic biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a single-center prospective study in China.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

In 2014, the Movember Foundation launched a Global Action Plan 1 (GAP1) project to support an international collaborative prostate cancer PDX program involving eleven groups. Between these Movember consortium members, a total of 98 authenticated human prostate cancer PDXs were available for characterization. Eighty three of these were derived directly from patient material, and 15 were derived as variants of patient-derived material via serial passage in androgen deprived hosts. A major goal of the Movember GAP1 PDX project was to provide the prostate cancer research community with a summary of both the basic characteristics of the 98 available authenticated serially transplantable human prostate cancer PDX models and the appropriate contact information for collaborations. Herein, we report a summary of these PDX models.  Methods:   PDX models were established in immunocompromised mice via subcutaneous or subrenal-capsule implantation. Dual-label species (ie, human vs mouse) specific centromere and telomere Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and immuno-histochemical (IHC) staining of tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing replicates of the PDX models were used for characterization of expression of a number of phenotypic markers important for prostate cancer including AR (assessed by IHC and FISH), Ki67, vimentin, RB1, P-Akt, chromogranin A (CgA), p53, ERG, PTEN, PSMA, and epithelial cytokeratins.  Results:   Within this series of PDX models, the full spectrum of clinical disease stages is represented, including androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant primary and metastatic prostate adenocarcinomas as well as prostate carcinomas with neuroendocrine differentiation. The annotated clinical characteristics of these PDXs were correlated with their marker expression profile.  Conclusion:   Our results demonstrate the clinical relevance of this series of PDXs as a platform for both basic science studies and therapeutic discovery/drug development. The present report provides the prostate cancer community with a summary of the basic characteristics and a contact information for collaborations using these models.""","""['Nora M Navone', 'Wytske M van Weerden', 'Robert L Vessella', 'Elizabeth D Williams', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'John T Isaacs', 'Holly M Nguyen', 'Zoran Culig', 'Gabri van der Pluijm', 'Cyril A Rentsch', 'Rute B Marques', 'Corrina M A de Ridder', 'Lukas Bubendorf', 'George N Thalmann', 'William Nathaniel Brennen', 'Frédéric R Santer', 'Patrizia L Moser', 'Peter Shepherd', 'Eleni Efstathiou', 'Hui Xue', 'Dong Lin', 'Jeroen Buijs', 'Tjalling Bosse', 'Anne Collins', 'Norman Maitland', 'Mark Buzza', 'Michelle Kouspou', 'Ariel Achtman', 'Renea A Taylor', 'Gail Risbridger', 'Eva Corey']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Establishing a cryopreservation protocol for patient-derived xenografts of prostate cancer.', 'Establishment of primary patient-derived xenografts of palliative TURP specimens to study castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'An original patient-derived xenograft of prostate cancer with cyst formation.', 'Subrenal capsule grafting technology in human cancer modeling and translational cancer research.', 'The what, when, and why of human prostate cancer xenografts.', 'Prostate organoids: emerging experimental tools for translational research.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.', 'IL-1β expression driven by androgen receptor absence or inactivation promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'A 3D Perfusable Platform for In Vitro Culture of Patient Derived Xenografts.', 'Patient-Derived Xenografts and Organoids Recapitulate Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer with Sustained Androgen Receptor Signaling.']"""

We examined the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], and cancer survival in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. Of 4616 cancer cases with measured serum 25(OH)D, 2884 died of their cancer during 28 years of follow-up and 1732 survived or died of other causes. Proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D and overall and site-specific survival. Serum 25(OH)D was significantly lower among cases who subsequently died from their malignancy compared with those who did not (medians 34.7 vs. 36.5 nmol/L, respectively; p = 0.01). Higher 25(OH)D was associated with lower overall cancer mortality (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.85 for highest vs. lowest quintile, p-trend < 0.0001).

Improved survival was also suggested for head and neck, gastric, pancreatic, and liver cancers, though not statistically significantly, and case numbers for the latter two organ sites were small.

HML2 is the clade of these viruses which contains the most intact provirus copies. These elements can be transcribed and translated in healthy and diseased tissues, and some of them produce active retroviral enzymes, such as protease. Retroviral gene products, including protease, contribute to illness in exogenous retroviral infections. There are ongoing efforts to test anti-retroviral regimens against endogenous retroviruses. Herein, we examine the potential activity and diversity of human endogenous retrovirus-K proteases, and their potential for impact on immunity and human disease. Results: Sequences similar to the endogenous retrovirus-K HML2 protease and reverse transcriptase were identified in the human genome, classified by phylogenetic inference and compared to Repbase reference sequences. The topologies of trees inferred from protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were similar and agreed with the classification using reference sequences. Surprisingly, only 62/480 protease sequences identified by BLAST were classified as HML2; the remainder were classified as other HML groups, with the majority (216) classified as HML3. Variation in functionally significant protease motifs was explored, and two major active site variants were identified - the DTGAD variant is common in all groups, but the DTGVD motif appears limited to HML3, HML5, and HML6. Furthermore, distinct RNA expression patterns of protease variants are seen in disease states, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Conclusion: Transcribed ERVK proteases exhibit a diversity which could impact immunity and inhibitor-based treatments, and these facets should be considered when designing therapeutic regimens.""","""['Matthew G Turnbull', 'Renée N Douville']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Front Microbiol""","""['Human endogenous retrovirus-K (HML-2): a comprehensive review.', 'Genomic organization of the human endogenous retrovirus HERV-K(HML-2.HOM) (ERVK6) on chromosome 7.', 'Susceptibility of Human Endogenous Retrovirus Type K to Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors.', 'Predicted Cellular Interactors of the Endogenous Retrovirus-K Integrase Enzyme.', 'Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HML-2) in Health and Disease.', 'Detection and Characterisation of an Endogenous Betaretrovirus in Australian Wild Deer.', 'Pro-Inflammatory Signaling Upregulates a Neurotoxic Conotoxin-Like Protein Encrypted Within Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K.', 'Grand Challenge in Human/Animal Virology: Unseen, Smallest Replicative Entities Shape the Whole Globe.']"""

AR (androgen receptor) and PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2) have key roles in these processes. We report in this study, KDM8/JMJD5, a histone lysine demethylase/dioxygnase, exhibits a novel property as a dual coactivator of AR and PKM2 and as such, it is a potent inducer of castration and therapy resistance. Previously, we showed that KDM8 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and tumor metabolism in breast cancer cells. Its role in prostate cancer has not been explored. Here, we show that KDM8's oncogenic properties in prostate cancer come from its direct interaction (1) with AR to affect androgen response and (2) with PKM2 to regulate tumor metabolism. The interaction with AR leads to the elevated expression of androgen response genes in androgen-deprived conditions. They include ANCCA/ATAD2 and EZH2, which are directly targeted by KDM8 and involved in sustaining the survival of the cells under hormone-deprived conditions. Notably, in enzalutamide-resistant cells, the expressions of both KDM8 and EZH2 are further elevated, so are neuroendocrine markers. Consequently, EZH2 inhibitors or KDM8 knockdown both resensitize the cells toward enzalutamide. In the cytosol, KDM8 associates with PKM2, the gatekeeper of pyruvate flux and translocates PKM2 into the nucleus, where the KDM8/PKM2 complex serves as a coactivator of HIF-1α to upregulate glycolytic genes. Using shRNA knockdown, we validate KDM8's functions as a regulator for both androgen-responsive and metabolic genes. KDM8 thus presents itself as an ideal therapeutic target for metabolic adaptation and castration-resistance of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Hung-Jung Wang', 'Mamata Pochampalli', 'Ling-Yu Wang', 'June X Zou', 'Pei-Shan Li', 'Sheng-Chieh Hsu', 'Bi-Juan Wang', 'Shih-Han Huang', 'Ping Yang', 'Joy C Yang', 'Cheng-Ying Chu', 'Chia-Ling Hsieh', 'Shian-Ying Sung', 'Chien-Feng Li', 'Clifford G Tepper', 'David K Ann', 'Allen C Gao', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Yoshihiro Izumiya', 'Chi-Pin Chuu', 'Wen-Ching Wang', 'Hong-Wu Chen', 'Hsing-Jien Kung']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'JMJD5 regulates PKM2 nuclear translocation and reprograms HIF-1α-mediated glucose metabolism.', 'Dual targeting of the androgen receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α pathways synergistically inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms of drug resistance that target the androgen axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'JMJD6 functions as an oncogene and is associated with poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Histone Demethylase Modulation: Epigenetic Strategy to Combat Cancer Progression.', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.', 'JMJD5 inhibits lung cancer progression by regulating glucose metabolism through the p53/TIGAR pathway.', 'The epigenetic function of androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.']"""

Preclinical studies found that vitamin D regulates IGFBP-3 expression, although evidence from epidemiologic studies is conflicting.  Methods:   Mendelian randomization analyses (MR) were conducted to reassess associations between IGFBP-3 and prostate cancer risk and advanced prostate cancer using summary statistics from the PRACTICAL consortium (44,825 cases; 27,904 controls). Observational and MR analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between inactive vitamin D [25(OH)D] and IGFBP-3 using data from the ProtecT study (1,366 cases;1,071 controls) and summary statistics from the CHARGE consortium (n = 18,995).  Results:   The OR for prostate cancer per SD unit increase in circulating IGFBP-3 was 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.28]. The OR for advanced prostate cancer per SD unit increase in IGFBP-3 was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.07-1.40). Observationally, a SD increase in 25(OH)D was associated with a 0.1SD (95% CI, 0.05-0.14) increase in IGFBP-3. MR analyses found little evidence for a causal relationship between circulating 25(OH)D and IGFBP-3 in the circulation.  Conclusions:   This study provided confirmatory evidence that IGFBP-3 is a risk factor for prostate cancer risk and progression. Observationally, there was evidence that 25(OH)D is associated with IGFBP-3, but MR analyses suggested that these findings were unlikely to be causal. Findings may be limited by the nature of instrumentation of 25(OH)D and IGFBP-3 and the utility of circulating measures. 25(OH)D appears unlikely to be causally related to IGFBP-3 in the circulation, however, our findings do not preclude causal associations at the tissue level.

The objective of this prospective prostate and pelvic SABR study is to report the acute toxicity, late toxicity, and quality of life (QoL) after study completion.  Methods and materials:   A phase 1/2 study was conducted for patients with high-risk prostate cancer. Radiation therapy was planned to deliver 25 Gy to pelvis and seminal vesicles (SV) and a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) of up to 40 Gy to the prostate in 5 fractions, weekly, over 29 days. Androgen deprivation therapy was used for 12 to 18 months. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 was used to assess worst acute and late toxicities.

Purpose:   To develop and evaluate a system that combines patient-specific 3D-printed molds with ex vivo MRI (ExV) to spatially align in vivo MRI (InV), ExV, and WMHP in PCa patients.  Study type:   Prospective cohort study.  Population:   Seventeen PCa patients who underwent 3T MRI and robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP).  Field strength/sequences:   T2 -weighted turbo spin-echo sequences at 3T.  Assessment:   Immediately after RALP, the fresh whole prostate specimens were imaged in patient-specific 3D-printed molds by 3T MRI and then sectioned to create WMHP slides. The time required for ExV was measured to assess impact on workflow. InV, ExV, and WMHP images were registered. Spatial alignment was evaluated using: slide offset (mm) between ExV slice locations and WMHP slides; overlap of the 3D prostate contour on InV versus ExV using Dice's coefficient (0 to 1); and 2D target registration error (TRE, mm) between corresponding landmarks on InV, ExV, and WMHP. Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD).  Statistical testing:   Differences in 2D TRE before versus after registration were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P < 0.05 considered significant).  Results:   ExV (duration 115 ± 15 min) was successfully incorporated into the workflow for all cases. Absolute slide offset was 1.58 ± 1.57 mm. Dice's coefficient was 0.865 ± 0.035. 2D TRE was significantly reduced after registration (P < 0.01) with mean (±SD of per patient means) of 1.9 ± 0.6 mm for InV versus ExV, 1.4 ± 0.5 mm for WMHP versus ExV, and 2.0 ± 0.5 mm for WMHP versus InV.  Data conclusion:   The proposed system combines patient-specific 3D-printed molds with ExV to achieve spatial alignment between InV, ExV, and WMHP with mean 2D TRE of 1-2 mm.

Materials and methods:   Here, we employed a firefly luciferase reporter driven by the TMEPAI gene promoter to screen for compound capable of inhibiting the expression of TMEPAI, and the effects of TMEPAI inhibitor on cancer cell proliferation were evaluated using the colony formation assay, cell cycle analysis, Ki-67 immunofluorescence assay and EdU incorporation assay.  Results:   2-(2-nitrobenzylidene) indolin-3-one (JHY-A007-50) was identified and shown to effectively inhibit the TMEPAI promoter activity. Further studies revealed that JHY-A007-50 specifically inhibited the expression of TMEPAI at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, we found that JHY-A007-50 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Our results showed that overexpression of TMEPAI decreased the inhibitory effects of JHY-A007-50 on cancer cell proliferation, and JHY-A007-50 did not affect the cell viability of HeLa cells knocked down of TMEPAI.

We investigated therapeutic effect of a dietary metabolite Urolithin A (UroA) and dissected the molecular mechanism in CRPC cells. Treatment with UroA inhibited cell proliferation in both androgen receptor-positive (AR+ ) (C4-2B) and androgen receptor-negative (AR- ) (PC-3) cells however, AR+ CaP cells were more sensitive to UroA treatment as compared with AR- CaP cells. Inhibition of the AR signaling was responsible for the UroA effect on AR+ CaP cells. Ectopic expression of AR in PC-3 cells sensitized them to UroA treatment as compared to the vector-expresseing PC-3 cells, which suggests that AR could be a target of UroA. Similarly, in enzalutamide-resistant C4-2B cells, a downregulation of AR expression also suppressed cell proliferation which was observed with the UroA treatment. Oral administration of UroA significantly suppressed the growth of C4-2B xenografts (P = 0.05) compared with PC-3 xenografts (P = 0.069) without causing toxicity to animals.

But the high dimension of these datasets makes the classification challenging due to the presence of many irrelevant and redundant features. Hence, feature selection becomes irreplaceable in this field because of its ability to remove the unrequired features from the system. As the task of selecting the optimal number of features is an NP-hard problem, hence, some meta-heuristic search technique helps to cope up with this problem. In this paper, we propose a 2-stage model for feature selection in microarray datasets. The ranking of the genes for the different filter methods are quite diverse and effectiveness of rankings is datasets dependent. First, we develop an ensemble of filter methods by considering the union and intersection of the top-n features of ReliefF, chi-square, and symmetrical uncertainty. This ensemble allows us to combine all the information of the three rankings together in a subset. In the next stage, we use genetic algorithm (GA) on the union and intersection to get the fine-tuned results, and union performs better than the latter. Our model has been shown to be classifier independent through the use of three classifiers-multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (K-NN). We have tested our model on five cancer datasets-colon, lung, leukemia, SRBCT, and prostate. Experimental results illustrate the superiority of our model in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

We evaluated the level 5-AR 2 protein expression and the relationship between methylation of the 5-AR 2 gene-promoter and 5-AR 2 protein expression of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Materials and methods:   A total of 37 prostate samples were evaluated. These included 22 samples from men undergoing transurethral prostate resections and 15 non-cancerous transition-zone human prostate tissue samples taken following radical prostatectomy. We quantified 5-AR 2 protein expression and gene-promoter methylation status using common assay procedures. Clinical variables included age, body mass index (BMI), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, lipid profiles, and prostate volumes. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed followed by stepwise logistic regression modeling.  Results:   We were able to extract DNA from 36 of the 37 tissue samples and 10 of these (28%) did not express the 5-AR 2 protein. In total, 26 patients (72%) had methylated 5-AR 2 promoter-regions. There was a strong correlation between methylation of the 5-AR 2 promoter-regions and low-absent 5-AR 2 protein expression (p = 0.0003). Increasing age significantly predicted methylation status and protein expression level (p = 0.013).  Conclusions:   The level of 5-AR 2 protein expression varies among prostate tissue samples. Methylation of the 5-AR 2 gene-promoter may account for low or absent expression of 5-AR 2 in adult human prostate tissues. Increased age correlates with increased 5-AR 2 gene-promoter methylation and decreased protein expression in men with BPH.""","""['Pil Moon Kang', 'Young Jin Kim', 'Won Tae Seo', 'Su Hwan Kang', 'Taek Sang Kim', 'Bong Kwon Chun', 'Won Ik Seo', 'Jee-Yeong Jeong', 'Jae Il Chung']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Age and Obesity Promote Methylation and Suppression of 5α-Reductase 2: Implications for Personalized Therapy of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Reduced levels of 5-α reductase 2 in adult prostate tissue and implications for BPH therapy.', 'DNA methyl transferase 1 reduces expression of SRD5A2 in the aging adult prostate.', 'Differential expression of 5-alpha reductase isozymes in the prostate and its clinical implications.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Upregulation of mir-1199-5p is associated with reduced type 2 5-α reductase expression in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'METTL3 promotes prostatic hyperplasia by regulating PTEN expression in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner.', 'Epigenetic reprogramming during prostate cancer progression: A perspective from development.', 'Methylated CpG dinucleotides in the 5-α reductase 2 gene may explain finasteride resistance in benign prostatic enlargement patients.', 'BPH: Why Do Patients Fail Medical Therapy?']"""

We monitored CHD1 expression during disease progression and assessed the molecular and clinical characteristics of CHD1-deleted/SPOP-mutated metastatic CRPC (mCRPC).Experimental Design: We identified 89 patients with mCRPC who had hormone-naive and castration-resistant tumor samples available: These were analyzed for CHD1, PTEN, and ERG expression by IHC. SPOP status was determined by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). We studied the correlations between these biomarkers and (i) overall survival from diagnosis; (ii) overall survival from CRPC; (iii) duration of abiraterone treatment; and (iv) response to abiraterone. Relationship with outcome was analyzed using Cox regression and log-rank analyses.Results: CHD1 protein loss was detected in 11 (15%) and 13 (17%) of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) and CRPC biopsies, respectively. Comparison of CHD1 expression was feasible in 56 matched, same patient HSPC and CRPC biopsies. CHD1 protein status in HSPC and CRPC correlated in 55 of 56 cases (98%). We identified 22 patients with somatic SPOP mutations, with six of these mutations not reported previously in prostate cancer.

Health-care practitioners are ideally positioned to promote physical activity to their patients. AIM To identify factors that influenced health care practitioners to either promote or not promote physical activity to their patients with PCa. METHODS Individual interviews were conducted with 16 Auckland-based health-care practitioners, including specialists (oncologists and urologists), physiotherapists and complementary and alternative (acupuncturists) health-care practitioners. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS Treatment-related factors (ie counteracting side-effects of hormone suppression treatment), longer life expectancy and risk factors for other conditions appeared to influence the promotion of physical activity to patients. Time constraints of consultations and complex medical issues were barriers to the promotion of physical activity. CONCLUSIONS This study found that a variety of health-care practitioners are providing some degree of physical activity advice to their patients with PCa. Collaborative practice among health-care practitioners to verbally reinforce the benefits of physical activity, coupled with referral to experts in physical activity promotion/rehabilitation (such as physiotherapists), should be encouraged for best practice care.""","""['Asmita Patel', 'Grant Schofield', 'Justin Keogh']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Prim Health Care""","""[""Promoting physical activity in primary care settings: health visitors' and practice nurses' views and experiences."", 'Referral to specialist physiotherapists in the management of whiplash associated disorders: Perspectives of healthcare practitioners.', 'Perceived barriers and facilitators to physical activity in men with prostate cancer: possible influence of androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Get moving!

Recently, in human prostate cancer cell lines the receptor was also observed, therefore it may be a potential target for the disease. 18F-Al-NOTA-MAL-Cys39- exendin-4 holds great promise for GLP-1R. Therefore, the feasibility of the 18F-labeled exendin-4 analog for prostate cancer imaging was investigated.  Methods:   New probe 18F-Al-NOTA-MAL-Cys39-exendin-4 was made through one-step fluorination. Prostate cancer PC3 cell xenograft model mice were established to primarily evaluate the imaging properties of the tracer via small animal PET studies in vivo. Pathological studies and Western Blots were also performed.  Results:   PC-3 prostate xenografts were clearly imaged under baseline conditions. At 30 and 60 min postinjection, the tumor uptakes were 2.90±0.41%ID/g and 2.26±0.32 %ID/g respectively. The presence of cys39-exendin-4 significantly reduced the tumor uptake to 0.82±0.10 %ID/g at 60 min p.i. Findings of ex vivo biodistribution studies were similar to those of in vivo PET imaging. The tumors to blood and muscles were significantly improved with the increase of time due to rapid clearance of the tracer from normal organs. Low levels of radioactivity were also detected in the GLP-1R positive tumor and normal organs after coinjection with excessive unlabeled peptides. Immunohistochemistry and Western Blots results confirmed that GLP-1R was widely expressed in PC-3 prostate cancers.  Conclusion:   18F-Al labeled exendin-4 analog might be a promising tracer for in vivo detecting GLP-1R positive prostate cancer with the advantage of facile synthesis and favorable pharmacokinetics.

Metformin or insulin use was not associated with changes in biochemical tumor recurrence or PCa specific mortality rates. However, tissue TMA analyses by IHC showed decreased mTOR activation, as indicated by phospho-mTOR in cancer tissue of patients with metformin and also with insulin use compared to the control group. In addition, we were able to show that the androgen receptor and the epithelial-cell contact marker E-cadherin decreased upon metformin use compared to the control group.

Thus there is tremendous interest in Apo2L/TRAIL therapy; however, drug resistance is a serious limitation. Autophagy is a cellular housekeeping process that controls protein and organelle turnover, and is almost consistently activated in response to apoptosis-inducing stimuli, including Apo2L/TRAIL. Unlike apoptosis, autophagy leads to cell death or survival depending on the context. Various molecular mechanisms by which autophagy regulates Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis have been identified. Further, whether autophagy is completed (intact autophagic flux) or not could determine the fate of cancer cells, either cell survival or death. Thus, targeting autophagy is an attractive strategy to overcome Apo2L/TRAIL resistance.

In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of a comprehensive, lifestyle medicine intervention, Lifestyle 180®, on chronic disease risk factors and quality of life in cancer survivors.  Design:   Retrospective subgroup analysis of a clinical program.  Settings/location:   An outpatient medical facility.  Subjects:   Lifestyle 180 participants with a diagnosis of past cancer.  Intervention:   Sixty-four hours of intensive nutrition, culinary medicine, physical activity, and stress relief practices over a 6-month period, with 9- and 12-month follow-up.  Outcome measures:   Pre-postanalysis (baseline vs. 12 months) included biometrics: weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and blood pressure; standard laboratory tests: lipids, C-reactive protein, fasting insulin/glucose, and insulin resistance; and empirically validated questionnaires: perceived stress, depression, and quality of life.  Results:   Fifty-eight cancer survivors participated in Lifestyle 180. Average age was 63 years, roughly 75% of participants were female, and the greatest majority had a diagnosis of breast, prostate, or skin cancer. Diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and prediabetes presented in 47%, 57%, 22%, and 50% of patients, respectively. Forty-five percent of patients were obese, 24% were overweight, and 16% were depressed. At 12 months, participants lost an average of 14 pounds (-6.6%, p < 0.001) and 2.6 inches off their waist (-5.9%, p < 0.001). BMI decreased significantly by an average of 2.4 kg/m2 (-6.8%, p < 0.001). Significant decreases from well-managed baseline levels also occurred in most measured biomarkers (average change: high-density lipoprotein +3.3 mg/dL, p < 0.05; triglycerides -23.0 mg/dL, p < 0.01; C-reactive protein -1.3 mg/L, p < 0.01; fasting insulin -4.2 μU/mL, p < 0.05; and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance -1.5, p < 0.01; n = 40). Changes in psychosocial variables included significant improvements in perceived stress (-20%, p < 0.01) and quality of life (+54%, p < 0.001). We were unable to detect a difference in depressive symptoms.  Conclusions:   Cancer survivors participating in a comprehensive intervention could employ the prescribed lifestyle modifications to produce clinically relevant health and quality-of-life benefits.

We have previously reported that the combined inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cyclooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2) led to an increased antitumor activity of docetaxel in CRPC. In the present study, we explored the efﬁcacy of the combination of EGFR inhibition (by gefitinib) and COX‑2 inhibition (by celecoxib) as a potential treatment for docetaxel‑resistant CRPC. We established two docetaxel‑resistant prostate cancer cell lines, PC3/DR and DU145/DR, by culturing PC3 and DU145 cells in docetaxel in a dose‑escalating manner. The EGFR and COX‑2 protein expression levels were determined. The effects of gefitinib and celecoxib on cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. In vitro changes in Bcl‑2, FOXM1 and ABCB1 expression were analyzed. The expression of Ki‑67 and cleaved‑caspase‑3 was also examined in DU145/DR tumor tissue. The enhanced expression of EGFR and COX‑2 was observed in docetaxel‑resistant CRPC relative to the parental cell lines. MTT, clone formation and fluorescence‑activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses demonstrated that gefitinib and celecoxib in combination decreased cell viability and enhanced the rate of apoptosis when compared with either drug used alone. Additionally, the combination treatment was superior in inhibiting cell invasion and induced significant decreases in Bcl‑2, FOXM1 and ABCB1 expression levels. Furthermore, the gefitinib‑celecoxib combination inhibited DU145/DR tumor growth to a greater extent than either treatment used individually. The expression of Ki‑67 was reduced, whereas cleaved‑caspase‑3 protein expression was increased in the tumors from the combination therapy group. In conclusion, the combined inhibition of EGFR and COX‑2 by gefitinib and celecoxib may overcome docetaxel resistance in human CRPC.

In the present study, miR‑205 expression was examined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. miR‑205 mimics were transfected into PC‑3 cells using the UTMD method, and the PC‑3 cells were also treated with cisplatin. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion abilities were detected using Cell Counting kit‑8, flow cytometry, wound healing and Transwell assays, respectively. In addition, the protein expression levels of caspase‑9, cleaved‑caspase 9, cytochrome c (cytoc), epithelial (E)‑cadherin, matrix metalloproteinase‑9 (MMP‑9), phosphorylated (p)‑extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) and ERK were measured by western blot analysis. The results of the present study demonstrated that miR‑205 expression was low in human PCa cell lines compared with healthy cells and that UTMD‑mediated miR‑205 delivery inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis modulated by cisplatin compared with UTMD‑mediated miR‑negative control group and miR‑205‑treated group. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that UTMD‑mediated miR‑205 transfection increased the expression of caspase‑9, cleaved‑caspase 9, cytochrome c and E‑cadherin, and decreased the expression of MMP‑9 and p‑ERK.

C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1) has been demonstrated to promote metastases in different types of tumors. The authors' previous studies demonstrated that the CX3CL1 (also termed fractalkine)/steroid receptor coactivator (Src)/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway is associated with spinal metastasis. In the present study, it was observed that CX3CL1/C-X3-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) was overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues with spinal metastasis compared with primary tumors. Overexpression of CX3CR1 induced cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibited cellular apoptosis. However, repression of CX3CR1 reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and increased cellular apoptosis. In addition, the Src/FAK pathway was activated by CX3CL1, which depends on the Tyr992 residue of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for phosphorylation.

SDC1 expression is inversely related to aggressiveness in prostate cancer (PCa). During epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), loss of epithelial markers is mediated by transcriptional repressors such as SNAIL, SLUG, or ZEB1/2 that bind to E-box promoter sequences of specific genes. The effect of these repressors on SDC-1 expression remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that SNAIL, SLUG and ZEB1 expressions are increased in advanced PCa, contrarily to SDC-1. SNAIL, SLUG and ZEB1 also showed an inversion to SDC-1 in prostate cell lines. ZEB1, but not SNAIL or SLUG, represses SDC-1 as demonstrated by experiments of ectopic expression in epithelial prostate cell lines. Inversely, expression of ZEB1 shRNA in PCa cell line increased SDC-1 expression. The effect of ZEB1 is transcriptional since ectopic expression of this gene represses SDC-1 promoter activity and ZEB1 binds to the SDC-1 promoter as detected by ChIP assays. An epigenetic mark associated to transcription repression H3K27me3 was bound to the same sites that ZEB1. In conclusion, this study identifies ZEB1 as a key repressor of SDC-1 during PCa progression and point to ZEB1 as a potentially diagnostic marker for PCa.""","""['Nancy Farfán', 'Nallatt Ocarez', 'Enrique A Castellón', 'Nilo Mejía', 'Antonio García de Herreros', 'Héctor R Contreras']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Evaluating the role of hsa-miR-200c in reversing the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Transcriptional activation of ZEB1 by Slug leads to cooperative regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like phenotype in melanoma.', 'CLCA2 epigenetic regulation by CTBP1, HDACs, ZEB1, EP300 and miR-196b-5p impacts prostate cancer cell adhesion and EMT in metabolic syndrome disease.', 'The Transcription Factors Zeb1 and Snail Induce Cell Malignancy and Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype in Prostate Cells, Increasing Androgen Synthesis Capacity and Therapy Resistance.', 'The multiverse nature of epithelial to mesenchymal transition.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Proteoglycans Determine the Dynamic Landscape of EMT and Cancer Cell Stemness.', 'Nuclear Syndecan-1 Regulates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Plasticity in Tumor Cells.', 'Syndecan-1 (CD138), Carcinomas and EMT.', 'Proteoglycans as Mediators of Cancer Tissue Mechanics.']"""

Exposure to BPA or NP is related to cell death, hormonal deregulation, and cancer onset. Our previous studies showed that both compounds induce A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) activation. Here, we show that BPA and NP induce apoptosis in prostate and ovary cancer cell lines, in a process dependent on ADAM17 activation. ADAM17 knockdown completely prevented apoptosis as well as the shedding of ADAM17 substrates. Both compounds were found to induce an increase in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) only in Ca2+-containing medium, with the NP-treated cells response being more robust than those treated with BPA. Additionally, using a phosphorylated protein microarray, we found that both compounds stimulate common intracellular pathways related to cell growth, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. These results suggest that BPA and NP could induce apoptosis through ADAM17 by activating different intracellular signaling pathways that may converge in different cellular responses, one of which is apoptosis.

The prevalence of increased surface expression and constitutive internalization of PSMA make it an attractive target for an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) approach to treating patients with mCRPC. MEDI3726 (previously known as ADCT-401) is an ADC consisting of an engineered version of the anti-PSMA antibody J591 site specifically conjugated to the pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer tesirine. MEDI3726 specifically binds the extracellular domain of PSMA and, once internalized, releases the PBD dimer to crosslink DNA and trigger cell death. In vitro, MEDI3726 demonstrated potent and specific cytotoxicity in a panel of PSMA-positive prostate cancer cell lines, consistent with internalization and DNA interstrand crosslinking. In vivo, MEDI3726 showed robust antitumor activity against the LNCaP and the castration-resistant CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cell line xenografts. MEDI3726 also demonstrated durable antitumor activity in the PSMA-positive human prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) LuCaP models.

Objective:   To quantify the incidence of surgical overtreatment over time among a contemporary series of men diagnosed with CaP.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and pathologic specimens for men with CaP who underwent radical prostatectomy between January 2009 and December 2016 at a tertiary referral center. Overtreatment, defined as presence of iCaP in radical prostatectomy specimens, was the primary endpoint. iCaP was defined as a tumor of Gleason score no more than 6 and a tumor diameter ≤10mm (volume <0.5 cc). Independent predictors of iCaP were determined using a multivariable model.  Results:   A total of 1,283 men were eligible for analysis. Overtreatment was found in 86 (6.7%) patients. The frequency of overtreatment significantly decreased from 15% (24/165) in 2009 to 3% (4/134) of patients in 2016 (P < 0.001). In the multivariable analysis, prostate-specific antigen density ≥0.15 vs. <0.15 (odds ratio [OR] 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.64, P < 0.01), biopsy Gleason score 3+4 vs. 3+3 (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.08-0.29, P < 0.01), African American vs. White ethnicity (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.96, P = 0.045), and year of surgery (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-0.99, P = 0.03) remained significant predictors of iCaP at surgery. Over the years of study, the odds of overtreatment decreased by 12% annually (OR 0.88, 95 CI 0.77-0.99, P = 0.03). At the same time, the pathological evidence of advanced disease at surgery (≥T3a with/without lymph node involvement) remained unchanged.  Comment:   Surgical overtreatment of CaP has declined to a rate of approximately 3% at this tertiary referral center; further decline is likely. The decline probably has a multifactorial explanation: decreased rate of overdiagnosis, better patient selection for surgery, or change in the referral pattern.""","""['Amirali Salmasi', 'Izak Faiena', 'Jason Wu', 'Anthony E Sisk Jr', 'Ankush Sachveda', 'Jacob J Vandel', 'Karim Chamie', 'Leonard S Marks', 'Robert E Reiter']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Variation in surgical treatment patterns for patients with prostate cancer in the United States: Do patients in academic hospitals fare better?', 'Clinical and pathologic outcome after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer patients with a preoperative Gleason sum of 8 to 10.', 'Improved risk stratification for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy using a novel risk group system based on prostate specific antigen density and biopsy Gleason score.', 'Perineural invasion status, Gleason score and number of positive cores in biopsy pathology are predictors of positive surgical margin following laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Considering the role of radical prostatectomy in 21st century prostate cancer care.']"""

There are a number of options for patients with localized early stage disease, including active surveillance for low-risk disease, surgery, brachytherapy, and external beam radiotherapy. Increasingly, external beam radiotherapy, in the form of dose-escalated and moderately hypofractionated regimens, is being utilized in prostate cancer, with randomized evidence to support their use. Stereotactic body radiotherapy, which is a form of extreme hypofractionation, delivered with high precision and conformality typically over 1 to 5 fractions, offers a more contemporary approach with several advantages including being non-invasive, cost-effective, convenient for patients, and potentially improving patient access. In fact, one study has estimated that if half of the patients currently eligible for conventional fractionated radiotherapy in the United States were treated instead with stereotactic body radiotherapy, this would result in a total cost savings of US$250 million per year. There is also a strong radiobiological rationale to support its use, with prostate cancer believed to have a low α/β ratio and therefore being preferentially sensitive to larger fraction sizes. To date, there are no published randomized trials reporting on the comparative efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy compared to alternative treatment modalities, although multiple randomized trials are currently accruing. Yet, early results from the randomized phase III study of HYPOfractionated RadioTherapy of intermediate risk localized Prostate Cancer (HYPO-RT-PC) trial, as well as multiple single-arm phase I/II trials, indicate low rates of late adverse effects with this approach. In patients with low- to intermediate-risk disease, excellent biochemical relapse-free survival outcomes have been reported, albeit with relatively short median follow-up times. These promising early results, coupled with the enormous potential cost savings and implications for resource availability, suggest that stereotactic body radiotherapy will take center stage in the treatment of prostate cancer in the years to come.""","""['Gargi Kothari', 'Andrew Loblaw', 'Alison C Tree', 'Nicholas J van As', 'Drew Moghanaki', 'Simon S Lo', 'Piet Ost', 'Shankar Siva']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: When and for Whom?', '""Give me five"" ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: non-invasive ablative approach.', 'Phase 2 Multicenter Trial of Heterogeneous-dosing Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Low- and Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer: 5-year Outcomes.', 'Regarding: Rosenthal DI, Glatstein E.

However, high-quality biological variation (BV) estimates for PSA are scarce. Here BV estimates from the European Biological Variation Study (EuBIVAS) for total (tPSA), free (fPSA), conjugated PSA (cPSA), and percent free PSA (%fPSA) are provided.  Method:   EuBIVAS samples were collected weekly from thirty-seven healthy males (22-59 years) for 10 weeks. All samples, stored at -80 °C, were measured in duplicate with a Roche Cobas e801. Outlier and homogeneity analysis were performed followed by CV-ANOVA to determine BV, analytical variation, analytical performance specifications (APS), reference change values (RCV) and the number of samples required to estimate the homeostatic set points.  Results:   Within-subject BV estimates were for tPSA 6.8% (6.1-7.4); fPSA 7.1% (6.5-7.7) cPSA: 8.8% (8.0-9.7) and %fPSA 5.3% (4.8-5.8), delivering RCV for increase of 15-20% and indicating that one sample is sufficient to estimate the homeostatic set points within ±15%. BV estimates for tPSA were lower than previously published estimates. Estimates for fPSA, cPSA and %fPSA have not previously been reported in healthy subjects.

Materials and Methods This single-institution study included 316 men (mean age ± standard deviation, 64.0 years ± 7.8) with an indication for MRI-transrectal US fusion biopsy between May 2015 and September 2016 (training cohort, 183 patients; test cohort, 133 patients). Lesions identified by prospective clinical readings were manually segmented for mean ADC and radiomics analysis. Global and zone-specific random forest RML and mean ADC models for classification of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason grade group ≥ 2) were developed on the training set and the fixed models tested on an independent test set. Clinical readings, mean ADC, and radiomics were compared by using the McNemar test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results In the test set, radiologist interpretation had a per-lesion sensitivity of 88% (53 of 60) and specificity of 50% (79 of 159). Quantitative measurement of the mean ADC (cut-off 732 mm2/sec) significantly reduced false-positive (FP) lesions from 80 to 60 (specificity 62% [99 of 159]) and false-negative (FN) lesions from seven to six (sensitivity 90% [54 of 60]) (P = .048). Radiologist interpretation had a per-patient sensitivity of 89% (40 of 45) and specificity of 43% (38 of 88). Quantitative measurement of the mean ADC reduced the number of patients with FP lesions from 50 to 43 (specificity 51% [45 of 88]) and the number of patients with FN lesions from five to three (sensitivity 93% [42 of 45]) (P = .496).

For patients with RRP performed between 2005 and 2014, predictive and pathologic prognostic factors were assessed. Initially all and D'Amico intermediate-risk group patients were comparatively assessed in terms of being T2 or T3 stage on RRP pathology, positive or negative for PNI presence on PNB and positive or negative BR situation. Additionally the effect of PNI presence on recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was investigated. When all patients are investigated, multivariate analysis observed that in T3 patients PSA, PNB Gleason score (GS) and tumor percentage were significantly higher; in PNI positive patients PNB GS, core number and tumor percentage were significantly higher and in BR positive patients PNB PNI positivity and core number were significantly higher compared to T2, PNI negative and BR negative patients, separately (p < 0.05). When D'Amico intermediate-risk patients are evaluated, for T3 patients PSA and PNB tumor percentage; for PNI positive patients PNB core number and tumor percentage; and for BR positive patients PNB PNI positivity were significantly higher compared to T2, PNI negative and BR negative patients, separately (p < 0.05). Mean RFS in the whole patient group was 56.4 ± 4.2 months for PNI positive and 96.1 ± 5.7 months for negative groups.

The trend between volumes of robotic surgery for each organ site was analyzed using the Cochran-Armitage test. Multivariable models were then created to determine independent predictors of robotic surgery within each organ site by calculating the odds ratio with 95% CI. Among the 566,399 surgical cases analyzed, 35.1% were performed using robot assistance. Institutions whose robotic prostatectomy volume was in the top 75 percentile compared to the bottom 25 percentile performed a larger percentage of robotic surgery on the following sites: kidney 32.6 vs. 28.8%, bladder 23.6 vs. 18.6%, uterus 52.5 vs. 47.7%, cervix 43.5 vs. 39.2%, colon 3.2 vs. 2.9%, rectum 10.7 vs. 8.9%, and lung 7.3 vs. 6.8% (all p < 0.0001).

We evaluated the uptake of 111In-labelled PSMA ligand DKFZ-617 (referred to as 111In-PSMA-617) in unaffected LN and LNM at the level of single LN.  Methods:   Six patients with prostate cancer (PCa) with suspicion of LNM on preoperative PSMA PET/CT underwent 111In-PSMA-617-guided lymphadenectomy (LA; four salvage LA and two primary LA). 111In-PSMA-617 (109 ± 5 MBq). was injected Intravenously 48 h prior to surgery Template LAs were performed in small subregions: common, external, obturator and internal iliac vessels, and presacral and retroperitoneal subregions (n = 4). Samples from each subregion were isolated aiming at the level of single LN. Uptake was measured ex situ using a germanium detector. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed based on 111In-PSMA-617 uptake expressed as standardized uptake values normalized to lean body mass (SUL).  Results:   Overall 310 LN (mean 52 ± 19.7) were removed from 74 subregions (mean 12 ± 3.7). Of the 310 LN, 35 turned out to be LNM on histopathology. Separation of the samples from all subregions resulted in 318 single specimens: 182 PCa-negative LN samples with 275 LN, 35 single LNM samples, 3 non-nodal PCa tissue samples and 98 fibrofatty tissue samples. The median SULs of nonaffected LN (0.16) and affected LN (13.2) were significantly different (p < 0.0001). Based on 38 tumour-containing and 182 tumour-free specimens, ROC analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.976 (95% CI 0.95-1.00, p < 0.0001). Using a SUL cut-off value of 1.136, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy in discriminating affected from nonaffected LN were 92.1% (35/38), 98.9% (180/182), 94.6% (35/37), 98.4% (180/183) and 97.7% (215/220), respectively.  Conclusion:   Ex situ analysis at the level of single LN showed that 111In-PSMA-617 had excellent ability to discriminate between affected and nonaffected LN in our patients with PCa.

Therefore, little is known on prevalence and prognosis of these patients.  Methods:   1252 patients diagnosed with NSCLC in our center from 2006 to 2017 were studied. Overall survival (OS) of patients with a prior or synchronous malignancy was compared to controls including case-control analysis.  Results:   158 patients (12.6%) had a prior malignancy. The most common sites were prostate (17%), breast (16%), gastrointestinal tract (12%), head and neck (11%), bladder (10%), and lung (8%). Compared to controls, patients with prior malignancy were older (71.3 vs. 67.5 years), but had otherwise better prognostic characteristics (stage I-III 63 vs. 53%). Survival was identical compared to controls [hazard ratio (HR) 1.017, CI 0.776-1.333]. A further 3.5% of patients had a synchronous malignancy including 34% prior lung cancer. Patients with a synchronous malignancy had an earlier stage (I-III 84%), and had longer median OS in unselected patients (38.6 vs. 16.2 months, p = 0.021). However, the case-control analysis showed similar OS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.899, CI 0.497-1.621].  Conclusions:   Prior or synchronous second malignancies are common at diagnosis of NSCLC. The sites reflect the high proportion of smokers in the population. The earlier stage of NSCLC with a second malignancy might be attributed to chance finding of NSCLC during follow-up. The second malignancy does not affect OS of NSCLC.

Prostate biopsies showed foci of prostate cancer with Gleason score 7 (3+4) (grade grope 2) involving 10% of two cores. Through work up for treatment of the prostate cancer, he was found to have focal thickening of his sigmoid colon with adjacent lymphadenopathy in CT scans. Colon biopsy showed a tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia and deep invasive carcinoma could not be excluded. A low anterior resection of the rectosigmoid colon was performed and a sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma (pT2N1b, AJCC 8th edition) was confirmed. Immunostaining showed that the colon cancer was positive for CDX2, SATB2, had a loss of PMS2 and intact expression of MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6, negative for AMACR, while the prostate cancer was positive for AMACR, had intact expression of PMS2, MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6, and negative for CDX2 and SATB2. MSI-H phenotype and PMS2 mutation in the colon cancer were confirmed by microsatellite instability (MSI) PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS), respectively. Through genetic counseling and analysis of the family pedigree, LS was confirmed with colon cancer present in multiple maternal family members and his brother also had metachronous colon and prostate cancers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of synchronous colon and prostate cancers, with isolated PMS2 loss present in the colon cancer while intact DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein expressions present in the prostate cancer, in the English literature.

An interesting area of study is to determine which risk factors may be used as predictors of more aggressive PCa behavior in patients with biochemical failure. The aim of this study was to determine prognostic factors in patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure after undergoing brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   Between 1990 and 2015, 2771 patients with localized PCa underwent treatment at our institution treated by a single radiation oncologist with low-dose-rate brachytherapy as a component of definitive radiation therapy. Disease-specific survival (DSS), distant metastases (DM), and overall survival were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was also performed.  Results:   In this group, 2126 patients (89%) had no evidence of PSA failure. Of the 251 of patients that did have biochemical failure, 115 (45.8%), 58 (23.1%), 78 (31.1%) had a PSA doubling time (PSADT) of <6 months, 6-12 months, and >12 months, respectively. Doubling time was associated with a statistically significant impact on DSS and DM but not overall survival, which appears to be dominated by initial age at diagnosis as well as stage.  Conclusions:   We have shown here that PSADT predicts for DSS and freedom from DM in our large prospectively followed cohort. Given the variable trajectory of metastatic and recurrent PCa, strong prognostic factors such as PSADT may be able to select a group of patients who benefit from earlier or escalated systemic therapies such as androgen deprivation or cytotoxic chemotherapy.""","""['Lucas Resende Salgado', 'Ryan Rhome', 'William Oh', 'Nelson Stone', 'Richard Stock']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Prostate-specific antigen doubling time predicts clinical outcome and survival in prostate cancer patients treated with combined radiation and hormone therapy.', 'Salvage brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiation therapy: A comparison of low-dose-rate and high-dose-rate brachytherapy and the importance of prostate-specific antigen doubling time.', 'Distant and local recurrence in patients with biochemical failure after prostate brachytherapy.', 'Prostate-specific antigen doubling time and survival in patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer.', 'High-dose rate brachytherapy--the Charité experience.']"""

The goal of MSTS is to improve the quality of life of the patients with spinal metastases and rarely for oncological control which is usually achieved by adjuvant therapies. Hence outcome measures such as length of stay (LOS) and rate of complications after MSTS are important indicators of quality but there is limited literature evidence for the same. We carried out a retrospective study to determine the incidence and the factors influencing normal (nLOS) and extended length of stay (eLOS) after MSTS. Data of 220 consecutive patients who underwent MSTS between 2005 and 2015 were retrieved from hospital electronic records. The preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative variables, discharge destinations as well as socioeconomic factors were analyzed. eLOS defined as positive when the LOS exceeded the 75th percentile for this cohort, was the key outcome indicator. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the predictive factors of eLOS. The overall median LOS was 7 days (1-30 days) and 55 patients had eLOS (LOS ≥ 11 days). Multivariate analysis revealed that significant variables independently associated with eLOS were instrumentation >9 spinal segmental levels (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.1-7.5, p = 0.032) and presence of postoperative complications (OR 3.68, 95% CI 1.85-7.30, p < 0.001).

Design:   Propensity score-matched retrospective cohort study using Medicare claims data.  Data source:   National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program-Medicare linked database.  Patients:   A total of 201,797 patients 66 years or older who were diagnosed with any stage of prostate cancer between 1992 and 2009; of these, 94,528 patients received ADT; 107,269 patients did not.  Measurements and main results:   We identified receipt of ADT and number of claims for ADT, and ascertained the long-term treatment-related side effects that occurred during 19 years of follow-up, from 1992-2010, from Medicare claims data. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the incidences and hazard ratios (HRs) of newly developed side effects. Among all potential long-term side effects, the risk of bone fractures was highest (HR 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-1.43), followed by diabetes (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.18-1.24), dementia (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.13-1.20), coronary heart disease (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.09-1.14), and acute MI (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.08-1.15) in those who received ADT compared with those who did not. The HRs for bone fractures and diabetes increased steadily as the number of ADT doses increased, indicating a linear trend in the dose-response relationship. Compared with patients who received active surveillance, ADT was associated with a 12% increased risk of sexual dysfunction (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.20). The HR for sexual dysfunction increased to 1.68 (95% CI 1.59-1.77) when ADT was combined with radiation therapy and to 3.54 (95% CI 3.26-3.85) when ADT was combined with radiation and surgery.

These residual microtumors cause lethal recurrence and metastasis. Herein, we show a crucial example of Raman imaging with gap-enhanced Raman tags (GERTs) to serve as a robust platform for intraoperative detection and eradication of residual microscopic foci, which exist in surgical margins, tumor invasion, and multifocal tumor spread. The GERTs feature gap-enhanced gold core-shell nanostructures, with Raman reporters embedding inside the interior gap junction. This nanostructure elicits highly sensitive and photostable Raman signals for microtumor detection by applying a 785 nm, low-energy laser and produces hyperthermia effects for microtumor ablation upon switching a 808 nm, high-power laser. In the orthotopic prostate metastasis tumor model, systematic delivery of GERTs enabled precise imaging and real-time ablation of macroscopic malignant lesions around the surgical bed without damaging normal tissues. Consequently, the GERTs-based surgery prevented local recurrence and delivered 100% tumor-free survival.

Materials and methods:   X-ray fluorescence based technique(namely Synchrotron Induced X-ray Emission (SRIXE)) is described in terms of methodology, sample preparation and the evaluation of the recorded results (spectral data sets). Materials for the samples were collected from the patients underwent radical prostatectomy due to Adenocarcinoma prostatae. Specimens were freeze-dried, cut by microtome (to the thickness of 15 μm), one slice was placed on Mylar foil (for SRIXE measurements) and adjacent one on microscopic glass (for histopathological assessment).  Results:   Results presented here show the usability of SRIXE method for the evaluation of concentration of trace and essential elements in prostate tissue sections with the spatial resolution better than 15 microns.  Discussion:   Histopathological analysis of samples, which is only focused on morphological features, is unable to reveal information about changes in biochemical signature of tissues affected by the illness. SRIXE is a powerful and promising technique to analyse even very low concentrations oat the cellular level without any labelling or separating procedures. Obtained results may be correlated with classic histopathological assessment allowing for drawing conclusions on the changes in certain elements concentrations with the progression of disease.

Much progress has been made in recent years to understand the underlying genetic basis that drives prostate cancer. Such mechanistic information is useful for development of novel therapeutic targets, to identify biomarkers for early detection or to distinguish between aggressive and indolent disease, and to predict treatment outcome. Multiple tests have become available in recent years to address these clinical needs for prostate cancer. We describe several of these assays, summarizing test details, performance characteristics, and acknowledging their limitations. There is a pressing unmet need for novel biomarkers that can demonstrate improvement in these areas. We introduce one such candidate biomarker, RAD9, describe its functions in the DNA damage response, and detail why it can potentially fill this void. RAD9 has multiple roles in prostate carcinogenesis, making it potentially useful as a clinical tool for men with prostate cancer. RAD9 was originally identified as a radioresistance gene, and subsequent investigations revealed several key functions in the response of cells to DNA damage, including involvement in cell cycle checkpoint control, at least five DNA repair pathways, and apoptosis. Further studies indicated aberrant overexpression in approximately 45% of prostate tumors, with a strong correlation between RAD9 abundance and cancer stage. A causal relationship between RAD9 and prostate cancer was first demonstrated using a mouse model, where tumorigenicity of human prostate cancer cells after subcutaneous injection into nude mice was diminished when RNA interference was used to reduce the normally high levels of the protein. In addition to activity needed for the initial development of tumors, cell culture studies indicated roles for RAD9 in promoting prostate cancer progression by controlling cell migration and invasion through regulation of ITGB1 protein levels, and anoikis resistance by modulating AKT activation. Furthermore, RAD9 enhances the resistance of human prostate cancer cells to radiation in part by regulating ITGB1 protein abundance. RAD9 binds androgen receptor and inhibits androgen-induced androgen receptor's activity as a transcription factor. Moreover, RAD9 also acts as a gene-specific transcription factor, through binding p53 consensus sequences at target gene promoters, and this likely contributes to its oncogenic activity. Given these diverse and extensive activities, RAD9 plays important roles in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer and can potentially serve as a valuable biomarker useful in the management of patients with this disease.""","""['Howard B Lieberman', 'Alex J Rai', 'Richard A Friedman', 'Kevin M Hopkins', 'Constantinos G Broustas']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Transl Cancer Res""","""['Rad9 protein contributes to prostate tumor progression by promoting cell migration and anoikis resistance.', 'Rad9 has a functional role in human prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Regulation of NEIL1 protein abundance by RAD9 is important for efficient base excision repair.', 'Contributions of Rad9 to tumorigenesis.', 'The role of RAD9 in tumorigenesis.', 'Hypermethylation of RAD9A intron 2 in childhood cancer patients, leukemia and tumor cell lines suggest a role for oncogenic transformation.', 'Detection and Investigation of Extracellular Vesicles in Serum and Urine Supernatant of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Clinical proteomics for prostate cancer: understanding prostate cancer pathology and protein biomarkers for improved disease management.', 'DNMT1 and DNMT3B regulate tumorigenicity of human prostate cancer cells by controlling RAD9 expression through targeted methylation.', 'Pseudouridine as a novel biomarker in prostate cancer.']"""

Here, we identify a binding interaction between ERG and the mammalian SWI/SNF (BAF) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, which is conserved among other oncogenic ETS factors, including ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5. We find that ERG drives genome-wide retargeting of BAF complexes in a manner dependent on binding of ERG to the ETS DNA motif. Moreover, ERG requires intact BAF complexes for chromatin occupancy and BAF complex ATPase activity for target gene regulation. In a prostate organoid model, BAF complexes are required for ERG-mediated basal-to-luminal transition, a hallmark of ERG activity in prostate cancer.

Aim:   Overview and comparison of previous and present diagnostic and therapeutic methods regarding accuracy of diagnosis, improvement of efficiency and decrease of toxicities. We also aimed to explore general correlations in case of serious complications.  Method:   By the help of two prostate cancer patients we demonstrate the importance of accuracy and change of histological diagnosis, significance of proper imaging techniques, and also show parameters of conventional and modern radiotherapy and their acute and chronic complications. Differences of previous and present methods and their consequences were analyzed.  Results:   By now, histological findings in the patients' diagnosis have changed. Both patients received conventional three-dimensional definitive radiotherapy in 2009-2011, and their prostate cancer was cured. In one case, urinary bladder also received radiotherapy because prostate carcinoma had infiltrated it. In the other case, the contemporary radiotherapy involved urinary bladder's fundus due to safety margins. Although acute grade 2 cystitis developed in both cases and recovered in several weeks, as late complication bladder shrinkage developed, which after the ineffectiveness of conventional therapies had to be cured by radical cystoprostatectomy - in order to cease bleeding and to cure incontinence.  Conclusions:   In case of prostate carcinomas, serious complications can be avoided by the improvement of diagnostic and therapeutic options.

Previously, we showed that oxytocin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) effects on cell migration in prostate cancer cells require Giα2 protein. In the current study, we investigated the interactions among G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), Giα2, PI3-kinase, and Rac1 activation in the induction of migratory and invasive behavior by diverse stimuli. Knockdown and knockout of endogenous Giα2 in PC3 cells resulted in attenuation of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), oxytocin, SDF-1α, and EGF effects on cell migration and invasion. In addition, knockdown of Giα2 in E006AA cells attenuated cell migration and overexpression of Giα2 in LNCaP cells caused significant increase in basal and EGF-stimulated cell migration. Pretreatment of PC3 cells with Pertussis toxin resulted in attenuation of TGFβ1- and oxytocin-induced migratory behavior and PI3-kinase activation without affecting EGF-induced PI3-kinase activation and cell migration. Basal- and EGF-induced activation of Rac1 in PC3 and DU145 cells were not affected in cells after Giα2 knockdown. On the other hand, Giα2 knockdown abolished the migratory capability of PC3 cells overexpressing constitutively active Rac1. The knockdown or knockout of Giα2 resulted in impaired formation of lamellipodia at the leading edge of the migrating cells. We conclude that Giα2 protein acts at two different levels which are both dependent and independent of GPCR signaling to induce cell migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells and its action is downstream of PI3-kinase-AKT-Rac1 axis.""","""['Silvia Caggia', 'HimaBindu Chunduri', 'Ana C Millena', 'Jonathan N Perkins', 'Smrruthi V Venugopal', 'BaoHan T Vo', 'Chunliang Li', 'Yaping Tu', 'Shafiq A Khan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Differential roles and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complexes 1 and 2 during cell migration in prostate cancer cells.', 'The essential role of Giα2 in prostate cancer cell migration.', 'Differential role of PTEN in transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) effects on proliferation and migration in prostate cancer cells.', 'Expression of TGFβ3 and its effects on migratory and invasive behavior of prostate cancer cells: involvement of PI3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway.', 'Suppressing the formation of lipid raft-associated Rac1/PI3K/Akt signaling complexes by curcumin inhibits SDF-1α-induced invasion of human esophageal carcinoma cells.', 'Potential Role of CXCL13/CXCR5 Signaling in Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Treatment in Cancer.', 'Inhibition of histamine receptor H3 suppresses the growth and metastasis of human non-small cell lung cancer cells via inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK signaling pathways and blocking EMT.', 'Small Molecule Inhibitors Targeting Gαi2 Protein Attenuate Migration of Cancer Cells.', 'Update on GNA Alterations in Cancer: Implications for Uveal Melanoma Treatment.', 'Differential roles and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complexes 1 and 2 during cell migration in prostate cancer cells.']"""

Results:   Omitting DCE changed PI-RADS scores in 9.75% of patients, increasing the number of PI-RADS 3 scores by 8.89% when compared to mpMRI. No change of more than one score level was observed.

Variation across the normal range of circulating free testosterone concentrations may not lead to changes in prostate biology, unless circulating concentrations are low. This may also apply to prostate cancer risk, but this has not been investigated in an epidemiological setting.  Objective:   To examine whether men with low concentrations of circulating free testosterone have a reduced risk of prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Analysis of individual participant data from 20 prospective studies including 6933 prostate cancer cases, diagnosed on average 6.8 yr after blood collection, and 12 088 controls in the Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Odds ratios (ORs) of incident overall prostate cancer and subtypes by stage and grade, using conditional logistic regression, based on study-specific tenths of calculated free testosterone concentration.  Results and limitations:   Men in the lowest tenth of free testosterone concentration had a lower risk of overall prostate cancer (OR=0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.86; p<0.001) compared with men with higher concentrations (2nd-10th tenths of the distribution). Heterogeneity was present by tumour grade (phet=0.01), with a lower risk of low-grade disease (OR=0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.88) and a nonsignificantly higher risk of high-grade disease (OR=1.56, 95% CI 0.95-2.57). There was no evidence of heterogeneity by tumour stage. The observational design is a limitation.  Conclusions:   Men with low circulating free testosterone may have a lower risk of overall prostate cancer; this may be due to a direct biological effect, or detection bias. Further research is needed to explore the apparent differential association by tumour grade.  Patient summary:   In this study, we looked at circulating testosterone levels and risk of developing prostate cancer, finding that men with low testosterone had a lower risk of prostate cancer.""","""['Eleanor L Watts', 'Paul N Appleby', 'Aurora Perez-Cornago', 'H Bas Bueno-de-Mesquita', 'June M Chan', 'Chu Chen', 'Barbara A Cohn', 'Michael B Cook', 'Leon Flicker', 'Neal D Freedman', 'Graham G Giles', 'Edward Giovannucci', 'Randi E Gislefoss', 'Graeme J Hankey', 'Rudolf Kaaks', 'Paul Knekt', 'Laurence N Kolonel', 'Tatsuhiko Kubo', 'Loïc Le Marchand', 'Robert N Luben', 'Tapio Luostarinen', 'Satu Männistö', 'E Jeffrey Metter', 'Kazuya Mikami', 'Roger L Milne', 'Kotaro Ozasa', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'J Ramón Quirós', 'Harri Rissanen', 'Norie Sawada', 'Meir Stampfer', 'Frank Z Stanczyk', 'Pär Stattin', 'Akiko Tamakoshi', 'Catherine M Tangen', 'Ian M Thompson', 'Konstantinos K Tsilidis', 'Shoichiro Tsugane', 'Giske Ursin', 'Lars Vatten', 'Noel S Weiss', 'Bu B Yeap', 'Naomi E Allen', 'Timothy J Key', 'Ruth C Travis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Low Testosterone and Prostate Cancer: Is the Protection Real?', 'Circulating Folate and Vitamin B12 and Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Collaborative Analysis of Individual Participant Data from Six Cohorts Including 6875 Cases and 8104 Controls.', 'High levels of circulating testosterone are not associated with increased prostate cancer risk: a pooled prospective study.', 'Prospective study of sex hormone levels and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer risk in testosterone-treated men.', 'Physical activity for primary prevention of prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer screening has led to a significant proportion of men diagnosed with low-grade, low-stage prostate cancer who are now more likely to choose an active surveillance strategy rather than definitive treatments. Definitive treatment, such as surgery and radiation therapy, is useful for high-grade disease; however, because of the low long-term risk of progression of a low-grade disease and side effects of surgery and radiation, these treatments are less commonly used for low-grade disease. While five alpha reductase inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of cancer detection on subsequent biopsies for men on active surveillance, no medications have been proven to prevent progression to high-grade disease. mTOR pathways have long been known to influence prostate cancer and are targets in various prostate cancer patient populations. Low-dose mTOR inhibition with rapamycin has shown promise in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer and appear to affect cellular senescence and immunomodulation in the aging population.

Previously, we have demonstrated that 46% of UM express full-length LHRH receptors. This finding has led us to further examine the mechanism of action of LHRH receptor based targeted therapies in this malignancy.  Aims:   In the present study we investigated the cellular uptake of doxorubicin (DOX) and cytotoxic LHRH analog AN-152 (AEZS-108, zoptarelin doxorubicin) on human UM cell lines (OCM3) and its DOX resistant form OCM3DOX320 by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The LHRH receptor expression was characterized by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry.  Results:   We were able to establish a new, stable and DOX resistant human UM cell line OCM3DOX320. Our results demonstrated the expression of splice variants and isoforms of receptor for LHRH in OCM3 UM cell line and its doxorubicin resistant form OCM3DOX320. It has been revealed by MTT assay that AN-152 inhibited cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner in OCM3DOX320 cells. Furthermore, receptor-mediated uptake of AN-152 was demonstrated using confocal laser scanning microscopy in both cell line.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that the antiproliferative effect of AN-152 can be detected even if only LHRH receptor isoforms are expressed. Our study also demonstrates the LHRH receptor-mediated uptake of AN-152 in DOX resistant OCM3DOX320 cells. Our experiments provide new insights into a potential targeted therapy of UM and give further details about the accumulation of AN-152 in hormone-independent DOX-resistant cells expressing splice variants of the LHRH receptors.""","""['Gábor Oláh', 'Nikoletta Dobos', 'György Vámosi', 'Zsuzsanna Szabó', 'Éva Sipos', 'Klára Fodor', 'Kristóf Harda', 'Andrew V Schally', 'Gábor Halmos']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Pharm Sci""","""['The targeted LHRH analog AEZS-108 alters expression of genes related to angiogenesis and development of metastasis in uveal melanoma.', 'AEZS-108 : a targeted cytotoxic analog of LHRH for the treatment of cancers positive for LHRH receptors.', 'Receptor mediated antiproliferative effects of the cytotoxic LHRH agonist AN-152 in human ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines.', 'Triple negative breast cancers express receptors for LHRH and are potential therapeutic targets for cytotoxic LHRH-analogs, AEZS 108 and AEZS 125.', 'Targeting of cytotoxic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs to breast, ovarian, endometrial, and prostate cancers.', 'Is Uveal Melanoma a Hormonally Sensitive Cancer?

We compared various methods of Gleason pattern 4 quantification and evaluated associations with adverse pathology findings at radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   A total of 457 men with Grade Group 2 prostate cancer on biopsy subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution. Only patients with 12 or more reviewed cores were included in analysis. We evaluated 3 methods of quantifying Gleason pattern 4, including the maximum percent of Gleason pattern 4 in any single core, the overall percent of Gleason pattern 4 (Gleason pattern 4 mm/total cancer mm) and the total length of Gleason pattern 4 in mm across all cores. Adverse pathology features at radical prostatectomy were defined as Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 or greater (Grade Group 3 or greater), and any extraprostatic extension, seminal vesical invasion and/or lymph node metastasis. A training/test set approach and multivariable logistic regression were used to determine whether Gleason pattern 4 quantification methods could aid in predicting adverse pathology.  Results:   On multivariable analysis all Gleason pattern 4 quantification methods were significantly associated with an increased risk of adverse pathology (p <0.0001) and an increased AUC beyond the base model. The largest AUC increase was 0.044 for the total length of Gleason pattern 4 (AUC 0.728, 95% CI 0.663-0.793). Decision curve analysis demonstrated an increased clinical net benefit with the addition of Gleason pattern 4 quantification to the base model. The total length of Gleason pattern 4 clearly provided the largest net benefit.

We sought to determine the association of 5α-reductase inhibitor use with the risk of reclassification in the PASS (Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study).  Materials and methods:   Participants in the multicenter PASS were enrolled between 2008 and 2016. Study inclusion criteria were current or never 5α-reductase inhibitors use, Gleason score 3 + 4 or less prostate cancer at diagnosis, less than a 34% core involvement ratio at diagnosis and 1 or more surveillance biopsies. Included in study were 1,009 men, including 107 on 5α-reductase inhibitors and 902 who had never received 5α-reductase inhibitors. Reclassification was defined as increase in the Gleason score and/or an increase to 34% or greater in the ratio of biopsy cores positive for cancer. Adverse pathology at prostatectomy was defined as Gleason 4 + 3 or greater and/or nonorgan confined disease (pT3 or N1).  Results:   On multivariable analysis there was no difference in reclassification between men who had received and those who had never received 5α-reductase inhibitors (HR 0.81, p = 0.31).

These long transcripts play significant roles in diverse cellular processes, mostly through epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, dysregulation of lncRNAs is associated with various diseases, especially cancer. This study aims to investigate the probable roles of RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA in different cancers.  Methods:   Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was applied for the analysis of RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA amplification in gastric cancer (GC) samples compared with normal ones. Also, several online and offline data sets and tools were used to analyze the relation between RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA and different cancers.  Results:   The end result of our analyses indicated that RAB6C-AS1 was overexpressed in 40% of the investigated GC specimens. Also, the results demonstrated a true relation between RAB6C-AS1 overexpression and higher GC tumor grades. However, bioinformatic analyses showed that while RAB6C-AS1 possibly functions as an oncogene in some cancer types, including prostate and breast cancers, it might have a tumor suppressive function in some others including brain tumors.  Conclusions:   We found that RAB6C-AS1 lncRNA is mostly overexpressed in GC. Also, based on bioinformatic and systems biology analyses, RAB6C-AS1 might function either as an oncogenic factor or tumor suppressor in a tissue-specific manner. Thus, RAB6C-AS1 could be considered as a candidate biomarker for various malignancies, especially prostate and brain cancers.

Methods:   A total of 91 breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivor-spouse dyads were collected from the University Hospital Registry in Cleveland, Ohio. Standardized questions regarding PTG and health behaviors including eating and exercise were used. The actor-partner interdependence model with the use of structural equation modeling was utilized to analyze dyadic data.  Results:   Findings indicated that survivor actor effects of PTG on health behaviors were observed for survivors only. In the spiritual change and appreciation of life PTG models, the survivor or the spouse partner effects were observed, respectively. The spiritual change model produced the best fit of all of the other models, indicating both a survivor actor effect and survivor partner effect of spiritual change PTG on health behaviors. Thus, the relationships between PTG and health behavior at the dyadic level differed by five domains of PTG.

Materials and methods:   All patients who presented to our emergency department between January 2015 and March 2017 with urinary stones were prospectively included in this observational study and underwent DECT with subsequent interventional stone removal. Stone composition was analyzed using infrared spectrometry as the gold standard. Predictive accuracy of DECT and clinical covariates was computed by assessing univariate and multivariate areas under the curve (AUCs).  Results:   Of 84 patients with 144 urinary stones, 10 (11.9%) patients had UA stones according to infrared spectrometry, and the remaining stones were NUA or mixed stones. DECT had a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 98.5% for UA stones. The AUC for urine pH alone was 0.71 and 0.97 for DECT plus urine pH. No UA stones were found in patients with a urine pH above > 5.5. Mean DLP was 225.15 ± 128.60 mGy*cm and mean effective dose was 3.38 ± 1.93 mSv.

We have previously shown that the sonic hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway is oncogenic in CCC allowing us to identify the developmental Lim1 transcription factor as a Gli target and as a new oncogene in CCC regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, and promoting tumor growth. In this previous study, preliminary in vitro results also suggested that Lim1 may be implicated in metastatic spread. Here we investigated the potential pro-metastatic role of Lim1 in advanced CCC (1) in vitro using a panel of CCC cell lines expressing or not the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene either naturally or by gene transfer and (2) ex vivo in 30 CCC metastatic tissues, including lymph nodes, lung, skin, bone, and adrenal metastases, and (3) in vivo, using a metastatic model by intravenous injection of siRNA-transfected cells into Balb/c nude. Our in vitro results reveal that Lim1 knockdown time-dependently decreased CCC cell motility, migration, invasion, and clonogenicity by up to 50% regardless of their VHL status. Investigating the molecular machinery involved in these processes, we identified a large panel of Lim1 targets known to be involved in cell adhesion (paxillin and fibronectin), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Twist1/2 and snail), invasion (MMP1/2/3/8/9), and metastatic progression (CXCR4, SDF-1, and ANG-1). Importantly, Lim1 was found constitutively expressed in all metastatic tissues. The H-score in metastatic tissues being significantly superior to the score in the corresponding primary tumor tissues (P value = 0.009).

They rely heavily on NAD+ as a cofactor for multiple metabolic enzymes in anabolic and catabolic reactions. NAD+ also serves as a substrate for PARPs, sirtuins, and cyclic ADP-ribose synthases. Dysregulation of the cyclic ADP-ribose synthase CD38, the main NAD'ase in cells, is reported in multiple cancer types. This study demonstrates a novel connection between CD38, modulation of NAD+, and tumor cell metabolism in prostate cancer. CD38 expression inversely correlates with prostate cancer progression. Expressing CD38 in prostate cancer cells lowered intracellular NAD+, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and expression of p21Cip1 (CDKNA1). In parallel, CD38 diminishes glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and inhibits fatty acid and lipid synthesis. Pharmacologic inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) mimicked the metabolic consequences of CD38 expression, demonstrating similarity between CD38 expression and NAMPT inhibition. Modulation of NAD+ by CD38 also induces significant differential expression of the transcriptome, producing a gene expression signature indicative of a nonproliferative phenotype. Altogether, in the context of prostate cancer, the data establish a novel role for the CD38-NAD+ axis in the regulation of cell metabolism and development.Implications: This research establishes a mechanistic connection between CD38 and metabolic control. It also provides the foundation for the translation of agents that modulate NAD+ levels in cancer cells as therapeutics.

In this study, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of these two modalities in the treatment of intermediate-high risk prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   A multistate Markov model was created to model a patient with intermediate-high risk prostate cancer. The two treatment options modeled were (1) 23 fractions of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and two fractions of high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (brachytherapy boost) and (2) 44 fractions of IMRT (IMRT alone). Each patient received 1 year of hormone therapy, per the ASCENDE-RT protocol. Model assumptions, including clinical outcomes, toxicity, and utilities were derived from the medical literature. Costs of radiation therapy were estimated using Medicare reimbursement data.  Results:   The estimated expected lifetime cost of brachytherapy boost was $68,696, compared to $114,944 for IMRT alone. Brachytherapy boost significantly lowered expected lifetime treatment costs because it decreased the incidence of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, cutting the use of expensive targeted therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Brachytherapy boost had an expected quality-adjusted life years of 10.8 years, compared to 9.3 years for IMRT alone. One-way sensitivity analyses of our results found brachytherapy boost to be cost-effective over a wide range of cost, utility, and cancer progression rate assumptions.  Conclusions:   IMRT with high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost is a cost-effective treatment for intermediate-high risk prostate cancer compared to IMRT alone.""","""['Charles C Vu', 'Kevin G Blas', 'Thomas B Lanni', 'Gary S Gustafson', 'Daniel J Krauss']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Time-driven activity-based cost comparison of prostate cancer brachytherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Brachytherapy provides comparable outcomes and improved cost-effectiveness in the treatment of low/intermediate prostate cancer.', 'Radiation dose escalation for localized prostate cancer: intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus permanent transperineal brachytherapy.', 'Systematic review of the cost effectiveness of radiation therapy for prostate cancer from 2003 to 2013.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of intensity-modulated radiation therapy with normal and hypofractionated schemes for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Does the sequence of high-dose rate brachytherapy boost and IMRT for prostate cancer impact early toxicity outcomes?

An analysis of practice""","""Introduction:   Since Trousseau, we knows that venous thrombemboembolism (VTE) can reveal occult cancer. Different strategies of cancer screening have been evaluated: they are often time-consuming, cause stress and anxiety, and frequently require second-look examinations (due to the risk of false positives), with ultimately a very low yield (about 5%). We evaluated the number of suspect cancer tests before reporting them to the number of cancers finally diagnosed, after a VTE, in the setting of practice's analysis.  Methods:   We studied retrospectively patients hospitalized for a VTE and with a cancer screening, between 2011 and 2012. Screening cancer was defined by performing at least one of the following tests: PSA, fecal occult blood test, mammography, abdominopelvic iconography (abdominal ultrasound and/or abdominal CT scan). We recorded the suspected cancer tests, the cancers diagnosed, their stage and the survival. These results were expressed as a percentage with a 95% confidence interval.  Results:   Out of the 491 patients treated for a VTE, screening cancer was performed on 295 patients (median age 66.2 years). Nineteen PSA (16.7%, 95% CI [10.3-25]) were abnormal, with 2 localized prostate cancers. Nineteen fecal occult blood tests (15.3%, 95% CI [9.5-23]) were positive, with 2 local cancers. Five mammograms suspected cancer (4.7% 95% CI [1.6-10.8]) for one confirmed. Thirty-eight abdomino-pelvic iconographies (14.4% 95% CI [10.4-19.2]) were suspect, with 7 confirmed cancers, 6 being metastatic at times of diagnostic.  Conclusion:   Among the 607 tests performed, 81 were suspected of cancer (13.3%) for only 12 cancers confirmed (2.0%).

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess whether C-peptide serum concentrations are associated with increased prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   Several databases were searched to identify relevant original research articles published before November 2017. Random-effects models were used to summarize the overall estimate of the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   Nine observational studies involving 11,796 participants were identified. The findings of the meta-analysis indicated that the association between serum C-peptide concentration and prostate cancer was not significant (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.85-1.54; for highest versus lowest category C-peptide concentrations, P = .376). The associations were inconsistent, as indicated by subgroup analyses.  Conclusion:   Although our findings provided no support for the hypothesis that serum C-peptide concentration is associated with excess risk of prostate cancer, people must pay attention to this aspect and increase physical activity or modify dietary habits to constrain insulin secretion, which possibly lead to decreased incidence of prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   In this study, 598 men recruited in 2 national multicenter trials were analyzed. Information was recorded on comorbidity, previous abdominal surgery, use of drugs, and dose distribution. Fecal incontinence was prospectively evaluated through self-reported questionnaires. To develop the ANN, the study population was randomly split into training (n = 300), validation (n = 149), and test (n = 149) sets. Mean grade of longitudinal LFI (ie, expressed as the average incontinence grade over the first 3 years after radiation therapy) ≥1 was considered the endpoint. A suitable subset of variables able to better predict LFI was selected by simulating 100,000 ANN configurations. The search for the definitive ANN was then performed by varying the number of inputs and hidden neurons from 4 to 5 and from 1 to 9, respectively. A final classification model was established as the average of the best 5 among 500 ANNs with the same architecture. An ANN-based graphical method to compute LFI prediction was developed to include one continuous and n dichotomous variables.  Results:   An ANN architecture was selected, with 5 input variables (mean dose, previous abdominal surgery, use of anticoagulants, use of antihypertensive drugs, and use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy) and 4 hidden neurons. The developed classification model correctly identified patients with LFI with 80.8% sensitivity and 63.7% ± 1.0% specificity and an area under the curve of 0.78. The developed graphical tool may efficiently classify patients in low, intermediate, and high LFI risk classes.  Conclusions:   An ANN-based model was developed to predict LFI.

RSBT was used for planning target volume (PTV) dose escalation without increasing urethral dose for monotherapy, or for urethral sparing without decreasing PTV dose as a boost to external beam radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   Twenty-six patients were studied. PTV doses were expressed as equivalent dose delivered in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2), accounting for relative biological effectiveness (1.00 for 192Ir and 1.15 for 153Gd), dose protraction (114-minute repair half-time), and tumor dose response (α/β of 3.41 Gy). HDR-BT dose was prescribed such that 90% of the PTV received 110% of the prescription dose of 19 Gy for dose escalation and 15 Gy for urethral sparing, corresponding to EQD290% values (minimum EQD2 to the hottest 90% of the PTV) of 93.9 GyEQD2 and 60.7 GyEQD2, respectively. Twenty 90.95 GBq 153Gd RSBT sources and one 370 GBq 192Ir HDR-BT source were modeled.  Results:   For dose escalation with fresh sources, RSBT increased PTV EQD290% by 42.5% ± 8.4% (average ± standard deviation) without increasing urethral D10%, with treatment times of 216.8 ± 28.9 minutes versus 15.1 ± 2.1 minutes. After 1 half-life (240.4 days for 153Gd and 73.8 days for 192Ir), EQD290% increased 20.5% ± 9.1%. For urethral sparing with fresh sources, RSBT decreased urethral D10% by 26.0% ± 3.4% without decreasing PTV EQD290%, with treatment times of 133.6 ± 16.5 minutes versus 12.0 ± 1.7 minutes. After 1 half-life, urethral D10% decreased 20.2% ± 4.8%.  Conclusions:   RSBT can increase PTV EQD90% or decrease urethral D10% relative to HDR-BT at the cost of increased treatment time.

Methods:   We compared PCSG members (n = 441) with PC patients without support group experiences (n = 135) in a cross-sectional design. For this purpose, HL was operationalized through PC-specific knowledge, noncancer-specific knowledge about health care, guideline awareness, and skills needed to apply health information to meet own needs. Binary logistic regression models were calculated. Socio-demographic data and disease-related characteristics were used as control variables.  Results:   Knowledge about PC (OR, 2.2; CI, 1.3-3.7), the fact of having heard of guidelines (OR, 3.7; CI, 2.1-6.8) and having read one (OR, 5.1; CI, 2.8-9.4), and competencies regarding health service navigation (OR, 1.8; CI, 1.0-3.1) are associated with PCSG membership. No statistically significant associations could be found between PCSG membership and further skills questioned, as well as between membership and knowledge about noncancer-specific health care.  Conclusion:   PCSG membership is associated with HL in some areas only. In particular, the groups seem to provide an important platform for information exchange in the field of PC.

Aims:   The aim of the study was to correlate BMI, visceral adiposity index (VAI), and the plasmatic levels of leptin, adiponectin, and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and biomarkers of adipose tissue function, with the detection of Gleason patterns 4 and 5 at biopsy.  Subjects and methods:   Consecutive patients with prostate cancer at 12-core transrectal biopsy were enrolled. BMI, waist circumference (WC), blood samples to evaluate the plasmatic levels of triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), adiponectin, leptin, and MMP-3 were obtained immediately before biopsy. The VAI was calculated according to the formula: WC/(39.68 + [1.88 × BMI]) × TG/1.03 × 1.31/HDL.  Results:   One hundred and forty-nine patients were entered. The median PSA, BMI, and VAI were 10.0 ng/ml, 27.6 kg/m2, and 4.6, respectively. Gleason patterns 4 or 5 were detected in 68 (45.6%) patients; in 15 (41.7%), 31 (44.9%), and 22 (50.0%) among normal weight, overweight, and obese patients, respectively (P = 0.55). The statistical analysis did not show any significant correlation between BMI, VAI, the plasmatic levels of leptin, adiponectin, MMP-3, and the detection of Gleason patterns 4 and 5 at biopsy. A statistically significant association emerged with older age (P = 0.017) and higher PSA values (P = 0.02).

Although patients can benefit from enzalutamide at the beginning of this therapy, acquired enzalutamide resistance usually occurs within a short period. This motivated us to investigate the mechanism involved and possible approaches for overcoming enzalutamide resistance in CRPC. In the present study, we found that 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a crucial enzyme in the mevalonate pathway for sterol biosynthesis, is elevated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell lines. HMGCR knockdown could resensitize these cells to the drug, and HMGCR overexpression conferred resistance to it, suggesting that aberrant HMGCR expression is an important enzalutamide-resistance mechanism in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells were more sensitive to statins, which are HMGCR inhibitors. Of note, a combination of simvastatin and enzalutamide significantly inhibited the growth of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro and tumors in vivo Mechanistically, simvastatin decreased protein levels of the androgen receptor (AR), which was further reduced in combination with enzalutamide. We observed that the decrease in AR may occur through simvastatin-mediated inhibition of the mTOR pathway, whose activation was associated with increased HMGCR and AR expression. These results indicate that simvastatin enhances the efficacy of enzalutamide-based therapy, highlighting the therapeutic potential of statins to overcome enzalutamide resistance in CRPC.""","""['Yifan Kong', 'Lijun Cheng', 'Fengyi Mao', 'Zhuangzhuang Zhang', 'Yanquan Zhang', 'Elia Farah', 'Jacob Bosler', 'Yunfeng Bai', 'Nihal Ahmad', 'Shihuan Kuang', 'Lang Li', 'Xiaoqi Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of noncanonical Wnt pathway overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Understanding and overcoming the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Identification of key enzalutamide-resistance-related genes in castration-resistant prostate cancer and verification of RAD51 functions.', 'The role of lipid metabolic reprogramming in tumor microenvironment.', 'Key events in cancer: Dysregulation of SREBPs.', 'Targeting PKLR/MYCN/ROMO1 signaling suppresses neuroendocrine differentiation of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Comprehensive analysis of a glycolysis and cholesterol synthesis-related genes signature for predicting prognosis and immune landscape in osteosarcoma.']"""

This study aimed to compare hospitalizations for urosepsis within 1 month after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy between patients with adequate and traditional rectal preparations.  Materials and methods:   Between January 2011 and December 2016, a total of 510 patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound - guided prostate biopsy at our institutions and were orally administered prophylactic antibiotics (levofloxacin) were included. Two rectal preparations were performed: (1) adequate rectal preparation confirmed by digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasound (Group A, n = 310) and (2) traditional rectal preparation (Group B, n = 200). All patient characteristics were recorded. A logistic regression model was used to assess the effects of the two different rectal preparations on urosepsis, adjusted by patient characteristics.  Results:   There were a total of three and nine hospitalizations for urosepsis in Groups A and B, respectively. Differences in the demographic data between the two groups were insignificant. Logistic regression showed that adequate rectal preparation before biopsy significantly decreased the risk for urosepsis after biopsy (adjusted odds ratio: 0.2; 95% confidence interval: 0.05 - 0.78; P = 0.021).  Conclusions:   Adequate rectal preparation could significantly reduce hospitalizations for urosepsis within 1 month after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.

The PET / CT scan was divided into 18 sequences of 5 seconds each, followed by 9 sequences of 60 seconds each. Whole-mount sections of harvested prostates served as reference standards. Volumes of interest were positioned on the dynamic PET / CT images and the following quantitative variables were calculated: perfusion coefficient (K1), washout constant (K2), area under the curve (AUC) at 175 and 630 seconds, and average and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVavg, and SUVmax). Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to compare benign and cancerous areas of the prostate.  Results:   Areas of cancerous tissue were characterized by higher SUVavg and SUVmax than areas of benign tissue (3.67 ± 2.7 vs. 2.08 ± 1.3 and 5.91 ± 4.4 vs. 3.71 ± 3.7, respectively, P < 0.001), in addition to a higher K1 (0.95 ± 0.58 vs. 0.43 ± 0.24, P < 0.001) and greater cumulative tracer uptake, represented by the AUC at 175 and 630 seconds (P <0.001).

The encoder is built based upon densely connected layers that learn the high-level feature representation of the prostate. The decoder interprets the features and predicts the whole prostate volume by utilizing a residual layout and grouped convolution. A set of sub-volumes of MR images, centered at the prostate, is generated and fed into the proposed network for training purpose. The performance of the proposed network is compared to previously reported approaches.  Results:   Two independent datasets were employed to assess the proposed network. In quantitative evaluations, the proposed network achieved 95.11 and 89.01 Dice coefficients for the two datasets. The segmentation results were robust to variations in MR images. In comparison experiments, the segmentation performance of the proposed network was comparable to the previously reported approaches. In qualitative evaluations, the segmentation results by the proposed network were well matched to the ground truth provided by human experts.

P2X7 has a significant role in mediating diverse cell responses, which upon dysregulation are associated with tumour initiation and development. The rapid, ATP-mediated activation of P2X7 induces a fast-inward cation current in cells. However, prolonged ATP-mediated activation of P2X7 leads to formation of a pore that increases membrane permeability and eventually causes cell death. This presents a potential paradox, as the tumour microenvironment contains extracellular ATP at levels sufficient to activate the P2X7 pore and trigger cell death. However, P2X7 expression is associated with enhanced cancer cell survival, proliferation and metastatic potential. At least one distinct conformational form of P2X7, termed non-pore functional P2X7 (nfP2X7), has been described, which is not able to form a functional pore. We demonstrate for the first time in this study that exposure to a high ATP concentration, equivalent to those measured in the tumour microenvironment, drives nfP2X7 expression and also that nfP2X7 is essential for tumour cell survival. We show that monoclonal antibodies raised against a P2X7 amino acid sequence (200-216), whose conformation is distinct from that of wild-type (WT) P2X7, bind specifically to nfP2X7 expressed on the surface of tumour cells. We also show that nfP2X7 is broadly expressed in patient-derived tumour sections from a wide range of cancers. Therefore, antibodies raised against E200 provide tools that can differentiate between forms of the P2X7 receptor that have a key role in cancer.""","""['S M Gilbert', 'C J Oliphant', 'S Hassan', 'A L Peille', 'P Bronsert', 'S Falzoni', 'F Di Virgilio', 'S McNulty', 'R Lara']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Modulation of P2X4/P2X7/Pannexin-1 sensitivity to extracellular ATP via Ivermectin induces a non-apoptotic and inflammatory form of cancer cell death.', 'The second transmembrane domain of P2X7 contributes to dilated pore formation.', 'Structural basis for the functional properties of the P2X7 receptor for extracellular ATP.', 'Extracellular ATP and P2 purinergic signalling in the tumour microenvironment.', 'Understanding the roles of the P2X7 receptor in solid tumour progression and therapeutic perspectives.', 'Screening and validation of plasma cell-derived, purinergic, and calcium signalling-related genetic signature to predict prognosis and PD-L1/PD-1 blockade responses in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Untangling Macropore Formation and Current Facilitation in P2X7.', 'Cancer chemotherapy and beyond: Current status, drug candidates, associated risks and progress in targeted therapeutics.', 'Ectopic ATP synthase stimulates the secretion of extracellular vesicles in cancer cells.', 'Profiling of phosphorylated metabolites from lung cancer by zeolite loaded Mg-Al-Ce ternary hydroxide (Zeolite@MAC) composite.']"""

The purpose of this study was to assess the use of dose-escalated post-operative radiation (PORT) for prostate cancer in the United States, during a period in which there were no published level 1 studies on dose-escalation.  Methods:   We performed analyses on pT2-3, N0, M0 prostate cancer patients who received PORT after an R0-1 resection within the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), 2003-2012. We classified patients according to the use of high dose (>66.60 cGy) and very high dose (>70.20 cGy) radiation. We used regression analysis to assess the association of year of treatment with use of high and very high dose PORT. To demonstrate the potential of a registry-based network like the NCDB to prospectively monitor changes in radiation dosing patterns, we determined the year in which a significant change in dose could have been first detected had dose been actively monitored.  Results:   Between 2003 and 2012, the use of high dose PORT increased from 29.9% CI (26.7-33.1) to 63.5% CI (60.6-66.5) and very high dose PORT from 4.5% CI (3.1-5.9) to 10.8% CI (8.9-12.6) (adjusted p < 0.01, for both trends). Patients diagnosed at community centers were less likely to be treated with high dose PORT compared to those at academic or comprehensive centers (p < 0.01 for both comparisons). Had the NCDB network been prospectively monitoring PORT dose, significant increases in dose would have been detected as early as 2004 and after every year of the study period.  Conclusions:   The use of both high dose and very high dose PORT increased two-fold from 2003 to 2012 in the absence of randomized studies. This change in practice may be exposing patients to excess toxicity without cancer control benefits.

The cellular splicing factor 2/alternative splicing factor (SF2/ASF) is a positive regulator of gene expression, coded by a potent proto-oncogene, amplified, and abnormally expressed in tumors. TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is a DNA/RNA-binding protein, negative regulator of alternative splicing, known for causing neurodegeneration, and with complex roles in oncogenesis. We used the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology, with the Cas9 system from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9), to disrupt the HERV-K(HML-2)env gene, and evaluated the effects on cultured cells. The tool was tested on human prostate cancer LNCaP cells, whose HERV-Kenv transcription profile is known. It caused HERV-K(HML-2)env disruption (the first reported of a HERV gene), as evaluated by DNA sequencing, and inhibition of env transcripts and proteins. The HERV-K(HML-2)env disruption was found to interfere with important regulators of cell expression and proliferation, involved in manaling, RNA-binding, and alternative splicing, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), SF2/ASF, and TDP-43.

Factors such as genetic makeup and race play critical role in the outcome of therapies. This study was conducted to investigate the relevance of BMI1 in metastatic prostate cancer disease in Caucasian and African-Americans.  Experimental design:   We employed race-specific prostate cancer models, clinical specimens, clinical data mining, gene-microarray, transcription-reporter assay, chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP), IHC, transgenic-(tgfl/fl) zebrafish, and mouse metastasis models.  Results:   BMI1 expression was observed to be elevated in metastatic tumors (lymph nodes, lungs, bones, liver) of Caucasian and African-American prostate cancer patients. The comparative analysis of stage III/IV tumors showed an increased BMI1 expression in African-Americans than Caucasians. TCGA and NIH/GEO clinical data corroborated to our findings. We show that BMI1 expression (i) positively correlates to metastatic (MYC, VEGF, cyclin D1) and (ii) negative correlates to tumor suppressor (INKF4A/p16, PTEN) levels in tumors. The correlation was prominent in African-American tumors. We show that BMI1 regulates the transcriptional activation of MYC, VEGF, INKF4A/p16, and PTEN. We show the effect of pharmacological inhibition of BMI1 on the metastatic genome and invasiveness of tumor cells. Next, we show the anti-metastatic efficacy of BMI1-inhibitor in transgenic zebrafish and mouse metastasis models. Docetaxel as monotherapy has poor outcome on the growth of metastatic tumors. BMI1 inhibitor as an adjuvant improved the taxane therapy in race-based in vitro and in vivo models.  Conclusions:   BMI1, a major driver of metastasis, represents a promising therapeutic target for treating advanced prostate cancer in patients (including those belonging to high-risk group).""","""['Arsheed A Ganaie', 'Firdous H Beigh', 'Matteo Astone', 'Marina G Ferrari', 'Raihana Maqbool', 'Syed Umbreen', 'Aijaz S Parray', 'Hifzur R Siddique', 'Tabish Hussain', 'Paari Murugan', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Shahriar Koochekpour', 'Yibin Deng', 'Badrinath R Konety', 'Luke H Hoeppner', 'Mohammad Saleem']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['COMMD3:BMI1 Fusion and COMMD3 Protein Regulate C-MYC Transcription: Novel Therapeutic Target for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Essential role for activation of the Polycomb group (PcG) protein chromatin silencing pathway in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'BMI1, stem cell factor acting as novel serum-biomarker for Caucasian and African-American prostate cancer.', 'BMI1 and PTEN are key determinants of breast cancer therapy: A plausible therapeutic target in breast cancer.', 'Roles of BMI1 in the Initiation, Progression, and Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Hairy gene homolog increases nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell stemness by upregulating Bmi-1.', 'Signaling pathways in cancer metabolism: mechanisms and therapeutic targets.', 'Aldolase B attenuates clear cell renal cell carcinoma progression by inhibiting CtBP2.', 'LncRNA SNHG3 enhances BMI1 mRNA stability by binding and regulating c-MYC: Implications for the carcinogenic role of SNHG3 in bladder cancer.', 'Nomogram Predicts Risk and Prognostic Factors for Bone Metastasis of Pancreatic Cancer: A Population-Based Analysis.']"""

This is the first prospective study to investigate associations between α, β and γ HPV detection in the oral cavity and risk of esophageal cancer.Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study among 96,650 cancer-free participants in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Cohort and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Incident esophageal cancer cases (n = 125) were identified during an average 3.9 years of follow-up. Three controls per case (n = 372) were selected and matched on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and time since mouthwash collection. α, β, and γ HPV DNA in oral samples were detected using a next-generation sequencing assay. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate OR and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for smoking and alcohol consumption. Statistical significance was evaluated using permutation test.Results: Prevalence of oral α, β, and γ HPV was 18.4%, 64.8%, and 42.4% in cases and 14.3%, 55.1%, and 33.6% in controls, respectively. Oral HPV16 detection was not associated with esophageal cancer (OR = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.1-4.84) and none of the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases (n = 28) were HPV16 positive. Some oral HPV types were more common in cases than controls; however, none of the associations were statistically significant.Conclusions: Although HPVs in the oral cavity are very common, this study showed no evidence of association between oral HPVs and esophageal cancer.Impact: Oral HPVs may not contribute to risk of esophageal cancer.

The epigenetic mark 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) has recently been proposed as a novel candidate prognostic biomarker in several malignancies including PC. 5hmC is an oxidized derivative of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and can be further oxidized to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). The present study is the first to investigate the biomarker potential in PC for all four DNA methylation marks in parallel. Thus, we determined 5mC, 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC levels in non-malignant (NM) and PC tissue samples from a large radical prostatectomy (RP) patient cohort (n = 546) by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of serial sections of a tissue microarray. Possible associations between methylation marks, routine clinicopathological parameters, ERG status, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP were investigated.  Results:   5mC and 5hmC levels were significantly reduced in PC compared to NM prostate tissue samples (p ≤ 0.027) due to a global loss of both marks specifically in ERG- PCs. 5fC levels were significantly increased in ERG+ PCs (p = 0.004), whereas 5caC levels were elevated in both ERG- and ERG+ PCs compared with NM prostate tissue samples (p ≤ 0.019). Positive correlations were observed between 5mC, 5fC, and 5caC levels in both NM and PC tissues (p < 0.001), while 5hmC levels were only weakly positively correlated to 5mC in the PC subset (p = 0.030). There were no significant associations between 5mC, 5fC, or ERG status and time to BCR in this RP cohort. In contrast, high 5hmC levels were associated with BCR in ERG- PCs (p = 0.043), while high 5caC levels were associated with favorable prognosis in ERG+ PCs (p = 0.011) and were borderline significantly associated with worse prognosis in ERG- PCs (p = 0.058). Moreover, a combined high-5hmC/high-5caC score was a significant adverse predictor of post-operative BCR beyond routine clinicopathological variables in ERG- PCs (hazard ratio 3.18 (1.54-6.56), p = 0.002, multivariate Cox regression).

Objective:   To investigate the association between IgE levels and diagnosis of malignancy in non-institution-associated patients using the 2005-2006 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohort.  Methods:   All individuals with available IgE levels and known prior diagnosis of malignancy were divided into 4 groups: IgE deficient (IgE, <2.5 kU/L), normal IgE levels (2.5-100 kU/L), high IgE levels (100-1,000 kU/L), and very high IgE levels (≥1,000 kU/L). Rates of malignancy were compared among groups.  Results:   Of 4,488 individuals with data on IgE levels and malignancy status, 7.4% had a prior diagnosis of cancer. The rate of prior malignancy was significantly higher in the IgE-deficient group (12.6%) compared with individuals with high (6.7%, P = .04) and very high IgE levels (5.3%, P = 0.04). In the IgE-deficient group, only 3 patients had a diagnosis of malignancy within 3 years of IgE measurement. A mean (SD) of 10.3 (9.6) years elapsed between the time of malignancy diagnosis and IgE collection time; therefore, active neoplasm or recent chemotherapy was less likely to explain the very low IgE levels. Types of malignancies in the IgE-deficiency group included breast cancer (n = 6), nonmelanoma or unknown skin cancer (n = 3), uterine cancer (n = 2), cervical cancer (n = 1), lung cancer (n = 1), prostate cancer (n = 1), and hematologic cancer (n = 1).

Materials and methods:   One hundred twenty patients with complete DK and MR images and diagnosis confirmed by prostate biopsy, including 67 patients with PCa and 53 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), were retrospectively analyzed. The patients with PCa were divided into a low-grade PCa group (Gleason score [GS] ≤ 3 + 3) and intermediate- and high-grade PCa group (GS ≥ 3 + 4). A DKI-derived parameter (i.e., apparent kurtosis coefficient [Kapp]) and a DWI-derived parameter (i.e., apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]) were fitted. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) test, t test, ROC curves, Delong test, and Spearman correlation were performed.  Results:   Ninety ROIs in 67 patients with PCa were drawn, including ROIs in 37 low-grade tumors and ROIs in 53 intermediate- and high-grade tumors. PCa and intermediate- and high-grade PCa had significantly lower ADC values and significantly higher Kapp values than BPH and low-grade PCa (p < 0.01 for all). The AUCs of Kapp were significantly lower than the AUCs of ADC in the diagnosis (0.947 vs 0.978, p < 0.001) and grading (0.689 vs 0.894, p = 0.008) of PCa. The AUCs of the combination of the two metrics were significantly higher than the AUCs of Kapp for the diagnosis (0.979 vs 0.947, p = 0.013) and grading (0.934 vs 0.689, p < 0.001) of PCa and were higher than the AUCs of ADC without significance between groups (both p > 0.05). The combination of the two metrics significantly increased the specificity in grading of PCa compared with Kapp alone (0.838 vs 0.730, p = 0.035).

Here, we describe the development and validation of a novel gene expression biomarker to identify androgen receptor (AR)-modulating chemicals using a pattern matching method. Androgen receptor biomarker genes were identified by their consistent expression after exposure to 4 AR agonists and 4 AR antagonists and included only those genes that were regulated by AR. The 51 gene biomarker was evaluated as a predictive tool using the fold-change, rank-based Running Fisher algorithm. Using 158 comparisons from cells treated with 95 chemicals, the biomarker gave balanced accuracies for prediction of AR activation or AR suppression of 97% or 98%, respectively. The biomarker correctly classified 16 out of the 17 AR reference antagonists including those that are ""weak"" and ""very weak"". Predictions based on microarray profiles from AR-positive LAPC-4 cells treated with 28 chemicals in antagonist mode were compared with those from an AR pathway model which used 11 in vitro HT assays. The balanced accuracy for suppression was 93%. Using our approach, we identified conditions in which AR was modulated in a large collection of microarray profiles from prostate cancer cell lines including (1) constitutively active mutants or knockdown of AR, (2) decreases in availability of androgens by castration or removal from media, and (3) exposure to chemical modulators that work through indirect mechanisms including suppression of AR expression.

Twenty-five patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) very low- to unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer were enrolled in this study from April 2014 to September 2015 to receive highly hypofractionated IMRT (without intraprostatic fiducial markers) delivering 54 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. Patients with intermediate-risk disease underwent neoadjuvant androgen suppression for 4-8 months. Twenty-four patients were treated with highly hypofractionated IMRT, and one was treated with conventionally fractionated IMRT because the dose constraint of the small bowel seemed difficult to achieve during the simulation. Seventeen percent had very low- or low-risk, 42% had favorable intermediate-risk, and 42% had unfavorable intermediate-risk disease according to NCCN guidelines. The median follow-up period was 31 months (range, 24-42 months). No Grade ≥3 acute toxicity was observed, and the incidence rates of Grade 2 acute genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were 21% and 4%, respectively. No Grade ≥2 late toxicity was observed. Biochemical relapse was observed in one patient at 15 months, and the biochemical relapse-free survival rate was 95.8% at 2 years. A prostate-specific antigen bounce of ≥0.4 ng/ml was observed in 11 patients (46%). The highly hypofractionated IMRT regimen is feasible in patients with localized prostate cancer and is more convenient than conventionally fractionated schedules for patients and health-care providers.""","""['Kiyonao Nakamura', 'Itaru Ikeda', 'Haruo Inokuchi', 'Kenji Takayama', 'Takahiro Inoue', 'Tomomi Kamba', 'Osamu Ogawa', 'Masahiro Hiraoka', 'Takashi Mizowaki']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Ten-Year Outcomes of Moderately Hypofractionated (70\xa0Gy in 28 fractions) Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Image Guided Hypofractionated Postprostatectomy Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Long-term Tumor Control and Late Toxicity in Patients with Prostate Cancer Receiving Hypofractionated (2.2 Gy) Soft-tissue-matched Image-guided Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'Rectal/urinary toxicity after hypofractionated vs conventional radiotherapy in low/intermediate risk localized prostate cancer: systematic review and meta analysis.']"""

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) + 49 AA polymorphism is known to be associated with CaCx. Current attempt is to use immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, i.e., blocking of CTLA-4 using a fully human monoclonal CTLA-4 antibody to disrupt its inhibitory signal. This allows the CTLs to destroy the cancer cells. There is no information available on the soluble level of CTLA-4 on which the immunotherapy is targeted. This is specifically in Indian population including cases with CaCx.  Objective:   The aim of this study is to evaluate the levels of soluble CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4) in human papillomavirus (HPV)-infected women with or without CaCx and their association with the polymorphism at CTLA-4 + 49 A/G and CTLA-4 -318 C/T genotypes.  Materials and methods:   This is an exploratory case-control study involving two groups of HPV-infected women, the cases were with invasive CaCx and the control group was women with the healthy cervix. sCTLA-4 levels were measured using ELISA in 92 CaCx cases and 57 HPV-positive women with the healthy cervix.  Results:   Both cases and controls have similar sCTLA-4 levels. Comparison of CTLA-4 + 49A/G and -318 C/T genotypes with sCTLA-4 levels among cases and control also did not show any statistically significant difference.

Apart from their relation with inflammation, the additional involvement of COX-2 enzyme with cancer activity was recently discovered. In some cancer types the level of COX-2 enzyme is increased indicating that this enzyme could be a suitable target for cancer therapy. Based on these findings, we have synthesized some new diflunisal thiosemicarbazides and 1,2,4-triazoles and tested them against androgen-independent prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3), colon carcinoma (HCT-116), human breast cancer (T47D), breast carcinoma (MCF7) and human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cell lines. Specifically, the diflunisal and thiosemicarbazide functionality are combined during the synthesis of original compounds anticipating a potency enhancement. Compounds 6, 10, 15 and 16 did not show cytotoxic effects for the HEK293 cell line. Among them, compounds 15 and 16 demonstrated anticancer activity for the breast cancer cell line T47D, whereas compounds 6 and 10 which are thiosemicarbazide derivatives displayed anti-tumourigenic activity against the PC-3 cell line, consistent with the literature. However, no activity was observed for the HCT-116 cancer cell line with the tested thiosemicarbazide derivatives. Only compound 16 displayed activity against the HCT-116 cell line. Therefore, it was speculated that the diflunisal and thiosemicarbazide functionalities potentiate anticancer activity on prostate cancer and the thiosemicarbazide functionality decreases the anticancer activity of diflunisal on colon cancer cell lines. In order to gain insight into the anticancer activity and COX-2 inhibition, molecular docking studies were carried out for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes utilizing the newly synthesized compounds 15, and 16. Both 15 and 16 showed high selectivity and affinity toward COX-2 isozyme over COX-1, which is in agreement with the experimental results.""","""['Göknil Pelin Coşkun', 'Teodora Djikic', 'Taha Bartu Hayal', 'Nezaket Türkel', 'Kemal Yelekçi', 'Fikrettin Şahin', 'Ş Güniz Küçükgüzel']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['New Ferrocene Compounds as Selective Cyclooxygenase (COX-2) Inhibitors: Design, Synthesis, Cytotoxicity and Enzyme-inhibitory Activity.', 'New 1,2,4-triazole/pyrazole hybrids linked to oxime moiety as nitric oxide donor celecoxib analogs: Synthesis, cyclooxygenase inhibition anti-inflammatory, ulcerogenicity, anti-proliferative activities, apoptosis, molecular modeling and nitric oxide release studies.', 'Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel diphenylthiazole-based cyclooxygenase inhibitors as potential anticancer agents.', 'Coumarins scaffolds as COX inhibitors.', 'Arylpropionic acid-derived NSAIDs: New insights on derivatization, anticancer activity and potential mechanism of action.', 'Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as a Target of Anticancer Agents: A Review of Novel Synthesized Scaffolds Having Anticancer and COX-2 Inhibitory Potentialities.', 'Diflunisal Derivatives as Modulators of ACMS Decarboxylase Targeting the Tryptophan-Kynurenine Pathway.', 'Chemistry and Biological Activities of 1,2,4-Triazolethiones-Antiviral and Anti-Infective Drugs.', 'Synthesis and Anthelmintic Activity of New Thiosemicarbazide Derivatives-A Preliminary Study.']"""

The development of novel therapeutic agents for this predominantly metabolic and biochemical disorder have been hampered by the lack of a practical pre-clinical model amenable to drug screening. Here, Drosophila melanogaster, an emerging model for kidney stone disease research, was adapted as a high-throughput functional drug screening platform independent of the multifactorial nature of mammalian nephrolithiasis. Through functional screening, the therapeutic potential of a novel compound commonly known as arbutin that specifically binds to oxalate, a key component of kidney calculi, was identified. Through isothermal titration calorimetry, high-performance liquid chromatography and atomic force microscopy, arbutin was determined to interact with calcium and oxalate in both free and bound states, disrupting crystal lattice structure, growth and crystallization. When used to treat patient urine samples, arbutin significantly abrogated calculus formation in vivo and outperformed potassium citrate in low pH urine conditions, owing to its oxalate-centric mode of action. The discovery of this novel antilithogenic compound via D. melanogaster, independent of a mammalian model, brings greater recognition to this platform, for which metabolic features are primary outcomes, underscoring the power of D. melanogaster as a high-throughput drug screening platform in similar disorders.

Prostate cancer is among the most heritable cancers, but few studies have investigated its association with familial breast cancer. The objective of this study is to investigate the extent to which familial breast or prostate cancer in first-degree relatives increases prostate cancer risk.

Multivariable risk stratification could also avoid unnecessary biopsies following multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).  Objective:   To construct MRI-ERSPC-RCs for the prediction of any- and high-grade (Gleason score ≥3 + 4) prostate cancer (PCa) in 12-core TRUS-Bx±MRI-targeted biopsy (MRI-TBx) by adding Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) and age as parameters to the ERSPC-RC3 (biopsy-naïve men) and ERSPC-RC4 (previously biopsied men).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 961 men received mpMRI and 12-core TRUS-Bx±MRI-TBx (in case of PI-RADS ≥3) in five institutions. Data of 504 biopsy-naïve and 457 previously biopsied men were used to adjust the ERSPC-RC3 and ERSPC-RC4.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Logistic regression models were constructed. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the original ERSPC-RCs and MRI-ERSPC-RCs (including PI-RADS and age) for any- and high-grade PCa were compared. Decision curve analysis was performed to assess the clinical utility of the MRI-ERSPC-RCs.  Results and limitations:   MRI-ERSPC-RC3 had a significantly higher AUC for high-grade PCa compared with the ERSPC-RC3: 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-0.88) versus 0.76 (95% CI 0.71-0.80, p<0.01). Similarly, MRI-ERSPC-RC4 had a higher AUC for high-grade PCa compared with the ERSPC-RC4: 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.89) versus 0.74 (95% CI 0.69-0.79, p<0.01). Unlike for the MRI-ERSPC-RC3, decision curve analysis showed clear net benefit of the MRI-ERSPC-RC4 at a high-grade PCa risk threshold of ≥5%. Using a ≥10% high-grade PCa risk threshold to biopsy for the MRI-ERSPC-RC4, 36% biopsies are saved, missing low- and high-grade PCa, respectively, in 15% and 4% of men who are not biopsied.  Conclusions:   We adjusted the ERSPC-RCs for the prediction of any- and high-grade PCa in 12-core TRUS-Bx±MRI-TBx.

These options are best weighed in a process of shared decision-making with the patient's healthcare team. Minority men experience disparities in prostate cancer outcomes, possibly due in part to a lack of optimal communication during treatment selection. Decision aids facilitate shared decision-making, improve knowledge of treatment options, may increase satisfaction with treatment choice, and likely facilitate long-term quality of life.  Methods/design:   This study will compare the effect of two evidence-based decision aids on patient knowledge and on quality of life measured one year after treatment, oversampling minority men. One decision aid will be administered prior to specialist consultation, preparing patients for a treatment discussion. The other decision aid will be administered within the consultation to facilitate transparent, preference-sensitive, and evidence-informed deliberations. The study will utilize a four-arm, block-randomized design to test whether each decision aid alone (Arms 1 and 2) or in combination (Arm 3) can improve patient knowledge and quality of life compared to usual care (Arm 4). The study, funded by the National Cancer Institute's Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), will be deployed within select institutions that have demonstrated capacity to recruit minority populations into urologic oncology trials.

We performed DNA microarray analysis to analyze gene expression profiles in human endothelial cells exposed to 20, 40 and 60 μM endosulfan in combination with an endothelial phenotype. Microarray results showed that endosulfan increased the number of altered genes in a dose-dependent manner, and changed the expression of 161 genes across all treatment groups. qRT-PCR closely matched the microarray data for the genes tested. Significantly enriched biological processes for overlapping down-regulated genes include the neurological system process, signal transduction, and homeostatic process in all the dose groups. These down-regulated genes were associated with cytoskeleton organization and DNA repair at low doses, and involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, p53 pathway and carcinogenesis at high doses. Those up-regulated genes were linked to the inflammatory response and transcriptional misregulation in cancer at higher doses. These findings are consistent with our established endothelial phenotypes.

However, for some sites, this may not be strictly necessary and removing this constraint could theoretically improve organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing and tumor control probability (TCP). This study systematically investigates the consequences of PTV dose uniformity that results from the application or removal of an upper dose constraint (UDC) in the inverse planning process for prostate VMAT treatments. OAR sparing, target coverage, hotspots, and plan complexity were compared between prostate VMAT plans with and without the PTV UDC optimized using the progressive resolution optimizer (PRO, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Removing the PTV UDC, the median D1cc reached 144.6% for the CTV and the PTV, and an average increase of 3.2% TCP was demonstrated, while CTV and PTV coverage evaluated by D99% was decreased by less than 0.6% with statistical significance. Moreover, systematic improvement in the rectum dose volume histograms was shown (a 5-10% decrease in the volume receiving 50% to 75% prescribed dose), resulting in an average decrease of 1.3% (P < 0.01) in the rectum normal tissue complication probability. Additional consequences included potentially increased dose to the urethra as evaluated by PTV D0.035cc (median: 153.4%), delivering 283 extra monitor units (MUs), and slightly higher degrees of modulation. In general, the results were consistent when a different optimizer (Photon Optimizer, Varian Medical Systems) was used. In conclusion, removing the PTV UDC is acceptable for localized prostate cases given the systematic improvement of rectal dose and TCP. It can be particularly useful for cases that do not meet the rectum dose constraints with the PTV UDC on. This comes with the foreseeable consequences of increased dose heterogeneity in the PTV and an increase in MUs and plan complexity. It also has a higher requirement for reproducing the position and size of the target and OARs during treatment. Finally, with the PTV UDC completely removed, in some cases the maximum doses within the PTV did approach levels that may be of concern for urethral toxicity and therefore in clinical implementation it may still be necessary to include a PTV UDC, but one based on limiting toxicity rather than enforcing dose homogeneity.""","""['Lingyue Sun', 'Wendy Smith', 'Abhijit Ghose', 'Charles Kirkby']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric and radiobiological comparison of prostate VMAT plans optimized using the photon and progressive resolution algorithm.', 'Improving organ at risk sparing in oropharyngeal treatment planning by increasing target dose heterogeneity: A feasibility study.', 'Dose-volume and radiobiological dependence on the calculation grid size in prostate VMAT planning.', 'Dose-shaping using targeted sparse optimization.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Optimizing proton minibeam radiotherapy by interlacing and heterogeneous tumor dose on the basis of calculated clonogenic cell survival.', 'Simultaneous Integrated Boost Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Drug-Resistant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors: A Feasibility Study.', 'Automated treatment planning as a dose escalation strategy for stereotactic radiation therapy in pancreatic cancer.', 'A planning study of focal dose escalations to multiparametric MRI-defined dominant intraprostatic lesions in prostate proton radiation therapy.', 'Radiation treatment planning with embedded dose escalation.']"""

Materials and methods:   Among 93 patients treated with AA between January 2013 and April 2016 in our institution, 48 consecutive asymptomatic patients with mCRPC, who experienced biochemical progression on treatment with AA+P 10 mg/day, were included. A corticosteroid switch to AA+D 0.5 mg/day at PSA increase was administered until radiological and/or clinical progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free-survival (PFS). A prognostic score based on independent prognostic factors was defined.  Results:   The median time to PSA progression on AA+P was 8.94 months. The median PFS on AA+D and AA+corticosteroids (P then D) was 10.35 and 20.07 months, respectively. A total of 56.25% of patients showed a decrease or stabilization in PSA levels after the switch. In univariate analysis, three markers of switch efficiency were significantly associated with a longer PFS: long hormone-sensitivity duration (≥5 years; median PFS 16.62 vs 4.17 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.30, 90% confidence interval [CI] 0.16-0.56); low PSA level at the time of switch (<50 ng/mL; median PFS 15.21 vs 3.86 months, HR 0.33, 90% CI 0.18-0.60); and short time to PSA progression on AA+P (<6 months; median PFS 28.02 vs 6.65 months, HR 0.41 (90% CI 0.21-0.81).

AR signaling plays pivotal role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. However, the role of AR in penile cancer (PeCa) is poorly explored. Our previous molecular studies unveiled frequent AR mRNA loss in PeCa, which was further predicted as a major driver alteration in this neoplasm. Herein, we assessed the AR protein expression in 59 usual PeCa tissues and 42 surrounding normal tissues (SNT) by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray. In a paired analysis, we found a total absence of nuclear AR expression in PeCa while 95.2% of SNT samples presented strong nuclear AR expression (P < 0.001). Interestingly, 17 of 42 PeCa presented weak or moderate cytoplasmic AR staining, contrasting with 5 of 42 SNT (P = 0.008). Increased levels of AR cytoplasmic expression were related with poor prognosis features including advanced clinical staging (P = 0.044), compromised surgical margins (P = 0.005), and pathological inguinal node status (P = 0.047). Furthermore, AR cytoplasmic expression was also related with shorter overall survival (P = 0.032). In conclusion, the frequent loss of nuclear AR protein levels suggests a potential function in PeCa development. Based on this result, the androgen deprivation therapy is not indicated for PeCa patients. In addition, the AR cytoplasmic expression found in a significant number of cases (40.5%) showed prognostic value and pathways activated by the non-genomic AR signaling may represent a promising therapeutic strategy.""","""['Hellen Kuasne', 'Mateus C Barros-Filho', 'Fábio A Marchi', 'Sandra A Drigo', 'Cristovam Scapulatempo-Neto', 'Eliney F Faria', 'Silvia R Rogatto']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Virchows Arch""","""['Expression of androgen receptor and its phosphorylated forms in breast cancer progression.', 'Multidimensional integrative analysis uncovers driver candidates and biomarkers in penile carcinoma.', 'Integrative miRNA and mRNA analysis in penile carcinomas reveals markers and pathways with potential clinical impact.', 'Advances in Understanding of Penile Carcinogenesis: The Search for Actionable Targets.', 'Role of androgen receptor expression in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'P-Glycoprotein and Androgen Receptor Expression Reveals Independence of Canine Prostate Cancer from Androgen Hormone Stimulation.', 'Penile Cancer-Derived Cells Molecularly Characterized as Models to Guide Targeted Therapies.', 'Molecular and Functional Links between Neurodevelopmental Processes and Treatment-Induced Neuroendocrine Plasticity in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Understanding genomics and the immune environment of penile cancer to improve therapy.', 'Clinicopathological and prognostic significance of androgen receptor overexpression in colorectal cancer.

The new series of complexes has been investigated in vitro for their anti-cancer activities in PC-3 (prostate cancer) and T24 (bladder cancer) cell lines and in the non-cancerous MC3T3 (osteoblast) cell line. All tested complexes show high activities against the cancer cell lines with GI50 values lower than 500 nM. One complex (11) has been selected for further investigations.

This is likely because of the inability of retrospective studies to fully account for comorbidity differences across treatment groups because of the lack of detailed data in the registries. We use a unique population-based data set with detailed data regarding comorbidities and functional limitations to assess whether this can provide valid comparisons of survival across prostate cancer treatment groups.  Methods and materials:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) data set results from a linkage between the SEER database and the MHOS database, which includes detailed information regarding patient-reported comorbidity and functional limitations. We analyzed 3102 patients with prostate cancer in SEER-MHOS and used latent class analysis to identify the healthiest group with minimal comorbidity burden and functional limitations. Among the healthiest group, we examined overall survival across treatments using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Three distinct health groups were identified using latent class analysis; the healthiest group comprised 57% of the cohort and had a 10-year overall survival of 67%. Other health groups had higher rates of comorbidities or functional limitations. Among the healthiest group, 10-year overall survival differed across treatment groups: no local treatment (55%), external beam radiation therapy (69%), brachytherapy (76%), and radical prostatectomy (85%). Survival curves for the 3 treated groups separated at 4 years of follow-up.  Conclusions:   Despite the detailed health status information available in SEER-MHOS, our retrospective analysis could not fully account for patient selection biases across prostate cancer treatment groups. These findings highlight an important limitation of retrospective studies using population-based data sets and serve as a reminder to interpret results with caution.""","""['Kevin A Pearlstein', 'Ramsankar Basak', 'Ronald C Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Selection Bias in Population Registry-Based Comparative Effectiveness Research.', 'External Beam Radiotherapy Increases the Risk of Bladder Cancer When Compared with Radical Prostatectomy in Patients Affected by Prostate Cancer: A Population-based Analysis.', 'Radical Prostatectomy or External Beam Radiation Therapy vs No Local Therapy for Survival Benefit in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A SEER-Medicare Analysis.', 'Brachytherapy Boost Utilization and Survival in Unfavorable-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Survival and Complications Following Surgery and Radiation for Localized Prostate Cancer: An International Collaborative Review.', 'Permanent interstitial low-dose-rate brachytherapy for patients with localised prostate cancer: a systematic review of randomised and nonrandomised controlled clinical trials.', 'Racial and Ethnic Variations in Pre-Diagnosis Comorbidity Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life Among Older Women with Breast Cancer.', 'Human arginase I: a potential broad-spectrum anti-cancer agent.', 'Outcomes following radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation for veterans with Gleason 9 and 10 prostate cancer.', 'Survival after radical prostatectomy versus\xa0radiation therapy in clinical node-positive prostate cancer.', 'Effects of Radiation Therapy and Comorbidity on Health-Related Quality of Life and Mortality Among Older Women With Low-Risk Breast Cancer: Protocol for a Retrospective Cohort Study.']"""

We sought to evaluate the impact of prior local treatment to the prostate on the outcomes of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) patients recruited in the CHAARTED study.  Patients and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected data among patients with metastatic HSPC in the CHAARTED study, a phase 3 multicenter study conducted between 2006 and 2014. The CHAARTED study compared androgen deprivation therapy plus docetaxel versus androgen deprivation therapy alone among patients with metastatic HSPC. The main outcomes of the current analysis are overall survival, progression-free survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, and time to castration-resistant disease as assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank testing, and Cox regression models.  Results:   Kaplan-Meier overall survival estimates were produced according to whether patients underwent prior local treatment and results were stratified by treatment arm. For both treatment arms, patients with prior local treatment had better overall survival (P < .01). Similarly, Kaplan-Meier progression-free survival estimates were produced according to whether patients underwent prior local treatment, and results were stratified by the treatment arm. For both treatment arms, patients with prior local treatment had better progression-free survival (P < .01). In an adjusted Cox multivariate model (adjusted for assigned study treatment arm, age, baseline prostate-specific antigen, and baseline Gleason score, volume of the disease (low risk or high risk) and baseline performance status), patients with prior local treatment had better overall survival (P = .045), progression-free survival (P = .035), and cancer-specific survival (P = .010) compared to those without prior local treatment. Moreover, they had a longer time to development of castration-resistant disease (P = .025).  Conclusion:   Patients with metastatic HSPC and prior local treatment had better overall, progression-free, and cancer-specific survivals compared to those without prior local treatment.

However, the role of fenofibrate in prostate cancer (PCa) is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of fenofibrate in PCa cells. Firstly, fenofibrate treated PCa cells showed more apoptosis compared with the control group. Further, we found that fenofibrate induced autophagy but finally blocked its complete flux in PCa cells through regulating AMPK-mTOR pathway. The intermediate metabolite from uncompleted autophagy induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) via PERK and IRE1 signalings. In vivo mice model confirmed that fenofibrate inhibited the growth of PCa.

Although previous studies suggested that antimony might be a tumorigenic risk factor in several cancers, the molecular basis underlying antimony-mediated transformation remains unclear. Our results showed that the serum concentration of antimony was higher in prostate cancer specimens relative to that of benign prostate tissues, and this high serum concentration of antimony was closely associated with poorer outcome in prostate cancer patients. Additionally, we demonstrated that antimony could promote prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In order to gain insight into the potential mechanisms, we examined the effects of antimony exposure on downstream signaling that could contribute to tumor development. We found that low-dose antimony could regulate the expression of Ctbp2 by binding and regulating the activity of its MRE domain. Meanwhile, CtBP2 could transcriptionally regulate the expression of RhoC, which is a member of the RhoGTPase family. Subsequently, the kinase activity of ROCK1 is increased, which promotes the stability of oncogene c-Myc. Overall, our study demonstrated that antimony could enhance c-Myc protein stability and promote prostate cancer cell proliferation through activating CtBP2-ROCK1 signaling pathway. These findings also substantially highlighted the potential of targeting molecules within antimony induced CtBP2-c-Myc signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Changwen Zhang', 'Chao Lu', 'Zhen Wang', 'Guowei Feng', 'E Du', 'Yan Liu', 'Li Wang', 'Baomin Qiao', 'Yong Xu', 'Zhihong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Ecotoxicol Environ Saf""","""['CtBP2 could promote prostate cancer cell proliferation through c-Myc signaling.', 'The promotion on cell growth of androgen-dependent prostate cancer by antimony via mimicking androgen activity.', 'ROCK has a crucial role in regulating prostate tumor growth through interaction with c-Myc.', 'Down-regulation of C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2) inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion of human SHSY5Y cells in vitro.', 'Antimony exposure promotes bladder tumor cell growth by inhibiting PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy.', 'Response to Antimony Toxicity in Dittrichia viscosa Plants: ROS, NO, H2S, and the Antioxidant System.', 'Effects of Antimony on Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species (ROS and RNS) and Antioxidant Mechanisms in Tomato Plants.', 'Spatial patterns in prostate Cancer-specific mortality in Pennsylvania using Pennsylvania Cancer registry data, 2004-2014.', 'Strontium and antimony serum levels in healthy individuals living in high- and low-risk areas of esophageal cancer.']"""

We show that GFP-labeled αvβ3 derived from cancer cells circulates in the blood and is detected in distant lesions in NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. We, therefore, hypothesized that αvβ3 travels through exosomes and tested its levels in pools of vesicles, which we designate extracellular vesicles highly enriched in exosomes (ExVs), and in exosomes isolated from the plasma of prostate cancer patients. Here, we show that the αvβ3 integrin is found in patient blood exosomes purified by sucrose or iodixanol density gradients. In addition, we provide evidence that the αvβ3 integrin is transferred through ExVs isolated from prostate cancer patient plasma to β3-negative recipient cells. We also demonstrate the intracellular localization of β3-GFP transferred via cancer cell-derived ExVs. We show that the ExVs present in plasma from prostate cancer patients contain higher levels of αvβ3 and CD9 as compared to plasma ExVs from age-matched subjects who are not affected by cancer. Furthermore, using PSMA antibody-bead mediated immunocapture, we show that the αvβ3 integrin is expressed in a subset of exosomes characterized by PSMA, CD9, CD63, and an epithelial-specific marker, Trop-2. Finally, we present evidence that the levels of αvβ3, CD63, and CD9 remain unaltered in ExVs isolated from the blood of prostate cancer patients treated with enzalutamide. Our results suggest that detecting exosomal αvβ3 integrin in prostate cancer patients could be a clinically useful and non-invasive biomarker to follow prostate cancer progression.

Activation of TLR4 can promote cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). However, little is known about the effects of TLR4/COX-2 in prostate cancer (PCa). MATERIAL AND METHODS In our study, TLR4 and COX-2 expressions were detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in PCa tissues (n=34). Cell proliferation was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) assays. The migration and invasion abilities were detected by wound healing and Transwell assays. qRT-PCR and western blot assays were performed to detect TLR4, COX-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, epithelial-cadherin (E-cadherin), vimentin, NF-κB (p65), and p-p65 expressions. RESULTS The results revealed that TLR4 and COX-2 were upregulated in PCa tissues; Silencing of TLR4 or COX-2 inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and TLR4 siRNAs combined with COX-2 siRNAs synergistically suppressed PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Silencing of TLR4 or COX-2 also downregulated MMP-2, MMP-9, and E-cadherin expressions, and upregulated TIMP-1 and vimentin expressions. In addition, silencing of TLR4 or COX-2 inhibited p65 phosphorylation and had a synergistic effect.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the importance of EPLIN in prostate cancer progression, with particular focus on the mechanistic implications to elucidate EPLIN's tumor suppressive function in cancer. EPLIN expression was evaluated in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. PC-3 and LNCaP EPLINα overexpression models were generated through transfection with EPLINα sequence and EPLIN knockdown was achieved using shRNA in CA-HPV-10 cells. Functional assays were performed to evaluate cellular characteristics and potential mechanisms were evaluated using a protein microarray, and validated using western blot analysis. EPLIN expression was reduced in clinical prostate cancer sections, including hyperplasia (p ≤ 0.001) and adenocarcinoma (p = 0.005), when compared to normal prostate tissue. EPLINα overexpression reduced cell growth, migration and invasion, and influenced transcript, protein and phosphoprotein expression of paxillin, FAK and Src. EPLIN knockdown increased the invasive and migratory nature of CA-HPV-10 cells and also induced changes to FAK and Src total and/or phospho expression. Functional characterization of cellular migration and invasion in addition to FAK and Src inhibition demonstrated differential effects between control and EPLINα overexpression and EPLIN knockdown cell lines. This study highlights that EPLIN expression in prostate cancer is able to influence several aspects of cancer cell characteristics, including cell growth, migration and invasion.

Achieving maximal inhibition of tumor growth through PI3K pathway inhibition requires sustained inhibition of PI3K signaling; however, efficacy is often limited by suboptimal inhibition or reactivation of the pathway. To select combinations that deliver comprehensive suppression of PI3K signaling in PTEN-null tumors, the PI3Kβ inhibitor AZD8186 was combined with inhibitors of kinases implicated in pathway reactivation in an extended cell proliferation assay. Inhibiting PI3Kβ and mTOR gave the most effective antiproliferative effects across a panel of PTEN-null tumor cell lines. The combination of AZD8186 and the mTOR inhibitor vistusertib was also effective in vivo controlling growth of PTEN-null tumor models of TNBC, prostate, and renal cancers. In vitro, the combination resulted in increased suppression of pNDRG1, p4EBP1, as well as HMGCS1 with reduced pNDRG1 and p4EBP1 more closely associated with effective suppression of proliferation. In vivo biomarker analysis revealed that the monotherapy and combination treatment consistently reduced similar biomarkers, while combination increased nuclear translocation of the transcription factor FOXO3 and reduction in glucose uptake. These data suggest that combining the PI3Kβ inhibitor AZD8186 and vistusertib has potential to be an effective combination treatment for PTEN-null tumors.

Methods:   Prostate cancer cells were treated with urolithin A, urolithin B, urolithin C or their combinations with bicalutamide. Cell proliferation was determined by DNA fluorescence with Hoechst 33258. The combination index method was used to examine interactions. Apoptosis and androgen receptor (AR) localization were analysed by flow cytometry. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) secretion was measured by ELISA.  Results:   Urolithins inhibited proliferation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The mixtures of bicalutamide with uroA and uroB had additive anti-proliferative effect. All tested urolithins induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells. However, the combinations of bicalutamide with urolithin A and urolithin B had attenuated pro-apoptotic activity. UroA and uroC decreased DHT-induced PSA secretion. In contrast, uroB impaired PSA lowering effect of bicalutamide. UroA, individually and in combination with bicalutamide, promoted cytoplasmic localization of AR.  Conclusion:   Urolithins might contribute to chemopreventive activity of ellagitannin rich preparations. Our results support use of ellagitannin rich preparations in prostate cancer chemoprevention, but advise caution in their potential use in complementary therapy of prostate cancer.

Methods:   Blood monocytes from advanced and stable PCa patients were cultured, and the conditioned media (CM) were collected and analyzed using standard invasion and wound closure assays to measure effects on invasion and motility of PCa tumor cells. We then identified the proteome profile of these monocytes using proteome array and ELISA.  Results:   Conditioned media from circulating monocytes in patients with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa-M) increased invasion of epithelial PCa cells in vitro. Proteome Profiler Analysis revealed that monocyte-derived CM from metastatic castration-resistant (mCRPC) patients presented high levels of chitinase-3-like 1 (CHI3L1, YKL-40) when compared to patients with stable disease (PCa-N) and healthy control individuals (HC). The only described receptor for CHI3L1, interleukin-13 receptor α2 (IL-13Rα2), was significantly up-regulated in the human metastatic PCa cell line, ARCaPM . Accordingly, we observed that the activation of IL-13Rα2 from PCa-M CM increased the invasiveness of ARCaPM cells while siRNA directed against this receptor significantly reduced invasiveness of these cells in the presence of CM from PCa-M patients.

Patients were eligible for the present study if they had either (1) completed radical prostatectomy, (2) completed radiotherapy and (neo)-adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), or (3) were undergoing lifelong ADT. Adverse effects were measured by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice.  Results:   In total, 696 patients were included. There was no statistically significant difference in level of PA across treatment modalities. Bowel symptoms mainly related to radiotherapy decreased the odds of exercising ≥ 2 times per week, along with age ≥ 70 years, participation in the workforce, and BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2. Among patients who were undergoing ADT, 5 years or more since diagnosis reduced the odds of exercising ≥ 2 times per week by almost 60%.  Conclusion:   The level of PA did not differ across PCa patients treated with different modalities. Increasing bowel symptoms reduced the likelihood of exercising ≥ 2 times per week. PCa patients should be educated about possible treatment-induced AEs affecting PA level, enabling them to counteract the development of physical inactivity.""","""['Synne-Kristin Hoffart Bøhn', 'Sophie Dorothea Fosså', 'Torbjørn Wisløff', 'Lene Thorsen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['A national study of adverse effects and global quality of life among candidates for curative treatment for prostate cancer.', 'Use of Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients Treated with Early Salvage Radiotherapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: Long-term Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Series.', 'Differential Risk of Castration Resistance After Initial Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Locally advanced prostate cancer: effective treatments, but many adverse effects.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: consider both benefits and risks.', 'Barriers and facilitators related to undertaking physical activities among men with prostate cancer: a scoping review.', 'Fatigue, barriers to physical activity and predictors for motivation to exercise in advanced Cancer patients.']"""

In this study, it was postulated that radiopharmaceuticals, added to bisphosphonates, could further decrease the incidence of SREs.  Methods:   NRG Oncology RTOG 0517 randomized patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer and blastic bone metastases to either zoledronic acid (ZA) alone or ZA plus radiopharmaceuticals (Sr-89 or Sm-153). The primary endpoint was time to development of SREs. Secondary objectives included quality of life (QOL), pain control, overall survival (OS), and toxicity.  Results:   261 patients (median age 68; 62% male; 55% prostate, 35% breast, 10% lung) were accrued between July 2006 and February 2011. The study closed early due to a lower than expected rate of SREs. 52 (42%) patients in the ZA arm and 49 (40%) in the radiopharmaceutical arm experienced an SRE. Median time free of SREs was 29.9 and 27.4 months, respectively (p = 0.84). Median OS in the ZA arm and radiopharmaceutical arms was 32.1 and 26.9 months, respectively (p = 0.37). Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that primary disease site (lung) and number of bone metastases (> 2) had a negative impact on OS (p < 0.0001, p = 0.01, respectively). The addition of radiopharmaceuticals to ZA led to a significant reduction in pain at 1 month based on BPI worst score (p = 0.02). No other group differences were noted for QOL or toxicity.

Although it is known that some FGFR isoforms confer advantages in cell proliferation and survival, the mechanism by which the subversion of different FGFR isoforms contributes to PCa progression is incompletely understood. Here, we report that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) promotes NF-κB signaling in PCa cells and that this increase is associated with FGFR1 expression. Disruption of FGFR1 kinase activity abrogated both FGF activity and NF-κB signaling in PCa cells. Of note, the three common signaling pathways downstream of FGFR1 kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/AKT), and phosphoinositide phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), were not required for FGF-mediated NF-κB signaling. Instead, transforming growth factor β-activating kinase 1 (TAK1), a central regulator of the NF-κB pathway, was required for FGFR1 to stimulate NF-κB signaling. Moreover, we found that FGFR1 promotes NF-κB signaling in PCa cells by reducing TAK1 degradation and thereby supporting sustained NF-κB activation. Consistently, Fgfr1 ablation in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model reduced inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. In contrast, activation of the FGFR1 kinase in the juxtaposition of chemical-induced dimerization (CID) and kinase 1 (JOCK1) mouse model increased inflammation. As inflammation plays an important role in PCa initiation and progression, these findings suggest that ectopically expressed FGFR1 promotes PCa progression, at least in part, by increasing inflammation in the tumor microenvironment.""","""['Cong Wang', 'Yuepeng Ke', 'Shaoyou Liu', 'Sharon Pan', 'Ziying Liu', 'Hui Zhang', 'Zhichao Fan', 'Changyi Zhou', 'Junchen Liu', 'Fen Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Combination treatment of prostate cancer with FGF receptor and AKT kinase inhibitors.', 'Constitutive activation of P I3 K-Akt and NF-kappaB during prostate cancer progression in autochthonous transgenic mouse model.', '8p12 stem cell myeloproliferative disorder: the FOP-fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 fusion protein of the t(6;8) translocation induces cell survival mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathways.', 'Intrinsic FGFR2 and Ectopic FGFR1 Signaling in the Prostate and Prostate Cancer.', 'Epithelial growth factor receptor-activated nuclear factor κB signaling and its role in epithelial growth factor receptor-associated tumors.', 'Identification of a novel HOOK3-FGFR1 fusion gene involved in activation of the NF-kappaB pathway.', 'The Role of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) Signaling in Tissue Repair and Regeneration.', 'Cellular Mechanisms of FGF-Stimulated Tissue Repair.', 'Microtubule Acetylation Controls MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cell Invasion through the Modulation of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.', 'The stabilization of yes-associated protein by TGFβ-activated kinase 1 regulates the self-renewal and oncogenesis of gastric cancer stem cells.']"""

Here we report a series of patients treated with focal HIFU therapy, discuss its potential pitfalls, and address controversies concerning the indications.  Materials and methods:   This single-center prospective study reports outcomes of patients treated from September 2014 to March 2016. Follow-up was a minimum of 12 months. MRI/TRUS-fusion-guided HIFU was performed under general anesthesia using the Focal One® device (EDAP, France). A control biopsy at 12 months was taken using the MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsy platform Artemis™ (Eigen, California) combining targeted and systematic cores. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes from baseline, patient-reported outcome measures, and complications using the Clavien-Dindo classification system are also reported.  Results:   Twenty-four patients (PSA < 10 ng/ml, n = 17 Gleason 3+3, n = 7 Gleason 3+4) with either unifocal or bifocal prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) 3-5 lesions (n = 19) or without a PI-RADS lesion (n = 5) were treated. Nineteen patients underwent focal HIFU, five patients zonal HIFU. Of the 20 patients that had biopsies at 12 months, 8 patients had a positive biopsy within the ablation zone (overall cancer free rate: 60%). Using different definitions of clinically significant cancer, the cancer-free rate for the ablation zone varies between 75% and 95%. Four of the eight patients (all persistent Gleason 3+4 or upgrading to 4+3) underwent a radical whole gland salvage therapy. Patient-reported outcome measures showed no significant decrease in urinary continence (expanded prostate cancer index composite -26 urinary incontinence: P = 0.080), but there was a reduction in potency (International index of erectile function in preoperatively potent patients: median decrease of 2 points to a median of 19 points at 12 months; 95% confidence interval: 15.79-22.21; P = 0.044). Only one complication > grade II occurred.  Conclusions:   Targeted MRI/TRUS fusion-guided focal HIFU allows local tumor ablation, but is not free from limitations. The procedure has good functional outcomes and a quick recovery.

Recent efforts from our laboratories identified a number of agonistic peptides targeting the ligand-binding domain of the EphA2 receptor. The individual agents, however, were still relatively weak in affinities (micromolar range) that precluded detailed structural studies on the mode of action. Using a systematic optimization of the 12-mer peptide mimetic 123B9, we were able to first derive an agent that displayed a submicromolar affinity for the receptor. This agent enabled cocrystallization with the EphA2 ligand-binding domain providing for the first time the structural basis for their agonistic mechanism of action. In addition, the atomic coordinates of the complex enabled rapid iterations of structure-based optimizations that resulted in a novel agonistic agent, named 135H11, with a nanomolar affinity for the receptor, as demonstrated by in vitro binding assays (isothermal titration calorimetry measurements), and a biochemical displacement assay. As we have recently demonstrated, the cellular activity of these agents is further increased by synthesizing dimeric versions of the compounds. Hence, we report that a dimeric version of 135H11 is extremely effective at low nanomolar concentrations to induce cellular receptor activation, internalization, and inhibition of cell migration in a pancreatic cancer cell line. Given the pivotal role of EphA2 in tumor growth, angiogenesis, drug resistance, and metastasis, these agents, and the associated structural studies, provide significant advancements in the field for the development of novel EphA2-targeting therapeutics or diagnostics.""","""['Luca Gambini', 'Ahmed F Salem', 'Parima Udompholkul', 'Xiao-Feng Tan', 'Carlo Baggio', 'Neh Shah', 'Alexander Aronson', 'Jikui Song', 'Maurizio Pellecchia']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""ACS Chem Biol""","""['Targefrin: A Potent Agent Targeting the Ligand Binding Domain of EphA2.', 'Effective Tumor Targeting by EphA2-Agonist-Biotin-Streptavidin Conjugates.', 'Engineering nanomolar peptide ligands that differentially modulate EphA2 receptor signaling.', 'The Sam Domain of EphA2 Receptor and its Relevance to Cancer: A Novel Challenge for Drug Discovery?', 'Hunting for Novel Routes in Anticancer Drug Discovery: Peptides against Sam-Sam Interactions.', 'Targefrin: A Potent Agent Targeting the Ligand Binding Domain of EphA2.', 'Synergetic collision and space separation in microfluidic chip for efficient affinity-discriminated molecular selection.', 'Non-canonical EphA2 activation underpins PTEN-mediated metastatic migration and poor clinical outcome in prostate cancer.', 'Single-EV analysis (sEVA) of mutated proteins allows detection of stage 1 pancreatic cancer.', 'Ligands with different dimeric configurations potently activate the EphA2 receptor and reveal its potential for biased signaling.']"""

Similar risk decrease was not observed in other drug groups. Anti-HT drugs were also associated with an increased risk of starting ADT, with the exception of ATR-blockers (HR: 0.81 CI:0.71-0.92). ATR- blockers differ from other anti-HT drugs as the survival is better in users of this drug group. The result partly supports the role of RAA system in PCa progression.

Considering the application of MR-guided radiotherapy and online adaptive replanning, sCT generation should occur within minutes. This work aims at assessing whether an existing deep learning network can rapidly generate sCT images for accurate MR-based dose calculations in the entire pelvis. A study was conducted on data of 91 patients with prostate (59), rectal (18) and cervical (14) cancer who underwent external beam radiotherapy acquiring both CT and MRI for patients' simulation. Dixon reconstructed water, fat and in-phase images obtained from a conventional dual gradient-recalled echo sequence were used to generate sCT images. A conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) was trained in a paired fashion on 2D transverse slices of 32 prostate cancer patients. The trained network was tested on the remaining patients to generate sCT images. For 30 patients in the test set, dose recalculations of the clinical plan were performed on sCT images. Dose distributions were evaluated comparing voxel-based dose differences, gamma and dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis. The sCT generation required 5.6 s and 21 s for a single patient volume on a GPU and CPU, respectively. On average, sCT images resulted in a higher dose to the target of maximum 0.3%. The average gamma pass rates using the 3%, 3 mm and 2%, 2 mm criteria were above 97 and 91%, respectively, for all volumes of interests considered. All DVH points calculated on sCT differed less than ±2.5% from the corresponding points on CT. Results suggest that accurate MR-based dose calculation using sCT images generated with a cGAN trained on prostate cancer patients is feasible for the entire pelvis. The sCT generation was sufficiently fast for integration in an MR-guided radiotherapy workflow.""","""['Matteo Maspero', 'Mark H F Savenije', 'Anna M Dinkla', 'Peter R Seevinck', 'Martijn P W Intven', 'Ina M Jurgenliemk-Schulz', 'Linda G W Kerkmeijer', 'Cornelis A T van den Berg']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Feasibility of MRI-only treatment planning for proton therapy in brain and prostate cancers: Dose calculation accuracy in substitute CT images.', 'MR to CT synthesis with multicenter data in the pelvic area using a conditional generative adversarial network.', 'Generation of abdominal synthetic CTs from 0.35T MR images using generative adversarial networks for MR-only liver radiotherapy.', 'Deep learning methods to generate synthetic CT from MRI in radiotherapy: A literature review.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical validation of MR imaging time reduction for substitute/synthetic CT generation for prostate MRI-only treatment planning.', 'Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognostic Evaluation of Mediastinal Malignant Tumors.', 'Synthetic computed tomography generation for abdominal adaptive radiotherapy using low-field magnetic resonance imaging.']"""

Overexpression of Androgen Receptor (AR) coactivators such as transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2) is associated with poor CRPC patient outcomes. We describe the implementation of the AR-TIF2 protein-protein interaction biosensor (PPIB) assay in a high-content screening (HCS) campaign of 143,535 compounds. The assay performed robustly and reproducibly and enabled us to identify compounds that inhibited dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced AR-TIF2 protein-protein interaction (PPI) formation or disrupted preexisting AR-TIF2 PPIs. We used multiparameter HCS data z-scores to identify and deprioritize cytotoxic or autofluorescent outliers and confirmed the resulting qualified actives in triplicate. None of the confirmed AR-TIF2 PPIB inhibitors/disruptors exhibited activity in a p53-hDM2 PPIB counter screen, indicating that they were unlikely to be either nonselective PPI inhibitors or to interfere with the biosensor assay format. However, eight confirmed AR-TIF2 PPIB actives also inhibited the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) nuclear translocation counter screen by >50%. These compounds were deprioritized because they either lacked AR specificity/selectivity, or they inhibited a shared component of the AR and GR signaling pathways. Twenty-nine confirmed AR-TIF2 PPIB actives also inhibited the AR nuclear localization counter screen, suggesting that they might indirectly inhibit the AR-TIF2 PPIB assay rather than directly blocking/disrupting PPIs. A total of 62.2% of the confirmed actives inhibited the DHT-induced AR-TIF2 PPI formation in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50s < 40 μM, and 59.4% also disrupted preexisting AR-TIF2 PPI complexes. Overall, the hit rate for the AR-TIF2 PPIB HCS campaign was 0.12%, and most hits inhibited AR-TIF2 PPI formation and disrupted preexisting AR-TIF2 complexes with similar AR-red fluorescent protein distribution phenotypes.

Studies have been conducted to increase the quality of planning and reduce the costs associated with planning through automated planning method; however, few studies have used the deep learning method for optimization of planning. The purpose of this study was to propose an automated method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for predicting the dosimetric eligibility of patients with prostate cancer undergoing IMRT. Sixty patients with prostate cancer who underwent IMRT were included in the study. Treatment strategy involved division of the patients into two groups, namely, meeting all dose constraints and not meeting all dose constraints, by experienced medical physicists. We used AlexNet (i.e., one of common CNN architectures) for CNN-based methods to predict the two groups. An AlexNet CNN pre-trained on ImageNet was fine-tuned. Two dataset formats were used as input data: planning computed tomography (CT) images and structure labels. Five-fold cross-validation was used, and performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, and prediction accuracy. Class activation mapping was used to visualize the internal representation learned by the CNN. Prediction accuracies of the model with the planning CT image dataset and that with the structure label dataset were 56.7 ± 9.7% and 70.0 ± 11.3%, respectively. Moreover, the model with structure labels focused on areas associated with dose constraints.

We demonstrated that SAMC inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, while induced apoptosis of human HCC cells without influencing normal hepatocytes. SAMC directly interacted with Wnt-pathway co-receptor LRP6 on the cell membrane. LRP6 was frequently over-expressed in the tumor tissue of human HCC patients (66.7% of 48 patients) and its over-expression only correlated with the over-expression of β-catenin, but not with age, gender, tumor size, stage and metastasis. Deficiency or over-expression of LRP6 in hepatoma cells could partly mimic or counteract the anti-tumor properties of SAMC, respectively. In vivo administration of SAMC significantly suppressed the growth of Huh-7 xenograft/orthotopic HCC tumor without causing undesirable side effects. In addition, stable down-regulation of LRP6 in Huh-7 facilitated the anti-HCC effects of SAMC. In conclusion, LRP6 can be a potential therapeutic target of HCC.

EVs contain a myriad of substances (proteins, lipid, RNA, DNA) that provide a reservoir of circulating molecules, thus offering a good source of biomarkers. We demonstrate here that large EVs (L-EV) (large oncosomes) isolated from prostate cancer (PCa) cells and patient plasma are an EV population that is enriched in chromosomal DNA, including large fragments up to 2 million base pair long. While L-EVs and small EVs (S-EV) (exosomes) isolated from the same cells contained similar amounts of protein, the DNA was more abundant in L-EV, despite S-EVs being more numerous. Consistent with in vitro observations, the abundance of DNA in L-EV obtained from PCa patient plasma was variable but frequently high. Conversely, negligible amounts of DNA were present in the S-EVs from the same patients. Controlled experimental conditions, with spike-ins of L-EVs and S-EVs from cancer cells in human plasma from healthy subjects, showed that circulating DNA is almost exclusively enclosed in L-EVs.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has gradually become an alternative choice for patients, which can be attributed to the high cost of leading cancer treatments (including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) and the severe related adverse effects. As a critical component of CAM, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has increasing application in preventing and treating cancer over the past few decades. Huanglian Jiedu Decoction (HJD), a classical Chinese compound formula, has been recognized to exert a beneficial effect on cancer treatment, with few adverse effects reported. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear yet. In this study, we had integrated systems pharmacology and bioinformatics to explore the major active ingredients against cancer, targets for cancer treatment, and the related mechanisms of action. These targets were scrutinized using web-based Gene SeT Analysis Toolkit (WebGestalt), and 10 KEGG pathways were identified by enrichment analysis. Refined analysis of the KEGG pathways indicated that the anticancer effect of HJD showed a functional correlation with the p53 signaling pathway; moreover, HJD had potential therapeutic effect on prostate cancer (PCa) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Afterwards, genetic alterations and survival analysis of key targets for cancer treatment were examined in both PCa and SCLC. Our results suggested that such integrated research strategy might serve as a new paradigm to guide future research on Chinese compound formula. Importantly, such strategy contributes to studying the anticancer effect and the mechanisms of action of Chinese compound formula, which has also laid down the foundation for clinical application.""","""['Yifei Dai', 'Liang Sun', 'Weijie Qiang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Evid Based Complement Alternat Med""","""['Integrating Network Pharmacology and Experimental Models to Investigate the Efficacy of Coptidis and Scutellaria Containing Huanglian Jiedu Decoction on Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Integrating Network Pharmacology and Experimental Models to Investigate the Mechanism of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction on Inflammatory Injury Induced by Cerebral Ischemia.', 'A Novel Strategy for Decoding and Validating the Combination Principles of Huanglian Jiedu Decoction From Multi-Scale Perspective.', 'Application of Traditional Chinese Medicines as Personalized Therapy in Human Cancers.', 'Berberine and Coptidis rhizoma as novel antineoplastic agents: a review of traditional use and biomedical investigations.', 'Functions of Traditional Chinese Medicine Combined with Recombinant Human Interferon α2b in Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasias Patients.', 'The Research on the Treatment of Metastatic Skin Cutaneous Melanoma by Huanglian Jiedu Decoction Based on the Analysis of Immune Infiltration Analysis.', 'Analysis of Antidepressant Activity of Huang-Lian Jie-Du Decoction Through Network Pharmacology and Metabolomics.', 'Network pharmacological systems study of Huang-Lian-Tang in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Guizhi Fuling Decoction inhibiting the PI3K and MAPK pathways in breast cancer cells revealed by HTS2 technology and systems pharmacology.']"""

Altered expression of DUSP1 induced changes in the expression of genes involved in various biological pathways, including cell-cell signaling and angiogenesis. To understand more about the role of DUSP1 in SCCP, we evaluated the biological function and associated regulatory mechanism of DUSP1. In this study, DUSP1 was significantly down-regulated in human SCCP compared with the non-carcinoma tissues (P < 0.05). Overexpression of DUSP1 was found to suppress MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in PC-3 cells. Additionally, silencing of DUSP1 enhanced MAPK signaling and PC-3 cell proliferation. Moreover, it was observed that DUSP1 blocked the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK induced by anisomycin.

We performed a meta-analysis of previous studies to investigate suicide incidence and associated risk factors among men diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Methods:   The MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify eligible studies published before April 2018. The inverse variance method with random-effects modeling was used to calculate summary relative risks (RRs) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   Eight observational studies involving 1,281,393 men diagnosed with prostate cancer and 842,294 matched prostate cancer-free men were included. An overall increased RR of suicide of 2.01 (95% CI: 1.52-2.64; P < 0.001; I2 = 91.8%) was observed among men diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with those without prostate cancer during the first year, especially during the first 6 months (RR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.77-2.85; P < 0.001; I2 = 61.1%) after diagnosis. Moreover, prostate cancer patients were at an increased risk of suicide among men aged 75 years or older (RR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.04-2.18; P = 0.028; I2 = 91.5%) and treated with hormonal therapy (RR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.54-2.12; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%). Furthermore, marital status, race, disease risk category, and socioeconomic status were not associated with increased suicide risk in men with prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Current evidence indicates that the risk of suicide is increased among men diagnosed with prostate cancer, particularly those aged 75 years or older, <12 months after diagnosis, and treated with hormonal therapy. Healthcare providers should be aware of these special populations considered at high risk of suicide. Hence, further research should be conducted to refine suicide risk assessment with detection tools and to develop the best practices for prevention.""","""['Zhenlang Guo', 'Shu Gan', 'Yuan Li', 'Chiming Gu', 'Songtao Xiang', 'Jianfu Zhou', 'Leiliang Gong', 'Franky Leung Chan', 'Shusheng Wang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Risk of suicide in men with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Increased risk of suicide in New South Wales men with prostate cancer: Analysis of linked population-wide data.', 'Immediate risk for cardiovascular events and suicide following a prostate cancer diagnosis: prospective cohort study.', 'Quantifying observational evidence for risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Risks of alcohol and drug use disorders in prostate cancer survivors: a national cohort study.', 'Living with prostate cancer: a mixed-method evaluation of group therapy intervention to alleviate psychological distress in a Canadian setting.', 'Sexual health and treatment-related sexual dysfunction in sexual and gender minorities with prostate cancer.', 'Impact of previous depression on the risk of suicide among prostate cancer patients.', 'Association between benign prostatic hyperplasia and suicide in South Korea: A nationwide retrospective cohort study.']"""

Methods:   Race-specific prostate cancer risk associations were examined among men in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study. We identified 1417 cases among black men (209 advanced), and 28,845 among white men (3898 advanced). Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also evaluated the cumulative change in the HR for black race following adjustment for each factor.  Results:   Race-specific prostate cancer associations were similar in black and white men across disease subtypes only for history of diabetes (overall : HR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.90 and HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.69-0.76, respectively; Pinteraction = 0.66). By contrast, there was a positive risk association with height for white men and inverse for black men (Pinteraction: non-advanced = 0.01; advanced = 0.04). This difference remained among men with at least 2 years of follow-up for non-advanced (Pinteraction = 0.01), but not advanced disease (Pinteraction = 0.24); or after adjustment for prostate cancer screening (non-advanced Pinteraction = 0.53, advanced Pinteraction = 0.31). The only other evidence of interaction with race was observed for dietary vitamin D intake and non-advanced disease, but only after adjustment for screening (Pinteraction = 0.02). Cumulative adjustment for each factor increased the HR for black race by 32.9% for overall cancer and 12.4% for advanced disease.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest few of the dietary, nutrient, and health-related factors associated with prostate cancer risk in predominantly non-Hispanic white men were associated with risk in black men, and adjustment for these factors widen the black-white difference in risk.

Some of these compounds have shown radiosensitizing capabilities. CLR127 is a novel, clinical-grade antitumor APL ether analog, a subtype of synthetic APL broadly targeting cancer cells with limited uptake in normal tissues. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of CLR127 to modulate radiation response across several adult and pediatric cancer types in vitro as well as in murine xenograft models of human prostate adenocarcinoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. In vitro, CLR127 demonstrated selective uptake in cancer cells compared to normal cells. In cancer cells, CLR127 treatment prior to radiation significantly decreased clonogenic survival in vitro, and led to increased radiation-induced double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breakage compared with radiation alone, which was not observed in normal controls. In animal models, CLR127 effectively increased the antitumor response to fractionated radiotherapy and led to delayed tumor regrowth at potentially clinically achievable doses. In conclusion, our study highlights the ability of CLR127 to increase radiation response in several cancer types. Given almost universal uptake of CLR127 in malignant cells, future research should test whether the observed effects can be extended to other tumor types. Our data provide a strong rationale for clinical testing of CLR127 as a tumor-targeted radiosensitizing agent.

Materials and methods:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to identify men diagnosed with low-risk PCa during 2010-2013. We assessed the use of prostate MRI and management using claims in period surrounding PCa diagnosis. The relation of clinical and demographic factors to receipt of MRI was evaluated with multivariable logistic regression analysis. Following propensity score matching, we fit conditional logistic regression models to examine the association between prostate MRI and initial management, ie, observation or definitive treatment.  Results:   Of 8144 patients with low-risk PCa, 495 (6.1%) received MRI. Use of MRI increased from 3.4% in 2010 to 10.5% in 2013. A total of 3060 (37.6%) patients received observation. MRI was performed in 265 (8.7%) of patients receiving observation, and 230 (4.5%) who were treated (P < .0001). In multivariable analysis, measures of socioeconomic status were significantly associated with the use of prostate MRI. Following propensity score matching, receipt of prostate MRI surrounding the diagnosis of PCa was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of observation (odds ratio = 1.90, 95% confidence interval: 1.56-2.32). This effect persisted in sensitivity analyses attempting to exclude treatment-planning MRIs.  Conclusion:   Receipt of prostate MRI surrounding PCa diagnosis was associated with a nearly 2-fold greater odds of receiving observation vs definitive treatment.""","""['Michael S Leapman', 'Rong Wang', 'Henry S Park', 'James B Yu', 'Jeffrey C Weinreb', 'Cary P Gross', 'Xiaomei Ma']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Re: Association between Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Observation for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'EDITORIAL COMMENT.', 'Increasing Utilization of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance.', 'Risk-stratification based on magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density may reduce unnecessary follow-up biopsy procedures in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Risk-based Patient Selection for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsy after Negative Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Random Biopsy Avoids Unnecessary Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

We studied 1,738 incident cases of breast cancer and another 817 cases of prostate cancer.

Once this genetic score is available, the association between genetic pigmentation score and cancer can be identified as the association between phototype and cancer.  Results:   The association between the genetic pigmentation score and phototype in controls showed that a higher genetic pigmentation score was associated with fair skin, blond hair, blue eyes and the presence of freckles.

In addition, due to the weak echo signal and the low contrast of TRUS images, it is difficult to diagnose early-stage prostate cancers and distinguish malignant tumors from benign prostatic hyperplasia. For this reason, TRUS image-guided biopsy is mandatory to confirm the malignancy of the suspicious tumor, but the diagnostic accuracy of initial biopsy is only 20%-30%, so that the patients inevitably undergo repeated biopsies. TRUS-photoacoustic (TRUS-PA) imaging is one way to resolve those problems. However, the development of a TRUS-PA probe, in which an ultrasound array transducer and optical fibers are integrated, is demanding because the overall size of the probe should be as small as possible for the convenience of the patients, while providing the desired performances. Here, we report a recently developed TRUS-PA probe. The core element of the TRUS-PA is a miniaturized 128-element, 7-MHz convex array transducer of which size in the lateral and elevational directions is 11.4 and 5 mm, respectively. A new concept of a flexible printed circuit board was also developed to limit the size of the TRUS-PA probe to less than 15 mm. From the performance evaluation, it was found that the developed array with a field-of-view of 134° has a center frequency of 6.75 MHz, a -6-dB fractional bandwidth of 66%, and a crosstalk of less than -45 dB. In the tissue-mimicking phantom test and ex vivo experiments, the miniaturized convex array proved to be capable of providing combined US and PA images with acceptable imaging quality in spite of its small size.""","""['Jihun Jang', 'Jin Ho Chang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control""","""['Transrectal Ultrasound and Photoacoustic Imaging Probe for Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Simultaneous transrectal ultrasound and photoacoustic human prostate imaging.', 'Computerized supported transrectal ultrasound (C-TRUS) in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Transrectal ultrasonography for the detection and staging of carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Transrectal Ultrasound and Photoacoustic Imaging Probe for Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'A 40-MHz Ultrasound Transducer with an Angled Aperture for Guiding Percutaneous Revascularization of Chronic Total Occlusion: A Feasibility Study.']"""

We conducted a randomized trial testing the hypothesis that dose-escalated, moderately hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (HIMRT) improves prostate cancer control compared with conventionally fractionated IMRT (CIMRT) for men with localized prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Men were randomly assigned to 75.6 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions delivered over 8.4 weeks (CIMRT) or 72 Gy in 2.4 Gy fractions delivered over 6 weeks (HIMRT, biologically equivalent to 85 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions assuming prostate cancer α-to-β ratio of 1.5). Failure was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure (nadir plus 2 ng/mL) or initiation of salvage therapy. Modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria were used to grade late (≥ 90 days after completion of radiotherapy) GI and genitourinary toxicity.  Results:   Most of the 206 men (72%) had cT1, Gleason score 6 or 7 (99%), and PSA level ≤ 10 ng/mL (90%) disease. Androgen deprivation therapy was received by 24%. With a median follow-up of 8.5 years, men treated with HIMRT experienced fewer treatment failures (n = 10) than men treated with CIMRT (n = 21; P = .036). The 8-year failure rate was 10.7% (95% CI, 5.8% to 19.1%) with HIMRT and 15.4% (95% CI, 9.1% to 25.4%) with CIMRT. There was no difference in overall survival ( P = .39). There was a nonsignificant increase in late grade 2 or 3 GI toxicity with HIMRT (8-year 5.0% v 12.6%; P = .08). However, GI toxicity was only 8.6% when rectal volume receiving 65 Gy of HIMRT was ≤ 15%. Late genitourinary toxicity was similar ( P = .84). There was no grade 4 toxicity.

However, single‑drug chemotherapy is associated with an increased risk of drug resistance. Therefore, novel combination chemotherapy regimens are a popular topic of research. Zinc participates in the regulation of apoptosis, for example in the form of Zn2+ and via zinc‑dependent enzymes. Zinc can either induce or suppress apoptosis, and its effect depends primarily on its concentration. Previous research has demonstrated that physiological concentrations of zinc can directly induce apoptosis of PC‑3 prostate cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway. In prostate cancer tissues, zinc concentrations have been demonstrated to be reduced compared with non-cancerous tissues. Furthermore, the concentration of zinc has been demonstrated to decrease further with cancer progression. In the present study, it was investigated whether exposure of PC‑3 cells to zinc improved their sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel. MTT assays, cell clone formation assays, Hoechst staining and flow cytometry revealed that zinc enhanced PC‑3‑cell chemosensitivity to paclitaxel.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were identified through RNA‑seq were applied to Gene Ontology (GO), pathway analysis, pathway‑action networks and protein‑protein interaction network analysis.

Combining GO analysis and pathway analysis, certain DEGs, including phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A), PLA2G2F, PLA2G4C, endothelin 1, cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily B member 6, G protein subunit γ5, nitric oxide synthase 3 and CD38 molecule, were shown to be closely associated with RBM3 regulation in PCa cells. Furthermore, the changes in expression of selected genes upon RBM3‑knockdown in RNA‑seq were confirmed by separate reverse transcription‑quantitative‑polymerase chain reaction, validating the results of RNA‑seq.

This transdifferentiation process is poorly understood, but trafficking of transcriptional factors and/or cytoskeletal rearrangements may be involved. We observed the role of geranylgeranylation in this process by treatment with digeranyl bisphosphonate (DGBP), a selective inhibitor of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase which blocks the prenylation of small GTPases such as Rho and Rab family proteins, including Cdc42 and Rac1.  Methods:   We examined the therapeutic potential of DGBP in LNCaP, C4-2B4, and 22Rv1 cell culture models. Cell morphology and protein expression were quantified to observe the development of the neuroendocrine phenotype in androgen-deprivation and abiraterone-treated LNCaP models of NEPC development. Luciferase reporter assays were utilized to examine AR activity, and immunofluorescence visualized the localization of AR within the cell.  Results:   Essential genes in the isoprenoid pathway, such as HMGCR, MVK, GGPS1, and GGT1, were highly expressed in a subset of castration resistant prostate cancers reported by Beltran et al. Under treatment with DGBP, nuclear localization of AR decreased in LNCaP, 22Rv1, and C4-2B4 cell lines, luciferase reporter activity was reduced in LNCaP and 22Rv1, and AR target gene transcription also decreased in LNCaP. Conversely, nuclear localization of AR was enhanced by the addition of GGOH. Finally, induction of the NEPC structural and molecular phenotype via androgen deprivation in LNCaP cells was inhibited by DGBP in a GGOH-dependent manner.  Conclusions:   DGBP is a novel compound with the potential to reduce AR transcriptional activity and inhibit PCa progression to NEPC phenotype. These results suggest that DGBP may be used to block cell growth and metastasis in both hormone therapy sensitive and resistant paradigms.""","""['Jillian S Weissenrieder', 'Jacqueline E Reilly', 'Jeffrey D Neighbors', 'Raymond J Hohl']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Interleukin-6 induces VEGF secretion from prostate cancer cells in a manner independent of androgen receptor activation.', 'Androgen deprivation-induced ZBTB46-PTGS1 signaling promotes neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer.', ""Down-regulation of androgen receptor by 3,3'-diindolylmethane contributes to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in both hormone-sensitive LNCaP and insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells."", 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'The Role of Epigenetic Change in Therapy-Induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity.', 'RNAseq reveals extensive metabolic disruptions in the sensitive SF-295 cell line treated with schweinfurthins.', 'Antipsychotic drugs elicit cytotoxicity in glioblastoma multiforme in a calcium-dependent, non-D2 receptor-dependent, manner.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Tumor Suppressive Maspin-Sensitized Prostate Cancer to Drug Treatment Through Negative Regulating Androgen Receptor Expression.', 'Hormones Secretion and Rho GTPases in Neuroendocrine Tumors.']"""

Activation of transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β signaling is known to promote EMT for the development of metastatic castration‑resistant prostate cancer (PCa). However, the role of DEC genes in the TGF‑β‑induced EMT of PCa remains unclear. In the present study it was demonstrated that TGF‑β increased the transcriptional/translational levels of DEC1 but decreased those of DEC2 in PC‑3 cells. Moreover, TGF‑β evoked the phosphorylation of Smad2, followed by the activation of mesenchymal markers, such as N‑cadherin and vimentin, in addition to the suppression of epithelial markers, such as E‑cadherin. The knockdown of DEC1 restrained TGF‑β‑induced cell morphology changes as well as cell motility, which was compatible with the upregulation of E‑cadherin and downregulation of pSmad2, N‑cadherin, and vimentin. However, DEC2 knockdown endorsed PC‑3 cells with a more metastatic phenotype. EMT‑related markers in DEC2 siRNA‑transfected cells exhibited a reverse expression pattern when compared with that in DEC1 siRNA‑transfected cells.

However, whether prior treatment with a second-line NSAA would impact the efficacy of abiraterone acetate (Abi) remains uncertain. In the current study, 87 mCRPC patients treated with Abi were analyzed. Among them, 21 were treated with a second-line NSAA (from bicalutamide to flutamide) before receiving abiraterone, while the remaining 66 received Abi directly. Therapeutic efficacy of Abi was compared between those with and without prior second-line NSAA using Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox regression models. The therapeutic efficacy of Abi was similar between those with or without the prior switching treatment of flutamide, in terms of either prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (PSA-PFS, 5.5 vs 5.6 months, P = 0.967), radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS, 12.8 vs 13.4 months, P = 0.508), overall survival (OS, not reached vs 30.6 months, P = 0.606), or PSA-response rate (71.4% [15/21] vs 60.6% [40/66], P = 0.370).

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a surface molecule specifically expressed by prostate tumors that has been shown to be a valid target for internal radionuclide therapy in both preclinical and clinical settings. The most common radiotherapeutic agent is the small molecule 177Lu-PSMA-617, which is under clinical evaluation in multiple countries. Nevertheless, its efficacy in causing tumor regression is still suboptimal, even when administered in several cycles per patient, perhaps due to poor pharmacokinetics (PK), which limits uptake by the tumor cells. We postulated that the addition of the Evans blue (EB) moiety to PSMA-617 would improve the PK by extending circulation half-life, which would increase tumor uptake and improve radiotherapeutic efficacy. PSMA-617 was modified by conjugation of a 2-thiol acetate group onto the primary amine and thereafter reacted with a maleimide functional group of an EB derivative, to give EB-PSMA-617. The PK and radiotherapeutic efficacy of 90Y- or 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 was compared to the clinically used radiopharmaceutical 90Y- or 177Lu- PSMA-617 in PC3-PIP tumor-bearing mice. EB-PSMA-617 retained binding to serum albumin as well as a high internalization rate by tumor cells. Upon injection, metal-labeled EB-PSMA-617 demonstrated an extended blood half-life compared to PSMA-617 and, thereby, prolonged the time window for binding to PSMA. The improved PK of EB-PSMA-617 resulted in significantly higher accumulation in PSMA+ tumors and highly effective radiotherapeutic efficacy. Remarkably, a single dose of 1.85 MBq of 90Y- or 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 was sufficient to eradicate established PMSA+ tumors in mice. No significant body weight loss was observed, suggesting little to no gross toxicity. The construct described here, EB-PSMA-617, may improve the radiotherapeutic efficacy for patients with PSMA-positive tumors by reducing both the amount of activity needed for therapy as well as the frequency of administration, as compared to PSMA-617.""","""['Zhantong Wang', 'Rui Tian', 'Gang Niu', 'Ying Ma', 'Lixin Lang', 'Lawrence P Szajek', 'Dale O Kiesewetter', 'Orit Jacobson', 'Xiaoyuan Chen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['177LuLu-PSMA-617 theranostic probe for hepatocellular carcinoma imaging and therapy.', 'Enhancing Treatment Efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 with the Conjugation of an Albumin-Binding Motif: Preclinical Dosimetry and Endoradiotherapy Studies.', 'First-in-human study of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy in prostate cancer.', 'A Walk with Lu-177 PSMA: How Close we Have Reached from Bench to Bedside?', 'Development of 177LuLu-LNC1003 for radioligand therapy of prostate cancer with a moderate level of PSMA expression.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 theranostic probe for hepatocellular carcinoma imaging and therapy.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen binding radiopharmaceuticals: Current data and new concepts.', 'Pharmacological Optimization of PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy.', 'Current Status of PSMA-Targeted Radioligand Therapy in the Era of Radiopharmaceutical Therapy Acquiring Marketing Authorization.']"""

Researchers have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the genesis and progression of human cancers, including PCa.  Methods:   Bioinformatics analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were utilized to confirm TMPO-AS1 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. The TMPO-AS1 levels in both patient tissues and PCa cell lines were determined by qRT-PCR analysis. Moreover, the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay identified that TMPO-AS1 was a direct target of AR. The effect of overexpression or knockdown of TMPO-AS1 on cell proliferation, migration, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis was assessed by using CCK-8, transwell assays, and flow cytometric analysis, respectively.  Results:   Based on primary screening, we found that TMPO-AS1 could be a useful diagnostic and prognostic marker for PCa, whose expression was upregulated in PCa samples and associated with poorer prognosis. Bioinformatics predictions revealed TMPO-AS1 was associated with a series of biological processes involved in PCa progression. In PCa cells, TMPO-AS1 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and directly down-regulated by AR. Gain/loss-of-function assays showed TMPO-AS1 overexpression increased cell proliferation by promoting cell cycle progression and promoted migration, but reduced apoptosis of PCa cells. In addition, TMPO-AS1 may be a diagnostic and prognostic marker in multiple cancer types.  Conclusions:   AR-regulated lncRNA TMPO-AS1 functioned as an oncogenic lncRNA in PCa, and may be a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker to be used as a therapeutic target for PCa.""","""['Wenhua Huang', 'Xinya Su', 'Wei Yan', 'Zhe Kong', 'Dan Wang', 'Yan Huang', 'Qiaoli Zhai', 'Xiaowei Zhang', 'Hai Wu', 'Yao Li', 'Tao Li', 'Xuechao Wan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Long non-coding RNA VIM-AS1 promotes prostate cancer growth and invasion by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Long noncoding RNA TMPO-AS1 promotes lung adenocarcinoma progression and is negatively regulated by miR-383-5p.', 'LncRNA LOXL1-AS1/miR-let-7a-5p/EGFR-related pathway regulates the doxorubicin resistance of prostate cancer DU-145 cells.', 'The Emerging Role of Thymopoietin-Antisense RNA 1 as Long Noncoding RNA in the Pathogenesis of Human Cancers.', 'The role of long non-coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 in human malignant tumors.', 'The long transcript of lncRNA TMPO-AS1 promotes bone metastases of prostate cancer by regulating the CSNK2A1/DDX3X complex in Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Long non-coding RNA LINC00336 as an independent prognostic indicator and an oncogenic lncRNA in bladder cancer.', 'Underlying Features of Prostate Cancer-Statistics, Risk Factors, and Emerging Methods for Its Diagnosis.', 'The potential of glutamine metabolism-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as prognostic biomarkers in multiple myeloma patients.', 'A long non-coding RNA with important roles in the carcinogenesis.']"""

[68Ga]PSMA-HBED-CC positron emission tomography (PET)/x-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging for detection of biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer (PCa).  Procedures:   Seventy patients with BCR of the PCa and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of less than 2.0 μg/l were subjected to [68Ga]PSMA-HBED-CC PET (mean injected activity 180 MBq). While early imaging contained whole body scans, late imaging was confined to the pelvis and the lower abdomen. Uptake in suspicious lesions was analyzed by peak and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVpeak/max). Tumor-to-background ratios were calculated for all lesions in which the liver served as reference organ. The Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test was used to compare the uptake in suspicious lesions between early and late imaging. Follow-up data were used to validate the existence of the additionally detected lesions.  Results:   Forty-four of the 70 patients thus examined were interpreted as PSMA-positive in early and/or late scans while 26 remained without suspicion of PSMA tracer uptake. A total of 70 suspicious lesions were analyzed. Ten tumor-suspicious lesions from seven different patients were better or exclusively visible in the late measurements while three tumor-suspicious lesions from three different patients were better or exclusively visible in the early images. A validation by follow-up data was possible for 11 of these 13 additionally detected lesions. In direct comparison between early and late imaging, the mean SUVmax in PSMA-positive lesions was 74 % higher (p < 0.001) and the mean SUVpeak was 36 % higher (p = 0.001) in the late scans. The SUVmean in the reference regions was decreasing in the late measurements, whereas the mean TBR increased by a factor of 3 (p < 0.001). Taking confirmed lesions only into account, we estimated a 10 % gain in additionally detected PSMA-positive lesions (7/70) within the patient cohort.  Conclusions:   The time period between injection and data acquisition influences the detection rate of [68Ga]PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT.

Materials and methods:   With IRB approval, 22 consecutive TZ PCa were retrospectively compared with 30 consecutive BPH (15 stromal, 15 glandular) nodules diagnosed using radical prostatectomy MRI maps. Two blinded radiologists (R1/R2) subjectively assessed the shape (round/oval vs. lenticular) and margin (circumscribed vs. blurred/indistinct) and for a T2W hypointense rim. Both radiologists segmented lesions extracting quantitative shape features (circularity, convexity and topology/skeletal branching). Statistical tests were performed using chi-square (subjective features), Mann-Whitney U (quantitative features), Cohen's kappa/Bland-Altman and receiver-operator characteristic analysis.  Results:   There were differences in the subjective analysis of the shape, margin and absence of a T2W-rim comparing TZ PCa with BPH (p < 0.0001) with moderate to almost perfect agreement [kappa = 0.56 (shape), 0.72 (margin), 0.97 (T2W-rim)]. Area under the curve (AUC ± standard error) for diagnosis of TZ PCas was shape = 0.88 ± 0.05, margin = 0.89 ± 0.04, and T2W-rim = 0.91 ± 0.04. Shape, judged subjectively, was specific (100%/94% R1/R2) with low-to-moderate sensitivity (55%/88% R1/R2). Circularity and convexity differed between groups (p < 0.001) with no difference in topology/skeletal branches (p = 0.31). Agreement in measurements was substantial for significant quantitative variables and AUC ± SE, sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of TZ PCa were: circularity = 0.98 ± 0.01, 90%/96%; convexity = 0.85 ± 0.06, 68%/97%. AUCs for circularity were higher than for subjective analysis (p = 0.01 and 0.26).  Conclusion:   Subjective analysis of T2W-MRI accurately diagnoses TZ PCa with high accuracy also demonstrated for quantitative shape analysis, which may be useful for future radiogenomic analysis of transition zone tumors.

Our system was trained using detailed Gleason annotations on a discovery cohort of 641 patients and was then evaluated on an independent test cohort of 245 patients annotated by two pathologists. On the test cohort, the inter-annotator agreements between the model and each pathologist, quantified via Cohen's quadratic kappa statistic, were 0.75 and 0.71 respectively, comparable with the inter-pathologist agreement (kappa = 0.71). Furthermore, the model's Gleason score assignments achieved pathology expert-level stratification of patients into prognostically distinct groups, on the basis of disease-specific survival data available for the test cohort.

Materials and methods:   This study was a translational study that was conducted prospectively by the Spanish Oncology Genito-Urinary Group and included 45 patients with histologically confirmed mCRPC who were treated with radium-223.

We also assessed response according to prostate-specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase levels. CTCs were evaluated as prognostic factor for treatment completion with radium-223 treatment. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were calculated for the global population and were correlated with biomarker response outcomes.  Results:   Significantly, more patients with baseline CTC counts ≤ 5/7.5 mL, which are indicative of better prognoses, completed the 6 injections of therapy than those with CTC counts > 5 (16/22; 73% vs. 6/20; 30%, respectively; P = .012).

We previously provided an alternate route to c-Myc-driven glucose metabolism via the repression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), which is a potent negative regulator of glucose uptake. Herein, we demonstrate that c-Myc suppression of TXNIP is predominantly through the activation of glutaminolysis via glutaminase (GLS1) in prostate cancer cells. Glutamine depletion blocked c-Myc-dependent reductions of TXNIP and its principal regulator MondoA transcriptional activity. Further, GLS1 inhibition by either siRNA or CB-839 resumed TXNIP expression that was repressed by c-Myc. The TXNIP promoter with mutant E-Box region, which was recognized by MondoA, failed to respond to c-Myc or GLS1, indicating c-Myc repression of TXNIP by GLS1 is predominantly through the blockage of MondoA activity. Especially, ectopic TXNIP expression decreased c-Myc-induce glucose uptake and lead to a broad range of glycolytic target gene suppressions. Thus TXNIP is a key adaptor for c-Myc-driven aerobic glycolysis. Supporting the biological significance of c-Myc and TXNIP, their reciprocal relationship are correlates with patient outcome and contributes to the aggressive phenotype in PCAs.""","""['Xuan Qu', 'Jing Sun', 'Yami Zhang', 'Jun Li', 'Junbi Hu', 'Kai Li', 'Lei Gao', 'Liangliang Shen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Metabolic reprogramming in triple-negative breast cancer through Myc suppression of TXNIP.', 'Interactions between Myc and MondoA transcription factors in metabolism and tumourigenesis.', 'Elevated expression of glutaminase confers glucose utilization via glutaminolysis in prostate cancer.', 'Glutamine-dependent anapleurosis dictates glucose uptake and cell growth by regulating MondoA transcriptional activity.', 'An extended Myc network contributes to glucose homeostasis in cancer and diabetes.', 'Glutaminolysis and peripheral CD4+ T cell differentiation: from mechanism to intervention strategy.', 'Rewired Metabolism Caused by the Oncogenic Deregulation of MYC as an Attractive Therapeutic Target in Cancers.', 'Regulative Roles of Metabolic Plasticity Caused by Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation and Glycolysis on the Initiation and Progression of Tumorigenesis.', 'BCR-ABL triggers a glucose-dependent survival program during leukemogenesis through the suppression of TXNIP.', 'Immunometabolic factors contributing to obesity-linked hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Multiple workflows for isolation and content characterization of exosomes in biofluids have been attempted. We report a protocol to isolate and characterize exosomal miRNAs content and assess radiation-induced changes.  Methods:   In this pilot study, we performed targeted exosomal miRNA profiling of 25 serum samples obtained from PCa patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease treated with curative radiotherapy (RT), and controls. Post-treatment blood samples were collected at least 28 days after radiation therapy as a paired follow-up sample. The complete workflow consisted of two phases: I) filtration and polyethylene glycol salt precipitation phase which enriched particles below 200 nm in size followed by characterization using electron microscopy, and II) flow cytometry. Finally, miRNA expression analysis between untreated and treated patient samples was performed using RNA extraction kit, and qRT-PCR.  Results:   In our preliminary data, 1 ml of serum from PCa patients showed higher exosomal concentration (3.68E+10) compared to controls (6.07E+08). The overall expression of exosomes after RT was found to be higher compared to untreated samples; the median value changed from 3.68E+10 to 5.40E+10; p = 0.52. Using electron microscopy, we were able to visualize cup-shaped vesicles with morphology and size compatible with exosomes. The bead-based flow cytometry showed positivity for exosomal tetraspanins surface markers CD63 and CD9. All five miRNAs (hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-99b-5p) have been identified in exosomes. Despite overall changes in hsa-let-7a-5p expression after radiation, the difference was significant only in the high-risk group (p = 0.037). In addition, the radiation response to hsa-miR-21-5p was elevated in the high-risk group compared to the intermediate group (p = 0.036).  Conclusions:   Herewith, we demonstrated a protocol for isolation of serum exosomes and exosomal miRNA amplification. The recovery of exosomal miRNAs and their differential expression after radiation treatment suggests promising biomarker potential that requires further investigation in larger patient cohorts.""","""['Bijaya Malla', 'Daniel M Aebersold', 'Alan Dal Pra']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Identification of non-invasive biomarkers for chronic atrophic gastritis from serum exosomal microRNAs.', 'Differential expression of exosomal microRNAs in fresh and senescent apheresis platelet concentrates.', 'Exosomal microRNAs are novel circulating biomarkers in cigarette, waterpipe smokers, E-cigarette users and dual smokers.', ""Are circulating microRNAs peripheral biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease?"", 'Exosomal microRNA panels as biomarkers for hematological malignancies.', 'Effect of radiotherapy on the DNA cargo and cellular uptake mechanisms of extracellular vesicles.', 'Extracellular Vesicles in Liquid Biopsies as Biomarkers for Solid Tumors.', 'Mesenchymal stromal/stem cell-derived exosomes and genitourinary cancers: A mini review.', 'Small extracellular vesicles as a multicomponent biomarker platform in urinary tract carcinomas.', 'Blood circulating exosomes carrying microRNA-423-5p regulates cell progression in prostate cancer via targeting FRMD3.']"""

Methods:   Data were obtained from the European Huntington's disease network REGISTRY study for 6540 subjects. Population cancer incidence was ascertained from the GLOBOCAN database to obtain standardised incidence ratios of cancers in the REGISTRY subjects.  Results:   173/6528 HD REGISTRY subjects had had a cancer diagnosis. The age-standardised incidence rate of all cancers in the REGISTRY HD population was 0.26 (CI 0.22-0.30). Individual cancers showed a lower age-standardised incidence rate compared with the control population with prostate and colorectal cancers showing the lowest rates. There was no effect of CAG length on the likelihood of cancer, but a cancer diagnosis within the last year was associated with a greatly increased rate of HD onset (Hazard Ratio 18.94, p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Cancer is less common than expected in the HD population, confirming previous reports. However, this does not appear to be related to CAG length in HTT.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 124 consecutive patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical nephroureterectomy at Chiba Cancer Center, Chiba, Japan between 2002 and 2015. The albumin : globulin ratio was defined: albumin / (total protein - albumin). Associations between preoperative clinicopathological factors, including the albumin : globulin ratio, and recurrence-free survival, cancer-specific survival and overall survival were assessed. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models were used for univariate and multivariable analyses, respectively. The study cohort was separated into two groups based on the optimal albumin : globulin ratio cut-off value determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.  Results:   The median survival time was 55 months (interquartile range 28-76 months), and 31 patients died during follow up. A low preoperative albumin : globulin ratio <1.40 was associated with tumor grade and surgical margin status.

When not all relevant estimates are available, the model may have to be simplified. Multiparameter evidence synthesis combines data from diverse sources of evidence, which results in obtaining estimates required in clinical decision making that otherwise may not be available. We demonstrate how bivariate meta-analysis can be used to predict an unreported estimate of a treatment effect enabling implementation of a multistate Markov model, which otherwise needs to be simplified. To illustrate this, we used an example of cost-effectiveness analysis for docetaxel in combination with prednisolone in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Bivariate meta-analysis was used to model jointly available data on treatment effects on overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) to predict the unreported effect on PFS in a study evaluating docetaxel with prednisolone. The predicted treatment effect on PFS enabled implementation of a 3-state Markov model comprising stable disease, progressive disease, and dead states, while lack of the estimate restricted the model to a 2-state model (with alive and dead states). The 2-state and 3-state models were compared by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (which was much lower in the 3-state model: £22,148 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared to £30,026 obtained from the 2-state model) and the expected value of perfect information (which increased with the 3-state model). The 3-state model has the advantage of distinguishing surviving patients who progressed from those who did not progress. Hence, the use of advanced meta-analytic techniques allowed obtaining relevant parameter estimates to populate a model describing disease pathway in more detail while helping to prevent valuable clinical data from being discarded.""","""['Sze Huey Tan', 'Keith R Abrams', 'Sylwia Bujkiewicz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Decis Making""","""['Cabazitaxel for Hormone-Relapsed Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With a Docetaxel-Containing Regimen: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'TRAPEZE: a randomised controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of chemotherapy with zoledronic acid, strontium-89, or both, in men with bony metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer.', 'Value of information and value of implementation: application of an analytic framework to inform resource allocation decisions in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.', 'A systematic review and economic evaluation of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of aldosterone antagonists for postmyocardial infarction heart failure.', 'Prediction of overall survival for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: development of a prognostic model through a crowdsourced challenge with open clinical trial data.', 'Classifying information-sharing methods.', 'Health utility and health-related quality of life of Japanese prostate cancer patients according to progression status measured using EQ-5D-5L and FACT-P.']"""

Phenomenological RBE models have been developed to include such factors in the estimation of a variable RBE, in contrast to the clinically applied constant RBE of 1.1. In this study, eleven published phenomenological RBE models and two plan-based models were explored and applied to simulated patient cases. All models were analysed with respect to the distribution and range of linear energy transfer (LET) and reference radiation fractionation sensitivity ((α/β) x ) of their respective experimental databases. Proton therapy plans for a spread-out Bragg peak in water and three patient cases (prostate adenocarcinoma, pituitary adenoma and thoracic sarcoma) were optimised using an RBE of 1.1 in the Eclipse™ treatment planning system prior to recalculation and modelling in the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. Model estimated dose-volume parameters for the planning target volumes (PTVs) and organs at risk (OAR) were compared. The experimental in vitro databases for the various models differed greatly in the range of (α/β) x values and dose-averaged LET (LETd). There were significant variations between the model estimations, which arose from fundamental differences in the database definitions and model assumptions. The greatest variations appeared in organs with low (α/β) x and high LETd, e.g. biological doses given to late responding OARs located distal to the target in the treatment field. In general, the variation in maximum dose (D2%) was larger than the variation in mean dose and other dose metrics, with D2% of the left optic nerve ((α/β) x = 2.1 Gy) in the pituitary adenoma case showing the greatest discrepancies between models: 28-52 Gy(RBE), while D2% for RBE1.1 was 30 Gy(RBE). For all patient cases, the estimated mean RBE to the PTV was in the range 1.09-1.29 ((α/β) x = 1.5/3.1/10.6 Gy). There were considerable variations between the estimations of RBE and RBE-weighted doses from the different models. These variations were a consequence of fundamental differences in experimental databases, model assumptions and regression techniques. The results from the implementation of RBE models in dose planning studies should be evaluated in light of these deviations.""","""['Eivind Rørvik', 'Lars Fredrik Fjæra', 'Tordis J Dahle', 'Jon Espen Dale', 'Grete May Engeseth', 'Camilla H Stokkevåg', 'Sara Thörnqvist', 'Kristian S Ytre-Hauge']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Biological dose and complication probabilities for the rectum and bladder based on linear energy transfer distributions in spot scanning proton therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Variable RBE in proton therapy: comparison of different model predictions and their influence on clinical-like scenarios.', 'Modelling variable proton relative biological effectiveness for treatment planning.', 'Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values for proton beam therapy.

Methods and materials:   The prospective, population-based Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation study enrolled men with localized prostate cancer in 2011 to 2012. The 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite measured patient-reported disease-specific function at baseline and at 6, 12, and 36 months. Higher domain scores indicate better function. Minimal clinically important difference was defined as 6 for urinary incontinence, 5 for urinary irritative function, 4 for bowel function, 12 for sexual function, and 4 for hormonal function. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were fit to estimate the effect of treatment on patient-reported outcomes.  Results:   Five-hundred seventy-eight men received EBRT and 109 received EB-LDR. Median patient age was 69 years, and 70% had intermediate- or high-risk disease. Men in the EB-LDR group were younger (P < .001) and less likely to receive androgen deprivation therapy (P < .001). Baseline urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal function was similar between treatment groups (P > .05). On multivariable analyses, men receiving EB-LDR reported worse urinary irritative function at 6 months (adjusted mean difference [AMD] -14.4, P < .001), 12 months (AMD -12.9, P < .001), and 36 months (AMD -4.7, P = .034) than men receiving EBRT. At 12 months, men receiving EB-LDR reported worse bowel function (AMD -5.8, P = .002), but these differences were not seen at 36 months. There were no significant differences in sexual or hormone function between treatment groups.

Materials and methods:   463 tumor samples were assessed by double immunohistochemistry stains for ERG and PTEN and data correlated with clinical pathological features including, Gleason score, patients' outcome and ADT.  Results:   ERG expression and PTEN protein loss were present in 28.2% and 38% of total patients respectively. There was a significant interplay between ERG and PTEN expression with 21.8% PTEN negative tumors being ERG positive (p < 0.001). Both ERG and PTEN showed significant association with lethal disease in all patients and those treated with prior ADT representing castrate-resistant disease. However, only PTEN remained significant in multivariable proportional hazards regression analysis, when including Gleason score and patients' age. Depending on patient's subgroup, intact positive PTEN intensity showed better cancer-specific survival with HR ranging from 0.25 to 0.4 compared to tumors with loss of PTEN expression. Assessing combined marker status, patients with decreased PTEN intensity without ERG positivity showed the worst clinical outcome compared to those with no PTEN loss and no ERG expression, where they had best clinical outcome. Patients with ERG expression with or without PTEN loss showed intermediate risk in relation to lethal disease.

While genomic/epigenetic alterations are shown to induce neuroendocrine differentiation via an intermediate stem-like state, RNA splicing factor SRRM4 can transform AdPC cells into NEPC xenografts through a direct neuroendocrine transdifferentiation mechanism. Whether SRRM4 can also regulate a stem-cell gene network for NEPC development remains unclear.  Methods:   Multiple AdPC cell models were transduced by lentiviral vectors encoding SRRM4. SRRM4-mediated RNA splicing and neuroendocrine differentiation of cells and xenografts were determined by qPCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. Cell morphology, proliferation, and colony formation rates were also studied. SRRM4 transcriptome in the DU145 cell model was profiled by AmpliSeq and analyzed by gene enrichment studies.  Findings:   SRRM4 induces an overall NEPC-specific RNA splicing program in multiple cell models but creates heterogeneous transcriptomes. SRRM4-transduced DU145 cells present the most dramatic neuronal morphological changes, accelerated cell proliferation, and enhanced resistance to apoptosis. The derived xenografts show classic phenotypes similar to clinical NEPC. Whole transcriptome analyses further reveal that SRRM4 induces a pluripotency gene network consisting of the stem-cell differentiation gene, SOX2. While SRRM4 overexpression enhances SOX2 expression in both time- and dose-dependent manners in DU145 cells, RNA depletion of SOX2 compromises SRRM4-mediated stimulation of pluripotency genes. More importantly, this SRRM4-SOX2 axis is present in a subset of NEPC patient cohorts, patient-derived xenografts, and clinically relevant transgenic mouse models.  Interpretation:   We report a novel mechanism by which SRRM4 drives NEPC progression via a pluripotency gene network.

Methods:   In total, 1120 consecutive patients with PSA levels between 4.0 and 20.0 ng/mL were divided into the 12-core (552 patients) and 18-core TRUS biopsy (568 patients) groups. The clinical outcomes of the 12- and 18-core TRUS-biopsy groups were compared. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by comparing the prostate cancer detection rates and post-biopsy complication rates.

The risk is reduced in intensity-modulated radiotherapy compared with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. The effect of brachytherapy has been less extensively researched. Despite the increased dose to the gross tumour volume and decreased dose to organs at risk, previous studies have recommended avoidance of low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy in patients with IBD, due to increased bowel toxicity. We investigated the effect of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy in IBD.  Materials and methods:   Eleven IBD patients across four different sites (in the UK and Spain) who received HDR brachytherapy, between 2012 and 2015, were followed for up to 12 months. Acute bowel and urinary toxicity data were collected and recorded.  Results:   The median length of follow-up was 6 months (range between 6 weeks and 12 months). Five patients had Crohn's disease and six patients had ulcerative colitis. Only one patient (with Crohn's disease) had active disease at the time of treatment. This patient reported no bowel toxicity. Of the remaining patients, two suffered grade 1 diarrhoea (at 6 weeks and 6 months); three suffered grade 1 proctitis (at 6 weeks and 6 months). There was no grade ≥2 bowel toxicity. The most severe toxicity was grade 2 urinary frequency in one patient (at 6 weeks).  Discussion:   This small, prospective case series suggests that, in the short term, HDR brachytherapy is safe and well tolerated in IBD patients. Therefore, IBD should not automatically disqualify patients from, at least, HDR brachytherapy. The reason why these results differ from previous LDR studies possibly reflects the benefit of inverse planning, which more readily achieves rectal dose constraints in HDR brachytherapy.""","""['W Mohammed', 'P Hoskin', 'A Henry', 'A Gomez-Iturriaga', 'A Robinson', 'A Nikapota']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Long-Term Toxicity of High Dose Rate Brachytherapy in Prostate Carcinoma Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.', 'A new model using number of needles and androgen deprivation to predict chronic urinary toxicity for high or low dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Low Toxicity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients Treated With Abdominal and Pelvic Radiation Therapy.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Curative radiotherapy of localized prostate cancer.

Understanding mechanisms of resistance, including androgen receptor reactivation, is crucial for development of more efficacious CRPC therapies. Here, we report that the RON receptor tyrosine kinase is highly expressed in the majority of human hormone-refractory prostate cancers. Further, we show that exogenous expression of RON in human and murine prostate cancer cells circumvents sensitivity to androgen deprivation and promotes prostate cancer cell growth in both in vivo and in vitro settings. Conversely, RON loss induces sensitivity of CRPC cells to androgen deprivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that RON overexpression leads to activation of multiple oncogenic transcription factors (namely, β-catenin and NF-κB), which are sufficient to drive androgen receptor nuclear localization and activation of AR responsive genes under conditions of androgen deprivation and support castration-resistant growth.

Methods:   An mCRPC database of patients receiving first-line docetaxel and rechallenge courses was established. Several clinical factors were evaluated for prediction of treatment response. Multivariate cox-regression analysis was used to define pre-treatment and treatment factors for survival.  Results:   Between 2005 and 2013, 94 patients with mCRPC were treated with docetaxel. Full data set and follow-up were available for 62 patients. Median follow-up was 84 m [interquartile range (IQR) 64-104 m]. Median biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) and overall survival under docetaxel were 9 m (IQR 5-16 m) and 20 m (IQR 16-26 m), respectively. Partial PSA-response at first docetaxel-sequence (n = 62), rechallenge (n = 32), and third-sequence (n = 22) docetaxel was 48.4%, 31.6%, and 34.8%, respectively. Time from start of primary androgen deprivation to CRPC > 47 m was the only independent pre-treatment parameter to predict improved overall survival (Hazard Ratio 0.48, p = 0.015). Interestingly, there was a strong trend for improved overall survival in patients with high Gleason Score (Hazard Ratio 0.58; p = 0.08). Partial PSA-response at docetaxel-rechallenge (Hazard Ratio 0.31; p = 0.008) and treatment-free interval > 3 m (Hazard Ratio 3.49; p = 0.014) were the only independent predictive factors under taxane treatment for overall survival.  Conclusion:   Despite novel hormonal drugs, docetaxel still plays an important role in the treatment of mCRPC.

Therefore, we sought to establish the cellular and gene regulatory consequences of reduced RARγ expression, and determine RARγ regulatory mechanisms. RARG shRNA approaches in non-malignant (RWPE-1 and HPr1-AR) and malignant (LNCaP) prostate models revealed that reducing RARγ levels, rather than adding exogenous retinoid ligand, had the greatest impact on prostate cell viability and gene expression. ChIP-Seq defined the RARγ cistrome, which was significantly enriched at active enhancers associated with AR binding sites. Reflecting a significant genomic role for RARγ to regulate androgen signaling, RARγ knockdown in HPr1-AR cells significantly regulated the magnitude of the AR transcriptome. RARγ downregulation was explained by increased miR-96 in PCa cell and mouse models, and TCGA PCa cohorts. Biochemical approaches confirmed that miR-96 directly regulated RARγ expression and function. Capture of the miR-96 targetome by biotin-miR-96 identified that RARγ and a number of RARγ interacting co-factors including TACC1 were all targeted by miR-96, and expression of these genes were prominently altered, positively and negatively, in the TCGA-PRAD cohort. Differential gene expression analyses between tumors in the TCGA-PRAD cohort with lower quartile expression levels of RARG and TACC1 and upper quartile miR-96, compared to the reverse, identified a gene network including several RARγ target genes (e.g., SOX15) that significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (hazard ratio 2.23, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.88, p = 0.015).

Specifically, we discovered Y260 in α1 Na/K-ATPase as a Src-specific phosphorylation and binding site and that Y260 phosphorylation is required for Src-mediated signal transduction in response to a number of stimuli including EGF. As such, it enables a dynamic control of aerobic glycolysis. However, such regulation appears to be lost or attenuated in human cancers as the expression of Na/K-ATPase α1 was significantly decreased in prostate, breast and kidney cancers, and further reduced in corresponding metastatic lesions in patient samples. Consistently, knockdown of α1 Na/K-ATPase led to a further increase in lactate production and the growth of tumor xenograft.

PSMA is a type II transmembrane protein with high expression in prostate carcinoma cells. We prospectively evaluated the use of 68Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with prostate cancer and compared the results to those for technetium-99m (99mTc)-10-metacyloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP) bone scintigraphy (BS).  Patients and methods:   A total 113 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer referred for standard-of-care BS were prospectively enrolled onto this study. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was performed after BS. Metastasis diagnosed on each technique was compared against a final diagnosis based on CT, magnetic resonance imaging, skeletal survey, clinical follow-up, and histologic correlation.  Results:   Ninety-one bone lesions were interpreted as bone metastases in 25 men undergoing 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT compared to only 61 lesions in 19 men undergoing 99mTc-MDP BS. Of the 7 bone scans that missed skeletal metastases, 54% of these missed lesions were due to either marrow or lytic skeletal metastases. The median standardized uptake value in all malignant bone lesions was 13.84. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT showed significantly higher sensitivity and accuracy than BS (96.2% vs. 73.1%, and 99.1% vs. 84.1%) for the detection of skeletal lesions. For extraskeletal lesions, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT showed an additional 96 unexpected lesions with a median standardized uptake value of 17.6.

Due to its heterogeneity and high variability in regards to clinical outcome and therapeutic response, urologists' handling of this disease remains a challenge. The objective of this study was to assess Transketolase like 1 (TKTL1) expression in benign prostatic tissue, peritumoral tissue and in CaP (in different stages of disease), and its correlation with clinicopathological findings, in order to detect if TKTL1 expression is associated with CaP tumorigenesis.  Methods:   In total, 100 tissue samples were included: (i) 22 benign specimens, (ii) 46 specimens with nonmetastatic CaP, and (iii) 32 specimens from patients with metastatic CaP. From the tissue microarray slides, we evaluated immunohistochemically the expression of the TKTL1 protein, using the H-score.  Results:   The TKTL1 protein expression pattern ranges from a low level in benign prostatic tissue (100 [57.5-105]), moderately low in peritumoral tissue (135.42 [100-195.16]), moderate expression in nonmetastatic CaP (200 [172.19-254.38]) to high in metastatic CaP (300 [222.50-300]). A significant rise of TKTL1 mean expression was seen throughout disease progression. A significant difference was also found in TKTL1 expression between peritumoral tissue and benign tissue.

Our aim was to evaluate the influence of primary treatment with curative intent for these patients on the development of second primary tumours.  Material and methods:   A retrospective study of 286 patients diagnosed between 1996 and 2008, treated by radical prostatectomy (n=145) or radiotherapy and androgen blockade (n=141). The homogeneity of both series was analysed using the Chi-squared test for the qualitative variables, and the Student's t-test for the quantitative variables. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to assess whether the type of primary treatment influenced the development of second tumours.  Results:   The median age was 66 years, and the median follow-up was 117.5 months. At the end of follow-up, 60 patients (21%) had developed a second primary tumour. In the prostatectomy group it was located in the pelvis in 13 (9%) cases, and those treated with radiotherapy and hormonotherapy in 8 (5.7%) cases (P=.29). The most common organ sites were: colo-rectal in 17 (28.3%) patients, the lung in 11 (18.3%), and the bladder in 6 (10%) patients. In the multivariable analysis, the risk of a second tumour doubled for those treated with radiotherapy and hormonotherapy (HR=2.41, 95%CI: 1.31-4.34, P=.005) compared to the patients treated by prostatectomy.

A morbidly obese patient with favorable-risk prostate cancer elected treatment with SBRT. The patient was treated with the avoidance arcs across the pannus to eliminate reproducibility issues created by daily pannus variability in set up. For post-treatment assessment, the case was planned using Varian Eclipse™ treatment planning system (TPS) with two VMAT arcs with and without 100° avoidance sectors across the pannus. The dose was re-calculated using the external body contour from four daily treatment cone-beam computer tomography scans, and on two virtual body contours created by expanding the pannus region of the external contour by 5 and 10 mm. Dose differences between planned and re-calculated rectal wall mean dose and the V24Gy were numerically larger in the absence of the avoidance sector for all fractions and for both simulated pannus variations, with maximum changes of 2.6% and 1.3%. Maximum point dose variations in the PTV, CTV, rectum, bladder, and femoral heads were 105 cGy or less for all cases, with and without the avoidance sector. The use of an avoidance sector across this large, asymmetrical pannus did not inhibit achieving dose constraints and provided a reduction in dose variability which was nominal in this case for 10 mm variations.

Our goal was to examine the association between urinary and fecal microbial profiles and the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PC) in patients undergoing transrectal biopsy of the prostate.  Materials and methods:   We extracted total DNA from urine and fecal samples collected before a prostate biopsy performed for elevated prostatic specific antigen in patients suspected of having PC. We then amplified the extracted DNA and sequenced it using bacterial 16S rRNA gene high-throughput next-generation sequencing platform, and analyzed microbial profiles for taxonomy comparing those patients diagnosed with PC with those who did not receive that diagnosis.  Results:   We included 30 patients in our analysis (60 samples, one urine and one fecal per patient). The majority of patients with PC (10/14) had similar bacterial communities within their urinary sample profile and clustered separately than patients without cancer (n = 16). Differential analysis of the operational taxonomical units (OTUs) in urine samples revealed decreased abundance of several bacterial species in patients with prostate cancer. Analysis of the bacterial taxonomies of the fecal samples did not reveal any clustering in concordance with benign or malignant prostate biopsies. Patients who had a Gleason score (GS) of 6 (n = 11) were present in both urine bacterial community clusters, but patients with GS 7 or higher (n = 3) did not cluster tightly with non-cancer subjects.  Conclusions:   The urinary microbiota of patients with PC tends to cluster separately from those without this disease. Further research is needed to investigate the urinary microbiome potential of serving as a biomarker that could be used to improve the accuracy of pre-biopsy models predicting the presence of PC in post-biopsy tissue examination.""","""['Shaheen Alanee', 'Ahmed El-Zawahry', 'Danuta Dynda', 'Ali Dabaja', 'Kevin McVary', 'Mallory Karr', 'Andrea Braundmeier-Fleming']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prospective examination of the changes in the urinary microbiome induced by transrectal biopsy of the prostate using 16S rRNA gene analysis.', 'Profiling the Urinary Microbiome in Men with Positive versus Negative Biopsies for Prostate Cancer.', 'The effect of the urinary and faecal microbiota on lower urinary tract symptoms measured by the International Prostate Symptom Score: analysis utilising next-generation sequencing.', 'The Microbiome and Genitourinary Cancer: A Collaborative Review.', 'The Microbiome and Prostate Cancer Risk.', 'Insights into the Human Microbiome and Its Connections with Prostate Cancer.', 'The human microbiome links to prostate cancer risk and treatment (Review).', 'Investigating the oral microbiome in retrospective and prospective cases of prostate, colon, and breast cancer.', 'Microbiota of Urine, Glans and Prostate Biopsies in Patients with Prostate Cancer Reveals a Dysbiosis in the Genitourinary System.', 'Bacteria and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment.']"""

The prevalence of PCa varies within Nigeria, with the highest prevalence of 1046 per 100,000 in men over the age of 40 reported in Lagos. Unfortunately, 40% of these men are diagnosed with locally advanced disease and 35% with metastatic disease. Given the ability to screen for PCa among high-risk individuals, late stage diagnosis of PCa could be potentially reduced through education of men so that they seek screening. Along these lines, it is important to assess a population's knowledge and awareness on PCa and screening. Our study addresses this issue by evaluating awareness and attitudes of Nigerian men in Abuja on PCa and screening. Our results revealed gaps in awareness and perception of susceptibility to PCa and low levels of PCa screening. Factors such as age, education level, and income affected PCa awareness. In conclusion, our study points to the need to educate younger men of lower education and socioeconomic status in Nigeria with the aim to increase screening and earlier detection of PCa.""","""['Paraskevi A Farazi', 'Mohammad Siahpush', 'Shannon Maloney', 'Danae Dinkel', 'Arthur Michalek', 'Rahama John', 'Olabode Oluwole']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Prostate cancer awareness and screening practice among Kenyan men.', 'Prevalence and characteristics of prostate cancer among participants of a community-based screening in Nigeria using serum prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination.', 'Men in rural Nigeria have a poor perception of prostate cancer risk; Hence they seldom seek screening.', 'Enhancing public awareness and practice of prostate cancer screening among African men: A scoping review.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Prostate Cancer awareness in the Lebanese population: a cross sectional national survey.', 'Prostate cancer knowledge gaps among community stakeholders in rural Nigeria: implications for seeking screening.']"""

Inclusion criteria were unilateral MRI detected CSC, stage ≤ T2b, Gleason score (GS) ≤ 7, at least 6 mm distant from prostate apex. MRI with systematic and targeted biopsies was performed at diagnosis. Follow-up included clinical examination, PSA every 6 month, MRI and biopsies at 1 year and in case of PSA elevation. HIFU retreatment was possible. Whole-gland treatment was indicated in case of positive biopsies with GS ≥ 7 or maximum cancer core length > 5 mm, any GS.  Results:   Mean follow-up was 33 months (SD: 17-49 months).

However, it is unknown whether serum levels of these proteins are altered in PC patients with or without metastasis. The aim of this study was to assess DKK-1 and sclerostin serum levels in PC patients, including patients with bone metastases.  Methods:   The study cohort (N = 143) consisted of 53 controls with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 43 with localized PC (PC cM0), and 47 had PC with metastasis (PC cM1). Serum levels of DKK-1 and sclerostin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis tests; post hoc analysis was performed using the Tukey-Kramer test.  Results:   Mean DKK-1 levels in patients with BPH (2809.4 pg/ml) (p < 0.001) as well as PC cM1 (2575.5 pg/ml) (p = 0.001) were significantly higher than in patients with PC cN0 cM0 (1551.8 pg/ml). Among PC cM1 patients, median DKK-1 levels were significantly lower in patients with castration-resistant disease compared to those with hormone-sensitive PC (p = 0.02); in contrast, sclerostin concentrations were elevated (p = 0.04). DKK-1 correlated with PSA in the cM1 group (p = 0.03) and sclerostin correlated with PSA in the PC group (0.01).  Conclusions:   DKK-1 is involved in the progression of PC. DKK-1-mediated inhibition of osteoblasts, which contributes to tumor progression and osteolytic metastases, may also play a role in the development of metastases with osteoblastic features.

However, how many noncoding transcripts such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) function in cancer is still unclear. This study identified a novel set of clinically relevant androgen-regulated lncRNAs in prostate cancer. Among this group, LINC00844 was demonstrated to be a direct androgen-regulated target that is actively transcribed in androgen receptor (AR)-dependent prostate cancer cells. The expression of LINC00844 is higher in normal prostate compared with malignant and metastatic prostate cancer clinical specimens, and patients with low expression had a poor prognosis and significantly increased biochemical recurrence, suggesting LINC00844 functions in suppressing tumor progression and metastasis. Indeed, in vitro loss-of-function studies revealed that LINC00844 prevents prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, findings from gene expression profiling analysis indicated that LINC00844 functions in trans, affecting global androgen-regulated gene transcription. Mechanistic evidence reveals that LINC00844 is important in facilitating AR binding to the chromatin. Finally, LINC00844 mediates its phenotypic effects in part by activating the expression of NDRG1, a crucial cancer metastasis suppressor. Collectively, LINC00844 is a novel coregulator of AR that plays a central role in the androgen transcriptional network and the development and progression of prostate cancer.

For many histologies, the spine is a frequent site for bone metastases. This predilection is not fully understood, and there are conflicting reports regarding the distribution within the vertebral body itself. Knowing this distribution will give clues as to the underlying biologic reason for this increased incidence in the spine and lead to a better understanding of tumor dispersion and growth.  Methods:   We retrospectively examined magnetic resonance imaging scans of patients undergoing radiation to the spine from 2015 to 2017 for spinal metastases. The anatomical distribution of lesions was categorized. Lesions were sorted along the sagittal plane into 5 groups: anterior only, anterior + middle, middle only, posterior + middle, and posterior only. Lesions that covered all groups were discarded. χ2 and post-hoc analyses were used for statistical analyses.  Results:   Three hundred metastatic lesions were examined in 89 patients; 203 lesions were used for analysis. Sixty-five percent of all lesions were found in posterior only and posterior + middle aspects of the vertebral body (P < 0.0001). This localization was significant regardless of histology: lung (67%, P < 0.0001), kidney (66%, P < 0.0001), sarcoma (67%, P < 0.0001), prostate (63%, P = 0.01), and breast (63%, P = 0.01). This was consistent across thoracic (n = 96) and lumbar (n = 63) regions (72% and 64%, respectively, P < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Metastatic lesions of the thoracolumbar spine have a greater propensity to localize to the posterior aspect of the vertebral body.

However, to our knowledge the association between age and biopsy grade reclassification to an aggressive phenotype (Gleason score 4 + 3 or greater [Grade Group 3 or greater]) has not been explored.  Materials and methods:   From 1995 to 2016 we followed 1,625 men 41 to 81 years old with NCCN® (National Comprehensive Cancer Network®) very low (68%) or low (32%) risk prostate cancer on active surveillance. We determined the rate of biopsy grade reclassification to Grade Group 3 or greater. Competing risk analysis was applied to evaluate the association between age at enrollment and the risk of biopsy grade reclassification. Additionally, in men who underwent radical prostatectomy after biopsy grade reclassification we assessed the rate of radical prostatectomy grade reclassification (ie radical prostatectomy Grade Group greater than biopsy Grade Group).  Results:   The 5-year incidence of biopsy grade reclassification to Grade Group 3 or greater was 4%, 7% and 14% in men younger than 60, 60 to 69 and 70 years old or older, respectively (p <0.001).

In men who underwent radical prostatectomy after biopsy grade reclassification those who were older had a higher rate of radical prostatectomy grade reclassification (p <0.05).  Conclusions:   In men on active surveillance older age at diagnosis was positively associated with biopsy grade reclassification to Grade Group 3 or greater and radical prostatectomy grade reclassification.

Here, we used MTMSA (2) to generate analogues via peptide coupling and fragment-based drug development strategies. Cytotoxicity assays in ETS and non-ETS dependent cell lines identified two dipeptide analogues, 60 and 61, with 19.1- and 15.6-fold selectivity, respectively, compared to 1.5-fold for 1. Importantly, the cytotoxicity of 60 and 61 is <100 nM in ETS cells. Molecular assays demonstrated the inhibitory capacity of these analogues against EWS-FLI1 mediated transcription in Ewing sarcoma. Structural analysis shows that positioning the tryptophan residue in a distal position improves selectivity, presumably via interaction with the ETS transcription factor.

Chronic arsenic exposure causes multiple cancers including those originating from skin, lung and bladder, and is associated with liver, kidney, and prostate cancers. Skin is the primary target organ for arsenic toxicity; chronic toxicity initially manifests as non-malignant hyperkeratoses (HK) and subsequently advances to malignant lesions, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In this study, we evaluate the miRNA expression profiles of premalignant (3 HK) and malignant (3 BCC and 3 SCC) skin lesions from individuals chronically exposed to high levels of arsenic (59-172 ppb) in their drinking water in West Bengal, India. The lesions were histologically complex requiring histopathologic identification of keratinocytes to be isolated for RNA analyses. Keratinocytes were harvested using Laser Capture Microdissection and miRNA expression profiles were determined using TaqMan® Array Human MiRNA A Card v2.0. Thirty-five miRNAs were differentially expressed among the three lesion types analyzed. Two miRNAs (miR-425-5p and miR-433) were induced in both BCC and SCC relative to HK indicating their association with malignancy. Two other miRNAs (miR-184 and miR-576-3p) were induced in SCC relative to both BCC and HK suggesting selective induction in tumors capable of metastasis. Six miRNAs (miR-29c, miR-381, miR-452, miR-487b, miR-494 and miR-590-5p) were selectively suppressed in BCC relative to both SCC and HK. In conclusion, the differential miRNA expression was both phenotype- and stage-related.

Methods:   Our contribution is threefold. First, we develop a new edge detector derived from the radial bas-relief approach, allowing for better scalar prostate edge detection in low contrast configurations. Second, we combine an edge-based force derived from the proposed edge detector with a new region-based force driven by the Bhattacharyya gradient flow and adapted to the case of parametric active surfaces. Finally, we develop a quasi-automatic initialization technique for deformable models by analyzing the profiles of the proposed edge detector response radially to obtain initial landmark points toward which an initial surface model is warped.  Results:   We validate our method on a set of 36 TRUS images for which manual delineations were performed by two expert radiation oncologists, using a wide variety of quantitative metrics. The proposed hybrid model achieved state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.  Conclusion:   Results demonstrate the interest of the proposed hybrid framework for accurate prostate volume segmentation.

Patients and methods:   All patients diagnosed with Gleason 3 + 3 prostate cancer because of a raised PSA level who underwent mpMRI after diagnosis were included. Patients were recorded in a prospective clinical database and followed up with PSA monitoring and repeat MRI. In patients who remained on active surveillance after the first MRI (with or without confirmatory biopsy), we investigated PSA dynamics for association with subsequent progression. Comparison between first and second MRI scans was undertaken. Outcomes assessed were: progression to radical therapy at first MRI/confirmatory biopsy and progression to radical therapy in those who remained on active surveillance after first MRI.  Results:   A total of 211 patients were included, with a median of 4.2 years of follow-up. The rate of progression to radical therapy was significantly greater at all stages among patients with visible lesions than in those with initially negative MRI (47/125 (37.6%) vs 11/86 (12.8%); odds ratio 4.1 (95% CI 2.0-8.5), P < 0.001).

Nanoscale flow cytometry (nFC) is ideal for high-throughput analysis of PMPs but these clinical assays have not been developed previously.  Objective:   This article demonstrates that nFC is a suitable technology to enumerate PMPs present in plasma samples in a clinical setting.  Materials and methods:   nFC was performed using the Apogee A50-Micro instrument. Instrument settings and acquisition parameters were developed with the use of fluorescent beads and plasma samples. Sample preparation and handling was also optimized.  Results:   nFC allows for linear detection of particles between approximately 200 and 1,000 nm based on calibration beads and was dependent on dilution factor and flow rate. Linearity in event analysis as samples became more diluted was lost when events approximately 100 nm were gated while linearity was maintained despite dilution of sample in events larger than 200 nm in diameter. Higher flow rates lead to an under-estimation of events analysed per microlitre of analyte and this was more pronounced when plasma samples were not diluted more than 1/20×.  Conclusion:   nFC offers multi-parametric analysis of PMPs when optimal calibration of acquisition and sample processing settings is performed.

However, the experiences of partners of high-risk (1 in 4) Black African (BA) and Black Caribbean (BC) men with CaP remain poorly understood as existing research has predominantly focused on Caucasian populations. This study aimed to address this gap by exploring partners' experience and support needs as influenced both by the specific impacts of CaP, treatment side effects and socio-cultural context.  Methods:   Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, eight face-to-face, two Skype and one telephone interviews were conducted with eligible partners (n = 11). The interviews were analysed using constant comparison following key stages of open, focused and theoretical coding.  Results:   Three broad categories emerged which described participants' experiences: 'partner in the passenger seat', 'care-giving on an isolating journey', and 'coping as a partner'. Findings showed that BA and BC cultural marital context influenced how partners experienced and traversed the CaP journey. Peripheral involvement in decision-making, communication restrictions, limited access to support and lack of recognition for their experiences and needs further contributed to partners' psychological and emotional distress.  Conclusions:   Cultural beliefs, behaviours and values should be taken into account when developing psychosocial support for partners and their men with CaP. Specifically providing information focused on partners and including them in the CaP care pathway could help ensure that partners' needs are recognised and improve marital communications. This could potentially help partners and their men to identify acceptable ways of supporting each other throughout the CaP experience.""","""['O Bamidele', 'B M Lagan', 'H McGarvey', 'D Wittmann', 'E McCaughan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['""Man in the driving seat"": A grounded theory study of the psychosocial experiences of Black African and Black Caribbean men treated for prostate cancer and their partners.', 'A constructivist grounded theory study on decision-making for treatment choice among Black African and Black Caribbean prostate cancer survivors.', 'Life after prostate cancer: A systematic literature review and thematic synthesis of the post-treatment experiences of Black African and Black Caribbean men.', 'Adjustment strategies amongst black African and black Caribbean men following treatment for prostate cancer: Findings from the Life After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis (LAPCD) study.', 'Psychosocial adjustment of female partners of men with prostate cancer: a review of the literature.', ""'Out of the frying pan into the fire': a qualitative study of the impact on masculinity for men living with advanced prostate cancer.""]"""

Monomers of lactide, ε-caprolactone, and polyethylene-glycol were utilized to prepare pentablock copolymer by ring opening technique. The pentablock nanomicelles (PBNM) were formulated by evaporation and rehydration. Both copolymers and nanomicelles were analyzed by H-NMR, FTIR, and XRD. Nanomicelles were further analyzed for size and zeta potential using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and by H-NMR and TEM. The XRD, FTIR, and H-NMR analyses confirmed the structures of the pentablock copolymers. Average size was 20 nm ± 5.00 nm, and ζ-potential is around zero. H-NMR and FTIR analyses for Paclitaxel-PBNM indicated peaks of paclitaxel and the polymer, confirming successful encapsulation. TEM showed spherical morphology and size range similar to that obtained by DLS. In vitro release studies revealed slow first-order paclitaxel release rate from pentablock nanomicelles in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis with coumarin-6-loaded in PBNM indicated that pentablock nanomicelles were efficiently taken into prostate cancer (PC-3) cells. Cell proliferation assay showed that nanomicelles were able to ferry adequate amounts of paclitaxel drug into PC-3 cells and subsequently inhibiting PC-3 cell proliferation significantly.

The present study evaluated the antitumor effect of the tetracyclic triterpene alcohol, euphol, the main constituent of E. tirucalli in a panel of 73 human cancer lines from 15 tumor types. The biological effect of euphol in pancreatic cells was also assessed. The combination index was further used to explore euphol interactions with standard drugs. Euphol showed a cytotoxicity effect against several cancer cell lines (IC50 range, 1.41-38.89 µM), particularly in esophageal squamous cell (11.08 µM) and pancreatic carcinoma cells (6.84 µM), followed by prostate, melanoma, and colon cancer. Cytotoxicity effects were seen in all cancer cell lines, with more than half deemed highly sensitive. Euphol inhibited proliferation, motility and colony formation in pancreatic cancer cells. Importantly, euphol exhibited synergistic interactions with gemcitabine and paclitaxel in pancreatic and esophageal cell lines, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this study constitutes the largest in vitro screening of euphol efficacy on cancer cell lines and revealed its in vitro anti-cancer properties, particularly in pancreatic and esophageal cell lines, suggesting that euphol, either as a single agent or in combination with conventional chemotherapy, is a potential anti-cancer drug.""","""['Viviane Aline Oliveira Silva', 'Marcela Nunes Rosa', 'Aline Tansini', 'Renato J S Oliveira', 'Olga Martinho', 'João Paulo Lima', 'Luiz F Pianowski', 'Rui M Reis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Exp Ther Med""","""['Euphol, a tetracyclic triterpene, from Euphorbia tirucalli induces autophagy and sensitizes temozolomide cytotoxicity on glioblastoma cells.', 'Modified ingenol semi-synthetic derivatives from Euphorbia tirucalli induce cytotoxicity on a large panel of human cancer cell lines.', 'Analytical methods to access the chemical composition of an Euphorbia tirucalli anticancer latex from traditional Brazilian medicine.', 'Pharmacokinetics and cytotoxic study of euphol from Euphorbia umbellata (Bruyns) Pax latex.', 'Bioactive Secondary Plant Metabolites from Euphorbia umbellata (PAX) BRUYNS (Euphorbiaceae).', 'Euphol from Tapinanthus sp.

Recent evidence suggests TAM phagocytose apoptotic tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment through efferocytosis in an immunologically silent manner, thus maintaining an immunosuppressed microenvironment. The signal transduction pathways coupling efferocytosis and immunosuppression are not well known. Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) is a member of the membrane-associated neuropilin family and has been reported in different immune cells but is poorly characterized. In this study, we show that NRP2 is expressed during macrophage differentiation, is induced by tumor cells, and regulates phagocytosis in macrophages. Furthermore, NRP2 in TAM promoted efferocytosis and facilitated tumor growth. Deletion of NRP2 from TAM impaired the clearance of apoptotic tumor cells and increased secondary necrosis within tumors. This resulted in a break in the immune tolerance and reinitiated antitumor immune responses, characterized by robust infiltration of CD8+ T and natural killer cells. This result suggests NRP2 may act as a molecular mediator that connects efferocytosis and immune suppression. Deletion of NRP2 in TAM downregulated several immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting genes and upregulated immunostimulatory genes in the myeloid compartment. Taken together, our study demonstrates that TAM-derived NRP2 plays a crucial role in tumor promotion through efferocytosis, opening the enticing option for the development of effective immunotherapy targeting TAM.Significance: Neuropilin-2 in macrophages promotes tumor growth by regulating efferocytosis of apoptotic tumor cells and orchestrating immune suppression.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/19/5600/F1.large.jpg Cancer Res; 78(19); 5600-17. ©2018 AACR.""","""['Sohini Roy', 'Arup K Bag', 'Samikshan Dutta', 'Navatha Shree Polavaram', 'Ridwan Islam', 'Samuel Schellenburg', 'Jasjit Banwait', 'Chittibabu Guda', 'Sophia Ran', 'Michael A Hollingsworth', 'Rakesh K Singh', 'James E Talmadge', 'Michael H Muders', 'Surinder K Batra', 'Kaustubh Datta']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Paclitaxel Reduces Tumor Growth by Reprogramming Tumor-Associated Macrophages to an M1 Profile in a TLR4-Dependent Manner.', 'Targeting MARCO and IL37R on Immunosuppressive Macrophages in Lung Cancer Blocks Regulatory T Cells and Supports Cytotoxic Lymphocyte Function.', 'Isoforms of Neuropilin-2 Denote Unique Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Breast Cancer.', 'Role of neuropilin-2 in the immune system.', 'Phagocytic function of tumor-associated macrophages as a key determinant of tumor progression control: a review.', 'Siglec-9 acts as an immune-checkpoint molecule on macrophages in glioblastoma, restricting T-cell priming and immunotherapy response.', 'Comprehensive analysis of the oncogenic roles of vascular endothelial growth factors and their receptors in stomach adenocarcinoma.', 'Gas6/AXL pathway: immunological landscape and therapeutic potential.', 'Immune Checkpoint Neuropilins as Novel Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Immune cell dynamics deconvoluted by single-cell RNA sequencing in normothermic machine perfusion of the liver.']"""

A spatial, temporal and structural analysis""","""Introduction:   This study investigates spatial distribution and future trends in prostate cancer mortality in Poland. Since detection of prostate cancer is based on patients’ requests (not an invitation system), hypothesis of self-selection of patients was also verified  Material and methods:   Age-period-cohort model was estimated to assess mortality trends. A spatial analysis was performed by Kulldorff’s and Moran’s tests. Structural equation model was fitted to identify factors influencing decision on participation in prostate cancer screening. Statistical analysis is based on data from the National Cancer Registry for 1980-2014 and a 2014 questionnaire survey of 1,700 men aged 45+.  Results:   The annual number of registered deaths due to prostate cancer is expected to increase from 4,440 in 2014 to 6,550 in 2030. Prostate cancer mortality in Poland is to a large extent spatially uniform (global Moran’s Ig=0.066) and was not found to be related to spatial patterns in oral contraceptive use in women which was recently hypothesised. Nevertheless, a Kulldorff’s cluster can be identified over the Lubusz and Greater Poland areas for both the 1980-1984 and the 2010-2014 periods (p<0.001). The structural equation model showed that the early detection of prostate cancer is influenced mainly by physician’s activeness and local availability of healthcare (p<0.050). The direct effect of socio-economic status on early detection of prostate cancer is insignificant.  Conclusions:   When considering prediction results, one should request more actions aimed at facing the upward trend of deaths, including making research funding in prostate cancer a priority, improving understanding of prostate cancer among males, and offering to patients individualised risk-adapted strategy modelled on the guidelines of the European Association of Urology.

While such results may be generalizable, they often lack the detail necessary to understand provider clinical decision making and guideline concordance. Using a retrospective study of PSA testing at our institution we intend to characterize the frequency and patterns associated with low-value PSA testing.  Methods:   We leveraged the electronic health record to determine guideline-defined low-value testing in our health system from 07/01/2012 to 06/30/2017. Secondarily, we measured the between-testing interval for repeat tests and the rates of prostate cancer risk factors and comorbidities among men receiving screening.  Results:   Overall, 21,145 PSA tests were performed on 12,303 men. The rate of low-value testing ranged from 23.4 to 56.8%, depending upon the specific guideline. For repeat tests, the median between-testing interval was 12.6 months. Risk factors for prostate cancer were uncommon, but more frequent in men age <55 years compared to men age 55-69 years (17.6% vs. 13.5%, p < 0.001). Screened older men (age >70 years) were more likely to have a Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥ 3, compared to the 55-69 reference group (31.4% vs. 17.3%, p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Low-value prostate cancer testing is prevalent. Between-testing intervals were often times shorter than recommended. Screening among younger men was frequent despite low rates of risk factors. High rates of comorbidity may limit life expectancy among older men receiving screening.

The expression and function of PARP9 in human breast cancer remains unknown. In the present study, it was demonstrated that PARP9 is frequently overexpressed in human breast cancer. In 57 normal breast tissues, the expression of PARP9 was not detected in 43 cases (75.4%), but low levels of PARP9 were detected in 13 cases (22.8%), and modest levels of PARP9 (PARP9/GAPDH ratio ~1:1) were detected in only 1 case (1.7%). In contrast, the expression of PARP9 was detected in all 57 breast cancer tissues, in which the levels of PARP9 were higher than that in paired normal breast tissues. In addition, high levels of PARP9 were detected in 43.8% of breast cancer tissues. Overexpression of PARP9 was negatively associated with estrogen receptor expression, and positively associated with axillary lymph node metastasis. However, PARP9 expression was not associated with other clinicopathological parameters, including age, HER-2 and tumor size. Furthermore, PARP9-knockdown inhibited breast cancer cell migration.

To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to investigate the efficacy of the Traditional Chinese Medicine astragaloside on tumor growth and the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. In addition, further investigation into the underlying molecular mechanisms via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway was also performed. In the present study, the human prostate cancer DU-145 cell line was employed as an experimental model in vitro and cells were divided into five treatment groups: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) group (control), low-dose astragaloside group (L-As; 20 nmol/l), moderate-dose astragaloside group (M-As; 50 nmol/l), high-dose astragaloside group (H-As, 100 nmol/l) and ER stress suppressor group (tauroursodeoxycholic acid; TUDCA). The proliferative ability and apoptosis rate of the DU-145 cells were detected via Cell Counting kit-8 methods and flow cytometry, respectively. Furthermore, the ER stress factors [binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and caspase-12] were assessed through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, the protein expression levels of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), phosphorylated protein kinase R-like ER kinase (p-PERK), iron-regulated transcriptional activator Aft (AFT)4 and AFT6 were measured detected by western blot analysis. Administration of As significantly reduced the cell viability and promoted apoptosis (P<0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of ER-stressed genes BiP, CHOP and caspase-12 mRNA was increased by As administration, while TUDCA treatment led to a lower mRNA expression of these genes, compared with the control group. Results of western blot analysis indicated that the protein expression of IRE1, AFT4 and AFT6 was upregulated in the H-As group, and that the ratio of p-PERK/PERK was also higher than in the other groups. The administration of As demonstrated significant therapeutic effects on the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, as well as the expression of related proteins and genes.

Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses were conducted to measure the expression of PBOV1 in HCC cell lines and tissues. The associations between PBOV1 expression and clinicopathological features were statistically analyzed. The association between PBOV1 expression and the prognosis of HCC patients was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The mRNA and protein expression levels of PBOV1 were significantly increased in the HCC cell lines and HCC tissues (all P<0.05) compared with normal cell lines and tissues. In addition, PBOV1 expression was significantly associated with maximal tumor size (P=0.032), tumor metastasis (P=0.035) and tumor stage (P=0.017).

Furthermore, potential overtreatment of insignificant prostate cancer can be reduced. Besides the diagnostic accuracy of the test, also the context in a specific country determines the potential health benefit and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, the health benefit and cost-effectiveness of SelectMDx were assessed in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.  Subject and methods:   A decision model was used to compare the current standard of care in which men undergo initial prostate biopsy in case of an elevated prostate-specific antigen, to a strategy in which SelectMDx was used to select men for biopsy. Model inputs most relevant to each of the four countries were obtained. With use of the model long-term quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthcare costs were calculated for both strategies.  Results:   In all four countries, the SelectMDx resulted in QALY gain and cost savings compared with the current standard of care. In France, SelectMDx resulted in 0.022 QALYs gained and cost savings of €1217 per patient. For Germany, the model showed a QALY gain of 0.016 and a cost saving of €442. In Italy, the QALY gain and cost savings were 0.031 and €762. In Spain 0.020 QALYs were gained and €250 costs were saved.  Conclusions:   The results of the model showed that with SelectMDx, QALYs could be gained while saving healthcare costs in the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Injectable biosensors may provide a new paradigm for prostate cancer biomarkers by querying the status of the prostate via a noninvasive readout. Proteases are an important class of enzymes that play a role in every hallmark of cancer; their activities could be leveraged as biomarkers. We identified a panel of prostate cancer proteases through transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Using this panel, we developed a nanosensor library that measures protease activity in vitro using fluorescence and in vivo using urinary readouts. In xenograft mouse models, we applied this nanosensor library to classify aggressive prostate cancer and to select predictive substrates. Last, we coformulated a subset of nanosensors with integrin-targeting ligands to increase sensitivity. These targeted nanosensors robustly classified prostate cancer aggressiveness and outperformed PSA.

Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, and tolerance.  Results:   Among a total of 117 patients (median age of 73 years [range, 52-90 years]), 34 (29.1%), 57 (48.7%), and 26 (19.3%) patients had enzalutamide as their 1L (chemo-naive), 2L (post-docetaxel or -abiraterone), and 3L or above treatment options.

In this report we found that three typical phthalates, diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), up-regulated cyclinD1 and PCNA, down-regulated P21, inducing proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that phthalates increased the expression of p-ERK5 and p-p38, along with upregulation of AP-1 (p-c-fos and p-c-jun). In studies with ERK5 and a p38 inhibitor, our data showed that downregulation of p-ERK5 or p38 inhibited phthalate-triggered cell proliferation.

Methods:   We utilized Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data to identify patients aged 66-99 who underwent a prostatectomy, nephrectomy, or cystectomy from 2008 to 2012. We calculated each surgeon's average 90-day episode payment by procedure. Next, we examined payment differences between the most and least expensive quartile providers. For the most expensive quartile of physicians in 2010, we examined their spending quartile in 2011. Finally, we evaluated the correlation in spending over time and across procedures.  Results:   We identified 14,585 patients who underwent surgery by one of 1895 unique clinicians. Differences in payments between the highest and lowest quartiles were $5881, $17,714, and $40,288 for prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and cystectomy, respectively. Only 39%, 16%, and 13% of physicians that were in the highest spending quartile for prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and cystectomy in 2010 were also in the most expensive quartile in 2011. Although we observed weak correlation in year-to-year spending for prostatectomy (0.108, P = .033 to .270, P < .001), annual payments for nephrectomy and cystectomy were not significantly correlated.

Nevertheless, because of possible upgrading, LND is frequently performed with preoperative Gleason 6 prostate cancer. We utilized the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database to evaluate the frequency of LND and preoperative variables for node positivity in contemporary patients with preoperative Gleason 6 disease.  Materials and methods:   SEER-18 registries database was queried for all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between the years 2010 and 2014. Patients were excluded that had unknown histology or unknown preoperative or postoperative Gleason score. We evaluated the rate of LND, Gleason upgrading, and node positive events.  Results:   There were 16,544 patients with preoperative Gleason 6 disease that met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 35.4% (5,856 patients) had LND and 64.6% (10,688 patients) did not. Gleason upgrade on final pathology was found in 51.9% and 45.0% of the LND and no LND cohorts, respectively. There were only 62 (1.1%) patients with node positive disease following LND. These patients had higher preoperative PSA and clinical stage disease.  Conclusion:   In a contemporary cohort of patients with preoperative Gleason 6 prostate cancer LND continues to be performed in about 35% of cases. Despite significant rate of Gleason upgrading on final pathology, only 1% will have node positive disease.

They are frequently resistant to hormonal treatment and may present with paraneoplastic syndromes such as SIADH. The profile of its molecular alterations is under study for the development of target therapies. The association of prostate adenocarcinoma and SIADH is very uncommon and could involve neuroendocrine differentiation.

We show that this is associated with reduced expression of several key DNA repair and replication factors including BRCA2, ATR, CHK1 and RAD51. Consequently, SPOP knockdown impairs RAD51 foci formation and activation of CHK1 in response to replication stress and compromises recovery from replication fork stalling. An SPOP interactome analysis shows that wild type (WT) SPOP but not mutant SPOP associates with multiple proteins involved in transcription, mRNA splicing and export.

The continuous-time weights are conceptually similar to the inverse probability weights that are used in discrete time MSMs. Here, we demonstrate that continuous-time MSMs may be used in practice. First, we briefly describe the causal model assumptions using counting process notation, and we suggest how causal effect estimates can be derived by calculating continuous-time weights. Then, we describe how additive hazard models can be used to find such effect estimates. Finally, we apply this strategy to compare medium to long-term differences between the two prostate cancer treatments radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy, using data from the Norwegian Cancer Registry.

Purpose:   The ENGAGE study was an exercise intervention for prostate cancer survivors, which improved vigorous physical activity (VPA) at postintervention and follow-up. The purpose of this study was to assess (a) whether the intervention improved social cognitive determinants of behavior and (b) the extent to which social cognitive determinants mediated the effect of the exercise intervention on VPA.  Methods:   Overall, 147 men consented to be involved in the study (intervention = 54, usual care = 93). Data from baseline, postintervention (12 weeks) and follow-up (6 months) were used in this analysis. Social cognitive determinants were measured using appropriate measures. VPA was measured using an adapted version of the Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire.  Results:   Compared with the control condition, men in the intervention condition had higher task self-efficacy postintervention (+16.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] +9.19 to +23.31; effect size [d] = 0.85, p < .001) and at follow-up (+12.58; 95% CI = +4.45 to +20.71, d = 0.50, p = .002). Task self-efficacy partially mediated the effect of the exercise intervention on VPA (indirect effect: B = 19.90; 95% CI 1.56 to 38.25, p = .033).  Conclusion:   The intervention improved the belief among prostate cancer survivors that they could perform challenging exercises for longer periods of time, which partially explained the positive effect of the intervention on VPA.

MPC is usually characterized by large multilocular cysts located between the rectum and bladder. The clinical presentation includes obstructive voiding symptoms, such as poor stream, intermittency, sensation of incomplete emptying, acute urinary retention and sometimes constipation symptoms due to mechanical compression of the lower intestine. Most of the previously reported patients with MPC underwent open surgery. Although the natural history of MPC remains unknown, surgical excision may not always be necessary. Here we report the case of a 49-year-old male, treated by transurethral electroresection of prostate (TURP) for prostate cyst one and half years before．His biopsy of TURP showed benign prostatic tissue with no evidence of malignancy. However, the symptoms of urinary tract obstruction were obviously aggravated after the operation. Acute urinary retention occurred intermittently 3 times. In our hospital, his total prostate specific antigen (tPSA) was 5.440 μg/L, free prostate specific antigen (fPSA) was 1.528 μg/L. After examination, it was considered as benign lesions clearly. In the operation of TURP, we found that the tumor was multilocular cystic. Histologically, the cell was mucus. Concerning the immunophenotype, CK5/6(+) , p40(+), PSA(+), P504S(+), PAX-2(-), PAX-8(-), MUC1(+), MUC5ac(+), the results of special staining were as follows: AB(+), PAS(+).

Methods:   88 patients with pathologic confirmed prostate carcinoma who were underwent LRP were included in this study. MRI examination was performed in 1 week before the biopsy. The patients were divided into two groups according to PV (<50 mL, ≥50 mL) on preoperative MRI. The patients were divided into two groups according to IPPL (<5 mm, ≥5 mm), IPPL was measured on MRI as the vertical distance from the tip of the protruding prostate to the base of the urinary bladder. After surgery we recorded and analyzed recovery of urinary continence of the patients for one year.  Results:   All the 88 patients received extra-peritoneal LRP successfully. The average operation time was (155±67) min, and the estimated blood volume was (145±159) mL. There was a significant difference between group PV<50 mL and ≥50 mL in the operation time (P=0.045). All the patients who underwent MRI preoperatively showed that their mean PV was (44.54±26.58) mL and mean IPPL was (5.2±5.7) mm. The continence rate for all the patients after LRP was 53.4%, 84.1% and 94.3% in their follow-up of 3, 6 and 12 months. Three months after LRP, the continence rate for group PV<50 mL and ≥50 mL were 61.5% and 30.4%, which were completely continent (P=0.010). Six or twelve months after surgery, the continence rate was 87.7% and 73.9% (P=0.120), 96.9% and 87.0% (P=0.076) for group PV<50 mL and ≥50 mL separately. Three months after LRP, the continence rate for group IPPL<5 mm and ≥5 mm were 66.1% and 31.3%, which were completely continent (P=0.002).

Methods and materials:   One hundred twenty three men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer were treated with primary EBRT and/or brachytherapy and had evaluable pre-treatment mpMRI with endorectal coil. Images were assessed for the presence of radiographic extraprostatic extension (rEPE), seminal vesicle invasion (rSVI), lymph node involvement (LNI), sextant involvement, and largest axial tumor diameter. Imaging characteristics were analyzed along with clinical risk factors against freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF). Median follow-up time was 50 months.  Results:   Fourteen (11%) men developed biochemical failure.

The recent use of multikinase inhibitors has also met limited success. An alternative approach relies on drugs that induce cell differentiation, as the ensuing increased expression of the cotransporter for sodium and iodine (NIS) may partially restore sensitivity to radioiodine. The inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway has shown some efficacy in this context. Aggressive thyroid tumors overexpress the isoform-A of the insulin receptor (IR-A) and its ligand IGF-2; this IGF-2/IR-A loop is associated with de-differentiation and stem-like phenotype, resembling RAI-refractory tumors. Importantly, IR-A has been shown to be positively modulated by the non-integrin collagen receptor DDR1 in human breast cancer. Using undifferentiated human thyroid cancer cells, we now evaluated the effects of DDR1 on IGF-2/IR-A loop and on markers of cell differentiation and stemness. DDR1 silencing or downregulation caused significant reduction of IR-A and IGF-2 expression, and concomitant increased levels of differentiation markers (NIS, Tg, TSH, TPO). Conversely, markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Vimentin, Snail-2, Zeb1, Zeb2 and N-Cadherin) and stemness (OCT-4, SOX-2, ABCG2 and Nanog) decreased. These effects were collagen independent. In contrast, overexpression of either DDR1 or its kinase-inactive variant K618A DDR1-induced changes suggestive of less differentiated and stem-like phenotype. Collagen stimulation was uneffective. In conclusion, in poorly differentiated thyroid cancer, DDR1 silencing or downregulation blocks the IGF-2/IR-A autocrine loop and induces cellular differentiation.

Methods and materials:   After undergoing RP with or without pelvic lymph node dissection, 112 patients were enrolled. Hypofractionated adjuvant RT (2.25 Gy daily for 29 fractions; total 65.25 Gy) was administered to 40 patients with high-risk features. Hypofractionated salvage RT (2.25 Gy daily for 32 or 33 fractions; total 72-74.25 Gy) was prescribed for 72 patients (24 with biochemical relapse, 48 with local relapse).

Results:   Acute GU toxicity occurred in 41 of 112 patients (36%) (G1 31, G2 10). Acute GI toxicity was observed in 55 (49%) patients (G1 44, G2 11). Uroflowmetry showed that only salvage RT reduced maximum flow significantly (maximum, 68 vs 50 mL/s; P = .003), perhaps because a higher RT dose had been administered.

The present study aims to further optimize them as anti-prostate cancer agents with both good potency and bioavailability. (1E,4E)-1,5-Bis(1H-imidazol-2-yl)penta-1,4-diene-3-one, the potential metabolic product of (1E,4E)-1,5-bis(1-alkyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)penta-1,4-diene-3-ones, was synthesized and evaluated for its anti-proliferative activity. The promising potency of 1,5-bis(1-alkyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)penta-1,4-diene-3-ones was completely abolished by removing the 1-alkyl group, suggesting the critical role of an appropriate group on the N1 position. We then envisioned that N-aryl substitution to exclude the C-H bond on the carbon adjacent to the N1 position (α-H) may increase the metabolic stability. Consequently, seven (1E,4E)-1,5-bis(1-aryl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)penta-1,4-dien-3-ones and three (1E,4E)-1,5-bis(1-aryl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)penta-1,4-dien-3-ones, as well as three (1E,4E)-1,5-bis(1-aryl-1H-pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyridine-2-yl)penta-1,4-dien-3-ones, were synthesized through a three-step transformation, including N-arylation via Ullmann condensation, formylation, and Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction.

The segmentation accuracy could largely affect the efficacy of radiation treatment. However, due to the touching boundaries with the bladder and the rectum, the prostate boundary is often ambiguous and hard to recognize, which leads to inconsistent manual delineations across different clinicians. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach for boundary detection and deformable segmentation of the prostate. Our proposed method aims to learn a boundary distance transform, which maps an intensity image into a boundary distance map. To enforce the spatial consistency on the learned distance transform, we combine our approach with the auto-context model for iteratively refining the estimated distance map. After the refinement, the prostate boundaries can be readily detected by finding the valley in the distance map. In addition, the estimated distance map can also be used as a new external force for guiding the deformable segmentation. Specifically, to automatically segment the prostate, we integrate the estimated boundary distance map into a level set formulation. Experimental results on 73 CT planning images show that the proposed distance transform is more effective than the traditional classification-based method for driving the deformable segmentation. Also, our method can achieve more consistent segmentations than human raters, and more accurate results than the existing methods under comparison.""","""['Yaozong Gao', 'Li Wang', 'Yeqin Shao', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2014""","""None""","""Mach Learn Med Imaging""","""['Locally-constrained boundary regression for segmentation of prostate and rectum in the planning CT images.', 'Accurate Segmentation of CT Male Pelvic Organs via Regression-Based Deformable Models and Multi-Task Random Forests.', 'Auto-segmentation of normal and target structures in head and neck CT images: a feature-driven model-based approach.', 'Robust brain ROI segmentation by deformation regression and deformable shape model.', 'Prostate segmentation by sparse representation based classification.', 'Iterative Label Denoising Network: Segmenting Male Pelvic Organs in CT From 3D Bounding Box Annotations.', 'Segmentation of the proximal femur in radial MR scans using a random forest classifier and deformable model registration.', 'A combined learning algorithm for prostate segmentation on 3D CT images.', 'Combining Population and Patient-Specific Characteristics for Prostate Segmentation on 3D CT Images.', 'Multiatlas-Based Segmentation Editing With Interaction-Guided Patch Selection and Label Fusion.']"""

AR plays an important role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the role of AR in PCa metastasis is not fully understood. To investigate the role of AR in PCa metastasis, we examined AR expression level in primary and metastatic PCa by analyzing gene array data of 378 primary prostate tumors and 120 metastatic prostate tumors from Oncomine, as well as carrying out immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of 56 prostate cancer samples. Expression of mRNA and protein of AR as well as its target gene prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was much higher in metastatic prostate tumors than in primary prostate tumors. Knockdown of AR with siRNA or treating with anti-androgen Casodex reduced migration and invasion ability of C4-2B PCa cells. Knockdown of AR increased protein expression of E-cadherin and AR coregulator KAT5 but reduced expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker proteins Slug, Snail, MMP-2, vimentin, and β-catenin. Knockdown of KAT5 increased migration of C4-2B cells, whereas overexpression of KAT5 suppressed cell migration. KAT5 knockdown rescues the suppressive effect of AR knockdown on migration of C4-2B cells. Gene expression level of AR and KAT5 showed a negative correlation. PCa patients with higher AR expression or lower KAT5 expression correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival.

Main methods:   CD44+/CD133+ and CD44+ stem cells were isolated from PC3 and LNCaP cells, respectively by magnetic-activated cell sorting system. 3D cell culture was used to evaluate the ability of quercetin, MK siRNA, and the combination of both to inhibit spheroid formation, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Image-based cytometer, RT-qPCR, Western blotting and transwell migration assays were performed.  Key findings:   Quercetin treatment for 24-72 h inhibited PC3 and CD44+/CD133+ stem cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of endogenous MK expression significantly suppressed proliferation of CD44+/CD133+ and CD44+ cells as well as their parent cells. Co-administration of MK siRNA and quercetin reduced the cell survival, induced apoptosis and caused G1 phase cell cycle arrest more effectively than the individual therapy. Knockdown of MK significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of quercetin on CD44+/CD133+ migration and spheroid formation. In addition, the combined therapy inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT and ERK1/2, and reduced the protein expression of p38, ABCG2 and NF-κB.  Significance:   Quercetin alone exhibited significant cytotoxic effects on CD44+/CD133+.

Methods and materials:   Daily or weekly CBCT images of 20 patients (10 head and neck, 5 lung, and 5 prostate cancers) who underwent resimulation per physicians' clinical decisions, mainly from the comparison of CBCT scans, were used to determine action levels. The first CBCT image acquired before the first treatment was used as the reference image to rule out effects of dose inaccuracy from the CBCT. The Pearson correlation of clinical target volume (CTV) was used as a parameter of anatomic variation. Parameters for action levels on dose and anatomic variation were deduced by comparing the parameters and clinical decisions made for replanning. A software tool was developed to automatically perform all procedures, including dose calculations, using the CBCT and plan evaluations.  Results:   Replans were clinically decided based on either significant dose or anatomic changes in 13 cases. The 7 cases that did not require replanning showed dose differences <5%, and the Pearson correlation of the CTV was >75% for all fractions. A difference in planning target volume dose >5% or a difference in the image correlation coefficient of the CTV <0.75 proved to be indicators for replanning. Once the results of the CBCT plan met the replanning criteria, the software tool automatically alerted the attending physician and physicist by both e-mail and pager so that the case could be examined closely.

The contribution of Δ4A to the clinical antitumor activity of ABI remains unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between plasma Δ4A concentration and survival in 36 mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone acetate (1000 mg/day) plus prednisone (10 mg/day). Plasma trough ABI and Δ4A concentrations were monthly assayed using liquid chromatography during the first 3 months of treatment. ABI and Δ4A Cmin were defined as the mean of trough concentrations measured for each patient. Predictive factors regarding progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were explored using univariate Cox model. Mean plasma ABI and Δ4A Cmin were 12.6 ± 6.8 ng/mL and 1.6 ± 1.3 ng/mL, respectively. The mean metabolic ratio Δ4A/ABI was of 0.18 ± 0.25. In regard with in vitro pharmacodynamic data, effective plasma concentrations for ABI and Δ4A were reached in 30 patients (83.3%) and only 2 patients (5.6%), respectively. Higher Δ4A Cmin was associated with shorter OS (Hazard ratio, HR 1.54; CI95% 1.06-2.22; p = 0.022) but not with PFS. The HR associated with the metabolic Δ4A/ABI ratio for PFS and OS were 7.80 (CI 95% 1.63-37.38; p = 0.010) and 12.52 (CI 95% 1.95-80.47, p = 0.0078), respectively. The present study shows Δ4A is unlikely to have meaningful contribution to pharmacodynamic activity of ABI in mCPRC, rather that higher plasma Δ4A concentration is associated with worse clinical outcomes.

Methods:   Three hundred seventy seven patients with and without CR were retrospectively selected by stratified cohort sampling design from RP database. PTEN status (by immunohistochemistry [IHC] and fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]) and GPS results were determined for RP specimens. BCR was defined as Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) ≥ 0.2 ng/mL or initiation of salvage therapy for a rising PSA. CR was defined as local recurrence and/or distant metastases.  Results:   Baseline mean age, PSA, and GPS score for the cohort were 61.1 years, 8 ng/dL, and 32.8. PTEN loss was noted in 38% patients by FISH and 25% by IHC. The concordance between FISH and IHC for PTEN loss was 66% (Kappa coefficient 0.278; P < .001). On univariable analysis, loss of PTEN by FISH or IHC was associated with BCR and CR (P < .05). However, after adjusting for GPS results, PTEN loss was not a significant predictor for CR or BCR (P > .1). The GPS result remained strongly associated with CR and BCR after adjusting for PTEN status (P < .001). PTEN status and GPS results only weakly correlated. GPS was widely distributed regardless of PTEN status indicating the biological heterogeneity of PCa even in PTEN-deficient cases.

We used data from the Nordic Occupational Cancer study from Finland and Sweden. Five population controls were selected for each prostate cancer patient, matched on age and country. We had 239,835 cases and 1,199,175 controls in our study. For each case and control we estimated cumulative PPWL based on probability, level and duration of PPWL using the NOCCA Job Exposure Matrix. We then stratified individuals as having no exposure (reference category), low physical activity (below 50th percentile of the exposed), moderate exposure (50th-90th percentile) and high exposure (90th percentile and higher).

In our previous study, downregulation of miR-1266 and miR-185 was demonstrated in PCa tissues and cell lines. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether miR-1266 and miR-185 are involved in the regulation of B-cell lymphoma (BCL) 2 and BCL2L1, respectively, and whether transfection of PCa cell lines with miR-1266 and miR-185 mimics can alter tumorigenic phenotypes. Methods: In order to investigate the regulation of BCL2 and BCL2L1 mRNA levels by miR-1266 and miR-185, respectively, a luciferase reporter assay was used. Real-time PCR was also used to analyze changes in the levels of BCL2 and BCL2L1 mRNAs in PCa cell lines following transfection with synthetic miR-1266 and miR-185. Cell apoptosis was determined by Annexin V protein expression analysis via flow cytometry. In addition to the MTT assay, a cell proliferation assay was performed. Result: A luciferase assay confirmed that the BCL2 and BCL2L1 genes may be targeted by miR-1266 and miR-185, respectively, through binding to their 3′UTR regions. Transfection of PC3 and DU145 cells with miR-1266 and miR-185 induced apoptosis and reduced proliferation, which also revealed an inverse correlation with BCL2 and BCL2L1 gene expression in the treated cells.

We investigated whether inherited variation in these six genes was associated with overall survival (OS) in men with CRPC.  Methods:   The test cohort comprised 600 patients diagnosed with CRPC between 1996 and 2011 at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Genotyping of 66 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the six genes was performed on blood derived DNAs. For the top four SNPs (P < 0.05), validation was conducted in an independent cohort of 223 men diagnosed with CRPC between 2000 and 2014. Multivariable Cox regression adjusting for known prognostic factors estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the association of genetic variants with OS.  Results:   Two thirds of patients in both cohorts had metastases at CRPC diagnosis. Median OS from CRPC diagnosis was 3.6 (95%CI 3.3-4.0) years in the test cohort and 4.6 (95%CI 3.8-5.2) years in the validation cohort. Fifty-nine SNPs in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were analyzed. The major alleles of rs1318056 and rs1490311 in ABL2, and the minor alleles of rs2073917 and rs3764322 in ITGAL were associated with increased risk of death in the test cohort (adjusted-HRs 1.27-1.39; adjusted-p <0.05; false discovery rate <0.35). In the validation cohort, a similar association with OS was observed for rs1318056 in ABL2 (adjusted-HR 1.44; 95%CI 0.89-2.34) and rs2073917 in ITGAL (adjusted-HR 1.41; 95%CI 0.82-2.42). The associations did not reach statistical significance most likely due to the small sample size of the validation cohort (adjusted-p = 0.142 and 0.209, respectively). Additional eQTL analysis indicated that minor alleles of rs1318056 and rs1490311 in ABL2 are associated with a lower ABL2 expression in blood.  Conclusions:   These findings corroborate our initial work on the RNA expression of genes involved in immunity and inflammation from blood and clinical outcome and suggest that germline polymorphisms in ABL2 and ITGAL may be associated with the risk of death in men with CRPC. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore their functional mechanisms.""","""['Wanling Xie', 'Konrad H Stopsack', 'Sarah J Drouin', 'Henry Fu', 'Mark M Pomerantz', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Gwo-Shu M Lee', 'Philip W Kantoff']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Germline genetic variation in JAK2 as a prognostic marker in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A 2-Gene Panel Derived From Prostate Cancer-Enhanced Transcripts in Whole Blood Is Prognostic for Survival and Predicts Treatment Benefit in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A whole-blood RNA transcript-based prognostic model in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer: a prospective study.', 'Prognostic role of chromogranin A in castration-resistant prostate cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'The role of microRNA in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Systemic immune microenvironment and regulatory network analysis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification of four genes associated with cutaneous metastatic melanoma.', 'Identification of CD38 as a potential biomarker in skin cutaneous melanoma using bioinformatics analysis.']"""

New drugs as abiraterone or enzalutamide, affecting androgen receptor pathway at different levels, inhibit the proliferative advantage of prostate cancer cells with important long term benefits. Despite the advantages of this second-generation androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), resistance mechanisms, primitive or acquired, often develop. The existence of androgen receptor (AR) splice variants (AR-Vs), in particular AR-V7 expression detected in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), represents an example of acquired resistance, as evidenced in preclinical and clinical studies. Recent studies also have suggested the role of AR-V7 as a prognostic biomarker in mCRPC. In this field, hot topics are the methodology used to isolate CTC and the assay for AR-V7 measurement. Our study aims to develop a standardized operating procedure (SOP) to evaluate AR-V7 in CRPC.  Method:   The application of a realized cell based Reference Sample as Standardized Quality Control tool for CTC-AR-V7 assay has been shown. Then the development, the performance evaluation and contextualization in a clinical setting of this standardized operating procedure (SOP) have been reported to evaluate the prognostic biomarker AR-V7 in metastatic prostate cancer.  Results and conclusions:   The standardized procedure has high sensitivity and specificity and enables the detection and quantification of the spliced variant with respect to the full length AR (AR-FL) mRNA in CTC DNA purified from the blood of patients with CRPC. This procedure has been further validated in a consecutive series of patients with mCRPC, confirming its role as prognostic biomarker.""","""['Stefania Tommasi', 'Brunella Pilato', 'Claudia Carella', 'Antonia Lasorella', 'Katia Danza', 'Ivan Vallini', 'Simona De Summa', 'Emanuele Naglieri']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Associations between AR-V7 status in circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour cell count and survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'CTC-derived AR-V7 detection as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in advanced prostate cancer.', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A Systematic Review of Circulating Tumor Cells Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Prognostic and Predictive Value of Liquid Biopsy-Derived Androgen Receptor Variant 7 (AR-V7) in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'GLUT3/SLC2A3 Is an Endogenous Marker of Hypoxia in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines and Patient-Derived Xenograft Tumors.', 'Urinary exosome-based androgen receptor-variant 7 detection in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'The Prognostic Value of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated With Novel Hormonal Therapy or Chemotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

The quality of reporting for such studies in the urologic literature is unknown.  Methods:   In accordance with an a priori protocol, we systematically searched for all articles on diagnostic accuracy studies published in four major urologic journals in 2015. Using the 2015 STAndards for Reporting Diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) checklist, two of us independently abstracted data. For each article, we calculated STARD summary scores (scale of 0-30, with higher scores reflecting higher-quality reporting). We compared scores by journal, topic, and sample size.  Results:   We screened 819 references of which 61 met inclusion criteria. Nearly two-thirds of studies (39/61%; 63.9%) addressed prostate cancer diagnosis or staging; less than one in ten (6/61%; 9.8%) was conducted in non-oncological disease settings. The major focus for the investigation of new index tests lay in imaging modalities (33/61%; 54.1%); over half of these imaging studies addressed magnetic resonance imaging (18/61%; 29.5%). The average STARD score was 18.9 ± 2.4 (range 12-24). Six criteria had poor reporting compliance and were met by less than 20% of studies. We found no association between reporting quality and topic, journal or study size.  Conclusions:   The reporting quality of studies of diagnostic accuracy appears modest and independent of topic, journal or study size.

Methods:   T2-weighted (T2) and fat-saturated (T2FS) MRIs were acquired on 3T GE (GE, Waukesha, WI, USA) and Siemens (Erlangen, Germany) systems. Manual prostate and PZ contours were used to create atlas libraries. As a test MRI is entered, the procedure for atlas segmentation automatically identifies the atlas subjects that best match the test subject, followed by a normalized intensity-based free-form deformable registration. The contours are transformed to the test subject, and Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) and Hausdorff distances between atlas-generated and manual contours were used to assess performance.  Results:   Three atlases were generated based on GE_T2 (n = 30), GE_T2FS (n = 30), and Siem_T2FS (n = 31). When test images matched the contrast and vendor of the atlas, DSCs of 0.81 and 0.83 for T2 ± FS were obtained (baseline performance). Atlases performed with higher accuracy when segmenting (i) T2FS vs. T2 images, likely due to a superior contrast between prostate vs. surrounding tissue; (ii) prostate vs. zonal anatomy; (iii) in the mid-gland vs. base and apex. Atlases performance declined when tested with images with differing contrast and MRI vendor. Conversely, combined atlases showed similar performance to baseline.  Conclusion:   The MRI atlas-based segmentation method achieved good results for prostate, PZ, and TZ compared to expert contoured volumes. Combined atlases performed similarly to matching atlas and scan type. The technique is fast, fully automatic, and implemented on commercially available clinical platform.""","""['Kyle R Padgett', 'Amy Swallen', 'Sara Pirozzi', 'Jon Piper', 'Felix M Chinea', 'Matthew C Abramowitz', 'Aaron Nelson', 'Alan Pollack', 'Radka Stoyanova']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Segmentation of prostate and prostate zones using deep learning : A\xa0multi-MRI vendor analysis.', 'Multi-atlas segmentation of the whole hippocampus and subfields using multiple automatically generated templates.', 'A multi-atlas based method for automated anatomical Macaca fascicularis brain MRI segmentation and PET kinetic extraction.', 'Whole Brain Magnetic Resonance Image Atlases: A Systematic Review of Existing Atlases and Caveats for Use in Population Imaging.', 'More than a decade of developmental gene expression atlases: where are we now?', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on MRI: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Deep Learning for Per-Fraction Automatic Segmentation of Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) and Organs at Risk (OARs) in Adaptive Radiotherapy of Cervical Cancer.', 'Challenge of prostate MRI segmentation on T2-weighted images: inter-observer variability and impact of prostate morphology.', 'Diagnostic efficiency of hybrid imaging using PSMA ligands, PET/CT, PET/MRI and MRI in identifying malignant prostate lesions.', 'The role of radiomics in prostate cancer radiotherapy.']"""

As for prostates, a rat probasin promoter has been widely used to drive prostate-specific gene expression. To optimize its codon usage to that of mammals, we used codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre) for prostate-specific Cre-loxP recombination.  Materials and methods:   We generated transgenic mice that express iCre driven by conventional probasin promoter in a prostate-specific manner (PB-iCre). Linearized PB-iCre transgene deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) were microinjected into pronuclei of fertilized mouse embryos. The integration of the transgene was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. A line of transgenic mice expressing a sufficient amount of iCre mRNA in its prostate was selected. To test recombinase activity of PB-iCre in vivo, its offspring was crossbred with Ptenflox/flox mice in which murine prostate adenocarcinoma is reported to occur upon excision of loxP-flanked regions.  Results:   Eight founder animals were obtained, all of which showed germ line integration of PB-iCre transgene by Southern blot analysis. Among them, the prostate from only one line (line 58) expressed a sufficient amount of iCre mRNA. This line was crossbred with Ptenflox/flox mice to generate PB-iCre58/Ptenflox/flox. As a result, 12-week-old PB-iCre58/Ptenflox/flox mice presented with prostate adenocarcinoma that was histologically similar to human cribriform prostate cancer of Gleason grade 4.

We hypothesized that the concurrent identification of the DNA copy number alterations 10q23.3 (PTEN) deletion and 16p13.3 (PDPK1) gain, related to the PI3K/AKT survival pathway, would improve prognostication. We assessed PTEN deletion status using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and evaluated its clinical significance in combination with the 16p13.3 gain in a set of 332 primary radical prostatectomy cases on a tissue microarray with clinical follow-up. The PTEN deletion was detected in 34% (97/287) of the evaluable tumors and was significantly associated with high Gleason grade group (P < 0.0001) and advanced pathological tumor stage (pT-stage, P < 0.001). The PTEN deletion emerged as a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence independent of the standard clinicopathologic parameters (hazard ratio: 3.00, 95% confidence interval: 1.81-4.98; P < 0.0001) and further stratified patients with low and intermediate risk of biochemical recurrence [Gleason grade group 1-2 (≤3 + 4), Gleason grade group 2 (3 + 4), pT2, prostate-specific antigen ≤ 10, low and intermediate CAPRA-S score; log-rank P ≤ 0.007]. A PTEN deletion also increased the risk of distant metastasis (log-rank, P = 0.001), further supporting its role in prostate cancer progression. Combining both 16p13.3 gain and PTEN deletion improved biochemical recurrence risk stratification and provided prognostic information beyond the established CAPRA-S score (co-alteration: hazard ratio: 4.70, 95% confidence interval: 2.12-10.42; P < 0.0001).

However, its role and its related mechanisms in prostate tumorigenesis remain unknown. To elucidate the role of TFF3 overexpression in PCa, we silenced TFF3 in two PCa cell lines that overexpressed TFF3 and explored the molecular mechanism behind its antiapoptotic role. We also examined TFF3 expression in 108 Korean PCa specimens and 106 normal prostate tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. The mean TFF3 IHC score in the tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in the normal tissues (4.702 vs. 0.311, P = 2.52 × 10-24). TFF3-silenced cells showed suppressed tumor cell growth and migration. TFF3 silencing decreased BCL2 and increased BAX expression. The translocation of BAX to the mitochondria was also confirmed. After TFF3 silencing, the expression of the mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins, cytochrome C and Smac/DIABLO, was elevated, and these proteins were released from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Downstream mediators of mitochondrial apoptosis, including cleaved caspase-3, caspase-9, and PARP, were also elevated. Accordingly, the proportion of apoptotic cells was significantly higher among TFF3-silenced cells. There was no difference in extrinsic apoptosis-related molecules after TFF3 silencing. All the results support that TFF3 silencing induces the downstream signaling pathway of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.

Experimental design:   We investigated 122 patients with PSMA-PET/MRI prior to planned radical prostatectomy (RP). Primary endpoint was the accuracy of PSMA-PET/MRI in tumor staging as compared with staging-relevant histology. In addition, a multidisciplinary team reassessed the initial therapeutic approach to evaluate its impact on the therapeutic management.  Results:   PSMA-PET/MRI correctly identified prostate cancer in 119 of 122 patients (97.5%). Eighty-one patients were treated with RP and pelvic lymphadenectomy.

Moreover, there is a lack of research investigating early-life alcohol intake as a risk factor for either overall or high-grade prostate cancer. We examined lifetime alcohol intake in association with prostate cancer diagnosis in an equal-access, racially diverse prostate biopsy cohort. Men undergoing prostate biopsy at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center from 2007 to 2018 completed a survey indicating average number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week [categorized as none (ref), 1-6, ≥7] during each decade of life. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test the association between alcohol intake across decades and diagnosis of overall, low-grade [grade group (GG) 1-2] and high-grade prostate cancer (GG 3-5). Of 650 men ages 49-89 who underwent biopsy, 325 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 238 with low-grade and 88 with high-grade disease. Relative to nondrinkers, men who consumed ≥7 drinks/week at ages 15 to 19 had increased odds of high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis (OR = 3.21, P trend = 0.020), with similar findings for ages 20 to 29, 30 to 39, and 40 to 49. Consistent with these results, men in the upper tertile of cumulative lifetime intake had increased odds of high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis (OR = 3.20, P trend = 0.003). In contrast, current alcohol intake was not associated with prostate cancer. In conclusion, among men undergoing prostate biopsy, heavier alcohol intake earlier in life and higher cumulative lifetime intake were positively associated with high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis, while current intake was unrelated to prostate cancer. Our findings suggest that earlier-life alcohol intake should be explored as a potential risk factor for high-grade prostate cancer.

The data has shown that AKR1C3 expression is significantly elevated in clinical metastatic PCa specimens, indicating a potential role of AKR1C3 in PCa metastasis.  Methods:   C4-2, 22RV1-T, and PC-3 cells with higher AKR1C3 expression were selected and treated with several specific AKR1C3 shRNAs or small molecule inhibitor, and the cell migration and invasion abilities were detected by wound healing assay and Transwell assay. The expression of several epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (i.e., E-cadherin and vimentin) and the related transcription factors (i.e., ZEB1, TWIST1, and SLUG) was examined by Western blot or quantitative PCR assays, and the phosphorylation of AKT or ERK was detected by Western blot. Also, subcutaneous xenografts with 22RV1-T sublines were used to detect in vivo tumor growth, and the expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, and ZEB1 by immunohistochemical staining. The correlation between AKR1C3 and EMT marker expression in clinical specimens was analyzed.  Results:   AKR1C3 was overexpressed in more aggressive PCa cell lines regardless of the androgen receptor status. Knockdown of AKR1C3 expression or inhibition of AKR1C3 activity could significantly suppress cell migration and invasion abilities in vitro, and increase E-cadherin expression but decrease vimentin expression, in which the phosphorylation of ERK and the EMT-associated transcription factor expression were specifically down-regulated. Also, knockdown of AKR1C3 could suppress PCa tumorigenesis and reverse EMT in vivo.

Their ability to catch the main critical delivery errors was studied.  Methods:   Measurements were performed with a linac accelerator equipped with EPID aSi1000, Portal Dose Image Prediction (PDIP), and PerFRACTION softwares. Their performances were studied simulating perturbations of a reference plan through systematic variations in dose values and micromultileaf collimator position. The performance of PDIP, based on 2D forward method, was evaluated calculating gamma passing rate (%GP) between no-error and error-simulated measurements. The impact of errors with PerFRACTION, based on 3D projection technique, was analyzed by calculating the difference between reference and perturbed DVH (%ΔD). Subsequently pre-treatment verification with PerFRACTION was done for 27 patients of different pathologies.  Results:   The sensitivity of PerFRACTION was slightly higher than sensitivity of PDIP, reaching a maximum of 0.9. Specificity was 1 for PerFRACTION and 0.6 for PDIP. The analysis of patients' DVHs indicated that the mean %ΔD was (1.2 ± 1.9)% for D2%, (0.6 ± 1.7)% for D95% and (-0.0 ± 1.2)% for Dmean of PTV. Regarding OARs, we observed important discrepancies on DVH but that the higher dose variations were in low dose area (<10 Gy).

Because patient symptoms and function can differ by age of the survivor, the aim of our study was to examine patient-reported quality of life and prostate symptoms by age at diagnosis among a registry of Dutch prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   A population of 617 individuals from the Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long-Term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) database was surveyed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and prostate symptom (EORTC QLQ-PR25) scales. Age at diagnosis was the main independent variable, with three age categories: 60 years and younger, 61-70 years, and 71 years and older. Dependent variables were the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-PR25 scales, divided into positive and negative outcomes. Positive measures of health-related quality of life included global health, physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning. Negative outcomes included fatigue, nausea, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, and diarrhea. We also assessed sexual activity, and urinary, bowel and hormonal symptoms. Descriptive analyses included frequencies with chi-square tests and medians with Kruskal-Wallis tests. Multivariable adjusted analyses were conducted by median regression modeling.  Results:   Among the numerous scales showing some unadjusted association with age group, only two scales demonstrated significant differences between prostate cancer patients age 71+ compared to the youngest group (age < 61) after multivariable adjustment. On average, the oldest patients experienced an 8.3-point lower median physical functioning score (β = - 8.3; 95% CI = - 13.9, - 2.8; p = 0.003) and a 16.7-point lower median sexual activity score (β = - 16.7; 95% CI = - 24.7, - 8.6; p < 0.001) while controlling for BMI, marital status, time since diagnosis, comorbidities (heart condition), Gleason score, and treatment (prostatectomy).  Conclusions:   Results suggest that patient age at diagnosis should be considered among factors that contribute to health-related quality of life outcomes for prostate cancer survivors.  Implications for cancer survivors:   A possible reevaluation of screening recommendations may be appropriate to acknowledge age as a factor contributing to health-related quality of life outcomes for prostate cancer survivors.""","""['Christine J Kurian', 'Amy E Leader', 'Melissa S Y Thong', 'Scott W Keith', 'Charnita M Zeigler-Johnson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""BMC Public Health""","""['Adherence to the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research recommendations for cancer prevention is associated with better health-related quality of life among long-term colorectal cancer survivors: results of the PROFILES registry.', 'Age-specific health-related quality of life in disease-free long-term prostate cancer survivors versus male population controls-results from a population-based study.', 'Health-related quality of life in long-term survivors with localised prostate cancer by therapy-Results from a population-based study.', 'Quality of life after low-dose rate-brachytherapy for prostate carcinoma - long-term results and literature review on QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 results in published brachytherapy series.', 'Health-related quality of life among long-term (≥5\xa0years) prostate cancer survivors by primary intervention: a systematic review.', 'Geriatric assessment in the older adult with genitourinary cancer: A narrative review.', 'The profile of Black South African men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the Free State, South Africa.', 'Patient-Factors Influencing the 2-Year Trajectory of Mental and Physical Health in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Depression, Anxiety, and Their Association to Health-Related Quality of Life in Men Commencing Prostate Cancer Treatment at Tertiary Hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa.', 'Molecular Expression of Some Oncogenes and Predisposing Behaviors Contributing to the Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer.']"""

In this study we assessed germline AR polymorphisms and mutations in PCa patients with prediction of pathogenicity of the identified mutations by in silico analysis. Methods: Diagnosis of PCa was based on histopathology of prostate tissue (Gleason Score criteria) and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 38 patients. All exons and exon-intron boundaries of AR were amplified using polymerase chain reactions (PCR) followed by Sanger sequencing. In silico analysis was performed using Polyphen-2 and Mutation Taster®. Results: Two polymorphisms, CAG repeat sequence (13-34 repeats in length) and p.Pro214Glu (MAF: 0.0789) located in exon 1 were identified. A missense mutation (c.47C>A/p.Pro146Glu) and in-frame deletion of a CAG sequence leading to loss of Arginine at codon 85 (c.252_254delCAG/p.Arg85-) were identified in a 70 year old patient with a Gleason Score and PSA level of 2 and 2.4ng/dL, respectively. His PSA level decreased to < 0.5 ng/dL after 9 months of androgen deprivation therapy. Identified mutations were predicted to be non-disease causing by Polyphen-2 and Mutation Taster®. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that the frequency of germline mutations of AR was low in PCa patients in Indonesia (5.26%: 2/38 alleles), so that they are not likely to be major etiological factors.

Subjects and Methods: Data from 172 countries were extracted for analysis. Associations between country specific per capita total meat intake and PC61 incidence at country level were examined using Pearson’s r and Spearman rho, partial correlation, stepwise multiple linear regression analyses with ageing, GDP, Is (index of magnitude of prostate cancer gene accumulation at population level), obesity prevalence and urbanization included as the confounding factors. Countries were also grouped for regional association analysis. The data were log-transformed for analysis in SPSS.

Results: Worldwide, total meat intake was strongly and positively associated with PC61 incidence in Pearson’s r (r= 0.595, p<0.001) and Spearman rho (r= 0.637, p<0.001) analyses. This relationship remained significant in partial correlation (r= 0.295, p<0.001) when ageing, GDP, Is, obesity prevalence and urbanization were kept statistically constant. GDP was weakly and insignificantly associated with PC61 when total meat intake was kept statistically constant. Stepwise multiple linear regression identified that total meat was a significant predictor of PC61 with total meat intake and all the five confounders included as the independent variables (R2=0.417). Post hoc Scheffe tests revealed nine significant mean differences of PC61 between the six WHO regions, but all disappeared when the contributing effect of total meat on PC61 incidence rate was removed. GDP was not identified as the statistically significant predictor of PC61 in either of the models including or excluding total meat as the independent variable.

An increasing number of studies have suggested that mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and TFs could play important roles in various biological processes that are associated with cancer pathogenesis. This study aims to reveal functional genes and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of PCa with bioinformatics.  Methods:   Original gene expression profiles were obtained from the GSE64318 and GSE46602 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We conducted differential screens of the expression of genes (DEGs) between two groups using the online tool GEO2R based on the R software limma package. Interactions between differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted and merged with the target genes. Co-expression of miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs was selected to construct mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA interaction networks. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and transcription factors were annotated. Expression of hub genes in the TCGA datasets was verified to improve the reliability of our analysis.  Results:   The results demonstrate that 60 miRNAs, 1578 mRNAs and 61 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in PCa. The mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA networks were composed of 5 miRNA nodes, 13 lncRNA nodes, and 45 mRNA nodes. The DEGs were mainly enriched in the nuclei and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of transcription, related to sequence-specific DNA binding, and participated in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. These pathways are related to cancer and focal adhesion signalling pathways. Furthermore, we found that 5 miRNAs, 6 lncRNAs, 6 mRNAs and 2 TFs play important regulatory roles in the interaction network. The expression levels of EGFR, VEGFA, PIK3R1, DLG4, TGFBR1 and KIT were significantly different between PCa and normal prostate tissue.  Conclusion:   Based on the current study, large-scale effects of interrelated mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and TFs established a new prostate cancer network. In addition, we conducted functional module analysis within the network.

Method:   Twenty cancer survivors (70% female; mean age = 63.0 years, SD = 8.9) and their partners (35% female; mean age = 62.8 years, SD = 7.7) were randomized to either the intervention or waitlist control. Couples in the intervention received four videoconference sessions including training in communication and support skills and behavior change techniques. Measures of PA and partner support for exercise were collected from survivors and partners before randomization and postintervention. Survivors also completed a physical well-being measure, and intervention participants completed a treatment acceptability measure.  Results:   Recruitment was challenging; approximately 18% of eligible survivors and their partners agreed to participate. Ninety-two percent of randomized participants completed postintervention surveys, and 78% of dyads randomized to the intervention arm completed all 4 sessions. Mean acceptability ratings were moderate to high. Mean difference scores suggested that participants in the intervention arm tended to report greater improvements in PA, partner support, and physical well-being than those in the control arm.  Conclusions:   These preliminary findings suggest that the couple-based PA intervention was acceptable to survivors and their partners and that a large-scale RCT is likely to be feasible with modified recruitment strategies. Recommendations for improving recruitment and conducting a larger study are presented.

This article presents a case report of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a patient who was involved in the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and suffered an acute radiation syndrome of degree II severity. Based on clinical and cytogenetic dosimetry, the average absorbed radiation dose to the whole body was estimated to be 4.3 Gy. During long-term clinical follow-up (27 years), moderate transient instability of hematological parameters was observed: lymphocytosis, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which was associated with chronic viral hepatitis C. Further cytogenetic investigations demonstrated a very high frequency of translocations, up to 50 times background values, that persisted over 3 decades. In 2014, the patient was diagnosed and operated on for prostate cancer and received a course of radiotherapy (total fractionated local dose of 35 Gy) in May 2015. From December 2015 through April 2016, the patient experienced general weakness and developed progressive cytopenia. A diagnosis of AML, resulting from a myelodysplastic syndrome, was confirmed by abnormal complex clones detected in 38% of metaphases by the mFISH-method, along with other chromosomal rearrangements.

In this study, we aimed to investigate absorbed doses of 68Ga-PSMA-11. Seven patients (mean age = 66.9 ± 6.6 years, range: 57-79 years) were enrolled in the study. Whole body PET images were acquired with multiple time points. MIRD method, NUKFIT and OLINDA/EXM software were used for dosimetry calculations. Kidneys, bladder wall, salivary and lacrimal glands received the highest absorbed dose. Estimated absorbed doses to these organs after injection of 150 MBq 68Ga-PSMA-11 were 37.0, 12.6, 14.4 and 6.3 mSv, respectively. Effective dose from PET scanning with 150 MBq injected 68Ga-PSMA-11 was 2.5 mSv.

Their interaction with disease-associated miRNAs indicates that circRNAs are important for the development of disease, and miR-145 has been previously shown to have antitumor effect in prostate cancer. In the current study, we successfully established the miR-145-overexpressed prostate cancer LNCaP cells (LNCaP-miR-145) using lentiviral vectors. LNCaP cells expressing the empty vector (LNCaP-NC) were used as the negative control. The circRNA expression in LNCaP-miR-145 cells was detected by microarray analysis, and the miRNA targets of circRNAs were predicted using the bioinformatics software TargetScan and miRanda. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression levels of circRNAs in the prostate cancer tissue, nonmalignant tissue, LNCaP-miR-145 cells, and LNCaP-NC cells. The interaction of miRNA and circRNA was further confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. A total of 267 and 149 circRNAs were significantly up- and downregulated in LNCaP-miR-145 cells, respectively. hsa_circRNA_101981, hsa_circRNA_101996 and hsa_circRNA_09142 were the 3 circRNAs that interacted with hsa-miR-145-5p; hsa_circRNA_008068 and hsa_circRNA_406557 were the 2 circRNAs that interacted with hsa-miR-145-3p. Most of the circRNAs corresponded to the protein-coding exons. The expression levels of hsa_circRNA_101981, hsa_circRNA_00806, and hsa_circRNA_406557 were upregulated in the LNCaP-miR-145 cells, but downregulated in the prostate cancer tissue. In contrast, the expression levels of hsa_circRNA_101996 and hsa_circRNA_091420 were downregulated in the LNCaP-miR-145 cells, but upregulated in the prostate cancer tissue. Moreover, miR-145-5P might regulate the expression of hsa_circRNA_101981, hsa_circRNA_101996, and hsa_circRNA_09142, while miR-145-3P might regulate the expression of hsa_circRNA_008068 and hsa_circRNA_406557. Overexpression of miR-145 promoted the expression of hsa_circRNA_101981, hsa_circRNA_008068, and hsa_circRNA_406557 but suppressed the expressions of hsa_circRNA_101996 and hsa_circRNA_091420 in LNCaP cells.

Methods:   Data were collected from the PROCURE Biobank, a prospective cohort of patients with localized PCa undergoing RP in four academic centers in Québec between 2006 and 2013. Treatment failure was defined as biochemical recurrence and/or initiation of secondary, non-adjuvant therapy, and analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional-hazards models. Uni- and multivariate (ordered) logistic regression was used for time-independent variables.  Results:   1813 patients were included. Median follow-up time was 69 months. Patients who reported a lower BMI were generally older, of Asian descent, and physically more active (p < 0.05). Younger, black, and overweight/obese patients reported less physical activity (p < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, a higher BMI increased the risk for locally advanced, high-risk PCa (defined as a pT3, N1 and/or Gleason 8-10 tumor; odds ratio 1.33, p < 0.001), but increased physical activity did not predict high-risk disease (odds ratio 0.84, p = 0.39). Patients with a higher BMI also had a larger prostate at surgery (odds ratio 1.13, p = 0.03). BMI and physical activity were not associated with positive surgical margins or time to treatment failure (p > 0.05).

Methods:   Hispanics/Latinos diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer within 15 months of treatment completion (n = 288) completed questionnaires as part of an NCI-funded project.  Results:   Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors reported greater unmet needs compared to previously published norms in primarily non-Hispanic/Latino white samples.

Methods:   We used multi-level data, combining individual-level data (including education and known prostate cancer risk factors) for prostate cancer cases (n = 775) and controls (n = 542) from the San Francisco Bay Area Prostate Cancer Study, a population-based case-control study, with contextual-level data on neighborhood socio-economic status (nSES) and specific social and built environment factors from the California Neighborhoods Data System. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to compute adjusted odds ratios separately for localized and advanced stage prostate cancer while controlling for neighborhood clustering.  Results:   We found a more than twofold increased risk of both localized and advanced prostate cancer with increasing levels of nSES, and decreased risk of advanced prostate cancer with increasing levels of education. For localized disease, the nSES association was largely explained by known prostate cancer risk factors and specific neighborhood environment factors; population density, crowding, and residential mobility. For advanced disease, associations with education and nSES were not fully explained by any available individual- or neighborhood-level factors.

We isolated previously from a 30-years old pregnant woman, a clinical isolate of HCMV, that we refered to as the HCMV-DB strain (accession number KT959235). The HCMV-DB clinical isolate demonstrated its ability to infect primary macrophages and to upregulate the proto-oncogene Bcl-3. We observed in this study that the genome of HCMV-DB strain is close to the genomes of other primary clinical isolates including the Toledo and the JP strains with the later having been isolated from a glandular tissue, the prostate. Using a phylogenetic analysis to compare the genes involved in virus entry, we observed that the HCMV-DB strain is close to the HCMV strain Merlin, the prototype HCMV strain. HCMV-DB infects human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) which in turn display a ER-/PR-/HER2- phenotype, commonly refered to as triple negative. The transcriptome of HCMV-DB-infected HMECs presents the characteristics of a pro-oncogenic cellular environment with upregulated expression of numerous oncogenes, enhanced activation of pro-survival genes, and upregulated markers of cell proliferation, stemcellness and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) that was confirmed by enhanced cellular proliferation and tumorsphere formation in vitro. Taken together our data indicate that some clinical isolates could be well adapted to the mammary tissue environment, as it is the case for the HCMV-DB strain. This could influence the viral fitness, ultimately leading to breast cancer development.""","""['Fatima Al Moussawi', 'Amit Kumar', 'Sébastien Pasquereau', 'Manoj K Tripathy', 'Walid Karam', 'Mona Diab-Assaf', 'Georges Herbein']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['The Human Cytomegalovirus Strain DB Activates Oncogenic Pathways in Mammary Epithelial Cells.', 'Distinct Oncogenic Transcriptomes in Human Mammary Epithelial Cells Infected With Cytomegalovirus.', 'Loss of the Human Cytomegalovirus US16 Protein Abrogates Virus Entry into Endothelial and Epithelial Cells by Reducing the Virion Content of the Pentamer.', 'Human cytomegalovirus tropism for endothelial/epithelial cells: scientific background and clinical implications.', 'A Review of the Potential Role of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Infections in Breast Cancer Carcinogenesis and Abnormal Immunity.', 'Detection of Human cytomegalovirus UL55\xa0Gene and IE/E Protein Expression in Colorectal Cancer Patients in Egypt.', 'Human cytomegalovirus in cancer: the mechanism of HCMV-induced carcinogenesis and its therapeutic potential.', 'Indirect effects of cytomegalovirus infection: Implications for vaccine development.', 'High-Risk Oncogenic Human Cytomegalovirus.', 'Polyploid giant cancer cells, EZH2 and Myc upregulation in mammary epithelial cells infected with high-risk human cytomegalovirus.']"""

Although CRPC initially responds to abiraterone and enzalutamide, the disease invariably becomes nonresponsive to these agents. Novel approaches are required to circumvent resistance pathways and to extend survival, but the mechanisms underlying resistance remain poorly defined. Our group previously showed the histone lysine-N-methyltransferase EZH2 to be overexpressed in prostate cancer and quantitatively associated with progression and poor prognosis. In this study, we screened a library of epigenetic inhibitors for their ability to render CRPC cells sensitive to enzalutamide and found that EZH2 inhibitors specifically potentiated enzalutamide-mediated inhibition of proliferation. Moreover, we identified antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) as a novel drug strategy to ablate EZH2 and androgen receptor (AR) expression, which may have advantageous properties in certain settings. RNA-seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing demonstrated that EZH2 inhibition altered the AR cistrome to significantly upregulate AR signaling, suggesting an enhanced dependence of CRPC cells on this pathway following inhibition of EZH2. Combination treatment with ASO targeting EZH2 and AR transcripts inhibited prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo better than single agents. In sum, this study identifies EZH2 as a critical epigenetic regulator of ADT resistance and defines ASO-based cotargeting of EZH2 and AR as a promising strategy for the treatment of CRPC.Significance: Simultaneous targeting of lysine methyltransferase EZH2 and the AR with ASO proves a novel and effective therapeutic strategy in patients with CRPC.

Against this backdrop, we analyzed potential effects of several cancer screening approaches on all-cause mortality in two representative Western European populations.  Methods:   We used mortality data from the UK (England &Wales) and Germany from 2015 and published figures from screening studies on relative reduction in mortality for screened cancers to calculate the expected decline in all-cause mortality in these countries. We determined the required sample size for demonstrating a 3% reduction in all-cause mortality with a narrow (95%) confidence interval in a hypothetical screening trial.  Results:   A relative 20% reduction in breast cancer mortality can be accompanied by a maximum 1.7-1.8% reduction in all-cause mortality in England & Wales and Germany, respectively. Expected declines are smaller for sigmoidoscopy screening (1.0-1.2%), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening (0.4-0.6%), and skin cancer screening (0.2%). To obtain a 95% confidence interval of +/-1% for demonstrating a 3% decline in all-cause mortality, a study size of 596 200 persons is required.  Conclusion:   Because the proportion of cancer deaths in all deaths in Western Europe is relatively low, cancer screening procedures can reduce all-cause mortality by only 1-3%. However, this reduction is relevant to public health.""","""['Andreas Stang', 'Karl-Heinz Jöckel']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Dtsch Arztebl Int""","""['Mammography screening: A major issue in medicine.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Screening for Skin Cancer in Adults: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence-Based Analysis.', 'Mortality From Postscreening (Interval) Colorectal Cancers Is Comparable to That From Cancer in Unscreened Patients-A Randomized Sigmoidoscopy Trial.', 'Role and challenges to digital technologies in community health promotion programs in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multiple embedded case study protocol.', 'Community Health Workers to Increase Cancer Screening: 3 Community Guide Systematic Reviews.', 'HPV prevention in women aged 30-65 in Istanbul: Effect of early diagnosis of cervical cancer.', 'The half-painted picture: Reviewing the mental health impacts of cancer screening.', 'Noncoding RNome as Enabling Biomarkers for Precision Health.']"""

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is a receptor tyrosine kinase, which may mediate signalling to promote progression and invasion of various cancers. In this study, we uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying the interconnection among the androgen receptor (AR), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and EGFR in promoting PCa progression.  Methods:   Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue microarrays consisting of primary and metastatic PCa tissues was performed. The clinical importance of EGFR and its association with survivals were analyzed using three cohorts from MSKCC Prostate Oncogenome Project dataset (For primary tumors, n = 181; for metastatic tumors n = 37) and The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma Provisional dataset (n = 495). Targeted overexpression or inhibition of the proteins of interests was introduced into PCa cell lines. Treatment of PCa cell lines with the compounds was conducted. Immunoblot analysis was performed.  Results:   We showed that AR, MMP-9 and EGFR are interconnect factors, which may cooperatively promote PCa progression. Altered EGFR expression was associated with poor disease-free survival in PCa patients. Induced overexpression of AR led to an increase in the expression of EGFR, p-GSK-3β and decrease in p27 expression in PCa cell lines in the presence of androgen stimulation. Overexpression of MMP9 significantly induced EGFR expression in PCa cells. Inhibition of PIP5K1α, a lipid kinase that acts upstream of PI3K/AKT greatly reduced expressions of AR, MMP-9 and EGFR.  Conclusions:   Our findings also suggest that PCa cells may utilize AR, EGFR and MMP-9 pathways in androgen-dependent as well as in castration-resistant conditions. Our data suggest a new therapeutic potential to block cancer metastasis by targeting AR, EGFR and MMP-9 pathways in subsets of PCa patients.""","""['Anna Mandel', 'Per Larsson', 'Martuza Sarwar', 'Julius Semenas', 'Azharuddin Sajid Syed Khaja', 'Jenny L Persson']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Med""","""['The functional interlink between AR and MMP9/VEGF signaling axis is mediated through PIP5K1α/pAKT in prostate cancer.', 'Epidermal growth factor modulates prostate cancer cell invasiveness regulating urokinase-type plasminogen activator activity.

Methods:   IGF-1 (mature and isoforms) expression was examined by qRT-PCR, both in prostate cancer cells co-incubated with cells of the immune response (IR) and in tumors.

Determination of the expression and localization of IL-6 and IGF-1Ec in prostate tumors was examined by qRT-PCR and by IHC.  Results:   We documented that IL-6 secreted by IR cells activates the JAK2 and STAT3 pathway through IL-6 receptor in cancer cells, leading to the IGF-1Ec upregulation and PEc secretion, as well as to the IL-6 expression and secretion.

Recently, we identified twenty-four heritable methylation marks associated with breast cancer risk. As breast and prostate cancer share genetic risk factors, including rare, high-risk mutations (eg, in BRCA2), we hypothesized that some of these heritable methylation marks might also be associated with the risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We studied 869 incident prostate cancers (430 aggressive and 439 non-aggressive) and 869 matched controls nested within a prospective cohort study. DNA methylation was measured in pre-diagnostic blood samples using the Illumina Infinium HM450K BeadChip. Conditional logistic regression models, adjusted for prostate cancer risk factors and blood cell composition, were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between the 24 methylation marks and the risk of prostate cancer.

Methods:   We measured PSA in serum specimens collected in 1995-7 (baseline) and 2004-6 (follow-up) from 265 men diagnosed with chlamydia (CT), 72 with gonorrhea (GC), 37 with non-chlamydial, non-gonococcal urethritis (NCNGU), 58 with infectious mononucleosis (IM), 91 with other systemic or non-genitourinary infections such as varicella; and 125-258 men with no infectious disease diagnoses in their medical record during follow-up (controls). We examined the influence of these infections on PSA change between baseline and follow-up.  Results:   The proportion of men with any increase in PSA (>0 ng/mL) over the 10-year average follow-up was significantly higher in men with histories of sexually transmitted infections (CT, GC, and NCNGU; 67.7% vs 60.8%, P = 0.043), systemic infections (66.7% vs 54.4%, P = 0.047), or any infections (all cases combined; 68.5% vs 54.4%, P = 0.003) in their military medical record compared to controls.  Conclusions:   While PSA has been previously shown to rise during acute infection, these findings demonstrate that PSA remains elevated over a longer period.

The variables concerned health status, marital satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect, prostate cancer-specific anxiety, and HRQOL. The Actor-Partner-Interdependence Model was adopted for data analysis.  Results:   The people who had better physical HRQOL were those with good self-reported health status, higher positive affect and lower prostate cancer-specific anxiety. Better physical HRQOL was observed in the spouses who had good self-reported health status and had lower prostate cancer-specific anxiety. The people with localized cancer stages and lower negative affect had a better mental HRQOL. Better mental HRQOL was detected in spouses who had higher marital satisfaction, higher positive affect and lower negative affect.

The production of components of the protein synthesis machinery can be regulated at the transcriptional level by specific factors. It has been shown that the product of the oncogene Myc, a transcription factor frequently activated in cancer, can control translational activity through an increase in the transcription of the eIF4F complex components (eIF4E, eIF4AI, and eIF4GI). However, additional effects at the posttranslational level have also been described. For instance, it has been shown that Myc upregulation can induce mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) hyperphosphorylation. We induced overexpression or inhibition of Myc through transfection of complementary DNA constructs or specific small interfering RNA in PC3 (prostate carcinoma) and HeLa (cervical carcinoma) cells. We have observed that overexpression of Myc causes an increase in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and activation of protein synthesis. Unexpectedly, we detected a parallel decrease in the phosphorylation level of S6 kinase (in PC3 and HeLa) and AKT (in HeLa).

The c-Myc upregulated lncRNA MYU (VPS9D1 antisense RNA1, annotated as VPS9D1-AS1) has been reported in several common types of human cancers, which has revealed that lncRNA MYU could function as either an oncogene or a tumor-suppressor gene in different cancer types. However, the function of lncRNA MYU in prostate cancer remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that lncRNA MYU is significantly upregulated in prostate cancer tissues. MYU knockdown impaired prostate cancer cell growth and migration as shown from cell viability, colony formation, Transwell and wound healing assays. In contrast, MYU overexpression displayed opposite effects. No correlation was noted between MYU and its cognate VPS9D1 expression level. Moreover, lncRNA MYU did not regulate the expression of VPS9D1 either at the mRNA or protein level as detected using qRT-PCR and western blotting assays. Furthermore, lncRNA MYU was able to be transported into the extracellular milieu by means of exosomes, and then promoted adjacent cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, lncRNA MYU upregulated c-Myc by competitively binding miR-184 and then induced the proliferation of prostate cancer. Thus, this study demonstrated that lncRNA MYU functions as an oncogene in prostate cancer at least in part through the miR-184/c-Myc axis, and may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target.""","""['Jinhua Wang', 'Xiaohui Yang', 'Rong Li', 'Liang Wang', 'Yinmin Gu', 'Yuhui Zhao', 'Kuo Hsiang Huang', 'Tianyou Cheng', 'Yi Yuan', 'Shan Gao']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Long non-coding RNA MYU promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation by sponging miR-6827-5p and upregulating HMGA1.', 'C-Myc-activated long non-coding RNA PVT1 enhances the proliferation of cervical cancer cells by sponging miR-486-3p.', 'ZEB1 activated-VPS9D1-AS1 promotes the tumorigenesis and progression of prostate cancer by sponging miR-4739 to upregulate MEF2D.', 'Intricate crosstalk between MYC and non-coding RNAs regulates hallmarks of cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA PVT1 interacts with MYC and its downstream molecules to synergistically promote tumorigenesis.', 'Long non-coding RNA MYU promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation by sponging miR-6827-5p and upregulating HMGA1.', 'Exosomal miRNAs-a diagnostic biomarker acting as a guiding light in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'In vitro model of predicting metastatic ability using tumor derived extracellular vesicles; beyond seed soil hypothesis.', 'The diagnostic role and mechanistic functions of exosomal lncRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Natural antisense transcripts as drug targets.']"""

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of PTCD3 and its clinical significance in PCa. Immunohistochemistry and dataset analyses revealed that PTCD3 protein expression levels were enhanced in human PCa tissues and mouse PCa models. PTCD3 expression levels were positively correlated with advanced PCa pathological grade and clinical stage. Additionally, PTCD3 mRNA expression was positively correlated with tissue malignancy, high Gleason score and distant metastasis in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. Kaplan‑Meier analysis revealed that high PTCD3 levels can predict the increased biochemical recurrence (BCR)‑free survival in all patients with or without metastasis. The overexpression of PTCD3 could be used as an independent prognostic marker of poor BCR‑free survival. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis in human PCa cell lines further confirmed that PTCD3 levels were associated with the hormone independence of PCa.

Anti-silencing function 1B histone chaperone (ASF1B) has been reported to be involved in PCa. The present study aimed to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of ASF1B in PCa. Data of genes were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The core gene was identified using the DAVID website. Cell viability and colony formation were detected using a cell counting kit-8 assay and crystal violet staining, respectively. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were assessed using flow cytometry analysis. The corresponding factors were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. It was demonstrated that ASF1B was highly expressed in the PCa tissues and cells compared with the non-PCa tissues and cells, respectively. While siRNA-ASF1B significantly reduced the viability and colony formation, it promoted apoptosis, G1 phase cell cycle arrest of LNCap as well as C4-2 cells. siRNA-ASF1B was revealed to significantly reduce the level of B-cell lymphoma-2 and cyclin D1, and enhance the expression levels of p53, caspase-3 and Bcl-2 associated X protein. Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) were significantly decreased in the siRNA-ASF1B group compared with the mock group. In summary, the present study demonstrated that silencing of ASF1B suppressed the proliferation, and promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of PCa cells. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was pertinent to the role of si-ASF1B.

Methods:   Sixty patients with prostate cancer were included in the period May 2016 to June 2017. The participants underwent three scans (index tests) within 30 days: a NaF-PET/CT, a WB-MRI and a PSMA-PET/CT. Experienced specialists assessed the scans. In the absence of a histological reference standard, the final diagnosis was determined as a panel diagnosis. Measures of the diagnostic performances of the index tests were calculated from patient-based dichotomous outcomes (0 or ≥ 1 bone metastasis) and pairwise compared (McNemar test). For each index test, the agreement with the final diagnosis with regard to the number of bone metastases detected (0, 1-5, > 5) and the inter-reader agreement was calculated (kappa coefficients).  Results:   Fifty-five patients constituted the final study population; 20 patients (36%) were classified as having bone metastatic disease as their final diagnosis.

Using this approach, we discovered that loss-of-function of TP53 can promote the development of resistance of castration in prostate cancer cells via both transiently potentiating androgen-independent cell growth and facilitating the occurrence of genome instability. The study thus reveals a novel genetic basis underlying the development of castration resistance in prostate cancer cells and provides a facile genetic approach for studying a cancer gene of interest in versatile experimental conditions.""","""['Kefeng Lei', 'Ran Sun', 'Lee H Chen', 'Bill H Diplas', 'Casey J Moure', 'Wenzhe Wang', 'Landon J Hansen', 'Yulei Tao', 'Xufeng Chen', 'Chin-Pu Jason Chen', 'Paula K Greer', 'Fangping Zhao', 'Hai Yan', 'Darell D Bigner', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Yiping He']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['TP53 loss-of-function causes vulnerability to autophagy inhibition in aggressive prostate cancer.', 'PDCD4 Is an Androgen-Repressed Tumor Suppressor that Regulates Prostate Cancer Growth and Castration Resistance.', 'NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Molecular pathology of prostate cancer.', 'Revisiting the Role of p53 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Immune-Related Genes Are Prognostic Markers for Prostate Cancer Recurrence.', 'Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Prostate Cancer Development: Therapeutic Implications.', 'Loss of KMT2D induces prostate cancer ROS-mediated DNA damage by suppressing the enhancer activity and DNA binding of antioxidant transcription factor FOXO3.', 'Predicting clinical outcome of therapy-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Cell division cycle-associated protein 1 (CDCA1) is expressed highly in many cancer cells. Yet, whether CDCA1 play an important role in PCa progression is uncertain. pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP), a PH-induced transmembrane structure, can pass through the cell membrane into intracellular in an acidic environment. In this study, we try to confirm the expression status of CDCA1 in the PCa patients' tissues and PCa cell line. In addition, to make the CDCA1-siRNA efficiently targeting the PCa cells, pHLIP and CDCA1-siRNA were combined with disulfide bond to become effector molecules. By the characteristics of the pHLIP allosteric occurring in cancer tissue acidic microenvironment, CDCA1-siRNA may be transported specificity into prostatic cancer cells and released in the cytoplasm. The interference effect of the effector molecules on the CDCA1 was detected in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that CDCA1 was highly expressed in PCa cell line and human PCa clinical samples. Knock down CDCA1 significantly inhibit the growth and promote the apoptosis of prostatic cancer cells. In the intracellular translocation experiment, CDCA1-siRNA could be delivered into cytoplasma at pH 6.2, but not at pH 7.4. In the in vivo test, the tumor size was reduced obviously in the NOD/SCID mice treated with pHLIP-CDCA1-siRNA compared to the CDCA1-siRNA and the bioluminescent signal of Cy5-pHLIP-CDCA1-siRNA was focused detected in the tumor site. Our findings indicated that CDCA1 might be a very key molecule regulating survival and proliferation of PCa. pHLIP-CDCA1-siRNA might be a promising targeting therapy for PCa.""","""['Zhining Zhao', 'Changyu Li', 'Bin Song', 'Jinbo Sun', 'Xiaoliang Fu', 'Fan Yang', 'He Wang', 'Bo Yan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Multifunctional Envelope-Type siRNA Delivery Nanoparticle Platform for Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'siRNA-mediated knockdown against CDCA1 and KNTC2, both frequently overexpressed in colorectal and gastric cancers, suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis.', '64Cu-1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-Tris-acetic acid-10-maleimidoethylacetamide-ACEQNPIYWARYADWLFTTPLLLLDLALLVDADEGTG.', 'RNA interference targeting PSCA suppresses primary tumor growth and metastasis formation of human prostate cancer xenografts in SCID mice.', 'Recent Advances in Imaging Agents Anchored with pH (Low) Insertion Peptides for Cancer Theranostics.', 'Ca2+ -dependent interactions between lipids and the tumor-targeting peptide pHLIP.', 'CDCA1/2/3/5/7/8 as novel prognostic biomarkers and CDCA4/6 as potential targets for gastric cancer.', 'Roles of key residues and lipid dynamics reveal pHLIP-membrane interactions at intermediate pH.', 'The roles of the cell division cycle-associated gene family in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Progress in Delivery of siRNA-Based Therapeutics Employing Nano-Vehicles for Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

In this study, analyzing the expression of miR-152 by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed it was sharply reduced in CC tissues and cell lines. In addition, the negative correlation of miR-152 expression and KLF5 expression was observed. The dual-luciferase reporter assay validated that KLF5 was a target of miR-152. In vitro functional assays revealed that miR-152 could inhibit cell proliferation and cell cycle progression through regulating the expression of KLF5.

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the patterns and expression levels of 2 putative stem cell markers, survivin and Sox9, in canine benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatic carcinoma to investigate their potential as stem cell markers. Immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies was performed on 3 samples of normal prostate gland, 18 samples of canine BPH, and 16 samples of prostatic carcinoma. The basal cell layer of normal and hyperplastic prostatic lobules had nuclear Sox9 immunolabeling and nuclear and rarely cytoplasmic survivin immunostaining, identifying them as potential stem cell markers. Significantly more frequent survivin and Sox9 expression (≥10% of nuclei) was observed in prostatic carcinoma as compared with BPH. The potential coexpression of survivin with Sox9, androgen receptor, and p63 was also investigated in selected BPH and prostatic carcinoma cases with immunofluorescence, and a partial colocalization was observed. Results indicate that Sox9 and survivin could be considered markers of stemness in canine prostate cells.

Due to limited population data, however, disease surveillance statistics are typically truncated at age 84 years and then grouped into a terminal age category of ≥85 years. We used more detailed older age data from the 2010 census in conjunction with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry records for 2008-2012 diagnoses to estimate 5-year age-specific incidence rates through ages 90-94 years and ≥95 years for major cancers. Overall cancer rates increased to a maximum in the 80-89-year ranges and subsequently declined. Incidence rates peaked in younger age groups for several specific cancers, including breast, cervix uteri, corpus uteri, and prostate. Whereas, rates for colon and rectum, leukemia, melanoma, pancreas, stomach, and urinary bladder continued to rise among men and women into their early 90s. Rates of liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer showed an initial spike among men aged 60-64 years followed by a larger peak at ages 80-84. Since these age-specific incidence patterns were based on cross-sectional data, they may vary over time for some cancers (eg, lung and liver) as the prevalence of major risk factors change across birth cohorts. Future studies using new, publicly available databases with these additional older age groups can examine cancer subtypes defined by our emerging understanding of molecular biomarkers.

A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is an established tool used in geriatric medicine to identify unmet need requiring intervention. This study aimed to assess whether using a CGA in older male cancer patients with incurable but manageable disease provides information that would alter a cancer clinician's intended management plan. Acceptability and feasibility were secondary aims.  Methods:   Elderly men with incurable but manageable malignancies (advanced prostate cancer and multiple myeloma) who had previously received at least one line of treatment were recruited from hospital outpatient clinics. A CGA was undertaken. Additional parameters measuring pain, fatigue and disease-specific concerns were also recorded, at the recommendation of patient involvement groups. Results were made available to clinicians. Patient and clinician acceptability and changes in subsequent management were recorded.  Results:   Forty-eight patients completed the study. The median ages were 70.8 years and 74 years for myeloma and prostate respectively. Most identified concerns are related to disease-specific concerns (93%), pain (91%), frailty (57%) and nutrition (52%). Results altered the clinician's oncological management plan in nine cases only. Patients found the format and content of CGA acceptable.  Conclusions:   Many unmet needs were identified in this population of elderly men with manageable but non curable cancer which led to supportive care referrals and interventions.

Methods and materials:   Ninety-nine men (median age: 69.4 years) with cT3a/bN0M0 high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma received definitive LDR-BT or LDR-BT boost after external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) at a single institution between 1998 and 2007. About 86% of patients received androgen deprivation therapy. Freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method with the Phoenix definition used as definition of failure. Cox regression analysis was used to compare outcomes between clinical stage, initial PSA, Gleason Score, and percent core positive rate.  Results:   With a median followup of 7 years, 7-year rate of FFBF, PCSS, and OS for the entire cohort was 65.2% (±5.6%), 90.1% (±3.6%), and 77.9% (±4.7%), respectively.

Qualitative evidence regarding cost outcomes is lacking.  Objective:   This study assessed how costs were affected by robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) compared with open surgery.  Design, setting, and participants:   Cost analysis was based on the dataset of the LAPPRO (Laparoscopic Prostatectomy Robot Open) clinical trial, which is a prospective controlled, nonrandomised trial of patients who underwent prostatectomy at 14 centres in Sweden between September 2008 and November 2011. Currently, data are available from a follow-up period of 24 mo.  Intervention:   In the LAPPRO trial, RALP was compared with radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Costs per surgical technique were assessed based on resource variable data from the LAPPRO database. The calculation of average costs was based on mean values; Swedish currency was converted to purchasing power parity US dollar (PPP$). All tests were two-tailed and conducted at α=0.05 significance level.  Results and limitations:   The cost analysis comprised 2638 men. Based on the LAPPRO trial data, RALP was associated with an increased cost/procedure of PPP$ 3837 (95% confidence interval: 2747-4928) compared with RRP. The result was sensitive to variations in caseload. Main drivers of overall cost were robotic system cost, operation time, length of stay, and sick leave. Limitations of the study include the uneven distribution between RALP and RRP regarding procedures in public/for-profit hospitals and surgeon/centre procedural volume.  Conclusions:   Based on the LAPPRO trial data, this study showed that RALP was associated with an increased cost compared with RRP in Swedish health care. There are many factors influencing the costs, making the absolute result dependent on the specific setting. However, by identifying the main cost drivers and/or most influential parameters, the study provides support for informed decisions and predictions.  Patient summary:   In this study, we looked at the cost outcome when performing prostatectomies by robot-assisted laparoscopic technique compared with open surgery in Sweden.

IGF-1 binds to IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) and insulin receptor (IR), activating cancer hallmark pathways. Experimental evidence suggests that TMPRSS2:ERG may interact with IGF/insulin signaling to influence progression. We investigated IGF1R and IR expression and its association with lethal prostate cancer among 769 men. Protein expression of IGF1R, IR and ERG (i.e. a surrogate of ERG fusion genes) were assayed by immunohistochemistry. Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for clinical characteristics. Among patients, 29% had strong tumor IGF1R expression and 10% had strong IR expression. During a mean follow-up of 13.2 years through 2012, 80 men (11%) developed lethal disease. Tumors with strong IGF1R or IR expression showed increased cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis and a higher prevalence of ERG. In multivariable models, strong IGF1R was associated with a borderline increased risk of lethal prostate cancer (HR 1.7; 95% CI 0.9-3.1). The association appeared greater in ERG-positive tumors (HR 2.8; 95% CI 0.9-8.4) than in ERG-negative tumors (HR 1.3; 95% CI 0.6-3.0, p-heterogeneity 0.08). There was no association between IR and lethal prostate cancer (HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.4-1.9).

Our findings indicate that incorporation of an appropriate amino group to 3-OH of 3',4'-dimethoxyflavonol and 3',4',7-trimethoxyflavonol through a 3- to 5-carbon linker can substantially improve the in vitro antiproliferative potency in three human prostate cancer cell models, but not in two non-neoplastic human epithelial cell models (MCF 10A and PWR-1E). 1-Methylpiperazine, pyrrolidine, and dibutylamine are optimal terminal amine groups that, in combination with a 3- to 5-carbon linker, are notably beneficial to the anti-proliferative potency of 3-O-substituted-3',4'-dimethoxyflavonols.

The androgen receptor (AR) - a hormone inducible transcription factor - drives expression of tumor promoting genes and represents an important therapeutic target in PCa. The AR is activated by steroid recruitment to its ligand binding domain (LBD), followed by receptor nuclear translocation and dimerization via the DNA binding domain (DBD). Clinically used small molecules interfere with steroid recruitment and prevent AR-driven tumor growth, but are rendered ineffective by emergence of LBD mutations or expression of constitutively active variants, such as ARV7, that lack the LBD. Both drug-resistance mechanisms confound treatment of this 'castration resistant' stage of PCa (CRPC), characterized by return of AR signalling. Here, we employ computer-aided drug-design to develop small molecules that block the AR-DBD dimerization interface, an attractive target given its role in AR activation and independence from the LBD. Virtual screening on the AR-DBD structure led to development of prototypical compounds that block AR dimerization, inhibiting AR-transcriptional activity through a LBD-independent mechanism.

This causes concerns about interval cancers, which have been proposed to progress more rapidly.

Methods:   We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized sigmoidoscopy screening trial in Norway with 98,684 participants (age range, 50-64 years) who were randomly assigned to groups that were (n = 20,552) or were not (n = 78,126) invited for sigmoidoscopy screening from 1999 through 2001; participants were followed up for a median 14.8 years. We compared CRC mortality and all-cause mortality between individuals who underwent screening and were diagnosed with CRC 30 days or longer after screening (interval cancer group, n = 163) and individuals diagnosed with CRC in the nonscreened group (controls, n = 1740). All CRCs in the control group were identified when they developed symptoms (clinically detected CRCs). Analyses were stratified by cancer site. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratio (HRs), adjusted for age and sex.

In contrast, ETS1p51 protein, the only ETS1 isoform detected, was expressed at significantly higher levels in malignant prostate. Analysis of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes regulated following overexpression of ETS1p51 in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line predicted promotion of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling and of EMT. ETS1p51 overexpression upregulated cellular levels of the EMT transcriptional regulators, ZEB1 and SNAIL1, resulted in reduced expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin with concomitantly elevated levels of claudin 1, an epithelial tight junction protein, and increased prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. ETS1p51-induced activation of the pro-EMT TGFβ signaling pathway that was predicted in polymerase chain reaction arrays was verified by demonstration of elevated SMAD2 phosphorylation following ETS1p51 overexpression. Attenuation of ETS1p51 effects on prostate cancer cell migration and invasion by inhibition of TGFβ pathway signaling indicated that ETS1p51 effects were in part mediated by induction of TGFβ signaling.

Although efficacy has been shown in mice on a behavioral level, effectiveness in preventing pain-induced functional rearrangements in the central nervous system has not been shown. Therefore, we assessed longitudinal whole-brain functional connectivity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a mouse model of cancer-induced bone pain. We found functional connectivity between major hubs of ascending and descending pain pathways such as the periaqueductal gray, amygdala, thalamus, and cortical somatosensory regions to be affected by a developing cancer pain state. These changes could be successfully prevented through prospective administration of a monoclonal anti-NGF antibody (mAb911). This indicates efficacy of anti-NGF treatment to prevent pain-induced adaptations in brain functional networks after persistent nociceptive input from cancer-induced bone pain.

However, the age-specific cumulative risk (penetrance) of these cancers is still poorly defined for PMS2-associated Lynch syndrome. Using a large data set from a worldwide collaboration, our aim was to determine accurate penetrance measures of cancers for carriers of heterozygous pathogenic PMS2 variants.  Methods:   A modified segregation analysis was conducted that incorporated both genotyped and nongenotyped relatives, with conditioning for ascertainment to estimates corrected for bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs were estimated for each cancer site for mutation carriers compared with the general population, followed by estimation of penetrance.  Results:   In total, 284 families consisting of 4,878 first- and second-degree family members were included in the analysis. PMS2 mutation carriers were at increased risk for colorectal cancer (cumulative risk to age 80 years of 13% [95% CI, 7.9% to 22%] for males and 12% [95% CI, 6.7% to 21%] for females) and endometrial cancer (13% [95% CI, 7.0%-24%]), compared with the general population (6.6%, 4.7%, and 2.4%, respectively). There was no clear evidence of an increased risk of ovarian, gastric, hepatobiliary, bladder, renal, brain, breast, prostate, or small bowel cancer.  Conclusion:   Heterozygous PMS2 mutation carriers were at small increased risk for colorectal and endometrial cancer but not for any other Lynch syndrome-associated cancer. This finding justifies that PMS2-specific screening protocols could be restricted to colonoscopies. The role of risk-reducing hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for PMS2 mutation carriers needs further discussion.""","""['Sanne W Ten Broeke', 'Heleen M van der Klift', 'Carli M J Tops', 'Stefan Aretz', 'Inge Bernstein', 'Daniel D Buchanan', 'Albert de la Chapelle', 'Gabriel Capella', 'Mark Clendenning', 'Christoph Engel', 'Steven Gallinger', 'Encarna Gomez Garcia', 'Jane C Figueiredo', 'Robert Haile', 'Heather L Hampel', 'John L Hopper', 'Nicoline Hoogerbrugge', 'Magnus von Knebel Doeberitz', 'Loic Le Marchand', 'Tom G W Letteboer', 'Mark A Jenkins', 'Annika Lindblom', 'Noralane M Lindor', 'Arjen R Mensenkamp', 'Pål Møller', 'Polly A Newcomb', 'Theo A M van Os', 'Rachel Pearlman', 'Marta Pineda', 'Nils Rahner', 'Egbert J W Redeker', 'Maran J W Olderode-Berends', 'Christophe Rosty', 'Hans K Schackert', 'Rodney Scott', 'Leigha Senter', 'Liesbeth Spruijt', 'Verena Steinke-Lange', 'Manon Suerink', 'Stephen Thibodeau', 'Yvonne J Vos', 'Anja Wagner', 'Ingrid Winship', 'Frederik J Hes', 'Hans F A Vasen', 'Juul T Wijnen', 'Maartje Nielsen', 'Aung Ko Win']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Errata.', 'Cancer risks by gene, age, and gender in 6350 carriers of pathogenic mismatch repair variants: findings from the Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database.', 'The clinical phenotype of Lynch syndrome due to germ-line PMS2 mutations.', 'Cancer incidence and survival in Lynch syndrome patients receiving colonoscopic and gynaecological surveillance: first report from the prospective Lynch syndrome database.', 'Lynch Syndrome.', 'PMS2 monoallelic mutation carriers: the known unknown.', 'Beyond germline genetic testing - heterozygous pathogenic variants in PMS2 in two children with Osteosarcoma and Ependymoma.', 'Microsatellite Instability: A Review of Molecular Epidemiology and Implications for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy.', 'Hereditary colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer: comprehensive review.', 'The ""scope"" of colorectal cancer screening in Lynch syndrome: is there an optimal interval?', 'Lynch Syndrome and Gynecologic Tumors: Incidence, Prophylaxis, and Management of Patients with Cancer.']"""

TNF-α has attracted intense attention as a potential therapeutic agent against various cancers. However, its therapeutic application is restricted by short half life and severe toxic side-effects. In this study, we constructed a stable nanodrug, called TNF-α-derived polypeptide (P16)-conjugated, chitosan (CTS)-modified selenium nanoparticle (SC; SCP), which is composed of SC as a slow-release carrier conjugated to P16. SCP had significant inhibitory effects on multiple types of tumor cells, especially DU145 prostate cancer cells, but not on RWPE-1 normal human prostate epithelial cells. SCP could induce G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in DU145 cells more effectively than could P16 and TNF-α. In DU145 xenograft tumor models, SCP exerted much stronger antitumor effects than P16 or estramustine (the clinical drug for prostate cancer) but caused fewer toxic side-effects. In addition, SCP significantly inhibited proliferation and accelerated apoptosis in DU145 xenograft tumors. Further mechanistic studies revealed that SCP exerted antitumor effects via activation of the p38 MAPK/JNK pathway, thus inducing G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. These findings suggest that SCP may represent a potential long-lasting therapeutic agent for human prostate cancer with fewer side effects.-Yan, Q., Chen, X., Gong, H., Qiu, P., Xiao, X., Dang, S., Hong, A., Ma, Y.

Materials and methods:   All men who underwent multiparametric MRI of the prostate performed using a 3-T scanner with endorectal and phased-array surface coils, followed by prostatectomy conducted between November 2015 and July 2016 at our institution, were identified. MRI examinations were independently reviewed by five readers with varying degrees of experience, two of whom had essentially no experience in prostate MRI interpretation before the study, to assess index lesion size and ADC values. A linear mixed model-based intraclass correlation was used to assess intra- and interreader reader agreement for lesion size and ADC measurements and agreement for size measurements between pathologic analysis and readers.  Results:   A total of 80 men met the study eligibility criteria. Overall inter- and intrareader agreement for ADC measurements was excellent, with interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values of 0.84 and 0.90, respectively; both inter- and intrareader agreement between experienced readers (0.82 and 0.92, respectively) and inexperienced readers (0.86 and 0.87, respectively) were excellent as well. The agreement between mean lesion size on imaging and histopathologic analysis ranged from poor (0.32) to good (0.66), with overall agreement considered fair (0.49).

Methods:   In a case-control study, 360 subjects were included (180 men with PCa and 180 healthy controls). XRCC1-Arg399Gln genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. In the meta-analysis, 14 eligible studies were included to which our case-control data were added to estimate the pooled odds ratios. Some bioinformatics tools were employed to evaluate the effects of Arg399Gln substitution on molecular aspects of the XRCC1 protein.  Results:   Our case-control study revealed a significant association between the XRCC1-Arg399Gln polymorphism and PCa risk. The data from overall meta-analysis showed significant associations between the mentioned polymorphism and PCa risk in allelic and recessive genetic models. In addition, we observed statistically significant associations in stratified analyses by ethnicity, sample size and source of controls. Our in silico analysis showed that Arg399Gln substitution could be damaging with respect to the function and structure of the XRCC1 protein.

We studied the concordance of biopsy and prostatectomy diagnosis for these two subpathologies in relationship with pathological stage.  Methods and results:   Mandatory synoptic reporting of intraductal and cribriform carcinoma in prostate biopsies and prostatectomy specimens was adopted by two academic institutions in November 2015. Synoptic reports of 245 biopsy and corresponding prostatectomy specimens were interrogated to determine the prevalence of intraductal and cribriform carcinoma. Sensitivity and specificity were determined, with prostatectomy diagnosis as the gold standard. Associations with pathological stage as primary outcome parameter were determined using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Prevalence of the combination of intraductal and cribriform carcinoma was 26.9% in biopsies and 51.8% in prostatectomy specimens. Sensitivity and specificity at biopsy were 47.2% and 94.9%, respectively. Intraductal and cribriform carcinoma at biopsy were associated with advanced pathological stage independent of grade (P = 0.013). Among patients with grade group 2 prostate cancer at biopsy, the more advanced pathological stage distribution was similar for those with a false negative and a true positive biopsy diagnosis of intraductal and cribriform carcinoma (P = 0.29).  Conclusion:   In spite of low sensitivity, intraductal and cribriform carcinoma at biopsy was associated strongly with advanced stage at radical prostatectomy. As a false negative biopsy diagnosis was equally associated with advanced pathological stage, efforts should be undertaken to improve the sensitivity of biopsy diagnosis for intraductal and cribriform carcinoma.""","""['Mehdi Masoomian', 'Michelle R Downes', 'Joan Sweet', 'Carol Cheung', 'Andrew J Evans', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Manjula Maganti', 'Theodorus Van der Kwast']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Diagnostic Accuracy of Prostate Biopsy for Detecting Cribriform Gleason Pattern 4 Carcinoma and Intraductal Carcinoma in Paired Radical Prostatectomy Specimens: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Concordance of cribriform architecture in matched prostate cancer biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Presence of invasive cribriform or intraductal growth at biopsy outperforms percentage grade 4 in predicting outcome of Gleason score 3+4=7 prostate cancer.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate Gland: Recent Advances.', 'Atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: clinical significance, differential diagnosis and current concept of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Oncological outcomes of cribriform histology pattern in prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Percentage Gleason pattern 4 and PI-RADS score predict upgrading in biopsy Grade Group 2 prostate cancer patients without cribriform pattern.', 'WHO Classification of Tumours fifth edition: evolving issues in the classification, diagnosis, and prognostication of prostate cancer.', 'Current conundrums with cribriform prostate cancer.', 'Infiltrative growth pattern of prostate cancer is associated with lower uptake on PSMA PET and reduced diffusion restriction on mpMRI.']"""

Background:   Cytokines play an important role in carcinogenesis. Most of them are produced by macrophages. Macrophages are divided into groups M1 or M2. Classical phenotype macrophages M1 support pro-inflammatory effects and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Macrophages exhibiting a phenotype M2 secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, e. g. interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β).  Methods:   Peripheral blood monocytes were cultivated for 7 days and during this time went through a differentiation into macrophages. Macrophages were stimulated for 24 hours by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a positive control and cultivated with supernatant for another 24 hours.  Results:   Macrophages cultivated without LPS and without supernatant were used as negative control. Relative expression of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-α was measured by Quantitative real-time PCR.

Conclusion:   Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was lower in macrophages with supernatant (MΦ+sup) compared to positive control (MΦ+LPS).

Next-generation sequencing was used to discover differences in miRNA expression between serum samples from PCa patients and healthy controls, and the results were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Detection of the miRNA of interest was attempted in prostate tissue by in situ hybridization. All samples were collected in collaboration with Biobank1® . By miRNA sequencing of serum samples, significant expression of some miRNAs in patients with PCa and healthy controls was detected.

Correlation NMR and linkage analyses confirmed that LMMGFs consist mainly of α-fucose and β-galactose units: α-fucose units are 1,3-linked; β-galactose units are terminal, 1,3- and/or 1,6-linked; both sugars are partially sulphated, fucose at positions O-2 and/or O-4 and galactose at O-3. Mannose residue, as a minor sugar, presents as the 1,4-linked terminal units. LMMGFs more significantly induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and cell death via suppression of the Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway than MF in human PC-3 prostate cancer cells. LMMGFs upregulated mRNA expression of death receptor-5 (DR-5), the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2, the cleavage of caspases and PARP, the depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and ROS generation. LMMGFs (200-400 mg/kg) effectively reduced both tumour volume and size in a xenografted mouse model. These results demonstrated that LMMGFs attenuate the growth of human prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that LMMGFs can be used as a potent functional ingredient in health-beneficial foods or as a therapeutic agent to prevent or treat androgen-independent human prostate cancer.

Design:   Cross-sectional observational study.  Setting:   Uroandrological outpatient clinic of a European academic centre.  Participants:   Data of 1059 patients at their first access for uroandrological purposes from January 2014 to December 2016 were analysed.  Intervention:   Patients were invited to complete a survey with closed questions investigating their attitude towards AS, prior to any clinical evaluation. Likewise, patients were invited to score the importance given to different aspects of personal life in the case of a cancer diagnosis, using a 10-point Likert scale.  Primary and secondary outcomes measures:   The reported opinion towards AS management for cancer was assessed. Logistic regression analyses tested participants' sociodemographic characteristics associated with a positive opinion on AS.  Results:   Positive, negative and doubtful attitudes towards AS were observed in 347 (33%), 331 (31%) and 381 (36%) patients, respectively. Female patients were more likely to report a negative attitude towards AS (38.7% vs 29.6%, p=0.04) while patients with previous parenthood more frequently reported a positive opinion on AS (37.2% vs 29.9%, p=0.005).

These have been investigated in the past in various cancers such as breast, prostate and colon. ZA in particular has shown promising results in pre-clinical studies. We propose a multicentre double-blind randomised controlled feasibility study to assess the recruitment and acceptability of ZA/placebo alongside chemotherapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).  Methods:   Patients will be recruited for a 13-month period from October 2016 to November 2017. Eligible patients will be identified via the regional mesothelioma multidisciplinary team meeting. Those who receive chemotherapy will be randomised to receive either ZA or placebo alongside their chemotherapy. Those who decline chemotherapy will be offered to join the trial on the non-randomised open-labelled arm of the trial. Patients will receive a maximum of six cycles of ZA/placebo, at three-weekly cycles. All patients will be followed up for six months from randomisation. Semi-structured interviews to gather data on acceptability of trial procedures, tolerability of ZA and other relevant information will take place after the participants have completed their six cycles of treatment. For a better understanding about non-participation in mesothelioma trials we also aim to interview those who decline to take part in the trial.  Discussion:   The qualitative and quantitative data gathered in this feasibility trial will hopefully pave the way to designing a robust full phase III trial to investigate the potential synergistic effect of ZA and current standard treatment for MPM, cisplatin-pemetrexed combination chemotherapy.

Administering standard chemotherapy 2-weekly rather than 3-weekly, so-called 'accelerating chemotherapy', has improved cure rates in other cancers. An Australian multicentre phase 2 trial demonstrated this regimen is feasible and tolerable with efficacy data that appears promising. The aim of this trial is to determine if accelerated BEP is superior to standard BEP as first line chemotherapy for adult and paediatric male and female participants with intermediate and poor risk metastatic GCTs.  Methods:   This is an open label, randomised, stratified, 2-arm, international multicentre, 2 stage, phase 3 clinical trial. Participants are randomised 1:1 to receive accelerated BEP or standard BEP chemotherapy. Eligible male or female participants, aged between 11 and 45 years with intermediate or poor-risk metastatic GCTs for first line chemotherapy will be enrolled from Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Participants will have regular follow up for at least 5 years. The primary endpoint for stage 1 of the trial (n = 150) is complete response rate and for the entire trial (n = 500) is progression free survival. Secondary endpoints include response following treatment completion (by a protocol-specific response criteria), adverse events, health-related quality of life, treatment preference, delivered dose-intensity of chemotherapy (relative to standard BEP), overall survival and associations between biomarkers (to be specified) and their correlations with clinical outcomes.  Discussion:   This is the first international randomised clinical trial for intermediate and poor-risk metastatic extra-cranial GCTs involving both adult and pediatric age groups open to both males and females. It is also the largest, current randomised trial for germ cell tumours in the world. Positive results for this affordable intervention could change the global standard of care for intermediate and poor risk germ cell tumours, improve cure rates, avoid the need for toxic and costly salvage treatment, and return young adults to long, healthy and productive lives.

Thus, we tried to investigate the real-life accuracy of combinatory approach of using both transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostatic biopsy and mpMRI in predicting the laterality of PCa. We reviewed the records of 335 men who were suspected of having unilateral PCa on multi (≥ 12)-core TRUS-guided biopsy and preoperative mpMRI and subsequently had undergone radical prostatectomy (RP) at our institution. Based on the analysis of pathologic outcomes from RP, the performance of the combinatory approach in predicting the pathological laterality of PCa was evaluated. Pathology was classified to be unfavorable when showing a Gleason pattern of 4/5 or pT3/N1 features. Significant cancer was defined as non-organ-confined disease, having a Gleason pattern of 4/5, or showing a cancer volume of ≥ 0.5 mL. Among the 335 unilateral lobes not suspected to harbor tumor from either the TRUS biopsy or mpMRI, the actual absence rate of malignancy was only 13.7% from a pathologic analysis of RP specimens. Even among the 115 D'Amico low-risk group, the absence rate of malignancy was only 26.1% in unilateral lobes not suspected to harbor tumor. Among the 335 lobes, unfavorable pathology and significant cancer were not observed in 36.1% and 30.7%, respectively. The absence rates of unfavorable pathology and significant cancer among the D'Amico low risk group were 56.5% and 47.8%, respectively.

This study aimed to investigate the value, sensitivity and specificity of the PCPT-RC 2.0 in assessing the risk of PCa in the Chinese high-risk population.  Methods:   This study included 622 patients with the high risk of PCa characterized by high serum PSA (PSA >3 μg/L) or abnormality in digital rectal examination or imaging of the prostate. According to the results of prostate biopsy, we divided the patients into a PCa and a non-PCa group and used the PCPT-RC 2.0 for evaluation of all the cases followed by statistical analysis.  Results:   PCa was detected in 264 (42.4%) of the 622 patients, including 126 cases of high-grade malignancy. Compared with the non-PCa group, the PCa patients showed a significantly older age (［68.40 ± 7.30］ vs ［72.80 ± 7.20］ yr, P <0.001), higher serum PSA level (［11.20 ± 7.76］ vs ［15.06 ± 10.65］, P <0.001), and higher PCPT risk score (［37.0 ± 10.8］% vs ［44.4 ± 12.6］%, P <0.001). The PCPT risk score exhibited a greater area under the ROC curve than the level of serum PSA in evaluating the risk of PCa (0.67 vs 0.61, P <0.05), but no statistically significant difference between the two in predicting the risk of high-grade malignancy (0.67 vs 0.66, P >0.05).  Conclusions:   The PCPT risk score is valuable in predicting the risk of PCa in China, which may play a better role than the serum PSA level in screening PCa and avoid unnecessary prostate biopsy, though its advantage is not so obvious in identifying high-grade malignancy.

Here, we report that SRRM4 in castrate-resistant tumors is highly expressed in NEPC, strongly correlated with SYP, CD56, and CHGA expressions (Pearson correlation r = 0.883, 0.675, and 0.881; P < 0.0001) and negatively correlated with AR and PSA expressions (Pearson correlation r = -0.544 and -0.310; P < 0.05). Overall survival is 12.3 months for patients with SRRM4 positive tumors, comparing to 23 months for patients with SRRM4 negative tumors. In treatment-naïve AdPC, low SRRM4 expression is detected in ∼16% tumor cores. It correlates with SYP and CHGA expressions, but not Gleason scores. AdPC treated with >7 month NHT has significantly higher SRRM4 expression. Based on these findings, we conclude that SRRM4 expression in castrate-resistant tumors is highly correlated with NEPC and poor patient survival. It may serve as a diagnosis and prognosis biomarker of NEPC.""","""['Yinan Li', 'Qingfu Zhang', 'Jessica Lovnicki', 'Ruiqi Chen', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Martin Gleave', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Xuesen Dong']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['SRRM4 Expression and the Loss of REST Activity May Promote the Emergence of the Neuroendocrine Phenotype in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'SRRM4 Drives Neuroendocrine Transdifferentiation of Prostate Adenocarcinoma Under Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibition.', 'A novel mechanism of SRRM4 in promoting neuroendocrine prostate cancer development via a pluripotency gene network.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer (NEPC) progressing from conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma: factors associated with time to development of NEPC and survival from NEPC diagnosis-a systematic review and pooled analysis.', 'Exon definitive regions for MPC1 microexon splicing and its usage for splicing modulation.', 'An antisense amido-bridged nucleic acid gapmer oligonucleotide targeting SRRM4 alters REST splicing and exhibits anti-tumor effects in small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer cells.', 'CRISPR screens reveal genetic determinants of PARP inhibitor sensitivity and resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Lin28 Regulates Cancer Cell Stemness for Tumour Progression.', 'Aggressive variants of prostate cancer: underlying mechanisms of neuroendocrine transdifferentiation.']"""

Because of increasing experience and dexterity of the operating team, we hypothesize that patients with known risk factors nowadays have a better survival of their prosthesis. However, due to a change to a more complex case mix, overall results appear to be worse.  Materials and methods:   All men who underwent implantation of an AUS between 2001 and 2016 because of urethral sphincter deficiency were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided in groups based on date of surgery and number of patients: 2001-2009 (G1), 2010-2013 (G2), 2014-2016 (G3). Baseline characteristics and additional therapies prior to implantation were analyzed in all groups. Risk factors for failure only in G1 and G2. Revision or explantation of the AUS was used as endpoint. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate survival of the device.  Results:   A total of 129 patients (mean age 72 ± 9 years) underwent 129 primary implants, and 11 secondary implants. Median follow-up was 5.74 years in G1, 3.26 years G2 and 1.54 years G3. Approximately 25% of the patients in G1 had received adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer and 14% underwent previous surgery for incontinence. In G2, 51 and 55% underwent adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer and previous surgery for incontinence, respectively, G3 was comparable. The overall 50% survival improved in patients with radiotherapy and previous incontinence surgery in G2 as compared to G1.  Conclusions:   Despite the more complex patient population, the survival of the AUS did not decrease. In some patient categories, the AUS functional survival is even still improving over the past few years.""","""['M J Te Dorsthorst', 'M J van der Doelen', 'F Farag', 'F M J Martens', 'J P F A Heesakkers']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Comparison of adjustable male slings and artificial urinary sphincter in the treatment of male urinary incontinence: a retrospective analysis of patient selection and postoperative continence status.', 'Risk Factors for Failure of Male Slings and Artificial Urinary Sphincters: Results from a Large Middle European Cohort Study.', 'Complications and Interventions in Patients with an Artificial Urinary Sphincter: Long-Term Results.', 'Management of urethral atrophy after implantation of artificial urinary sphincter: what are the weaknesses?', 'Operative therapy for stress urinary incontinence in men--from sling to artificial sphincter.', 'Urethral atrophy is now a rare cause for artificial urinary sphincter revision surgery in the contemporary 3.5 cm cuff era.']"""

Moreover, we conducted gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in prostate cancer cell to explore the biological function and molecular mechanism of TINCR.  Results:   In our results, low-expression TINCR was observed in prostate cancer, and correlated with advanced clinical T stage, lymph node involvement, distant metastasis, high Gleason score and poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. Moreover, levels of TINCR expression were negatively associated with TRIP13 mRNA and protein expressions in prostate cancer tissues, and negatively regulated the TRIP13 mRNA and protein expressions in prostate cancer cell lines.

Here, we show that depletion of the cytoskeletal regulator, Diaphanous-related formin 3 (DIAPH3), or the nuclear membrane-associated proteins, lamin A/C, in prostate and breast cancer cells, induces nuclear shape instability, with a corresponding gain in malignant properties, including secretion of extracellular vesicles that contain genomic material. This transformation is characterized by a reduction and/or mislocalization of the inner nuclear membrane protein, emerin. Consistent with this, depletion of emerin evokes nuclear shape instability and promotes metastasis. By visualizing emerin localization, evidence for nuclear shape instability was observed in cultured tumor cells, in experimental models of prostate cancer, in human prostate cancer tissues, and in circulating tumor cells from patients with metastatic disease. Quantitation of emerin mislocalization discriminated cancer from benign tissue and correlated with disease progression in a prostate cancer cohort. Taken together, these results identify emerin as a mediator of nuclear shape stability in cancer and show that destabilization of emerin can promote metastasis.Significance: This study identifies a novel mechanism integrating the control of nuclear structure with the metastatic phenotype, and our inclusion of two types of human specimens (cancer tissues and circulating tumor cells) demonstrates direct relevance to human cancer.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/21/6086/F1.large.jpg Cancer Res; 78(21); 6086-97. ©2018 AACR.""","""['Mariana Reis-Sobreiro', 'Jie-Fu Chen', 'Tatiana Novitskaya', 'Sungyong You', 'Samantha Morley', 'Kenneth Steadman', 'Navjot Kaur Gill', 'Adel Eskaros', 'Mirja Rotinen', 'Chia-Yi Chu', 'Leland W K Chung', 'Hisashi Tanaka', 'Wei Yang', 'Beatrice S Knudsen', 'Hsian-Rong Tseng', 'Amy C Rowat', 'Edwin M Posadas', 'Andries Zijlstra', 'Dolores Di Vizio', 'Michael R Freeman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Defects in Emerin-Nucleoskeleton Binding Disrupt Nuclear Structure and Promote Breast Cancer Cell Motility and Metastasis.', 'Nuclear envelope structural proteins facilitate nuclear shape changes accompanying embryonic differentiation and fidelity of gene expression.', 'Lamin A/C and Emerin depletion impacts chromatin organization and dynamics in the interphase nucleus.', 'The Role of Emerin in Cancer Progression and Metastasis.', 'The nuclear envelope LEM-domain protein emerin.', 'The nuclear envelope and metastasis.', 'Tuning between Nuclear Organization and Functionality in Health and Disease.', 'Context-specific regulation of extracellular vesicle biogenesis and cargo selection.', 'Nuclear envelope, chromatin organizers, histones, and DNA: The many achilles heels exploited across cancers.', 'Tumor-Derived Extracellular Vesicles: Multifunctional Entities in the Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Thus, to our knowledge the natural history of androgen deprivation treatment naïve favorable and unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer cases remains unknown.  Materials and methods:   Groups at 3 academic centers pooled data on patients with intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with radical monotherapy (dose escalated external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy or radical prostatectomy) without combined androgen deprivation treatment. We used the cumulative incidence with competing risk analysis to estimate biochemical recurrence, distant metastasis and prostate cancer specific mortality.  Results:   A total of 2,550 men at intermediate risk were included in study, of whom 1,063 and 1,487 were at favorable and unfavorable risk, respectively. Of the men 1,149 underwent radical prostatectomy, 1,143 underwent dose escalated external beam radiotherapy and 258 underwent brachytherapy. Median followup after the different treatments ranged from 60.4 to 107.4 months. The 10-year cumulative incidence of distant metastasis in the favorable vs unfavorable risk groups was 0.2% (95% CI 0.2-0.2) vs 11.6% (95% CI 7.7-15.5) for radical prostatectomy (p <0.001), 2.8% (95% CI 0.8-4.8) vs 13.5% (95% CI 9.6-17.4) for dose escalated external beam radiotherapy (p <0.001) and 3.5% (95% CI 0-7.4) vs 10.2% (95% CI 4.3-16.1) for brachytherapy (p = 0.063).

Although techniques have been previously introduced to delineate lesions from mpMRI, these techniques were evaluated in datasets with T2 maps available. The generation of T2 map is not included in the clinical prostate mpMRI consensus guidelines; the acquisition of which requires repeated T2-weighted (T2W) scans and would significantly lengthen the scan time currently required for the clinically recommended acquisition protocol, which includes T2W, diffusion-weighted (DW), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an algorithm that provides pixel-accurate lesion delineation from images acquired based on the clinical protocol.  Methods:   Twenty-five pixel-based features were extracted from the T2-weighted (T2W), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) images. The pixel-wise classification was performed on the reduced space generated by locality alignment discriminant analysis (LADA), a version of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) localized to patches in the feature space. Postprocessing procedures, including the removal of isolated points identified and filling of holes inside detected regions, were performed to improve delineation accuracy. The segmentation result was evaluated against the lesions manually delineated by four expert observers according to the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) detection guideline.  Results:   The LADA-based classifier (60 ± 11%) achieved a higher sensitivity than the LDA-based classifier (51 ± 10%), thereby demonstrating, for the first time, that higher classification performance was attained on the reduced space generated by LADA than by LDA. Further sensitivity improvement (75 ± 14%) was obtained after postprocessing, approaching the sensitivities attained by previous mpMRI lesion delineation studies in which nonclinical T2 maps were available.  Conclusion:   The proposed algorithm delineated lesions accurately and efficiently from images acquired following the clinical protocol. The development of this framework may potentially accelerate the clinical uses of mpMRI in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.""","""['Mingquan Lin', 'Weifu Chen', 'Mingbo Zhao', 'Eli Gibson', 'Matthew Bastian-Jordan', 'Derek W Cool', 'Zahra Kassam', 'Huageng Liang', 'Tommy W S Chow', 'Aaron D Ward', 'Bernard Chiu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A self-tuned graph-based framework for localization and grading prostate cancer lesions: An initial evaluation based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Implementation of a 5-Minute Magnetic Resonance Imaging Screening Protocol for Prostate Cancer in Men With Elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen Before Biopsy.', 'Automatic stratification of prostate tumour aggressiveness using multiparametric MRI: a horizontal comparison of texture features.', 'Prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2 (PI-RADS v2): a pictorial review.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Artificial intelligence in tumor subregion analysis based on medical imaging: A review.']"""

C-terminal binding protein 1 (CTBP1) is a transcriptional co-repressor of tumor suppressor genes that is activated by low NAD+ /NADH ratio. Previously, our group established a MeS and PCa mice model that identified CTBP1 as a novel link associating both diseases. We found that CTBP1 controls the transcription of aromatase (CYP19A1), a key enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens. The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanism that explains CTBP1 as a link between MeS and PCa based on CYP19A1 and estrogen synthesis regulation using PCa cell lines, MeS/PCa mice and adipose co-culture systems. We found that CTBP1 and E1A binding protein p300 (EP300) bind to CYP19A1 promoter and downregulate its expression in PC3 cells. Estradiol, through estrogen receptor beta, released CTBP1 from CYP19A1 promoter triggering its transcription and modulating PCa cell proliferation. We generated NSG and C57BL/6J MeS mice by chronically feeding animals with high fat diet. In the NSG model, CTBP1 depleted PCa xenografts showed an increase in CYP19A1 expression with subsequent increment in intratumor estradiol concentrations. Additionally, in C57BL/6J mice, MeS induced hypertrophy, hyperplasia and inflammation of the white adipose tissue, which leads to a proinflammatory phenotype and increased serum estradiol concentration. Thus, MeS increased PCa growth and Ctbp1, Fabp4 and IL-6 expression levels. These results describe, for the first time, a novel CTBP1/CYP19A1/Estradiol axis that explains, in part, the mechanism for prostate tumor growth increase by MeS.""","""['Cintia Massillo', 'Guillermo Nicolás Dalton', 'Juliana Porretti', 'Georgina Daniela Scalise', 'Paula Lucía Farré', 'Flavia Piccioni', 'Florencia Secchiari', 'Natalia Pascuali', 'Colin Clyne', 'Kevin Gardner', 'Paola De Luca', 'Adriana De Siervi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['CLCA2 epigenetic regulation by CTBP1, HDACs, ZEB1, EP300 and miR-196b-5p impacts prostate cancer cell adhesion and EMT in metabolic syndrome disease.', 'CTBP1 depletion on prostate tumors deregulates miRNA/mRNA expression and impairs cancer progression in metabolic syndrome mice.', 'Prostate tumor growth is impaired by CtBP1 depletion in high-fat diet-fed mice.', 'Transcriptional control of local estrogen formation by aromatase in the breast.', 'The Role of CtBP1 in Oncogenic Processes and Its Potential as a Therapeutic Target.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Role of adipocyte browning in prostate and breast tumor microenvironment.', 'Hsa-miR-133a-3p, miR-1-3p, GOLPH3 and JUP combination results in a good biomarker to distinguish between prostate cancer and non-prostate cancer patients.', 'Interplay between Prostate Cancer and Adipose Microenvironment: A Complex and Flexible Scenario.', 'Lipid metabolism-related lncRNA SLC25A21-AS1 promotes the progression of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma by regulating the NPM1/c-Myc axis and SLC25A21 expression.']"""

Methods:   Monte Carlo (MC) calculated, inversely optimized KVAT plans of spherical, idealized breast, lung, and prostate lesions were calculated using the EGSnrc/BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc MC codes. The dose delivered with the KVAT system, which generates 200-225 kV photon beamlets, was calculated and inversely optimized using an optimization framework developed at McGill University. KVAT dose distributions were compared with inversely optimized and MC generated megavoltage (MV) volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans as a reference. Prescription doses delivered to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) were 38.5 (10 fractions), 60 (30 fractions) and 73.8 (41 fractions) Gy for the breast, lung and prostate patients, respectively. Dose distributions, dose volume histograms, and PTV homogeneity indices were used to evaluate KVAT and VMAT plans based on RTOG protocols.  Results:   All organ-at-risk (OAR) doses were within prescribed dose limits for KVAT and VMAT plans. Generally, KVAT plans delivered higher doses to OARs. For example, due to the lower energy of KVAT, 50% of the rib volume received 12.9 Gy from KVAT while only receiving 2.5 Gy from VMAT. OAR doses were especially high for the KVAT prostate plan due to the presence of large volumes of bony anatomy, which illustrates a limitation of the KVAT system. The KVAT treatment times per fraction for the breast, lung and prostate patients were 2.8, 2.6 and 5.5 min, respectively.

Data on the use of 68 Ga-PSMA PET scans in the setting of biochemical recurrence is widely available. Data on the use of 68 Ga-PSMA PET as an initial staging modality, however, is limited. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the staging of patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer between 68 Ga-PSMA PET and current conventional imaging modalities. The potential impact of any change in stage will be analysed.  Methods:   Details of all patients who underwent 68 Ga-PSMA PET in South Australia between March 2016 and March 2017 were obtained. One hundred and thirty-one patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who had 68 Ga-PSMA PET prior to consideration of definitive treatment were included in this study. The stage pre-68 Ga-PSMA PET (based on conventional imaging) and post-68 Ga-PSMA PET was recorded. The stage was classified as A - localised disease, B - presence of regional lymphadenopathy, C - oligometastatic disease (up to three metastases) and D - widespread metastases. Management plans were recorded.  Results:   This study showed that the use of 68 Ga-PSMA PET resulted in a change of stage in 37 (28%) patients with an upstage in 17 (13%) patients and a downstage in 20 (15%) patients (P < 0.001). 68 Ga-PSMA PET excluded oligometastatic disease in 11 (8%) patients who had suspicious oligometastatic disease based on a single conventional imaging modality. These 68 Ga-PSMA PET findings impacted on management in at least 24 (18%) patients.  Conclusion:   The use of 68 Ga-PSMA PET scans in initial staging can have a significant impact on staging and management when compared to current conventional imaging modalities.""","""['Hui Sze Wong', 'John Leung', 'Dylan Bartholomeusz', 'Peter Sutherland', 'Hien Le', 'Michelle Nottage', 'Ivan Iankov', 'Joe H Chang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET staging on clinical decision-making in patients with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Gallium-68 Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Advanced Prostate Cancer-Updated Diagnostic Utility, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Distribution of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-avid Lesions: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Sensitivity, Specificity, and Predictors of Positive 68Ga-Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', '68Ga-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) for primary staging of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Defining Oligometastatic Disease in the New Era of PSMA-PET Imaging for Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Imaging in Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer Patients: Current Aspects and Future Trends.', '68Ga-Prostate-specific membrane antigen (psma) positron emission tomography (pet) in prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Direct comparison of 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Impact of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET staging on clinical decision-making in patients with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   The Japan Study Group of Prostate Cancer compiled a nationwide community-based database on prostate cancer patients who underwent ADT. That database included 13 774 patients who were started on ADT by surgical or medical castration alone (monotherapy group, 5395 cases) or ADT in combination with a nonsteroidal anti-androgen (combined androgen blockade (CAB) group, 8379 cases). We used logistic regression analysis with background factors as independent factors to calculate propensity scores in regard to selection of CAB. Next, for 8826 cases of propensity score-matched patients, we compared the survival rates in the two groups.  Results:   The CAB group showed a significantly better progression-free survival (PFS) rate (65.6% vs 59.6% at 5 years; median time to progression, 11.6 vs 7.1 years; hazard ratio in the CAB group: 0.78, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.72 to 0.84; P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis based on the background factors, the PFS rate was generally better in the CAB group in all risk subgroups except for those having significant risk factors.

Inflammation of the salivary glands and consequent reduced salivary function have been reported in patients after radioiodine therapy. The beneficial effects of sialendoscopy on radiation-induced inflammation in tissue are well known. Thus sialendoscopy with dilatation, saline irrigation and steroid injections (prednisolone) was performed before and after 225Ac-PSMA-617 TAT to reduce inflammatory effects in the salivary glands and to improve or prevent xerostomia.  Methods:   Eleven men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mean age 68.5 years, range 58-80 years) underwent sialendoscopy, dilatation, saline irrigation and steroid injection of both submandibular and both parotid glands before or after every cycle of 225Ac-PSMA-617 TAT. Sialendoscopy and steroid injection were performed by a senior ENT physician. Quality of life was evaluated using two health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires, the Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ) and the Xerostomia Inventory (XI) before and 3 months after the intervention.  Results:   In all 11 patients both parotid and both submandibular glands were affected by radiation sialadenitis and sialendoscopy was performed. The patients experienced no complications after sialendoscopy, and showed a significant improvement in HRQOL as measured using the XQ and XI. After sialendoscopy the XQ score decreased significantly from 77.7 ± 13.6 to 42.7 ± 14.8 (p = 0.003) and the XI score decreased from 44.5 ± 6.9 to 25.8 ± 12.8 (p = 0.003). Due to the limited number of patients we only report tendencies.  Conclusion:   Sialendoscopy with dilatation, saline irrigation and steroid injection had beneficial effects on salivary gland function and HRQOL in patients undergoing 225Ac-PSMA-617 RLT. However, even with sialadenoscopic support after multiple cycles of TAT, salivary gland function was reduced and xerostomia was present. Therefore, not only inflammation but also the direct effect of radiation is a putative cause of dry mouth.

During this experiment, monomers of L-lactide, ε-caprolactone, poly(ethylene glycol)-methyl ether, and poly(ethylene glycol)-NH2 were used to prepare pentablock copolymer using the ring opening technique. The pentablock nanomicellar (PBNM) formulation was prepared by the evaporation-rehydration method. The resultant pentablock nanomicelles were then conjugated with PSMA antibody resulting in PSMA-Ab-PTX-PBNM. Both the block copolymers and the nanomicelles were analyzed by hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The obtained nanomicelles (NM) were then analyzed for size and zeta potential using dynamic light scattering-dynamic laser scattering (DLS) and then further submitted to H-NMR and TEM analyses. The XRD, FTIR, and the H-NMR analyses confirmed the structure of the pentablock copolymers. The average size for conjugated nanomicellar was 45 nm ± 2.5 nm. The average (ζ-potential) was around - 28 mV. H-NMR and FTIR analysis done on PSMA-coupled paclitaxel-loaded PBNM showed peaks characteristic of the drug (paclitaxel) and the polymer, confirming the successful encapsulation. TEM analysis showed well-defined spherical morphology and confirmed the size range obtained by the DLS. In vitro release studies revealed sustained slow of PTX in phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Confocal scanning microscopy (TEM) of coumarin6-loaded in PBNM indicated that pentablock nanomicelles were internalized into the prostate cancer (PC-3) cells. Cell proliferation assay showed that nanomicelles ferried paclitaxel into the PC-3 cells and subsequently reduced the cell proliferation.

Methods:   This is a prospective study of 121 patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and conventional imaging (CI) for RPCa. Detection rates were analyzed and correlated with various clinical and biochemical variables such as Gleason score GS), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), trigger PSA (tPSA), PSA doubling-time (PSAdt) and PSA velocity (PSAv).  Results: 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT showed at least one focus of pathological 68Ga-PSMA uptake in 92/121 (76%) of patients. Nodal metastases (in 47% of patients) were the most common site of recurrent disease followed by bones (36%) and prostate (32%). Out of 121 patients, 57 (47%) had only positive findings on PSMA scan verified by biopsy or follow-up. The majority of these lesion were located in the lymph nodes (31/57, 54,5%), which were below the detection limit of CT. Univariate analysis showed higher detection rate of PET/CT with increasing tPSA, PSAv and short PSAdt. Best cutoff for tPSA, PSAv and PSAdt was 0.5 ng/ml, 2.25 ng/ml/year and 8.65 months, respectively.

Cancer patient navigation has been shown to improve access to cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment, but little is known about patient navigation in prostate cancer care.  Methods:   All men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2009 and 2015 were abstracted from the MaineHealth multi-specialty tumor registry. Regression analyses controlling for patient-, disease-, and system-level factors evaluated characteristics associated with navigation utilization. The association between navigation utilization, barriers to care, and longer time to treatment was assessed with Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Of the patient population (n = 1587), 85% of men were navigated. Navigation use was associated with earlier year of diagnosis, treatment by a high-volume urologist, and lower risk disease (p < 0.05). Treatment delay was associated with low-risk disease (vs: intermediate OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46-0.85 and high OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.1-0.25) and receipt of navigation services (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.12-2.45) but not distance to care, insurance, or treatment choice.  Conclusions:   We observed that patients with low-risk prostate cancer were more likely to utilize navigation, but traditional barriers to care were not associated with utilization. Navigation was associated with longer time to treatment, which likely reflects clinically appropriate delays associated with greater shared decision making. Time to treatment may not be the ideal metric for evaluating navigation in prostate cancer; shared decision making, patient satisfaction, and psychosocial outcomes may be more appropriate.""","""['Emily C Serrell', 'Moritz Hansen', 'Greg Mills', 'Andrew Perry', 'Tracy Robbins', 'Melanie Feinberg', 'Scot C Remick', 'Lisa Beaule', 'Matt Hayn', 'Tom Kinkead', 'Paul K J Han', 'Jesse D Sammon']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Satisfaction with Care Among Men with Localised Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Population-based Study.', 'Multiple barriers delay care among women with abnormal cancer screening despite patient navigation.', 'Design of a prostate cancer patient navigation intervention for a Veterans Affairs hospital.', 'The effectiveness of patient navigation programs for adult cancer patients undergoing treatment: a systematic review.', 'Patient barriers to cancer clinical trial participation and navigator activities to assist.', 'Influence of a patient navigation program on timeliness of care in patients with esophageal cancer.', 'Helping Men Find Their Way: Improving Prostate Cancer Clinic Attendance via Patient Navigation.']"""

EMV release is also associated with various pathologies, including cancer, where increased EMV release is amongst other associated with chemo-resistance and active transfer of pro-oncogenic factors. Recent studies show that EMV-inhibiting agents can sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents and reduce cancer growth in vivo. Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid derived from Cannabis sativa, has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, and displays anti-proliferative activity. Here we report a novel role for CBD as a potent inhibitor of EMV release from three cancer cell lines: prostate cancer (PC3), hepatocellular carcinoma (HEPG2) and breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231). CBD significantly reduced exosome release in all three cancer cell lines, and also significantly, albeit more variably, inhibited microvesicle release. The EMV modulating effects of CBD were found to be dose dependent (1 and 5 μM) and cancer cell type specific. Moreover, we provide evidence that this may be associated with changes in mitochondrial function, including modulation of STAT3 and prohibitin expression, and that CBD can be used to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. We suggest that the known anti-cancer effects of CBD may partly be due to the regulatory effects on EMV biogenesis, and thus CBD poses as a novel and safe modulator of EMV-mediated pathological events.""","""['Uchini S Kosgodage', 'Rhys Mould', 'Aine B Henley', 'Alistair V Nunn', 'Geoffrey W Guy', 'E L Thomas', 'Jameel M Inal', 'Jimmy D Bell', 'Sigrun Lange']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Chloramidine/Bisindolylmaleimide-I-Mediated Inhibition of Exosome and Microvesicle Release and Enhanced Efficacy of Cancer Chemotherapy.', 'Peptidylarginine Deiminases-Roles in Cancer and Neurodegeneration and Possible Avenues for Therapeutic Intervention via Modulation of Exosome and Microvesicle (EMV) Release?', 'The emerging role of exosome and microvesicle- (EMV-) based cancer therapeutics and immunotherapy.', 'Cannabidiol Is a Novel Modulator of Bacterial Membrane Vesicles.', 'Cannabidiol Affects Extracellular Vesicle Release, miR21 and miR126, and Reduces Prohibitin Protein in Glioblastoma Multiforme Cells.', 'Should oncologists trust cannabinoids?', 'Beyond Pain Relief: A Review on Cannabidiol Potential in Medical Therapies.', 'Cannabidiol for musculoskeletal regenerative medicine.', 'Extracellular Vesicles in Breast Cancer: From Biology and Function to Clinical Diagnosis and Therapeutic Management.', 'An update\xa0in the applications of exosomes in cancer theranostics: from research to clinical trials.']"""

These results emphasize that genomic and gene expression features of the ERG-negative group may provide a reference for populations with lower ERG fusion frequency. While the overall expression patterns were comparable between ERG-negative and ERG-positive tumors, we found that genomic alterations could affect the same pathway through distinct genes in the same pathway in both groups of tumor types.

Among the 12,391 vitiligo patients (5364 males and 7027 females) and 48,531.09 person-years of observation, a total of 345 cancers were identified. Significantly increased SIRs were observed for prostate cancer in male patients, thyroid cancer and breast cancer in female patients and bladder cancers in both male and female patients. Unfortunately, the low incidence rate of certain cancers limited the power of our statistical analyses. This study demonstrated the patterns of malignancies in vitiligo patients of Taiwan.

No previous studies have compared health-related quality of life in thyroid cancer survivors to United States normative data and patient-reported outcomes from other types of cancers. We hypothesized that thyroid cancer survivors would report health-related quality of life poorer than the general United States population but similar to individuals with other cancers.  Methods:   Thyroid cancer survivors were recruited online January2017-June 2017. Individuals completed a two-part questionnaire to assess clinical characteristics and health-related quality of life, using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-item profile. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System T-scores obtained from the literature were compared with United States normative data and T-scores from patients with breast, prostate, uterine, cervical, colorectal, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and lung cancers.  Results:   A total of 1,743 US respondents completed the survey. Thyroid cancer survivors reported statistically significantly worse health-related quality of life across all seven Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System domains compared with United States normative data (P < .05). Surveyed individuals reported statistically significantly worse scores for anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance than respondents from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast, colorectal, uterine, and prostate cancer cohorts (P < .01) but less pain and greater physical functioning than most other groups in this comparison (P < .01).  Conclusion:   The importance of health-related quality of life among thyroid cancer survivors should not be obscured by the relatively high survival rate of thyroid cancer compared with other cancers. Our results demonstrate that thyroid cancer survivors may be encumbered with greater psychologic and social burdens than survivors of several cancers that have a worse prognosis.""","""['Sneha Goswami', 'Michael Mongelli', 'Benjamin J Peipert', 'Irene Helenowski', 'Susan E Yount', 'Cord Sturgeon']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Surgery""","""['Re: Quality of life and symptom impact of thyroid cancer: A cross-sectional survey of Canadian patients.', 'Financial burden and quality of life among thyroid cancer survivors.', 'Clinical factors associated with worse quality-of-life scores in United\xa0States thyroid cancer survivors.', 'Age-related differences in health-related quality of life among thyroid cancer survivors compared with a normative sample: Results from the PROFILES Registry.', 'Quality of Life in Thyroid Cancer is Similar to That of Other Cancers with Worse Survival.', 'A Systematic Review of Unmet Information and Psychosocial Support Needs of Adults Diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer.', 'The ""not so good"" thyroid cancer: a scoping review on risk factors associated with anxiety, depression and quality of life.', 'Review: Improving quality of life in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.', 'Current patterns of care in low-risk thyroid cancer-A national cross-sectional survey of Australian thyroid clinicians.', 'Saliva microbiome changes in thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules patients.', 'Mental Health in Postoperative Thyroid Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic.']"""

Material and methods:   A total of 710 patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), which was evaluated in accordance with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS). The maximum PI-RADS (maxPI-RADS) was defined as the highest PI-RADS of all lesions detected in mpMRI. In case of proven prostate cancer (PCa) and performed RP, tumour grading of the biopsy specimen was compared to that of the RP. Significant PCa (csPCa) was defined according to Epstein criteria.  Results:   Overall, scPCa was detected in 40% of patients. The detection rate of scPCa was 33% for fusPbx and 25% for sysPbx alone (p < 0.005). Patients with a maxPI-RADS ≥3 and a prostate specific antigen (PSA)-density ≥0.2 ng/mL2 harboured more csPCa than those with a PSA-density < 0.2 ng/mL2 (41% [33/81] vs. 20% [48/248]; p < 0.001).

We previously reported that downregulation of the proapoptotic protein Par-4 promotes tumor recurrence in genetically engineered mouse models of breast cancer recurrence. In the present study, we examined the mechanism and functional significance of Par-4 downregulation in recurrent tumors. We found that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promotes epigenetic silencing of Par-4 in recurrent tumors. Par-4 silencing proceeded through binding of the EMT transcription factor Twist to the Par-4 promoter, where Twist induced a unique bivalent chromatin domain. This bivalent configuration conferred plasticity at the Par-4 promoter, and Par-4 silencing could be reversed with pharmacologic inhibitors of Ezh2 and HDAC1/2. Using an epigenome editing approach to reexpress Par-4 by specifically reversing the histone modifications found in recurrent tumors, we found that Par-4 reexpression sensitized recurrent tumors to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Upon reexpression, Par-4 bound to the protein phosphatase PP1, caused widespread changes in phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, and cooperated with microtubule-targeting drugs to induce mitotic defects. These results identify Twist-induced epigenetic silencing of Par-4 as a targetable axis that promotes chemoresistance in recurrent breast cancer.""","""['Nathaniel W Mabe', 'Douglas B Fox', 'Ryan Lupo', 'Amy E Decker', 'Stephanie N Phelps', 'J Will Thompson', 'James V Alvarez']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['MIER3 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promotes breast cancer cell aggressiveness via forming a co-repressor complex with HDAC1/HDAC2/Snail.', 'Twist contributes to hormone resistance in breast cancer by downregulating estrogen receptor-α.', 'Twist promotes tumor metastasis in basal-like breast cancer by transcriptionally upregulating ROR1.', 'Nanoparticle Delivery of TWIST Small Interfering RNA and Anticancer Drugs: A Therapeutic Approach for Combating Cancer.', 'Tumor microenvironment promotes breast cancer chemoresistance.', 'Anticancer genes (NOXA, PAR-4, TRAIL) are de-regulated in breast cancer patients and can be targeted by using a ribosomal inactivating plant protein (riproximin).', 'Curcumin Sensitizes 4T1 Murine Breast Cancer Cells to Cisplatin Through PAR4 Secretion.', 'Classical epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and alternative cell death process-driven blebbishield metastatic-witch (BMW) pathways to cancer metastasis.', 'UACA locus is associated with breast cancer chemoresistance and survival.', 'Identification of Key Transcription Factors and Immune Infiltration Patterns Associated With Breast Cancer Prognosis Using WGCNA and Cox Regression Analysis.']"""

However, a lack of understanding of the mechanism underlying PCa metastasis has strongly limited the effectiveness of therapy for this disease. Thus, investigating the mechanism of PCa may help improve the prognosis of PCa patients. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of microRNA-194 (miR-194) in PCa.  Materials and methods:   The expression of miR-194 and cadherin 2 (CDH2) at the transcriptional level was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The MTT assay cell apoptosis assay and Western blotting were used to determine the role of miR-194 and CDH2 in the PC3 human PCa cell line. The dual luciferase reporter assay system was performed to clarify the relationship between miR-194 and CDH2. qRT-PCR results showed that miR-194 was downregulated and CDH2 was upregulated in PC3 cells.  Results:   Transfection with miR-194 mimics decreased cell viability and increased the rate of apoptosis compared with the control group of PC3 cells. Bioinformatics and the luciferase reporter assay indicated that CDH2 was a target of miR-194, and Western blot analysis suggested that CDH2 was negatively regulated by miR-194. Further studies revealed that the downregulation of CDH2 suppressed cell viability and promoted the apoptosis of PC3 cells and that miR-194 directly targeted CDH2 in PC3 cells. Finally, the in vivo experiments showed that miR-194 mimics suppressed tumor growth and induced apoptosis in a greater proportion of cells by decreasing the expression of CDH2 compared with the control group.  Conclusion:   The results of this study showed that miR-194 targeted CDH2 to regulate PCa cell survival in vitro and suppress tumor growth in vivo. These findings suggest that miR-194 may be a useful therapeutic target in PCa.""","""['Song Gao', 'Zhiying Zhao', 'Rong Wu', 'Lina Wu', 'Xin Tian', 'Zhenyong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['MicroRNA-223-3p regulates cell chemo-sensitivity by targeting FOXO3 in prostatic cancer.', 'TERF1 downregulation promotes the migration and invasion of the PC3 prostate cancer cell line as a target of miR‑155.', 'Long non-coding RNA TTN-AS1 promotes cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis in prostatic cancer by sponging miR-193a-5p.', 'MiR-219-5p inhibits prostate cancer cell growth and metastasis by targeting HMGA2.', 'MicroRNA-124 Functions as a Tumor Suppressor by Regulating CDH2 and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'hsa_circ_0000285 facilitates thyroid cancer progression by regulating miR-127-5p/CDH2.', 'Small interfering RNA targeting N-cadherin regulates cell proliferation and migration in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Identification and verification of the molecular mechanisms and prognostic values of the cadherin gene family in gastric cancer.', 'MiR-145 suppresses the motility of prostate cancer cells by targeting cadherin-2.']"""

In the last few years, several PSMA-specific ligands have been developed, that can be successfully used to detect primary prostate cancer, tumor recurrences and metastases as well.  Aim:   The goal of our work was to examine the clinical application of a 99mtechnetium-labeled PSMA-radiopharmaceutical as part of the routine diagnostics of prostate cancer.  Method:   We examined 15 male patients with verified prostate adenocarcinoma with suspicion of progression or recurrence of the disease. We performed whole-body PSMA-SPECT/CTs and multiparametric MRIs of the prostate and the pelvic regions within a week. We used 99mTc-mas3-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE) for the PSMA-SPECT scans. The images were visually evaluated by independent observers. The results were compared with the follow-up bone scintigraphies as well.  Results:   Twenty-two PSMA-positive lesions were found. Nine of them were localized outside, 13 were within the MRI's field of view. From these 13 lesions, 7 matched with the SPECT/CT results and in 5 cases the MRI images showed no abnormalities. In one case, bone metastasis was suspected on the MRI scan but there was no corresponding pathological tracer uptake on the SPECT images. In two patients, none of the examinations showed signs of prostate malignancy. Four patients had PSMA-positive bone metastases. One of them had a matching PSMA/SPECT and bone scintigraphy result and in one case the PSMA examination showed metastasis in contrast to the negative bone scintigraphy.  Conclusion:   PSMA-SPECT/CT with 99mTc-mas3-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE) is a promising diagnostic tool. This technique is capable of visualizing bone metastases and it can detect local recurrences and visceral metastases as well.

Methods:   The clinical data of 6,948 patients who were examined for ProGRP from February 2015 to January 2017 in the Zhongshan Hospital of the XiaMen University, were collected. The clinical data of the different groups were analyzed by statistical methods.  Results:   The ProGRP reference levels were 68.50 pg/mL. The percentages of abnormal ProGRP levels were 23.87%, 26.14%, 22.87%, 84.56%, 16.1%, 15.59% and 43.75% for the pneumonia, cardiovascular disease, cerebral vascular disease, renal failure, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer groups, respectively. The 95th percentile of the serum ProGRP concentration levels in the renal failure group was 364.22 pg/mL. The ProGRP cutoff levels for SCLC group were 162.90 pg/mL and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.940 (95% CI, 0.892 to 0.987). The parameters sensitivity, specificity, PLR (positive likelihood ratio), NLR (negative likelihood) and Kappa value for the SCLC group with the exclusion of the renal failure group were 81.10% (95% CI: 38.19% - 89.71%), 99.51% (95% CI: 99.31% - 99.66%), 167.59 (95% CI: 116.06 - 241.99), 0.19 (95% CI: 0.11 - 0.32), and 0.6830 (Sig: 0.000), respectively. In the SCLC group, significantly higher concentrations of serum ProGRP of M1 were observed compared with M0. All esophageal neoplasms with high-level ProGRP were identified as small cell neoplasms.  Conclusions:   The ProGRP levels were increased in a variety of benign and malignant diseases and were considered a putative marker for SCLC with the exception of the renal failure group. It may be suggested that the high ProGRP levels originated from patients with neuroendocrine tumor.""","""['Lili Fang', 'Zhongqiang Huang', 'Yongzhi Lin', 'Jianguo Fu', 'Xianming Liang', 'Fan Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Lab""","""['Plasma proGRP concentration is sensitive and specific for discriminating small cell lung cancer from nonmalignant conditions or non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Diagnostic and therapeutic value of progastrin-releasing peptide on small-cell lung cancer: A Single-Center Experience in China.', 'Establishment of cut-off value of serum pro-gastrin-releasing peptide for diagnosis of small cell lung cancer and evaluation on the clinical diagnosis efficiency.', 'ProGRP: a new biomarker for small cell lung cancer.', 'Diagnostic value of tumor marker pro-gastrin-releasing peptide in patients with small cell lung cancer: a systematic review.', 'Pro-Gastrin-Releasing Peptide as a Biomarker in Lung Neuroendocrine Neoplasm.', 'Plasma progastrin-releasing peptide level shows different predictive profiles for treatment response by androgen receptor axis-targeted agents in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic value of tumor markers in identifying favorable or unfavorable subsets in patients with cancer of unknown primary: a retrospective study.']"""

Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2010-2014), we identified 58 974 African Americans or non-Hispanic whites with prostate cancer, who underwent radical prostatectomy with available clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen and biopsy Gleason score. Annual trends were examined. Logistic regression models focused on lymph node dissection rates, lymph node dissection extent (number of removed lymph nodes) and lymph node invasion. Cox regression models tested for differences in cancer-specific mortality. Multivariable models were adjusted for D'Amico risk groups, age and year. Models predicting lymph node invasion and cancer-specific mortality were additionally adjusted for lymph node dissection extent.  Results:   Among all patients, 14.5% were African Americans. Lymph node dissection was carried out in 60.0% of African Americans versus 59.5% of non-Hispanic whites (P = 0.4). The median number of removed lymph nodes was five in African Americans versus six in non-Hispanic whites (P < 0.001). Furthermore, 3.1% versus 3.3% of African Americans and non-Hispanic whites, respectively, harbored lymph node invasion (P = 0.3). In multivariable logistic regression models African American race did not affect lymph node dissection or lymph node invasion rates, but lymph node dissection extent was lower in African Americans (hazard ratio 0.9; P < 0.001). No statistical differences in cancer-specific mortality were identified according to race.  Conclusions:   Contemporary North American African American patients treated with radical prostatectomy have equal access to lymph node dissection, the same lymph node invasion rates and the same cancer-specific mortality rates as non-Hispanic whites. However, the extent of lymph node dissection is lower in African Americans. The results regarding lymph node dissection rates are encouraging. However, improvements are required regarding lymph node dissection extent in African Americans.""","""['Felix Preisser', 'Sebastiano Nazzani', 'Marco Bandini', 'Michele Marchioni', 'Zhe Tian', 'Fred Saad', 'Felix Kh Chun', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen', 'Derya Tilki', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment to Racial disparities in lymph node dissection at radical prostatectomy: A Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database analysis.', 'Racial Differences in the Surgical Care of Medicare Beneficiaries With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Extent of lymph node dissection improves survival in prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy without lymph node invasion.', 'Risk of lymph node metastases in pathological gleason score≤6 prostate adenocarcinoma: Analysis of institutional and population-based databases.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Racial disparity in clinical course and outcome of metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'The effect of race/ethnicity on cancer-specific mortality after salvage radical prostatectomy.']"""
