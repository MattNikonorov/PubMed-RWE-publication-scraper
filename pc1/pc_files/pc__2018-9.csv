However, it is a challenging task due to: 1) low soft tissue contrast in CT images and 2) large shape and appearance variations of pelvic organs. In this paper, we employ a two-stage deep learning-based method, with a novel distinctive curve-guided fully convolutional network (FCN), to solve the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, the first stage is for fast and robust organ detection in the raw CT images. It is designed as a coarse segmentation network to provide region proposals for three pelvic organs. The second stage is for fine segmentation of each organ, based on the region proposal results. To better identify those indistinguishable pelvic organ boundaries, a novel morphological representation, namely, distinctive curve, is also introduced to help better conduct the precise segmentation. To implement this, in this second stage, a multi-task FCN is initially utilized to learn the distinctive curve and the segmentation map separately and then combine these two tasks to produce accurate segmentation map. The final segmentation results of all three pelvic organs are generated by a weighted max-voting strategy. We have conducted exhaustive experiments on a large and diverse pelvic CT data set for evaluating our proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is accurate and robust for this challenging segmentation task, by also outperforming the state-of-the-art segmentation methods.""","""['Kelei He', 'Xiaohuan Cao', 'Yinghuan Shi', 'Dong Nie', 'Yang Gao', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Pelvic Organ Segmentation Using Distinctive Curve Guided Fully Convolutional Networks.', 'Accurate Segmentation of CT Male Pelvic Organs via Regression-Based Deformable Models and Multi-Task Random Forests.', 'CT male pelvic organ segmentation using fully convolutional networks with boundary sensitive representation.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Automatic segmentation of the female pelvic floor muscles on MRI for pelvic floor function assessment.', 'Deep learning-based segmentation of prostatic urethra on computed tomography scans for treatment planning.', 'Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation Guided by Bi-Directional Constrained Dual-Task Consistency.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Pelvic Cancers Using Deep Learning: State-of-the-Art Approaches and Challenges.', 'COVID-19 Screening in Chest X-Ray Images Using Lung Region Priors.']"""

We examined the predictive value of these systems for an organ-confined disease (pT≤2), favorable WHO-grade ≤2 (Gleason-score ≤7a), and biochemical-free-survival (BFS) after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   Data were collected in a prospective, non-interventional, multicenter health-service-research study for the treatment of localized PCa (HAROW) with 687 patients receiving RP. Mean Follow-up was 31.7 months.  Results:   Organ-confined disease was present in 76.5% and 63.6% of cT1 and cT2 patients, 75.7% and 59.6% of SI and SII, and 84.6%, 81.6%, 72.8% and 42.5% of PSG I, IIA, IIB and ≥ IIC (p = 0.001). Favorable WHO-grade (Gleason-Score) was present in 75.4% and 60.7% of cT1 and cT2 patients, 74.3% and 56.5% of SI and SII patients, and 86.1%,85.6%,73.3% and 29.5% of PSG I, IIA, IIB and ≥ IIC (p = 0.001). Probability of BFS was 92.0% and 91.5% for cT1 and cT2 (p = 0.990), 91.1% and 94.2% for SI and S II (p = 0.286) and 96.6%,95.1%,91.4% and 78.8% for PSG I,IIA,IIB and ≥ IIC (p = 0.001).  Conclusions:   CT 1/cT2 and S I/II subgrouping is feasible to predict a different pT-category and a favorable WHO-grade (Gleason-Score) after RP, but failed to predict a different BFS.

Methods:   This HIPAA-compliant, IRB-approved study included 67 men (median age, 61 years; range, 41-74 years) with biopsy-proven prostate cancer who underwent preoperative 3 T endorectal multiparametric MRI and had ≥1 PZ lesion >0.1 cm3 at whole-mount histopathology. In benign and malignant PZ regions identified from pathology, voxel-based choline/citrate, polyamines/choline, polyamines/creatine, and (choline + polyamines + creatine)/citrate ratios were averaged, as were ADC values. Patients were randomly split into training and test sets; rules for separating benign from malignant regions were generated with classification and regression tree (CART) analysis and assessed on the test set for sensitivity and specificity. Odds ratios (OR) were evaluated using generalized estimating equations.

Previous studies have reported that polymorphisms in caspase genes could lead to poor apoptotic signaling, thus facilitating the onset of several human cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between three polymorphisms (rs1049216, rs2705897 and rs4647603) of the CASP3 gene and the risk of prostate cancer (PCa) in Galicia (NW Spain).The relationship between these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and PCa in European populations has yet to be studied. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a case-control study on a total of 243 patients with PCa and 191 healthy individuals, genotyping all polymorphisms using the matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) method. Overall, none of the polymorphisms were clearly associated with the risk of PCa. Nevertheless, the results drawn from this study suggest that genetic variability in the CASP3 gene, in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors may influence the predisposition to develop PCa in the Galician population. Specifically, the results of study seem to hint at a higher risk of PCa in smokers of up to 20 pack-years (PY) and carriers of both the CASP3-rs1049216 GG genotype and the G allele (OR = 3.61, p = 0.044; OR = 1.71; p = 0.018). In addition, the GG and AG genotypes showed increased predisposition to PCa in overweight individuals (OR = 4.43, p = 0.040; OR = 2.00; p = 0.022). Finally, the CASP3-rs4647603 CT genotype and T allele were associated with a higher susceptibility to PCa in obese individuals (ORCT/TT = 4.30, p = 0.003; ORT/C = 3.58, p = 0.004).

This study aimed to identify the key pathways and genes and find the potential initiation and progression mechanism of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).  Methods:   We downloaded the gene expression profiles of GSE76275 from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. This microarray Super-Series sets are composed of gene expression data from 265 samples which included 67 non-TNBC and 198 TNBC. Next, all the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with p<0.01 and fold change ≥1.5 or ≤-1.5 were identified.  Result:   56 upregulated and 151 downregulated genes were listed and the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed. These significantly changed genes were mainly involved in the biological process termed prostate gland morphogenesis, inner ear morphogenesis, cell maturation, digestive tract morphogenesis, autonomic nervous system development, monovalent inorganic anion homeostasis, neural crest cell development, regulation of dendrite extension and glial cell proliferation, immune system process termed T cell differentiation, regulation of immune response, and macrophage activation. Genes are mainly involved in the KEGG pathway termed Oocyte meiosis. All DEGs underwent survival analysis using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) integrated by cBioPortal, of which amplification of SRY-related HMG-box 8 (SOX8), androgen receptor (AR), and Chromosome 9 Open Reading Frame 152 (C9orf152) were significantly negative while Nik Related Kinase (NRK) and RAS oncogene family 30 (RAB30) were positively correlated to the life expectancy (p<0.05).

Purpose:   To investigate the power of combining histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of tumor diffusion volume (tDv) with clinical information for the differentiation of low-grade (Gleason score [GS] ≤6) and high-grade (GS ≥7) PCa.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   Fifty-nine PCa patients who underwent preoperative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (acquired with b = 0, 1000 mm2 /s) and followed by radical prostatectomy within 6 months.  Sequences:   T2 -weighted, DWI, and ADC images at 3.0T.  Assessment:   tDv defined with different ADC thresholds were analyzed for each patient and combined with age and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Binary logistic regression with backward feature selection was applied to determine the best discrimination and corresponding combination of parameters.  Statistical tests:   Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; independent samples t-test; Mann-Whitney U-test; Spearman's rank correlation; receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis; binary logistical regression.  Results:   PSA and the 10th percentile ADC value of tDv defined with different diffusion thresholds were significantly different between low-grade and high-grade PCa groups (P < 0.05 for all). Median ADC of tDv based on a threshold of 1.008 × 10-3 mm2 /s exhibited the best performance (AUC = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75-0.94), whereas binary logistic regression with backward feature selection achieved 97.20% accuracy with AUC = 0.978 (95% CI: 0.929-0.997).  Data conclusion:   The discriminatory power of a single histogram variable of ADC in tDv was not significantly superior to that of a single clinical parameter. The combination of histogram analysis of ADC of tDv and clinical information using logistic regression might significantly improve the risk stratification of PCa and achieve reasonably high accuracy.

In this study we investigated expression of ERG in Malaysian men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Tissues were collected from 80 patients with clinically detected prostate cancer and treated with radical prostatectomy. Cases were tested for ERG by immunohistochemistry using the mouse monoclonal antibody EP111. All blocks on 48 cases were tested in order to determine the extent of heterogeneity of ERG expression within individual cases. ERG expression was analysed in relation to patient age, ethnicity and tumour stage and grade.  Results:   Forty-six percent of cases were ERG positive. There was no significant association between ERG and tumour grade or stage. Sixty-nine percent of Indian patients had ERG positive tumours; this was significantly higher (p=0.031) than for Chinese (40%) and Malay (44%) patients. Heterogeneity of ERG expression, in which both positive and negative clones were present, was seen in 35% of evaluated cases. Evaluation by tumour foci showed younger patients had more ERG positive tumour foci than older patients (p=0.01). Indian patients were more likely to have the majority of tumour foci with ERG staining positively, compared to either Chinese or Malay patients (P <0.01).  Conclusion:   In this study, tumour expression of ERG was more likely to occur in patients of Indian ethnicity.""","""['J S J Tan', 'K C Ong', 'D B L Ong', 'A Razack', 'J Lim', 'R Yunus', 'M Sundram', 'A Rhodes']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Malays J Pathol""","""['Immunohistochemical expression of Ets-related gene-transcriptional factor in adenocarcinoma prostate and its correlation with Gleason score.', 'Utility of ERG versus AMACR expression in diagnosis of minimal adenocarcinoma of the prostate in needle biopsy tissue.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Foamy gland carcinoma of the prostate in needle biopsy: incidence, Gleason grade, and comparative α-methylacyl-CoA racemase vs. ERG expression.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'Epidemiology and genomics of prostate cancer in Asian men.']"""

U87 (human primary glioblastoma) and SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) cells treated with various concentration of well-characterized magnetic nickel ferrite nanoparticles, exposed to frequency magnetic field (FMF) and their response was studied. Ferromagnetic nanocrystalline nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) powder that characterized by XRD, TEM, SEM, FT-IR, nanosizer, and VSM techniques were prepared by a hydrothermal method in the presence of Urtica plant extract as a green precursor that acts both as reducing and capping agent. Owing to the exceptional properties of green alkalinized agent such as minor toxicity, higher biodegradability, high active surface and environment compatibility, we used the green alkalinized agent (Utrica) to prepared nanostructures for the first time. According to the obtained results, the FMF exposure caused an increase in cell death in neural cell types 48 h after treatment. MNPs indicated dose-dependent cytotoxicity but the amount of cell death per cell in the absence of MFM for SH-SY5Y cells was more than in U87 cells. On the other hand, cell death induced by FMF exposure was observed specifically in SH-SY5Y cells. Nevertheless, it is essential to perform more investigations to find the exact related mechanisms.

Methods:   Clinicopathologic data of 533 men who underwent both TB and SB from 2014 to 2017 was analyzed. TB was performed in addition to SB in patients with detection of MRI suspicious lesions. Three patient cohorts were established: (1) biopsy naïve (80/533, 15.0%), (2) active surveillance (185/533, 34.7%), and (3) prior negative biopsy (268/533, 50.3%). Cancer risk categorical criteria were established with recommended radiotherapy treatment for each. Variation of risk classification due to biopsy method for all patients and within each cohort was analyzed using either a chi-squared statistic or Fisher's exact test. McNemar's pairwise analyses were performed for all risk categories between TB and SB to assess the effects of TB on high-risk cancer identification and subsequent radiotherapy recommendations.  Results:   Number of patients within cancer risk categories (1. ""No Cancer or Low-Risk""; 2. ""More Favorable Intermediate-Risk""; 3. ""Less Favorable Intermediate-Risk""; 4. ""High-Risk"") varied significantly based on TB and SB pathology among all patients combined (P <.0001), in cohort 2 (P = .0005), and in cohort 3 (P <0.0001). Further, among all patients, TB increased cancer risk classification and correspondingly would result in more aggressive radiotherapy recommendations: ""No Cancer or Low-Risk"" to ""Less Favorable Intermediate-Risk"" (30/343, P <0.0001) and ""No Cancer or Low-Risk"" to ""High-Risk"" (31/353, P <.0001).

Bounce characteristics, histological, clinical, and dosimetric data in young patients were analyzed, as well as their impact on toxicity and survival.  Material and methods:   This retrospective study included patients aged ≤60 years treated with exclusive iodine 125 brachytherapy with low or intermediary prostate adenocarcinoma during 1999-2014. Exclusion criteria were a follow-up of ≤24 months. PSA bounce was defined as a ≥0.2-ng/mL increase above the interval PSA nadir, followed by a decrease to nadir or below.  Results:   This study analyzed 179 patients. Median age was 56 years (46-59 years). The median follow-up was 79 months (54; 123). The bounce incidence was 56.8% (49.6%; 64.2%) at 5 years, inversely proportional to positive/total biopsies ratio (HR 0.98, 95% CI [0.97, 0.99]). Incidence of biochemical failure was 1.2%, 95% CI (0.3%; 4.7%), at 5 years with no difference between the bounce and no-bounce group (HR 0.96, 95% CI [0.25; 3.58]). Bounce is an unfavorable prognostic factor for grade two and three urinary toxicities 6.67 (4.14; 10.76) (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   PSA bounce is common in young people after brachytherapy.

We use a small image patch based combined feature method. Features include shape and color information and are extracted using histogram of oriented gradient and hue histogram methods. Dictionary learning based training is used to learn features and final feature vector is formed using sparse coding. For classification, we use patch image classification based on linear support vector machine and whole image thresholding. The proposed framework is evaluated using three public polyp databases. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme successfully classified polyps and normal images with over 95% of classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision.

We developed an 11-point scoring system based on SWE and these clinical parameters.  Results:   PCa was diagnosed in 51 (40.2%) of 127 patients and 192 (25.2%) of 762 sextants on initial biopsy. ROC curve analyses showed that the cutoff value (COV) for SWE was 40.8 kpa at the sextant level. The AUC of score system based on the SWE and clinical parameters (0.911) was significantly different from scoring systems based on SWE alone (0.842) or clinical parameters alone (0.868). For this 11-point scoring system, the optimal COV, Youden index, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC were 3 points, 0.66, 76.5% 89.5%, 82.98%, 85.00%, and 0.911, respectively. There were 68 negative biopsy results in patients with 0-3 points, and the detection rate of PCa was 100% in patients with scores exceeding 6 points.  Conclusion:   This 11-point scoring system based on SWE and clinical parameters has the good diagnostic performance for predicting PCa.

Men receiving ADT have differing clinical characteristics including higher PSA at diagnosis, higher Gleason grade, and higher CAPRA scores. Median ADT duration was 4 months.  Conclusions:   The use of ADT in conjunction with primary EBRT has increased in frequency and duration since 1990. Men receiving ADT have higher risk characteristics than those receiving EBRT alone. There is substantial variability in use of ADT in clinical practice.""","""['Bogdana Schmidt', 'Renu S Eapen', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Jeanette M Broering', 'Kirsten L Greene', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Matthew R Cooperberg']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Lack of Apparent Survival Benefit With Use of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients With High-risk Prostate Cancer Receiving Combined External Beam Radiation Therapy and Brachytherapy.', 'Factors associated with the omission of androgen deprivation therapy in radiation-managed high-risk prostate cancer.', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Impact of androgen deprivation therapy on survival in men treated with radiation for prostate cancer.', 'Patterns of practice in the United States: insights from CaPSURE on prostate cancer management.', 'The 17-Gene Genomic Prostate Score Assay Is Prognostic for Biochemical Failure in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer After Radiation Therapy at a Community Cancer Center.', 'Gross tumor volume delineation in primary prostate cancer on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/MRI and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI.', 'Should We Reconsider the Necessity of a Refinement of Prostate Cancer Risk Classification and Radiotherapy Treatment Strategy?

It is unknown whether this is influenced by clinicopathologic factors.  Methods:   We interrogated localized prostate adenocarcinomas with tumor DNA sequencing information from the TCGA validated (n = 333) and Nature Genetics (n = 377) datasets. Homologous recombination repair genes included in our analysis were: ATM, BRCA1/2, CDK12, CHEK1/2, FANCA, FANCD2, FANCL, GEN1, NBN, PALB2, RAD51, and RAD51C. Proportions of cases with pathogenic DNA repair mutations (and in ATM/BRCA1/2 specifically) were reported by Gleason grade group, clinical T, pathologic T, and pathologic N stage. Odds ratios and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare proportions between categories.  Results:   Patients with Gleason grade groups 3 and higher were 2.2 times more likely to harbor any DNA repair mutation (95% CI: 1.2-4.2; 10.3% versus 5.0%) and were 2.7 times more likely to have BRCA1/2 or ATM mutations (95% CI: 1.3-6.6; 7.0% versus 2.7%) compared to those in Gleason grade groups 1-2. Patients with pathologic T3 and T4 stage (pT3/pT4) were 2.6 times more likely to have any DNA repair mutation (95% CI: 1.3-6.6; 13.0% versus 5.5%) and were 3.2 times more likely to have BRCA1/2 or ATM mutations (95% CI: 1.2-11.3; 9.5% versus 3.1%) compared to those with pT2 disease. There was no difference by clinical tumor or nodal stage. Among men with Gleason grade group ≥ 3 and clinical stage ≥ cT3, 21.3% (1 in 5) had a DNA repair mutation in any gene and 11.7% (1 in 9) had a mutation in ATM/BRCA1/2.  Conclusions:   The prevalence of pathogenic DNA repair gene alterations is enriched in men with advanced tumor stages and higher Gleason grade groups, with maximal enrichment observed in those with Gleason grade group ≥ 3 and clinical stage ≥ cT3 disease.

We aimed to validate the performance of the Stockholm3 test in an independent, clinical practice cohort.  Methods:   The study-population consisted of 533 men in ages 45-75 without previous diagnosis of prostate cancer scheduled for prostate biopsy at any of three centers in Norway and Sweden. Blood samples for Stockholm3 analysis were drawn prior to systematic prostate biopsies. Clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as any finding of ISUP Grade Group (GG) 2 or higher. We calculated area under the curve (AUC) for predicting prostate cancer at biopsy and calculated. Models including PSA and PSA-density (PSA/prostate volume) were compared to a model including also clinical information, protein levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP).  Results:   263 of 533 (49%) participants were diagnosed with prostate cancer. 162 men had prostate cancer with GG ≥ 2.

Using a Stockholm3 cut-off of 10% risk of GG ≥ 2 cancer, 38% of the biopsy procedures were saved, however delaying diagnosis for 6% (n = 10) of men with GG ≥ 2 cancer. Using PSA-density 0.1 as cut-off for biopsy saved 35% of biopsies, delaying diagnosis for 16% (n = 26) of men with GG ≥ 2 cancer.

We designed a study to estimate the relative contribution of these factors on Black/White disparities in overall survival (OS) in advanced PCa.  Methods:   We identified Black and White men aged ≥ 40 years with metastatic or locally advanced PCa (cN+ cM+ and/or T3/4) between 2004 and 2010 using the National Cancer Database. We employed sequential propensity score weighting procedures to generate simulated cohorts of Black and White patients with equal demographics, access to care, treatment, and tumor characteristics. Adjusted survival analyses were used to compare survival in these simulated cohorts. The changes in relative survival after each weighting procedure were used to infer the contribution of each set of variables on the excess risk of mortality in Blacks.  Results:   In total, 35,611 men met inclusion criteria, 5927 (16.77%) of whom were Black. Survival was significantly worse for Black men after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities (hazard ratio (HR) 1.27, 95%-confidence interval (95%-CI) 1.2-1.34, p < 0.001). After simulating equal access to care, there was no significant difference in survival between races (HR 1.04, 95%-CI 0.97-1.12, p = 0.276), despite worse tumor characteristics in Blacks. After simulating equal treatment and equivalent tumor characteristics, Black men had a better survival than Whites (HR 0.93, 95%-CI 0.86-1.01, p = 0.071 and HR 0.92, 95%-CI 0.84-1.00, p = 0.043, respectively). Overall, access-related variables explained 84.7% of the excess risk of death in Black men.  Conclusion:   Our analysis of men with advanced PCa revealed worse OS among Blacks. However, when access to care, treatment, and cancer characteristics are accounted for, Black race was associated with better OS.

In this study, the effect of exogenous as well as endogenous galectin-3 on adhesion of two cell lines (low MUC1-expressing human prostate cancer PC-3M cells and non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cells) to monolayer of umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was investigated. We found that suppression of endogenous galectin-3 expression reduced tumor cell adhesion to HUVECs and also decreased cell invasion and migration. Exogenous galectin-3 promoted tumor cell adhesion to HUVECs by entering cells. Both exogenous and endogenous galectin-3 upregulated the expression of β-catenin and increased β-catenin nuclear accumulation, and subsequently upregulated the expression of N-cadherin and CD44. We deduced that both exogenous as well as endogenous galectin-3 promoted low MUC1-expressing cancer cell adhesion to HUVECs by increasing the expression of N-cadherin and CD44 via an increase of nuclear β-catenin accumulation.

Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a pentacyclic triterpenic acid isolated from the fragrant gum resin of the Boswellia serrata tree, which has shown intriguing antitumor activity against human cell lines established from PCa, colon cancer, malignant glioma, and leukemia. In this study, we examined the effects of AKBA against docetaxel-resistant PCa in vitro and in vivo as well as its anticancer mechanisms. We showed that AKBA dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in docetaxel-resistant PC3/Doc cells; its IC50 value in anti-proliferation was ∼17 μM. Furthermore, AKBA dose-dependently suppressed the chemoresistant stem cell-like properties of PC3/Doc cells, evidenced by significant decrease in the ability of mammosphere formation and down-regulated expression of a number of stemness-associated genes. The activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling pathways was remarkably enhanced in PC3/Doc cells, which contributed to their chemoresistant stem-like phenotype. AKBA (10-30 μM) dose-dependently suppressed the activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling pathways in PC3/Doc cells. In contrast, overexpression of Akt and Stat3 significantly attenuated the inhibition of AKBA on PC3/Doc cell proliferation. In docetaxel-resistant PCa homograft mice, treatment with AKBA significantly suppresses the growth of homograft RM-1/Doc, equivalent to its human PC3/Doc, but did not decrease their body weight.

We conducted an online survey within the year following its implementation to assess primary care provider (PCP) attitudes and adoption as well as to evaluate how this program affects screening rates.  Methods:   A web-based 18-item survey was programmed and was electronically mailed to practicing PCPs at clinics affiliated with the Duke Primary Care system. The survey assessed provider practices and attitudes regarding CaP screening, factors that influenced their general screening recommendations and the confidence related to communicating with patients about screening. The rate of PSA screening before and after implementation of the algorithm was reported across age and race categories.  Results:   In sum, 94 of 106 respondents (88.6%) reported discussing the benefits and harms of screening and let their patients decide (52.8%) or recommended for (31.1%) or against (4.7%) screening. Three-fourths of respondents followed a specific panel recommendation such as the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) (48.1%), DCI (20%), or the American Urological Association (AUA) (7.4%) guidelines. After integrating this algorithm into the electronic health record, the rate of prostate screening increased between 11% and 20.4% and 15.6% and 16.4% among different age and race categories, respectively. Overall, 79.2% of PCPs felt very confident regarding their ability to communicate the topic of CaP screening with patients.

Recently, more accurate prognostication was demonstrated by integrating a 22-feature genomic classifier (GC) to the NCCN stratification system. Here, we test the utility of the GC to better identify patients with IR-PCa who are sufficiently treated by RT alone.  Methods and materials:   We identified a novel cohort comprising 121 patients with IR-PCa treated with dose-escalated image guided RT (78 Gy in 39 fractions) without ADT. GC scores were derived from tumors sampled in diagnostic biopsies. Multivariable analyses, including both NCCN subclassification and GC scores, were performed for biochemical failure (prostate-specific antigen nadir + 2 ng/mL) and metastasis occurrence.  Results:   By NCCN subclassification, 33 (27.3%) and 87 (71.9%) of men were classified as having favorable and unfavorable IR-PCa, respectively (1 case unclassifiable). GC scores were high in 3 favorable IR-PCa and low in 60 unfavorable IR-PCa. Higher GC scores, but not NCCN risk subgroups, were associated with biochemical relapse (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.71] per 10% increase; P = .007) and metastasis (hazard ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.24-4.24; P = .004). GC predicted biochemical failure at 5 years (area under the curve, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59-0.91), and the combinatorial NCCN + GC model significantly outperformed the NCCN alone model for predicting early-onset metastasis (area under the curve for 5-year metastasis of 0.89 vs 0.86 [GC alone] vs 0.54 [NCCN alone]).

Accumulating evidence suggests arsenic can disrupt stem cell (SC) dynamics during the carcinogenic process. Previous work demonstrated arsenic-transformed prostate epithelial (CAsE-PE) cells can recruit prostate SCs into rapidly acquiring a cancer SC (CSC) phenotype via the secretion of soluble factors. Exosomes are small, membrane-derived vesicles that contain lipids, RNA, and proteins, and actively contribute to cancer initiation and progression when taken up by target cells. Here we hypothesized that CAsE-PE cells are recruiting SCs to a CSC-like phenotype via exosomal signaling. CAsE-PE cells secreted 700% more exosomes than parental RWPE-1 cells. CAsE-PE exosomes were enriched with oncogenic factors, including oncogenes (KRAS, NRAS, VEFGA, MYB, and EGFR), inflammation-related (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin 1B (IL1B), IL6, transforming growth factor-β, and tumor necrosis factor-A), and apoptosis-related (CASP7, CASP9, and BCL2) transcripts, and oncogenesis-associated microRNAs. When compared with SCs cultured in exosome-depleted conditioned medium (CM), SCs cultured in CM containing CAsE-PE-derived exosomes showed increased (198%) matrix metalloproteinase activity and underwent an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in morphology, suggesting an exosome-mediated transformation. KRAS plays an important role in arsenic carcinogenesis. Although KRAS transcript (>24 000%) and protein (866%) levels were elevated in CAsE-PE exosomes, knock-down of KRAS in these cells only partially mitigated the CSC-like phenotype in cocultured SCs. Collectively, these results suggest arsenic impacts both exosomal quantity and cargo. Exosomal KRAS is only minimally involved in this recruitment, and additional factors (eg, cancer-associated miRNAs) likely also play a role. This work furthers our mechanistic understanding of how arsenic disrupts SC dynamics and influences the tumor microenvironment during carcinogenesis.""","""['Ntube N O Ngalame', 'Anthony L Luz', 'Ngome Makia', 'Erik J Tokar']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Toxicol Sci""","""['Silencing KRAS overexpression in arsenic-transformed prostate epithelial and stem cells partially mitigates malignant phenotype.', 'Aberrant microRNA expression likely controls RAS oncogene activation during malignant transformation of human prostate epithelial and stem cells by arsenic.', 'Arsenic exposure transforms human epithelial stem/progenitor cells into a cancer stem-like phenotype.', 'Role of stem cell derived exosomes in tumor biology.', 'Exosomes: Emerging modulators of signal transduction in colorectal cancer from molecular understanding to clinical application.', 'miRNAs and arsenic-induced carcinogenesis.', 'Molecular mechanisms of environmental exposures and human disease.', 'Current Advances of Nanomedicines Delivering Arsenic Trioxide for Enhanced Tumor Therapy.', 'Environmental Exposures and Extracellular Vesicles: Indicators of Systemic Effects and Human Disease.', 'Nanoplastics and Arsenic Co-Exposures Exacerbate Oncogenic Biomarkers under an In Vitro Long-Term Exposure Scenario.']"""

Through interrogation of the subject's de novo, germline, balanced chromosomal translocation, we first identify a correlation between his disorders and a poorly annotated gene known as lipid droplet associated hydrolase (LDAH). Using data repositories of both germline and somatic variants, we identify convergent genomic evidence that substantiates a correlation between loss of LDAH and PCa. This correlation is validated through both in vitro and in vivo models that show loss of LDAH results in increased risk of PCa and, to a lesser extent, SNHL.

It reports dose coverage to target structures and organs at risk in the presence of interfractional motion, investigates rectal tissue sparing, and provides recommendations for lowering the rate of toxicity. We also propose probabilistic DVH based on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) table shifts from photon therapy for consideration in bone-matching CIRT treatment planning to represent probable dose to our CIRT patient population.  Methods:   At Gunma University Hospital intensity-modulated x-ray therapy (IMXT, aka IMRT) prostate cancer patients are positioned on a table which is shifted twice based on CBCT to align bones and then align prostate tissue to isocenter. These shifts thereby contain interfractional motion. A total of 1306 such table shifts from 85 patients were collected. Normal probability distributions were fit to the difference between bone-matching and prostate-matching CBCT-to-planning CT table shifts (i.e. interfractional motion). Between 2011 and 2016 CIRT prostate patients were treated with three beams to PTV1 (lateral-opposing and anterior) one per day for 9 fractions and two beams for a boost PTV2 (lateral-opposing) one per day for 7 fractions for a prescribed total of 57.6 Gy(RBE) as follows: PTV1 extends the prostate contour by 10/10, 5/10, 6/6 mm in the right/left, posterior/anterior, and superior/inferior directions, respectively, and the proximal seminal vesicles contour by 5 mm superiorly and inferiorly, 3 mm right and left. PTV2 reduces PTV1 posteriorly along a straight line to exclude the rectum and reduces the superior and inferior margins by 6 mm. Probable interfractional motion for 40 patients was simulated using each patient's own beam data as follows: The previously fit normal probability distributions were randomly sampled 2000 times per patient, and the five beams were shifted and summed with the same relative weighting as in the 16-fraction regimen. The resulting dose distribution was then scaled back down by 16/2000 to match the prescribed number of fractions. We then analyzed the resulting doses to contoured structures.  Results:   Probable dose to rectum is substantially less than planned: For example, mean+-standard deviation D2% for planned and probable DVH is 51+-1.9 and 45+-2.4, respectively. Cumulative DVH show mean CTV fraction receiving a given probable dose is less than the mean fraction receiving the corresponding planned dose for doses larger than 52 Gy(RBE), up to 19% less at 57.4 Gy(RBE). Our PTV1 margins generally cover 95% of interfractional motion but seminal vesicles and inferior prostate receive less dose than planned due to insufficient PTV2 margins.  Conclusion:   Assuming rigidly shifting interfractional motion around the prostate region and neglecting minor changes in soft tissue stopping power, interfractional motion resulted in target underdosing but better tissue sparing in all cases. Given our low rates of relapse and recurrence, it appears less curative dose is needed than previously thought or else current planning target margins may be excessive: Planning target volumes should be reconsidered with the adoption of dose verification methods. Our probable dose distributions quantify expected dose for future dose verification studies.""","""['Daniel Bridges', 'Hidemasa Kawamura', 'Tatsuaki Kanai']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A Prospective Comparison of the Effects of Interfractional Variations on Proton Therapy and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Towards automated on-line adaptation of 2-Step IMRT plans: QUASIMODO phantom and prostate cancer cases.', 'IMRT for prostate cancer: defining target volume based on correlated pathologic volume of disease.', 'A review of cone-beam CT applications for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Optimizing 3DCT image registration for interfractional changes in carbon-ion prostate radiotherapy.', 'Carbon ion radiotherapy using fiducial markers for prostate cancer in Osaka HIMAK: Treatment planning.', 'A Simulated Dosimetric Study of Contribution to Radiotherapy Accuracy by Fractional Image Guidance Protocol of Halcyon System.', 'Immunomodulatory Effects of Radiotherapy.']"""

In this work, we attempt to establish the histomorphometric basis for radiomic features for prostate cancer by (1) identifying the radiomic features from T2w MRI most discriminating of low vs. intermediate/high Gleason score, (2) identifying QH features correlated with the most discriminating radiomic features previously identified, and (3) evaluating the discriminative ability of QH features found to be correlated with spatially co-localized radiomic features. On a cohort of 36 patients (23 for training, 13 for validation), Gabor texture features were identified as being most predictive of Gleason grade on MRI (AUC of 0.69) and gland lumen shape features were identified as the most predictive QH features (AUC = 0.75).

Methods:   Three KBP models were constructed from plans from subsets of 58 post-prostatectomy patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy. TEO54 was built from 54 TEO plans, selected to represent typical clinical variations in target and organ-at-risk sizes and shapes. CHO30 and TEO30 were built from the same 30 patients populated with CHO and TEO plans, respectively. The three models were each applied to a new set of 18 patient scans and dose-volume histogram estimates (DVHEs) were generated for rectal and bladder walls and compared for each patient.  Results:   CHO30 resulted in a significantly tighter range in DVHEs (P < 0.01) for both the rectal and bladder walls compared with either of the TEO models, indicating less uncertainty in the dose estimation. Plans resulting from KBP optimization using each model were very similar.  Conclusion:   Populating a KBP model with CHO data resulted in a high quality model. Since CHO plans can be generated automatically offline in a process that necessitates little to no user interaction, a CHO-KBP model can quickly adapt to changes in plan evaluation criteria or planning techniques without the need to wait to accrue sufficient numbers of clinical TEO plans.

Available treatments often lead to the appearance of chemoresistant foci and metastases, with mechanisms still partially unknown. Within tumour mass, autophagy may promote cell survival by enhancing cancer cells tolerability to different cell stresses, like hypoxia, starvation or those triggered by chemotherapic agents. Because of its connection with the apoptotic pathways, autophagy has been differentially implicated, either as prodeath or prosurvival factor, in the appearance of more aggressive tumours. Here, in three PC cells (LNCaP, PC3, and DU145), we tested how different autophagy inducers modulate docetaxel-induced apoptosis. We selected the mTOR-independent disaccharide trehalose and the mTOR-dependent macrolide lactone rapamycin autophagy inducers. In castration-resistant PC (CRPC) PC3 cells, trehalose specifically prevented intrinsic apoptosis in docetaxel-treated cells. Trehalose reduced the release of cytochrome c triggered by docetaxel and the formation of aberrant mitochondria, possibly by enhancing the turnover of damaged mitochondria via autophagy (mitophagy). In fact, trehalose increased LC3 and p62 expression, LC3-II and p62 (p62 bodies) accumulation and the induction of LC3 puncta. In docetaxel-treated cells, trehalose, but not rapamycin, determined a perinuclear mitochondrial aggregation (mito-aggresomes), and mitochondria specifically colocalized with LC3 and p62-positive autophagosomes. In PC3 cells, rapamycin retained its ability to activate autophagy without evidences of mitophagy even in presence of docetaxel. Interestingly, these results were replicated in LNCaP cells, whereas trehalose and rapamycin did not modify the response to docetaxel in the ATG5-deficient (autophagy resistant) DU145 cells. Therefore, autophagy is involved to alter the response to chemotherapy in combination therapies and the response may be influenced by the different autophagic pathways utilized and by the type of cancer cells.""","""['Riccardo Cristofani', 'Marina Montagnani Marelli', 'Maria Elena Cicardi', 'Fabrizio Fontana', 'Monica Marzagalli', 'Patrizia Limonta', 'Angelo Poletti', 'Roberta Manuela Moretti']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['FOXM1 contributes to docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer by inducing AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy.', 'Combined N-terminal androgen receptor and autophagy inhibition increases the antitumor effect in enzalutamide sensitive and enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'mTOR kinase inhibitor pp242 causes mitophagy terminated by apoptotic cell death in E1A-Ras transformed cells.', 'Disaccharide trehalose in experimental therapies for neurodegenerative disorders: Molecular targets and translational potential.', 'Mitochondria and mitophagy: the yin and yang of cell death control.', 'Dichotomous role of autophagy in cancer.', 'siRNA-mediated stathmin1 silencing inhibits proliferation of prostate carcinoma cell line.', 'Necroptosis Induced by Delta-Tocotrienol Overcomes Docetaxel Chemoresistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Establishment and validation of individualized clinical prognostic markers for LUAD patients based on autophagy-related genes.', 'Exploring the relationship between autophagy and Gefitinib resistance in NSCLC by silencing PDLIM5 using ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction technology.']"""

Cell culture studies have suggested an anticancer potential involving multiple cellular processes, including differentiation, apoptosis, senescence, and angiogenesis. In prostate cancer cell models, P53-dependent and independent caspase-mediated apoptosis and androgen receptor (AR) antagonism have been described for bufalin at micromolar concentrations. Because a human pharmacokinetic study indicated that single nanomolar bufalin was safely achievable in the peripheral circulation, we evaluated its cellular activity within range with the AR-positive and P53 wild-type human LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro Our data show that bufalin induced caspase-mediated apoptosis at 20 nmol/L or higher concentration with concomitant suppression of AR protein and its best-known target, PSA and steroid receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (SRC-1, SRC-3). Bufalin exposure induced protein abundance of P53 (not mRNA) and P21CIP1 (CDKN1A), G2 arrest, and increased senescence-like phenotype (SA-galactosidase). Small RNAi knocking down of P53 attenuated bufalin-induced senescence, whereas knocking down of P21CIP1 exacerbated bufalin-induced caspase-mediated apoptosis. In vivo, daily intraperitoneal injection of bufalin (1.5 mg/kg body weight) for 9 weeks delayed LNCaP subcutaneous xenograft tumor growth in NSG SCID mice with a 67% decrease of final weight without affecting body weight. Tumors from bufalin-treated mice exhibited increased phospho-P53 and SA-galactosidase without detectable caspase-mediated apoptosis or suppression of AR and PSA. Our data suggest potential applications of bufalin in therapy of prostate cancer in patients or chemo-interception of prostate precancerous lesions, engaging a selective activation of P53 senescence.

We describe Dixon-VIBE Deep Learning (DIVIDE), a deep-learning network that allows synthesizing pelvis pseudo-CT maps based only on the standard Dixon volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (Dixon-VIBE) images currently acquired for AC in some commercial scanners. Methods: We propose a network that maps between the four 2-dimensional (2D) Dixon MR images (water, fat, in-phase, and out-of-phase) and their corresponding 2D CT image. In contrast to previous methods, we used transposed convolutions to learn the up-sampling parameters, we used whole 2D slices to provide context information, and we pretrained the network with brain images. Twenty-eight datasets obtained from 19 patients who underwent PET/CT and PET/MR examinations were used to evaluate the proposed method. We assessed the accuracy of the μ-maps and reconstructed PET images by performing voxel- and region-based analysis comparing the SUVs (in g/mL) obtained after AC using the Dixon-VIBE (PETDixon), DIVIDE (PETDIVIDE), and CT-based (PETCT) methods. Additionally, the bias in quantification was estimated in synthetic lesions defined in the prostate, rectum, pelvis, and spine. Results: Absolute mean relative change values relative to CT AC were lower than 2% on average for the DIVIDE method in every region of interest except for bone tissue, where it was lower than 4% and 6.75 times smaller than the relative change of the Dixon method. There was an excellent voxel-by-voxel correlation between PETCT and PETDIVIDE (R2 = 0.9998, P < 0.01). The Bland-Altman plot between PETCT and PETDIVIDE showed that the average of the differences and the variability were lower (mean PETCT-PETDIVIDE SUV, 0.0003; PETCT-PETDIVIDE SD, 0.0094; 95% confidence interval, [-0.0180,0.0188]) than the average of differences between PETCT and PETDixon (mean PETCT-PETDixon SUV, 0.0006; PETCT-PETDixon SD, 0.0264; 95% confidence interval, [-0.0510,0.0524]). Statistically significant changes in PET data quantification were observed between the 2 methods in the synthetic lesions, with the largest improvement in femur and spine lesions. Conclusion: The DIVIDE method can accurately synthesize a pelvis pseudo-CT scan from standard Dixon-VIBE images, allowing for accurate AC in combined PET/MR scanners. Additionally, our implementation allows rapid pseudo-CT synthesis, making it suitable for routine applications and even allowing retrospective processing of Dixon-VIBE data.""","""['Angel Torrado-Carvajal', 'Javier Vera-Olmos', 'David Izquierdo-Garcia', 'Onofrio A Catalano', 'Manuel A Morales', 'Justin Margolin', 'Andrea Soricelli', 'Marco Salvatore', 'Norberto Malpica', 'Ciprian Catana']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Erratum.', 'PET/MR imaging in the detection and characterization of pulmonary lesions: technical and diagnostic evaluation in comparison to PET/CT.', 'Zero-Echo-Time and Dixon Deep Pseudo-CT (ZeDD CT): Direct Generation of Pseudo-CT Images for Pelvic PET/MRI Attenuation Correction Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Multiparametric MRI.', 'Evaluation of Deep Learning-Based Approaches to Segment Bowel Air Pockets and Generate Pelvic Attenuation Maps from CAIPIRINHA-Accelerated Dixon MR Images.', 'Towards quantitative PET/MRI: a review of MR-based attenuation correction techniques.', 'MR Image-Based Attenuation Correction of Brain PET Imaging: Review of Literature on Machine Learning Approaches for Segmentation.', 'Transfer learning-based attenuation correction for static and dynamic cardiac PET using a generative adversarial network.', 'PET/MRI in practice: a clinical centre survey endorsed by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and the EANM Forschungs GmbH (EARL).', 'PET/MRI in colorectal and anal cancers: an update.', 'Construction of a Phantom for Image Quality Evaluation in PET/MRI System.', 'Using domain knowledge for robust and generalizable deep learning-based CT-free PET attenuation and scatter correction.']"""

Of the tetraspanin proteins, CD82 has been shown to promote homotypic cell-cell adhesion, which partially accounts for its role in suppressing cancer invasion and metastasis. We found here that CD82-induced cell-cell adhesion is attributed to increased E-cadherin expression through CD82-mediated downregulation of the E-cadherin repressor Snail. The Snail repression by CD82 resulted from the reduced binding of the Sp1 transcription factor to the Snail gene promoter. Notably, high CD82 expression did not allow the fibronectin matrix to induce Sp1 phosphorylation, implicating CD82 inhibition of the fibronectin-integrin signaling-dependent Sp1 activation. Meanwhile, E-cadherin upregulated by CD82 pulled β-catenin up to the membrane region, and consequently reduced the amount of cytoplasmic β-catenin that was able to move into to the nucleus. The Wnt signal-induced nuclear translocation of β-catenin was also inhibited by the CD82 function of upregulating E-cadherin. Overall, high CD82 expression was likely to suppress fibronectin adhesion-induced Sp1 activation signaling for Snail expression, resulting in continuous E-cadherin expression, which contributed not only to the maintenance of strong cell-cell adhesion but also to the blockage of nuclear β-catenin signaling.""","""['Moon-Sung Lee', 'Hee-Jung Byun', 'Jaeseob Lee', 'Doo-Il Jeoung', 'Young-Myeong Kim', 'Hansoo Lee']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['A novel function of CD82/KAI-1 on E-cadherin-mediated homophilic cellular adhesion of cancer cells.', 'The metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1 represses the TGF-β 1 and Wnt signalings inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition linked to invasiveness of prostate cancer cells.', 'The metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1 inhibits fibronectin adhesion-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells by repressing the associated integrin signaling.', 'KAI1/CD82, a tumor metastasis suppressor.', 'Interplay of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and canonical Wnt signaling.', 'ANRIL overexpression globally induces expression and alternative splicing of genes involved in inflammation in HUVECs.', 'A Functional Network Model of the Metastasis Suppressor PEBP1/RKIP and Its Regulators in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Canonical NF-κB Promotes Lung Epithelial Cell Tumour Growth by Downregulating the Metastasis Suppressor CD82 and Enhancing Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Cell Transition.', 'Role of Metastasis Suppressor KAI1/CD82 in Different Cancers.', 'Transcriptional Regulation of Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway in Colorectal Cancer.']"""

(Rutaceae) is used, either singly or as a part of a polyherbal preparation, in Nigerian traditional medicine for the management of cancer and inflammatory diseases. Currently, there is a dearth of knowledge demonstrating its anticancer potential.  Aim of the study:   This study was carried out to determine the in vitro cytotoxicity of the crude extract of the stem bark of C. aurantium, identify and isolate the bioactive constituents and to establish the cytotoxicity of such constituents.  Materials and methods:   The powdered bark of C. aurantium was extracted by MeOH at room temperature (25-34 °C) and the crude extract was partitioned successively, with n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol. Amongst the fractions, the DCM fraction was the most active and compounds were isolated from this fraction using a combination of chromatographic techniques. The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic means (MS, 1D and 2D NMR). The cytotoxicity of the extract, and the isolated compounds were evaluated by the MTT assay against four human cancer cell lines: A549 (lung), HepG2 (liver), MCF7 (breast) and PC3 (prostate). The selectivity of the isolated compounds was assessed using the normal human prostate epithelium cells (PNT2).  Results and discussion:   Of the three plant fractions, the DCM fraction showed significant cytotoxicity, with its highest activity against A549 cells (IC50 = 3.88 µg/mL) and the least activity on HepG2 cells (IC50 = 5.73 µg/mL). Six acridone alkaloids, citrusinine-I (1), citracridone-I (2), 5-hydroxynoracronycine (3), natsucitrine-I (4), glycofolinine (5) and citracridone-III (6), were isolated from the DCM fraction of C. aurantium. The isolated compounds demonstrated potent to moderate cytotoxicity (IC50 = 12.65-50.74 µM) against the cancer cells under investigation. It is noteworthy that the compounds exerted cytotoxicity at least four times more selective towards the carcinoma cells than the PNT2 cells.

Materials and methods:   Of 1,149 consecutive men who underwent prostate biopsy from October 2011 to March 2017, 135 had prebiopsy negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging with PI-RADS™ (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) score less than 3. The detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer was evaluated according to prostate specific antigen density and prior biopsy history. Clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as Grade Group 2 or greater. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of nonclinically significant prostate cancer on biopsy.  Results:   The prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer detection rates were 38% and 18%, respectively. Men with biopsy detected, clinically significant prostate cancer had a smaller prostate (p = 0.004), higher prostate specific antigen density (p = 0.02) and no history of prior negative biopsy (p = 0.01) compared to the nonclinically significant prostate cancer cohort. Prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml/cc (p <0.001) and prior negative biopsy (p = 0.005) were independent predictors of absent clinically significant prostate cancer on biopsy. The negative predictive value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for biopsy detection of clinically significant prostate cancer improved with decreasing prostate specific antigen density, primarily in men with prior negative biopsy (p = 0.001) but not in biopsy naïve men. Of the men 32% had the combination of negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml/cc and negative prior biopsy, and none had clinically significant prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. The incidence of biopsy identified, clinically significant prostate cancer was 18%, 10% and 0% in men with negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging only, men with negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml/cc, and men with negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml/cc and negative prior biopsy, respectively.  Conclusions:   We propose that a subset of men with negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml/cc and prior negative biopsy may safely avoid rebiopsy.

However, specific investigation of the risk of prostate cancer and the influence of COPD pharmacotherapy in patients with COPD is lacking. This study investigated the risk and influence of COPD pharmacotherapy on risk of prostate cancer in patients with COPD.  Methods:   This retrospective cohort study used data from Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 (LHID2005). The study cohort comprised COPD patients who received treatment between 2004 and 2008, and who were identified from the LHID2005. The control cohort comprised patients without COPD and was matched to the study cohort by age and sex. Two-stage propensity score calibration with the National Health Interview Survey 2005 was performed to obtain the missing confounders of smoking, alcohol drinking, and body mass index in the LHID. The hazard ratio (HR) and adjusted HR were estimated. Moreover, the influence of inhaled medications and other related medication on the risk of prostate cancer was analyzed by Cox proportional hazard regression.  Results:   The COPD cohort comprised 12,774 patients, and the control cohort comprised 38,322 patients (1:3). The incidence of prostate cancer was 633 per 100,000 person-years in the COPD cohort and 361 per 100,000 person-years in the control cohort. The propensity score calibration-adjusted HR was 1.62 (95% CI, 1.40-1.87, p < 0.001) in the COPD cohort. Further analysis revealed that the adjusted HR for the risk of prostate cancer was 1.61 (95% CI, 1.19-2.16, p = 0.002) in patients with COPD who used short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs) and 1.89 (95% CI, 1.40-2.54, p < 0.001) in patients with COPD who used short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs). COPD patients had lower risk of prostate cancer when using statin (HR = 0.63, 95% CI, 0.45-0.89, p = 0.010) or aspirin (HR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.35-0.85, p = 0.008).

We report the largest prospective cohort of Australian patients treated with radiotherapy for localised prostate cancer.  Methods:   One thousand, one hundred and twenty-one patients with prostate cancer were prospectively registered and treated to a dose of 70-74 Gy. Patients were classified as low, intermediate or high risk based on PSA, clinical staging and Gleason score. Intermediate-risk patients were treated with 0-6 months of hormonal therapy (ADT) and high-risk patients were offered neoadjuvant and adjuvant ADT. Overall survival (OS) and biochemical relapse-free survival (bNED) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Median follow-up was 92 months. Eight-year OS and bNED were 78.4% and 68.1% respectively in the entire cohort. OS for the low, intermediate and high-risk groups was 84.5%, 78.4% and 68% respectively. For these risk groups, bNED was 80.3%, 65.7% and 53.7% respectively. In the intermediate and high-risk group, OS and bNED decreased with increasing number of risk factors.

Background:   Discrepancies in research funding may contribute to stagnant survival rates in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for survival statistics. Funding data were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Clinical trial data were obtained from www.clinicaltrials.gov. Cancers with high mortality were included for analyses.  Results:   Since 1997, PDAC has received lesser funding ($1.41 billion) than other cancers such as breast ($10.52 billion), prostate ($4.93 billion), lung ($4.80 billion), and colorectal ($4.50 billion). Similarly, fewer clinical trials have been completed in PDAC (n = 608) compared with breast (n = 1904), lung (n = 1629), colorectal (n = 1080), and prostate (n = 1055) cancer. Despite this, since 1997, dollars invested in PDAC research produced a greater return on investment with regards to 5-year overall survival (5Y-OS) compared with breast, prostate, uterine, and ovarian cancer. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates that millions (liver, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and melanoma) and billions (colorectal and lung) of dollars were required for each additional 1% increase in 5Y-OS compared with PDAC. Funding of research towards early diagnosis of PDAC has decreased by 19% since 2007. For nearly all cancers, treatment-related research receives the highest percentage of NCI funding.  Conclusions:   Funding of PDAC research is significantly less than other cancers, despite its higher mortality and greater potential to improve 5Y-OS. Increased awareness and lobbying are required to increase funding, promote research, and improve survival.""","""['Bradley R Hall', 'Andrew Cannon', 'Pranita Atri', 'Christopher S Wichman', 'Lynette M Smith', 'Sushil Kumar', 'Surinder K Batra', 'Hongmei Wang', 'Apar Kishor Ganti', 'Aaron R Sasson', 'Chandrakanth Are']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Ann Surg""","""['Effect of prior cancer on survival outcomes for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma: a propensity score analysis.', 'The Impact of Tumor Location on Resection and Survival for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Overall survival of patients with recurrent pancreatic cancer treated with systemic therapy: a retrospective study.', 'Total pancreatectomy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: review of the National Cancer Data Base.', 'The Use of Biomarkers in Early Diagnostics of Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Assessing Pretransplant and Posttransplant Therapy Response in Multiple Myeloma Patients.', 'Synergistic Analysis of Protein Corona and Haemoglobin Levels Detects Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Utilizing cell line-derived organoids to evaluate the efficacy of a novel LIFR-inhibitor, EC359 in targeting pancreatic tumor stroma.']"""

Purpose:   To evaluate the interreader agreement in assessing prostate cancer (PCa) of PI-RADS v2, using whole-mount histology as the standard of reference.  Study type:   Monocentric prospective cohort study.  Population:   In all, 48 patients with biopsy-proven PCa referred for radical prostatectomy, undergoing staging multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) between May 2016 to February 2017.  Field strength/sequence:   3.0T system using high-resolution T2 -weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (echo-planar imaging with maximum b-value 2000 sec/mm2 ), and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (T1 -weighted high resolution isotropic volume examination; THRIVE) ASSESSMENT: Three radiologists blinded to final histology (2-8 years of experience) analyzed mpMRI images independently, scoring imaging findings in accordance with PI-RADS v2. On a per-lesion basis, we calculated overall and pairwise interreader agreement in assigning PI-RADS categories, as well as assessing malignancy with categories ≥3 or ≥4, and stage ≥pT3.  Statistical tests:   Cohen's kappa analysis of agreement.  Results:   On 71 lesions found on histology, there was moderate agreement in assigning PI-RADS categories to all cancers (k = 0.53) and clinically significant cancers (csPCa) (k = 0.47). Assessing csPCa with PI-RADS ≥4 cutoff provided higher agreement than PI-RADS ≥3 cutoff (k = 0.63 vs. 0.57). Interreader agreement was higher between more experienced readers, with the most experienced one achieving the highest cancer detection rate (0.73 for csPCa using category ≥4). There was substantial agreement in assessing stage ≥pT3 (k = 0.72).  Data conclusion:   We found moderate to substantial agreement in assigning the PI-RADS v2 categories and assessing the spectrum of cancers found on whole-mount histology, with category 4 as the most reproducible cutoff for csPCa.

Methods:   We retrospectively enrolled 2115 patients from 15 institutions in four European countries undergoing transrectal Koelis fusion biopsy from 2010 to 2017. A variable number of target (usually 2-4) and random cores (usually 10-14) were carried out, depending on the clinical case and institution habits. The overall and clinically significant prostate cancer detection rates were assessed, evaluating the diagnostic role of additional random biopsies. The cancer detection rate was correlated to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging features and clinical variables.  Results:   The mean number of targeted and random cores taken were 3.9 (standard deviation 2.1) and 10.5 (standard deviation 5.0), respectively. The cancer detection rate of Koelis biopsies was 58% for all cancers and 43% for clinically significant prostate cancer. The performance of additional, random cores improved the cancer detection rate of 13% for all cancers (P < 0.001) and 9% for clinically significant prostate cancer (P < 0.001). Prostate cancer was detected in 31%, 66% and 89% of patients with lesions scored as Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Clinical stage and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score were predictors of prostate cancer detection in multivariate analyses. Prostate-specific antigen was associated with prostate cancer detection only for clinically significant prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Koelis fusion biopsy offers a good cancer detection rate, which is increased in patients with a high Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score and clinical stage. The performance of additional, random cores seems unavoidable for correct sampling. In our experience, the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score and clinical stage are predictors of prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer detection; prostate-specific antigen is associated only with clinically significant prostate cancer detection, and a higher number of biopsy cores are not associated with a higher cancer detection rate.""","""['Marco Oderda', 'Giancarlo Marra', 'Simone Albisinni', 'Emanuela Altobelli', 'Eduard Baco', 'Valerio Beatrici', 'Andrea Cantiani', 'Antonio Carbone', 'Mauro Ciccariello', 'Jean-Luc Descotes', 'Marine Dubreuil-Chambardel', 'David Eldred-Evans', 'Giuseppe Fasolis', 'Mariaconsiglia Ferriero', 'Gaelle Fiard', 'Valerio Forte', 'Alessandro Giacobbe', 'Pardeep Kumar', 'Vito Lacetera', 'Pierre Mozer', 'Giovanni Muto', 'Rocco Papalia', 'Antonio Pastore', 'Alexandre Peltier', 'Thierry Piechaud', 'Giuseppe Simone', 'Jean-Baptiste Roche', 'Morgan Roupret', 'Olivier Rouviere', 'Roland Van Velthoven', 'Paolo Gontero']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Accuracy of Transperineal Targeted Prostate Biopsies, Visual Estimation and Image Fusion in Men Needing Repeat Biopsy in the PICTURE Trial.', 'Optimizing the Number of Cores Targeted During Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Target Biopsy.', 'How Many Targeted Biopsy Cores are Needed for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Detection during Transperineal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy?', 'Targeted biopsy: benefits and limitations.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Predictors of Prostate Cancer at Fusion Biopsy: The Role of Positive Family History, Hypertension, Diabetes, and Body Mass Index.', 'Intraoperative 3D-US-mpMRI Elastic Fusion Imaging-Guided Robotic Radical Prostatectomy: A Pilot Study.', 'Prostate cancer detection rate in men undergoing transperineal template-guided saturation and targeted prostate biopsy.', 'Feasibility and safety of targeted focal microwave ablation of the index tumor in patients with low to intermediate risk prostate cancer: Results of the FOSTINE trial.', 'Evolution of prostate cancer diagnosis: retrospective analysis of magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion guided biopsies protocol in routine practice and patients management.']"""

We studied the association of gene expression, polymorphisms of VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 genes and serum vitamin D levels as surrogate markers of disease progression in patients with acid reflux, Barrett's esophagus (BE), or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).  Methods:   We analyzed blood and tissue samples from patients with biopsy-confirmed BE or EAC for vitamin D levels, gene expressions, and polymorphisms in VDR (FokI [F/f], BsmI [B/b], ApaI [A/a], and TaqI [T/t]), CYP27B1 (HinfI [H/h]), and CYP24A1 (Hpy1881 [Y/y]). Percentages of homozygous dominant/recessive or heterozygous traits were assessed for each polymorphism in all patient subgroups.  Results:   Genomic Bb and FF polymorphisms were highly prevalent in EAC patients, whereas BE patients had a high prevalence of wild-type Hpy1881 (YY polymorphism). Some polymorphisms (Yy for CYP24A1, bb for VDR) were noted only in EAC patients. Yy and bb forms were both uniquely present in some EAC patients without associated Barrett's lesions, but not in patients with concomitant BE. AA and bb polymorphisms were associated with decreased response to neoadjuvant therapy. A high level of VDR and CYP24A1 mRNA expression was observed in EAC tissue of non-responders. Serum vitamin D deficiency was common in EAC patients.  Conclusions:   Specific polymorphisms in vitamin D metabolism-related genes are associated with the likelihood of reflux-BE-EAC progression.

Methods:   A total of 1024 consecutive patients scheduled for prostate biopsy were enrolled in this prospective study. CEUS was performed by an experienced radiologist blinded to all clinical data. Suspicious lesions on postcontrast images were sampled in addition to standard 12-core SB. The clinically significant PCa detection rate by CEUS-TB was evaluated in comparison with SB in the total cohort and in different subgroups.  Results:   In 378 of 1024 patients (36.9%), the diagnosis of PCa was histologically confirmed. PCa was detected by CEUS-TB in 306 patients (29.9%, 306/1024) and SB in 317 patients (31.0%, 317/1024, P = 0.340).

The PCa risk factors include: genetic load, obesity, diet rich in fat, hypertriglyceridemia, and exposure to androgens. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level may be elevated in prostate cancer or other prostate disorders. Fat tissue secretes adipocytokines, which increase the risk of cancer development and metastasis.  Objectives:   The aims of the study were to investigate the relationship between circulating levels of PSA, adipocytokines: omentin, leptin, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in serum obtained from patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   Forty patients diagnosed with BPH and forty diagnosed with PCa were assessed for the purpose of the study. The concentrations of omentin, leptin, HGF, and VEGF were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (EIA).  Results:   PSA level was significantly higher in the PCa group than in BPH (18.2 versus 9 ng/mL, p < 0.01), while volume of prostate gland was significantly higher in the BPH group than in PCa (39.1 versus 31.1 cm3, p = 0.02). HGF, VEGF, omentin, and leptin concentrations were significantly higher in PCa group than in BPH (359.5 versus 294.9 pg/mL, p = 0.04; 179.3 versus 127.3 pg/mL, p < 0.01; 478.8 versus 408.3 ng/mL, p = 0.01; 15.7 versus 11.2 ng/mL, p = 0.02, resp.).

However, the etiology and clinical consequences of SPCs are not well-known. We define the impact of family history on SPC and causes of mortality in these patients.  Patients and methods:   A nation-wide cohort study based on the Swedish Family-Cancer Database covering 4.4 million men and 80,449 prostate cancers diagnosed between 1990 and 2015. Relative risks (RRs) and cumulative incidence for SPCs and for familial SPC were calculated for prostate cancer patients.  Results:   SPC was diagnosed in 6,396 men and more than a third of these patients had a first-degree family history of any cancer; the familial risk was 1.37 (95% CI: 1.27-1.40), compared to 1.10 (1.08-1.16), without a family history. Cumulative incidence by the age of 83 years reached 21% for prostate cancer alone, 28% in those with SPC, and 35% in patients with SPC and family history. Family history was associated with the risk of seven specific SPCs, including colorectal, lung, kidney, bladder and skin (both melanoma and squamous cell) cancers, and leukemia. Colorectal and lung cancers were common SPCs, and family history doubled the risk of these SPCs. In patients with SPC, half of all causes of death were due to SPC and only 12.77% were due to prostate cancer. Most deaths in SPC were caused by lung and colorectal cancers.  Conclusions:   SPCs were an important cause of death in patients with prostate cancer and family history was an important risk factor for SPCs. Prevention of SPC should be essential when prostate cancer survival rates are being improved and this could start by conducting a thorough assessment of family history at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis.""","""['Subhayan Chattopadhyay', 'Otto Hemminki', 'Asta Försti', 'Kristina Sundquist', 'Jan Sundquist', 'Kari Hemminki']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Prostate cancer survivors: Risk and mortality in second primary cancers.', 'Risk of Second Primary Cancer among Prostate Cancer Patients in Korea: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Familial Risks and Mortality in Second Primary Cancers in Melanoma.', 'Is there a role for IGF-1 in the development of second primary cancers?', 'Risk of extracolonic second primary cancers following a primary colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Synchronous triple primary malignant tumours in the bladder, prostate, and lung harbouring TP53 and MEK1 mutations accompanied with severe cardiovascular diseases: A case report.', 'Risk of Second Malignant Neoplasm in Familial Non-Medullary Thyroid Cancer Patients.', 'Clinical characteristics and overall survival nomogram of second primary malignancies after prostate cancer, a SEER population-based study.', 'Incidence Differences Between First Primary Cancers and Second Primary Cancers Following Skin Squamous Cell Carcinoma as Etiological Clues.', 'Life-long follow-up of second primary lung and extra-pulmonary cancer in lung cancer patients is needed.']"""

In addition to adenocarcinoma (adeno), neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) emerges to confer ASI resistance. We have previously combined laser capture microdissection and phage antibody display library selection on human cancer specimens and identified novel internalizing antibodies binding to tumor cells residing in their tissue microenvironment. We identified the target antigen for one of these antibodies as CD46, a multifunctional protein that is best known for negatively regulating the innate immune system. CD46 is overexpressed in primary tumor tissue and CRPC (localized and metastatic; adeno and NEPC), but expressed at low levels on normal tissues except for placental trophoblasts and prostate epithelium. Abiraterone- and enzalutamide-treated mCRPC cells upregulate cell surface CD46 expression. Genomic analysis showed that the CD46 gene is gained in 45% abiraterone-resistant mCRPC patients. We conjugated a tubulin inhibitor to our macropinocytosing anti-CD46 antibody and showed that the resulting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) potently and selectively kills both adeno and NEPC cell lines in vitro (sub-nM EC50) but not normal cells. CD46 ADC regressed and eliminated an mCRPC cell line xenograft in vivo in both subcutaneous and intrafemoral models. Exploratory toxicology studies of the CD46 ADC in non-human primates demonstrated an acceptable safety profile.

ELK1 is required for AR-dependent growth in various hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer models. The amino-terminal domain of AR docks at two sites on ELK1 to coactivate essential growth genes. This study explores the ability of small molecules to disrupt the ELK1-AR interaction in the spectrum of prostate cancer, inhibiting AR activity in a manner that would predict functional tumor selectivity.  Experimental design:   Small-molecule drug discovery and extensive biological characterization of a lead compound.  Results:   We have discovered a lead molecule (KCI807) that selectively disrupts ELK1-dependent promoter activation by wild-type and variant ARs without interfering with ELK1 activation by ERK. KCI807 has an obligatory flavone scaffold and functional hydroxyl groups on C5 and C3'. KCI807 binds to AR, blocking ELK1 binding, and selectively blocks recruitment of AR to chromatin by ELK1. KCI807 primarily affects a subset of AR target growth genes selectively suppressing AR-dependent growth of prostate cancer cell lines with a better inhibitory profile than enzalutamide. KCI807 also inhibits in vivo growth of castration/enzalutamide-resistant cell line-derived and patient-derived tumor xenografts. In the rodent model, KCI807 has a plasma half-life of 6 hours, and maintenance of its antitumor effect is limited by self-induced metabolism at its 3'-hydroxyl.  Conclusions:   The results offer a mechanism-based therapeutic paradigm for disrupting the AR growth-promoting axis in the spectrum of prostate tumors while reducing global suppression of testosterone actions.

However, little is known regarding the biological role and intrinsic regulatory mechanisms of miR-1-3p in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   In this study, the expression levels of miR-1-3p were first examined in PCa cell lines and tumor tissues by RT-qPCR and bioinformatics. The in vitro and in vivo functional effect of miR-1-3p was examined further. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm target associations.  Results:   We found that miR-1-3p was significantly downregulated in advanced PCa tissues and cell lines. Low miR-1-3p levels were strongly associated with aggressive clinicopathological features and poor prognosis in PCa patients. Ectopic expression of miR-1-3p in 22RV1 and LncaP cells was sufficient to prevent tumor cell growth and cell cycle progression in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic studies revealed that miR-1-3p could directly target the mRNA 3'- untranslated region (3'- UTR) of two central cell cycle genes, E2F5 and PFTK1, and could suppress their mRNA and protein expression. In addition, knockdown of E2F5 and PFTK1 mimicked the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-1-3p overexpression on PCa progression. Conversely, concomitant knockdown of miR-1-3p and E2F5 and PFTK1 substantially reversed the inhibitory effects of either E2F5 or PFTK1 silencing alone.

Methods:   Incident cases of invasive cancer in Massachusetts from 2004-2014 were provided by the Massachusetts Cancer Registry. The incidence of cancer among the oldest old was compared with the population aged 65-74 years and 75-84 years. Joinpoint regression was used to assess trends in the rates of the most common cancers in the oldest old population.  Results:   In Massachusetts from 2004-2014, 7.4% of incident cancers in men and 10.2% of incident cancers in women were diagnosed in people aged ≥85 years. The cancer with the highest incidence among the oldest old was lung cancer among men (473.7 cases per 100,000) and breast cancer among women (347.0 cases per 100,000). From 2004-2014, there were statistically significant annual decreases in prostate cancer and colorectal cancer among the oldest old men and women, as well as lung cancer among oldest old men and breast cancer among oldest old women. The oldest old were more likely to be diagnosed at a distant stage of prostate and breast cancer than people diagnosed at ages 65-74 years and ages 75-84 years.  Conclusions:   The oldest old population in Massachusetts has a different burden of cancer incidence than the general population, including high incidence and more distant-stage disease.

At the time, the surgical team had already extensive experience in minimally invasive urologic surgery. Our aim is to describe the laparoscopic technique we currently use and to analyze our oncologic and functional results. Patients and Methods: All the patients who underwent RLRP in our institution (PONDERAS ACADEMIC HOSPITAL) from January 2015 to March 2017 were included into a prospective study. The standard preoperative protocol included blood tests, prostate biopsy, pelvis MRI and bone scintigraphy, while the particular therapy was discussed and approved by the Institutional Multidisciplinary Tumor Board. In all the 45 cases, RLRP was indicated for localized prostate cancer. Results: The average patientÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs age was 68 years (range 45 ÃÂ¢ÃÂ"" 74 years), mean preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSAi) level was 8 ng/mL (range 3ÃÂ¢ÃÂ""15 ng/mL) and prostatic volume between 26 and 52 cc. The laparoscopic approach was completed in all 45 cases ÃÂ¢ÃÂ"" no conversions to open surgery. Bilateral nerve sparing was performed in 7 cases (16%) and unilateral in 23 cases (51%). The mean operative time was 165 minutes (range 120 - 240 min), while the average blood loss was 255 mL (range 20ÃÂ¢ÃÂ""800) and two patients received blood transfusions. The mean catheterization time was 10 days (range 7ÃÂ¢ÃÂ""14 days). Positive surgical margins were observed in 8 cases (17.7%). Overall, 86% and respectively, 93% of the patients were continent during the following 3 and 6 months. 51% of the patients had erectile disfunction 6 month after the intervention. Four complications were encountered: intraoperatively - rectal injury (1 case) and postoperatively - bleeding (2 cases) and stenosis at the vesicourethral anastomosis (1 case). No mortality or late morbidity encountered. Conclusions: The radical laparoscopic prostatectomy is a safe and efficient procedure for localized prostate cancer with minimal complications and short hospitalization time, but it requires an experienced team of laparoscopic surgeons.

It is believed that hormone sensitivity is largely dependent on androgen receptor (AR) activity. Here, we found the histone demethylase KDM7A which demethylates histone H3K27 to be overexpressed in enzalutamide resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line C4-2b, and investigated the molecular mechanism whereby androgen receptor activity is regulated by KDM7A. We engineered AR-positive LNCaP cells to stably express a short-hairpin RNA against KDM7A mRNA from a lentiviral vector. By measuring AR downstream gene expression after androgen stimulation, we found that a KDM7A-deficient cell line showed lower AR downstream gene expression compared to a control cell. KDM7A knock-down in LNCaP cell line caused decreased cell proliferation. Western blot analysis with modified-histone antibody revealed that the KDM7A-knock-down LNCaP cell line had increased H3K27 di-methylation. We confirmed KDM7A binding on AR target-gene promoters after hormone stimulation in chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments. And increased H3K27 di-methylation was observed in KDM7A knock-down LNCaP stable cell. Treatment with KDM7A inhibitor, TC-E 5002, reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Finally, we observed that the KDM7A protein was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer tissue, and that this difference correlated with the Gleason score. These data suggested that KDM7A is potentially a good therapeutic target for prostate cancer drugs and can be used as potentially a good prognostic indicator for prostate cancer and related treatment strategies.""","""['Kyoung-Hwa Lee', 'Seokbong Hong', 'Minyong Kang', 'Chang Wook Jeong', 'Ja Hyeon Ku', 'Hyeon-Hoe Kim', 'Cheol Kwak']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Histone Demethylase KDM7A Regulates Androgen Receptor Activity, and Its Chemical Inhibitor TC-E 5002 Overcomes Cisplatin-Resistance in Bladder Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting the KDM4B-AR-c-Myc axis promotes sensitivity to androgen receptor-targeted therapy in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer is associated with androgen receptor activation and loss of KDM5D expression.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Coactivators in Regulation of Growth and Differentiation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Activin and BMP Signalling in Human Testicular Cancer Cell Lines, and a Role for the Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Protein Importin-5 in Their Crosstalk.', 'LncRNA JHDM1D-AS1 Is a Key Biomarker for Progression and Modulation of Gemcitabine Sensitivity in Bladder Cancer Cells.', 'Jumonji domain-containing protein RIOX2 is overexpressed and associated with worse survival outcomes in prostate cancers.', 'Epigenetic Coregulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'Comprehensive analyses of prognostic biomarkers and immune infiltrates among histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

The aim of this study was to develop a clinically feasible quality assurance (QA) procedure for sCT using the kV-cone beam CT (CBCT), in an MRI-only workflow for prostate cancer patients.  Material and method:   Three criteria were addressed; stability in Hounsfield Units (HUs), deviations in HUs between the CT and CBCT, and validation of the QA procedure. For the two first criteria, weekly phantom measurements were performed. For the third criteria, sCT, CT, and CBCT for ten patients were used. Treatment plans were created based on the sCT (MriPlannerTM ). CT and CBCT images were registered to the sCT. The treatment plan was copied to the CT and CBCT and recalculated. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics were used to evaluate dosimetric differences between the sCT plan and the recalculated CT and CBCT plans. HU distributions in sCT, CT, and CBCT were compared. Well-defined errors were introduced in the sCT for one patient to evaluate efficacy of the QA procedure.  Results:   The kV-CBCT system was stable in HU over time (standard deviation <40 HU). Variation in HUs between CT and CBCT was <60 HU. The differences between sCT-CT and sCT-CBCT dose distributions were below or equal to 1.0%. The highest mean dose difference for the CT and CBCT dose distribution was 0.6%. No statistically significant difference was found between total mean dose deviations from recalculated CT and CBCT plans, except for femoral head. Comparing HU distributions, the CBCT appeared to be similar to the CT. All introduced errors were identified by the proposed QA procedure, except all tissue compartments assigned as water.

Methods:   We evaluated 253 patients with prostate cancer treated with either immediate postoperative (adjuvant RT, n = 42; additive RT, n = 39) or salvage RT (n = 137). Thirty-five patients received salvage treatment but did not achieve a postoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) level <0.1 ng/ml and thus were excluded from analysis.  Results:   A significantly higher rate of early grade 1/2 proctitis in the immediate postoperative RT group without additional pelvic RT was observed (p = 0.02). Patients in the immediate postoperative RT group without additional pelvic RT showed significantly more early urinary tract obstructions (p = 0.003). Toxicity rates of early (<3 months) and late (3-6 months) postoperative RT were similar (p > 0.05). Baseline recovery rate of erectile dysfunction was better in patients with immediate postoperative RT without additional pelvic RT (p = 0.02; hazard ratio (HR) = 2.22, 95%-confidence interval, 95%-CI: 1.12-4.37). Recovery rate of urinary incontinence showed no significant difference in all groups (p > 0.05).  Conclusion:   Patients receiving immediate postoperative RT (adjuvant or additive RT) without additional pelvic RT experience early gastrointestinal (GI) side effect proctitis and, as well as early genitourinary (GU) toxicity urinary tract obstruction more frequently than patients treated with salvage RT. Therefore, complete recovery after surgery is essential.

Materials and methods:   Data from patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy between January 2012 and December 2013 were analyzed. Patients completed the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire at scheduled clinic visits (baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery).  Results:   Data from 211 men were evaluated. Urinary domain summary scores decreased postoperatively but improved over the 12-month follow-up period. Urinary function and incontinence had not recovered to baseline values at 12 months, whereas urinary bother and irritation/obstruction scores showed no differences from baseline at 12 months. Sexual function improved at each timepoint to 12 months but did not recover to baseline values; sexual bother was approximately 50% of baseline values at 12 months. Recovery of sexual function was significantly greater in patients who underwent robotic surgery versus those who underwent open surgery. At the end of the study period, 66.3% of patients were satisfied with the treatment they had received; multivariate analysis showed that only urinary function recovery was significantly associated with overall satisfaction.  Conclusions:   Urinary outcomes and sexual outcomes had not returned to baseline at 12 months. Recovery of sexual function was significantly greater in patients who underwent robotic surgery.

Although only few genetic variants are known to predispose to aggressive prostate cancer, synergistic interactions of HOXB13 G84E high-risk prostate cancer susceptibility mutation with other genetic loci remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the interplay of HOXB13 rs138213197 (G84E) and CIP2A rs2278911 (R229Q) germline variants on prostate cancer risk.  Experimental design:   Genotyping was done in Finnish discovery cohort (n = 2,738) and validated in Swedish (n = 3,132) and independent Finnish (n = 1,155) prostate cancer cohorts. Expression pattern analysis was followed by functional studies in prostate cancer cell models.  Results:   Interplay of HOXB13 (G84E) and CIP2A (R229Q) variants results in highest observed inherited prostate cancer risk (OR, 21.1; P = 0.000024). In addition, this synergism indicates a significant association of HOXB13 T and CIP2A T dual carriers with elevated risk for high Gleason score (OR, 2.3; P = 0.025) and worse prostate cancer-specific life expectancy (HR, 3.9; P = 0.048), and it is linked with high PSA at diagnosis (OR, 3.30; P = 0.028). Furthermore, combined high expression of HOXB13-CIP2A correlates with earlier biochemical recurrence. Finally, functional experiments showed that ectopic expression of variants stimulates prostate cancer cell growth and migration. In addition, we observed strong chromatin binding of HOXB13 at CIP2A locus and revealed that HOXB13 functionally promotes CIP2A transcription. The study is limited to retrospective Nordic cohorts.  Conclusions:   Simultaneous presence of HOXB13 T and CIP2A T alleles confers for high prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness of disease, earlier biochemical relapse, and lower disease-specific life expectancy.

We used C.B.-17 SCID mice in which we observed adrenal CYP17A activity to isolate the impact of adrenal steroids on CRPC tumors in vivo.  Experimental design:   We evaluated tumor growth and androgens in LuCaP35CR and LuCaP96CR xenografts in response to adrenalectomy (ADX). We assessed protein expression of key steroidogenic enzymes in 185 CRPC metastases from 42 patients.  Results:   Adrenal glands of intact and castrated mice expressed CYP17A. Serum DHEA, androstenedione (AED), and testosterone (T) in castrated mice became undetectable after ADX (all P < 0.05). ADX prolonged median survival (days) in both CRPC models (33 vs. 179; 25 vs. 301) and suppressed tumor steroids versus castration alone (T 0.64 pg/mg vs. 0.03 pg/mg; DHT 2.3 pg/mg vs. 0.23 pg/mg; and T 0.81 pg/mg vs. 0.03 pg/mg, DHT 1.3 pg/mg vs. 0.04 pg/mg; all P ≤ 0.001). A subset of tumors recurred with increased steroid levels, and/or induction of androgen receptor (AR), truncated AR variants, and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Metastases from 19 of 35 patients with AR positive tumors concurrently expressed enzymes for adrenal androgen utilization and nine expressed enzymes for de novo steroidogenesis (HSD3B1, CYP17A, AKR1C3, and HSD17B3).  Conclusions:   Mice are appropriate for evaluating adrenal impact of steroidogenesis inhibitors. A subset of ADX-resistant CRPC tumors demonstrate de novo androgen synthesis.

Analysis of the prostate TME has shown increased reactive stroma associated with chronic inflammatory infiltrates in African-American (AA) compared with European-American (EA) patients with prostate cancer. To better understand stromal drivers of changes in TME, we isolated prostate fibroblasts (PrF) from AA (PrF-AA) and EA (PrF-EA) prostate cancer tissues and studied their functional characteristics. PrF-AA showed increased growth response to androgens FGF2 and platelet-derived growth factor. Compared with PrF-EA, conditioned media from PrF-AA significantly enhanced the proliferation and motility of prostate cancer cell lines. Expression of markers associated with myofibroblast activation (αSMA, vimentin, and tenascin-C) was elevated in PrF-AA In vivo tumorigenicity of an AA patient-derived prostatic epithelial cell line E006AA was significantly increased in the presence of PrF-AA compared with PrF-EA, and RNA-seq data and cytokine array analysis identified a panel of potential proinflammatory paracrine mediators (BDNF, CHI3L1, DPPIV, FGF7, IL18BP, IL6, and VEGF) to be enriched in PrF-AA E006AA cell lines showed increased responsiveness to BDNF ligand compared with EA-derived LNCaP and C4-2B cells.

Objective:   To better understand the biological basis for clinical variability among different lesions, we sought to comprehensively characterize the heterogeneity of somatic gene mutations in multifocal prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   High-coverage whole-exome sequencing of 153 frozen tissue samples, taken from two to three distinct tumor foci and one non-cancerous area from each of 41 patients, covering a total of 89 tumor foci.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   State-of-the-art bioinformatics tools for mutation calling and copy number determination from whole-exome sequencing data.  Results and limitations:   We found a very high degree of interfocal heterogeneity among tumors, that is, 76% of pairwise-compared tumor foci from the same prostatectomy specimen had no point mutations in common and DNA copy number changes were rarely shared across cancer foci. The few point mutations shared across tumor foci were seldom in cancer-critical genes.  Conclusions:   In this first large genomic heterogeneity study of primary prostate cancer, we observe that different tumor foci within the same patient are genetically distinct, only rarely sharing any somatic gene mutations, including those in cancer driver genes. This heterogeneity affects how genomics-based management of prostate cancer can be implemented, as information from all tumor foci is necessary to draw valid conclusions about the cancer's genomic alterations.  Patient summary:   Most primary prostate cancers consist of multiple tumors within the same organ, but little is known about their relationships. We have compared the sets of gene mutations among such tumors and found that they only exceptionally have any in common.

Objective:   To compare the prognostic utility of previously validated immunohistochemical (IHC) markers with an expression-based cell-cycle progression (CCP) score.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified 424 men with localized PCa treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). IHC analysis was performed using a tissue microarray to examine the expression status of PTEN, Ki-67, and ERG compared with previously calculated CCP scores derived from 31 genes normalized to 15 housekeeper genes.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Associations of IHC status and CCP scores, adjusted for clinical and pathologic characteristics were performed using Cox regression and competing risks regression to examine risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR), and metastasis or PCa-specific mortality (PCSM). We compared models using concordance index (c-index) testing.  Intervention:   RP.  Results and limitations:   Median age at treatment was 59 yr, and patients were followed for a median of 114 mo after RP. By 10 yr after RP, 27% experienced BCR and 4% developed metastasis or PCSM. In a multivariable model adjusted for Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score (CAPRA-S), CCP was associated with risks of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-2.11) and metastasis/PCSM (HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.36-3.39). PTEN loss was not associated with recurrence but was associated with metastasis/PCSM (HR 5.26, 95% CI 2.57-10.7), adjusted for CAPRA-S. The c-index for models consisting of PTEN status and CAPRA-S was similar (0.80) for risk of metastasis/PCSM when compared with CCP and CAPRA-S (0.81). Integration of Ki-67 and ERG status did not improve the c-index relative to CAPRA-S and PTEN alone.  Conclusions:   PTEN status offered comparable discrimination of the risk of metastasis or death from PCa relative to a commercial RNA amplification-based CCP assay. Efforts are warranted to reduce the cost of PCa prognostic tools in order to expand access.  Patient summary:   We compared a commercial genomic signature and the expression status of single genes to predict outcomes in men with prostate cancer who were treated with surgical removal.

Promising results in terms of disease control and toxicity have been reported with 4 to 5 SBRT fractions. However, question of how far can the number of fractions with SBRT be reduced is a challenging research matter. As already explored by some authors in the context of brachytherapy, monotherapy appears to be feasible with an acceptable toxicity profile and a promising outcome. The aim of this multicenter phase I/II prospective trialis to demonstrate early evidence of safety and efficacy of a single-fraction SBRT approach for the treatment of localized disease.  Methods:   Patients with low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer without significant tumor in the transitional zone will be treated with a single SBRT fraction of 19 Gy to the whole prostate gland with urethra-sparing (17 Gy). Intrafractional motion will be monitored with intraprostatic electromagnetic transponders. The primary endpoint of the phase I part of the study will be safety as assessed by CTCAE 4.03 grading scale, while biochemical relapse-free survival will be the endpoint for the phase II. The secondary endpoints include acute and late toxicity, quality of life, progression-free survival, and prostate-cancer specific survival.  Discussion:   This is the first multicenter phase I/II trial assessing the efficacy and safety of a single-dose SBRT treatment for patients with localized prostate cancer. If positive, results of ONE SHOT may help to design subsequent phase III trials exploring the role of SBRT monotherapy in the exclusive radiotherapy treatment of localized disease.

Our initial selective PACE4 inhibitor (Ac-LLLLRVKR-NH2) has evolved to the current lead compound C23 (Ac-dLeu-LLLRVK-Amba), which is active both in vitro and in vivo. By screening natural residues, except Cys, in C-terminal P1' position, it was established that increasing hydrophobicity was improving cell permeability, which was directly translated into PCa cells antiproliferative activity.

Galbanic acid induces apoptosis in LNCaP via down-regulation of androgen receptor. However, the poor water-solubility of galbanic acid limits further in vitro and in vivo studies. In this study we present the synthesis of galbanic acid-coated Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles and their cytotoxicity evaluation on three prostate cancer cell lines, including PC3 (an androgen-independent cell line), LNCaP, and DU145 (an androgen-independent cell line). The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scattering electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and vibrating sample magnetometry. Our cytotoxicity evaluation demonstrated that galbanic acid was cytotoxic only against LNCaP cells, while the galbanic acid-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles showed cytotoxicity on all tested cells, including androgen-dependent and -independent cell lines. This indicates that other mechanisms are involved in the cytotoxicity of galbanic acid in addition to androgen receptor down-regulation. In conclusion, the loading of galbanic acid on the surface of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles turned out to be a successful approach to enhance the solubility and cytotoxicity of this compound.""","""['Leila Mohtashami', 'Narjes Ghows', 'Zahra Tayarani-Najaran', 'Mehrdad Iranshahi']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Planta Med""","""['Fabrication and spectroscopic studies of folic acid-conjugated Fe3O4@Au core-shell for targeted drug delivery application.', 'Synthesis and in vitro study of cisplatin-loaded Fe3O4 nanoparticles modified with PLGA-PEG6000 copolymers in treatment of lung cancer.', 'Synthesis, Characterization and in Vitro Evaluation of Manganese Ferrite (MnFe2O4) Nanoparticles for Their Biocompatibility with Murine Breast Cancer Cells (4T1).', 'd,l-lysine functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles for detection of cancer cells.', 'Non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor and vitamin D agonist are involved in suppressing invasive phenotype of prostate cancer cells.', 'Current advances in nanoformulations of therapeutic agents targeting tumor microenvironment to overcome drug resistance.', 'Current applications of nanomaterials in urinary system tumors.', 'Recent Advances in Nanotechnology with Nano-Phytochemicals: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Implications in Cancer Progression.', 'Surface-functionalised hybrid nanoparticles for targeted treatment of cancer.']"""

The PI-RADS™ (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) version 2 was developed to standardize the risk stratification of lesions identified on multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging. We sought to determine whether these tests are associated with an increased risk of biopsy upgrading in men on active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   We identified all patients on active surveillance at the University of California-San Francisco who had low/intermediate risk prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen 20 ng/ml or less and clinical stage T1/T2) and Gleason score 6 disease who underwent multiple biopsies and had a GPS available and/or had undergone multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging with an available PI-RADS version 2 score. The primary study outcome was biopsy upgrading, defined as an increase in the Gleason score from 3 + 3 to 3 + 4 or greater, which was analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Of the men 140 had only GPS test findings, 169 had only a PI-RADS version 2 score and 131 had both data. Each 5-unit increase in the GPS was associated with an increased risk of biopsy upgrading (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19-1.39, p <0.01). PI-RADS scores of 5 vs 1-2 (HR 4.38, 95% CI 2.36-8.16, p <0.01) and 4 vs 1-2 (HR 2.62, 95% CI 1.45-4.76, p <0.01) were also associated with an increased risk of a biopsy upgrade. On subanalysis of patients with GPS and PI-RADS version 2 scores the GPS was associated with biopsy upgrading, adding value to the clinical covariates (partial likelihood ratio p = 0.01).

Coffee intake has been associated with a lower prostate cancer incidence. We assessed whether coffee was associated with disease progression in men on active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   A total of 411 patients with newly diagnosed Gleason score 6 or 7 prostate cancer were enrolled on a prospective active surveillance protocol for at least 6 months and completed a baseline dietary assessment. The active surveillance protocol included a biennial monitoring regimen with disease progression defined as an increase in the Gleason score. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations of coffee intake with progression-free survival. We also evaluated patient genotype in the caffeine metabolism related single nucleotide polymorphism rs762551.  Results:   Median followup was 36 months (range 6 to 126) and the Gleason score progressed in 76 of the 411 patients (18.5%). Compared to 0 cups per day, in the multivariable model adjusting for prostate specific antigen, patient age and tumor length, less than 1 cup (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.40-1.71), 1 to 1.9 cups (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.29-1.43), 2 to 3.9 cups (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.35-1.47) and 4 cups or more (HR 1.67, 95% CI 0.81-3.45) were not significantly associated with progression-free survival (p for nonlinearity = 0.01).

Methods:   Defective mismatch repair (dMMR) status was determined by either loss of mismatch repair protein expression on IHC or microsatellite instability (MSI) by PCR in 127 APC biopsies from 124 patients (Royal Marsden [RMH] cohort); MSI by targeted panel next-generation sequencing (MSINGS) was then evaluated in the same cohort and in 254 APC samples from the Stand Up To Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation (SU2C/PCF). Whole exome sequencing (WES) data from this latter cohort were analyzed for pathogenic MMR gene variants, mutational load, and mutational signatures. Transcriptomic data, available for 168 samples, was also performed.  Results:   Overall, 8.1% of patients in the RMH cohort had some evidence of dMMR, which associated with decreased overall survival. Higher MSINGS scores associated with dMMR, and these APCs were enriched for higher T cell infiltration and PD-L1 protein expression. Exome MSINGS scores strongly correlated with targeted panel MSINGS scores (r = 0.73, P < 0.0001), and higher MSINGS scores associated with dMMR mutational signatures in APC exomes. dMMR mutational signatures also associated with MMR gene mutations and increased immune cell, immune checkpoint, and T cell-associated transcripts. APC with dMMR mutational signatures overexpressed a variety of immune transcripts, including CD200R1, BTLA, PD-L1, PD-L2, ADORA2A, PIK3CG, and TIGIT.

We find that CNA burden is prognostic for cancer-specific death, independent of standard clinical prognosticators. More broadly, we find CNA burden is significantly associated with disease-free and overall survival in primary breast, endometrial, renal clear cell, thyroid, and colorectal cancer in TCGA cohorts. To assess clinical applicability, we validated these findings in an independent pan-cancer cohort of patients whose tumors were sequenced using a clinically-certified next generation sequencing assay (MSK-IMPACT), where prognostic value varied based on cancer type.

However, the role of NPRL2 in regulating the resistance to Everolimus (EVS), an inhibitor of the mTOR, in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is still unclear. Therefore, in present study, we evaluated the role of NPRL2 and its potential resistance to EVS in CRPC.  Methods:   NPRL2 expression levels in prostate tissues, including benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, primary prostate cancer (PCa) tissues, CRPC tissues, and several PCa cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, and enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP, named LNPER) were be evaluated by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blot. Furthermore, we employed the loss or gain function of NPRL2 to determine the role of NPRL2 in regulating the proliferation, sensitivity to EVS, the mTOR signaling, autophagy in CRPC. Lastly, relationship between NPRL2 expression level and the efficacy of EVS were evaluated in mice tumor xenograft models.  Results:   NPRL2 expression level is upregulated in PCa, particularly in the CRPC. NPRL2 over-expression promoted the proliferation, resistance to EVS, and NPRL2 silencing inhibited proliferation, enhanced sensitivity to EVS in PC3 and LNPER cells. Moreover, NPRL2-silencing increased the activity of mTOR signaling, and the autophagy attenuation induced by NPRL2-silencing in EVS-treated CRPC cells was associated with the increase of apoptosis. In addition, the growth prevention of NPRL2-silencing LNPER tumors in mice induced by EVS-treatment was associated with the autophagy attenuation and apoptosis increase.  Conclusions:   NPRL2 may act as a pro-growth factor in PCa. The high levels of NPRL2 expression in CRPC promote resistance to EVS by enhancing autophagy. NPRL2 may be a new therapeutic target for intervention of CRPC and a biomarker for predicting resistance to EVS in CRPC.""","""['Zhixiong Chen', 'Qilong Jiang', 'Pingyu Zhu', 'Yanlin Chen', 'Xuemei Xie', 'Zhongbo Du', 'Li Jiang', 'Wei Tang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Targeting NPRL2 to enhance the efficacy of Olaparib in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'NPRL2 promotes docetaxel chemoresistance in castration resistant prostate cancer cells by regulating autophagy through the mTOR pathway.', 'NPRL2 reduces the niraparib sensitivity of castration-resistant prostate cancer via interacting with UBE2M and enhancing neddylation.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'TCTP Has a Crucial Role in the Different Stages of Prostate Cancer Malignant Progression.', 'Recent Advances in the Role of Autophagy in Endocrine-Dependent Tumors.', 'NPRL2 down-regulation facilitates the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma via the mTOR pathway and autophagy suppression.', 'Bioinformatics analysis of the prognostic and immunotherapeutic significance of NPRL2 in stomach adenocarcinoma.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Autophagy Modulation by Viral Infections Influences Tumor Development.']"""

Materials and methods:   Data of 924 consecutive patients who underwent RARP for prostate cancer (PCa) and who have at least 1-year follow-up were evaluated retrospectively. All patients were divided into two groups: Group 1(n=252) included patients with ML and Group 2 (n=672) included patients without ML. The primary endpoint of this study was to compare complication rates between two groups. The secondary endpoints were to compare PSM, BCR and UC rates.  Results:   Both groups were statistically similar in terms of demographics and variables about PCa. Mean prostate volume was higher in Group 1 vs. Group 2 (69± 31 vs. 56±23 mL, p<.001). Total operative time was longer in Group 1 vs. Group 2 (144±38 vs. 136±44 min, p=.01). Biochemical recurrence, PSM, perioperative and postoperative complication rates of our population were 13.6%, 14.9%, 1.7% and 8.7%, respectively. There were no statistical differences in terms of perioperative complication, PSM and BCR rates between the groups(p>0.05). At the first month after RARP, total continence rate was statistically significant lower in Group 1 vs. Group 2 (49.2% and 56.5%, p=.03), respectively.

Unfortunately, 10-46% of patients may still suffer from limited erectile function (EF) after RARP. This study aimed to develop a prediction model based on the extent of fascia preservation (FP) and postoperative EF after RARP. A previously developed FP score quantizing the extent and regions of nerve-preservation was determined in a cohort of 1241 patients who underwent RARP. The predictive value of the FP score for post-prostatectomy EF (following the international index erectile function (IIEF) score, EF domain) was analyzed. To increase the predictive value of the scoring system, the FP regions were related to postoperative EF, nerve distribution and co-morbidity factors. Finally, a prediction model for EF was developed based on the studied cohort. When corrected for the preoperative IIEF-EF, the FP score was shown to be a significant denominator for IIEF (p = 2.5 × 10- 15) with an R2 of 35%. Variable selection performed using the Akaike information criterion led to a final prediction model for postoperative IIEF after nerve-preservation based on the FP score. Furthermore, patient's age, preoperative IIEF score, CCIS and use of clips for nerve sparing were significantly associated with postoperative IIEF-EF. More anterior fascia preservation was correlated with better EF outcome and age was a strong independent predictor of EF outcome. In older men, the relative benefit of more extensive fascia preservation was at least similar to younger men, despite a lower baseline IIEF-EF score. Quantitative nerve-sparing FP scoring could be related to the postoperative IIEF-EF and integrated into a multivariate prediction model, which includes with age, use of surgical clips, the Charlson Comorbidity Index Score (CCIS), and preoperative IIEF-EF. When further validated the prediction model could provide patients and care-givers a qualitative estimation of EF outcome after RARP.""","""['G H KleinJan', 'K Sikorska', 'C M Korne', 'O R Brouwer', 'T Buckle', 'C Tillier', 'R C M van der Roest', 'J de Jong', 'F W B van Leeuwen', 'H G van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['Significance of erection hardness score as a diagnostic tool to assess erectile function recovery in Japanese men after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The value of periprostatic fascia thickness and fascia preservation as prognostic factors of erectile function after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Medical hypothesis: loss of the endocrine function of the prostate is important to the pathophysiology of postprostatectomy erectile dysfunction.', 'Fluorescence-guided radical prostatectomy.', 'Development and clinical applicability of MRI-based 3D prostate models in the planning of nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Precision surgery: the role of intra-operative real-time image guidance - outcomes from a multidisciplinary European consensus conference.', 'Applications of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and prediction of erectile dysfunction: a narrative review.', 'Intraoperative visualization of nerves using a myelin protein-zero specific fluorescent tracer.']"""

However, it is not yet proven how different sources of information influence uncertainty and disease-specific anxiety. The aim of this study is to investigate to what extent different types of information sources, the number of used sources and the perceived level of information are predictive of disease-specific anxiety.  Materials and methods:   Men with LPCa (N = 292; n = 150 radical prostatectomy, n = 142 active surveillance) completed questionnaires assessing sociodemographic variables, number and type of sources of information used, perceived level of information, and disease-specific anxiety. The association of information-seeking behavior with anxiety was tested using moderated sequential multiple regression.  Results:   Men were 70 ± 7.2 years old and the survey was taken 47.9 ± 15.4 months after decision for therapy. The multiple regression analysis showed that, after controlling for potential covariates, internet usage (β = 3.28; p > 0.001), number of sources (β = 1.09; p > 0.01) and a lower level of informedness (β = 4.49; p > 0.001) independently predicted variability of anxiety. In addition, the 3‑way interaction (β = 2.03; p > 0.05) accounted for a significant proportion of variance. Overall, the model explained 30% of the criterion variance.  Conclusions:   Our results show that many men with LPCa already use the internet as a source of information and that this online search is associated with increased disease-specific anxiety.

Enzalutamide is an approved drug that inhibits AR activity and increases overall survival. However, resistance to enzalutamide develops rapidly often by increasing AR activity, suggesting that new therapies are required for CRPC. We investigated whether betulinic acid (BA), a small molecule from plants that inhibits multiple deubiquitinases (DUBs), reduces AR, and selectively kills PCa cells, can provide an adjuvant strategy for CRPC. Our data indicated that BA reduced AR protein stability and mRNA expression, making it an attractive agent for CRPC. BA decreased AR mRNA possibly by inhibiting a histone 2A DUB thereby increasing ubiquitinated histone 2A, a transcriptional repressor. We identified multiple and specific DUBs inhibited by BA either in PCa cells or using recombinant DUBs. Similar results were obtained using another multi-DUB inhibitor WP1130, suggesting that these DUB inhibitors can decrease AR expression and increase PCa-specific death. Our results also suggest that combining multi-DUB inhibitors BA or WP1130 with enzalutamide may provide a novel strategy for CRPC by further decreasing AR expression and increasing apoptotic cell death.""","""['Alicia de Las Pozas', 'Teresita Reiner', 'Virginia De Cesare', 'Matthias Trost', 'Carlos Perez-Stable']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Melatonin Inhibits Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 (AR-V7)-Induced Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) Activation and NF-κB Activator-Induced AR-V7 Expression in Prostate Cancer Cells: Potential Implications for the Use of Melatonin in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Therapy.', 'Epigenetic Reprogramming with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Effectiveness of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of drug resistance that target the androgen axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.', 'A clickable photoaffinity probe of betulinic acid identifies tropomyosin as a target.', 'Deubiquitination in prostate cancer progression: role of USP22.', 'Elevated Serum FGG Levels Prognosticate and Promote the Disease Progression in Prostate Cancer.', 'High-throughput matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry-based deubiquitylating enzyme assay for drug discovery.']"""

However, little is known about what promotes the metastasis of prostate cancer and there is a lack of effective prognostic indicators, making it immensely difficult to manage options for treatment or surveillance. Arginyltransferase 1 (Ate1) is the enzyme mediating post-translational protein arginylation, which has recently been identified as a master regulator affecting many cancer-relevant pathways including stress response, cell cycle checkpoints, and cell migration/adhesion. However, the precise role of Ate1 in cancer remains unknown. In this study, we found the occurrence of metastasis of prostate cancer is inversely correlated with the levels of Ate1 protein and mRNA in the primary tumor. We also found that metastatic prostate cancer cell lines have a reduced level of Ate1 protein compared to non-metastatic cell lines, and that a depletion of Ate1 drives prostate cancer cells towards more aggressive pro-metastatic phenotypes without affecting proliferation rates. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a reduction of Ate1 can result from chronic stress, and that shRNA-reduced Ate1 increases cellular resistance to stress, and drives spontaneous and stress-induced genomic mutations. Finally, by using a prostate orthotropic xenograft mouse model, we found that a reduction of Ate1 was sufficient to enhance the metastatic phenotypes of prostate cancer cell line PC-3 in vivo.

For faecal incontinence, the AUC went up from 0.63 (NTR only), to 0.68 (+DVH) and 0.73 (+TA). For nocturia, adding TA features resulted in an AUC increase from 0.64 to 0.66, while no improvement was seen when including DVH parameters in the modelling. For urinary incontinence, the AUC improved from 0.68 to 0.71 (+DVH) and 0.73 (+TA). For GI, model improvements resulting from adding TA parameters to NTR instead of DVH were statistically significant (p < 0.04).

We sought to determine rates of patients becoming lost to follow-up (LTFU) and associated risk factors in a large AS cohort. The Michigan Urologic Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) maintains a prospective registry of PC patients from 44 academic and community urology practices. Over a 6-yr period (2011-2017), we identified patients managed with AS. LTFU was defined as any 18-mo period where no pertinent surveillance testing was entered in the registry. With a median surveillance period of 32 mo, the estimated 2-yr LTFU-free probability calculated by Kaplan-Meier method was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]=89-92%). Both African American race (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.77, 95% CI=1.81-4.24) and Charlson comorbidity index ≥1 (HR: 1.55, 95% CI=1.08-2.23) were independently associated with increased risk of LTFU. There was variability in rates of estimated 2-yr LTFU-free survival across MUSIC practices, ranging from 52% (95% CI=21-100%) to 99% (95% CI=97-100%), with a median of 96% (interquartile range: 94-98%), although this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.076). These data reveal opportunities for urology practices to identify systems to reduce rates of LTFU and improve the long-term safety of AS. PATIENT SUMMARY: With a median observation period of 32 mo, an estimated 10% of patients will be lost to follow-up at the 2 yr time point while on AS. African American men and generally unhealthy patients were at increased risk, and there was variability from one urology practice to another. There is ample opportunity to improve the quality of the performance of AS.""","""['Kevin B Ginsburg', 'Gregory B Auffenberg', 'Ji Qi', 'Isaac J Powell', 'Susan M Linsell', 'James E Montie', 'David C Miller', 'Michael L Cher']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['""Real-world"" Practice Makes Perfect: Ensuring the Active Component of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'Contemporary use of initial active surveillance among men in Michigan with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Variation in Guideline Concordant Active Surveillance Followup in Diverse Urology Practices.', 'Association Between African American Race and Clinical Outcomes in Men Treated for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer With Active Surveillance.', 'Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'Active surveillance: the Canadian experience.', 'Active Surveillance in Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Review of the Current Data.', 'Intensity of observation with active surveillance or watchful waiting in men with prostate cancer in the United States.', 'Five-year follow-up study of a population-based prospective cohort of men with low-risk prostate cancer: the treatment options in prostate cancer study (TOPCS): study protocol.', 'Factors associated with loss to follow-up after radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.', 'Can the LACE index help identify uninsured patients at risk of loss to follow-up during a pharmacist-led transitions of care program?']"""

There is still a considerable number of undiagnosed cancers, especially in early stage, despite frozen section analysis. The aim of the study was to evaluate outcomes of orthotopic liver transplants (OLTx) with organs from donors with prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed in deceased liver donors whose prostate glands were harvested for histologic examinations because of prostate cancer suspicion. The study group consisted of 72 men reported as potential liver donors between 2011 and November 2017. Prostate glands were primarily assessed by frozen sections and afterward in routine examination. Generally cancer diagnosed in frozen specimen was not considered for OLTx. Recipients who received an organ from the donor with prostate cancer were actively surveilled.  Results:   There were 19 cases (26.40%) of prostate cancer diagnosed among the study group. In 12 cases diagnosis was made by frozen section assessment, of which 11 organs were disqualified from OLTx and 1 was transplanted. In 7 cases prostate cancer was diagnosed after OLTx in final routine histologic examination. Finally, 8 recipients (5 men and 3 women) received a new organ. Only 1 died during the perioperative period. In the remaining 7 patients the perioperative period was uneventful and no disease transmission was observed during follow-up.  Conclusions:   Diagnosis of prostate cancer in donors should not be treated as a contraindication for OLTx because the risk of disease transmission is low. Potential recipients must be fully informed and kept under oncological surveillance.""","""['M Skalski', 'B Gierej', 'Ł Nazarewski', 'B Ziarkiewicz-Wróblewska', 'K Zieniewicz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Transplant Proc""","""['Prostate Cancer in Deceased Liver Donors.', 'Lessons Learned From Review of a Single Center Experience With 500 Consecutive Liver Transplants in a Region With Insufficient Deceased-Donor Support.', 'Liver transplantation in the United States.', 'Renal donors with prostate cancer, no longer a reason to decline.', 'Malignancies in Deceased Organ Donors: The Spanish Experience.']"""

The extent to which providers in the community adhere to quality measures in radiation therapy (RT) is unknown.  Methods and materials:   The Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation study enrolled men with clinically localized prostate cancer in 2011 and 2012. Patients completed surveys and medical records were reviewed. Patients were risk-stratified according to D'Amico classification criteria. Patterns of care and compliance with 8 quality measures as endorsed by national consortia as of 2011 were assessed.  Results:   Overall, 926 men underwent definitive RT (69% external beam radiation therapy [EBRT]), 17% brachytherapy (BT), and 14% combined EBRT and BT with considerable variation in radiation techniques across risk groups. Most men who received EBRT had dose-escalated EBRT (>75 Gy; 93%) delivered with conventional fractionation (<2 Gy; 95%), intensity modulated RT (76%), and image guided RT (85%). Most men treated with BT received I125 (77%). Overall, 73% of the men received EBRT that was compliant with the quality measures (dose-escalation, image-guidance, appropriate use of androgen deprivation therapy, and appropriate treatment target) but only 60% of men received BT that was compliant with quality measures (postimplant dosimetry and appropriate dose). African-American men (64%) and other minorities (62%) were less likely than white men (77%) to receive EBRT that was compliant with quality measures.  Conclusions:   Most men who received RT for localized prostate cancer were treated with an appropriately high dose and received image guidance and intensity modulated RT. However, compliance with some nationally recognized quality measures was relatively low and varied by race. There are significant opportunities to improve the delivery of RT and especially for men of a minority race.""","""['Daniel J Lee', 'Daniel A Barocas', 'Zhiguo Zhao', 'Li-Ching Huang', 'Tatsuki Koyama', 'Matthew J Resnick', 'Ralph Conwill', 'Dan McCollum', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Michael Goodman', 'Sheldon Greenfield', 'Ann S Hamilton', 'Mia Hashibe', 'Sherrie H Kaplan', 'Lisa E Paddock', 'Antoinette M Stroup', 'Xiao-Cheng Wu', 'David F Penson', 'Karen E Hoffman']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer: patterns of care in Sweden 1998-2016.', 'Ten-year survival after High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy combined with External Beam Radiation Therapy in high-risk prostate cancer: A comparison with the Norwegian SPCG-7 cohort.', 'Racial variation in receipt of quality radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Evolution of definitive external beam radiation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Combination of brachytherapy and external beam radiation for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'GammaTile: Comprehensive Review of a Novel Radioactive Intraoperative Seed-Loading Device for the Treatment of Brain Tumors.', 'Disparities in the Utilization of Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer in the United States: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Patient-Reported Outcomes Through 5 Years for Active Surveillance, Surgery, Brachytherapy, or External Beam Radiation With or Without Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Corosolic acid (CA), a natural triterpenoid, has anti-cancer activity with limited side effects. However, CA anti-prostate cancer activities and mechanisms, particularly in CRPC, are not clearly understood. In this study, we investigated CA anti-tumor ability against human CRPC and its mechanism of action.  Methods:   The cell apoptosis and proliferation effects were evaluated via MTT detection, colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Western blot, gene transfection and immunofluorescence assay were applied to investigate related protein expression of Endoplasmic reticulum stress. A xenograft tumor model was established to investigate the inhibitory effect of CA on castration resistant prostate cancer in vivo.  Results:   The results showed that CA inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cell (PCa) line PC-3 and DU145, as well as retarded tumor growth in a xenograft model, exerting a limited toxicity to normal cells and tissues. Importantly, CA activated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated two pro-apoptotic signaling pathways, as evidenced by increased protein levels of typical ER stress markers including IRE-1/ASK1/JNK and PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP. IRE-1, PERK or CHOP knockdown partially attenuated CA cytotoxicity against PCa cells. Meanwhile, CHOP induced expression increased Tribbles 3 (TRIB3) level, which lead to AKT inactivation and PCa cell death. CHOP silencing resulted in PCa cells sensitive to CA-induced apoptosis.  Conclusion:   Our data demonstrated, for the first time, that CA might represent a novel drug candidate for the development of an anti-CRPC therapy.""","""['Bo Ma', 'Hang Zhang', 'Yu Wang', 'Ang Zhao', 'Zhiming Zhu', 'Xiaowen Bao', 'Yang Sun', 'Lin Li', 'Qi Zhang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Mechanism of the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress by the anti-cancer agent, di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT): Activation of PERK/eIF2α, IRE1α, ATF6 and calmodulin kinase.', 'Dienogest regulates apoptosis, proliferation, and invasiveness of endometriotic cyst stromal cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress induction.', 'Emodin induces apoptosis of lung cancer cells through ER stress and the TRIB3/NF-κB pathway.', 'The Role of the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP Signaling Pathway in Tumor Progression During Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.', 'Unfolding anti-tumor immunity: ER stress responses sculpt tolerogenic myeloid cells in cancer.', 'Modulation of Cell Death Pathways for Cellular Protection and Anti-Tumoral Activity: The Role of Thymus spp. Extracts and Their Bioactive Molecules.', 'Corosolic Acid Inhibits Secretory Phospholipase A2IIa as an Anti-Inflammatory Function and Exhibits Anti-Tumor Activity in Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma Bearing Mice.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'Corosolic acid sensitizes ferroptosis by upregulating HERPUD1 in liver cancer cells.', 'Recent Advances Regarding the Molecular Mechanisms of Triterpenic Acids: A Review (Part II).']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether haematological parameters reflect serum iron levels and may also be associated with cancer risk.  Methods:   We studied 1564 men and 1769 women who were enrolled in the Busselton Health Study, Western Australia. Haematological parameters evaluated included haemoglobin (Hb), mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) and mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and red cell distribution width (RCDW). Statistical analyses included t-tests for quantitative variables, chi-square tests for categorical variables and Cox proportional hazards regression modelling for cancer incidence and death.  Results:   There was marginal evidence of an association between MCV (as a continuous variable) and non-skin cancer incidence in women (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.013, 1.302; p = 0.030) but the hazard ratio was attenuated to non-significance after adjustment for serum ferritin (SF), iron and transferrin saturation (TS) (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.972, 1.264; p = 0.126). There was strong evidence of an association between MCHC and prostate cancer incidence in men; the estimated hazard ratio for an increase of one SD (0.5) in MCHC was 1.27 (95% CI 1.064, 1.507; p = 0.008). These results remained significant after further adjustment for SF and iron; the estimated hazard ratio for an increase of one SD (0.5) in MCHC was 1.25 (p = 0.014, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.48).  Conclusions:   The MCHC and MCV were associated with cancer incidence in a Western Australian population, although only MCHC remained associated with prostate cancer after adjusting with serum iron and TS (circulating iron) and SF (storage iron).

Methods:   The AQP transcript and protein expression of HPrEC, LNCaP, DU-145 and PC3 cell lines was investigated using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy labelling. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to assess AQP protein expression in surgical specimens of benign prostatic hyperplasia as well as in PC. Tissue mRNA expression of AQPs was quantified by single-step reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Relative gene expression was determined using the 40-ΔCT method and correlated to clinicopathological parameters.  Results:   Transcripts of AQP 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11 were expressed in all four cell lines, while AQP 9 transcripts were not detected in malignant cell lines. IF microscopy confirmed AQP 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 protein expression. IHC revealed highly heterogeneous AQP 3 protein expression in PC specimens, with a marked decrease in expression in tumours of increasing malignancy. Loss of AQP 9 was shown in PC specimens. mRNA expression of AQP3 was found to be negatively correlated to PSA levels (ρ = - 0.354; p = 0.013), D'Amico risk stratification (ρ = - 0.336; p = 0.012), ISUP grade (ρ = - 0.321; p = 0.017) and Gleason score (ρ = - 0.342; p = 0.011).  Conclusions:   This is the first study to systematically characterize human prostate cell lines, benign prostatic hyperplasia and PC in relation to all 13 members of the AQP family. Our results indicate the differential expression of several AQPs in benign and malignant prostate tissue. A significant correlation was observed between AQP 3 expression and tumour grade, with progressive loss in more malignant tumours.

Blood boric acid (BA) levels are approximately 10 μM BA in men at the mean US boron intake. Treatment of DU-145 human prostate cancer cells with 10 μM BA stimulates phosphorylation of elongation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) at Ser51 leading to activation of the eIF2α/ATF4 pathway which activates the DNA damage-inducible protein GADD34. In the present study, we used MEF WT and MEF PERK (±) cells to test the hypothesis that BA-activated eIF2α phosphorylation requires protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and activates Nrf2 and the antioxidant response element (ARE). BA (10 μM) increased phosphorylation of eIF2α Ser51 in MEF WT cells at 1 h, but not in MEF Perk -/- cells exposed for as long as 6 h. GCN2 kinase-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α Ser51 was activated in MEF PERK -/- cells by amino acid starvation. Nrf2 phosphorylation is PERK dependent and when activated is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor for ARE. DU-145 cells were treated with 10 μM BA and Nrf2 measured by immunofluorescence. Cytoplasmic Nrf2 was translocated to the nucleus at 1.5-2 h in DU-145 and MEF WT cells, but not MEF PERK -/- cells. Real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of three ARE genes (HMOX-1, NQO1, and GCLC).

We reviewed prostate MRs looking for sequelae of embolization [changes in signal intensity and/or enhancement, infection/inflammation, infarction, edema, and change in intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP)]. We calculated the total volume (TV) and central gland volumes (CGV) using DynaCAD® and measured change in volumes. Analyses were performed using SPSS with p < 0.05 considered significant.  Results:   Forty-three patients (n = 43) met our inclusion criteria. 93% (30/43) and 100% (43/43) showed a decrease in TV and CGV at 6-months respectively. At baseline, median TV was 86 cc (range 29.4-232) and median CGV was 54.4 cc (range 12.9-165.5). Median decrease in TV was 18.2% (CI 13.3-27.2) (p = 0.0001) and median decrease in CGV was 26.7% (CI 20.4-35.9) (p = 0.0001). Thirty-seven percent (16/43) of patients had IPP at baseline; 100% showed a decrease in size of median lobe at follow-up. At 6-month follow-up, 33% (14/43) showed imaging features of infarction, 79% (34/43) had decrease in T2-signal intensity, and 51% (22/43) showed a decrease in enhancement. None had edema, peri-prostatic fat changes or infection/inflammation.  Conclusion:   PAE causes a statistically significant reduction in the TV and CGV.

Data from academic centers suggest that GG better distinguishes between prostate cancer risk groups than the Gleason score (GS) risk groups. We compared the performance of the 2 systems to predict pathological/recurrence outcomes using data from the MUSIC (Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative).  Materials and methods:   Patients who underwent biopsy and radical prostatectomy in the MUSIC from March 2012 to June 2017 were classified according to GG and GS. Outcomes included the presence or absence of extraprostatic extension, seminal vesical invasion, positive lymph nodes, positive surgical margins and time to cancer recurrence (defined as postoperative prostate specific antigen 0.2 ng/ml or greater). Logistic and Cox regression models were used to compare the difference in outcomes.  Results:   A total of 8,052 patients were identified. When controlling for patient characteristics, significantly higher risks of extraprostatic extension, seminal vesical invasion and positive lymph nodes were observed for biopsy GG 3 vs 2 and for GG 5 vs 4 (p <0.001). Biopsy GGs 3, 4 and 5 also showed shorter time to biochemical recurrence than GGs 2, 3 and 4, respectively (p <0.001). GGs 3, 4 and 5 at radical prostatectomy were each associated with a greater probability of recurrence compared to the next lower GG (p <0.001). GG (vs GS) had better predictive power for extraprostatic extension, seminal vesical invasion, positive lymph nodes and biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   GG at biopsy and radical prostatectomy allows for better discrimination of recurrence-free survival between individual risk groups than GS risk groups with GGs 2, 3, 4 and 5 each incrementally associated with increased risk.""","""['Samer Kirmiz', 'Ji Qi', 'Stephen K Babitz', 'Susan Linsell', 'Brian Denton', 'Karandeep Singh', 'Gregory Auffenberg', 'James E Montie', 'Brian R Lane']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Improved risk stratification for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy using a novel risk group system based on prostate specific antigen density and biopsy Gleason score.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Tertiary Gleason pattern in radical prostatectomy specimens is associated with worse outcomes than the next higher Gleason score group in localized prostate cancer.', 'The significance of micro-lymphatic invasion and pathological Gleason score in prostate cancer patients with pathologically organ-confined disease and negative surgical margins after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of Pathological and Oncologic Outcomes of Favorable Risk Gleason Score 3 + 4 and Low Risk Gleason Score 6 Prostate Cancer: Considerations for Active Surveillance.', 'Impact of Stain Normalization on Pathologist Assessment of Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Study.', 'High-Throughput and Automated Acoustic Trapping of Extracellular Vesicles to Identify microRNAs With Diagnostic Potential for Prostate Cancer.', 'The new ISUP 2014/WHO 2016 prostate cancer grade group system: first résumé 5\xa0years after introduction and systemic review of the literature.', 'Grading of prostate cancer: a work in progress.']"""

The aim of this study was to reveal the critical long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs), microRNA (miRNAs) and mRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of PRAD.  Methods:   The level 3 mRNA and miRNA sequencing data of PRAD were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Using the edgeR package of R, the differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs), lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) and miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) between PRAD and normal tissues were screened. The Cox proportional hazards regression method in the survival package was used to select the lncRNAs significantly related to clinical characteristics. After the miRNA-lncRNA and miRNA-mRNA pairs were predicted, a regulatory network was constructed by the Cytoscape software. For the DEGs involved in the network, enrichment analysis was conducted by the Fisher algorithm.  Results:   Compared to the normal samples, 25 DE-lncRNAs, 1421 DEGs and 68 DE-miRNAs were identified in the PRAD samples. The down-regulated MESTIT1 had a significantly negative correlation with overall survival. A total of 44 DE-miRNA-DE-lncRNA pairs were predicted, including the PCA3-miR-96 and UCA1-miR-96. Meanwhile, 33 DEGs targeted by miRNAs (for example, miR-96-CYP19A1) were found to correlate with cancers.  Conclusion:   Functional enrichment analysis showed that the reproductive development process (which involved TDRD1) was enriched for the DEGs implicated in the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network.

This study establishes the role of microRNA 301a (miR-301a) as a supplemental biomarker that can distinguish between patients with benign prostate hyperplasia and clinically significant CaP. We evaluate the ability of miR-301a to predict the adverse pathology of CaP.  Methods:   In the first cohort, serum and prostate tumor samples were obtained from thirteen patients with Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), twelve patients with Gleason 6, and sixteen patients with Gleason 7 prostate adenocarcinoma. In the second cohort, 40 prostatectomy cases were selected (BPH:12, Gleason 6:12 and Gleason 7:16). MiRNA was extracted from serum and tumor samples. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for detection of miR-301a. To understand the molecular role of miR-301a, we performed cell viability, Western blots, promoter analysis, overexpression, and silencing studies in BPH and DU-145 cell lines.  Results:   MiR-301a demonstrated a significantly higher expression in both serum and tumor tissue in patients with CaP when compared to patients with BPH (P = 0.011 and 0.013 for serum and tissue expression, respectively). Expression of miR-301a in prostatectomy specimens correlated with increased Gleason score. We demonstrated that miR-301a inhibited the pro-apoptotic function of RUNX3, and activated ROCK1-mediated pro-survival signal in CaP. Silencing miR-301a initiated the pro-apoptotic function of RUNX3 by inhibiting ROCK1 expression in CaP cells.  Conclusions:   Expression of miR-301a could be a valuable adjunct tool for stratifying patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen, as well as those diagnosed with CaP.

Because of this, PARP-1 has been targeted for therapy in PC, and non-invasive imaging of PARP-1 could help predict which patients are likely to respond to such therapy. Several PARP-1 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents have been developed and show promise for imaging PARP-1 expression in breast, brain, and lung cancer in small animals, but not as yet in prostate cancer. [18F]WC-DZ-F is an analogue of [18F]FluorThanatrace (FTT) and [125I]KX1, which are well-established PARP-1 ligands for measuring PARP-1 expression. Herein, we evaluated the potential of [18F]WC-DZ-F for the imaging PARP-1 expression in PC.  Methods:   [18F]WC-DZ-F was synthesized by a two-step sequence. [18F]WC-DZ-F was evaluated by in vitro uptake studies in PC-3 cells and by in vivo biodistribution and microPET imaging using PC-3 tumor xenografts. Ex vivo autoradiography of PC-3 tumors after microPET imaging was also performed.  Results:   [18F]WC-DZ-F has high, PARP-1-specific uptake in PC-3 cells. In the microPET imaging study, [18F]WC-DZ-F accumulated in PC-3 xenograft tumors over 2 h, and the uptake was significantly reduced by blocking with olaparib. PC-3 tumors were clearly visualized in microPET images, and the imaging results were further confirmed by autoradiography of PC-3 tumors ex vivo. In the biodistribution study [18F]WC-DZ-F washed out quickly from most tissues within 2 h, except for the liver in which the uptake was not blockable by olaparib.  Conclusions:   We synthesized a novel PARP-1 radioligand, [18F]WC-DZ-F. The preliminary evaluation of [18F]WC-DZ-F indicates that it is a suitable PET imaging agent for measuring PARP-1 expression in prostate cancer and should be applicable to other types of cancers.""","""['Dong Zhou', 'Jinbin Xu', 'Cedric Mpoy', 'Wenhua Chu', 'Sung Hoon Kim', 'Huifangjie Li', 'Buck E Rogers', 'John A Katzenellenbogen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Solid phase radiosynthesis of an olaparib derivative using 4-18F fluorobenzoic acid and in vivo evaluation in breast and prostate cancer xenograft models for PARP-1 expression.', 'Synthesis and radiopharmacological evaluation of a high-affinity and metabolically stabilized 18F-labeled bombesin analogue for molecular imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-expressing prostate cancer.', 'First (18)F-labeled ligand for PET imaging of uPAR: in vivo studies in human prostate cancer xenografts.', 'The Development of 18F Fluorthanatrace: A PET Radiotracer for Imaging Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1.', 'Fluorine-18: A radionuclide with diverse range of radiochemistry and synthesis strategies for target based PET diagnosis.', 'Sulfonyl fluorides as targets and substrates in the development of new synthetic methods.', 'Preclinical Efficacy of a PARP-1 Targeted Auger-Emitting Radionuclide in Prostate Cancer.', '18FTosyl fluoride as a versatile 18Ffluoride source for the preparation of 18F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases as PET imaging targets for central nervous system diseases.', 'Solid phase radiosynthesis of an olaparib derivative using 4-18F fluorobenzoic acid and in vivo evaluation in breast and prostate cancer xenograft models for PARP-1 expression.']"""

The aim of present study was to determine the potential effects of GADD45β deletion on prostate hyperplasia progression.  Main methods:   LNCaP cells were incubated with testosterone propionate (1 μM) for 48 h and specific siRNA used to suppress GADD45β expression in vitro. For in vivo experiments, testosterone (3 mg/kg, IP) was injected into wild-type (WT) and GADD45β knockout (GADD45β-/-) C57BL/6J mice for 21 consecutive days, and serum and prostate tissues subjected to biological and histochemical analyses.  Key findings:   GADD45β-silenced LNCaP cells showed suppressed testosterone-induced 5α-reductase 2 and androgen receptor expression compared to control LNCaP cells. Moreover, after 21 days of testosterone treatment, prostate weight and stromal tissue increment were relatively lower in GADD45β-/- than WT counterpart mice. Inhibition of testosterone-induced 5α-reductase 2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression in the GADD45β-/- group was confirmed via immunohistochemistry analyses.  Significance:   Although the exact correlation between GADD45β and prostate hyperplasia remains to be established, the present GADD45βdeletion suppressed testosterone-induced prostate hyperplasia which was accompanied by inhibition of 5α-reductase 2-related protein expression.""","""['Se-Ra Park', 'Da-Young Jung', 'Tae-Won Kim', 'Chul-Ho Lee', 'Ju-Young Jung']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 silencing aggravates hormone-induced prostatic hyperplasia in mice.', 'Quisqualis indica Improves Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia by Regulating Prostate Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis.', 'Protective effects of combination of Stauntonia hexaphylla and Cornus officinalis on testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia through inhibition of 5α- reductase type 2 and induced cell apoptosis.', '5alpha-reductase inhibitors in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer risk reduction.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.']"""

Unfortunately, the current methods for diagnosis of bladder and prostate cancers, two most common urothelial malignancies, suffer from a low sensitivity and specificity. MicroRNAs, as a group of endogenously produced non-coding RNAs, regulate gene expression and their expression is observed to be altered in many cancers and cancer progression phenomena. The remarkable stability of microRNAs in biofluids and their unique expression pattern in different pathological conditions make them an appealing, noninvasive diagnostic method in cancer diagnosis. Our objective is to identify microRNAs as biomarkers in urine samples of bladder and prostate cancers to improve the existing diagnostic methods in this field.  Materials and methods:   In this study, urine samples from 110 men with either bladder (n = 45) or prostate (n = 23) cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 22) and healthy controls (n = 20) were collected. qPCR was used to evaluate the expression level of miR-21-5p, miR-141-3p, and miR-205-5p in these samples. The sensitivity and specificity of these microRNAs were determined using ROC curve analysis.  Results:   The analysis of the data revealed that miR-21-5p, miR-141-3p, and miR-205-5p are differentially expressed in urine of bladder and prostate cancer patients. All these three microRNAs were upregulated in these samples and they were also able to differentiate benign prostatic hyperplasia from malignant cases. The statistical analyses revealed a good specificity for each individual microRNA.  Conclusion:   The results show that these three urine-based microRNAs might be a good choice to implement a specific and non-invasive diagnostic tool for bladder and prostate cancer. The expression pattern of all three microRNAs was particularly useful to distinguish benign and invasive tumors in prostate cases. From the patients' perspective the improvement of the diagnostic situation is awaited eagerly.""","""['Nassim Ghorbanmehr', 'Sedigheh Gharbi', 'Eberhard Korsching', 'Mahmood Tavallaei', 'Behzad Einollahi', 'Seyed Javad Mowla']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['MicroRNAs in tumor samples and urinary extracellular vesicles as a putative diagnostic tool for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'Urinary exosomal microRNA-96-5p and microRNA-183-5p expression as potential biomarkers of bladder cancer.', 'Urinary micro-RNA expressions and protein concentrations may differentiate bladder cancer patients from healthy controls.', 'Urine microRNAs as potential noninvasive biomarkers in urologic cancers.', 'Assessment of miR-98-5p, miR-152-3p, miR-326 and miR-4289 Expression as Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Genomic and Phenotypic Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Guidance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Urinary MicroRNAs as Biomarkers of Urological Cancers: A Systematic Review.', 'Design of a printed electrochemical strip towards miRNA-21 detection in urine samples: optimization of the experimental procedures for real sample application.', 'DSCR9/miR-21-5p axis inhibits pancreatic cancer proliferation and resistance to gemcitabine via BTG2 signaling.', 'Urinary miRNAs as a Diagnostic Tool for Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

Loss of PTEN has been considered as one of the major factors leading to the origin of prostate cancer through modulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In this study, we have prepared a multifunctional antioxidant nanoliposome containing PTEN plasmid and cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeNPs). The efficient delivery of PTEN plasmid to human prostate cancer cells (PC-3) leads to restoration of the expression of lost PTEN protein in the cell cytoplasm. The delivered superoxide dismutase (SOD)-mimetic CeNPs were also found to decrease the cytoplasmic free radical levels in prostate cancer cells. The above two activities induced DNA fragmentation and micronucleus formation in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, it was also found that these multifunctional antioxidant nanoliposomes inhibit the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to negatively regulate the cell viability of prostate cancer cells.

Radium-223 (223Ra) is a calcium-mimetic alpha-particle emitter, which has been shown to have activity in prostate cancer with clinical benefit in patients with symptomatic bone metastasis. The recommended schedule is six cycles of 223Ra, 5 kBq/kg, at 4-weekly intervals. Although previous studies have assessed clinical outcomes in patients who received six cycles of Ra223, there is very little information about outcomes of patients receiving fewer courses of treatment.  Patients and methods:   Patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer treated from May 2014 to August 2016 were included in this retrospective study. A total of 113 patients were identified with a median age of 76 (range=52-92) years. The median number of cycles administered was 5 (range=1-6) with 54 (48%) completing six cycles of treatment. Eighty-five patients (75%) received 223Ra prior to docetaxel chemotherapy and 28 (25%) received it after receiving docetaxel.  Results:   Eleven patients developed grade 2/3 thrombocytopenia, and none of these received further 223Ra. Only 25% of patients who had a haemoglobin level of 10 g/dl or below at the start of the treatment were able to complete six courses of 223Ra. Of the patients who completed fewer than six cycles of 223Ra (1-5 cycles), the survival was 121 days, compared to 398 days in men who received six cycles (odds ratio(OR)=4.767, 95% confidence internal(CI)=1.07-21.25; p=0.0005).

Both drug resistance and inherent transition from melanocytic nevi to malignant melanoma involve the overexpression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and a B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) mutation.  Materials and methods:   In this work, the effects of an HDAC class I and II inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) on the whole transcriptome of SK-MEL-3 cells carrying a BRAF mutation was examined.  Results:   The data obtained show that TSA was an extremely potent HDAC inhibitor within SK-MEL-3 nuclear lysates, where TSA was then optimized for appropriate sub-lethal concentrations for in vitro testing. The whole-transcriptome profile shows a basic phenotype dominance in the SK-MEL-3 cell line for i) synthesis of melanin, ii) phagosome acidification, iii) ATP hydrolysis-coupled proton pumps and iv) iron transport systems. While TSA did not affect the aforementioned major systems, it evoked a dramatic change to the transcriptome: reflected by a down-regulation of 810 transcripts and up-regulation of 833, with fold-change from -15.27 to +31.1 FC (p<0.00001). Largest differentials were found for the following transcripts: Up-regulated: Tetraspanin 13 (TSPAN13), serpin family i member 1 (SERPINI1), ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit beta 2 (ATP1B2), nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyl transferase 2 (NMNAT2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like (PDGFRL), cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1), prostate androgen-regulated mucin-like protein 1 (PARM1), secretogranin II (SCG2), SYT11 (synaptotagmin 11), rhophilin associated tail protein 1 like (ROPN1L); down-regulated: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GALNT3), carbonic anhydrase 14 (CAXIV), BCL2-related protein A1 (BCL2A1), protein kinase C delta (PRKCD), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 1 (TRPM1), ubiquitin associated protein 1 like (UBAP1L), glutathione peroxidase 8 (GPX8), interleukin 16 (IL16), tumor protein p53 (TP53), and serpin family H member 1 (SERPINH1). There was no change to any of the HDAC transcripts (class I, II and IV), the sirtuin HDAC family (1-6) or the BRAF proto-oncogene v 599 transcripts. However, the data showed that TSA down-regulated influential transcripts that drive the BRAF-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 oncogenic pathway (namely PRKCD and MYC proto-oncogene which negatively affected the cell-cycle distribution. Mitotic inhibition was corroborated by functional pathway analysis and flow cytometry confirming halt at the G2 phase, occurring in the absence of toxicity.

CRPC growth is mediated mostly by androgen receptor signalling driven by primary androgens synthesised largely by the CYP17A1 enzyme.  Objective:   To evaluate the safety profile and dose-limiting toxicities of ODM-204.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this open, uncontrolled, nonrandomised, multicentre, tolerability and pharmacokinetic first-in-man phase I dose escalation study, patients with metastatic CRPC were randomised to receive ODM-204 in sequential cohorts of five dose levels (ie, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500mg twice daily) concomitantly with prednisone.  Intervention:   ODM-204, a novel, orally administered, investigational, nonsteroidal dual inhibitor of CYP17A1 and androgen receptor.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   ODM-204 plasma concentrations, serum testosterone, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were evaluated and imaging of lesions was performed.  Results and limitations:   Of the 23 patients enrolled into the study, 60.9% experienced mild adverse effects considered to be related to the study treatment, which were fatigue, increased/decreased appetite, nausea, asthenia, diarrhoea, and weight decrease. ODM-204 area under the curve (AUC0-12) values increased dose dependently until the 300mg dose. The AUC was lower on day 8 after repeated dosing compared with day 1 from the 200mg dose upwards. Decreases in testosterone levels were seen with ODM-204 treatment confirming androgen deprivation. Of the patients, 13% also demonstrated a >50% decrease in PSA at week 12 and continued ODM-204 treatment for over a year.  Conclusions:   ODM-204 was well tolerated up to the highest evaluated dose. There were decreases in both testosterone and PSA levels, suggesting preliminary antitumour activity in the treatment of CRPC. The pharmacokinetic properties of the molecule, however, prevent further development.  Patient summary:   This study looked at the safety of ODM-204, a novel dual inhibitor of CYP17A1 and the androgen receptor, in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. ODM-204 treatment was found to be well tolerated, and it also reduced both serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen levels, but the properties of the molecule prevent further development.""","""['Katriina J Peltola', 'Petri Bono', 'Robert Hugh Jones', 'Egils Vjaters', 'Pirjo Nykänen', 'Annamari Vuorela', 'Riikka Oksala', 'Pasi Pohjanjousi', 'Mika V J Mustonen', 'Karim Fizazi', 'Christophe Massard']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""[]"""

We analysed PSA bounce occurrence after combined high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) and external radiotherapy (ERT).  Material & methods:   We analysed 623 patients treated from 1995 to 2008. The median age was 66 years (47-79). The median initial PSA was 12 ng/ml (0.1-224). Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was given to 429 patients. ERT was given with 2 Gy fractions to 50 Gy and HDR-BT in two 10 Gy fractions. The median follow-up was 11 years (range 2-266 months). PSA bounce was defined as a temporary rise in PSA >0.2 ng/ml. PSA failure was defined according to the Phoenix definition.  Results:   PSA bounce occurred in 159 patients (26%), where 56 patients had a bounce amplitude >2 ng/ml and 31 patients had multiple bounces. Median time to bounce peak was 15 (3-103) months with a median bounce value of 1.5 (0.3-12)ng/ml. Younger age and lower Gleason scores were associated with PSA bounce. In a Cox regression analysis with PSA bounce as a time-dependent covariate and adjusted for other prognostic factors, PSA bounce was associated with a lower risk for PSA failure (HR = 0.42; 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.70).  Conclusion:   PSA bounce after HDR-BT combined with ERT is common and associated with a good prognosis. As the relapse risk after an early bounce is very low, the findings should alert clinicians not to initiate salvage treatment too early.

Although there has been extensive characterisation of the protein and nucleic acid component of EVs, their lipidome has received little attention and may represent a unique and untapped source of biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  Methods:   EVs were isolated from non-tumourigenic (RWPE1), tumourigenic (NB26) and metastatic (PC-3) prostate cell lines. Lipids were extracted and subsequently used for targeted lipidomics analysis for the quantitation of molecular lipid species.  Results:   A total of 187 molecular lipid species were quantitatively identified in EV samples showing differential abundance between RWPE1, NB26 and PC-3 EV samples. Fatty acids, glycerolipids and prenol lipids were more highly abundant in EVs from non-tumourigenic cells, whereas sterol lipids, sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids were more highly abundant in EVs from tumourigenic or metastatic cells.  Conclusions:   This study identified differences in the molecular lipid species of prostate cell-derived EVs, increasing our understanding of the changes that occur to the EV lipidome during prostate cancer progression.

Currently clinically approved small molecule inhibitors of AR, such as enzalutamide, are built upon a common chemical scaffold that interacts with the AR by the same mechanism of action. These inhibitors eventually fail due to the emergence of drug-resistance in the form of AR mutations and expression of truncated AR splice variants (e.g. AR-V7) that are constitutively active, signalling the progression of the castration-resistant state of the disease. The urgent need therefore continues for novel classes of AR inhibitors that can overcome drug resistance, especially since AR signalling remains important even in late-stage advanced PCa. Previously, we identified a collection of 10-benzylidene-10H-anthracen-9-ones that effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, induce AR degradation and display some ability to block recruitment of hormones to the receptor. In the current work, we extended the analysis of the lead compounds, and used methods of both ligand- and structure-based drug design to develop a panel of novel 10-benzylidene-10H-anthracen-9-one derivatives capable of suppressing transcriptional activity and protein expression levels of both full length- and AR-V7 truncated forms of human androgen receptor.

The presence of pre-existing MAGED4B and FJX1-specific T-cells was detected using a HLA-A2 dimer assay and efficacy of PV1 to induce T-cell to secrete cytotoxic cytokine was evaluated using ELISPOT assay. Pre-existing PV1-specific T-cells were detected in all patients. Notably, we demonstrated that patients' T-cells were able to secrete cytotoxic cytokines upon exposure to target cells expressing the respective antigen post PV1 stimulation. Furthermore, patients with high expression of MAGED4B and FJX1 in their tumours were more responsive to PV1 stimulation, demonstrating the specificity of the PV1 peptide vaccine.

However, to the authors' knowledge, it remains unclear whether threatening IPs that are consistent with disease severity are equally harmful. The aim of the current study was to: 1) identify subgroups of cancer survivors based on IPs and prognosis; and 2) assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and survival associated with these subgroups.  Methods:   The authors used survey data from the population-based Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) registry, which were collected between 2008 and 2015 and included 2457 cancer survivors who were <5 years after their cancer diagnosis (colon, rectal, prostate, endometrial, or ovarian cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Clinical and survival data were collected through the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Subgroups were defined by IPs (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire) and prognosis (conditional 5-year relative survival) into survivors with 1) IPs consistent with prognosis (""realistic""); 2) less threatening IPs than expected based on prognosis (""optimistic""); and 3) more threatening IPs than expected based on prognosis (""pessimistic"").  Results:   Compared with survivors with realistic IPs (1230 survivors), those with optimistic IPs (582 survivors) were found to have a higher HRQOL (P < .01 on all European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 [EORTC QLQ-C30] scales) and a lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.72; P < .01), whereas those with pessimistic IPs (645 survivors) had a lower HRQOL (P < .01 on all scales) and a higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.52; P < .01).  Conclusions:   Optimistic IPs are associated with better HRQOL and survival, even if they may appear to be unrealistic with respect to cancer survivors' prognosis. Survivors with pessimistic IPs appear to have the worst outcomes. Therefore, efforts are needed to provide better support to patients with pessimistic IPs to improve their outcomes.

FTs are considered to be enriched in cancer stem-like cells (CS-LCs). In this study, we used cancer cell lines (lung H460, prostate LnCAP, and breast MCF-7) able to form FSs under anchorage-independent conditions and compared with cell lines (prostate PC3 and breast MDA-MB-231) that cannot form FSs under similar conditions. Independent of their ability to form FTs all cell lines growing under anchorage-independent conditions become highly resistant to obatoclax, colchicine, and hydroxyurea. We used anti-E-cadherin antibody (that blocked the formation of FSs) and demonstrated that floating LnCAP cells showed similar chemoresistance regardless of the formation of spheroids. Our results demonstrate that the development of chemoresistance is not because of the formation of a complex 3D structure and/or enrichment of CS-LCs but is likely the result of cell detachment per se and their ability to survive under anchorage-independent conditions. We propose that FSs and FTs could be useful models to study chemoresistance of cancer cells associated with cell detachment (e.g., circulating tumor cells) but they may not be representative of other types of chemoresistance that arise in vivo in attached cells.""","""['Vivek Kaushik', 'Juan S Yakisich', 'Lillian Frances Way', 'Neelam Azad', 'Anand K V Iyer']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Chemoresistance of Lung and Breast Cancer Cells Growing Under Prolonged Periods of Serum Starvation.', 'Cancer Cell Plasticity: Rapid Reversal of Chemosensitivity and Expression of Stemness Markers in Lung and Breast Cancer Tumorspheres.', 'Pleiotropic effects of probenecid on three-dimensional cultures of prostate cancer cells.', 'Biological behavior of prostate cancer cells in 3D culture systems.', 'Application of Three-dimensional (3D) Tumor Cell Culture Systems and Mechanism of Drug Resistance.', 'Alternative models of cancer stem cells: The stemness phenotype model, 10 years later.', 'Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy for Monitoring Chemoresistance of Cancer Cells.', 'Agent-based modelling reveals strategies to reduce the fitness and metastatic potential of circulating tumour cell clusters.', 'A Model-System to Address the Impact of Phenotypic Heterogeneity and Plasticity on the Development of Cancer Therapies.']"""

No prospective study has examined the association between circulating IGF-I concentrations and melanoma risk. A nested case-control study of 1,221 melanoma cases and 1,221 controls was performed in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, a prospective cohort of 520,000 participants recruited from 10 European countries. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for incident melanoma in relation to circulating IGF-I concentrations, measured by immunoassay. Analyses were conditioned on the matching factors and further adjusted for age at blood collection, education, height, BMI, smoking status, alcohol intake, marital status, physical activity and in women only, use of menopausal hormone therapy. There was no significant association between circulating IGF-I concentration and melanoma risk (OR for highest vs lowest fifth = 0.93 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71 to 1.22]). There was no significant heterogeneity in the association between IGF-I concentrations and melanoma risk when subdivided by gender, age at blood collection, BMI, height, age at diagnosis, time between blood collection and diagnosis, or by anatomical site or histological subtype of the tumour (Pheterogeneity≥0.078).

We therefore examined the hypothesis that dose-escalated SBRT can be safely administered across multiple institutions, with favorable 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates compared with historical controls.  Methods and materials:   Twenty-one centers enrolled 309 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma: 172 with low-risk (LR) and 137 with intermediate-risk (IR) disease. All were treated with a non-coplanar robotic SBRT platform using real-time tracking of implanted fiducials. The prostate was prescribed 40 Gy in 5 fractions of 8 Gy. We assessed toxicities using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3 and biochemical failure using the ""nadir + 2"" definition. The study population yielded 90% power to identify excessive (>10%) rates of grade ≥3 genitourinary (GU) or gastrointestinal toxicities and, in the LR group, 80% power to show superiority in DFS over a 93% historical comparison rate.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 61 months, 2 LR patients (1.2%) and 2 IR patients (1.5%) experienced grade 3 GU toxicities, far below the 10% toxicity rate deemed excessive (upper limits of 95% confidence interval, 3.5% and 4.3%, respectively). No grade 4 or 5 toxicities occurred. All grade 3 toxicities were GU, occurring 11 to 51 months after treatment. For the entire group, the actuarial 5-year overall survival rate was 95.6% and the DFS rate was 97.1%. The 5-year DFS rate was 97.3% for LR patients (superior to the 93% DFS rate for historical controls; P = .0008; lower limit of 95% confidence interval, 94.6%) and 97.1% for IR patients.  Conclusions:   Dose-escalated prostate SBRT was administered with minimal toxicity in this multi-institutional study. Relapse rates compared favorably with historical controls.

Lenalidomide is an antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory agent with broad antitumor activity. We hypothesized that the modulation of the cellular immune response to apoptosis caused by ketoconazole may be increased with the addition of lenalidomide. Methods This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-arm phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of ketoconazole and lenalidomide in patients with CRPC. Treatment schema included standard ketoconazole 400 mg orally three times daily plus hydrocortisone orally (20 mg in the morning and 10 mg at night) in combination with lenalidomide 25 mg orally daily for 21 days in a 28-day cycle and aspirin 75 mg daily. The primary endpoint of this study was response (either by ≥ 50% PSA decline or objective disease assessed by RECIST v1.0). Exploratory endpoints included changes in T cell, dendritic cell (DC) marker counts, and their correlation with PSA response to treatment. Results A total of 34 CRPC patients, median age 69 years, 76% ECOG 0 and 76% with metastases participated in the study. Patients received a median of 2 cycles (range 1-35); nine patients (26%) received >10 cycles of treatment. PSA responses were observed in 17 patients (50%) with 11 patients (32%) achieving a PSA decline of >90%. Among the 9 patients with measurable disease, 2 patients (22%) had PR and 2 other (22%) had SD as best response. Median time to failure (TTF) was 2.7 months (range 0.2-32.8); and 8 patients were treated for ≥ 15 months. Most common adverse events included fatigue (76%), skin reactions (62%), lymphopenia (44%) and anemia (44%). One possible treatment-related death was noted. For 16 patients with available serial correlative data, there was a significant increase in the dendritic cells subsets BDCA-1 (+146.7, -20.1 to +501.1%, p = 0.018) and BDCA-3 (39.8%, -100 to 282.6%, p = 0.001) after 8 weeks of treatment. No association between immune cell counts and PSA response at 8 weeks was observed. Conclusion The combination of ketoconazole and lenalidomide was well tolerated but did not meet the primary endpoint of response, despite durable responses were observed in a selected group of patients. Although ketoconazole has now been replaced with more active novel agents, the combination of novel CYP-17 inhibitors with agents capable of modulating the immune system warrants further prospective investigation.

The aim of the study is to isolate which features of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomic analysis have to be considered the most significant predictors of metastasis in oncological patients with spinal bone marrow metastatic disease.  Materials and methods:   Eight oncological patients (3 lung cancer; 1 prostatic cancer; 1 esophageal cancer; 1 nasopharyngeal cancer; 1 hepatocarcinoma; 1 breast cancer) with pre-radiotherapy MR imaging for a total of 58 dorsal vertebral bodies, 29 metastatic and 29 non-metastatic were included. Each vertebral body was contoured in T1 and T2 weighted images at a radiotherapy delineation console. The obtained data were transferred to an automated data extraction system for morphological, statistical and textural analysis. Eighty-nine features for each lesion in both T1 and T2 images were computed as the median of by-slice values. A Wilcoxon test was applied to the 89 features and the most statistically significant of them underwent to a stepwise feature selection, to find the best performing predictors of metastasis in a logistic regression model. An internal cross-validation via bootstrap was conducted for estimating the model performance in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic.  Results:   Of the 89 textural features tested, 16 were found to differ with statistical significance in the metastatic vs non-metastatic group. The best performing model was constituted by two predictors for T1 and T2 images, namely one morphological feature (center of mass shift) (p value < 0.01) for both datasets and one histogram feature minimum grey level (p value < 0.01) for T1 images and one textural feature (grey-level co-occurrence matrix joint variance (p value < 0.01) for T2 images.

The importance of this treatment paradigm in prostate cancer is a rapidly evolving field. Herein, we report on the safety and preliminary clinical outcomes of a modern cohort of oligometastatic prostate cancer (OPC) patients treated with consolidative stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR).  Methods:   Records of men with OPC who underwent consolidative SABR at our institution were reviewed. SABR was delivered in 1-5 fractions of 5-18 Gray. Kaplan-Meier estimates of local progression-free survival (LPFS), biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS; PSA nadir + 2), distant progression-free survival (DPFS), and time-to-next intervention (TTNI) were calculated.  Results:   In total, 66 OPC patients were identified with consolidative SABR delivered to 134 metastases: 89 bone, 40 nodal, and 5 viscera. The majority of men (49/66) had hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC). Crude grade 1 and 2 acute toxicities were 36% and 11%, respectively, with no ≥ grade 3 toxicity. At 1 year, LPFS was 92% and bPFS and DPFS were 69%. Of the 18 men with HSPC who had deferred hormone therapy , 11 (56%) remain disease free following SABR (1-year ADT-FS was 78%). In 17 castration-resistant men, 11 had > 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declines with 1-year TTNI of 30%.  Conclusions:   Consolidative SABR in OPC is feasible and well tolerated. The heterogeneity and small size of our series limit extrapolation of clinically meaningful outcomes following consolidative SABR in OPC, but our preliminary data suggest that this approach warrants continued prospective study.""","""['C Leigh Moyer', 'Ryan Phillips', 'Matthew P Deek', 'Noura Radwan', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Diane Reyes', 'Jean Wright', 'Stephanie A Terezakis', 'Daniel Y Song', 'Curtiland DeVille', 'Patrick C Walsh', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Michael Carducci', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Mario Eisenberger', 'Phuoc T Tran']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'A phase II randomized trial of Observation versus stereotactic ablative RadiatIon for OLigometastatic prostate CancEr (ORIOLE).', 'Stereotactic Abative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Clinical Trial.', 'A phase II randomized trial of RAdium-223 dichloride and SABR Versus SABR for oligomEtastatic prostate caNcerS (RAVENS).', 'Radiotherapy in nodal oligorecurrent prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic radiotherapy for oligometastases in the lymph nodes.', 'Local Therapies in Oligometastatic and Oligoprogressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Efficacy of PSMA PET-Guided Radiotherapy for Oligometastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Distinct Outcomes of Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients after Distant Failure According to p16 Status: Implication in Therapeutic Options.', 'Patterns of Recurrence and Modes of Progression After Metastasis-Directed Therapy in Oligometastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.']"""

A surgical skill laboratory (SSL) was designed to educate urology trainees on surgical anatomy and techniques for NSRP. The objective was to assess the validity of a SSL program.  Methods:   A low-fidelity, anatomically accurate prostate model with its appropriate fascial coverings and location of the neurovascular bundle was created. Participants were surveyed prior to a SSL workshop for their knowledge of NSRP focusing on clinical and anatomical considerations. An interactive 2-h tutorial and workshop was then undertaken outlining the clinical and anatomical nuances for NSRP, with participants then practising an intra and inter-fascial NSRP on the model. Participants were resurveyed immediately after the workshop and at 6 months.  Results:   Thirty participants completed the NSRP workshop. Significant differences (p < 0.0001) in anatomical and clinical knowledge were noted after the workshop with improvements for both junior and senior trainees. The knowledge was retained at 6 months following the workshop.  Conclusions:   A low-fidelity bench-top model is a feasible and reproducible technique for improving the understanding of periprostatic anatomy and the different surgical approaches for NSRP. The SSL is useful and knowledge gained appears to be retained by workshop participants. SSL workshops are a valid hands-on approach to teaching surgical skills and should remain an integral part of urology training.""","""['Emma Clarebrough', 'Daniel Christidis', 'Uri Lindner', 'Kimberly Fernandes', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy--effect and risks.', 'Novel anatomical identification of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: fascial-sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Basic principles of anatomy for optimal surgical treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Incidence of positive surgical margins after biopsy-selected nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Technical aspects of nerve sparing during retropubic prostatectomy.', 'The Effect of Low-Frequency Electrical Stimulation Combined With Anus Lifting Training on Urinary Incontinence After Radical Prostatectomy in a Chinese Cohort.', 'A newly developed porcine training model for transurethral piecemeal and en bloc resection of bladder tumour.']"""

Patients and methods:   366 patients received RT for PCa. In total, 49.2% received definitive RT, 20.2% received postoperative RT and 30.6% received salvage RT for biochemical recurrence. In 77.9% of patients, RT was delivered to the prostate or prostate bed, and additional whole pelvic RT was performed in 22.1%. 33.9% received 3D-RT, and 66.1% received IMRT. The median follow-up was 59.5 months (18.0-84.0 months). The relative (in %) and absolute (in ccm) rectal doses from 20-75 Gy including the receiver operating characteristics curves (rAUC) from 30-65 Gy (in % and ccm) and several other clinical parameters were analyzed in univariate and multivariate analyses. We performed the statistical analyses separately for the entire cohort (n = 366), patients with (n = 81) and without (n = 285) pelvic RT, comparing RP vs. RP ≥ grade I.  Results:   With the exception of the V50Gyccm (p = 0.02) in the univariate analyses for acute RP in the entire patient cohort, no absolute DV parameter (in ccm) was statistically significant associated with either acute or late RP. In the multivariate analyses, 3D-RT (p < 0.008) and rAUCV30-50 Gy% (p = 0.006) were significant parameters for acute RP for the entire cohort, and the V50Gy% (p = 0.01) was the significant parameter for patients with pelvic RT. The rAUCV40-50 Gy% (p = 0.004) was significant for RT to the prostate/prostate bed. Regarding the statistical analysis for late RP, the rAUCV30-65 Gy% (p = 0.001) was significant for the entire cohort, and rAUCV30-50 Gy% (p = 0.001) was significant for RT of the prostate/prostate bed.

We found that within individual patients, a large majority of driver gene mutations are common to all metastases. Further analysis revealed that the driver gene mutations that were not shared by all metastases are unlikely to have functional consequences.

However, the impact of diet modifications on the tumor microenvironment and antitumor immunity is not well defined. Immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are associated with poor clinical outcomes and are potentially modifiable through dietary interventions. We tested the hypothesis that dietary protein restriction modifies macrophage function toward antitumor phenotypes.  Experimental design:   Macrophage functional status under different tissue culture conditions and in vivo was assessed by Western blot, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and cytokine array analyses. Tumor growth in the context of protein or amino acid (AA) restriction and immunotherapy, namely, a survivin peptide-based vaccine or a PD-1 inhibitor, was examined in animal models of prostate (RP-B6Myc) and renal (RENCA) cell carcinoma. All tests were two-sided.  Results:   Protein or AA-restricted macrophages exhibited enhanced tumoricidal, proinflammatory phenotypes, and in two syngeneic tumor models, protein or AA-restricted diets elicited reduced TAM infiltration, tumor growth, and increased response to immunotherapies. Further, we identified a distinct molecular mechanism by which AA-restriction reprograms macrophage function via a ROS/mTOR-centric cascade.  Conclusions:   Dietary protein restriction alters TAM activity and enhances the tumoricidal capacity of this critical innate immune cell type, providing the rationale for clinical testing of this supportive tool in patients receiving cancer immunotherapies.""","""['Ashley Orillion', 'Nur P Damayanti', 'Li Shen', 'Remi Adelaiye-Ogala', 'Hayley Affronti', 'May Elbanna', 'Sreenivasulu Chintala', 'Michael Ciesielski', 'Luigi Fontana', 'Chinghai Kao', 'Bennett D Elzey', 'Timothy L Ratliff', 'David E Nelson', 'Dominic Smiraglia', 'Scott I Abrams', 'Roberto Pili']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Targeting TFE3-fusion translocation RCC.', 'Progress in tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-targeted therapeutics.', 'Cancer-Stimulated CAFs Enhance Monocyte Differentiation and Protumoral TAM Activation via IL6 and GM-CSF Secretion.', 'Tumor cells induce LAMP2a expression in tumor-associated macrophage for cancer progression.', 'Tumor cell-released autophagosomes (TRAPs) promote immunosuppression through induction of M2-like macrophages with increased expression of PD-L1.', 'Diverse macrophages polarization in tumor microenvironment.', 'Dietary Manipulation of Amino Acids for Cancer Therapy.', 'PI3K/AKT/mTOR Dysregulation and Reprogramming Metabolic Pathways in Renal Cancer: Crosstalk with the VHL/HIF Axis.', 'Increased response to immune checkpoint inhibitors with dietary methionine restriction.', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors for Solid Tumors in the Adjuvant Setting: Current Progress, Future Directions, and Role in Transplant Oncology.', 'The Microbiome-TIME Axis: A Host of Possibilities.']"""

We aimed to determine the interobserver agreement for applying PSMA-RADS to imaging interpretation of 18F-DCFPyL (2-(3-{1-carboxy-5-[(6-18F-fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid) PET examinations in a prospective setting mimicking the typical clinical workflow at a prostate cancer referral center. Methods: Four readers (2 experienced readers (ERs, >3 y of PSMA-targeted PET interpretation experience) and 2 inexperienced readers (IRs, <1 y of experience)), who had all read the initial publication on PSMA-RADS 1.0, assessed 50 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT studies independently. Per scan, a maximum of 5 target lesions was selected by the observers, and a PSMA-RADS score for every target lesion was recorded. No specific preexisting conditions were placed on the selection of the target lesions, although PSMA-RADS 1.0 suggests that readers focus on the most avid or largest lesions. An overall scan impression based on PSMA-RADS was indicated, and interobserver agreement rates on a target lesion-based, on an organ-based, and on an overall PSMA-RADS score-based level were computed. Results: The number of target lesions identified by each observer was as follows: ER 1, 123; ER 2, 134; IR 1, 123; and IR 2, 120. Among those selected target lesions, 125 were chosen by at least 2 individual observers (all 4 readers selected the same target lesion in 58 of 125 [46.4%] instances, 3 readers in 40 of 125 [32%], and 2 observers in 27 of 125 [21.6%]). The interobserver agreement for PSMA-RADS scoring among identical target lesions was good (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] for 4, 3, and 2 identical target lesions, ≥0.60, respectively). For lymph nodes, an excellent interobserver agreement was derived (ICC, 0.79). The interobserver agreement for an overall scan impression based on PSMA-RADS was also excellent (ICC, 0.84), with a significant difference for ER (ICC, 0.97) vs. IR (ICC, 0.74) (P = 0.005).

The PSMA reporting and data system version 1.0 (PSMA-RADS version 1.0) categorizes lesions on the basis of the likelihood of PCa involvement, with PSMA-RADS-3A (soft-tissue) and PSMA-RADS-3B (bone) lesions being indeterminate for the presence of disease. We retrospectively reviewed the imaging follow-up of such lesions to determine the rate at which they underwent changes suggestive of underlying PCa. Methods: PET/CT imaging with 18F-DCFPyL was performed in 110 patients with PCa, and lesions were categorized according to PSMA-RADS version 1.0. The study reported herein is a retrospective analysis of those patients. Fifty-six of 110 (50.9%) patients were determined to have indeterminate PSMA-RADS-3A or PSMA-RADS-3B lesions, and 22 of 56 (39.3%) patients had adequate follow-up to be included in the analysis (median follow-up time was 10 mo [range, 3-22 mo]). The SUVmax of the lesions was obtained, and the ratios of SUVmax of the lesions to SUVmean of blood pool (SUVmax-lesion/SUVmean-bloodpool) were calculated. Predetermined criteria were used to evaluate the PSMA-RADS-3A and PSMA-RADS-3B lesions on follow-up imaging to determine whether they demonstrated evidence of underlying malignancy. Results: A total of 46 lesions in 22 patients were considered indeterminate for PCa (i.e., PSMA-RADS-3A [32 lesions] or PSMA-RADS-3B [14 lesions]) and were evaluable on follow-up imaging. Twenty-seven of 46 (58.7%) lesions demonstrated changes suggesting they were true-positive for PCa. These lesions included 24 of 32 (75.0%) PSMA-RADS-3A lesions and 3 of 14 (21.4%) lesions categorized as PSMA-RADS-3B. The ranges of SUVmax and SUVmax-lesion/SUVmean-bloodpool overlapped between those lesions demonstrating changes consistent with malignancy on follow-up imaging and those lesions that remained unchanged on follow-up. The presence of additional definitive sites of PCa (PSMA-RADS-4 and PSMA-RADS-5) increases the likelihood that indeterminate lesions will manifest as true-positive on follow-up imaging. Conclusion: PSMA-RADS-3A and PSMA-RADS-3B lesions are truly indeterminate in that proportions of findings in both categories demonstrate evidence of malignancy on follow-up imaging. Overall, PSMA-RADS-3A lesions are more likely than PSMA-RADS-3B lesions to represent sites of PCa, and this information should be considered when guiding patient therapy.""","""['Yafu Yin', 'Rudolf A Werner', 'Takahiro Higuchi', 'Constantin Lapa', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Michael A Gorin', 'Steven P Rowe']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prospective Comparison of PET Imaging with PSMA-Targeted 18F-DCFPyL Versus Na18F for Bone Lesion Detection in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Effect of Point-Spread Function Reconstruction for Indeterminate PSMA-RADS-3A Lesions on PSMA-Targeted PET Imaging of Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'PET imaging of prostate-specific membrane antigen in prostate cancer: current state of the art and future challenges.', 'PSMA PET and Radionuclide Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA PET imaging in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.', 'PET Criteria by Cancer Type from Imaging Interpretation to Treatment Response Assessment: Beyond FDG PET Score.', 'PSMA PET/CT: joint EANM procedure guideline/SNMMI procedure standard for prostate cancer imaging 2.0.', 'Association of True Positivity with Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels and Other Clinical Factors in Indeterminate PSMA-RADS-3A Lesions Identified on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Scans.', 'Changing Threshold-Based Segmentation Has No Relevant Impact on Semi-Quantification in the Context of Structured Reporting for PSMA-PET/CT.']"""

We performed a national survey of radiation oncologists and urologists on their perceptions and self-reported use of genetic testing.  Methods:   From January to July 2017, a 4-wave mail survey was performed involving 915 radiation oncologists and 940 urologists about genetic testing and decision-making for localized prostate cancer. The survey queried the frequency and type of genetic test and the degree of importance and confidence of such tests. Pearson chi-square and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify respondent characteristics associated with outcomes.  Results:   Overall response rate was 37.3% (n = 691). One in six specialists reported frequently using genetic tests with urologists more likely than radiation oncologists to do so (26% vs. 4%; OR: 3.51, p < 0.001) and their perceived higher importance (46% vs. 20%; adjusted OR: 3.51, p < 0.001) as well as their confidence in doing so (70% vs. 39%; OR: 3.81, p < 0.001) for decision-making for localized prostate cancer.

Although several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed susceptibility genes associated with gastric cancer, no GWASs have been conducted in the Korean population, which has the highest incidence of gastric cancer.  Materials and methods:   We performed genome scanning of 450 gastric cancer cases and 1,134 controls via Affymetrix Axiom Exome 319 arrays, followed by replication of 803 gastric cancer cases and 3,693 healthy controls.  Results:   We showed that the rs2976394 in the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) gene is a gastriccancer-susceptibility gene in a Korean population, with genome-wide significance and an odds ratio (OR) of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.77). A strong linkage disequilibrium with rs2294008 was also found, indicating an association with susceptibility. Individuals with the CC genotype of the PSCA gene showed an approximately 2-fold lower risk of gastric cancer compared to those with the TT genotype (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.57).

Accordingly, whether these two models could be applied to metastatic non-clear cell RCC (mNCCRCC) as well has not been well-known and was investigated herein.  Materials and methods:   From the Korean metastatic RCC registry, a total of 156 patients (8.1%) with mNCCRCC among the entire cohort of 1,922 patients were analyzed.

Results:   The median first-line PFS, total PFS, and CSS were 5, 6, and 24 months, respectively. The IMDC risk model reliably discriminated three risk groups to predict survival: the median firstline PFS, total PFS, and CSS for the favorable, intermediate, and poor risk groups were 9, 5, and, 2 months (p=0.001); 14, 7, and 2 months (p < 0.001); and 41, 21, and 8 months (p < 0.001), all respectively.

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6%), prostate cancer (7.1%), and colorectal cancer (6.1%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2%), stomach cancer (8.2%), and liver cancer (8.2%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries.

Effects of BMI trajectories on prostate cancer (PCa) risk have not been thoroughly explored.  Methods:   Cohort data were derived from electronic medical records of patients who were admitted to a tertiary-care hospital in the Southeastern USA during 1994-2016. Patients with a history of urologic clinic visit because of any prostatic condition and with repeatedly measured BMI (n = 4857) were included. BMI trajectories prior to PCa diagnosis were assessed using the developmental trajectory analysis method. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall and grade-specific PCa.  Results:   The median age (interquartile range, IQR) of the participants at baseline was 63 (54, 72) years. Over a median follow-up (IQR) of 8.0 (2.0, 13.0) years, 714 (14.7%, 714/4857) were diagnosed with PCa. Men with growing BMI trajectory progressing from normal weight to overweight/obese had a 76% increased PCa risk (aHR = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.25, 2.48), and men being obese and experiencing progressive weight gain had 3.72-fold increased PCa risk (aHR = 3.72; 95% CI: 1.60, 8.66), compared to men with persistently normal BMI. The associations were more pronounced for PCa with Gleason score ≥7. No significant association of decreasing BMI trajectory progressing from obese to normal BMI was found with PCa risk.

Materials and methods:   We conducted a retrospective study on the clinical data of 165 patients with low risk prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent nerve sparing LRP. All the patients included had normal preoperative uri-nary and sexual function. The association of prostate weight with perioperative data was assessed using Spearman correlation coefficient. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed to identify prognostic predictors for continence and potency recovery.  Results:   Increased prostate weight was significantly associated with older age, higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA), lower biopsy and pathological T stage and Gleason score, longer operative time, and higher estimated blood loss (P < .05). The continence rates at the 3rd, 6th, and 12th month after surgery were 63.6% (105/165), 87.9% (145/165), and 95.8% (158/165); and the potency rates were 44.8% (74/165), 62.4% (103/165) and 77.6% (128/165), respectively. Furthermore, multivariate Cox analysis showed that patient age (HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.35- 0.76) and prostate weight (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.86) were independent predictors for continence recovery, while only patient age (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45-0.96) could independently predict potency recovery.  Conclusion:   Larger prostate size was correlated with older age, higher PSA, lower tumor stage and grade, longer operative time, and more intraoperative blood loss in low risk PCa patients. Increased prostate weight may inde-pendently predict poor continence recovery after nerve sparing LRP.""","""['Dong-Gen Jiang', 'Chu-Tian Xiao', 'Yun-Hua Mao', 'Jian-Guang Qiu', 'Jie Si-Tu', 'Min-Hua Lu', 'Xin Gao']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['The role of waterjet dissection in improving erectile function and continence after nerve-sparing prostatectomy.', 'Do we need the nerve sparing radical prostatectomy techniques (intrafascial vs. interfascial) in men with erectile dysfunction?

A Multicentric Study Based on Pathologic Confirmation from Salvage Lymphadenectomy""","""Background:   A 11C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan is used for restaging prostate cancer (PCa) patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR). Only a few reports have focused on the correlation between PET/CT and nodal relapse location at pathologic examination.  Objective:   To assess the accuracy of PET/CT in predicting the site of nodal relapses in patients undergoing pelvic and/or retroperitoneal salvage lymph node dissection (sLND).  Design, setting, and participants:   Multicentric retrospective study including 106 patients with BCR of PCa after radical treatment; all patients but six had a PET/CT showing at least one nodal recurrence and received sLND.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PET/CT results were compared with histologic findings and analyzed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Multivariable regression analyses were performed.  Results and limitations:   Overall sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value, and accuracy of PET/CT for disease location were 61.6%, 79.3%, 66.3%, 75.7%, and 70.2%, respectively. Sensitivity was 75.5% in the lower pelvis with 69.8% specificity. The retroperitoneal region had high specificity (94.7%) but a relatively low sensitivity (58.3%). The sLNDs did not find any positive nodes in 16 patients (15%). According to regression analyses, discriminative accuracy of PET/CT was 70.4% and improved with an increased number of dissected nodes and prostate-specific antigen doubling time <12 mo. Limitations include retrospective design and lack of a standardized sLND template followed for all patients.  Conclusions:   The ability of PET/CT to detect nodal relapses is limited by a high false-positive rate, particularly in the iliac-obturator region and, more alarmingly, a high false-negative rate in the common iliac, sacral, and retroperitoneal regions. An extended template including pelvic and retroperitoneal regions should be adopted when sLND is planned for curative intent.  Patient summary:   The 11C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan is a commonly used tool to restage prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence, showing an overall per patient accuracy >80%; however, its ability to detect the site of nodal relapses remains suboptimal.""","""['Marco Oderda', 'Steven Joniau', 'Anna Palazzetti', 'Marco Falcone', 'Guglielmo Melloni', 'Hannes Van Den Bossche', 'Steven Deconinck', 'Fabio Zattoni', 'Robert Jeffrey Karnes', 'Paolo Gontero']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Pelvic/retroperitoneal salvage lymph node dissection for patients treated with radical prostatectomy with biochemical recurrence and nodal recurrence detected by 11Ccholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography.', 'Long-term outcomes of salvage lymph node dissection for clinically recurrent prostate cancer: results of a single-institution series with a minimum follow-up of 5 years.', 'Assessing the Best Surgical Template at Salvage Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection for Nodal Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: When Can Bilateral Dissection be Omitted?

Inhibition of metastasis is expected to be a promising approach for prostate cancer therapy. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is reported to be closely involved in cell growth, migration, etc. Objective: The study investigated the antimetastatic activities of pan-PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 on DU145 cells.  Methods:   1. The In vitro effect of ZSTK474 on the migration, invasion and adhesion of DU145 cells was determined with Transwell migration assay and wound healing assay, Tranwell invasion assay and adhesion assay, respectively. 2. In vitro effect of ZSTK474 on the signal proteins in DU145 cells was determined with Western blot analysis and ELISA. 3. Moreover, the In vivo antimetastatic effect of ZSTK474 was evaluated with MicroCT and histology analysis.  Results:   ZSTK474 potently attenuated the capability of migration, invasion and adhesion of DU145 cells, negatively regulated Girdin, Integrinβ1 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In addition, the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are known to be related to angiogenesis and metastasis, was also inhibited. Oral administration of ZSTK474 (200 mg/kg) ameliorated in vivo bone metastasis of DU145 cells, with improved bone structure and bone mineral density (BMD). Tissue staining indicated a reduction in metastatic DU145 cells and osteoclasts in the bones of ZSTK474-treated mice, compared with the non-treated group.

Methods and materials:   Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prospectively isolated from 37 patients with OPCa (≤3 metastases) who were treated with mdSBRT. Immunophenotyping identified circulating CD8+ T-cell subpopulations, including tumor-reactive (TTR), effector memory, central memory (TCM), effector, and naïve T cells from samples collected before and after mdSBRT. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess whether changes in these T-cell subpopulations were potential risk factors for death and/or progression. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival. Cumulative incidence for progression and new distant metastasis weas estimated, considering death as a competing risk.  Results:   Median follow-up was 39 months (interquartile range, 34-43). Overall survival at 3 years was 78.2%. Cumulative incidence for local progression and new distant metastasis at 3 years was 16.5% and 67.6%, respectively. Between baseline and day 14 after mdSBRT, an increase in the TCM cell subpopulation was associated with the risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.22 [95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.47]; P = .033), and an increase in the TTR cell subpopulation was protective against the risk of local progression (hazard ratio, 0.80 [95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.98]; P = .032).  Conclusions:   An increase in the TTR cell subpopulation was protective against the risk of disease progression, and an increase in the TCM cell subpopulation was associated with the risk of death in patients with OPCa treated with mdSBRT.

Correlations of methylation status and various clinicopathological features were evaluated. Six genes tested achieved significant difference in DNA methylation levels between the PCa compared to control cases (P < 0.05). The TIMP3 loci demonstrated significant correlation of DNA methylation with age for all cases analyzed (p < 0.05). We observed an inverse correlation between CDH13 methylation (p = 0.045; r = -0.21) and serum vitamin D level whereas TIMP3 methylation (p = 0.021; r = -0.24) and DRD2 methylation (p = 0.056; r = -0.201) showed inverse correlation with supplementary vitamin D in the cancer cases.

To assess ICA-1s as a possible therapeutic, in-vivo studies using a murine model were performed. ICA-1s was tested for stability in blood serum and results demonstrated that ICA-1s was stable in human plasma at 25 and 37°C over a course of 2 h. Toxicity of ICA-1s was tested for both acute and subacute exposure. The acute exposure showed patient surviving after 48 h of doses ranging from 5 to 5000 mg/kg. Subacute tests exposed the patients to 14 days of treatment and were followed by serum and tissue collection. Aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, troponin, and C-reactive protein serum levels were measured to assess organ function. ICA-1s in plasma serum was measured over the course of 24 h for both oral and intravenous treatments. Heart, liver, kidney, and brain tissues were analyzed for accumulation of ICA-1s. Finally, athymic nude mice were xenografted with DU-145 prostate cancer cells. After tumors reached ~0.2 cm, they were either treated with ICA-1s or left as control and measured for 30 days or until the tumor reached 2 cm. Results showed tumors in treated mice grew at almost half the rate as untreated tumors, showing a significant reduction in growth.

We sought to identify predictive and prognostic variables for overall survival (OS) in chemotherapy-naïve men with mCRPC treated with enzalutamide.  Patients and methods:   Patients from the PREVAIL trial database (enzalutamide versus placebo) were randomly split 2 : 1 into training (n = 1159) and testing (n = 550) sets. Using the training set, 23 predefined variables were analyzed and a multivariable model predicting OS was developed and validated in an independent testing set.  Results:   Patient characteristics and outcomes were well balanced between training and testing sets; median OS was 32.7 months in each. The final validated multivariable model included 11 independent prognostic variables. Median OS for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups (testing set) defined by prognostic risk tertiles were not yet reached (NYR) (95% CI NYR-NYR), 34.2 months (31.5-NYR), and 21.1 months (17.5-25.0), respectively. Hazard ratios (95% CI) for OS in the low- and intermediate-risk groups versus high-risk group were 0.20 (0.14-0.29) and 0.40 (0.30-0.53), respectively. Secondary outcomes of response and progression differed widely in model-defined risk groups. Enzalutamide improved outcomes in all prognostic risk groups.  Conclusions:   Our validated prognostic model incorporates variables routinely collected in chemotherapy-naïve men with mCRPC treated with enzalutamide, identifying subsets of patients with widely differing survival outcomes that provide useful information for external validation, patient care, and clinical trial design.

We investigated whether host or tumor GPR120 plays a role in the anti-prostate cancer effects of ω-3 FAs.  Methods:   MycCap prostate cancer allografts were grown in immunocompetent wild-type (WT) and GPR120 knockout (KO) mice fed ω-3 (fish oil) or ω-6 (corn oil) diets. Immune cell infiltration was quantified by flow cytometry, and gene expression of immune cell markers in isolated tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Archived tissue from a fish oil intervention trial was used to correlate gene expression of GPR120 with cell cycle progression (CCP) genes and Ki67 index (n = 11-15 per group). All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   In WT mice (n = 7 per group), dietary ω-3 FAs decreased MycCap allograft tumor growth (mean [SD] final tumor volume ω-6 = 491 [437] mm3 vs ω-3 = 127 [77] mm3, P = .04), whereas in global GPR120KO mice (n = 7 per group) ω-3 FAs had no anticancer effects. Dietary ω-3 FAs inhibited GPR120KO-MycCaP allografts grown in WT mice (n = 8 per group; mean [SD] final tumor volume ω-6 = 776 [767] mm3 vs ω-3 = 36 [34] mm3, P = .02). Omega-3 FA treatment decreased the number of M2-like TAMs in tumor tissue and gene expression of M2 markers in isolated TAMs compared with ω-6 controls in WT (n = 7 per group) but not in GPR120KO mice (n = 7 per group). In human tissue, higher expression of stromal GPR120 correlated with greater reduction in expression of CCP genes in men with prostate cancer on a high-ω-3 diet (r = -.57, P = .04).  Conclusions:   Host GPR120 plays a central role in the anti-prostate cancer effects of dietary ω-3 FAs.

Nanoparticles were prepared by solvent displacement method and characterized for particle size, TEM, entrapment efficiency, DSC and drug release study. RLPLGA exhibited a significant decrease in cell viability with 50% and 90% inhibitory concentration (IC50 and IC90) of 15.6 ± 1.49 and 41.1 ± 2.19 μM respectively against the LNCaP cells. This effect was mediated by apoptosis as confirmed by cell cycle arrest at G1-S transition phase, externalization of phosphatidylserine, DNA nicking, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species generation in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, significantly greater cytotoxicity to LNCaP cells was observed with nanoparticles as compared to that of free RL at all tested concentrations. RLPLGA nanoparticles presented no adverse cytotoxic effects on murine macrophages even at 200 μM.

Quantification of GPC-1 level is also pivotal to breast cancer and prostate cancer's patients. We hereby report the first biosensor for GPC-1 detection. Instead of using crosslinking technique and surface immobilization of antibody, we applied a novel method for biosensor fabrication, using S-Acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride (SAMSA) to modify the Anti-GPC-1 producing a thiol-linked Anti-GPC-1. The thiol-linked Anti-GPC-1 was then directly formed a single-layer antibody layer on the gold biosensor, minimizing the biosensor preparation steps significantly. Time of Flight Secondary Ions Mass Spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) characterization verified the thiol-linked antibody layer and demonstrated a unique perspective for surface protein characterization. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was applied to quantify GPC-1 antigen in undiluted human serum with a concentration range of 5,000 pg/µL to 100 pg/µL. The performance of this newly designed biosensor was also compared with modified self-assembled monolayer system fabricated biosensor, demonstrating the high-sensitivity and high-reproducibility of the SAMSA modified antibody based biosensor.

Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) has emerged as a technique that uses fluorescence to highlight cancerous cells and guide surgeons to resect tumors in real time. Thus, development of tumor-specific near-infrared (NIR) agents that target biomarkers solely expressed on prostate cancer cells will enable to assess negative tumor margins and affected lymph nodes.  Experimental design:   Because PSMA is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells in >90% of the prostate cancer patient population, a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted NIR agent (OTL78) was designed and synthesized. Optical properties, in vitro and in vivo specificity, tumor-to-background ratio (TBR), accomplishment of negative surgical tumor margins using FGS, pharmacokinetics (PKs) properties, and preclinical toxicology of OTL78 were then evaluated in requisite models.  Results:   OTL78 binds to PSMA-expressing cells with high affinity, concentrates selectively to PSMA-positive cancer tissues, and clears rapidly from healthy tissues with a half-time of 17 minutes. It also exhibits an excellent TBR (5:1) as well as safety profile in animals.

Methods and materials:   One hundred and eight patients with increased prostate-specific antigen levels, who received 68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT-guided RT for recurrent oligometastatic disease after primary therapy for PCa were included. The biochemical progression-free survival and distant disease-free survival after PSMA-ligand PET/CT-guided RT were determined. The patterns of progression were determined using renewed 68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT in patients with biochemical progression and compared with the clinical target volume of the 68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT-guided RT. The frequency of infield and outfield relapses was recorded.  Results:   A total of 97.2% (105 of 108) of patients showed a decrease in prostate-specific antigen levels after RT and were classified as biochemical responders. After the median follow-up of 18 months, 43.5% (47 of 108) of the patients experienced biochemical progression, resulting in an estimated biochemical progression-free survival of 16 months. Renewed 68Ga-PSMA-ligand PET/CT allowed localization of recurrent disease in 91.7% (33 of 36) of patients. Analysis of the patterns of progression resulted in a cumulative infield relapse rate of 12.1% (4 of 33) and a cumulative outfield relapse rate of 87.9% (29 of 33). The resultant median disease-free survival was 11 months. In terms of the pattern of progression, we observed a shift in the pattern of metastases toward skeletal involvement and distant lymph node metastases. Of these patients, 45.5% (15 of 33) were treated with further RT to delay initiation or escalation of systemic therapies.  Conclusion:   PSMA-ligand PET/CT-guided RT for relapsed PCa with limited tumor burden allowed individualization of treatment approaches, provided effective local control, and resulted in considerably prolonged biochemical progression-free survival. As indicated by the PSMA-ligand PET/CT-based patterns of progression, repeated PET/CT-guided RT may represent a treatment option in well-selected patients with relapse after RT for oligometastatic disease.""","""['Alexander Soldatov', 'Christoph A J von Klot', 'Daniel Walacides', 'Thorsten Derlin', 'Frank M Bengel', 'Tobias L Ross', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Katja Derlin', 'Markus A Kuczyk', 'Hans Christiansen', 'Christoph Henkenberens']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['(68)Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT-based radiotherapy in locally recurrent and recurrent oligometastatic prostate cancer : Early efficacy after primary therapy.', 'The feasibility of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography(PSMA PET/CT)-guided radiotherapy in oligometastatic prostate cancer patients.', 'Comparison of 68\u202fGa-PSMA ligand PET/CT versus conventional cross-sectional imaging for target volume delineation for metastasis-directed radiotherapy for metachronous lymph node metastases from prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Salvage Involved-Field and Extended-Field Radiation Therapy in Positron Emission Tomography-Positive Nodal Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Outcomes and Patterns of Failure.', 'The Prognostic Value of Liquid Biopsies for Benefit of Salvage Radiotherapy in Relapsed Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Stereotactic radiotherapy of nodal oligometastases from prostate cancer: a prisma-compliant systematic review.', 'The impact of PSMA PET on the treatment and outcomes of men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Emerging Role of Next-Generation Imaging in Prostate Cancer.']"""

TMPRSS2:ERG is the most frequent gene rearrangement identified in prostate cancer, but whether it is involved in prostate cancer bone metastases is largely unknown. We exploited an intratibial metastasis model to address this issue and we found that ectopic expression of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion enhances the ability of prostate cancer cell lines to induce osteoblastic lesions by stimulating bone formation and inhibiting the osteolytic response. In line with these in vivo results, we demonstrate that the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion protein increases the expression of osteoblastic markers, including Collagen Type I Alpha 1 Chain and Alkaline Phosphatase, as well as Endothelin-1, a protein with a documented role in osteoblastic bone lesion formation. Moreover, we determined that the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion protein is bound to the regulatory regions of these genes in prostate cancer cell lines, and we report that the expression levels of these osteoblastic markers are correlated with the expression of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion in patient metastasis samples.

Methods:   In this prospective single institution study, 129 patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels or abnormal digital rectal examination findings underwent MRI with an abbreviated biparamatric MRI protocol consisting of high-resolution axial T2- and diffusion-weighted images. Index lesions were classified according to modified Prostate Imaging - Reporting and Data System (mPI-RADS) version 2.0. All patients underwent standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy after MRI with the urologist being blinded to MRI results. Subsequently, all patients with suspicious lesions (mPI-RADS 3, 4, or 5) underwent cognitively guided targeted biopsy after discussion of MRI results with the urologist. Sensitivity and negative predictive value for identification of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason score 3+4 and above) were determined.  Results:   Rapid biparametric MRI discovered 176 lesions identified in 129 patients. Rapid MRI detected clinically significant cancers with a sensitivity of 95.1% with a negative predictive value of 95.1% and positive predictive value of 53.2%, leading to a change in management in 10.8% of the patients. False negative rate of biparametric (bp) MRI was 4.7%.

In 1994, a study demonstrated docetaxel-induced RRD for the first time; however, despite some case studies reporting RRD, a little has been reported on it since then. Here we present a rare case of atypical docetaxel-induced RRD.  Case presentation:   The patient in his 60s was administered radiotherapy for high-risk prostate cancer. He continued receiving hormonal therapy for 2 years because of being in a high-risk group and became nadir. Six months since the completion of hormonal therapy, his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level increased again. Based on the radiological examination, he was diagnosed with multiple lung, bone, and lymph node metastases. Accordingly, we started docetaxel (75 mg/m) every 5 weeks in consideration of myelosuppression for hormone-resistant multiple metastases. Although lung metastasis shrunk by one cycle docetaxel, radiotherapy for the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae was performed for back pain and lumbago. On day 21, at the end of radiotherapy, the same dose of docetaxel was administrated for the third time. On day 7, after third docetaxel administration, erythema appeared in a irradiated field of the thoracic and lumbar vertebra. Erythema primarily appeared on the anterior side of the body, and no skin reaction was noted on the posterior part of the thoracic irradiated area. Notably, no skin reaction was observed in the previously irradiated field for prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   This case report draws attention to the development of atypical RRD after administration of docetaxel and advises careful follow-up even if RRD does not appear after the first docetaxel administration.""","""['Masakuni Sakaguchi', 'Toshiya Maebayashi', 'Takuya Aizawa', 'Naoya Ishibashi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Radiation recall dermatitis after docetaxel chemotherapy.

We have previously shown that Snail can increase Cat L protein and activity in prostate and breast cancer. Western blot and real-time PCR analyses showed that mesenchymal protein expression (Snail, vimentin, Cat L) and Cat L activity (shown by zymography) was higher in AA prostate cancer cells as compared to CA normal transformed RWPE-1 prostate epithelial cells, and androgen-dependent cells, and comparable to metastatic CA cell lines. With respect to breast cancer, mesenchymal markers were higher in TNBC compared to non-TNBC cells. The higher mesenchymal marker expression was functionally associated with higher proliferative and migratory rates. Immunohistochemistry showed that both nuclear Snail and Cat L expression was significantly higher in cancer compared to normal for CA and Bahamas prostate patient tissue. Interestingly, AA normal tissue stained higher for nuclear Snail and Cat L that was not significantly different to cancer tissue for both prostate and breast tissue, but was significantly higher than CA normal tissue. AA TNBC tissue also displayed significantly higher nuclear Snail expression compared to CA TNBC, while no significant differences were observed with Luminal A cancer tissue.

However, the comparison of doxorubicin treatment between LNCaP cells carrying p53-wild type and PC3 cells carrying p53-null suggested that p53 might be essential for maximizing apoptosis. Inhibition of ATM did not affect doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of p53 did not affect ABT-263-induced apoptosis and nevertheless, the combination of doxorubicin with ABT-263 induced higher apoptotic responses than did doxorubicin or ABT-263 alone. These results advocated that doxorubicin-induced DNA damage controls p53 function for intensifying apoptosis. Indeed, overexpression of p53 only enhanced apoptosis under conditions of severe DNA damage induced by high concentrations of doxorubicin in LNCaP cells. Immunofluorescence staining showed vague γH2AX foci and enlarged nuclei in LNCaP cells in response to high concentrations of doxorubicin, en route to apoptosis. In addition, our results revealed that the apoptosis in response to DNA replication stress induced by CFS-1686, a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase, is p53-independent. Interestingly, the combination of doxorubicin with CFS-1686 generated DNA damage and replication stress simultaneously, resulting in a synergistic apoptotic effect in prostate cancer cells.

PC-3M cells were incubated with 0, 25, 50, 100 µg/ml of β-bourbonene. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) detection showed that compared with the control group, β-bourbonene inhibited the growth of PC-3M cells in a dose-dependent manner. G0/G1 phase arrest was observed by β-bourbonene by using flow cytometry. TUNEL staining and Annexin V/PI dual-staining method revealed that apoptosis was found in cells with β-bourbonene treatment, and the quantity of apoptotic cells was increased with the elevation in concentration. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Fas and FasL in the drug-treatment group were significantly elevated. Furthermore, the western blot assay also indicated that with an increase in the concentration of β-bourbonene, the protein expression of Bax in the drug-treatment group was significantly elevated, while a decrease was identified in the protein expression of Bcl-2. Taken together, β-bourbonene can inhibit the proliferation and simultaneously, induce apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest of prostate cancer PC-3M cells, which may be realized by upregulation of mRNA expression of Fas and FasL, increase of Bax protein expression and decrease of Bcl-2 protein expression.""","""['Zhong Wang', 'Feng Liu', 'Jian-Jun Yu', 'Ji-Zhong Jin']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['β-elemene induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in human glioma cells in vitro through the upregulation of Bax and Fas/ FasL and downregulation of Bcl-2.', 'DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF SIJUNZI DECOCTION INHIBIT PROLIFERATION AND INDUCE APOPTOSIS OF HUMAN GASTRIC CANCER SGC-7901 SIDE POPULATION.', 'Tehranolide inhibits proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells by inducing G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis.', 'The Anti-Proliferation, Cycle Arrest and Apoptotic Inducing Activity of Peperomin E on Prostate Cancer PC-3 Cell Line.', 'Effect of p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1 transfection on the biological characteristics of PC-3M human prostate cancer cells.', 'Dose-dependent effects of neem crude extract on human dental pulp cell and murine osteoblast viability and mineralization.', 'Molecular docking and dynamics simulation study of bioactive compounds from Ficus carica L. with important anticancer drug targets.']"""

Among RNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have an important role in gene expression regulation. Recent studies show aberrant lncRNAs expression in different types of cancer including blood malignancies. As such, lncRNAs could be a possible way for diagnosis and treatment of certain cancers. In the current study, the level of PCA3 gene expression in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was compared with normal individuals to find out whether the level of PCA3 in CML patients is increased according to our hypothesis.  Materials and methods:   The buffy coat was collected from peripheral blood of thirty untreated CML patients (BCR-ABL positive) and twenty normal volunteers. RNA was extracted from white blood cells and cDNA was synthesized. The level of PCA3 gene expression was measured using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   The results showed that PCA3 has expression in both normal and leukemic white blood cells. The data also revealed higher expression of PCA3 in leukemic patients, compared to the normal counterpart (P < 0.05).

Results:   In 2016, 132 patients were included. Fifty-seven patients (43%) used alternative and complementary medicine during radiotherapy, more women (61%) than men (35%) (P=0.005). The use of alternative and complementary medicine varied according to locations: 44% of head and neck cancers, 57% of breast cancers and 24% of prostate cancers, but sex was the confounding factor.

Tumors are usually located near the large blood vessels and the heat convection may affect the progression of the ice ball. Hence it is necessary to predict the surgery procedure and its consequences earlier. In spite of the recent studies it is still unclear that which arteries will significantly affect the freezing treatment of tumors and which can be ignored. Therefore a numerical model of a spherical 3 cm diameter liver tumor, subjected to cryosurgery was developed. The specific thermophysical properties were applied to the tumor and healthy tissues in frozen and unfrozen states. A simplified Hepatic artery with different anatomical diameters was placed in different positions relative to the tumor and energy and momentum equations were solved. The temperature distribution and the shape of the resultant ice ball were discussed. The results showed that a 4 mm diameter artery in the vicinity of a tumor will increase the minimum temperature achieved at the tumor boundary by 12.5 °C and therefore significantly affects the cryosurgery outcome. This may cause insufficient freezing which leads to incomplete death of tumor cells, failure of the surgery and tumor regenesis. Eventually it was shown that injection of gold and Fe3O4 nanoparticles to the surrounding tissue of the artery can enhance the heat transfer and progression of the ice ball, making temperature distribution similar to the no vessel state. Development of computational models can provide the physicians an applicable tool which helps them recognize how efficient a treatment method will be for a specific case and design a suitable cryosurgery plan.""","""['Malikeh Nabaei', 'Mehrdad Karimi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Therm Biol""","""['Nano-cryosurgery: advances and challenges.', 'Mathematical study of probe arrangement and nanoparticle injection effects on heat transfer during cryosurgery.', 'Nanoparticle-mediated cryosurgery for tumor therapy.', 'A finite element model for ice ball evolution in a multi-probe cryosurgery.', 'Numerical simulation of selective freezing of target biological tissues following injection of solutions with specific thermal properties.', 'In Silico Study on Tumor-Size-Dependent Thermal Profiles inside an Anthropomorphic Female Breast Phantom Subjected to Multi-Dipole Antenna Array.', 'GPU-based 3D iceball modeling for fast cryoablation simulation and planning.']"""

Materials and methods:   Patients with C-acetate avid positron emission tomography/computerized tomography imaged pelvic/retroperitoneal lymph nodes underwent high extended robotic lymphadenectomy. A standardized mapping template comprising 8 predetermined anatomical regions was dissected during lymphadenectomy, allowing for matched, region based analysis and comparison of imaging and histological data.  Results:   In 25 patients a total of 2,149 lymph nodes were excised (mean 86 per patient, range 27 to 136) and 528 (22%) harbored metastases (mean 21 positive nodes per patient, range 0 to 109). A total of 174 anatomical regions had matching imaging histological data.

An increasing, histologically measured metastatic lesion size in long axis diameter of 5 or less, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20 and 21 mm or greater correlated with improved C-acetate detection rates of 45%, 62%, 81%, 89% and 100%, respectively.

Total PSA (tPSA) and free PSA (fPSA) stabilities were also assessed. Methods Blood was drawn from 26 patients and separated in two tubes for plasma (K2EDTA and K2EDTA plus protease inhibitors - P100) and one for serum (clot activator plus gel separator). Tubes were stored at room temperature before centrifugation 1, 3 and 5 h for serum and EDTA plasma or 1 and 5 h for P100 plasma. To investigate the influence of gel separator on markers' stability, blood was collected from 10 patients in three types of tubes to obtain serum: tubes with clot activator plus gel separator, with silica particles or glass tubes. Biomarkers were assayed with chemiluminescent immunoassays. Results [-2]proPSA and Phi levels significantly and progressively increased over time in serum (+4.81% and +8.2% at 3 h; +12.03% and +14.91% at 5 h, respectively, vs. 1 h; p<0.001). Conversely, [-2]proPSA levels did not change in plasma (EDTA or P100). tPSA levels did not change over time in serum or plasma, whereas fPSA decreased in serum. All markers were higher in plasma than in serum at any time point. This difference did not seem to be attributable to the use of gel for serum preparation. Conclusions EDTA prevented spurious in vitro modifications in PSA-related isoforms, confirming that a stabilized blood sample is a prerequisite for [-2]proPSA measurement and Phi determination.""","""['Ruggero Dittadi', 'Aline S C Fabricio', 'Giulia Rainato', 'Edoardo Peroni', 'Fulvio Di Tonno', 'Beatrice Vezzù', 'Chiara Mazzariol', 'Elisa Squarcina', 'Laura Tammone', 'Massimo Gion']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Chem Lab Med""","""['From prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to precursor PSA (proPSA) isoforms: a review of the emerging role of proPSAs in the detection and management of early prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of (-2)proPSA in combination with total PSA and free PSA for the early detection of prostate cancer.', 'ProPSA and the Prostate Health Index as predictive markers for aggressiveness in low-risk prostate cancer-results from an international multicenter study.', 'ProPSA and diagnostic biopsy tissue DNA content combination improves accuracy to predict need for prostate cancer treatment among men enrolled in an active surveillance program.', 'Evaluation of -2 proPSA and Prostate Health Index (phi) for the detection of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Analytical performance of thrombospondin-1 and cathepsin D immunoassays part of a novel CE-IVD marked test as an aid in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Beyond PSA: The Role of Prostate Health Index (phi).']"""

Procedures:   Eight patients with metastatic non-clear cell RCC underwent imaging with PSMA-targeted [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT. Imaged RCC histologic subtypes included papillary RCC (n = 3), chromophobe RCC (n = 2), unclassified RCC (n = 2), and Xp11 translocation RCC (n = 1). Using comparison to conventional CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging as reference, two radiologists with expertise in nuclear medicine identified putative sites of disease on [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT and classified each lesion as having no radiotracer uptake, equivocal uptake, or definitive uptake.  Resuts:   In total, 73 metastatic sites and 3 primary tumors compatible with sites of non-clear cell RCC were identified on conventional imaging. Metastatic sites of disease included lymph nodes (n = 40), venous thrombi (n = 3), pulmonary nodules (n = 10), bone lesions (n = 15), brain lesions (n = 3), and retroperitoneal masses (n = 2). Only 10 of the 73 lesions (13.7 %) were classified as having definitive radiotracer uptake (median SUVmax = 3.25, range = 1.2-9.5), 14 lesions (19.2 %) had equivocal uptake (median SUVmax = 2.85, range = 0.5-6.5), and 49 lesions (67.1 %) had no definitive uptake above background (median SUVmax = 1.7, range = 0.2-3.0). The three primary renal tumors demonstrated lower radiotracer avidity relative to surrounding normal renal parenchyma.  Conclusions:   A small proportion of sites of non-clear cell RCC showed uptake of the PSMA-targeted radiotracer [18F]DCFPyL.

The contribution of acquired genomic variation to this racial disparity is largely unknown, as genomic from Africa is lacking. Here, we performed the first tumor-normal paired deep whole-genome sequencing for Africa. A direct study-matched comparison between African- and European-derived, treatment-naïve, high-risk prostate tumors for 15 cases allowed for further comparative analyses of existing data. Excluding a single hypermutated tumor with 55 mutations per megabase, we observed a 1.8-fold increase in small somatic variants in African- versus European-derived tumors (P = 1.02e-04), rising to 4-fold when compared with published tumor-matched data. Furthermore, we observed an increase in oncogenic driver mutations in African tumors (P = 2.92e-03); roughly 30% of impacted genes were novel to prostate cancer, and 79% of recurrent driver mutations appeared early in tumorigenesis. Although complex genomic rearrangements were less frequent in African tumors, we describe a uniquely hyperduplicated tumor affecting 149 transposable elements. Comparable with African Americans, ERG fusions and PIK3CA mutations were absent and PTEN loss less frequent. CCND1 and MYC were frequently gained, with somatic copy-number changes more likely to occur late in tumorigenesis. In addition to traditional prostate cancer gene pathways, genes regulating calcium ion-ATPase signal transduction were disrupted in African tumors. Although preliminary, our results suggest that further validation and investigation into the potential implications for elevated tumor mutational burden and tumor-initiating mutations in clinically unfavorable prostate cancer can improve patient outcomes in Africa. SIGNIFICANCE: The first whole-genome sequencing study for high-risk prostate cancer in African men allows a simultaneous comparison of ethnic differences relative to European populations and of the influences of the environment relative to African-American men.

However, its clinical features and prognosis have not been fully evaluated.  Objective:   To investigate the clinical features of low-PSA mPCa and the impact of low PSA level on overall survival (OS) and PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) of mPCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 8479 mPCa patients were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (2010-2015). The median follow-up was 18 mo.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cox regression and Fine-Gray competing risk were used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) for OS and PCSM, respectively.  Results and limitations:   A higher rate of T4 stage disease (19.8%) and visceral metastasis (18.2%) and the shortest median OS (34 mo) were observed in mPCa patients with Gleason 8-10 and PSA ≤4ng/ml. In the Cox regression model, PSA ≤4ng/ml was a significant predictor of OS for Gleason 8-10 disease. The distribution of PCSM by PSA was U-shaped for Gleason score 8-10 (PSA 4.1-10ng/ml as the referent), with an adjusted sHR of 1.52 for PSA ≤4.0ng/ml (95% confidence interval: 1.17-1.96) versus 0.99 for PSA 10.1-20ng/ml and 1.35 for PSA >20ng/ml. In contrast, the distribution of PCSM by PSA was linear for Gleason 5-7. Sensitivity analyses showed similar results in Gleason 9-10 and Gleason 10 subgroup. The study is limited by its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   Low PSA, high-grade mPCa has a higher proportion of T4 stage disease, visceral metastasis, and PCSM.  Patient summary:   We found that 2.8% of high-grade metastatic prostate cancer has a prostate-specific antigen level ≤4ng/ml at diagnosis. This population has aggressive clinical features and a poor cancer-specific outcome.

Methods and materials:   Forty-five patients undergoing permanent Pd-103 seed implantation for prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled. Seed implantation was performed and dose was tracked intraoperatively using intraoperative registered ultrasound and fluoroscopy (iRUF). Three-dimensional seed locations were computed from X-rays and registered to ultrasound for intraoperative dosimetry, followed by adaptive plan modification to achieve prostate V100 ≥95% and ≥95% D90. Time required for iRUF was recorded. Postoperative CT/MRI scans were performed 1 day after the implantation and used as reference for dosimetric analysis. Dosimetric parameters for the prostate and urethra were compared between standard ultrasound-based dosimetry (USD), iRUF, and postoperative CT/MRI.  Results:   Mean total time for iRUF was <30 min. A mean of four seeds (0-12) were added per implant to correct cold spots discovered by iRUF. Day 1 CT/MRI prostate V100 was ≥95% for 44/45 patients; 1 patient had Day 1 V100 93%. No patient had rectal V100 exceeding 1 cc. Compared to CT/MRI, iRUF dosimetry had significantly smaller mean differences and higher correlations for all prostate and urethral dosimetric parameters examined than USD. Both USD and iRUF tended to overestimate dose, but with less bias in iRUF than USD.  Conclusions:   Intraoperative dosimetry utilizing iRUF was associated with acceptable increase in procedure time and enabled very high rates of achieving excellent prostate dose coverage. iRUF intraoperative dosimetry approximated postoperative CT/MRI dosimetry to a greater degree than USD for the prostate and urethra.""","""['Junghoon Lee', 'Robert F Hobbs', 'Marianna Zahurak', 'Sook Kien Ng', 'Zhe Zhang', 'E Clif Burdette', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Daniel Y Song']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Superior Postimplant Dosimetry Achieved Using Dynamic Intraoperative Dosimetry for Permanent Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'Intraoperative Registered Ultrasound and Fluoroscopy (iRUF) for dose calculation during prostate brachytherapy: Improved accuracy compared to standard ultrasound-based dosimetry.', 'Prostate brachytherapy intraoperative dosimetry using a combination of radiographic seed localization with a C-arm and deformed ultrasound prostate contours.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

Expression of prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF), a transcription factor, is highly restricted to epithelial cells in hormone-regulated tissues. MYC and its negative regulator MAD1 play an important role in BC progression. Previously, we found that PDEF expression is strongly correlated with AR expression. However, the relationship between AR and PDEF and the function of PDEF in ER-negative BC proliferation are unclear.  Methods:   AR and PDEF expression in ER-negative BC tissues and cell lines was determined by performing immunohistochemistry or western blotting. Protein expression levels and location were analysed by performing western blotting, RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining. Co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to validate the regulation of AR-PDEF-MAD1-MYC axis. Moreover, the effect of AR and PDEF on BC progression was investigated both in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   We found that PDEF was overexpressed in ER-negative BC tissues and cell lines and appeared to function as an oncogene. PDEF expression levels were strongly correlated with AR expression in ER-negative BC, and PDEF transcription was positively regulated by AR. PDEF upregulated MYC-mediated gene transcription by promoting MAD1 degradation in ER-negative BC. Finally, we found that compared with the inhibition of AR expression alone, simultaneous inhibition of AR and PDEF expression further suppressed tumour proliferation both in vitro and in vivo.

Although the tumorigenic potential of Orai3 is associated with increase in its expression, the molecular machinery regulating its expression remains largely unexplored. Here, by performing extensive bioinformatics analysis and functional studies, we identify and characterize micro-RNAs (miRNAs) that regulate Orai3 expression and function. We demonstrate that miR18a and miR18b positively regulate Orai3 whereas miR34a represses Orai3 expression and function. All these miRs exert their effect on Orai3 by virtue of their direct action on Orai3 3'UTR. These miRs provide novel opportunities for targeting Orai3 for better management of cancer.

At 90% sensitivity for PCa, the specificity of the model was 62%, while %fPSA had a specificity of 23%. For high grade (Gleason score ≥ 7 in prostatectomy specimen) PCa, the specificity was 48% at 90% sensitivity, with an AUC of 0.83, (P < 0.001, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.88). Limitations of the study include the retrospective set-up and single-centre cohort.  Conclusions:   A model combining two cancer-related glycoproteins (THBS1 and CTSD) and %fPSA can improve PCa diagnosis and may reduce the number of unnecessary prostate biopsies because of its improved specificity for PCa when compared to %fPSA alone.""","""['Thomas Steuber', 'Pierre Tennstedt', 'Annalisa Macagno', 'Alcibiade Athanasiou', 'Anja Wittig', 'Ramy Huber', 'Bruno Golding', 'Ralph Schiess', 'Silke Gillessen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Development and clinical testing of individual immunoassays for the quantification of serum glycoproteins to diagnose prostate cancer.', 'A Four-kallikrein Panel Predicts High-grade Cancer on Biopsy: Independent Validation in a Community Cohort.', 'Clinical usefulness of free PSA in early detection of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Current early diagnostic biomarkers of prostate cancer.', 'Relationship between Proclarix and the Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel Blood Proteomic Signature for Prostate Cancer.', 'Biomarkers for prostate cancer detection and risk stratification.', 'Comparison of Proclarix, PSA Density and MRI-ERSPC Risk Calculator to Select Patients for Prostate Biopsy after mpMRI.', 'Use of MS-GUIDE for identification of protein biomarkers for risk stratification of patients with prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   A retrospective 20-year cohort study in men residing in Saskatchewan, aged 40-89 years, with a BPH-coded medical claim between 1995 and 2014, was conducted. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compare incidence of PCa diagnosis, metastatic PCa, Gleason score 8-10 PCa, and PCa mortality among 5ARI users (n = 4 571), α-blocker users (n = 7 764) and non-users (n = 11 677).  Results:   In comparison with both non-users and α-blocker users, 5ARI users had a ~40% lower risk of a PCa diagnosis (11.0% and 11.4% vs 5.8%, respectively), and α-blocker users had an 11% lower risk of a PCa diagnosis compared with non-users. Overall, the incidence of metastatic PCa and PCa mortality was not significantly different among 5ARI or α-blocker users compared with non-users (adjusted hazard ratios [HR] of metastatic PCa: 1.12 and 1.13, respectively, and PCa mortality: 1.11 and 1.18, respectively, P > 0.05 for both drugs), but both 5ARI and a-blocker users had ~30% higher risk of Gleason score 8-10 cancer, adjusted HR 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.82, P = 0.03, and adjusted HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59, P = 0.02, respectively compared with non-users.  Conclusion:   The use of 5ARIs was associated with lower risk of PCa diagnosis, regardless of comparison group.

One of the limiting factors of this therapy is prostatic calcifications. These attenuate and reflect ultrasound and thus reduce the efficacy of the heating. The aim of this study is to investigate how prostatic calcifications affect therapeutic efficacy, and to identify the best sonication strategy when calcifications are present.  Methods:   Realistic computational models were used on clinical patient data in order to simulate different therapeutic situations with naturally occurring calcifications as well as artificial calcifications of different sizes (1-10 mm) and distances (5-15 mm). Furthermore, different sonication strategies were tested in order to deliver therapy to the untreated tissue regions behind the calcifications.  Results:   The presence of calcifications in front of the ultrasound field was found to increase the peak pressure by 100% on average while the maximum temperature only rose by 9% during a 20-s sonication. Losses in ultrasound energy were due to the relatively large acoustic impedance mismatch between the prostate tissue and the calcifications (1.63 vs 3.20 MRayl) and high attenuation coefficient (0.78 vs 2.64 dB/MHz1.1 /cm), which together left untreated tissue regions behind the calcifications. In addition, elevated temperatures were seen in the region between the transducer and the calcifications. Lower sonication frequencies (1-4 MHz) were not able to penetrate through the calcifications effectively, but longer sonication durations (20-60 s) with selective transducer elements were effective in treating the tissue regions behind the calcifications.  Conclusions:   Prostatic calcifications limit the reach of therapeutic ultrasound treatment due to reflections and attenuation. The tissue regions behind the calcifications can possibly be treated using longer sonication durations combined with proper transducer element selection. However, caution should be taken with calcifications located close to sensitive organs such as the urethra, bladder neck, or rectal wall.""","""['Visa Suomi', 'Bradley Treeby', 'Jiri Jaros', 'Pietari Makela', 'Mikael Anttinen', 'Jani Saunavaara', 'Teija Sainio', 'Aida Kiviniemi', 'Roberto Blanco']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Curvilinear transurethral ultrasound applicator for selective prostate thermal therapy.', '3D conformal MRI-controlled transurethral ultrasound prostate therapy: validation of numerical simulations and demonstration in tissue-mimicking gel phantoms.', 'Simulation study on the heating of the surrounding anatomy during transurethral ultrasound prostate therapy: a 3D theoretical analysis of patient safety.', 'Transurethral ultrasound applicators with directional heating patterns for prostate thermal therapy: in vivo evaluation using magnetic resonance thermometry.', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia.

We additionally examined cell survival in the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and LNCaP under severe hypoxic (0.1% O2) and normoxic (20% O2) conditions. qRT-PCR showed higher up-regulation of PKM2 mRNA expression in LNCaP cells than in PC3 cells, while western blotting showed that PKM2 protein levels were up-regulated only in LNCaP cells. Inhibition of HIF-1α and HIF-2α by small interfering RNA (si-RNA) demonstrated HIF-1α dependent up-regulation of PKM2 at the mRNA and protein levels in LNCaP cells. PKM2 inhibition by si-RNA significantly decreased hypoxia-response element (HRE) activation in a gene reporter assay and down-regulated HIF-1α target vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression in PC3 cells, whereas HIF-1α protein levels were not significantly reduced. Additionally, PKM2 inhibition significantly reduced clonogenic survival in both cell lines in a colony formation assay. Prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) mRNA expression was up-regulated in both cell lines. It has been shown that PKM2 expression is regulated by HIF-1α and that PKM2 favors HIF-1α transactivation under mild (1% O2) but not severe (0.1% O2) hypoxic conditions, and some of our findings are consistent with these previous results. However, this mechanism was not fully observed in our studied cell lines, as PKM2 regulation and HIF-1α stabilization at the transactivation level occurred under severe hypoxic conditions. This discrepancy suggests that tumor tissue origin and cell type influence this model. Our findings expand the current knowledge of the mechanisms of PCA regulation, and would be important in developing novel therapeutic strategies.""","""['Diya Hasan', 'Elisabetta Gamen', 'Nafez Abu Tarboush', 'Yazan Ismail', 'Oleg Pak', 'Belal Azab']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['PHD3 is a transcriptional coactivator of HIF-1α in nucleus pulposus cells independent of the PKM2-JMJD5 axis.', 'PKM2 promotes tumor angiogenesis by regulating HIF-1α through NF-κB activation.', 'Hypoxia-induced lncRNA-AC020978 promotes proliferation and glycolytic metabolism of non-small cell lung cancer by regulating PKM2/HIF-1α axis.', 'The Role of PKM2 in Metabolic Reprogramming: Insights into the Regulatory Roles of Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in cancer and cancer therapeutics.', 'Targeting PKLR/MYCN/ROMO1 signaling suppresses neuroendocrine differentiation of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Expression of HIF-1α/PKM2 axis correlates to biological and clinical significance in papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'Hypoxia promotes conversion to a stem cell phenotype in prostate cancer cells by activating HIF-1α/Notch1 signaling pathway.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Placental proteome in late‑onset of fetal growth restriction.']"""

The study of PCa metabolism thus represents a new avenue for diagnostics, particularly early diagnosis of aggressive PCa cases.  Results:   Here, by clustering tissue transcriptomics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (498 PCa patients), we identified six metabolic subgroups (C1-C6) of PCa that show distinct disease-free survival (DFS) outcomes (p < 0.0001). In particular, we identified at least two subgroups (C5 & C3) that exhibit significant poor prognosis (∼70% and 30-40% relapse within the first 72 months; hazards ratios of 9.4 and 4.4, respectively, relative to the best prognosis cluster C4 that showed <20% relapse even by 120 months). We were able to reproduce the subgroups in several independent datasets including B. S. Taylor et al. (2010) data; 215 patients; DFS p = 0.00088) using a multinomial regression classifier. The subgroups displayed distinct metabolic profiles vis-à-vis normal tissues, measured as 'deregulation' observed for 20 metabolic pathways (using Pathifier; Y. Drier and E. Domany, 2013). In particular, C5 and C3 showed considerable deregulation for pathways involved in synthesis and catabolism of complex forms of lipids and carbohydrates, and these were exhibited in parallel or in the face of glycolysis, a common form of energy production in cancer cells. The subgroups were significantly over-enriched for different sets of genetic alterations [BRCA1, MSH2, FOXA1, TP53 (C5), RB1 and STK11(C3); and AR (C1); p ≤ 8.6 × 10-4], suggesting that distinct sets of alterations underpinning the PCa subgroups that 'push' the subgroups towards their unique metabolic profiles. Finally, applying the classifier to blood protein expression profiles from 42 active surveillance (AS) and 65 advanced castrate resistant PCa (ACRPC) patients (D. Olmos et al., 2012) assigned 70.77% ACPRC and interestingly reassigned 59.52% AS patients to at least one of the poor prognosis subgroups with 35.71% to the metabolically active poor-prognosis subgroup C3.  Conclusion:   The identification of PCa subgroups displaying distinct clinical outcomes solely from metabolic expression profiles of PCa tumours reiterates the significant link between deregulated metabolism and PCa outcomes (E. Eidelman et al., 2017). On the other hand, the time to biochemical relapse (rise in PSA levels) was not indicative of early relapse seen for subgroups C3 and C5 (these show considerably late BCR compared to C4). Our study thus highlights specific processes (elevated lipid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways) that could be better indicators than PSA for early diagnosis of aggressive PCa.

Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for overall PCa risk and stratified by Gleason grade and tumor stage. We compared normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic men on four cholesterol parameters total cholesterol (TC), HDL, LDL, and triglycerides (TG), analyzed as time-dependent variables.  Results:   TC in the highest tertile (above 5.1 mmol/l) and LDL above 3 mmol/l were associated with increased risk of Gleason 8-10 cancer (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.04-1.95 and HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.02-1.86, respectively). Further, overall PCa risk was elevated in the 3-year lag time analysis by TC in the highest two tertiles (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05-1.54 for TC above 4.4 mmol/l, and HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.05-1.51 for TC above 5.1 mmol/l) and HDL in the highest tertile (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.08-1.64) and above 1 mmol/l (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01-1.65). In contrast, TC in the highest tertile was associated with a decreased risk of PCa with 20-year lag time. The risk associations for overall PCa grew stronger with added lag time but were observed only in the FinRSPC control arm. Statin use did not modify the risk association.  Conclusions:   Hypercholesterolemia may increase overall PCa risk in short-term, inverse risk association was observed with 20-years' time lag. Similar risk increase of overall PCa was also observed for elevated HDL, conflicting with previous findings on the subject.""","""['Teemu J Murtola', 'Tatu V J Kasurinen', 'Kirsi Talala', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Blood cholesterol, tumor clinical characteristics and risk of prostate cancer progression after radical prostatectomy.', 'Antidiabetic drug use and prostate cancer risk in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Allopurinol and the risk of prostate cancer in a Finnish population-based cohort.', 'Cholesterol Levels in Blood and the Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis of 14 Prospective Studies.', 'Cholesterol and breast cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.', 'Pseurotin A Validation as a Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Recurrence-Suppressing Lead via PCSK9-LDLR Axis Modulation.', 'A high high-density lipoprotein level is associated with Gleason score upgrade in Chinese patients diagnosed with high-grade prostate carcinoma.', 'Preoperative Naples prognostic score is a reliable prognostic indicator for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients.', 'Conventional androgen deprivation therapy is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in advanced prostate cancer, a nationwide population-based study.', 'Human Prostate Tissue MicroRNAs and Their Predicted Target Pathways Linked to Prostate Cancer Risk Factors.']"""

Methods:   The database Policy Reporter was used to evaluate private payer coverage related to prostate MRI for 81 plans covering 149 million people in the United States. Both the indications and requirements for prostate MRI coverage were recorded in a variety of clinical scenarios, including initial diagnosis, staging, active surveillance, and suspected recurrence.  Results:   Overall, 11.1% of payers cover prostate MRI in biopsy-naïve patients with suspected prostate cancer, with the remaining 88.9% requiring a prior negative biopsy. Nearly all payers also require either a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE). Rarely, a planned future MRI-targeted biopsy serves as a basis for MRI coverage. Initial staging is covered by most payers, although typically with stringent indications (eg, PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL, Gleason score ≥7 or 8, stage T3 or T4, or ≥20% risk of nodal metastases). Only 10 payers discuss active surveillance, with 8 of these requiring a repeat biopsy before MRI. Coverage for detection of post-treatment recurrence often requires a rising PSA or abnormal DRE, and occasionally only if a CT is first performed; only 10 of 81 payers address coverage after androgen deprivation treatment.  Conclusion:   Prostate MRI coverage varies widely among private payers, fails to recognize major clinical scenarios, is overly restrictive, and is often not reflective of current clinical practice. This creates challenges for patients and referring physicians seeking to obtain ready access to prostate MRI services.""","""['Michael T Booker', 'Ezequiel Silva rd', 'Andrew B Rosenkrantz']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Am Coll Radiol""","""['The Economic Logic for Clinical Decision Support Is Changing.', 'Risk-stratification based on magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific antigen density may reduce unnecessary follow-up biopsy procedures in men on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of Cancer Detection Rates Between TRUS-Guided Biopsy and MRI-Targeted Biopsy According to PSA Level in Biopsy-Naive Patients: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.', 'The Value of Endorectal Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate in Improving the Detection of Anterior Prostate Cancer.', 'The Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) in the Detection, Evaluation, and Surveillance of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer (csPCa).', 'A comparison of magnetic resonance imaging techniques used to secure biopsies in prostate cancer patients.', 'Relationships between holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and prostate cancer.', ""Race-insurance disparities in prostate patients' magnetic resonance imaging biopsies and their subsequent cancer care: a New York State cohort study."", 'Disparities in magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate for traditionally underserved patients with prostate cancer.', 'Imaging for prostate cancer: reimbursements.']"""

Recto-urinary Fistula (RUF) is a rare complication following prostate cancer treatment, and can have a major impact on patients' quality of life. There is a lack of consensus concerning the best approach and different techniques have been proposed: endoscopic, transrectal, perineal and transperitoneal (open, laparoscopic or robotic).  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who underwent RUF repair from January 2001 to December 2010 at our Institute. 16 patients who developed RUF following prostate cancer treatment were included in the study. The fistula had to be confirmed both clinically and by imaging. All patients had follow up consultation every 3 month for the first year and then annually. They were asked to fill questionnaires evaluating functional outcomes. The International Continence Society (ICS) score was used to assess the postoperative urinary continence. Fecal continence was evaluated with the Wexner score and sexual function was assessed with the International Index for erectile function (IIEF-5) score.  Results:   Eighty-seven percent patients (14/16) in our series developed RUF as a consequence of prostate cancer surgery and 13% (2/16) postbrachytherapy (BT). All patients initially had a diversion colostomy and a supra pubic catheter. 69% (11/16) underwent primary YM repair and 73% (8/11) were successful. 2/3 primary failures were successfully retreated with graciloplasty. Primary gracilis flap interposition (GFI), on 3 non-irradiated patients were successful (100%). Primary GFI postbrachytherapy, no patient had recover urinary and digestive continuity. In total primary GIF was successful in 60% (3/5). Over all long term, success rate with a urinary and digestive continuity and without recurrence of the fistula was 81% (13/16). Mid term functional results were evaluated at mean follow up of 40 months (14-92). 13% (2/16) achieved complete urinary continence, 48% (7/16) required single pad, 25% (4/16) developed major incontinence, 7% (1/16) required urinary diversion and 13% (2/16) developed complete urethral closure post BT requiring permanent suprapubic catheterization. Colostomy was reversed in 93% (15/16) cases. 75% (12/16) achieved complete faecal continence, minor incontinence (wexner score 3-4) was seen in 13% (2/16) and major incontinence (wexner score 14) in 7% (1/16) and 7% (1/16) required a long term colostomy. 19% (3/16) developed colostomy related complications. Only 13% (2/16) achieved adequate erections with the use of intra cavernosal prostaglandin injections.  Conclusions:   RUF following prostate cancer treatment is a serious complication with severe repercussion on patients' quality of life. Surgical repair with the York Mason technique or Gracilis Flap interposition is associated with good success rates. If available pediculed gracilis muscle should be used as it offers better success rates.

We aimed to investigate the effects of apalutamide versus placebo added to androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQOL).  Methods:   SPARTAN is a multicentre, international, randomised, phase 3 trial. Participants were aged 18 years or older, with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen doubling time of 10 months or less, and a prostate-specific antigen concentration of 2 ng/mL or more in serum. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to 240 mg oral apalutamide per day plus androgen deprivation therapy, or matched oral placebo plus androgen deprivation therapy, using an interactive voice randomisation system. Permuted block randomisation was used according to the three baseline stratification factors: prostate-specific antigen doubling time (>6 months vs ≤6 months), use of bone-sparing drugs (yes vs no), and presence of local-regional nodal disease (N0 vs N1). Each treatment cycle was 28 days. The primary endpoint was metastasis-free survival. The trial was unblinded in July, 2017. In this prespecified exploratory analysis we assessed HRQOL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and EQ-5D-3L questionnaires, which we collected at baseline, day 1 of cycle 1 (before dose), day 1 of treatment cycles 1-6, day 1 of every two cycles from cycles 7 to 13, and day 1 of every four cycles thereafter. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01946204.  Findings:   Between Oct 14, 2013, and Dec 15, 2016, we randomly assigned 1207 patients to receive apalutamide (n=806) or placebo (n=401). The clinical cutoff date, as for the primary analysis, was May 19, 2017. Median follow-up for overall survival was 20·3 months (IQR 14·8-26·6). FACT-P total and subscale scores were associated with a preservation of HRQOL from baseline to cycle 29 in the apalutamide group; there were similar results for EQ-5D-3L. At baseline, the mean for FACT-P total score in both the apalutamide and placebo groups were consistent with the FACT-P general population norm for US adult men. Group mean patient-reported outcome scores over time show that HRQOL was maintained from baseline after initiation of apalutamide treatment and was similar over time among patients receiving apalutamide versus placebo. Least-squares mean change from baseline shows that HRQOL deterioration was more apparent in the placebo group.  Interpretation:   In asymptomatic men with high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, HRQOL was maintained after initiation of apalutamide treatment. Considered with findings from SPARTAN, patients who received apalutamide had longer metastasis-free survival and longer time to symptomatic progression than did those who received placebo, while preserving HRQOL.

The main aim of a targeted drug-delivery technique is to release the drug cargo selectively into tumor tissues, avoiding off-site toxicity to healthy tissues and organs during chemotherapy. In this strategy, a chemotherapeutic drug is conjugated to a homing ligand, which has high affinity for proteins over-expressed on cancer cells, via a peptide linker and a self-immolative segment that facilitates intracellular release of drug cargo. During development of targeted drug conjugates, preclinical evaluation in tumor models of small animals like mice adds valuable data on the clinical performance of the drug.

We included eight cancers (hepatocellular carcinoma, and thyroid, colorectal, gastric, lung, prostate, breast, and cervical cancer), using Korea Central Cancer Registry data. Severity level was classified by Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) stage as follows: localized, regional, distant, or unknown. Numbers of incident cancer cases from 2006 to 2013 were described by sex and SEER stage. We estimated up to 8-year observed survival rates of major cancers by sex and SEER stage, and provided prevalence rates by sex and SEER stage in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Although increases in new cancer cases are slowing and the total number of incident cancer cases in 2013 decreased for the first time since 2006, the number of prevalent cancer cases was 663,530 in 2013, an increase of 13.3% compared to 2011. Among the five cancers affecting both sexes, sex-related differences in 5-year observed survival rates for lung cancer were greatest in the localized stage (men, 31.9%; women, 48.1%), regional stage (men, 20.0%; women, 31.3%), and unknown stage (men, 24.3%; women, 37.5%). The sum of the proportions of localized and regional stages for thyroid and breast cancer was over 90% in 2013, while the sum of the proportions of localized and regional stages for lung cancer was only 56.7% in 2013. Differences in observed survival rates between men and women were prominent in lung cancer for all SEER stages.

Deterioration of sexual function scores was observed at 6 months within each segment (P = 0.001-0.16). There were no statistically significant differences in QoL scores between prostate segments (P = 0.08-0.97). Older patients or those with poor baseline sexual function at time of treatment were associated with a greater risk of developing erectile dysfunction.

Data on the TRPV6 status of ovarian malignancies has not received significant attention. The effect of inhibiting TRPV6 activity on ovarian tumour growth has never been reported. Methods: We quantified TRPV6 mRNA and protein in biopsies of five types of ovarian cancer at different stages and grades by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry respectively. We verified the presence of TRPV6 in SKOV-3 cells and xenografts by Western Blotting. NOD/SCID mice bearing xenografted ovarian tumours derived from SKOV-3 were treated daily with TRPV6-antagonistic peptides (SOR-C13 and SOR-C27) at 400, 600 and 800 mg/kg delivered intraperitoneally (i.p.) over 12 days. Data from qPCR and tumour growth experiments were compared with a Student's t-test. Immunohistochemical ranking of staining were compared with Kruskall-Wallace one-way ANOVA and Dunn's Multiple Comparison post-test. Results: TRPV6 mRNA and protein are significantly elevated at all stages and grades of 5 ovarian cancer types over normal tissue. Overall qPCR log2 values (n, mean, ± SEM) for mRNA in tumour (n = 165, 5.06 ± 0.16) were greater (p < 0.05) than normal tissues (n = 26, 0.45 ± 0.41). All stages and grades included in the biopsy arrays were significantly greater than normal tissues. Immunohistochemical staining of TRPV6 was ranked >2 (faint in most cells) in 80.5% of tumours (123) while 92% of normal tissues (23) ranked ≤ 2. Daily i.p. injection with SOR-C13 (400, 600 and 800 mg/kg) over 12 days inhibits tumour growth (59%) at the highest dose compared to non-treated controls. SOR-C27 at 800 mg/kg SOR-C27 inhibited tumour growth 55% after 12 days. Results of daily and intermittent dosing (Days 1, 2, 3 and 8, 9, 10) with SOR-C13 were indistinguishable. Conclusion: TRPV6 mRNA and protein are elevated in biopsies of ovarian cancers compared to normal tissue. Inhibition of TRPV6 activity significantly reduces ovarian tumour growth providing evidence that TRPV6 is a feasible oncology target in ovarian cancers.""","""['Hui Xue', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Tyson J MacCormack', 'Tyler Lutes', 'Christopher Rice', 'Michelle Davey', 'Dominique Dugourd', 'T Toney Ilenchuk', 'John M Stewart']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Cancer""","""['In vivo detection of human TRPV6-rich tumors with anti-cancer peptides derived from soricidin.', 'The low PLC-δ1 expression in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells induces upregulation of TRPV6 channel activity.', 'First-in-human phase I study of SOR-C13, a TRPV6 calcium channel inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors.', 'Determining the Crystal Structure of TRPV6.', 'TRPV6 as A Target for Cancer Therapy.', 'Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics of Epithelial Ovarian Cancers: A Clinical Perspective.', 'Intracellular Helix-Loop-Helix Domain Modulates Inactivation Kinetics of Mammalian TRPV5 and TRPV6 Channels.', 'The regulatory and modulatory roles of TRP family channels in malignant tumors and relevant therapeutic strategies.', 'Ca2+ Signalling and Hypoxia/Acidic Tumour Microenvironment Interplay in Tumour Progression.', 'TRPV6 Regulation by Cis-22a and Cholesterol.']"""

This study examines several radiobiological models for the calculation of tumor control probability (TCP) of intensity modulated radiotherapy plans for the treatment of lung, prostate, and head and neck (H&N) cancers.  Methods::   Dose volume histogram (DVH) data from the intensity modulated radiotherapy plans of 36 lung, 26 prostate, and 87 H&N cases were evaluated. The Poisson, Niemierko, and Marsden models were used to calculate the TCP of each disease group treatment plan. The calculated results were analyzed for correlation and discrepancy among the three models, as well as different treatment sites under study.  Results::   The median value of calculated TCP in lung plans was 61.9% (34.1-76.5%), 59.5% (33.5-73.9%) and 32.5% (0.0-93.9%) with the Poisson, Niemierko, and Marsden models, respectively. The median value of calculated TCP in prostate plans was 85.1% (56.4-90.9%), 81.2% (56.1-88.7%) and 62.5% (28.2-75.9%) with the Poisson, Niemierko, and Marsden models, respectively. The median value of calculated TCP in H&N plans was 94.0% (44.0-97.8%) and 94.3% (0.0-97.8%) with the Poisson and Niemierko models, respectively. There were significant differences between the calculated TCPs with the Marsden model in comparison with either the Poisson or Niemierko model (p < 0.001) for both lung and prostate plans. The TCPs calculated by the Poisson and Niemierko models were significantly correlated for all three tumor sites.  Conclusion::   There are variations with different radiobiological models. Understanding of the correlation and limitation of a TCP model with dosimetric parameters can help develop the meaningful objective functions for plan optimization, which would lead to the implementation of outcome-based planning. More clinical data are needed to refine and consolidate the model for accuracy and robustness.  Advances in knowledge::   This study has tested three radiobiological models with varied disease sites.

Our main objective was to investigate whether levels of post-treatment urinary sarcosine are associated with relapse. The inclusion criteria were (in accordance with EAU 2017) as follows: histopathologically verified adenocarcinoma in prostate biopsy cores or specimens from transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or prostatectomy for benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) with retained ability to urinate. The median follow-up was 53 months. In the study, we retrospectively evaluated a cohort of 511 patients with prostate cancer with various risk factors and treatment strategies. Post-treatment sarcosine levels were elevated in 266 (52%) patients and highly elevated (≥200 nmol/L) in 71 (13%) patients. Urinary sarcosine content was significantly associated with number of relapses that patients experienced, P = 0.002 for sarcosine ≥200 vs ≤30 nmol/L. Multivariate analysis revealed that sarcosine was an independent predictor of recurrent relapses (≥2 relapses with an intermediate period of remission), HR = 3.89 (95% CI 1.29-11.7) for sarcosine >200 vs <30 nmol/L. This trend was even more pronounced in a subgroup of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, HR = 3.29 (95% CI 1.06-10.18), where (single) relapse-free survival could also be predicted by sarcosine levels, HR = 1.96 (1.05-3.66).

The two-phase case-control sampling study design is widely used for the evaluation of candidate biomarkers. The sampling probabilities for cases and controls in the second phase can often depend on other covariates (sampling strata). This biased sampling can lead to invalid inference on a biomarker's classification accuracy if not properly accounted for. In this paper, we adopt the idea of inverse probability weighting and develop inverse probability weighting-based estimators for various measures of a biomarker's classification performance, including the points on the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) curve, the area under the ROC curve (area under the curve), and the partial area under the curve. In particular, we consider classification accuracy estimators using sampling weights estimated conditionally on sampling strata and further improve their efficiency through the use of estimated weights that additionally take into account the auxiliary variables available from the phase-one cohort. We develop asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and provide analytical variance for making inference. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate excellent performance of the proposed weighted estimators, while the traditional empirical estimator can be severely biased. We also investigate the advantages in efficiency gain for estimating various classification accuracy estimators through the use of auxiliary variables in addition to sampling strata and apply the proposed method to examples from a renal artery stenosis study and a prostate cancer study.""","""['Lu Wang', 'Ying Huang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Evaluating and comparing biomarkers with respect to the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve in two-phase case-control studies.', 'Combining biomarkers for classification with covariate adjustment.', 'True verification probabilities should not be used in estimating the area under receiver operating characteristic curve.', 'Optimal two-phase sampling for estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.', 'Analysis of case-cohort designs with binary outcomes: Improving efficiency using whole-cohort auxiliary information.', 'Two-phase stratified sampling and analysis for predicting binary outcomes.']"""

It is, however, still unknown whether PKCε affects cell proliferation via glucose metabolism in cancer cells. Here we report a novel function of PKCε that provides growth advantages for cancer cells by enhancing tumor cells glycolysis. We found that either PKCε or Smad2/3 promoted aerobic glycolysis, expression of the glycolytic genes encoding HIF-1α, HKII, PFKP and MCT4, and tumor cell proliferation, while overexpression of PKCε or Smad3 enhanced aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation in a protein kinase D- or TGF-β-independent manner in PC-3M and DU145 prostate cancer cells. The effects of PKCε silencing were reversed by ectopic expression of Smad3. PKCε or Smad3 ectopic expression-induced increase in cell growth was antagonized by inhibition of lactate transportation. Furthermore, interaction of endogenous PKCε with Smad2/3 was primarily responsible for phosphorylation of Ser213 in the Samd3 linker region, and resulted in Smad3 binding to the promoter of the glycolytic genes, thereby promoting cell proliferation. Forced expression of mutant Smad3 (S213A) attenuated PKCε-stimulated protein overexpression of the glycolytic genes.

However, dimensionality of imaging data, together with a great variability of nuclear shapes, presents challenges for 3D morphological analysis. Thus, there is a compelling need for robust 3D nuclear morphometric techniques to carry out population-wide analysis. We propose a new approach that combines modeling, analysis, and interpretation of morphometric characteristics of cell nuclei and nucleoli in 3D. We used robust surface reconstruction that allows accurate approximation of 3D object boundary. Then, we computed geometric morphological measures characterizing the form of cell nuclei and nucleoli. Using these features, we compared over 450 nuclei with about 1,000 nucleoli of epithelial and mesenchymal prostate cancer cells, as well as 1,000 nuclei with over 2,000 nucleoli from serum-starved and proliferating fibroblast cells. Classification of sets of 9 and 15 cells achieved accuracy of 95.4% and 98%, respectively, for prostate cancer cells, and 95% and 98% for fibroblast cells.

Blood samples were collected for comprehensive profiling of CellSearch-enriched circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Targeted CTC RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) allowed the detection of eight AR splice variants (ARV). Low-pass whole-genome and targeted gene-body sequencing of AR and TP53 was applied to identify amplifications, loss of heterozygosity, mutations, and structural rearrangements in ctDNA. Clinical or radiologic progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and independent associations were determined using multivariable Cox regression models.  Results:   Overall, no single AR perturbation remained associated with adverse prognosis after multivariable analysis. Instead, tumor burden estimates (CTC counts, ctDNA fraction, and visceral metastases) were significantly associated with PFS. TP53 inactivation harbored independent prognostic value [HR 1.88; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-3.00; P = 0.008], and outperformed ARV expression and detection of genomic AR alterations. Using Cox coefficient analysis of clinical parameters and TP53 status, we identified three prognostic groups with differing PFS estimates (median, 14.7 vs. 7.51 vs. 2.62 months; P < 0.0001), which was validated in an independent mCRPC cohort (n = 202) starting first-line ARSi (median, 14.3 vs. 6.39 vs. 2.23 months; P < 0.0001).

Materials and methods:   Total RNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 58 CaP, and 25 benign prostate hyperplasia tissues. We also studied the expression in serum from 49 localized and 21 metastatic castration-resistant CaP samples.

Results indicated that AAP-H was nontoxic and exhibited antitumor activities. Cell cycle analysis indicated that AAP-H may arrest DU-145 cells in the S phase. The role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian rapamycin target protein (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signaling pathway in the antitumor mechanism of APP-H was investigated. Results showed that AAP-H treatment led to dose-dependent reduction in the levels of p-AKT (Ser473), p-PI3K (p85), and p-mTOR (Ser2448), whereas t-AKT and t-PI3K levels remained unaltered compared to the untreated DU-145 cells. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the DU-145 cells by employing inhibitor LY294002 (10 μM) or rapamycin (20 nM) effectively attenuated AAP-H-induced phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR. At the same time, inhibitor addition further elevated AAP-H-induced cleaved-caspase-3 levels. Furthermore, the effect of AAP-H on tumor growth and the role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in nude mouse model were also investigated. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that activated AKT, PI3K, and mTOR levels were reduced in DU-145 xenografts. Western blotting showed that AAP-H treatment resulted in dose-dependent reduction in p-AKT (Ser473), p-PI3K (p85), and p-mTOR (Ser2448) levels, whereas t-AKT and t-PI3K levels remained unaltered. Similarly, Bcl-xL levels decreased, whereas that of Bax increased after AAP-H treatment. AAP-H also increased initiator (caspase 8 and 9) and executor caspase (caspase 3 and 7) levels. Therefore, the antitumor mechanism of APP-H on DU-145 cells may involve regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which eventually promotes apoptosis via mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. Thus, the hydrophobic oligopeptide (YVPGP) can be developed as an adjuvant for the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer in the future.""","""['Xiaojuan Li', 'Yunping Tang', 'Fangmiao Yu', 'Yu Sun', 'Fangfang Huang', 'Yan Chen', 'Zuisu Yang', 'Guofang Ding']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mar Drugs""","""['Anticancer Activity of Anthopleura anjunae Oligopeptides in Prostate Cancer DU-145 Cells.', 'Dual inhibition of PI3K and mTOR mitigates compensatory AKT activation and improves tamoxifen response in breast cancer.', 'Longitudinal inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling by LY294002 and rapamycin induces growth arrest of adult T-cell leukemia cells.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of Promising Drug Candidates against Prostate Cancer through Computationally-Driven Drug Repurposing.', 'Marine Natural Products with Activities against Prostate Cancer: Recent Discoveries.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'The Impact of Oxidative Stress and AKT Pathway on Cancer Cell Functions and Its Application to Natural Products.', 'KDM5B Is Essential for the Hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT Signaling in Prostate Tumorigenesis.']"""

In many countries, political authorities are considering the implementation of a simplified labelling system to reflect the nutritional quality of food products. The Nutri-Score, a five-colour nutrition label, is derived from the Nutrient Profiling System of the British Food Standards Agency (modified version) (FSAm-NPS). How the consumption of foods with high/low FSAm-NPS relates to cancer risk has been studied in national/regional cohorts but has not been characterized in diverse European populations.  Methods and findings:   This prospective analysis included 471,495 adults from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC, 1992-2014, median follow-up: 15.3 y), among whom there were 49,794 incident cancer cases (main locations: breast, n = 12,063; prostate, n = 6,745; colon-rectum, n = 5,806). Usual food intakes were assessed with standardized country-specific diet assessment methods. The FSAm-NPS was calculated for each food/beverage using their 100-g content in energy, sugar, saturated fatty acid, sodium, fibres, proteins, and fruits/vegetables/legumes/nuts. The FSAm-NPS scores of all food items usually consumed by a participant were averaged to obtain the individual FSAm-NPS Dietary Index (DI) scores. Multi-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were computed. A higher FSAm-NPS DI score, reflecting a lower nutritional quality of the food consumed, was associated with a higher risk of total cancer (HRQ5 versus Q1 = 1.07; 95% CI 1.03-1.10, P-trend < 0.001). Absolute cancer rates in those with high and low (quintiles 5 and 1) FSAm-NPS DI scores were 81.4 and 69.5 cases/10,000 person-years, respectively. Higher FSAm-NPS DI scores were specifically associated with higher risks of cancers of the colon-rectum, upper aerodigestive tract and stomach, lung for men, and liver and postmenopausal breast for women (all P < 0.05). The main study limitation is that it was based on an observational cohort using self-reported dietary data obtained through a single baseline food frequency questionnaire; thus, exposure misclassification and residual confounding cannot be ruled out.  Conclusions:   In this large multinational European cohort, the consumption of food products with a higher FSAm-NPS score (lower nutritional quality) was associated with a higher risk of cancer. This supports the relevance of the FSAm-NPS as underlying nutrient profiling system for front-of-pack nutrition labels, as well as for other public health nutritional measures.""","""['Mélanie Deschasaux', 'Inge Huybrechts', 'Neil Murphy', 'Chantal Julia', 'Serge Hercberg', 'Bernard Srour', 'Emmanuelle Kesse-Guyot', 'Paule Latino-Martel', 'Carine Biessy', 'Corinne Casagrande', 'Mazda Jenab', 'Heather Ward', 'Elisabete Weiderpass', 'Christina C Dahm', 'Kim Overvad', 'Cecilie Kyrø', 'Anja Olsen', 'Aurélie Affret', 'Marie-Christine Boutron-Ruault', 'Yahya Mahamat-Saleh', 'Rudolf Kaaks', 'Tilman Kühn', 'Heiner Boeing', 'Lukas Schwingshackl', 'Christina Bamia', 'Eleni Peppa', 'Antonia Trichopoulou', 'Giovanna Masala', 'Vittorio Krogh', 'Salvatore Panico', 'Rosario Tumino', 'Carlotta Sacerdote', 'Bas Bueno-de-Mesquita', 'Petra H Peeters', 'Anette Hjartåker', 'Charlotta Rylander', 'Guri Skeie', 'J Ramón Quirós', 'Paula Jakszyn', 'Elena Salamanca-Fernández', 'José María Huerta', 'Eva Ardanaz', 'Pilar Amiano', 'Ulrika Ericson', 'Emily Sonestedt', 'Ena Huseinovic', 'Ingegerd Johansson', 'Kay-Tee Khaw', 'Nick Wareham', 'Kathryn E Bradbury', 'Aurora Perez-Cornago', 'Konstantinos K Tsilidis', 'Pietro Ferrari', 'Elio Riboli', 'Marc J Gunter', 'Mathilde Touvier']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""PLoS Med""","""['Association between the nutrient profile system underpinning the Nutri-Score front-of-pack nutrition label and mortality in the SUN project: A prospective cohort study.', 'Association between nutritional profiles of foods underlying Nutri-Score front-of-pack labels and mortality: EPIC cohort study in 10 European countries.', 'Are self-reported unhealthy food choices associated with an increased risk of breast cancer?

The results showed that 3-BI induced a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on PC-3 cells at 24, 48 and 72 h. These effects were significantly higher than those found with DOCE at 72 h of culture. Moreover, 3-BI also potentiated the effects of DOCE in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, 3-BI showed inhibition of the migration of PC-3 cells. Nevertheless, 3-BI was not effective in the DU145 PC cell line.

Aggressive and metastatic PC results in life-threatening tumors, and represents one of the leading causes of mortality in men. Previous studies of atypical protein kinase C isoforms (aPKCs) have highlighted its role in the survival of cultured prostate cells via the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway. The present study showed that PKC‑ι was overexpressed in PC samples collected from cancer patients but not in non-invasive prostate tissues, indicating PKC‑ι as a possible prognostic biomarker for the progression of prostate carcinogenesis. Immunohistochemical staining further confirmed the association between PKC‑ι and the prostate malignancy. The DU‑145 and PC‑3 PC cell lines, and the non-neoplastic RWPE‑1 prostatic epithelial cell line were cultured and treated with aPKC inhibitors 2‑acetyl‑1,3-cyclopentanedione (ACPD) and 5-amino‑1-(1R,2S,3S,4R)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclopentyl)‑1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide (ICA‑1). Western blot data demonstrated that ICA‑1 was an effective and specific inhibitor of PKC‑ι and that ACPD inhibited PKC‑ι and PKC‑ζ. Furthermore, the two inhibitors significantly decreased malignant cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. The inhibitors showed no significant cytotoxicity towards the RWPE‑1 cells, but exhibited cytostatic effects on the DU‑145 and PC‑3 cells prior to inducing apoptosis. The inhibition of aPKCs significantly reduced the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. Furthermore, this inhibition promoted apoptosis, reduced signaling for cell survival, and reduced the proliferation of PC cells, whereas the normal prostate epithelial cells were relatively unaffected. Overall, the results suggested that PKC‑ι and PKC‑ζ are essential for the progression of PC, and that ACPD and ICA‑1 can be effectively used as potential inhibitors in targeted therapy.""","""['André H Apostolatos', 'Wishrawana S Ratnayake', 'Hla Win-Piazza', 'Christopher A Apostolatos', 'Tracess Smalley', 'Loveleen Kang', 'Raoul Salup', 'Robert Hill', 'Mildred Acevedo-Duncan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Two novel atypical PKC inhibitors; ACPD and DNDA effectively mitigate cell proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition of metastatic melanoma while inducing apoptosis.', 'Lycopene acts through inhibition of IκB kinase to suppress NF-κB signaling in human prostate and breast cancer cells.', 'Preclinical testing of 5-amino-1-((1R,2S,3S,4R)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclopentyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide: a potent protein kinase C-ι inhibitor as a potential prostate carcinoma therapeutic.', 'Targeting the oncogenic protein kinase Ciota signalling pathway for the treatment of cancer.', 'The Dual Roles of the Atypical Protein Kinase Cs in Cancer.', 'Amplified therapeutic targets in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma - a review of the literature with quantitative appraisal.', '14-3-3 and Smad2/3 are crucial mediators of atypical-PKCs: Implications for neuroblastoma progression.', 'Regulation of Inflammation-Mediated Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition with Echinochrome a for Improving Myocardial Dysfunction.', 'Protein Kinase C (PKC) Isozymes as Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Cancer.', 'Targeting Protein Kinases and Epigenetic Control as Combinatorial Therapy Options for Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

A Pareto surface approximation algorithm was implemented within the framework of Inverse Planning Simulated Annealing. The Pareto surfaces of 140 prostate cases were approximated with the proposed MCO algorithm. For each case, the Pareto surface was represented by automatically generating 300 Pareto optimal plans, and the clinically acceptable region was identified. Thus, 42 000 Pareto optimal plans were created to characterize Pareto surfaces for all the cases. In addition, the relationship between the clinically acceptable region and four anchor plans was studied. As a result, a set of polynomial regression models was extracted to rapidly predict the clinically acceptable region on the Pareto surface based on anchor plans.

Results show that the urethra is better spared with MCO planning than with standard planning (a lower mean urethral D 10 value of 2.25%). The overall MCO plan quality also outperforms the standard plan quality, since MCO planning is able to increase the frequency of clinically acceptable plans meeting all of RTOG criteria simultaneously without any human intervention (from 83.05% to 97.46%).

Materials and Methods The authors performed a retrospective study of men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer who underwent simultaneous 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI before radical prostatectomy between December 2015 and June 2017. The reference standard was whole-mount pathologic examination. Readers were blinded to radiologic and pathologic findings. Tumor localization was based on 30 anatomic regions. Region-specific sensitivity and specificity were calculated for PET/MRI and multiparametric MRI by using raw stringent and alternative neighboring approaches. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in the tumor and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 grade were compared with tumor Gleason score. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate population-averaged sensitivity and specificity and to determine the association between tumor characteristics and SUVmax or PI-RADS score. Results Thirty-two men (median age, 68 years; interquartile range: 62-71 years) were imaged. The region-specific sensitivities of PET/MRI and multiparametric MRI were 74% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 70%, 77%) and 50% (95% CI: 45%, 0.54%), respectively, with the alternative neighboring approach (P < .001 for both) and 73% (95% CI: 68%, 79%) and 69% (95% CI: 62%, 75%), respectively, with the population-averaged generalized estimating equation (P = .04). Region-specific specificity of PET/MRI was similar to that of multiparametric MRI with the alternative neighboring approach (88% [95% CI: 85%, 91%] vs 90% [95% CI: 87%, 92%], P = .99) and in population-averaged estimates (70% [95% CI: 64%, 76%] vs 70% [95% CI: 64%, 75%], P = .99).

We performed a pilot study on robot-assisted MRI-guided prostate biopsy with an emphasis on the in-depth analysis of the needle-tissue interaction in vivo. The data were acquired during in-bore transperineal prostate biopsies in patients using a 4 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) MRI-compatible robot. The anatomical structures in the pelvic area and the needle path were reconstructed from MR images, and quantitatively analyzed. We analyzed each structure individually and also proposed a mathematical model to investigate the influence of those structures in the targeting error using the mixed-model regression. The median targeting error in 188 insertions (27 patients) was 6.3 mm. Both the individual anatomical structure analysis and the mixed-model analysis showed that the deviation resulted from the contact between the needle and the skin as the main source of error. On contrary, needle bending inside the tissue (expressed as needle curvature) did not vary among insertions with targeting errors above and below the average. The analysis indicated that insertions crossing the bulbospongiosus presented a targeting error lower than the average. The mixed-model analysis demonstrated that the distance between the needle guide and the patient skin, the deviation at the entry point, and the path length inside the pelvic diaphragm had a statistically significant contribution to the targeting error (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that the errors associated with the elastic contact between the needle and the skin were more prominent than the needle bending along the insertion.

Older patients with prostate cancer (>60 years old) in The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) dataset displayed higher expression of macrophage markers (CD163 and VSIG4) which associated with higher rates of biochemical relapse. Remodeling of the collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) was associated with prostate cancer growth and invasion in the aged microenvironment. Moreover, the collagen matrix extracted from aged mice enhanced the invasiveness and proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro. Together, these results demonstrate that the aged prostatic microenvironment can regulate the growth and metastasis of malignant prostate cells, highlighting the role of resident macrophages and their polarization towards a protumorigenic phenotype, along with remodeling of the ECM.

Importantly, androgen receptor (AR) continues to be critical for prostate cancer growth and progression after ADT. One of the underlying molecular mechanisms is derepression of AR-repressed genes involved in cell cycle and proliferation after ADT. Here, the data demonstrate that C-X-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CXCR7), a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor, is an AR-repressed gene and is upregulated after ADT. AR directly regulates CXCR7 using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) gene editing. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was identified as a ligand for CXCR7, which induces expression of cell-cycle genes through activating AKT signaling pathway. Previous studies have been focused on chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 in mediating metastasis of various cancer types, including prostate cancer. The critical roles of CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in the interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironment render it a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment. The data suggest that the MIF/CXCR7/AKT pathway drives CRPC growth and metastasis independent of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. Furthermore, CXCR7 blockade in combination with anti-androgen enzalutamide inhibits CRPC tumor growth and potentially prevents metastasis. Notably, both MIF and CXCR7 are overexpressed in CRPC patient specimens and therefore are attractive therapeutic targets for these patients. IMPLICATIONS: This work suggests that CXCR7 plays more important roles than CXCR4 in CRPC progression; thus, targeting CXCR7 in combination with anti-androgen is a promising therapeutic approach for metastatic CRPC.""","""['Shahrzad Rafiei', 'Bin Gui', 'Jiaxin Wu', 'X Shirley Liu', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Li Jia']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Activation of MAPK Signaling by CXCR7 Leads to Enzalutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Combination of carmustine and selenite effectively inhibits tumor growth by targeting androgen receptor, androgen receptor-variants, and Akt in preclinical models: New hope for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cotargeting Androgen Receptor Splice Variants and mTOR Signaling Pathway for the Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Chemokine receptor CXCR7 activates Aurora Kinase A and promotes neuroendocrine prostate cancer growth.', 'Prognostic subtypes of thyroid cancer was constructed based on single cell and bulk-RNA sequencing data and verified its authenticity.', 'CXCR7 as a novel therapeutic target for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Pueraria lobata Potentially Treating Prostate Cancer on Single-Cell Level by Network Pharmacology and AutoDock: Clinical Findings and Drug Targets.', 'Dualistic roles and mechanistic insights of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases.']"""

Recently, it was found that ethanol (EtOH) induces disorganization of the Golgi complex caused by impaired function of the largest Golgi matrix protein, giantin (GOLGB1), which, in turn, alters the Golgi docking of resident Golgi proteins. Here, it is determined that in normal prostate cells, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), the known regulator of androgen receptor (AR) signaling, localizes in the cytoplasm and nucleus, while its kinase, glycogen synthase kinase β (GSK3β), primarily resides in the Golgi. Progression of prostate cancer is accompanied by Golgi scattering, translocation of GSK3β from the Golgi to the cytoplasm, and the cytoplasmic shift in HDAC6 localization. Alcohol dehydrogenase-generated metabolites induces Golgi disorganization in androgen-responsive LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells, facilitates tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model and activates anchorage-independent proliferation, migration, and cell adhesion. EtOH-treated cells demonstrate reduced giantin and subsequent cytoplasmic GSK3β; this phenomenon was validated in giantin-depleted cells. Redistribution of GSK3β to the cytoplasm results in phosphorylation of HDAC6 and its retention in the cytoplasm, which, in turn, stimulates deacetylation of HSP90, AR import into the nucleus, and secretion of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Finally, the relationship between Golgi morphology, HDAC6 cytoplasmic content, and clinicopathologic features was assessed in human prostate cancer patient specimens with and without a history of alcohol dependence.

Patients and methods:   The CWR22PC xenograft and isogenic cell line were tested for drug interactions on tumor cell growth and on the androgen receptor (AR), AR-splice variant7, and AR targets. A phase I trial had a 3 × 3 panobinostat dose-escalation design. The phase II study randomized 55 patients to panobinostat 40 mg (A arm) or 20 mg (B arm) triweekly ×2 weeks with bicalutamide 50 mg/day in 3-week cycles. The primary endpoint was to determine the percentage of radiographic progression-free (rPF) patients at 36 weeks versus historic high-dose bicalutamide.  Results:   In the model, panobinostat/bicalutamide demonstrated synergistic antitumor effect while reducing AR activity. The dose-limiting toxicity was not reached. The probability of remaining rPF exceeded protocol-specified 35% in the A arm and 47.5% and 38.5% in the B arm. The probabilities of remaining rPF were 47.5% in the A arm and 38.5% in the B arm, exceeding the protocol-specified threshold of 35%.

Another aim was to investigate whether gender or age influenced patients' willingness to change their smoking habits.  Materials and methods:   Patients with histologically malignant urologic tumors were enrolled in our questionnaire-based study from September 2013 to December 2014 in 2 urology departments. Patients were asked about their smoking habits and their general understanding of the relationship between smoking and the onset of cancer (urologic cancer and lung cancer).

There are robust pre-clinical data supporting a potential role for neuromodulatory agents in this patient population. This study assessed tacrolimus in improving erectile function recovery rates after RP (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00106392).  Aim:   To define the utility of oral tacrolimus in improving erectile function recovery after nerve sparing radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   A randomized, double-blind trial compared tacrolimus 2-3 mg daily and placebo in men undergoing RP. Patients had localized prostate cancer and excellent baseline erectile function, underwent bilateral nerve-sparing RP, and were followed up for at least 18 months after RP. Patients received study drug for 27 weeks and completed the International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain (EFD) questionnaire at baseline and serially after surgery.  Main outcome measures:   International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain score.  Results:   Data were available for 124 patients (59 tacrolimus, 65 placebo); mean age was 54.6 ± 6.2 years. No patient experienced permanent creatinine or potassium elevation. At baseline, mean EFD scores were 28.6 ± 2.1 (tacrolimus group) and 29 ± 1.5 (placebo group). By week 5, mean EFD scores had dropped to 8 ± 9.4 (tacrolimus) and 9 ± 10.7 (placebo). At 18 months, mean EFD scores were 16.0 ± 11.3 (tacrolimus) and 20.2 ± 9.0 (placebo) (P = .09). Tacrolimus failed to meet significance (hazard ratio = 0.83; P = .50), with no difference in: (i) percentage of patients achieving normal spontaneous erectile function (EFD score ≥24), (ii) time to normalization of EFD score (≥24), (iii) percentage of patients capable of intercourse in response to phosphieserase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i), and (iv) time to achieve response to PDE5i.  Clinical implications:   Despite positive animal data, oral tacrolimus as used in this trial failed to improve erectile function after nerve sparing radical prostatectomy.  Strengths & limitations:   The study is limited by a high attrition rate. The strengths include a randomized, placebo controlled design, extensive patient monitoring, use of medication diaries and a validated instrument as the primary outcome measure.

However, despite years of worldwide research, the underlying mechanism of GBX2 as well as its significance in breast cancer still remains unclear. Therefore, the present study evaluates the abilities of GBX gene silencing providing for the proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis of breast cancer cells by way of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.  Methods:   We employed a microarray analysis to screen out differentially expressed genes relative to breast cancer. Moreover, we retrieved GBX2 expression in breast cancer to find out the relationship between GBX2 expression and prognosis in breast cancer. We performed RT-qPCR to screen out cell lines with high GBX2 expression. Subsequently, both RT-qPCR and western blot analysis were employed so as to measure the combination of the mRNA and protein expressions of GBX2, β-catenin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9. The effect that GBX2 gene silencing and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway had on cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and tumorigenic ability were evaluated.  Results:   GBX2 gene was also identified having played a role in breast cancer development due to its association with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. GBX2 gene silencing was found to be an inhibitor for the mRNA and protein expressions regulating β-catenin, VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9. Cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, as well as tumorigenic ability in breast cancer were investigated and found to have been suppressed by the GBX2 gene silencing or inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Methods:   Anthropological and paleopathological studies of the skeletal remains were performed via careful macroscopic, microscopic, radiological (X-ray and CT scan), and histological investigation.  Results:   The skeleton displayed mixed osteoclastic and osteoblastic lesions that mainly involved the axial bones, in particular the sternum, the ribs, the spine, and the scapular and pelvic girdles.

Of the two isoforms, human IMPDH type 2 (hIMPDH2) is a validated molecular target for potential immunosuppressive, antiviral and anticancer chemotherapy. In search of newer hIMPDH2 inhibitors as potential anticancer agents, three novel series (A: 5-aminoisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one, B: 3,4-dimethoxyaniline and C: benzo[d]-[1,3]dioxol-5-ylmethanamine) were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro and cell-based activities. A total of 37 molecules (29-65) were screened for their in vitro hIMPDH2 inhibition, with particular emphasis on establishing their structure-activity relationship (SAR) trends. Eight compounds (hits, 30, 31, 33-35, 37, 41 and 43) demonstrated significant enzyme inhibition (>70% @ 10 μM); especially the A series molecules were more potent than B series (<70% inhibition @ 10 μM), while C series members were found to be inactive. The hIMPDH2 IC50 values for the hits ranged from 0.36 to 7.38 μM. The hits displaying >80% hIMPDH2 inhibition (30, 33, 35, 41 and 43) were further assessed for their cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma), DU145 (prostate carcinoma), U87 MG (glioblastoma astrocytoma) and a normal cell line, NIH-3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblast) using MTT assay. Most of the compounds exhibited higher cellular potency against cancer cell lines and notably lower toxicity towards NIH-3T3 cells compared to mycophenolic acid (MPA), a prototypical hIMPDH2 inhibitor. Two of the series A hits (30 and 35) were evaluated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC) assay and found to be better tolerated than MPA. The calculated/predicted molecular and physicochemical properties were satisfactory with reference to drug-likeness. The molecular docking studies clearly demonstrated crucial interactions of the hits with the cofactor-binding site of hIMPDH2, further providing critical information for refining the design strategy. The present study reports the design and discovery of structurally novel hIMPDH2 inhibitors as potential anticancer agents and provides a guide for further research on the development of safe and effective anticancer agents, especially against glioblastoma.""","""['Chetan P Shah', 'Prashant S Kharkar']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""[""Newer human inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (hIMPDH2) inhibitors as potential anticancer agents."", ""Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of Helicobacter pylori inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (HpIMPDH) inhibitors."", ""Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of Helicobacter pylori inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (HpIMPDH) inhibitors.

We aim to identify the degree to which older men are offered treatment for the condition and determine the level of unmet need within Northern Ireland (NI).  Methodology:   Analysis of data collected using a cross-sectional survey was conducted for men aged ≥60 years with data weighted to the NI population by age and deprivation. Respondents answered questions on sociodemographic factors, health-related characteristics, ability to function sexually, level of sexual interest and activity, and any treatment offered to improve erections in the last 3 years. Results are presented as proportions reporting treatment receipt, with differences by respondent characteristics assessed using chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   Among 2597 respondents, 46.5% reported erectile dysfunction. One quarter (25.8%) recalled being offered either medication, devices, or specialised services to improve erections. The offer of treatment was associated with younger age, being separated or divorced, higher number of long-term conditions, and greater interest in sex. Of men reporting erectile dysfunction and offered medication, 28.8% found them helpful and currently use them.  Conclusions:   As a result of not being offered treatment or not finding treatment useful, 93% of men reporting erectile dysfunction have no help with the condition.

The development of PRAD has been associated with abnormalities in alternative splicing (AS), a requisite biological process of gene expression in eukaryotic cells; however, the prognostic value of AS products and splicing events remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the data of splicing events and the clinical information of PRAD patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)SpliceSeq and TCGA databases, respectively. A prognostic index (PI) was generated from disease-free survival-associated splicing events (DFS-SEs), which were identified by univariate/multivariate Cox regression analysis. A total of 6,909 DFS-SEs were identified in PRAD. The corresponding genes for the DFS-SEs were significantly enriched in mitochondria and their associated pathways according to Gene Ontology annotation and in the pathways of fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and Huntington's disease according to a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. The PI for mutually exclusive exons had the greatest ability to predict the probability of five-year disease-free survival of patients with PRAD, with an area under the time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.7606. Patients with PRAD, when divided into a 'low' and a 'high' group based on their median PI for exon skip values, exhibited a marked difference in disease-free survival (low vs. high, 3,588.45±250.51 vs. 1,531.08±136.50 days; P=7.43x10-9). A correlation network between DFS-SEs of splicing factors and non-splicing factors was constructed to determine the potential mechanisms in PRAD, which included the potential regulatory interaction between the splicing event of splicing factor RNA binding motif protein 5-alternate terminator (AT)-64957 and the splicing event of non-splicing factor heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3-AT-939. In conclusion, the PIs derived from DFS-SEs are valuable prognostic factors for patients with PRAD, and the function of splicing events in PRAD deserves further exploration.""","""['Zhi-Guang Huang', 'Rong-Quan He', 'Zeng-Nan Mo']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Identification of Prognostic Biomarkers Associated with Cancer Stem Cell Features in Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'The novel transcriptomic signature of angiogenesis predicts clinical outcome, tumor microenvironment and treatment response for prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Prognostic Signature of Alternative Splicing Events in Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma Based on Spliceseq Data from 317 Cases.', 'Database Mining of Genes of Prognostic Value for the Prostate Adenocarcinoma Microenvironment Using the Cancer Gene Atlas.', 'Identification of 10 differently expressed lncRNAs as prognostic biomarkers for prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing signatures in pancreatic\u2004head cancer.', 'Temporal Modulation of Differential Alternative Splicing in HaCaT Human Keratinocyte Cell Line Chronically Exposed to Arsenic for up to 28 Wk.', 'Integrated multi-omics analysis of the clinical relevance and potential regulatory mechanisms of splicing factors in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Characterization of alternative splicing events and prognostic signatures in breast cancer.', 'Alternative splicing events implicated in carcinogenesis and prognosis of thyroid gland cancer.']"""

Method: Two PCa cell lines, LNCaP and C4-2B, were grouped as: negative control (no treatment), HIF-1α overexpression group (transfected with HIF-1α plasmids), and β-catenin silencing group (transfected with HIF-1α plasmids and β-catenin-shRNA). Cell proliferation, cycle, invasion, and radiosensitivity were measured under normal or hypoxic condition. Radiosensitivity was tested in two mice PCa models (the LNCaP orthotopic BALB/c-nu mice model and the C4-2B subcutaneous SCID mice model). Results: In both LNCaP and C4-2B cells, HIF-1α transfection led to an enhanced β-catenin nuclear translocation, while β-catenin silencing inhibited the β-catenin nuclear translocation. Enhanced β-catenin nuclear translocation caused by HIF-1α overexpression resulted in enhanced cell proliferation and invasion, altered cell cycle distribution, reduced apoptosis, and improved non-homologous-end-joining (NHEJ) repair under irradiation condition. In vivo imaging of orthotopic models showed that HIF-1α overexpression LNCaP cells produced tumors with 3-fold volume (P=0.003 1) and 2-fold wet weight (P=0.039 4) than those by negative control cells at day 21, and β-catenin silencing cells aberrantly reduced both tumor volume (P=0.000 3) and wet weight (P=0.017 5) than HIF-1α overexpression cells. In addition, C4-2B subcutaneous models showed similar tumor promotion effects induced by HIF-1α overexpression (tumor volume: P=0.000 1 and wet weight: P=0.047 3) and suppressive effects by β-catenin silencing (tumor volume: P<0.000 1 and wet weight: P=0.022 1) as LNCaP orthotopic xenograft with regard to tumor volume and wet weight.

Prostate (HR: 1.17; 95%CI: 1.01-1.35) and lung and trachea (HR: 1.48; 95%CI: 1.10-1.97) cancer survivors had an increased risk for developingCVD compared to cancer-free controls. This increased risk among lung and trachea cancer survivors remained statistically significant after including traditional cardiovascular risk factors and cancer treatment information (HR: 1.41; 95%CI: 1.06-1.89). Among prostate cancer survivors, the increased risk of incidentCVD was limited to those who received hormones and those without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Breast, non-Hodgkin,BCC, and colorectal cancer survivors showed no increasedCVD risk compared to cancer-free controls.

Functional parameters derived by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also correlated to aggressive disease. The aim of this work was to evaluate the relationship between metabolic parameters derived by FCH PET/CT and functional parameters derived by MRI.  Materials and methods:   Fourteen patients with proven prostate cancer who underwent FCH PET/CT and multiparametric MRI were enrolled. FCH PET/CT consisted in a dual phase: early pelvic list-mode acquisition and late whole-body acquisition. FCH PET/CT and multiparametric MRI examinations were registered and tumoral volume-of-interest were drawn on the largest lesion visualized on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and projected onto the different multiparametric MR images and FCH PET/CT images. Concerning the FCH uptake, kinetic parameters were extracted with the best model selected using the Akaike information criterion between the one- and two-tissue compartment models with an imaging-derived plasma input function. Other FCH uptake parameters (early SUVmean and late SUVmean) were extracted. Concerning functional parameters derived by MRI scan, cell density (ADC from diffusion weighting imaging) and vessel permeability (Ktrans and Ve using the Tofts pharmakinetic model from dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging) parameters were extracted. Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to compare parameters.  Results:   The one-tissue compartment model for kinetic analysis of PET images was selected. Concerning correlation analysis between PET parameters, K1 was highly correlated with early SUVmean (r = 0.83, p < 0.001) and moderately correlated with late SUVmean (r = 0.66, p = 0.010) and early SUVmean was highly correlated with late SUVmean (r = 0.90, p < 0.001). No significant correlation was found between functional MRI parameters. Concerning correlation analysis between PET and functional MRI parameters, K1 (from FCH PET/CT imaging) was moderately correlated with Ktrans (from perfusion MR imaging) (r = 0.55, p = 0.041).

Methods and materials:   We compared the late rectal and urinary toxicity and outcome in 179 prostate cancer patients treated with hypo-IGRT (70.2 Gy/26 fractions) and 174 non-IGRT patients (80 Gy/40 fractions). Multivariate analysis was performed to define predictors for late toxicity. 5- and 8-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed.  Results:   Mean follow-up was 81 months for hypo-IGRT and 90 months for non-IGRT group. Mainly mild late toxicity was observed: Hypo-IGRT group experienced 65 rectal (30.9% G1/G2; 6.3% G3/G4) and 105 urinary events (56% G1/G2; 4% G3/G4). 5- and 8-year RFS rates were 87.5% and 86.8% (hypo-IGRT) versus 80.4% and 66.8% (non-IGRT). 5- and 8-year OS rates were 91.3% and 82.7% in hypo-IGRT and 92.2% and 84% in non-IGRT group. Multivariate analysis showed that hypo-IGRT is a predictor for late genitourinary toxicity, whereas hypo-IGRT, acute urinary toxicity and androgen deprivation therapy are predictors for late rectal toxicity. Advanced T stage and higher Gleason score (GS) were correlated with worse RFS.  Conclusions:   A small increase in mild late toxicity, but not statistically significant increase in severe late toxicity in the hypo-IGRT group when compared with conventional non-IGRT group was observed.

AA is approved for the treatment of prostate cancer but could also be used to treat patients with Cushing syndrome (CS). Similar to humans, canine glucocorticoid synthesis requires CYP17A1, providing a useful animal model. The objective of this study was to preclinically investigate the effect of AA on adrenocortical hormone production, cell viability, and mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes in canine primary adrenocortical cell cultures (n = 9) from the adrenal glands of nine healthy dogs. The cells were incubated with AA (0.125 nM to 10 μM) for 72 hours under basal conditions and with 100 nM ACTH(1-24). Adrenocortical hormone concentrations were measured in culture medium using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, RNA was isolated from cells for subsequent real-time quantitative PCR analysis, and cell viability was assessed with an alamarBlue™ assay. AA reduced cortisol (IC50, 21.4 ± 4.6 nM) without affecting aldosterone under basal and ACTH-stimulated conditions. AA increased progesterone under basal and ACTH-stimulated conditions but reduced corticosterone under basal conditions, suggesting concurrent inhibition of 21-hydroxylation. AA did not affect the mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes and did not inhibit cell viability. In summary, primary canine adrenocortical cell culture is a useful model system for drug testing. For the treatment of CS, AA may to be superior to other steroidogenesis inhibitors due to its low toxicity.

We sought to determine the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in patients with AF and a history of cancer.  Methods and results:   ROCKET AF randomized 14 264 patients with AF to rivaroxaban or warfarin with a median follow-up of 1.9 years. Cox regression models were used to assess the association between cancer history and clinical outcomes, and the relative treatment effect of rivaroxaban vs. warfarin in these patients. A total of 640 patients enrolled in ROCKET AF had a history of cancer, with the most common types being prostate (28.6%), colorectal (16.1%), and breast (14.7%) cancer. Patients with a history of cancer were older, more frequently male, more likely to have prior vitamin K antagonist (VKA) use and had higher rates of overall bleeding [hazard ratio (HR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.47; P < 0.0001] and non-cardiovascular death (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.04-2.07; P = 0.031) compared with those with no cancer history. There were no significant associations between cancer history and stroke, venous thromboembolism, or myocardial infarction. The relative efficacy of rivaroxaban vs. warfarin for prevention of stroke/systemic embolism was similar in those with and without a history of cancer (interaction P-value = 0.21).  Conclusion:   In ROCKET AF, a history of cancer was associated with a higher risk of bleeding and non-cardiovascular death, but not ischaemic events. The relative efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin were not significantly different in patients with and without a history of cancer. The results of this study are exploratory and should be taken in context of the study population, which may not be generalizable to those with advanced malignancy.

Yet, frequency of their use and contemporary attitudes among radiation oncologists (ROs) and urologists (UROs) remain largely unknown.  Objective:   We performed a national survey of UROs and ROs to assess the perceived attitudes towards and frequency of prostate MRI and fusion biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a national survey of 915 ROs and 940 UROs about prostate MRI and fusion biopsy in 2017.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The survey queried respondents about perceptions of prostate MRI and fusion biopsy and inquired about self-reported utilization. Pearson chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify physician characteristics associated with survey responses.  Results and limitations:   The overall response rate was 37% (n=691). Both UROs and ROs demonstrated similar positive views that MRI with fusion biopsy improves PCa risk stratification (67% vs 71%; p=0.19) and fusion biopsy increases the confidence recommending active surveillance (55% vs 60%; p=0.18). Yet, only a quarter of both specialties reported frequent use of prostate MRI for treatment decisions for low- and intermediate-risk PCa. Compared with respondents practicing in community practices, those in academic practices were more likely to report using prostate MRI for low- (44% vs 19%; adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 3.96; p<0.001) and intermediate-risk PCa (42% vs 24%; adjusted OR: 2.49; p<0.001). Our study was limited by a modestly lower response rate.  Conclusions:   While both specialties have perceived value in favor of prostate MRI and fusion biopsy, only a quarter of respondents report their use in clinical practice. Physicians practicing in academic medical centers had greater self-reported use.  Patient summary:   Magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate and targeted biopsies have growing evidence of their use as a superior diagnostic methodology for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment decisions.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of pelvic dimensions (PD) on Positive surgical margins (PSM) rate in Afro-Caribbean population after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).  Patients and methods:   Preoperative pelvic MRI of all patients who have had RALP at the University Hospital Center of Guadeloupe between January 2013 and December 2015 was retrospectively analyzed. PD, including the Height of the upper edge of the prostate (HP), the Apical Depth (AD) and Ischial Spines Distance (ISD), and indexes (prostate volumetric index [ISD/VP], apical depth index [ISD/AD] and prostate depth index [ISD/(AD/HP)]) were compared according to the presence or absence of PSM with uni and multivariate analysis.  Results:   One hundred and seventy-eight patients were included in the study, of whom 60 (33.7%) presented PSM. In univariate analysis, significant differences between the presence or absence of PSM were observed on the AD (30.3±8.7mm versus 24.8±8.0mm, P<0.001), the HP (9.5±8.5mm versus 16.8±11.9mm, P<0.001) and the ISD (89.6±8.8mm versus 96.1±8.4mm) as well as the indexes of apical depth and prostatic depth. In multivariate logistic regression, the ISD (P<0.001) and HP (P=0.02) were associated with increased likelihood of PSM, but not AD or indexes.  Conclusion:   This study suggests that interspinous distance is the best predictor of PSM during RALP in Afro-Caribbean patients.

Twelve sex- and age-matched controls without significant aortoiliac disease were used for comparison. Exclusion criteria included neurogenic bladder dysfunction, bladder or prostate cancer, prostatic surgery, pelvic radiotherapy, or chronic treatment for LUTS. Participants underwent urological examination, including assessment of International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), uroflowmetry, postvoid residual (PVR), and prostate volume. Urine samples were collected, and levels of neuroinflammatory (nerve growth factor, NGF), inflammatory (cytokines), and oxidative stress markers (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  Results:   Groups were similar for age, PVR, prostate volume, and most cardiovascular risk factors.

However, the biological functions of circRNAs in PCa are still largely unknown.  Methods:   Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry were performed to characterize the circ-102004 expression in both human PCa tissues and cell lines. The apoptosis and cell cycle status of prostate immortalized cell lines that were overexpressed with circ-102004 by transfection was analyzed using flow cytometry. The scratch test and the Transwell assay were conducted to evaluate the ability of transfected cells to migrate and invade. RNA sequencing, pathway analysis, and Western blotting were performed to probe the associations of circ-102004 with the classical cancer signaling pathways after functionally evaluating circ-102004 in a xenograft tumor model.  Results:   In the present study, circ-102004 expression was found to be significantly higher in PCa samples than in the matched normal tissues. In functional experiments, circ-102004 is shown to play an oncogenic role in PCa by stimulating cancer cell migration and invasion.

However, whether Capn4 is involved in prostate cancer remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression, biological function and regulatory mechanism of Capn4 in prostate cancer. Herein, we found that Capn4 was highly expressed in prostate cancer cell lines compared with normal prostate cells. Capn4 gene silencing markedly suppressed the growth, invasion and Wnt/β-catenin signaling of prostate cancer cells, whereas Capn4 overexpression showed an oncogenic effect. Moreover, silencing of β-catenin significantly blocked the oncogenic effect of Capn4 overexpression. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that Capn4 was a potential target gene of microRNA-520b (miR-520b), which has been reported as a tumor suppressive miRNA in various cancers. The dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-520b directly bound to the 3'-untranslated region of Capn4. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis showed that miR-520b negatively regulated Capn4 expression in prostate cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, we found that miR-520b was significantly downregulated in prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. In addition, miR-520b expression was inversely correlated with Capn4 expression in prostate cancer clinical specimens. Overexpression of miR-520b mimicked the tumor suppressive effect of Capn4 siRNA, whereas inhibition of miR-520b had an oncogenic effect. Restoration of Capn4 significantly blocked the antitumor effect of miR-520b in prostate cancer cells. Overall, our findings demonstrate an oncogenic role of Capn4 in prostate cancer and show that its expression is epigenetically regulated by miR-520b. Our results reveal that suppression of Capn4 by miR-520b inhibits the growth and invasion of prostate cancer cells associated with downregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, indicating an important role of the miR-520b/Capn4/Wnt/β-catenin regulation axis in the molecular pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Our study suggests that miR-520b and Capn4 may represent potential and novel therapeutic targets for prostate cancer.""","""['Wei Ren', 'Dong Wang', 'Chan Li', 'Tao Shu', 'Wei Zhang', 'Xiaoliang Fu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['MicroRNA-504 functions as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma through inhibiting Frizzled-7-mediated-Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'SOX30, a target gene of miR-653-5p, represses the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells through inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Suppression of microRNA-454 impedes the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells by promoting N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 and inhibiting WNT/β-catenin signaling.', 'Non-coding RNA-based therapeutics in cancer therapy: An emphasis on Wnt/β-catenin control.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade: A promising target for glioma therapy.', 'FGF16 regulated by miR-520b enhances the cell proliferation of lung cancer.', 'The circRNA circIFI30 promotes progression of triple-negative breast cancer and correlates with prognosis.', 'MLK3 is a newly identified microRNA-520b target that regulates liver cancer cell migration.', 'URG11 promotes proliferation and induced apoptosis of LNCaP cells.']"""

Many active surveillance programs are limited to men with Grade Group 1 (Gleason 6) disease and prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml. However, recent guidelines state that active surveillance can be considered in cases of limited Grade Group 2 (Gleason 3 + 4) despite limited data on outcomes. We compared prostatectomy outcomes between prostate cancer subgroups of intermediate risk vs low risk.  Materials and methods:   We performed an observational study in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden, which includes 98% of prostate cancer cases nationwide. From 2009 to 2012 radical prostatectomy was performed in 5,087 men with low risk prostate cancer (Grade Group 1, prostate specific antigen less than 10 ng/ml and cT2 or less) and intermediate risk prostate cancer (Grade Group 2, prostate specific antigen 10 to 20 ng/ml or T2). We compared upgrading and up staging between the groups based on the CAPRA (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment) scores and published active surveillance criteria. Results were validated in an independent data set of cases diagnosed from 2013 to 2016.  Results:   Men with Grade Group 1, prostate specific antigen 10 to 15 ng/ml and prostate specific antigen density less than 0.15 ng/ml/cm did not significantly differ in upgrading or adverse pathology findings compared to men with low risk prostate cancer. Prostate specific antigen greater than 15 ng/ml or Grade Group 2 was associated with a significantly greater risk of aggressive prostate cancer. Men with low risk CAPRA scores (0 to 2) and Grade Group 2 disease were at almost threefold increased risk of upgrading and twofold increased risk of adverse pathology compared to men with low risk CAPRA, Grade Group 1 disease.  Conclusions:   Expanding the prostate specific antigen threshold to 15 ng/ml for Grade Group 1 prostate cancer would allow more men to elect active surveillance. This is unlikely to compromise outcomes, particularly if prostate specific antigen density is low. In contrast, caution should be exercised in offering active surveillance to men with prostate specific antigen greater than 15 ng/ml or Grade Group 2 prostate cancer.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'Yasin Folkvaljon', 'Ola Bratt', 'David Robinson', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Population based study of predictors of adverse pathology among candidates for active surveillance with Gleason 6 prostate cancer.', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network® Favorable Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer-Is Active Surveillance Appropriate?', 'Pathological Outcome following Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Prostate Specific Antigen Greater than 10 ng/ml and Histologically Favorable Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: How to Do It Right.', 'Prognostic Value of the Intermediate-risk Feature in Men with Favorable Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Incorporating VR-RENDER Fusion Software in Robot-Assisted Partial Prostatectomy: The First Case Report.', 'Percentage Gleason pattern 4 and PI-RADS score predict upgrading in biopsy Grade Group 2 prostate cancer patients without cribriform pattern.', 'Metastasis and Mortality in Men With Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance.', 'Active surveillance for intermediate-risk prostate cancer.']"""

Hospitalized bleeding risk was similar with direct acting oral anticoagulants vs. warfarin. Relative hospitalized bleeding risk varied by cancer type and anticoagulant choice. SUMMARY: Background Direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are associated with less bleeding than traditional venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatments in the general population but are little studied in cancer-associated VTE (CA-VTE). Objective To determine whether different anticoagulation strategies for CA-VTE have different hospitalized bleeding rates. Patients/Methods We conducted a retrospective study of patients with CA-VTE, diagnosed between 2011 and 2015, in a large administrative database. Using validated algorithms, we identified 26 894 CA-VTE patients treated with anticoagulants and followed them for hospitalized severe bleeding. Cox models were used to assess bleeding risk, adjusted for age, sex, high dimensional propensity score and frailty. Results Over 27 281 person-years of follow-up (median 0.6 years), 1204 bleeding events occurred, for a bleeding rate of 4.4% per patient-year. Bleeding rates varied by cancer type, with the highest rate for upper gastrointestinal cancers (8.6%) and the lowest for breast cancer (2.9%). In Cox models (hazard ratio [HR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]), compared with warfarin, DOACS and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) had similar hazards of bleeding (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.69-1.11 and 0.98; 0.85-1.13). Compared with LMWH, there was no difference in hazard of bleeding with DOACs (0.86; 0.66-1.12). There was heterogeneity in bleeding risk with DOACs by cancer type, with a higher risk of bleeding in upper gastrointestinal cancers and lower risk of bleeding in prostate cancer and hematologic cancers. Conclusions In this practice-based sample of CA-VTE patients, DOACs were associated with similar bleeding risks to warfarin and LMWH. These findings suggest a complex association of bleeding risk with anticoagulant choice in cancer patients.""","""['N A Zakai', 'R F Walker', 'R F MacLehose', 'T J Adam', 'A Alonso', 'P L Lutsey']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Thromb Haemost""","""['Recurrent venous thromboembolism in anticoagulated patients with cancer: management and short-term prognosis.', 'Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Direct-acting Oral Anticoagulants and Warfarin in Patients with Venous Thromboembolism and Active Cancer: An Observational Analysis.', 'Risk Stratification for Bleeding Complications in Patients With Venous Thromboembolism: Application of the HAS-BLED Bleeding Score During the First 6\xa0Months of Anticoagulant Treatment.', 'Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) versus low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis (which agent for which patient).', 'Venous thromboembolism in cancer patients.', 'How to Treat Today?

In this sense, chemists carry out preclinical assays with a high number of combinations of experimental conditions (c j). In fact, ChEMBL database contains outcomes of 65 534 different anticancer activity preclinical assays for 35 565 different chemical compounds (1.84 assays per compound). These assays cover different combinations of c j formed from >70 different biological activity parameters ( c0), >300 different drug targets ( c1), >230 cell lines ( c2), and 5 organisms of assay ( c3) or organisms of the target ( c4). It include a total of 45 833 assays in leukemia, 6227 assays in breast cancer, 2499 assays in ovarian cancer, 3499 in colon cancer, 3159 in lung cancer, 2750 in prostate cancer, 601 in melanoma, etc. This is a very complex data set with multiple Big Data features. This data is hard to be rationalized by researchers to extract useful relationships and predict new compounds. In this context, we propose to combine perturbation theory (PT) ideas and machine learning (ML) modeling to solve this combinatorial-like problem. In this work, we report a PTML (PT + ML) model for ChEMBL data set of preclinical assays of anticancer compounds. This is a simple linear model with only three variables. The model presented values of area under receiver operating curve = AUROC = 0.872, specificity = Sp(%) = 90.2, sensitivity = Sn(%) = 70.6, and overall accuracy = Ac(%) = 87.7 in training series. The model also have Sp(%) = 90.1, Sn(%) = 71.4, and Ac(%) = 87.8 in external validation series. The model use PT operators based on multicondition moving averages to capture all the complexity of the data set. We also compared the model with nonlinear artificial neural network (ANN) models obtaining similar results. This confirms the hypothesis of a linear relationship between the PT operators and the classification as anticancer compounds in different combinations of assay conditions. Last, we compared the model with other PTML models reported in the literature concluding that this is the only one PTML model able to predict activity against multiple types of cancer. This model is a simple but versatile tool for the prediction of the targets of anticancer compounds taking into consideration multiple combinations of experimental conditions in preclinical assays.""","""['Harbil Bediaga', 'Sonia Arrasate', 'Humbert González-Díaz']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""ACS Comb Sci""","""['Multioutput Perturbation-Theory Machine Learning (PTML) Model of ChEMBL Data for Antiretroviral Compounds.', 'PTML Model for Selection of Nanoparticles, Anticancer Drugs, and Vitamins in the Design of Drug-Vitamin Nanoparticle Release Systems for Cancer Cotherapy.', 'Perturbation Theory/Machine Learning Model of ChEMBL Data for Dopamine Targets: Docking, Synthesis, and Assay of New l-Prolyl-l-leucyl-glycinamide Peptidomimetics.', 'General theory for multiple input-output perturbations in complex molecular systems. 1.

CuV was further detected in a proportion of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)/mycosis fungoides skin samples and in one melanoma.  Patients and methods:   With novel multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction and antibody assays, we studied 3 patient groups for BuV, TuV, and CuV DNA and immunoglobulin G (IgG): CTCL patients, immunosuppressed solid-organ transplant recipients, and immunocompetent healthy adults.  Results:   CuV DNA was detected in skin biopsies of 4/25 (16.0%) CTCL and 4/136 (2.9%) transplant patients but not in any of 159 skin samples of 98 healthy adults. The dermal CuV-DNA prevalence was significantly higher in CTCL patients than in the other subjects. CuV DNA was further detected in healthy skin of 4 organ transplant recipients, 2 of whom also had CuV-positive skin carcinomas. One CTCL patient harbored CuV DNA in both malignant (CTCL, melanoma) and nonmalignant skin and sentinel lymph nodes but not in his prostate. The CuV IgG seroprevalences were among CTCL patients 9.5% (4/42), transplant recipients 6.5% (8/124), and healthy adults 3.8% (3/78).

Patients and methods:   In all, 104 patients with prostate cancer, aged 48-84 years initiating ADT, were randomised to immediate exercise (IMEX, n = 54) or delayed exercise (DEL, n = 50) conditions. The former consisted of 6 months of supervised resistance/aerobic/impact exercise and the latter comprised 6 months of usual care followed by 6 months of the identical exercise programme. Regional and whole body BMD, lean mass (LM), whole body FM and trunk FM, and appendicular skeletal muscle (ASM) were assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry, and muscle density by peripheral quantitative computed tomography at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months.  Results:   There was a significant time effect (P < 0.001) for whole body, spine and hip BMD with a progressive loss in the IMEX and DEL groups, although lumbar spine BMD was largely preserved in the IMEX group at 6 months compared with the DEL group (-0.4% vs -1.6%). LM, ASM, and muscle density were preserved in the IMEX group at 6 months, declined in the DEL group at 6 months (-1.4% to -2.5%) and then recovered at 12 months after training. FM and trunk FM increased (P < 0.001) over the 12-month period in the IMEX (7.8% and 4.5%, respectively) and DEL groups (6.5% and 4.3%, respectively).

The impact of small field dose inaccuracy on dose verification methods has not been studied yet. The aim of this work is therefore to quantify the relationship between the uncertainty of a 2D pre-treatment dose prediction model and the proportion of dose coming from small fields in VMAT arcs for a range of clinical plans. The model evaluated in this work predicts 2D portal dose images (PDIs) without a patient or phantom in the beam. The uncertainty of the model was calculated through simulation of model parameter deviations. The proportion of dose from small fields in a VMAT arc was determined by comparing a PDI with only dose from small fields with the original PDI. The uncertainty and proportion of dose from small fields were calculated for 109 VMAT arcs (41 head and neck, 33 lung, 35 prostate). The correlation was assessed with a linear regression. There is a statistically significant positive correlation between the uncertainty of the model and the proportion of dose from small fields in a VMAT arc, for each treatment site individually, as well as for all tumor sites together. The strongest relationship is found for the prostate cases. As there is a positive relationship between the uncertainty of the 2D pre-treatment dose prediction model, it may be wise to limit the dose from small fields in VMAT arcs, to avoid additional uncertainty in the dose verification process.""","""['Cecile J A Wolfs', 'Ans C C Swinnen', 'Sebastiaan M J J G Nijsten', 'Frank Verhaegen']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Validation and uncertainty analysis of a pre-treatment 2D dose prediction model.', 'EPID-based in\xa0vivo dosimetry using Dosimetry Check™: Overview and clinical experience in a 5-yr study including breast, lung, prostate, and head and neck cancer patients.', 'Assessing the feasibility of volumetric-modulated arc therapy using simultaneous integrated boost (SIB-VMAT): An analysis for complex head-neck, high-risk prostate and rectal cancer cases.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'Set-up verification using portal imaging; review of current clinical practice.', 'Selection Strategy of Jaw Tracking in VMAT Planning for Lung SBRT.', 'Operation and calibration of the novel PTW 1600SRS detector for the verification of single isocenter stereotactic radiosurgery treatments of multiple small brain metastases.', 'Future directions of in vivo dosimetry for external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy.', 'Limiting treatment plan complexity by applying a novel commercial tool.']"""

Methods:   A total of 602 patients who received primary androgen deprivation therapy were entered into the Korean Cancer Study of the Prostate database. The effect of prognostic factors was determined by multivariate analysis. For each patient, the weight of all factors was totaled to give Korean Cancer Study-prostate scores; patients were divided into three risk groups according to their score. The probability of castration-resistant prostate cancer, cancer-specific survival and overall survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results:   On multivariate analysis for castration-resistant prostate cancer, the significant variables were initial prostate-specific antigen (>40 ng/mL; 1 point), biopsy Gleason score (≥9; 1 point), clinical N1 (1 point), and non-regional lymph node (1 point), bone (1 point) and visceral (1 point) metastasis. The Korean Cancer Study-prostate scoring model was calculated on a scale of 0-6 (0: low, 1-2: intermediate, ≥3: high risk). The risk groups stratified castration-resistant prostate cancer (P < 0.0001), cancer-specific survival (P < 0.0001) and overall survival (P < 0.0001) by Kaplan-Meier curve.

The aim of this study was to determine the HTLV-1 and XMRV coinfection for the first time in Iranian patients who were admitted to the Tehran hospitals.  Materials and methods:   Two hundred and ninety one patients suspected with HTLV-1 were referred to the hospitals affiliated to the Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran from April 2012 to October 2016. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells/cerebrospinal fluids was extracted by High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche, Germany). After complementary DNA synthesis, conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of HTLV-1 or XMRV-infected patients.

SPOP directly interacts with CYCLIN E1 and specific regulates its stability in prostate cancer cell lines. SPOP/CUL3/RBX1 complex regulates CYCLIN E1 stability through poly-ubiquitination. CDK2 competes with SPOP for CYCLIN E1 interaction, suggesting that SPOP probably regulates the stability of CDK2-free CYCLIN E1. CYCLIN E1 expression rescued proliferation, migration, and tumor formation of prostate cancer cell suppressed by SPOP. Furthermore, we found SPOP selectively regulates the substrates' stability and signaling pathways in prostate cancer and CCRC cell lines, suggesting that complicated mechanisms exist for SPOP to regulate substrate specificity. Altogether, we have revealed a novel mechanism for SPOP in suppressing prostate cancer and provided evidence to show SPOP has dual functions in prostate cancer and CCRC.""","""['Lin-Gao Ju', 'Yuan Zhu', 'Qiao-Yun Long', 'Xue-Jing Li', 'Xiang Lin', 'Shan-Bo Tang', 'Lei Yin', 'Yu Xiao', 'Xing-Huan Wang', 'Lianyun Li', 'Lei Zhang', 'Min Wu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cell Death Differ""","""['Dysregulation of INF2-mediated mitochondrial fission in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer.', 'SPOP mutation drives prostate neoplasia without stabilizing oncogenic transcription factor ERG.', 'SPOP regulates prostate epithelial cell proliferation and promotes ubiquitination and turnover of c-MYC oncoprotein.', 'The Roles of SPOP in DNA Damage Response and DNA Replication.', 'The emerging role of SPOP protein in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.', 'Identification of novel and potent dual-targeting HDAC1/SPOP inhibitors using structure-based virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation and evaluation of in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity.', 'Cul3 substrate adaptor SPOP targets Nup153 for degradation.', 'E3 ubiquitin ligases in cancer stem cells: key regulators of cancer hallmarks and novel therapeutic opportunities.', 'O-GlcNAcylation of SPOP promotes carcinogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'SPOP mutations promote tumor immune escape in endometrial cancer via the IRF1-PD-L1 axis.']"""

Using a systems biology approach, we interrogated the AR-regulated proteome and identified PDZ binding kinase (PBK) as a novel AR-regulated protein that regulates full-length AR and AR variants (ARVs) activity in PrCa. PBK overexpression in aggressive PrCa is associated with early biochemical relapse and poor clinical outcome. In addition to its carboxy terminus ligand-binding domain, PBK directly interacts with the amino terminus transactivation domain of the AR to stabilise it thereby leading to increased AR protein expression observed in PrCa. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that PBK is a mediator of global AR signalling with key roles in regulating tumour invasion and metastasis. PBK inhibition decreased growth of PrCa cell lines and clinical specimen cultured ex vivo.

We characterized 111In-DOTA-5D3 by SPECT/CT imaging, tissue biodistribution studies, and dosimetry. Methods: Radiolabeling, stability, cell uptake, and internalization of 111In-DOTA-5D3 were performed by established techniques. Biodistribution and SPECT imaging were done on male nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice bearing human PSMA(+) PC3 PIP and PSMA(-) PC3 flu prostate cancer xenografts on the upper right and left flanks, respectively, at 2, 24, 48, 72, and 192 h after injection. Biodistribution was also evaluated in tumor-free, healthy male CD-1 mice. Blocking studies were performed by coinjection of a 10-fold and 50-fold excess of 5D3 followed by biodistribution at 24 h to determine PSMA binding specificity. The absorbed radiation doses were calculated on the basis of murine biodistribution data, which were translated to a human adult man using organ weights as implemented in OLINDA/EXM. Results:111In-DOTA-5D3 was synthesized with specific activity of approximately 2.24 ± 0.74 MBq/μg (60.54 ± 20 μCi/μg). Distribution of 111In-DOTA-5D3 in PSMA(+) PC3 PIP tumor peaked at 24 h after injection and remained high until 72 h. Uptake in normal tissues, including the blood, spleen, liver, heart, and lungs, was highest at 2 h after injection. Coinjection of 111In-DOTA-5D3 with a 10- and 50-fold excess of nonradiolabeled antibody significantly reduced PSMA(+) PC3 PIP tumor and salivary gland uptake at 24 h but did not reduce uptake in kidneys and lacrimal glands. Significant clearance of 111In-DOTA-5D3 from all organs occurred at 192 h. The highest radiation dose was received by the liver (0.5 mGy/MBq), followed by the spleen and kidneys. Absorbed radiation doses to the salivary and lacrimal glands and bone marrow were low.

Objective:   To determine whether baseline PSA level during midlife predicts risk of aggressive PCa in black men.  Design, setting, and participants:   Nested case-control study among black men in the Southern Community Cohort Study recruited between 2002 and 2009. A prospective cohort in the southeastern USA with recruitment from community health centers. A total of 197 incident PCa patients aged 40-64 yr at study entry and 569 controls matched on age, date of blood draw, and site of enrollment. Total PSA was measured in blood collected and stored at enrollment.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Total and aggressive PCa (91 aggressive: Gleason ≥7, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III/IV, or PCa-specific death). Exact conditional logistic regression estimated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for PCa by category of baseline PSA.  Results and limitations:   Median PSA among controls was 0.72, 0.80, 0.94, and 1.03ng/ml for age groups 40-49, 50-54, 55-59, and 60-64 yr, respectively; 90th percentile levels were 1.68, 1.85, 2.73, and 3.33ng/ml. Furthermore, 95% of total and 97% of aggressive cases had baseline PSA above the age-specific median. Median follow-up was 9 yr. The OR for total PCa comparing PSA >90th percentile versus ≤median was 83.6 (95% CI, 21.2-539) for 40-54 yr and 71.7 (95% CI, 23.3-288) for 55-64 yr. For aggressive cancer, ORs were 174 (95% CI, 32.3-infinity) for 40-54 yr and 51.8 (95% CI, 11.0-519) for 55-64 yr. A composite endpoint of aggressive PCa based on stage, grade, and mortality was used and is a limitation.  Conclusions:   PSA levels in midlife strongly predicted total and aggressive PCa among black men. PSA levels among controls were similar to those among white controls in prior studies.

Prospectively evaluated diagnostic assays are necessary to ensure efficacy and clinical adoption.  Objective:   Performance and utility assessment of ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) (EPI) urine exosome gene expression assay versus standard clinical parameters for discriminating Grade Group (GG) ≥2 PCa from GG1 PCa and benign disease on initial biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A two-phase adaptive clinical utility study (NCT03031418) comparing EPI results with biopsy outcomes in men, with age ≥50 yr and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 2-10ng/ml, scheduled for initial prostate biopsy. After EPI performance assessment during phase I, a clinical implementation document (ie, CarePath) was developed for utilizing the EPI test in phase II, where the biopsy decision is uncertain.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Performance evaluation of the EPI test in patients enrolled in phase I and publication of a consensus CarePath for phase II.  Results and limitations:   In a total of 503 patients, with median age of 64 yr, median PSA 5.4ng/ml, 14% African American, 70% Caucasian, 53% positive biopsy rate (22% GG1, 17% GG2, and 15% ≥ GG3), EPI was superior to an optimized model of standard clinical parameters with an area under the curve (AUC) 0.70 versus 0.62, respectively, comparable with previously published results (n=519 patients, EPI AUC 0.71). Validated cut-point 15.6 would avoid 26% of unnecessary prostate biopsies and 20% of total biopsies, with negative predictive value (NPV) 89% and missing 7% of ≥GG2 PCa. Alternative cut-point 20 would avoid 40% of unnecessary biopsies and 31% of total biopsies, with NPV 89% and missing 11% of ≥GG2 PCa. The clinical investigators reached consensus recommending use of the 15.6 cut-point for phase II. Outcome of the decision impact cohort in phase II will be reported separately.  Conclusions:   EPI is a noninvasive, easy-to-use, gene expression urine assay, which has now been successfully validated in over 1000 patients across two prospective validation trials to stratify risk of ≥GG2 from GG1 cancer and benign disease. The test improves identification of patients with higher grade disease and would reduce the total number of unnecessary biopsies.  Patient summary:   It is challenging to predict which men are likely to have high-grade prostate cancer (PCa) at initial biopsy with prostate-specific antigen 2-10ng/ml. This study further demonstrates that the ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) test can predict ≥GG2 PCa at initial biopsy and defer unnecessary biopsies better than existing risk calculator's and standard clinical data.""","""['James McKiernan', 'Michael J Donovan', 'Eric Margolis', 'Alan Partin', 'Ballentine Carter', 'Gordon Brown', 'Phillipp Torkler', 'Mikkel Noerholm', 'Johan Skog', 'Neal Shore', 'Gerry Andriole', 'Ian Thompson', 'Peter Carroll']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Towards Next-generation Urine-based Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification.', 'Re: A Prospective Adaptive Utility Trial to Validate Performance of a Novel Urine Exosome Gene Expression Assay to Predict High-grade Prostate Cancer in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen 2-10ng/ml at Initial Biopsy.', 'A Novel Urine Exosome Gene Expression Assay to Predict High-grade Prostate Cancer at Initial Biopsy.', 'Predicting high-grade prostate cancer at initial biopsy: clinical performance of the ExoDx (EPI) Prostate Intelliscore test in three independent prospective studies.', 'A urine-based Exosomal gene expression test stratifies risk of high-grade prostate Cancer in men with prior negative prostate biopsy undergoing repeat biopsy.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

Objective:   We examined whether these practice changes have led to observed improvements in EF rates over time.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified 2364 patients treated with either open or minimally-invasive RP at a single academic center in 2008-2015. To mitigate confounding by the surgical learning curve, only patients treated by surgeons who performed at least 100 procedures were considered.  Intervention:   EF before and after RP was assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function 6 (IIEF-6), with recovery defined as IIEF-6 ≥24.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We analyzed EF recovery rates of patients treated with bilateral nerve-sparing surgery and free from adjuvant/salvage treatment at the time of EF assessment. Local polynomial regression analyses explored changes in the outcomes over time. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the influence of year of surgery on baseline variables and EF recovery.  Results and limitations:   We observed a significant decrease over time of the EF recovery rates at both 12 and 24mo post-RP (all p=0.01). However, patient's age at surgery increased over time (mean increase of 0.5 per year; p<0.01), with a resultant increase in risk of comorbidity (odds ratio [OR]=1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.15; p=0.008) and thus decrease in baseline IIEF-6 score (0.35 points per year; p=0.0003). After accounting for baseline and pathological characteristics, urinary function, and type of surgery in a multivariable analysis, year of surgery was not associated with EF recovery (12mo: OR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.91-1.03, p=0.4; 24mo: OR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.91-1.03, p=0.3).  Conclusions:   Findings from a high-volume center suggest that, despite the advancements in surgical and postoperative care, EF outcomes after RP have not improved over the last decade. Additional strategies are required to improve EF recovery after RP.

In this retrospective study, we explored clinical and pathologic factors that could predict response to consecutive treatment with enzalutamide (ENZA) after disease progression (PD) on abiraterone acetate and prednisone (AA/P).  Patients and methods:   Data were collected from 40 consecutive patients with mCRPC who were treated with ENZA without other interim therapy after progression on AA/P.  Results:   The median time from prostate cancer initial diagnosis to AA/P treatment was 6.2 (range, 0.9-16.3) years. The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) from treatment initiation was 8.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.1-10.1 months) and 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.8-3.4 months) on AA/P and ENZA, respectively. The median time to PD from treatment initiation was 9.7 months (95% CI, 7.1-12.4 months) and 3 months (95% CI, 2.3-4.1 months) on AA/P and ENZA, respectively. The correlations were weak between the best percent change in PSA on ENZA and time from diagnosis to AA/P initiation, best absolute or percentage change in PSA on AA/P, time to PSA progression or PD on AA/P. Patients with longer than the median duration of treatment with AA/P (11.73 months) had longer PSA-PFS on ENZA (median 2.8 vs. 1.9 months; P = .035).  Conclusions:   In this retrospective analysis, we did not find any clinical or pathologic factors associated with response to ENZA administered consecutively after AA/P.

Increasingly, patients are utilising online cancer support groups (OCSG) to express themselves. Currently there is no method of analysis of these sophisticated data sources. We have used the PRIME-2 (Patient Reported Information Multidimensional Exploration version 2) framework for automated identification and intelligent analysis of decision-making, functional and emotional outcomes in men undergoing ORP vs. RARP from OCSG discussions.  Methods:   The PRIME-2 framework was developed to retrospectively analyse individualised patient-reported information from 5,157 patients undergoing RARP and 579 ORP. The decision factors, side effects, and emotions in 2 groups were analysed and compared using Chi-squared, t tests, and Pearson correlation.  Results:   There were no differences in Gleason score, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), and age between the groups. Surgeon experience and preservation of erectile function (P < 0.01) were important factors in the decision making process. There were no significant differences in urinary, sexual, or bowel symptoms between ORP and RARP on a monthly basis during the initial 12 months. Emotions expressed by patients undergoing RARP were more consistent and positive while ORP expressed more negative emotions at the time of surgery and 3 months postsurgery (P < 0.05), due to pain and discomfort, and during ninth month due to fear and anxiety of pending PSA tests.  Conclusions:   ORP and RARP demonstrated similar side effect profiles for 12 months, but PRIME-2 enables identification of important quality of life features and emotions over time.

We assess whether Black race remains associated with CaP and Gleason ≥3 + 4 CaP, after adjusting for clinical setting and socioeconomic and clinical factors at prostate biopsy, with a focus on men aged 40-54 years, who may be excluded from current screening guidelines.  Methods:   We recruited 564 men age 40-79 undergoing initial prostate biopsy for abnormal PSA or digital rectal examination (DRE) from three publicly funded and two private hospitals from 2009-2014. Univariate and multivariate analyses examined the associations between hospital type, race, West African Ancestry (WAA), clinical, and sociodemographic risk factors with CaP diagnosis and Gleason ≥3 + 4 CaP. Given changes in CaP screening recommendations, we also assess the multivariate analyses for men aged 40-54.  Results:   Black and White men had similar age, BMI, and prostate volume. Black men had higher PSA (8.10 ng/mL vs. 5.63 ng/mL) and PSA density (0.22 ng/mL/cm3 vs. 0.15 ng/mL/cm3, all p < 0.001). Blacks had higher frequency of CaP (63.1% vs. 41.5%, p<0.001) and Gleason ≥3+4 CaP relative to Whites in both public (27.7% vs 11.6%, p<0.001) and private (48.4% vs 21.6%, p = 0.002) settings. In models adjusted for age, first degree family history, prostate volume, 5-ARI use, hospital type, income, marital and educational status, Black race was independently associated with overall CaP diagnosis (OR = 2.13, p = 0.002). There was a significant multiplicative interaction with Black race and abnormal DRE for Gleason ≥3 + 4 CaP (OR = 2.93, p = 0.01). WAA was not predictive of overall or significant CaP among Black men. Black race (OR = 5.66, p = 0.02) and family history (OR = 4.98, p = 0.01) were independently positively associated with overall CaP diagnosis for men aged 40 to 54.  Conclusions:   Black race is independently associated with CaP and Gleason ≥3+4 CaP after accounting for clinical and socioeconomic risk factors including clinical setting and WAA, and has a higher odds ratio of CaP diagnosis in younger men.

In our RNAi approach, bioconjugation of linear, V-, and Y-shaped RNA templates were designed using a series of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids to improve cell uptake and knockdown efficacy of the oncogenic glucose regulated proteins (GRPs) in prostate (PC-3) cancer cells. An optimized HCTU-coupling procedure was developed for tagging variable saturated and unsaturated fatty acids onto the 5'-ends of linear and V-shaped RNA templates that were constructed by semiautomated solid phase RNA synthesis. Hybridization and self-assembly of complementary strands yielded linear, V-, and Y-shaped fatty acid-conjugated siRNAs which were characterized by native PAGE. CD spectroscopy confirmed their A-type helix conformations. RP IP HPLC provided trends in amphiphilic properties, whereas DLS and TEM confirmed multicomponent self-assembled structures that were prone to aggregation. Subsequently, the fatty acid conjugated siRNA bioconjugates were tested for their RNAi activity by direct transfection within PC-3 cells known to overexpress oncogenic GRP activity. The siRNA bioconjugates with sense strand modifiers provided more potent GRP knockdown relative to the antisense modified siRNAs, but to a lesser extent when compared to the unconjugated siRNA controls that were transfected with the commercial Trans-IT X2 dynamic delivery system. Flow cytometry revealed that the latter may be at least in part attributed to limited cell uptake of the fatty acid conjugated siRNAs. Nonetheless, these new constructs represent an entry point in modifying higher-order siRNA constructs that may lead to the generation of more efficient siRNA bioconjugates for screening important oncogene targets and for cancer gene therapy applications.""","""['Sunil S Shah', 'Christopher N Cultrara', 'Stephen D Kozuch', 'Mayurbhai R Patel', 'Jorge A Ramos', 'Uri Samuni', 'Jenny Zilberberg', 'David Sabatino']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['RNAi Screening of the Glucose-Regulated Chaperones in Cancer with Self-Assembled siRNA Nanostructures.', 'Solid phase synthesis and self-assembly of higher-order siRNAs and their bioconjugates.', 'Palmitic acid-conjugated 21-nucleotide siRNA enhances gene-silencing activity.', 'Polyethylenimines for RNAi-mediated gene targeting in vivo and siRNA delivery to the lung.', 'Advances in Targeting Cancer-Associated Genes by Designed siRNA in Prostate Cancer.', 'Size Matters: Arginine-Derived Peptides Targeting the PSMA Receptor Can Efficiently Complex but Not Transfect siRNA.', 'Present Scenario of Bioconjugates in Cancer Therapy: A Review.']"""

We compared the detection rates for any cancer, clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCA), and the spatial distribution of missed csPCA lesions.Among the 219 cases, 66 (30.1%) had a PI-RADS score of 1 to 2 on mpMRI. The detection rate of TTPSB in these patients was 9.1% (6/66). In total, detection rates for any cancer and csPCA were 48.9% (107/219) and 42.9% (94/219), respectively. Detection rates for any cancer (TTPSB 87/219, 39.7%; MR-GPB76/219, 34.7%, P = .161) and csPCA (TTPSB 76/219, 34.7%; MR-GPB 72/219, 32.9%, P = .636) did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. The csPCA lesions missed by MR-GPB were most commonly located on the left (8.5%, 8/94) and right (9.6%, 9/94) sides of the urethra.MR-GPB can reduce the rate of unnecessary prostate biopsies by approximately 30% and exhibits an efficacy comparable to TTPSB for the detection of any cancer and csPCA.

Patient characteristics and pathological parameters were assessed. We summarized patients using descriptive analyses and evaluated guideline-adherence within selected subgroups. We created a multivariable model to identify predictors of guideline-adherence.  Results:   Median age was 75 years (range 39-94 years), multifocal tumors were found in 44.1%, early instillation was performed in 33.3%, and repeat resection was performed in 77.5%.

Even well-functioning implants produce wear debris that can cause tissue damage, disseminate and cause DNA damage. We aimed to establish if there was an association between metal-on-metal hip replacement and the risk of subsequently developing cancer compared with alternative hip replacements.  Methods:   We performed a population based prospective longitudinal cohort study using data from the National Joint Registry linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (n = 403,881 patients). We examined the incidence of a new diagnosis of cancer in patients who received a metal-on-metal bearing in comparison with those who received a non metal-on-metal bearing. Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first cancer diagnosis were used with Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess the effect on the time to cancer diagnosis for all cancer types, haematological, malignant melanoma, urinary tract cancers or prostate cancer in men.  Results:   The maximum follow up available was 11.8 years with 25% of patients followed up for more than 6.8 years (mean follow up 4.6 years; median 4.3; IQR 2.1-6.8; range 0.01-11.8).

For patients receiving a second hip replacement, there was also no difference.  Conclusion:   We have demonstrated that there is currently no evidence of an increase in the risk of cancer following primary hip replacement according to the type of bearing material used. Although the risk of revision in metal-on-metal bearing hip replacements is higher, it is reassuring that the risk of a new diagnosis of cancer is not currently increased.

Hybrid heterostructure materials combining two or more materials in one structure represent a powerful way to achieve unique properties and multifunctionality compared to those of the individual nanoparticle components. Hybrid gold nanorods and gold nanoclusters (GNR/AuNCs) heterostructures prepared by intimate integration of GNRs with AuNCs exhibit both localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property and peroxidase-like activity. It is found that the catalytic activity of the AuNC/GNR heterostructure could be remarkably enhanced by LSPR induced by photon-plasmon coupling in the visible to near-infrared (NIR) region. Meanwhile, the catalytic activity of enzyme-like AuNC/GNRs may be regulated by immunoreactions to realize specific recognition of a target analyte. Accordingly, a fast colorimetric assay within 5 min for the detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) was developed based on a AuNC/GNRs heterostructure mask regulated by the target molecule under photon-plasmon coupling. The color intensity is inversely proportional to the PSA concentration, and quantitative analysis may be achieved in a range of 10 and 200 pg mL-1. This sensor was practically applied to detect PSA levels in prostate cancer serum samples and the determined values agreed well with those measured by the hospital using standard methods. This indicates that the AuNC/GNRs heterostructure-based assay has high accuracy for the analysis of practical samples. Moreover, the new method has the advantages of very fast determination and low sample volume requirements.""","""['Fang Tan', 'Yan Yang', 'Xiaoxue Xie', 'Linqian Wang', 'Keqin Deng', 'Xiaodong Xia', 'Xiumei Yang', 'Haowen Huang']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['Enhanced Mimetic Enzyme Activity of Phosphorylated Porphyrin Nanocomposite Induced by Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance for Colorimetric Assay.', 'Facile preparation of peroxidase-like core-shell nanorods and application as platform for colorimetric determination of glucose, insulin and glucose/insulin ratio.', 'Plasmon-activated nanozymes with enhanced catalytic activity by near-infrared light irradiation.', 'Near-infrared-emitting NaYF4:Yb,Tm/Mn upconverting nanoparticle/gold nanorod electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer system for sensitive prostate-specific antigen detection.', 'Polyelectrolyte-coated gold nanorods and their biomedical applications.', 'The Recent Development of Multifunctional Gold Nanoclusters in Tumor Theranostic and Combination Therapy.', 'Recent progress in the optical detection of pathogenic bacteria based on noble metal nanoparticles.']"""

Methods:   Seventeen patients with advanced prostate cancer were selected for treatment with 225Ac-PSMA-617 in 2-month intervals, with initial activity of 8 MBq, then de-escalation to 7 MBq, 6 MBq or 4 MBq in cases of good response. In one patient, activity was escalated to 13 MBq in the third cycle. Fourteen patients had three treatment cycles administered, while in three patients treatment was discontinued after two cycles due to good response. Six out of 17 patients received additional treatments after the third cycle. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured every 4 weeks for PSA response assessment. 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT was used for functional response assessment before each subsequent treatment cycle. Serial full blood count, renal function test, and liver function were obtained to determine treatment-related side effects.  Results:   Good antitumor activity assessed by serum PSA level and 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT was seen in 16/17 patients.

One of the main mechanisms for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to induce T cell tolerance is through secretion of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which nitrates tyrosine residues in proteins involved in T cell function. However, so far very few nitrated proteins have been identified. Here, using a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer and a syngeneic cell line model of lung cancer, we applied a nitroproteomic approach based on chemical derivation of 3-nitrotyrosine and identified that lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), an initiating tyrosine kinase in the T cell receptor signaling cascade, is nitrated at Tyr394 by MDSCs. LCK nitration inhibits T cell activation, leading to reduced interleukin 2 (IL2) production and proliferation. In human T cells with defective endogenous LCK, wild type, but not nitrated LCK, rescues IL2 production. In the mouse model of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by prostate-specific deletion of Pten, p53, and Smad4, CRPC is resistant to an ICB therapy composed of antiprogrammed cell death 1 (PD1) and anticytotoxic-T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) antibodies. However, we showed that ICB elicits strong anti-CRPC efficacy when combined with an RNS neutralizing agent. Together, these data identify a previously unknown mechanism of T cell inactivation by MDSC-induced protein nitration and illuminate a clinical path hypothesis for combining ICB with RNS-reducing agents in the treatment of CRPC.""","""['Shan Feng', 'Xi Cheng', 'Lin Zhang', 'Xuemin Lu', 'Seema Chaudhary', 'Ruifang Teng', 'Christian Frederickson', 'Matthew M Champion', 'Ren Zhao', 'Liang Cheng', 'Yiyi Gong', 'Haiteng Deng', 'Xin Lu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Effective combinatorial immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Differential Targeting of Gr-MDSCs, T Cells and Prostate Cancer Cells by Dactolisib and Dasatinib.', 'The kinase Itk and the adaptor TSAd change the specificity of the kinase Lck in T cells by promoting the phosphorylation of Tyr192.', 'T cell receptor signalling networks: branched, diversified and bounded.', 'The Emerging Role of CD244 Signaling in Immune Cells of the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'New insights and options into the mechanisms and effects of combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Fluorescent Detection of Peroxynitrite Produced by Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in Cancer and Inhibition by Dasatinib.', 'A Nanovaccine Based on Adjuvant Peptide FK-13 and l-Phenylalanine Poly(ester amide) Enhances CD8+ T Cell-Mediated Antitumor Immunity.', 'POLD1 as a Prognostic Biomarker Correlated with Cell Proliferation and Immune Infiltration in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'The tumor ecosystem in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and advances in ecotherapy.']"""

N-myc is capable of driving NEPC progression. Alisertib inhibits the interaction between N-myc and its stabilizing factor Aurora-A, inhibiting N-myc signaling, and suppressing tumor growth.  Patients and methods:   Sixty men were treated with alisertib 50 mg twice daily for 7 days every 21 days. Eligibility included metastatic prostate cancer and at least one: small-cell neuroendocrine morphology; ≥50% neuroendocrine marker expression; new liver metastases without PSA progression; or elevated serum neuroendocrine markers. The primary endpoint was 6-month radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Pretreatment biopsies were evaluated by whole exome and RNA-seq and patient-derived organoids were developed.  Results:   Median PSA was 1.13 ng/mL (0.01-514.2), number of prior therapies was 3, and 68% had visceral metastases. Genomic alterations involved RB1 (55%), TP53 (46%), PTEN (29%), BRCA2 (29%), and AR (27%), and there was a range of androgen receptor signaling and NEPC marker expression. Six-month rPFS was 13.4% and median overall survival was 9.5 months (7.3-13). Exceptional responders were identified, including complete resolution of liver metastases and prolonged stable disease, with tumors suggestive of N-myc and Aurora-A overactivity. Patient organoids exhibited concordant responses to alisertib and allowed for the dynamic testing of Aurora-N-myc complex disruption.

Although a variety of web tools are now available to extract information from OMICs data, their utility has been limited by the capacity of nonbioinformatician researchers to exploit the information. To address this problem, we have developed CANCERTOOL, a web-based interface that aims to overcome the major limitations of public transcriptomics dataset analysis for highly prevalent types of cancer (breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal). CANCERTOOL provides rapid and comprehensive visualization of gene expression data for the gene(s) of interest in well-annotated cancer datasets. This visualization is accompanied by generation of reports customized to the interest of the researcher (e.g., editable figures, detailed statistical analyses, and access to raw data for reanalysis). It also carries out gene-to-gene correlations in multiple datasets at the same time or using preset patient groups. Finally, this new tool solves the time-consuming task of performing functional enrichment analysis with gene sets of interest using up to 11 different databases at the same time. Collectively, CANCERTOOL represents a simple and freely accessible interface to interrogate well-annotated datasets and obtain publishable representations that can contribute to refinement and guidance of cancer-related investigations at all levels of hypotheses and design.Significance: In order to facilitate access of research groups without bioinformatics support to public transcriptomics data, we have developed a free online tool with an easy-to-use interface that allows researchers to obtain quality information in a readily publishable format.

Knowledge of the general urinary EAAS profile's dependence from aging - not reported up to now - may represents a prerequisite for its exploitation in the screening and diagnostic support for several pathologies. Extended urinary EAAS profiles were obtained from healthy and pathological individuals, using a GC-MS method which was fully validated by a stepwise, analyst-independent scheme. Seventeen EAAS and five of their concentration ratios were determined and investigated using multivariate statistical methods. A regression model based on Kernel partial least squares algorithm was built to correlate the chronological age of healthy male individuals with their ""physiological age"" as determined from their urinary EAAS profile. Strong correlation (R2 = 0.75; slope = 0.747) and good prediction ability of the real chronological age was inferred from EAAS data. In contrast, patients with recent diagnosis (not pharmacologically treated) of prostatic carcinoma (PCa) exhibited a comprehensive EAAS profile with strong negative deviation from the model, corresponding a younger predicted age. This result is possibly related to the activation of anomalous steroid biosynthesis induced from PCa. Over a restricted 60-80 years-old population, PLS-discriminant analysis (DA) was used to distinguish healthy subjects from patients with untreated PCa. PLS-DA yielded excellent discrimination (sensitivity and specificity >90%) between healthy and pathological individuals.

The adult stem cell signature selected for epithelial cancers with worse overall survival and alterations of oncogenic drivers. Lethal small cell neuroendocrine lung, prostate, and bladder cancers transcriptionally converged onto the adult stem cell signature and not other stem cell signatures tested. We found that DNA methyltransferase expression correlated with adult stem cell signature status and was enriched in small cell neuroendocrine cancers.

A special focus has been placed to evaluate the vascular heterogeneity of the tumor and on the most suitable data analysis approach that reflects this heterogeneity.  Material and methods:   In vivo DCE-US was acquired 24 h and 48 h after radiation treatment with a single dose of 7.5 Gy and 10 Gy, respectively.

We aimed to investigate whether PCa is related with NAFLD in Korean adults.  Methods:   Data from the National Health Insurance Corporation between 2009 and 2012 were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression method. NALFD was defined based on the fatty liver index (FLI) and hepatic steatosis index (HSI). Newly diagnosed PCa was identified using the claims data.  Results:   NAFLD based on FLI and HSI was identified in 2,002,375 (19%) and 2,629,858 (25%) of 10,516,985 subjects, respectively. Each FLI ≥ 60 and HSI ≥ 36 was independently associated with the development of PCa after adjusting for other confounders (hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.12 and HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.16-1.23). The association was more prominent among those who were older (FLI, ≥ 65 years old and HSI, ≥ 40 years old), were not currently smoking, were presently consuming alcohol (< 30g/day) and had null components of metabolic syndrome than each counterpart. Non-obese persons with NAFLD defined by HSI had a higher risk of developing PCa than those with body mass index > 25 Kg/m2.

The goal of this work was to develop and test analysis methods for improved quantification of this metabolic conversion. In this work, we compared specialized kinetic modeling methods to estimate the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion rate, kPL , as well as the lactate-to-pyruvate area-under-curve (AUC) ratio. The kinetic modeling included an ""inputless"" method requiring no assumptions regarding the input function, as well as a method incorporating bolus characteristics in the fitting. These were first evaluated with simulated data designed to match human prostate data, where we examined the expected sensitivity of metabolism quantification to variations in kPL , signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), bolus characteristics, relaxation rates, and B1 variability. They were then applied to 17 prostate cancer patient datasets. The simulations indicated that the inputless method with fixed relaxation rates provided high expected accuracy with no sensitivity to bolus characteristics. The AUC ratio showed an undesired strong sensitivity to bolus variations. Fitting the input function as well did not improve accuracy over the inputless method. In vivo results showed qualitatively accurate kPL maps with inputless fitting. The AUC ratio was sensitive to bolus delivery variations. Fitting with the input function showed high variability in parameter maps.

Further investigation of the involvement of AR signaling in PCa progression is urgently needed. In the present study, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and demonstrated that SERTA domain-containing protein 1 (Sertad1) is a novel AR-binding protein that binds to the AR ligand binding domain (LBD). The binding between AR-LBD and Sertad1 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation (IP) and confocal immunofluorescence co-localization experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DHT inhibited Sertad1 protein degradation in prostate cancer cell lines and that Sertad1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In human PCa tumor tissues, Sertad1 expression is positively correlated with AR expression and the Gleason score. Taken together, this report is the first to show that Sertad1 is a novel AR-LBD-binding protein, and DHT-liganded AR-LBD inhibits Sertad1 degradation. Thus, Sertad1 may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AR-positive PCa.""","""['Bingqing Hu', 'Haidi Hu', 'Mingzhu Yin', 'Zhengrong Sun', 'Xiaoya Chen', 'Ying Li', 'Ziyi Sun', 'Cong Liu', 'Ling Li', 'Yang Qiu']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Inhibition of androgen receptor transactivation function by adenovirus type 12 E1A undermines prostate cancer cell survival.', 'Determinants of Gli2 co-activation of wildtype and naturally truncated androgen receptors.', 'Flightless I Homolog Represses Prostate Cancer Progression through Targeting Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'Identification and characterization of androgen receptor associated coregulators in prostate cancer cells.', 'Functional analysis of androgen receptor N-terminal and ligand binding domain interacting coregulators in prostate cancer.', 'Analyzing the Androgen Receptor Interactome in Prostate Cancer: Implications for Therapeutic Intervention.', 'Sertad1 Induces Neurological Injury after Ischemic Stroke via the CDK4/p-Rb Pathway.', 'RNA-binding protein Musashi2 stabilizing androgen receptor drives prostate cancer progression.']"""

Methods:   From 2008 to 2016, we prospectively enrolled a consecutive series of men with no history of PCa undergoing prostate biopsies. Variables assessed the day of the biopsy included: Family history of PCa, age, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate volume, PSA, free PSA, smoking status, number of cigarette/day, smoking time, smoking starting age and smoking cessation. Smoking variables were evaluated as predictors of PCa and high grade PCa (Prognostic Grade Group ≥3) using adjusted logistic regression analyses.  Results:   Overall 1080 patients were enrolled, out of them 499/1080/753 (46%) had never smoked; 168/1080/753 (16%) were smokers and 413/1080 (38%) were former smokers.

As expected family history, age, dyslipidemia, PSA, digital rectal examination and prostate volume were independent predictors of PCa. As well age, DRE, and PSA were independent predictors of high-grade disease. Smoking status (OR=0.983; CI: 0.689-1.402) and the associated variables were not independent predictors of PCa or high grade PCa (OR: 1.250; CI: 0.593-1.327).

Purpose:   To develop and validate a radiomics-based model for differentiating PCa and assessing its aggressiveness compared with PI-RADS v2 scores.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   In all, 182 patients with biopsy-proven PCa and 199 patients with a biopsy-proven absence of cancer were enrolled in our study.  Field strength/sequence:   Conventional and diffusion-weighted MR images (b values = 0, 1000 sec/mm2 ) were acquired on a 3.0T MR scanner.  Assessment:   A total of 396 features and 385 features were extracted from apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images and T2 WI, respectively. A predictive model was constructed for differentiating PCa from non-PCa and high-grade from low-grade PCa. The diagnostic performance of each radiomics-based model was compared with that of the PI-RADS v2 scores.  Statistical tests:   A radiomics-based predictive model was constructed by logistic regression analysis. 70% of the patients were assigned to the training group, and the remaining were assigned to the validation group. The diagnostic efficacy was analyzed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in both the training and validation groups.  Results:   For PCa versus non-PCa, the validation model had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.985, 0.982, and 0.999 with T2 WI, ADC, and T2 WI&ADC features, respectively. For low-grade versus high-grade PCa, the validation model had an AUC of 0.865, 0.888, and 0.93 with T2 WI, ADC, and T2 WI&ADC features, respectively. PI-RADS v2 had an AUC of 0.867 in differentiating PCa from non-PCa and an AUC of 0.763 in differentiating high-grade from low-grade PCa.  Data conclusion:   Both the T2 WI- and ADC-based radiomics models showed high diagnostic efficacy and outperformed the PI-RADS v2 scores in distinguishing cancerous vs. noncancerous prostate tissue and high-grade vs. low-grade PCa.

This makes researching, implementing and testing features time-consuming and cost-intensive. In our work, we aim to address this issue by creating ImFEATbox, a publicly available toolbox to extract and analyze image features for a wide range of applications.  Methods:   To reduce the amount of time spent for choosing the right features, we provide an assortment of feature extraction algorithms which are suitable for a broad variety of medical image processing problems. The toolbox includes both global and local features as well as feature descriptors. While being primarily developed in MATLAB, the majority of our algorithms is also available in Python to enable access to a wider range of researchers.  Results:   We tested the applicability of ImFEATbox on an FDG-PET/CT data set of 12 patients diagnosed with lung cancer and an MRI data set of 50 patients with prostate lesions. Employing the implemented algorithms in an exemplary manner, we are able to demonstrate its potential for different scientific problems, e.g., show differences between features, indicate redundancies in extracted feature sets by means of a correlation analysis and training a SVM to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk prostate lesions.  Conclusion:   ImFEATbox provides a variety of feature extraction algorithms suitable for a large number of post-processing and analysis applications in medical imaging. The toolbox is publicly available and can thus be beneficial to a wide range of researchers working on medical image analysis.""","""['Annika Liebgott', 'Thomas Küstner', 'Heiko Strohmeier', 'Tobias Hepp', 'Philipp Mangold', 'Petros Martirosian', 'Fabian Bamberg', 'Konstantin Nikolaou', 'Bin Yang', 'Sergios Gatidis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Software Toolbox for Low-Frequency Conductivity and Current Density Imaging Using MRI.', 'Sensitivity of Image Features to Noise in Conventional and Respiratory-Gated PET/CT Images of Lung Cancer: Uncorrelated Noise Effects.', 'A Dirichlet process mixture model for automatic (18)F-FDG PET image segmentation: Validation study on phantoms and on lung and esophageal lesions.', 'A Cross Sectional Study of Tumors Using Bio-Medical Imaging Modalities.', 'Advances in computers and image processing with applications in nuclear medicine.', 'Robustness of radiomic features in magnetic resonance imaging: review and a phantom study.']"""

Using prostate cancer cell lines, we showed that INPP4B regulates AR transcriptional activity and the oncogenic signaling pathways Akt and PKC. Analysis of gene expression in prostate cancer patient cohorts showed a positive correlation between INPP4B expression and both AR mRNA levels and AR transcriptional output. Using an Inpp4b-/- mouse model, we demonstrated that INPP4B suppresses Akt and PKC signaling pathways and modulates AR transcriptional activity in normal mouse prostate.

Enzymes inactivating potent androgens were not investigated thoroughly, which leads to limited interference strategies for prostate cancer therapy. Here we characterized the clinical relevance, significance, and regulation mechanism of enzyme HSD17B2 in prostate cancer development.  Experimental design: HSD17B2 expression was detected with patient specimens and prostate cancer cell lines. Function of HSD17B2 in steroidogenesis, androgen receptor (AR) signaling, and tumor growth was investigated with prostate cancer cell lines and a xenograft model. DNA methylation and mRNA alternative splicing were investigated to unveil the mechanisms of HSD17B2 regulation.  Results: HSD17B2 expression was reduced as prostate cancer progressed. 17βHSD2 decreased potent androgen production by converting testosterone (T) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to each of their upstream precursors. HSD17B2 overexpression suppressed androgen-induced cell proliferation and xenograft growth. Multiple mechanisms were involved in HSD17B2 functional silencing including DNA methylation and mRNA alternative splicing. DNA methylation decreased the HSD17B2 mRNA level. Two new catalytic-deficient isoforms, generated by alternative splicing, bound to wild-type 17βHSD2 and promoted its degradation. Splicing factors SRSF1 and SRSF5 participated in the generation of new isoforms.  Conclusions:   Our findings provide evidence of the clinical relevance, significance, and regulation of HSD17B2 in prostate cancer progression, which might provide new strategies for clinical management by targeting the functional silencing mechanisms of HSD17B2.See related commentary by Mostaghel, p. 1139.""","""['Xiaomei Gao#', 'Charles Dai#', 'Shengsong Huang#', 'Jingjie Tang#', 'Guoyuan Chen', 'Jianneng Li', 'Ziqi Zhu', 'Xuyou Zhu', 'Shuirong Zhou', 'Yuanyuan Gao', 'Zemin Hou', 'Zijun Fang', 'Chengdang Xu', 'Jianyang Wang', 'Denglong Wu', 'Nima Sharifi', 'Zhenfei Li']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Alternative Acts: Oncogenic Splicing of Steroidogenic Enzymes in Prostate Cancer.', 'Alternative Acts: Oncogenic Splicing of Steroidogenic Enzymes in Prostate Cancer.', 'Steroidogenic enzymes and stem cell markers are upregulated during androgen deprivation in prostate cancer.', '5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol supports human prostate cancer cell survival and proliferation through androgen receptor-independent signaling pathways: implication of androgen-independent prostate cancer progression.', 'Alternative splicing in prostate cancer.', ""Long noncoding RNAs and prostate carcinogenesis: the missing 'linc'?"", 'Abnormal DNA methylation within genes of the steroidogenesis pathway two years after paediatric critical illness and association with stunted growth in height further in time.', 'The role of 11-oxygenated androgens in prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of high risk factors for chronic atrophic gastritis.', 'CPEB2 m6A methylation regulates blood-tumor barrier permeability by regulating splicing factor SRSF5 stability.', 'Identification of Metabolism-Related Gene-Based Subgroup in Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, AR antagonists in clinical use, such as flutamide (3a) and bicalutamide (4), encounter resistance after several years of hormone therapy, predominantly due to mutations of AR. Thus, although some new-generation AR antagonists have been developed, novel types of AR antagonists are still required to treat drug-resistant prostate cancer. We previously reported a novel (benzoylaminophenoxy)phenol derivative 10a, which is structurally distinct from conventional AR antagonists. Here, we systematically examined the structure-activity relationship of (benzoylaminophenoxy)phenol derivatives on the inhibitory activity on the prostate cancer cell proliferations. We found that the 4-[4-(benzoylamino)phenoxy]phenol backbone is important for anti-prostate cancer activity. Introduction of a small substituent at the 2 position of the central benzene ring (B ring) increases the activity. Among the synthesized compounds, 19a and 19b exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity toward dihydrotestosterone-induced proliferation of several androgen-dependent cell lines, SC-3 (wild-type AR), LNCaP (T877A AR), and 22Rv1 (H874Y AR), but interestingly also inhibited proliferation of AR-independent PC-3 cells.

However, limited prospective evidence is available.  Objective:   To determine the safety and feasibility of single fraction SABR for patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer. Secondary endpoints were local and distant progression-free survival (LPFS and DPFS), toxicity, quality of life (QoL), and prostate-specific antigen response.  Design, setting, and participants:   In a prospective clinical trial, patients were screened with computed tomography, bone scan, and sodium fluoride positron emission tomography scan and had one to three oligometastases. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to determine LPFS and DPFS. Toxicity was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version 4.0. QoL was assessed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BM22 at 1, 3,12, and 24 mo.  Intervention:   A single fraction of 20-Gy SABR to each lesion.  Results and limitations:   Between 2013 and 2014, 33 consecutive patients received SABR to a total of 50 oligometastases and were followed for 2 yr. The median age was 70 yr. The Gleason score was ≥8 in 15 patients (45%). Twenty patients had bone only, 12 had node only, and one had mixed disease. SABR was feasible and delivered as planned in 97% of cases. There was one grade 3 adverse event (3.0%, vertebral fracture). No patient died. The 1 and 2-yr LPFS was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 91-100) and 93% (95% CI: 84-100), and DPFS was 58% (95% CI: 43-77) and 39% (95% CI: 25-60), respectively. In those not on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; n=22), the 2-yr freedom from ADT was 48%. There was no significant difference from baseline QoL observed. Limitations include small sample size, limited duration of follow-up, and lack of a control arm.  Conclusions:   A single SABR session was feasible and associated with low morbidity in this cohort. Over one-third of patients did not progress and were free from ADT at 2-yr. QoL measures were maintained with this treatment strategy.

Bakuchiol significantly suppressed PC-3 cell proliferation and migration; the expressions of PCNA and MMP-9 were consistently down regulated as well. Meanwhile, both the constitutive and LPS-induced NF-κB activation were significantly inhibited by bakuchiol. The inhibitory effects of bakuchiol on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were recovered when LPS were added together with bakuchiol. SiRNA against androgen receptor (AR) or estrogen receptor β (ERβ) were transfected and the regulation of bakuchiol-suppressed proliferation, invasion, NF-κB signaling and MMP-9 secretion in response to LPS were blocked. Taken together, our data demonstrated that bakuchiol inactivated NF-κB signaling via AR and ERβ, which contributes to inhibition of PC-3 cell proliferation and migration, indicating that bakuchiol is one of the key component from P. corylifolia L for PCa treatment and has a potential as anti-prostate cancer drug candidates.""","""['Lin Miao', 'Xiaoting Yun', 'Rui Tao', 'Yuefei Wang', 'Guanwei Fan', 'Yan Zhu', 'Ting Cai', 'Zhipeng Zhu', 'Chunlin Yan', 'Xiumei Gao']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Sci""","""['Bakuchiol suppresses oestrogen/testosterone-induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia development through up-regulation of epithelial estrogen receptor β and down-regulation of stromal aromatase.', ""Down-regulation of androgen receptor by 3,3'-diindolylmethane contributes to inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in both hormone-sensitive LNCaP and insensitive C4-2B prostate cancer cells."", 'Effect of compound Chinese traditional medicine PC-SPES II in inhibiting proliferation of human prostate cancer cell LNCaP and on expressions of AR and PSA.', 'NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer: a promising therapeutic target?', 'Mechanism of Anti-Cancer Activity of Curcumin on Androgen-Dependent and Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer.', 'Signal Crosstalk and the Role of Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ) in Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Basis of Prostate Cancer and Natural Products as Potential Chemotherapeutic and Chemopreventive Agents.', 'Induction of G2/M Cell Cycle Arrest via p38/p21Waf1/Cip1-Dependent Signaling Pathway Activation by Bavachinin in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells.']"""

However, most chemotherapy with docetaxel eventually fails with the development of docetaxel resistance after 18-weeks of treatment. Here we found docetaxel treatment might have an adverse effect of increasing the androgen receptor (AR) protein level in the CRPC cells, and combining docetaxel with anti-AR therapy using AR-shRNA or the AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9® may increase docetaxel sensitivity to better suppress the CRPC cell growth. Mechanism dissection found docetaxel might have the adverse effect of increasing the AR protein stability via suppressing the AR ubiquitination due to the increased AR phosphorylation. The consequence of such increased AR protein may then lead to increase p21 expression via transcriptional regulation. Preclinical studies with in vitro cells lines also demonstrated that targeting AR with ASC-J9® led to suppressing the AR-increased p21 expression to improve the docetaxel sensitivity in the CRPC cells that already developed docetaxel resistance.

The objectives of this study were to assess the feasibility of radical prostatectomy after vascular targeted photodynamic therapy and describe functional and oncologic outcomes.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively included in study 45 patients who underwent salvage radical prostatectomy after vascular targeted photodynamic therapy for recurrent prostate cancer at a total of 14 surgical centers in Europe between October 2008 and March 2017. Of the 42 radical prostatectomies performed 16 were robot-assisted, 6 were laparoscopic and 20 were open surgery. Primary end points were morbidity and technical difficulties. Secondary end points were early and intermediate postoperative functional and oncologic outcomes.  Results:   Median operative time was 180 minutes (IQR 150-223). Median blood loss was 200 ml (IQR 155-363). According to the surgeons the surgery was easy in 29 patients (69%) and difficult in 13 (31%). Nerve sparing was feasible in 14 patients (33%). Five postoperative complications (12%) were found, including 2 Clavien I, 2 Clavien II and 1 Clavien IIIB complications. Of the cases 13 (31%) were pT3 and 21 (50%) were pT2c. Surgical margins were positive in 13 patients (31%). Prostate specific antigen was undetectable at 6 to 12 months in 37 patients (88%). Nine patients underwent complementary radiotherapy. Four patients had final prostate specific antigen greater than 0.2 ng/ml at a median followup of 23 months (IQR 12-36). At 1 year 27 patients (64%) were completely continent (no pads) and 10 (24%) had low incontinence (1 pad).

Patients and methods:   Consecutive patients who underwent RP for localised prostate cancer between 2003 and 2017 were identified from a prospectively recorded, dedicated prostate cancer database. Patients who received neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy were excluded. These patients were categorised into the following groups: no BCR, BCR at <12 months (early), BCR at 12-60 months (intermediate), and BCR at >60 months (late), after RP. Clinicopathological characteristics were analysed using the Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, or chi-squared test where appropriate. Multivariable binomial logistic regression models were used to assess predictors of BCR at various time-points.  Results:   In all, 2312 patients were included in the final analysis with up to 12 years of follow-up data. The average patient had clinically localised prostate cancer, an elevated PSA level, and International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group 2 on biopsy. In all, 88.7% of patients had ISUP Grade Group ≥2 at RP. A subgroup of 446 patients had undetectable PSA levels at 5 years after RP; 11.7% of them progressed to experience BCR. In this subgroup, late recurrers had significantly higher-grade tumours on ISUP and Gleason sum (P <0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively), higher rates of extraprostatic extension (P = 0.022), and larger tumour volumes (P = 0.032). Logistic regression showed that RP ISUP Grade Group was a significant predictor of BCR (odds ratio 2.14, 95% confidence interval 1.43-3.20; P <0.001).  Conclusion:   This study characterises the pattern of late BCR in the largest contemporary active surveillance era cohort. We have identified that RP ISUP Grade Group is a strong predictive indicator for late BCR.

Last, we examined if confirmatory test results were associated with upgrading or adverse pathology at RP.  Results:   Amongst 1966 patients with GG1 cancer at diagnosis, the rates of upgrading to ≥GG2 and adverse pathology were 40% and 59% (P < 0.001), and 10% and 17% (P = 0.003) for patients with very-low- and low-risk cancers, respectively.

To decipher this puzzle, we investigated the upstream signaling pathway that might be involved in promoting ribosomal stress that leads to tumor progression. Our results suggested that inhibition of kinase PIM1 attenuated PC3 cell growth and motility following the condensed cellular body and decreased protein translation in PIM1-inhibited cells. In addition, PIM1 was found to be a component of the small 40S ribosomal subunit and could regulate the expression of ribosomal small subunit protein 7 (RPS7). Our investigation also revealed that PIM1 enhanced the protein stability of c-Myc. Furthermore, a functional E-box motif was found upstream of the transcription start site in RPS7, and RPS7 has been proven to be a transcriptional target of c-Myc. Additionally, knocking down RPS7 dramatically reduced cell growth in vitro and in vivo, whereas enhancing RPS7 expression reversed the condensed cellular body and decreased protein translation resulted from PIM1 inhibition. Finally, biochemical recurrence-free survival and overall survival analysis indicated that the concomitant upregulation of PIM1 and RPS7 correlated with the worst prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa).

Overuse of imaging is well documented in the setting of newly diagnosed prostate cancer, but whether overuse persists after RP remains unknown.  Patients and methods:   We identified 12 269 patients with prostate cancer treated with RP between 2005 and 2008 using the Veterans Administration Central Cancer Registry. We used administrative and laboratory data to examine rates of bone scan use, including preceding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and receipt of adjuvant or salvage therapy. We then performed multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with post-RP bone scan use.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 6.8 years, one in five men (22%) underwent a post-RP bone scan at a median PSA level of 0.2 ng/mL. Half of bone scans (48%) were obtained in men who did not receive further treatment with androgen-deprivation or radiation therapy. After adjustment, post-RP bone scan was associated with a prior bone scan (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.84), positive surgical margin (aOR 1.68, 95% CI 1.40-2.01), preoperative PSA level (aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), as well as Hispanic ethnicity, Black race, and increasing D'Amico risk category, but not with age or comorbidity.  Conclusion:   We found a substantial rate of bone scan utilisation after RP. The majority were performed for PSA levels of <1 ng/mL where the likelihood of a positive test is low.

Patients and methods:   Patients with prostate cancer (clinical stages cT1-3, cN0, cM0) undergoing RARP at our Centre, from June 2017 to April 2018, were enrolled. In all cases, cancer was diagnosed with targeted biopsy at the level of index lesion based on high-resolution (1-mm slices) mpMRI. HA3D reconstruction was created by dedicated software to obtain the 3D virtual model of the prostate and surrounding structures. A specific system was used to overlay virtual data on the endoscopic video displayed by the remote da Vinci® surgical console (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and the virtual images were superimposed by the surgeon by the means of the TilePro™ multi-input display technology (Intuitive Surgical Inc.). The AR technology was used in four standardised key steps during RARP. The procedures were modulated differently in cases of prostate cancer without extracapsular extension (ECE) at mpMRI (Group A) or in cases of prostate cancer with ECE (Group B) at mpMRI. In Group A, the virtual image of the prostate was overlaid on the endoscopic view and the intraprostatic lesion was marked on the prostate surface by a metallic clip at the level of the suspicious lesion as identified by the 3D virtual AR image. In Group B, the same step was performed; moreover, a metallic clip was placed at the level of the suspicious ECE on the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) according to the virtual images. Finally, selective biopsies were taken from the NVBs at this level, and then, the entire NVBs were removed for final pathological examination, according to standard clinical indications. For Group A, the pathologist performed a targeted needle biopsy at the level of the metallic clip on the surface of prostate before the sample reduction. For Group B, the presence of tumour was evaluated during the reduction phase, at the level of metallic clip on the prostate surface and at the level of NVBs, sent separately. Finally, an image 3D scanner (Kinect, Microsoft) was used to perform a dimensional comparison between the mpMRI-based 3D virtual reconstruction and the whole-mount specimen.  Results:   In all, 30 patients were enrolled in the present study, 11 (36.6%) included in Group A and 19 (63.4%) in Group B. In all cases (30/30), final pathology confirmed the location of the index lesion, as cancer was found at the level of the metallic clip. The suspected ECE was confirmed on final pathology in 15/19 cases (79%). The AR-guided selective biopsies at the level of the NVBs confirmed the ECE location, with 11/15 (73.3%) biopsies at the level of NVBs positive for cancer. The mismatch between the 3D virtual reconstruction and the prostate 3D scanning based on the whole-mount specimen was <3 mm in >85% of the gland.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that a HA3D virtual reconstruction of the prostate based on mpMRI data and real-time superimposed imaging allow performance of an effective AR-RARP. Potentially, this approach translates into better outcomes, as the surgeon can tailor the procedure for each patient.""","""['Francesco Porpiglia', 'Enrico Checcucci', 'Daniele Amparore', 'Riccardo Autorino', 'Alberto Piana', 'Andrea Bellin', 'Pietro Piazzolla', 'Federica Massa', 'Enrico Bollito', 'Dario Gned', 'Agostino De Pascale', 'Cristian Fiori']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Augmented Reality Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Preliminary Experience.', 'Three-dimensional Elastic Augmented-reality Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Using Hyperaccuracy Three-dimensional Reconstruction Technology: A Step Further in the Identification of Capsular Involvement.', 'Real-time Augmented Reality Three-dimensional Guided Robotic Radical Prostatectomy: Preliminary Experience and Evaluation of the Impact on Surgical Planning.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Methods for training of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Effect of augmented reality navigation technology on perioperative safety in partial nephrectomies: A meta-analysis and systematic review.', 'Prostate MRI for Improving Personalized Risk Prediction of Incontinence and Surgical Planning: The Role of Membranous Urethral Length Measurements and the Use of 3D Models.', 'Impact of 3D\xa0printed models on quantitative surgical outcomes for patients undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a cohort study.', 'Artificial intelligence in urology-opportunities and possibilities.', 'The impact of 3D models on positive surgical margins after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Results:   We investigated 61 ductal adenocarcinomas, 22 pure and 39 mixed ductal/acinar. Except for tumor growth pattern, none of the clinical parameters studied significantly differed between pure and mixed tumors. Thirty-five percent of ductal adenocarcinomas were organ confined, 15% displayed seminal vesicle invasion. Lymph node and distal metastasis occurred in 13% and 24% of cases, respectively; 34% of patients experienced biochemical failure, 7% died of disease. Ninety-eight percent of tumors expressed EZH2; in 80% of cases >50% of tumor cells were positive. ERG and SPINK1 were expressed in 20% and 36% of cases, respectively. There was no difference in protein expression between pure and mixed ductal adenocarcinomas. ERG expression tended to be lower, and SPINK1 higher than reported for acinar tumors.

Of particular interest is torsinA, which is mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE). Interestingly, mutations in the TOR1A gene (the gene encoding torsinA) are associated with DYT1 dystonia and with the preferential localization of mutated torsinA at the NE, where it is associated with lamina-associated polypeptide 1. A bioinformatics study of the torsinA interactome revealed reproductive processes to be highly relevant, as proteins in this class were found to interact with the former. Interestingly, the torsin protein family had never been previously described to be associated with the mammalian spermatogenic process. Histological staining of torsinA in human testis tissue revealed a granular cytoplasmic localization in mid- and late spermatocytes. We further sought to understand this newly discovered expression of torsinA in the meiotic phase of human spermatogenesis by studying its specific subcellular distribution.

Methods:   A total of 23 patients with bmPCa who received cryosurgery and adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were included in the cryosurgery group (Group 1). Another 23 matched patients who received only ADT served as the control (Group 2). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir level, time to PSA nadir, time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), progression-free survival and therapy response of bone metastases were compared between the groups.  Results:   The median follow-up time in Group 1 and Group 2 patients was 37 (range 19-53) months and 42 (range 24-56) months, respectively. Patients in Group 1 had fewer local complications, lower PSA nadir level (0.23 ng/mL vs. 4.01 ng/mL; p = 0.024), shorter median time to PSA nadir (3 months vs. 7 months; p < 0.001), longer median time to CRPC (36 months vs. 27 months; p = 0.002) and longer progression-free survival (35 months vs. 26 months; p = 0.003) compared to those in Group 2. Therapy responses of bone metastases were similar in the two treatment groups (p = 0.689).  Conclusion:   Cryosurgery is a feasible local therapy for bmPCa patients with prostate volume less than 50 mL and without bulk tumours outside the prostate capsula. Cryosurgery may decrease PSA nadir level, local complications and time to PSA nadir, delay time to CRPC and improve progression-free survival.""","""['Mingxiong Sheng', 'Lingling Wan', 'Changming Liu', 'Chunxiao Liu']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Singapore Med J""","""['EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The existence of a number of opioid receptors, including the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1), delta-opioid receptor (OPRD1), kappa-opioid receptor (OPRK1) and zeta-opioid receptor (OGFR) have been reported. However, the potential expression and role of these receptors on human prostate carcinogenesis is unknown. In the present study, we examined opioid receptor expression in human prostate cancer cell lines and in prostate cancer tissue. We observed using quantitative real-time PCR analysis that OGFR and OGFRL1 mRNA is expressed in all examined prostate cancer cell lines as well as in an immortalized, non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1). Conversely, OPRK1 mRNA expression was detected in a more limited number of cell lines (LNCaP and VCaP), while OPRD1 and OPRM1 mRNA expression was undetectable in all examined prostate cell lines. Interestingly, androgen sensitive LNCaP cells expressed high amounts of OPRK1, OGFR and OGFRL1 compared to other cell lines. Therefore, we investigated the effect of androgen on the mRNA expression of OPRK1, OGFR, OGFRL1 in the LNCaP cell line. Our results demonstrated that the synthetic androgen (R1881) represses mRNA of OPRK1, OGFR and OGFRL1 in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry demonstrated OGFR is expressed at high levels in prostate cancer tissue compared to benign tissue, and that OGFR expression is high in undifferentiated and aggressive prostate cancer tissue. This is the first study showing OGFR and OGFRL1 are androgen repressed genes, and these results suggest a role for the opioid signaling axis in prostate cancer.""","""['Hironobu Yamashita', 'Lauren Shuman', 'Joshua I Warrick', 'Jay D Raman', 'David J Degraff']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Am J Clin Exp Urol""","""['Morphine Suppresses Lung Cancer Cell Proliferation Through the Interaction with Opioid Growth Factor Receptor: An In Vitro and Human Lung Tissue Study.', 'Tumor necrosis factor-alpha represses androgen sensitivity in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line.', 'The expression and function of the OGF-OGFr axis - a tonically active negative regulator of growth - in COS cells.', 'Prospective oncotarget for gynecological cancer: Opioid growth factor (OGF) - opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) axis.', 'The biology of the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr).', 'Involvement of the Opioid Peptide Family in Cancer Progression.', 'Differential expression analysis of genes and long non-coding RNAs associated with KRAS mutation in colorectal cancer cells.', 'Comprehensive genomics in androgen receptor-dependent castration-resistant prostate cancer identifies an adaptation pathway mediated by opioid receptor kappa 1.', 'Opioids in cancer: The κ‑opioid receptor (Review).', 'Exploration of the Tumor Mutational Burden as a Prognostic Biomarker and Related Hub Gene Identification in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   We retrospectively reviewed clinicopathologic data of patients with prostate cancer who underwent LDR-BT between 2003 and 2011. Of 1569 patients reviewed, 689 (43.9%) received combination external beam radiotherapy, and 970 (61.8%) had neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. We stratified patients according to risk factors identified by multivariate analysis and assessed the factors for an association with BCR (defined as ≥2 ng/mL higher than the nadir).  Results:   The median followup was 96 months. Of 1531 patients who were BCR-free at 3 years after treatment, 76 subsequently developed BCR; of 1500 who were BCR-free at 5 years, 45 eventually had BCR. On multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for BCR were the National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group at diagnosis and PSA levels at 3 or 5 years after radiotherapy. In the low-risk group, no patient with a PSA level ≤0.2 ng/mL at 3 years after radiotherapy subsequently developed BCR. In the intermediate-risk group, no patients with a PSA level ≤0.2 ng/mL at 5 years subsequently developed BCR.

Methods and materials:   Androgen suppression combined with elective nodal and dose-escalated radiation therapy (the ASCENDE-RT trial) is a randomized control trial in which 276 high-risk and 122 intermediate-risk patients were randomized to (1) a standard arm with 12 months of androgen deprivation therapy, pelvic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to 46 Gy, and an EBRT boost (dose-escalated EBRT [DE-EBRT]) to 78 Gy, or (2) an experimental arm which substituted a low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy boost (LDR-PB). The primary endpoint was biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS) using the Phoenix threshold. In this reanalysis of ASCENDE-RT, the b-PFS using phoenix is compared to the surgical PSA threshold of >0.2 ng/mL.  Results:   Compared to nadir+2 ng/mL, the >0.2 ng/mL PSA threshold doubled the number of relapse events from 69 to 139. However, the increase was confined to the DE-EBRT subjects. The 7-year Kaplan-Meier b-PFS after DE-EBRT declined from 76% using nadir+2 ng/mL to 38% using the >0.2 ng/mL threshold (p < 0.001). Among the LDR-PB subset, there was no significant difference in b-PFS; the 7-year Kaplan-Meier b-PFS was 85% (>0.2 ng/mL) versus 88% (nadir+2 ng/mL) (p = 0.319).  Conclusions:   Replacing Phoenix with a surgical threshold greatly increased biochemical failure after DE-EBRT boost but had no effect after LDR-PB. As a result of this finding, PSA outcomes after surgery or brachytherapy can be directly compared by using the surgical definition of PSA failure. In this context, a brachytherapy boost appears to produce superior b-PFS compared to contemporary surgical series.""","""['W James Morris', 'Tom Pickles', 'Mira Keyes']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Androgen Suppression Combined with Elective Nodal and Dose Escalated Radiation Therapy (the ASCENDE-RT Trial): An Analysis of Survival Endpoints for a Randomized Trial Comparing a\xa0Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Boost to a\xa0Dose-Escalated External Beam Boost for High- and Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'After ASCENDE-RT: Biochemical and survival outcomes following combined external beam radiotherapy and low-dose-rate brachytherapy for high-risk and unfavourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, a population-based analysis.', 'ASCENDE-RT: An Analysis of Treatment-Related Morbidity for a Randomized Trial Comparing a Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Boost with a Dose-Escalated External Beam Boost for High- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', ""High-dose-rate intensity-modulated brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer: California endocurietherapy's 10-year results."", 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'Direct Comparison of Two Different Definitions with Biochemical Recurrence after Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Definitions of ""Cure"" After Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy in Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: Phoenix or Surgical?', 'Oncological and urinary outcomes following low-dose-rate brachytherapy with a median follow-up of 11.8\u2009years.', 'Stereotactic Radiation Therapy versus Brachytherapy: Relative Strengths of Two Highly Efficient Options for the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Low-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy (LDR-PB) adopts postsurgical PSA value for definition of cure.']"""

People living with HIV are at increased risk for AIDS-defining and non-AIDS-defining cancers, but little is known about their risk of first versus second primary cancers. We identified first and second primary cancers that occurred in above population expected numbers among people diagnosed with HIV in San Francisco, and compared first and second cancer incidence across five time periods that corresponded to important advances in antiretroviral therapy.  Methods:   In this population-based study, we used the San Francisco HIV/AIDS case registry to identify people aged 16 years and older who were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in San Francisco (CA, USA) between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2010. We computer-matched records from the registry with the California Cancer Registry to identify primary cancers diagnosed between Jan 1, 1985, and Dec 31, 2013. We calculated year, age, sex, and race adjusted standardised incidence ratios with exact 95% CIs and trends in incidence of first and second AIDS-defining and non-AIDS-defining cancers from 1985 to 2013.  Findings:   Of the 22 623 people diagnosed with HIV between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2010, we identified 5655 incident primary cancers. We excluded 48 cancers with invalid cancer sequence numbers and 1062 in-situ anal cancers, leaving 4545 incident primary cancers, comprising 4144 first primary cancers, 372 second primary cancers, 26 third primary cancers, and three fourth or later primary cancers. First primary cancer standardised incidence ratios were elevated for Kaposi sarcoma (127, 95% CI 121-132), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17·2, 16·1-18·4), invasive cervical cancer (8·0, 4·1-11·9), anal cancer (46·7, 39·7-53·6), vulvar cancer (13·3, 6·1-20·6), Hodgkin's lymphoma (10·4, 8·4-12·5), eye and orbit cancer (4·2, 1·4-6·9), lip cancer (3·8, 1·3-6·2), penile cancer (3·8, 1·4-6·1), liver cancer (3·0, 2·3-3·7), miscellaneous cancer (2·3, 1·7-3·0), testicular cancer (2·0, 1·4-2·6), tongue cancer (1·9, 1·1-2·7), and lung cancer (1·3, 95% CI 1·1-1·6). Second primary cancer risks were increased for Kaposi sarcoma (28·0, 95% CI 20·2-35·9), anal cancer (17·0, 10·2-23·8), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (11·1, 9·3-12·8), Hodgkin's lymphoma (5·4, 1·1-9·7), and liver cancer (3·6, 1·4-5·8). We observed lower first primary cancer standardised incidence ratios for prostate cancer (0·6, 95% CI 0·5-0·7), colon cancer (0·6, 0·4-0·8), and pancreatic cancer (0·6, 0·3-1·0), and lower second primary cancer standardised incidence ratios for testicular cancer (0·3, 0·0-0·9), kidney cancer (0·4, 0·0-0·9), and prostate cancer (0·6, 0·2-0·9). First and second primary AIDS-defining cancer incidence declined, and second primary non-AIDS-defining cancer incidence increased over time.  Interpretation:   Because of an increased risk for both first and second primary cancers, enhanced cancer prevention, screening, and treatment efforts are needed for people living with HIV both before and after initial cancer diagnosis.

Material and methods:   A retrospective study of 286 HRLPC patients diagnosed between 1996-2008, treated by RP (n=145) or RT+HT(n=141). Survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.

We hypothesized that focal therapy, treating only a portion of the prostate containing recurrent disease, might be equally effective and associated with less toxicity. The objectives of this prospective study were to explore the toxicities, quality of life, and efficacy of focal salvage high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in patients with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible, biopsy-confirmed local recurrence after previous definitive external beam radiation therapy.  Materials and methods:   Fifteen patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after external beam radiation therapy were enrolled in this prospective study. Patients were treated with ultrasound-based HDR brachytherapy with a prescription dose of 27 Gy divided in 2 implants, separated by 1 week, to the clinical target volume, which was defined as the quadrant of the prostate where the MRI-visible recurrent lesion was located. Toxicity, quality of life, and biochemical outcomes were analyzed. Postsalvage MRI was performed to assess radiation therapy response.  Results:   Median follow-up was 36 months. The median size of the recurrence on MRI was 9 mm (range, 7-20 mm), and clinical target volume at the time of HDR was 6.1 mL (range, 2.2-16.1 mL). Only one grade 3 genitourinary toxicity event was observed. No urinary retention was observed. Three-year prostate-specific antigen failure-free rate was 61%. There was no significant change in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite urinary or bowel domains over time. Of the 14 patients who had a post-HDR MRI, 12 had a treatment response.

Methods:   Three prostate cancer cell lines, androgen-dependent VCaP, androgen-independent PC-3 and DU-145, were used to obtain paclitaxel-resistant cells by progressively increasing the concentration of paclitaxel in the culture medium. Viability assays with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium and sulforhodamine B were used to assess the cell resistance level and cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel treatment. Total RNA was isolated from both prostate cancer cell lines and their resistant versions, and cDNA samples were reverse transcribed from total RNA. Selected target genes of miRNAs that showed differences in expression and were estimated to be effective on drug resistance mechanism were analyzed with western blot analysis.  Results:   Expression study of 86 miRNAs by RT-PCR demonstrated that several of the miRNAs were expressed at different levels in paclitaxel-resistant cells compared to wild-type cells. Moreover, the expression profiles of these miRNAs varied among different prostate cancer cell line types, with 13 miRNAs being up-regulated in the resistant cells. Among these, miR-200b-3p, miR-34b-3p and miR-375 exhibited a marked up-regulation. Further, miR-100-5p showed a prominent increase in paclitaxel-resistant VCaP-R and DU145-R cells.

The majority of patients initially respond well to abiraterone but the cancer cells evolve resistance and the cancer progresses within a median time of 16 months. Incorporating techniques that attempt to delay or prevent the growth of the resistant cancer cell phenotype responsible for disease progression have only recently entered the clinical setting. Here we use evolutionary game theory to model the evolutionary dynamics of patients with mCRPC subject to abiraterone therapy. In evaluating therapy options, we adopt an optimal control theory approach and seek the best treatment schedule using nonlinear constrained optimization. We compare patient outcomes from standard clinical treatments to those with other treatment objectives, such as maintaining a constant total tumor volume or minimizing the fraction of resistant cancer cells within the tumor. Our model predicts that continuous high doses of abiraterone as well as other therapies aimed at curing the patient result in accelerated competitive release of the resistant phenotype and rapid subsequent tumor progression. We find that long term control is achievable using optimized therapy through the restrained and judicious application of abiraterone, maintaining its effectiveness while providing acceptable patient quality of life. Implementing this strategy will require overcoming psychological and emotional barriers in patients and physicians as well as acquisition of a new class of clinical data designed to accurately estimate intratumoral eco-evolutionary dynamics during therapy.""","""['Jessica J Cunningham', 'Joel S Brown', 'Robert A Gatenby', 'Kateřina Staňková']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['Integrating evolutionary dynamics into treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Optimal sequencing of docetaxel and abiraterone in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Update on Systemic Prostate Cancer Therapies: Management of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in the Era of Precision Oncology.', 'Abiraterone acetate for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after chemotherapy: final analysis of a multicentre, open-label, early-access protocol trial.', 'Sequencing systemic therapies in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Effective dose window for containing tumor burden under tolerable level.', 'Morphodynamical cell state description via live-cell imaging trajectory embedding.', 'A survey of open questions in adaptive therapy: Bridging mathematics and clinical translation.', 'Abiraterone-Docetaxel scheduling for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on evolutionary dynamics.', 'Working with Convex Responses: Antifragility from Finance to Oncology.']"""

Phthalate esters are a class of environmental endocrine disruptors and were reported to be cancer promoting agents, however the potential role of phthalate esters in prostate cancer has been rarely reported. Mounting evidence has shown that miR-34a is a master tumor suppressor miRNA in cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), one of the typical phthalate esters, in cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Human prostate cancer LNCaP and PC-3 cells were exposed to low dose of BBP for 6 days. The results showed that 10-6 and 10-7 mol/L BBP increased the expression of cyclinD1 and PCNA, decreased p21 expression, and induced cell growth in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Furthermore, we found that BBP significantly downregulated the expression of miR-34a, along with upregulation of miR-34a target gene c-myc. Using cell tranfection of miR-34a mimic and inhibitor, we demonstrated that BBP promoted cell proliferation through miR-34a/c-myc axis in prostate cancer cells.

Currently, post-implant dosimetry is performed on CT images despite challenging target delineation due to limited soft tissue contrast. This work aims to develop an MRI-only workflow for post-implant dosimetry of prostate brachytherapy seeds.  Material and methods:   A prostate mimicking phantom containing twenty stranded I-125 dummy seeds and calcifications was constructed. A three-dimensional gradient-echo MR sequence was employed on 3T and 1.5T MR scanners. An optimized quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique was applied to generate positive contrast for the seeds and calcifications. Seed numbers, centroids, and orientations were determined using unsupervised machine learning algorithms (K-means and K-medoids clustering). The geometrical seed positions and the resulting dose distribution were compared to the clinical CT-based approach.  Results:   The optimized QSM-based method generated high quality positive contrast for the seeds that were significantly different from that for calcifications and could be easily differentiated by thresholding. The estimated seed centroids from both 3T and 1.5T MR data were in perfect agreement with the standard CT-based seed detection algorithm (maximum difference of 0.7 mm). The estimated seed orientations were highly correlated with the actual orientations (R > 0.98).

Different from the traditional task of classifying small pre-selected homogeneous regions, semantic segmentation provides pixel-wise Gleason predictions across an entire slide. Deep learning-based segmentation models can automatically learn visual semantics from data, which alleviates the need for feature engineering. However, performance of deep learning models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale fully annotated datasets, which can be both expensive and time-consuming to create. One way to address this problem is to leverage external weakly labeled datasets to augment models trained on the limited data. In this paper, we developed an expectation maximization-based approach constrained by an approximated prior distribution in order to extract useful representations from a large number of weakly labeled images generated from low-magnification annotations. This method was utilized to improve the performance of a model trained on a limited fully annotated dataset.

However, the biological function and underlying molecular mechanism of miR-326 in prostatic carcinoma (PCa) remains largely unknown. In the present study, we found that miR-326 expression level was significantly downregulated in both primary PCa and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) tissue samples as detected by qRT-PCR. Downregulation of miR-326 was closely associated with aggressive progression and poor prognosis of primary PCa patients. Gain- and lose- functional experiments revealed that forced expression of miR-326 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and promoted apoptosis in PCa cells in vitro, whereas, knockdown of miR-326 expression showed the opposite results. Overexpression of miR-326 also suppressed tumor growth in xenografted nude mice in vivo. Moreover, Luciferase reporter, qRT-PCR, and western blot assays identified that the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Mucin1 (MUC1) was a direct target region of miR-326. Spearman's correlation analysis also confirmed an inverse relationship between miR-326 and MUC1 expressions in primary PCa tissue samples. In addition, restoration of MUC1 expression effectively abrogated the inhibitory effects of miR-326 on PCa proliferation, invasion and migration through the activation of JNK signaling pathway.

Radiation therapy (RT) is widely considered a standard therapy for advanced as well as localized prostate cancer. Although this primary therapy is associated with high cancer control rates, up to one-third of patients undergoing radiation therapy becomes radio-resistant and/or has tumor-relapse/recurrence. Therefore, focus on new molecular targets and pathways is essential to develop novel radio-sensitizing agents for the effective and safe treatment of prostate cancer. Here, we describe functional studies that were performed to investigate the role of structural maintenance of chromosome-1 (SMC1A) in radioresistance of metastatic prostate cancer cells. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to suppress SMC1A in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, DU145 and PC3. Clonogenic survival assays, Western blot, RT-PCR, and γ-H2AX staining were used to assess the effect of SMC1A knockdown on radiation sensitivity of these prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate that SMC1A is overexpressed in human prostate tumors compared to the normal adjacent tissue. SMC1A knockdown limits the clonogenic potential, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cancer stem-like cell (CSC) properties of DU145 and PC3 cells and enhanced efficacy of RT in these cells. Targeted inhibition of SMC1A not only plays a critical role in overcoming radio-resistance in prostate cancer cells, but also suppresses self-renewal and the tumor-propagating potential of x-irradiated cancer cells.

Objective:   To quantify the costs to the Medicare program associated with detection and treatment of prostate cancer among elderly men in the United States.  Design, setting, and participants:   This nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study uses the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to identify men 70 years or older diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2004 and 2007 and to ascertain Medicare costs associated with diagnosis and workup, treatment, follow-up, and morbidity management of the disease. National Medicare costs were estimated using per-person costs, stage-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates by age from SEER 2007 through 2011, and 2010 Census population estimates by age.  Main outcomes and measures:   Estimated costs to the Medicare program overall, and in each (mutually exclusive) category related to diagnosis and workup, treatment, follow-up, and morbidity management.  Results:   This nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study included 49 692 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from the SEER-Medicare database (all participants were 70 years or older; 25 981 [52.3%] were 76 years or older). The median per-patient cost within 3 years after prostate cancer diagnosis was $14 453 (interquartile range [IQR], $4887-$27 899). The majority of this cost was attributable to treatment costs (median, $10 558; IQR, $1990-$23 718). Patients with a Gleason score of 6 or lower who pursued initial conservative management (no treatment within 12 months of diagnosis) had a 3-year median total cost of $1914 per patient. The estimated total 3-year cost to the Medicare program associated with the annual detection of prostate cancer in men 70 years or older is approximately $1.2 billion. Increasing active surveillance use in those with Gleason score of 6 or lower could reduce this cost by $320 million.  Conclusions and relevance:   There is substantial cost to the Medicare program associated with the diagnosis and treatment of localized prostate cancer among elderly men in the United States, despite the fact that these men are unlikely to die of prostate cancer. The majority of costs are related to treatment. Reducing provision of low-value health care services among this patient population could result in significant health care savings.""","""['Justin G Trogdon', 'Aaron D Falchook', 'Ramsankar Basak', 'William R Carpenter', 'Ronald C Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Fifteen-year Outcomes Following Conservative Management Among Men Aged 65 Years or Older with Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Estimating the healthcare costs of treating prostate cancer in Australia: A Markov modelling analysis.', 'Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Active Surveillance Strategies for Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Economic analysis of active surveillance for localized prostate cancer.', 'The economics of active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'Complex implementation factors demonstrated when evaluating cost-effectiveness and monitoring racial disparities associated with 18FDCFPyL PET/CT in prostate cancer men.', 'Health Care Costs Attributable to Prostate Cancer in British Columbia, Canada: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'A Novel Blood Proteomic Signature for Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer extracellular vesicle digital scoring assay - a rapid noninvasive approach for quantification of disease-relevant mRNAs.', 'Alcohol Abuse, Morbid Obesity, Depression, Congestive Heart Failure, and Chronic Pulmonary Disease are Risk Factors for 90-Day Readmission After Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair.']"""

Previous studies reported that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) expression is increased in human prostate cancer. Here, we show that Camkk2 deletion or pharmacologic inhibition protects against prostate cancer development in a preclinical mouse model that lacks expression of prostate-specific Pten. In contrast, deletion of AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk) β1 resulted in earlier onset of adenocarcinoma development. These findings suggest for the first time that Camkk2 and Ampk have opposing effects in prostate cancer progression. Loss of CAMKK2 in vivo or in human prostate cancer cells reduced the expression of two key lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. This reduction was mediated via a posttranscriptional mechanism, potentially involving a decrease in protein translation. Moreover, either deletion of CAMKK2 or activation of AMPK reduced cell growth in human prostate cancer cells by inhibiting de novo lipogenesis. Activation of AMPK in a panel of human prostate cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as androgen-receptor signaling. These findings demonstrate that CAMKK2 and AMPK have opposing effects on lipogenesis, providing a potential mechanism for their contrasting effects on prostate cancer progression in vivo. They also suggest that inhibition of CAMKK2 combined with activation of AMPK would offer an efficacious therapeutic strategy in treatment of prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that CAMKK2 and its downstream target AMPK have opposing effects on prostate cancer development and raise the possibility of a new combined therapeutic approach that inhibits CAMKK2 and activates AMPK.""","""['Lucy Penfold', 'Angela Woods', 'Phillip Muckett', 'Alexander Yu Nikitin', 'Tera R Kent', 'Shuai Zhang', 'Rebecca Graham', 'Alice Pollard', 'David Carling']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Inhibition of CAMKK2 impairs autophagy and castration-resistant prostate cancer via suppression of AMPK-ULK1 signaling.', 'Concurrent regulation of LKB1 and CaMKK2 in the activation of AMPK in castrate-resistant prostate cancer by a well-defined polyherbal mixture with anticancer properties.', 'Salicylate activates AMPK and synergizes with metformin to reduce the survival of prostate and lung cancer cells ex vivo through inhibition of de novo lipogenesis.', 'Regulation and role of CAMKK2 in prostate cancer.', ""Targeting the 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and related metabolic pathways for the treatment of prostate cancer."", 'Investigation of enzalutamide, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel resistance in the castration resistant prostate cancer cell line C4 using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening.', 'The role of CaMKK2 in Golgi-associated vesicle trafficking.', 'Androgen receptor signaling-mitochondrial DNA-oxidative phosphorylation: A critical triangle in early prostate cancer.', 'SGC-CAMKK2-1: A Chemical Probe for CAMKK2.', 'New insights into activation and function of the AMPK.']"""

However, men invariably progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and AR reactivation contributes to progression in most cases. To identify mechanisms that may drive CRPC, we examined a VCaP prostate cancer xenograft model as tumors progressed from initial androgen sensitivity prior to castration to castration resistance and then on to relapse after combined therapy with further AR-targeted drugs (abiraterone plus enzalutamide). AR activity persisted in castration-resistant and abiraterone/enzalutamide-resistant xenografts and was associated with increased expression of the AR gene and the AR-V7 splice variant. We then assessed expression of individual AR-regulated genes to identify those that persisted, thereby contributing to tumor growth, versus those that decreased and may therefore exhibit tumor suppressor activities. The most significantly decreased AR target gene was dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which encodes a membrane-anchored protein that cleaves dipeptides from multiple growth factors, resulting in their increased degradation. DPP4 mRNA and protein were also decreased in clinical CRPC cases, and inhibition of DPP4 with sitagliptin enhanced the growth of prostate cancer xenografts following castration. Significantly, DPP4 inhibitors are frequently used to treat type 2 diabetes as they increase insulin secretion. Together, these results implicate DPP4 as an AR-regulated tumor suppressor gene whose loss enhances growth factor activity and suggest that treatment with DPP4 inhibitors may accelerate emergence of resistance to ADT.Significance: These findings identify DPP4 as an AR-stimulated tumor suppressor gene that is downregulated during progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer, warning that treatment with DPP4 inhibitors, commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, may accelerate prostate cancer progression following androgen deprivation therapy.

Identification of the mechanisms by which CRPCs evade androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) is critical to develop novel therapeutics. We uncovered that CRPCs rely on BRD4-HOXB13 epigenetic reprogramming for androgen-independent cell proliferation. Mechanistically, BRD4, a member of the BET bromodomain family, epigenetically promotes HOXB13 expression. Consistently, genetic disruption of HOXB13 or pharmacological suppression of its mRNA and protein expression by the novel dual-activity BET bromodomain-kinase inhibitors directly correlates with rapid induction of apoptosis, potent inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and cell migration, and suppression of CRPC growth. Integrative analysis revealed that the BRD4-HOXB13 transcriptome comprises a proliferative gene network implicated in cell-cycle progression, nucleotide metabolism, and chromatin assembly. Notably, although the core HOXB13 target genes responsive to BET inhibitors (HOTBIN10) are overexpressed in metastatic cases, in ADT-treated CRPC cell lines and patient-derived circulating tumor cells (CTC) they are insensitive to AR depletion or blockade. Among the HOTBIN10 genes, AURKB and MELK expression correlates with HOXB13 expression in CTCs of mCRPC patients who did not respond to abiraterone (ABR), suggesting that AURKB inhibitors could be used additionally against high-risk HOXB13-positive metastatic prostate cancers. Combined, our study demonstrates that BRD4-HOXB13-HOTBIN10 regulatory circuit maintains the malignant state of CRPCs and identifies a core proproliferative network driving ADT resistance that is targetable with potent dual-activity bromodomain-kinase inhibitors.""","""['Niveditha Nerlakanti#', 'Jiqiang Yao#', 'Duy T Nguyen#', 'Ami K Patel#', 'Alexey M Eroshkin', 'Harshani R Lawrence', 'Muhammad Ayaz', 'Brent M Kuenzi', 'Neha Agarwal', 'Yunyun Chen', 'Steven Gunawan', 'Rezaul M Karim', 'Norbert Berndt', 'John Puskas', 'Anthony M Magliocco', 'Domenico Coppola', 'Jasreman Dhillon', 'Jingsong Zhang', 'Subramaniam Shymalagovindarajan', 'Uwe Rix', 'Youngchul Kim', 'Ranjan Perera', 'Nicholas J Lawrence', 'Ernst Schonbrunn', 'Kiran Mahajan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Acetylated HOXB13 Regulated Super Enhancer Genes Define Therapeutic Vulnerabilities of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'BRD4 Regulates Metastatic Potential of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer through AHNAK.', 'Therapeutic targeting of BET bromodomain proteins in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BET bromodomain inhibitors--a novel epigenetic approach in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Shaping Chromatin States in Prostate Cancer by Pioneer Transcription Factors.', 'To bind or not to bind: Cistromic reprogramming in prostate cancer.', 'Study on the Expression of lncRNA ATB and Nek9 in Breast Cancer Patients Based on Q-PCR Technology and Its Relationship with the Disease.', 'Acetylated HOXB13 Regulated Super Enhancer Genes Define Therapeutic Vulnerabilities of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Nuclear Receptor Coregulators in Hormone-Dependent Cancers.', 'Choosing Kinase Inhibitors for Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, the variation in antidepressant use among individuals throughout the survivorship period is unknown. We sought to examine the variation and trends in receipt of antidepressants after PCa treatment, among patients with nonmetastatic PCa. Using population-based linked administrative data, we identified men ≥66 yr old who underwent surgery (n=4952), radiotherapy (n=4994), or surveillance (n=2136), and these men were matched to general population controls (n=57127). One year prior to PCa treatment, 7.7% of men received an antidepressant prescription, which increased to 10.5% in the year after treatment. In difference-in-differences analysis, adjusted for demographic and health characteristics, men had increased odds of antidepressant receipt up to 5 yr after surgery (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-1.64; p≤0.0001) or radiotherapy (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.21-1.47; p≤0.0001). Men did not have an increased risk of antidepressant receipt up to 5 yr after surveillance (OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.94-1.41; p=0.16). Limitations include the potential for selection bias and misclassification due to the retrospective design of the study and the use of administrative databases. Thus, men with nonmetastatic PCa who initially receive surgery or radiotherapy, but not those who initially undergo surveillance, have an increased risk of antidepressant receipt after treatment. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we examined antidepressant prescription for men after treatment of nonmetastatic prostate cancer across the entire population of men ≥66 yr in Ontario, Canada, from 2002 to 2009. For men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer, the risk of antidepressant receipt at 5 yr after treatment was significantly increased after surgery or radiotherapy, but not after surveillance.

We examined the differential effect of the recommendation on PCPs' PSA screening by physician seniority and evaluated the impact of their individual stated opinions on their screening practices.  Methods:   We reviewed 54,684 PCP-directed PSA orders within a tertiary care academic institution from January 2010 to July 2015. Relative proportions of PSA orders per overall unique male ambulatory clinic volume were assessed for the periods of January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011 (first period) and January 1, 2013 to July 31, 2015 (second period). A survey was subsequently sent to providers in the cohort assessing their attitudes toward the United States Preventative Services Task Force recommendation and responses were compared to physician seniority and actual PSA ordering habits.  Results:   Of 88 total PCPs assessed, 22 met criteria for inclusion. Overall unique male nononcology care patients were 88,558 for the first period and 140,173 for the second period. Overall proportion of unique male patients screened did not change and proportion of overall unique male patients screened vs. time since residency demonstrated a significant negative trend (R2 = 0.308, P = 0.007, slope of trend line -0.000005). A subsequent survey revealed no correlation of any aspect of the questionnaire with actual real-world screening practice but did note a paradoxical positive association between physician seniority and stated PSA use.  Conclusion:   From January 2010 to July 2015 PSA screening did not change greatly for providers in continuous practice throughout the period. Time since residency completion was significantly associated with screening proportionally fewer men. Provider opinion did not appear to have a strong influence on actual physician practice. These findings further inform future efforts to alter PSA screening.""","""['Ryan Hutchinson', 'Nirmish Singla', 'Abdulhadi Akhtar', 'Justin Haridas', 'Deepa Bhat', 'Claus Roehrborn', 'Yair Lotan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'Primary care physician PSA screening practices before and after the final U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation.', 'Testing and referral patterns in the years surrounding the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation against prostate-specific antigen screening.', 'The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the USA.', 'Relevance of total PSA and free PSA prescriptions.']"""

The oncogenic transcription factor ERG is commonly induced by a typical TMPRSS2-ERG (TE) gene fusion in CaP and may affect innervation. Here, we analyzed whether nerve density of CaP tissue is related to TE status or perineural infiltration status of CaP tissue. In parallel, we measured several members of the neuropilin/plexin/semaphorin family (NRP, PLXN, and SEMA) as possible targets mediating innervation. The TE-gene-fusion status was determined at the mRNA level in CaP tissues by nested RT-PCR. Transcript levels were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in CaP tissue or cell line homogenate. ERG was analyzed by immunostaining, and the nerve density was evaluated by immunostaining for PGP9.5 and axonal neurofilament. Data were analyzed by correlation (Spearman), linear regression, Mann-Whitney U test, and contingency table analyses. TE-positive (TE-1) vs. TE-negative (TE-0) CaP tissues displayed significantly enhanced ERG-mRNA levels (TE-0: -4.183; TE-1: -2.994, P < 0.001) and ERG immunostaining (Erg-IH score; TE-0: 0.4211; TE-1: 1.391; P < 0.0001). Notably, the nerve density was significantly increased in CaP tissue samples with positive TE status compared to negative TE status (TE-0, ND score = 1.5; TE-1, ND score = 2.0; P <0.01). NRP1, NRP2, PLXNA2, PLXNB1, SEMA3A, and SEMA4B mRNAs were detectable in CaP tissues and CaP cell lines at quite heterogeneous levels. In CaP tissues, we observed significant positive correlations of ERG with NRP2, PLXNA2, PLXNB1, and SEMA4B. TE-positive CaP tissues displayed enhanced nerve density.

Inter-planner variability is reduced in RapidPlan-assisted planning for rectum and femoral heads while bladder variability was constant. The inter-planner variability of the overall plan quality, IQR of PQM%, was approximately halved for all patients. RapidPlan assistance induced a larger increase in plan quality for less experienced planners. At the same time, a reduction in intra-planner variability is measured with a significant overall reduction.  Conclusions:   The assistance of RapidPlan during the optimization of treatments for prostate cancer induces a significant increase of plan quality and a contextual reduction of plan variability. RapidPlan is proven to be a valuable tool to leverage the planning skills of less experienced planners ensuring a better homogeneity of treatment plan quality.""","""['Alessandro Scaggion', 'Marco Fusella', 'Antonella Roggio', 'Simonetta Bacco', 'Nicola Pivato', 'Marco Andrea Rossato', 'Lucia Mariel Arana Peña', 'Marta Paiusco']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Inter-planner variation in treatment-plan quality of plans created with a knowledge-based treatment planning system.', 'Efficiently train and validate a RapidPlan model through APQM scoring.', 'Can the Student Outperform the Master?

The aim of our study was to provide insights in radiotherapy (RT)-treatment of recurrent PCA exhibiting ln- or osseous (oss)-oligometastases.  Methods:   Between April 2012 and April 2017, 27 oligometastatic PCA patients (19 ln and 8 single oss) were treated with RT at our institution.  Results:   The metastasis-free survival (MFS) was 24.8 m (22.0-36.0 m) and 25.4 m (23.9-28.1 m) for the ln- and oss-subgroup resulting in 1-year MFS of 75.4 and 100% and 2-year MFS of 58.7 and 83.3% for ln- and oss-metastatic patients, respectively. Of notice, none of the recurrences for ln-patients was in the RT-field, constituting a local control of 100%. Within the ln-group, pre-RT median-PSA was 2.6 ng/ml, median post-RT PSA was 0.3 ng/ml, which was significant (p = 0.003). Median biochemical-free survival (bfS) was 12.2 m. PCA that was initially confined to the prostate had a better bfS (p < 0.001) and MFS (p = 0.013). The oss-group had a median PSA of 4.9 ng/ml pre-treatment which dropped to a median value of 0.14 ng/ml (p = 0.004). Toxicities were moderate, with only 1 case of III° toxicity. There were no deaths in the ln-group, thus overall survial was 100% here.  Conclusion:   Our study points out the feasibility of RT as a treatment option in recurrent PCA and demonstrates an excellent local control with a low-toxicity profile.""","""['M Oertel', 'S Scobioala', 'K Kroeger', 'A Baehr', 'L Stegger', 'U Haverkamp', 'M Schäfers', 'H-T Eich']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer Detected via Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography.', 'Adjuvant radiation therapy is associated with better oncological outcome compared with salvage radiation therapy in patients with pN1 prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Does Choline PET/CT Change the Management of Prostate Cancer Patients With Biochemical Failure?', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Early salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy.', 'Radiotherapy of oligometastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Contribution of Serum Biomarkers to Prognostic Assessment in Patients With Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study is based on 5,174 men aged 50-66 years, who in 1995-1996 participated in the first round of the Göteborg randomized screening trial (initial T-PSA level <3 ng/mL). These men were subsequently invited biennially for PSA and F/T PSA screening until they reached the upper age limit (on average 69 years). Biopsy was recommended if PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 18.9 years, 754 men (14.6%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer (PC). The overall cumulative PC incidence was 17.2%. It increased from 7.9% among men with T-PSA of ≤0.99 ng/mL to 26.0% in men with T-PSA levels of 1-1.99 ng/mL and 40.3% in men between 2-2.99 ng/mL (p < 0.001). The initial PSA was also related to the incidence of Gleason ≥7 PC (3.7% vs 9.7% vs 10.9%) and PC death (0.3% vs 1.1% vs 1.5%). Adding F/T PSA did not improve PC prediction in terms of Harrell concordance index (base model 0.76 vs 0.76) nor improvement of the likelihood of the model (p = 0.371).

The formation of steroids was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in LNCaP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells, and in human prostate tissues, following incubation with steroid precursors (22-OH-cholesterol, pregnenolone, 17-OH-pregnenolone, progesterone, 17-OH-progesterone). Pregnenolone, progesterone, 17-OH-pregnenolone, and 17-OH-progesterone increased C21 steroid (5-pregnan-3,20-dione, 5-pregnan-3,17-diol-20-one, 5-pregnan-3-ol-20-one) formation in the backdoor pathway, and demonstrated a trend of stimulating dihydroepiandrosterone or its precursors in the backdoor pathway in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. The precursors differentially affected steroidogenic enzyme messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions in the cell lines. The steroidogenesis following incubation of human prostate tissue with 17-OH-pregnenolone and progesterone produced trends similar to those observed in cell lines. Interestingly, the formation of C21 steroids from classical pathway was not stimulated but backdoor pathway steroids (e.g., 5-pregnan-3,20-dione, 5-pregnan-3-ol-20-one) were elevated following incubations with prostate tissues. Overall, C21 steroids were predominantly formed in the classical as well as backdoor pathways, and steroid precursors induced a diversion of steroidogenesis to the backdoor pathway in both cell lines and human prostate tissue, and influenced adaptive steroidogenesis to form C21 steroids.""","""['Subrata Deb', 'Steven Pham', 'Dong-Sheng Ming', 'Mei Yieng Chin', 'Hans Adomat', 'Antonio Hurtado-Coll', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Steroidogenesis in Peripheral and Transition Zones of Human Prostate Cancer Tissue.', 'The 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione pathway and C11-oxy C21 backdoor pathway are active in benign prostatic hyperplasia yielding 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-progesterone.', 'CYP17A1 exhibits 17αhydroxylase/17,20-lyase activity towards 11β-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-ketoprogesterone metabolites in the C11-oxy backdoor pathway.', 'Pathways and genes involved in steroid hormone metabolism in male pigs: a review and update.', 'Assessment of steroidogenesis and steroidogenic enzyme functions.', 'Bioactive C21 Steroidal Glycosides from Euphorbia kansui Promoted HepG2 Cell Apoptosis via the Degradation of ATP1A1 and Inhibited Macrophage Polarization under Co-Cultivation.', 'Preclinical and Clinical Research Models of Prostate Cancer: A Brief Overview.', 'In Vitro Analysis of Deoxynivalenol Influence on Steroidogenesis in Prostate.', 'Inhibition of Scavenger Receptor Class B Type 1 (SR-B1) Expression and Activity as a Potential Novel Target to Disrupt Cholesterol Availability in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Steroidogenesis in Peripheral and Transition Zones of Human Prostate Cancer Tissue.']"""

Thailand established its cancer registry in 1986; however, studies focusing on data reliability have been limited. This study aimed to assess the coding completeness and reliability of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) hospital-based cancer registry, Thailand.  Methods:   This study was conducted using the reabstracting method. We focused on seven cancer sites-the colon, rectum, liver, lung, breast, cervix, and prostate-registered between 2012 and 2014 in the NCI hospital-based cancer registry. Missing data were identified for coding completeness calculation among important variables. The agreement rate and κ coefficient were computed to represent data reliability.  Results:   For reabstracting, we retrieved 957 medical records from a total of 5,462. These were selected using the probability proportional to size method, stratified by topology, sex, and registered year. The overall coding completeness of the registered and reabstracted data was 89.9% and 93.6%, respectively. In addition, the overall agreement rate among variables ranged from 84.7% to 99.6%, and κ coefficient ranged from 0.619 to 0.995. The misclassification among unilateral organs caused lower coding completeness and agreement rate of laterality coding. The completeness of current residency could be improved using the reabstracting method. The lowest agreement rate was found among various categories of diagnosis basis. Sex misclassification for male breast cancer was identified.

A population-based cancer registry has been used in Addis Ababa (the capital city) since 2011. Availability of up-to-date estimates on cancer incidence is important in guiding the national cancer control program in Ethiopia.  Methods:   We obtained primary data on 8,539 patients from the Addis Ababa population-based cancer registry and supplemented by data on 1,648 cancer cases collected from six Ethiopian regions. We estimated the number of the commonest forms of cancer diagnosed among males and females in Ethiopia and computed crude and age-standardized incidence rates.  Results:   For 2015 in Ethiopia, we estimated that 21,563 (95% CI, 17,416 to 25,660) and 42,722 (95% CI, 37,412 to 48,040) incident cancer cases were diagnosed in males and females, respectively. The most common adult cancers were: cancers of the breast and cervix, colorectal cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and cancers of the prostate, thyroid, lung, stomach, and liver. Leukemia was the leading cancer diagnosis in the pediatric age group (age 0 to 14 years). Breast cancer was by far the commonest cancer, constituting 33% of the cancers in women and 23% of all cancers identified from the Addis Ababa cancer registry. It was also the commonest cancer in four of the six Ethiopian regions included in the analysis. Colorectal cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were the commonest malignancies in men.  Conclusion:   Cancer, and more prominently breast cancer, poses a substantial public health threat in Ethiopia.

However, the burden of the disease is expected to increase, affecting developing countries, including Thailand. We undertook an analysis to investigate current and future trends of prostate cancer in the province of Songkhla, Thailand, using data from the Songkhla Cancer Registry from 1990 to 2013.  Methods:   Joinpoint regression analysis was used to examine trends in age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer and provide estimated annual percent change (EAPC) with 95% CIs. Age-period-cohort (APC) models were used to assess the effect of age, calendar year, and birth cohort on incidence and mortality rates. Three different methods (Joinpoint, Nordpred, and APC) were used to project trends from 2013 to 2030.  Results:   Eight hundred fifty-five cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed from 1990 to 2013 in Songkhla, Thailand. The incidence rates of prostate cancer significantly increased since 1990 at an EAPC of 4.8% (95% CI, 3.6% to 5.9%). Similarly, mortality rates increased at an EAPC of 5.3% (95% CI, 3.4% to 7.2%). The APC models suggest that birth cohort is the most important factor driving the increased incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer. Future incidence and mortality of prostate cancer are projected to continue to increase, doubling the rates observed in 2013 by 2030.

In 2015, 103 Japanese patients with PCA were asked about their SDM preferences by using an Internet-based 5-point-scale questionnaire. Concurrently, 127 Japanese physicians were surveyed regarding their perceptions of patient preferences on SDM. Drivers of preferences and perceptions were analyzed using univariable ordinal logistic regression and graphing the fitted response probabilities. Although 41% of both patients and physicians expressed and expected a desire for active involvement in treatment decisions (a higher rate than in a similar study for the United States in 2001), almost half the Japanese patients preferred SDM, but only 33% of physicians assumed this was their choice. That is, 29% of Japanese physicians underestimated patients' preference for involvement in making treatment decisions. Patients with lower health-related quality of life (as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate [FACT-P]) expressed a stronger preference for SDM. The study shows that the worse the medical situation, the more patients with PCA prefer to be involved in the treatment decision, yet physicians tend to underestimate the preferences of their patients. Perhaps in contrast to common assumptions, Japanese patients are as interested in being involved in decision making as are patients in the United States.""","""['Ulrike Schaede', 'Jörg Mahlich', 'Masahiko Nakayama', 'Hisanori Kobayashi', 'Yuriko Takahashi', 'Katsuhiko Saito', 'Hiroji Uemura', 'Masayuki Tokumitsu', 'Kazutake Yoshizawa']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Glob Oncol""","""[""Shared decision making, physicians' explanations, and treatment satisfaction: a cross-sectional survey of prostate cancer patients."", 'Ethical decision making and patient autonomy: a comparison of physicians and patients in Japan and the United States.', 'Treatment decisions for breast carcinoma: patient preferences and physician perceptions.', 'Shared decision making in surgery: a scoping review of patient and surgeon preferences.', ""Patient preferences versus physicians' judgement: does it make a difference in healthcare decision making?"", 'Getting specific: participation preference in urooncological decision-making.', ""Eliciting men's preferences for decision-making relative to treatments of localized prostate cancer with a good or moderate prognosis."", ""Discrete Choice Experiment to Understand Japanese Patients' and Physicians' Preferences for Preventive Treatments for Migraine."", 'Lung Cancer Screening: Implementation Challenges and Health Equity Considerations For the Western Pacific Region.', 'The relationship between evaluation of shared decision-making by pet owners and veterinarians and satisfaction with veterinary consultations.']"""

Results:   Among the 197 patients included, 68 (34%) were younger than 65 years, 85 (43%) were 65 to 74 years, and 44 (22%) were 75 years or older. The mean number of comorbidities was not different among groups (1.19 v 1.32 v 1.43; P = .54). Patients younger than 65 years received a higher cumulative dose of docetaxel (450 mg/m2 v 382 mg/m2 v 300 mg/m2; P = .004). The rates of PSA decline of 50% or greater (41% v 47% v 36.4%; P = .51) and the median TTP (5.13 v 5.13 v 4.7 months; P = .15) were comparable among all groups. The median OS was longer in the group of patients younger than age 65 years (19.6 v 12.4 v 12.3 months; P = .012). Rates of any grade 3 or higher adverse event were not different among groups (63.2% v 71.8% v 54.5%; P = .14).  Conclusion:   Administration of docetaxel in elderly patients who had good performance status was well tolerated. Rates of PSA decline and TTP were similar to those of younger patients, but median survival was lower.""","""['Manuel Caitano Maia', 'Allan A Lima Pereira', 'Liana Valente Lage', 'Natalia Moreno Fraile', 'Victor Van Vaisberg', 'Guilherme Kudo', 'Romualdo Barroso-Sousa', 'Diogo Assed Bastos', 'Carlos Dzik']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Glob Oncol""","""['Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate in an elderly patient subgroup (aged 75 and older) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after docetaxel-based chemotherapy.', 'A retrospective, Canadian multi-center study examining the impact of prior response to abiraterone acetate on efficacy of docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Docetaxel Treatment of Prostate Cancer: From Discovery to Implementation.', 'Metronomic Chemotherapy for Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Treatment Patterns Among Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer in Brazil: An Analysis of a Private Healthcare System Database.', 'Real-world utilization and outcomes of docetaxel among older men with metastatic prostate cancer: a retrospective population-based cohort study in Canada.', 'Safety of PSMA-Targeted Molecular Radioligand Therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-617: Results from the Prospective Multicenter Phase 2 Trial RESIST-PC (NCT03042312).', 'Exposure to Docetaxel in the Elderly Patient Population: a Population Pharmacokinetic Study.', 'Concepts in geriatric uro-oncology.']"""

This retrospective study determined the accuracy of mpMRI predicting Gleason score and index lesion location at the time of RP, the current gold standard for diagnosis.  Methods:   Between April 2013 and April 2016, a database of all men aged more than 40 years who underwent RP after positive transrectal ultrasound biopsy by an experienced urological surgeon was collated at a single regional centre. This was cross-referenced with a database of all men who had mpMRIs performed at a single centre and reported according to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS version 1) during this period to generate a sample size of 64 men. A Spearman's rho test was utilized to calculate correlation.  Results:   Median age of patients was 64 years, the median prostate-specific antigen at RP was 6.22 ng/mL. mpMRI was positive (≥PI-RADS 3) in 85.9% of patients who underwent RP. More than 92% of participants had Gleason ≥7 disease. A positive relationship between mpMRI prostate PI-RADS score and RP cancer volume was demonstrated. An anatomical location correlation calculated in octants was found to be 89.1% accurate.

We propose a novel MRI molecular tetrameric probe based on the heptadentate gadolinium (Gd)-AAZTA (6-amino-6-methylperhydro-1,4-diazepinetetraacetic acid) that is able to in vivo detect PCa through the recognition of the fibrin-fibronectin (FB-FN) complex.  Methods:   The peptide CREKA (Cys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Ala), targeting the FB-FN complex in the reactive stroma of the tumor, was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and conjugated to the tetramer dL-(Gd-AAZTA)4 . The resulting probe was characterized by 1 H relaxometry, tested in vitro on FB clots and in vivo on an orthotopic mouse model of PCa.  Results:   CREKA-dL-(Gd-AAZTA)4 showed a remarkable relaxivity of 18.2 m MGd-1s-1 (0.47 T, 25°C) because of the presence of 2 water molecules (q = 2) in the inner coordination sphere of each Gd3+ ion, whose rotational motion (τR ) is lengthened as the result of the relatively high molecular weight. The probe displayed a detectable affinity for plasma-derived FB clots. On intravenous injection of the probe in an orthotopic mouse model of PCa, a significant increase in the prostate T1 contrast (~40%) was observed. The MRI signal appears statistically higher either with respect to the one observed for the control probes and to the one detected when CREKA-dL-(Gd-AAZTA)4 was administered to healthy animals.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated the ability of the CREKA-dL-(Gd-AAZTA)4 probe to specifically localize in prostate tumor after injection. The high relaxivity of the probe allows the reduction of the injected dose to 20 µmolGd /kg, yielding a good in vivo contrast enhancement in the region of prostate tumor.""","""['Amerigo Pagoto', 'Martina Tripepi', 'Rachele Stefania', 'Stefania Lanzardo', 'Dario Livio Longo', 'Francesca Garello', 'Francesco Porpiglia', 'Matteo Manfredi', 'Silvio Aime', 'Enzo Terreno']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Magn Reson Med""","""['Synthesis of High Relaxivity Gadolinium AAZTA Tetramers as Building Blocks for Bioconjugation.', 'Peptide targeted tripod macrocyclic Gd(III) chelates for cancer molecular MRI.', 'Synthesis and Assessment of Peptide Gd-DOTA Conjugates Targeting Extradomain B Fibronectin for Magnetic Resonance Molecular Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', '(Biotin-Ala-Ser-Lys-Lys-Pro-Lys-Arg-Asn-Ile-Lys-Ala)4-dendrimer-streptavidin-biotin-gadolinium 1,4,7-tris(carboxymethyl)-10-(2’-hydroxypropyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-loaded apoferritin.', '(1-(2-(β-Galactopyranosyloxy)propyl)-4,7,10-tris(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane) gadolinium(III).', 'Derivatives of GdAAZTA Conjugated to Amino Acids: A Multinuclear and Multifrequency NMR Study.']"""

As we recently demonstrated that plasma ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT)-enzyme is significantly elevated in PCa-patients compared with healthy-controls, using a limited patients-cohort, we aimed to further explore the potential of GOAT to improve PCa diagnosis using an ample patients-cohort (n = 312) and defining subgroups (i.e. significant PCa/metastatic patients, etc.) that could benefit from this biomarker. Plasma GOAT-levels were evaluated by ELISA in patients with (n = 183) and without (n = 129) PCa. Gleason Score ≥ 7 was considered clinically significant PCa. GOAT-levels were higher in PCa patients vs control patients, and in those with significant PCa vs non-significant PCa. GOAT-levels association with the diagnoses of significant PCa was independent from traditional clinical variables (i.e. PSA/age/DRE). Remarkably, GOAT outperformed PSA in patients with PSA-levels ranging 3-20 ng/mL for the significant PCa diagnosis [GOAT-AUC = 0.612 (0.531-0.693) vs PSA-AUC = 0.494 (0.407-0.580)]. A panel of key variables including GOAT/age/DRE/testosterone also outperformed the same panel but with PSA [AUC = 0.720 (0.710-0.730) vs AUC = 0.705 (0.695-0.716), respectively]. Notably, GOAT-levels could also represent a novel predictive biomarker of aggressiveness, as its levels are positively associated with Gleason Score and the presence of metastasis at the time of diagnoses.

PSMA/GCPII is also expressed in many healthy tissues, but its function has only been established in the brain and small intestine. Several research groups have attempted to produce PSMA/GCPII-deficient mice to study the physiological role of PSMA/GCPII in detail. The outcomes of these studies differ dramatically, ranging from embryonic lethality to production of viable PSMA/GCPII-deficient mice without any obvious phenotype.  Methods:   We produced PSMA/GCPII-deficient mice (hereafter also referred as Folh1-/- mice) by TALEN-mediated mutagenesis on a C57BL/6NCrl background. Using Western blot and an enzyme activity assay, we confirmed the absence of PSMA/GCPII in our Folh1-/- mice. We performed anatomical and histopathological examination of selected tissues with a focus on urogenital system. We also examined the PSMA/GCPII expression profile within the mouse urogenital system using an enzyme activity assay and confirmed the presence of PSMA/GCPII in selected tissues by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Our Folh1-/- mice are viable, breed normally, and do not show any obvious phenotype. Nevertheless, aged Folh1-/- mice of 69-72 weeks exhibit seminal vesicle dilation, which is caused by accumulation of luminal fluid. This phenotype was also observed in Folh1+/- mice; the overall difference between our three cohorts (Folh1-/- , Folh1+/- , and Folh1+/+ ) was highly significant (P < 0.002). Of all studied tissues of the mouse urogenital system, only the epididymis appeared to have a physiologically relevant level of PSMA/GCPII expression. Additional experiments demonstrated that PSMA/GCPII is also present in the human epididymis.  Conclusions:   In this study, we provide the first evidence characterizing the reproductive tissue phenotype of PSMA/GCPII-deficient mice. These findings will help lay the groundwork for future studies to reveal PSMA/GCPII function in human reproduction.""","""['Barbora Vorlová', 'František Sedlák', 'Petr Kašpárek', 'Karolína Šrámková', 'Marek Malý', 'Josef Zámečník', 'Pavel Šácha', 'Jan Konvalinka']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Clinical utility of genetic variants of glutamate carboxypeptidase II in predicting breast cancer and prostate cancer risk.', 'Expression pattern of mouse homolog of prostate-specific membrane antigen (FOLH1) in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate model.', 'The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of the prostate specific membrane antigen/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (PSMA/GCPII) in cancer and neurological disease.', 'Association of glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) haplotypes with breast and prostate cancer risk.', 'Looking for Drugs in All the Wrong Places: Use of GCPII Inhibitors Outside the Brain.', 'More Than Meets the Eye: Scientific Rationale behind Molecular Imaging and Therapeutic Targeting of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) in Metastatic Prostate Cancer and Beyond.']"""

This paper reports a microfluidic platform integrating magnetic-based single bead trapping in conjunction with acoustic micromixing for simultaneous detection of multiple cancer biomarkers within minutes. Individual beads retained by permalloy (NiFe81/19) microarray were used to capture biomarkers and facilitate the fluorescence identification. A numerical study indicates that the magnetic force keeping a bead in the trap is proportional to the thickness of the permalloy array and the external magnetic field strength, while inversely proportional to the size of the trap. The acoustic microstreaming activated by a piezo transducer was applied to generate fast-switching flow patterns to minimize the diffusion length scales. The flow at various driving frequencies was experimentally tested to achieve the optimal mixing effect. The flow field of the microstreaming was subsequently described by a mathematical model to understand the flow further. Finally, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were employed as model analytes to demonstrate the capability of the platform for rapid biomarker detection. With the aid of acoustic micromixing, the detection can be finished in 20 minutes. The respective limit of detection of PSA and CEA is 0.028 ng mL-1 (0.8 pM) and 3.1 ng mL-1 (17 pM), which is respectively 1/142 and 1/3 of the cutoff value of PSA and CEA.

Autophagy has appeared as a fundamental repair mechanism for degrading damaged organelles and proteins. It was clear that autophagy gene polymorphisms are correlated with development of inflammatory bowel disease and it can also be related with prostate cancer (PCa) or bladder cancer (BCa). In this study, we aimed to determine if ATG16L1 (Thr300Ala) polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of developing PCa and BCa and to establish correlations between ATG16L1 genotypes and morphological parameters. Methods: This study included 269 healthy controls and 131 patients (62 PCa and 69 BCa) with PCa and BCa.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 173 LAR and APR specimens in this study. Patients were evaluated in the Istanbul Ekin Private Pathology Laboratory and underwent surgery at Çanakkale State Hospital, General Surgery Clinic. RESULTS Of the 173 specimens, 15 (8.7%) were APR and 158 (91.3%) were LAR specimens. Ninety-four patients (54.3%) were males and 79 patients (45.7%) were females. The mean age of the patients was 63.5 years (range 26-90 years). In the histopathological examination, malignant neoplasm was detected in 172 of the cases (99.4%) and benign endometriosis was detected in 1 of the cases (0.6%).

Methods:   The expression level of PPP5C was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and ONCOM-INE datasets. Lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was constructed to silence the expression of PPP5C in prostate cancer cell. Cell viability and proliferation were measured using MTT and colony formation, and the cell cycle and apoptosis was analyszed by flow cytometry. The changes of downstream protein level and protein phosphorylation level were detected by western blot.  Results:   PPP5C was highly expressed in PCa tissue as analyzed by immunohistochemistry and ONCOMINE datasets. PPP5C Knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in PCa cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that DU145, PC3 and 22RV1 PCa cells deprived of PPP5C were arrested in G0/G1 phase and became apoptotic.

Here we investigated the correlation between the Gleason score (GS) and the TME by comparing tissue expression profiles of steroid hormone receptors, cancer activated fibroblast (CAF) markers and vessel densities between different GS groups. Therefore, matched patient cohorts were composed for different GS (6-7-8). Tissue micro-arrays with 6 samples/patient were processed for immunohistochemistry. Stained slides were digitised, stroma and epithelium were selectively annotated, and all selected areas were quantitatively analysed for marker expression.

The mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon is currently unclear; however, IL6 has pleiotropic effects on a number of signaling pathways, including the androgen receptor (AR). Therefore, we investigated IL6-mediated AR activation in prostate cancer cell lines and ex vivo primary prostate tissue cultures in order to gain a better understanding on how to inhibit this process for future clinical trials. IL6 significantly increased androgen-dependent AR activity in LNCaP cells but importantly did not influence AR activity at castrate androgen levels. To identify the underlying mechanism, we investigated several signaling pathways but only found IL6-dependent changes in STAT3 signaling. Biochemical inhibition of STAT3 with the small-molecule inhibitor galiellalactone significantly reduced AR activity in several prostate and breast cancer cell lines. We confirmed the efficacy of galiellalactone in primary tissue slice cultures from radical prostatectomy samples. Galiellalactone significantly reduced the expression of the AR target genes PSA (P < 0.001), TMPRSS2 (P < 0.001), and FKBP5 (P = 0.003) in benign tissue cultures (n = 24). However, a high heterogeneity in the response of the malignant samples was discovered, and only a subset of tissue samples (4 out of 10) had decreased PSA expression upon galiellalactone treatment. Taken together, this finding demonstrates that targeting the IL6/STAT3 pathway with galiellalactone is a viable option to decrease AR activity in prostate tissue that may be applied in a personalized medicine approach.""","""['Florian Handle', 'Martin Puhr', 'Georg Schaefer', 'Nicla Lorito', 'Julia Hoefer', 'Martina Gruber', 'Fabian Guggenberger', 'Frédéric R Santer', 'Rute B Marques', 'Wytske M van Weerden', 'Frank Claessens', 'Holger H H Erb', 'Zoran Culig']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['The STAT3 inhibitor galiellalactone inhibits the generation of MDSC-like monocytes by prostate cancer cells and decreases immunosuppressive and tumorigenic factors.', 'Galiellalactone inhibits the STAT3/AR signaling axis and suppresses Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The STAT3 Inhibitor Galiellalactone Effectively Reduces Tumor Growth and Metastatic Spread in an Orthotopic Xenograft Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Role of IL-6 in Cancer Cell Invasiveness and Metastasis-Overview and Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Metabolic changes during prostate cancer development and progression.', 'Molecular Mechanisms and Current Treatment Options for Cancer Cachexia.', 'Harnessing the Utility of Ex Vivo Patient Prostate Tissue Slice Cultures.', 'Influence of Systemic Therapy on the Expression and Activity of Selected STAT Proteins in Prostate Cancer Tissue.']"""

The aims of this study were to evaluate STEAP1 expression in breast cancer and to determine the mechanisms involved.  Methods:   STEAP1 expression was compared in normal breast tissue (n = 40), benign fibroadenoma (n = 52), and primary breast cancer (n = 211) using immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunocytochemistry were used to evaluate STEAP1 expression in 3 breast cancer cell lines and in a normal mammary epithelial cell line. STEAP1 expression and its prognostic value in breast cancer were verified using the Oncomine and Kaplan-Meier Plotter databases. Transfection of cells to up-regulate or knock down STEAP1 expression was used to determine the effect of STEAP1 on cell invasion and proliferation, and to evaluate its relationship to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression.  Results:   STEAP1 expression was lower in breast cancers cells, and low expression was associated with a malignant phenotype and poor prognosis. Analysis of public databases supported our conclusions. Knockdown of STEAP1 expression enhanced cellular invasion and migration abilities, increased expression of EMT-related genes MMP2, MMP9, MMP13, VIM, and CDH2, and decreased CDH1 expression. Enhanced STEAP1 expression significantly inhibited cellular invasion and migration abilities, decreased expression of the EMT-related genes, and increased CDH1 expression. Up-regulation or knockdown of STEAP1 had little effect on cellular proliferation.  Conclusion:   STEAP1 was down-regulated in breast cancer, inhibited metastasis of breast cancer, and hampered the levels of EMT markers, which thus implicated STEAP1 in the suppression of EMT.""","""['Jie Xie', 'Yan Yang', 'Jiali Sun', 'Zhi Jiao', 'Haozheng Zhang', 'Jie Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Clin Breast Cancer""","""['STEAP2 is down-regulated in breast cancer tissue and suppresses PI3K/AKT signaling and breast cancer cell invasion in vitro and in vivo.', 'Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 expression promotes ovarian cancer metastasis by aiding progression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.', 'STEAP1 is over-expressed in breast cancer and down-regulated by 17beta-estradiol in MCF-7 cells and in the rat mammary gland.', 'Om.breast cancer in very young women aged 25 year-old or below in the center of Tunisia and review of the literature.', 'Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and invadopodia markers in breast cancer: Lumican a key regulator.', 'EFEMP1 binds to STEAP1 to promote osteosarcoma proliferation and invasion via the Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β/Smad2/3 signal pathways.', 'Molecular characterization of renal cell carcinoma tumors from a phase III anti-angiogenic adjuvant therapy trial.', 'Expression and prognostic analyses of the significance of STEAP1 and STEAP2 in lung cancer.', 'DNA Methylation Mediates EMT Gene Expression in Human Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines.', 'Regulatory Roles of Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate Family Members in the Occurrence and Development of Malignant Tumors.']"""

To do so, we compared the outcome for men in the radical prostatectomy (RP) arm of the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study number 4 (SPCG-4) randomised trial with matched men treated in a contemporary era before and after compensation for the grade migration and grade inflation that have occurred since the 1980s.  Patients and methods:   A propensity score-matched analysis of prostate cancer mortality and all-cause mortality in the SPCG-4 and matched men in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden treated in 1998-2006 was conducted. Cumulative incidence of prostate cancer mortality and all-cause mortality was calculated. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a matching on original Gleason Grade Groups (GGG) and second, matching with GGG increased one unit for men in the NPCR.  Results:   Matched men in the NPCR treated in 2005-2006 had half the risk of prostate cancer mortality compared to men in the SPCG-4 (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.19-1.14). In analysis of men matched on an upgraded GGG in the NPCR, this difference was mitigated (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.36-1.47).  Conclusions:   Outcomes after RP for men in the SPCG-4 cannot be directly applied to men in the current era, mainly due to grade inflation and grade migration. However, by compensating for changes in grading, similar outcomes after RP were seen in the SPCG-4 and NPCR.

Clinical guidelines support multimodal approaches, which include radical prostatectomy (RP) followed by radiotherapy (XRT) and XRT plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, this study compared survival outcomes and adverse effects associated with RP plus XRT versus XRT plus ADT in these men.  Methods:   SEER-Medicare data were queried for men with cT3-T4N0M0 (LAPCa) or cT3-T4N1M0 (RAPCa) prostate cancer. Propensity score methods were used to balance cohort characteristics between the treatment arms. Survival analyses were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   From 1992 to 2009, 13,856 men (≥65 years old) were diagnosed with LAPCa or RAPCa: 6.1% received RP plus XRT, and 23.6% received XRT plus ADT. At a median follow-up of 14.6 years, there were 2189 deaths in the cohort, of which 702 were secondary to prostate cancer. Regardless of the tumor stage or the Gleason score, the adjusted 10-year prostate cancer-specific survival and 10-year overall survival favored men who underwent RP plus XRT over men who underwent XRT plus ADT. However, RP plus XRT versus XRT plus ADT was associated with higher rates of erectile dysfunction (28% vs 20%; P = .0212) and urinary incontinence (49% vs 19%; P < .001).

PSMA-617 and HTK01169 that contained N-[4-( p-iodophenyl)butanoyl]-Glu as an albumin-binding motif were synthesized using the solid-phase approach. Binding affinity to PSMA was determined by in vitro competition-binding assay. 177Lu labeling was performed in acetate buffer (pH 4.5) at 90 °C for 15 min. SPECT/CT imaging, biodistribution, and endoradiotherapy studies were conducted in mice bearing PSMA-expressing LNCaP tumor xenografts. Radiation dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA software. Lu-PSMA-617 and Lu-HTK01169-bound PSMA with high affinity ( Ki values = 0.24 and 0.04 nM, respectively). SPECT imaging and biodistribution studies showed that 177Lu-PSMA-617 and 177Lu-HTK01169 were excreted mainly via the renal pathway. With fast blood clearance (0.68%ID/g at 1 h postinjection), the tumor uptake of 177Lu-PSMA-617 peaked at 1 h postinjection (15.1%ID/g) and gradually decreased to 7.91%ID/g at 120 h postinjection. With extended blood retention (16.6 and 2.10%ID/g at 1 and 24 h, respectively), the tumor uptake of 177Lu-HTK01169 peaked at 24 h postinjection (55.9%ID/g) and remained at the same level by the end of the study (120 h). Based on dosimetry calculations, 177Lu-HTK01169 delivered an 8.3-fold higher radiation dose than 177Lu-PSMA-617 to LNCaP tumor xenografts. For the endoradiotherapy study, the mice treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 (18.5 MBq) all reached humane end point (tumor volume >1000 mm3) by Day 73 with a median survival of 58 days. Mice treated with 18.5, 9.3, 4.6, or 2.3 MBq of 177Lu-HTK01169 had a median survival of >120, 103, 61, and 28 days, respectively. With greatly enhanced tumor uptake and treatment efficacy compared to 177Lu-PSMA-617 in preclinical studies, 177Lu-HTK01169 warrants further investigation for endoradiotherapy of prostate cancer.""","""['Hsiou-Ting Kuo', 'Helen Merkens', 'Zhengxing Zhang', 'Carlos F Uribe', 'Joseph Lau', 'Chengcheng Zhang', 'Nadine Colpo', 'Kuo-Shyan Lin', 'François Bénard']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['177Lu-Labeled Albumin-Binder-Conjugated PSMA-Targeting Agents with Extremely High Tumor Uptake and Enhanced Tumor-to-Kidney Absorbed Dose Ratio.', 'Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Optimization of the Tissue Distribution Profile.', 'Preclinical Development of Novel PSMA-Targeting Radioligands: Modulation of Albumin-Binding Properties To Improve Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'The Rise of PSMA Ligands for Diagnosis and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen theranostics: therapy with lutetium-177.', 'Synthesis and Evaluation of 99mTc-Labeled PSMA-Targeted Tracers Based on the Lys-Urea-Aad Pharmacophore for Detecting Prostate Cancer with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography.', 'Development of 177LuLu-LNC1003 for radioligand therapy of prostate cancer with a moderate level of PSMA expression.', 'Synthesis and radiolabelling of PSMA-targeted derivatives containing GYK/MVK cleavable linkers.', 'Theranostic 64Cu-DOTHA2-PSMA allows low toxicity radioligand therapy in mice prostate cancer model.', 'Modulating the pharmacokinetic profile of Actinium-225-labeled macropa-derived radioconjugates by dual targeting of PSMA and albumin.']"""

However, little is known about the effect of TGZ on metastasis in prostate cancer. The aim of the present study was to determine the inhibitory effect and mechanism underlying TGZ on cell growth, migration and invasion using the prostate cancer PC-3 cell line. Cellular migration and invasion were evaluated by performing a wound healing assay and Matrigel assay, respectively. The expression levels of mRNA and protein were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results demonstrated that TGZ dose-dependently inhibited cell migration and invasion of PC-3 cells. The present study also revealed that TGZ increased the mRNA and protein levels of E-cadherin and glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. In addition, GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist, attenuated the increased mRNA and protein levels of E-cadherin and GPx3, suggesting that the PPARγ-dependent signaling pathway was involved. Taken together, these results suggested that the anti-migration and anti-invasion effect of TGZ on PC-3 prostate cancer cells is, at least in part, mediated via upregulation of E-cadherin and GPx3.

Reactive stroma was evaluated using histopathology from 108 fresh frozen prostate cancer samples gathered from 43 patients after prostatectomy (Biobank1). A subset of the samples was analyzed both for metabolic (n = 85) and transcriptomic alterations (n = 78) using high resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HR-MAS MRS) and RNA microarray, respectively. Recurrence-free survival was assessed in patients with clinical follow-up of minimum five years (n = 38) using biochemical recurrence (BCR) as endpoint. Multivariate metabolomics and gene expression analysis compared low (≤15%) against high reactive stroma content (≥16%). High reactive stroma content was associated with BCR in prostate cancer patients even when accounting for the influence of Grade Group (Cox hazard proportional analysis, p = 0.013). In samples with high reactive stroma content, metabolites and genes linked to immune functions and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling were significantly upregulated. Future validation of these findings is important to reveal novel biomarkers and drug targets connected to immune mechanisms and ECM in prostate cancer.

It is unclear how age at diagnosis influences the risk of SPMs.  Materials and methods:   Using the 1973 to 2013 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, we studied the impact of age on SPMs (defined as a bladder or rectal tumor) after localized CaP treatment with radical prostatectomy (RP) or RT. SPM risk was compared using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted cumulative incidence function and competing-risk proportional hazard models. Overall survival (OS) in patients with SPM was compared using Kaplan Meier and Cox regression analyses.  Results:   A total of 579,608 patients met inclusion criteria, and 51.8% of the cohort was treated with RT. The 10- and 20-year cumulative incidences of competing risk (IPTW adjusted) of SPMs were 1.9% (95%CI = 1.8-1.9%) and 3.6% (95%CI = 3.4-3.7%) after RP vs. 2.7% (95%CI = 2.6-2.8%) and 5.4%(95%CI = 5.3-5.6%) after RT. IPTW-adjusted competing risk hazard ratio (HR) of SPM after RT compared to RP was increased in the entire cohort (HR 1.46; 95%CI = 1.39-1.53, P < 0.001) and was highest in the youngest patients: Age <55 HR = 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49-2.24, P<0.001), Age 55 to 64 HR = 1.66 (95%CI = 1.54-1.79, P < 0.001), Age 65-74 HR = 1.41 (95%CI = 1.33-1.48, P < 0.001), Age ≥75 HR = 1.14 (95%CI = 0.97-1.35, P = 0.112). At 10 years, SPM-specific mortality occurred in 28.9% of patients treated with RT, though OS with SPM was worse in the youngest patients: Age <55 HR = 1.88 (95%CI = 1.25-2.81, P = 0.002), Age 55-64 HR = 1.60 (95%CI = 1.42-1.81, P < 0.001), Age 65-74 HR = 1.40 (95%CI = 1.30-1.52, P < 0.001), Age ≥ 75 HR = 1.27 (95%CI = 1.06-1.53, P = 0.009). All of the age categories had similar median follow-up times.  Conclusion:   At 10 years there is a 1.8% increased incidence of SPM after RT compared to RP, of which <30% of RT-treated patients with an SPM die as a result of a SPM. However, the risk of SPMs was greatest among younger men treated with RT for localized CaP, and this relationship could not be explained solely by follow-up time, latency time, or life expectancy.

Methods:   We searched the PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, CBM, CNKI and Wanfang databases, the cited references were also manually searched again, covering all the papers published until August 2018. Quality assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. All the meta-analysis was conducted with Stata version 12.0 software to assess the strength of the association.

The gene expression microarray of LTL-313H and LTL-313B, which derived from a single PCa patient, was performed to identify the candidate biomarker gene, TMRM45B. MSKCC and TCGA PCa patient cohorts were introduced to analyzed the clinical significance of TMEM45B expression. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that there was a significant increase of TMEM45B expression in high metastatic potential tumor lines LTL-313H and LTL-331 compared with the other two low metastatic potential tumor lines(LTL-418, LTL-313B). In MSKCC PCa cohort, the mRNA level of TMEM45B in patients with metastasis was significantly higher than that in primary PCa (P=0.001) and begin prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients (P<0.001). In addition, the increased TMEM45B expression was positively related with a higher possibility of biochemical recurrence (P=0.016), distant metastasis occurrence(P<0.001) and overall patient survival (P=0.07). Moreover, TMEM45B expression was considered as an independent risk factor for metastasis of PCa based on multivariate logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with elevated TMEM45B had a shorter biochemical recurrence free survival (RFS). For primary PCa patients, subgroup analysis showed that there was a significant association between TMEM45B expression and clinical features in primary PCa cohort. Meanwhile, cases with elevated TMEM45B were more likely to develop metastasis compared to the normal group among N0 primary PCa patients (P=0.010). Primary PCa patient cohort TCGA was used to validate the results, and an obvious relationship was found between TMEM45B and clinical characteristic of PCa (T/N stage, Gleason score, Recurrence / Progress). Furthermore, a significant poor disease free survival (DFS) was investigated in high-level of TMEM45B patients compared with the other remaining cases (P=0.007). Taken together, the increased expression of TMEM45B appears to be significantly associated with prostate carcinoma progression and metastasis which provide a new prognostic biomarker for predicting metastatic potential of PCa patients, especially for primary PCa.""","""['F Luo', 'K Yang', 'Y Z Wang', 'D Lin']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Neoplasma""","""['A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'Decreased expression of serine protease inhibitor family G1 (SERPING1) in prostate cancer can help distinguish high-risk prostate cancer and predicts malignant progression.', 'Down-regulation of protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide attenuates tumor progression and is an independent prognostic predictor of survival in prostate cancer.', 'The association of CXCR4 expression with clinicopathological significance and potential drug target in prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review.', 'Integrin Expression in Localized Prostate Cancer: A TCGA and MSKCC Cohort-based Exploratory In Silico Analysis.', 'TMEΜ45B Interacts with Sindbis Virus Nsp1 and Nsp4 and Inhibits Viral Replication.', 'Differential Expression of a Panel of Ten CNTN1-Associated Genes during Prostate Cancer Progression and the Predictive Properties of the Panel Towards Prostate Cancer Relapse.', 'Application of Prostate Cancer Models for Preclinical Study: Advantages and Limitations of Cell Lines, Patient-Derived Xenografts, and Three-Dimensional Culture of Patient-Derived Cells.']"""

Given the potential role of AR/AR-V7 in SDC treatment, this study focuses on AR/AR-V7 expression in SDC specimens collected before androgen-deprivation therapy. RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect total AR and AR-V7 were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded SDC specimens from 23 patients. Full-length AR and AR-V7 transcripts were quantified in a subset of tumors by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Twenty SDCs were positive for total AR by ISH and IHC. Among AR-positive SDCs, 70% (14/20) were positive for AR-V7 messenger RNA by ISH, whereas 15% (3/20) were positive for AR-V7 protein by IHC. The 3 SDCs that expressed the highest levels of AR-V7 were all from female patients; one of them expressed a significant amount of AR-V7 and barely detectable full-length AR transcripts by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. IHC expression of Forkhead box protein A1, prostate-specific antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase, and NKX3.1 was observed in some SDCs regardless of patient sex. Five SDCs demonstrated strong human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression. We conclude that treatment-naïve SDCs may express AR-V7 at levels comparable to or even exceeding the levels detected in castration-resistant prostate cancer.

PCa expresses antigens that could be recognized by the immune system. We therefore hypothesized that stereotactic dose escalation to the DIN is safe, may increase local control, and may initiate tumor-specific immune responses.  Patients and methods:   Patients with localized PCa were treated with stereotactic extreme hypofractionated doses of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions to the whole prostate while simultaneously escalating doses to the magnetic resonance image-visible DIN (45 Gy, 47.5 Gy, and 50 Gy in 5 fractions). The phase 1a part was designed to determine the recommended phase 1b dose in a ""3 + 3"" cohort-based, dose-escalation design. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicities defined as ≥grade 3 gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicity (or both) by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4) up to 90 days after the first radiation fraction. The secondary endpoints were prostate-specific antigen kinetics, quality of life (QoL), and blood immunologic responses.  Results:   Nine patients were treated in phase 1a. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at either level, and therefore the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Further characterization of tolerability, efficacy, and immunologic outcomes was conducted in the subsequent 11 patients irradiated at the highest dose level (50 Gy) in the phase 1b expansion cohort. Toxicity was 45% and 25% for grades 1 and 2 GU, and 20% and 5% for grades 1 and 2 GI, respectively. No grade 3 or worse toxicity was reported. The average (±standard error of the mean) of the QoL assessments at baseline and at 3-month posttreatment were 0.8 (±0.8) and 3.5 (±1.5) for the bowel (mean difference, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-5), and 6.4 (±0.8) and 7.27 (±0.9) for the International Prostate Symptom Score (mean difference, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.9), respectively. A subset of patients developed antigen-specific immune responses against prostate-specific membrane antigen (n = 2), prostatic acid phosphatase (n = 1), prostate stem cell antigen (n = 4), and prostate-specific antigen (n = 2).  Conclusions:   Irradiation of the whole prostate with 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions and dose escalation to 50 Gy to the DIN was tolerable and determined as the recommended phase 1b dose. This treatment has promising antitumor activity, which will be confirmed by the ongoing phase 2 part. Preliminary QoL analysis showed minimal impact in GU, GI, and sexual domains.

The reference CPRs were calculated according to reference prostate contours determined by radiation oncologists. Five anatomical feature points were manually determined on a prostate, bladder, and rectum in a sagittal plane of a planning computed tomography image for each case.

Thus, a deeper understanding of the patho-molecular mechanisms underlying the disease progression in PCA is crucial to identify novel diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets to improve the outcome of patients. Recent evidence suggests that activation of Wnt signaling in cancer stem cells (CSCs) contributes to cancer progression in malignant tumors. Here, we report that a novel Wnt co-activator ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated) maintains the prostate CSC subpopulation by augmenting the Wnt-β-catenin signaling in PCA. ASPM expression is incrementally upregulated in primary and metastatic PCA, implicating its potential role in PCA progression. Consistently, downregulation of ASPM expression pronouncedly attenuated the proliferation, colony formation, and the invasive behavior of PCA cells, and dramatically reduced the number of ALDH+ CSCs and inhibited cancer stemness and tumorigenicity. Mechanistically, ASPM interacts with disheveled-3 (Dvl-3), a cardinal upstream regulator of canonical Wnt signaling, and inhibits its proteasome-dependent degradation, thereby increasing its protein stability and enabling the Wnt-induced β-catenin transcriptional activity in PCA cells. In keeping with the role of ASPM as a CSC-regulator, ASPM co-localizes with ALDH in PCA tissues and its expression exhibits high intra-tumoral heterogeneity. The proportion of high-ASPM-expressing cells in the tumor inversely correlates with the relapse-free survival of PCA patients. Collectively, our data points to ASPM as a novel oncoprotein and an essential regulator of Wnt signaling and cancer stemness in PCA, which has important clinical and therapeutic significance.""","""['Vincent C Pai#', 'Chung-Chi Hsu#', 'Tze-Sian Chan', 'Wen-Ying Liao', 'Chih-Pin Chuu', 'Wei-Yu Chen', 'Chi-Rong Li', 'Ching-Yu Lin', 'Shu-Pin Huang', 'Li-Tzong Chen', 'Kelvin K Tsai']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Correction: ASPM promotes prostate cancer stemness and progression by augmenting Wnt-Dvl-3-β-catenin signaling.', 'The differential distributions of ASPM isoforms and their roles in Wnt signaling, cell cycle progression, and pancreatic cancer prognosis.', 'Radiation-induced glucocorticoid receptor promotes CD44+ prostate cancer stem cell growth through activation of SGK1-Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'ASPM promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling through antagonizing autophagy-mediated Dvl2 degradation.', 'Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway in Skin Carcinogenesis and Therapy.', 'Cancer Stem Cells and Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'Bioinformatics Approach to Identify the Influences of COVID-19 on Ischemic Stroke.', 'Disheveled3 enhanced EMT and cancer stem-like cells properties via Wnt/β-catenin/c-Myc/SOX2 pathway in colorectal cancer.', 'Identification and validation of novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for non-small cell lung cancer.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Differentially expressed discriminative genes and significant meta-hub genes based key genes identification for hepatocellular carcinoma using statistical machine learning.']"""

Previous studies have found that RNA binding protein Lin28A is a key factor of maintain the pluripotency of stem cells, and it is positively correlated with the degree of several cancers (breast, prostate, liver cancer, etc). Our previous study shows that Lin28A is highly expressed in OC tissues and is involved in the regulation of OC cell biological behavior. In this study, we confirmed that high expression of Lin28A promoted the survival, invasion, metastasis, and inhibited the apoptosis of OC cells. Lin28A interacts with Rho associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase2 (ROCK2) but not ROCK1 and upregulates the expression of ROCK2 in OC cells. The binding sites of each other were identified by truncated mutations and Immuno-precipitaion (IP) assay. After knock down of ROCK2 in cells with high expression of Lin28A, the survival, invasion, metastasis was significantly inhibited and early apoptosis was increased in OC cells and OC xenograft in nude mice. Our experimental data also showed that knock down of ROCK2 but not ROCK1 inhibited the invasion by decreasing the expression of N-cadherin, Slug, β-catenin and increasing ZO-1 expression. Simultaneously, knock down of ROCK2 induced cell apoptosis by increasing cleaved Caspase-9,cleaved Caspase-7, and cleaved Caspase-3.

We find that cancer initiation in aged Nkx3.1 mutant mice correlates with enrichment of specific immune populations and increased expression of immunoregulatory genes. Furthermore, expression of these immunoregulatory genes is similarly increased in human prostate tumors having low levels of NKX3.1 expression. We further show that induction of prostatitis in Nkx3.1 mutant mice accelerates prostate cancer initiation, which is coincident with aberrant cellular plasticity and differentiation. Correspondingly, human prostate tumors having low levels of NKX3.1 have de-regulated expression of genes associated with these cellular processes.

The impact of αvβ3 integrin on the radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells and the molecular mechanism controlling cell survival in response to ionizing radiation (IR) was investigated. Both LNCaP cells stably transfected with αvβ3 integrin and PC-3 cells that contain endogenous β3 integrin were used. This study demonstrated that αvβ3 integrin increases survival of αvβ3-LNCaP cells upon IR while small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of αvβ3 integrin in PC-3 cells sensitizes to radiation. Expression of αvβ3 integrin in LNCaP cells also enhances anchorage-independent cell growth while knockdown of αvβ3 integrin in PC-3 cells inhibits anchorage-independent cell growth. The αvβ3 antagonist, cRGD, significantly increases radiosensitivity in both αvβ3-LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Moreover, αvβ3 integrin prevents radiation-induced downregulation of survivin. Inhibition of survivin expression by siRNA or shRNA enhances IR-induced inhibition of anchorage-independent cell growth. Overexpression of wild-type survivin in PC-3 cells treated with αvβ3 integrin shRNA increases survival of cells upon IR. These findings reveal that αvβ3 integrin promotes radioresistance and regulates survivin levels in response to IR.

Materials and methods:   A total of 997 biopsy naïve patients underwent transrectal prostate biopsy alone to June 2016 (cohort 1) and thereafter 792 underwent transrectal prostate biopsy following prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (cohort 2). Patients with lesions on prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging underwent cognitive targeted plus systematic transrectal prostate biopsy. Patients without lesions underwent systematic transrectal prostate biopsy.  Results:   Cohort 2 comprised younger men (age 68 vs 69 years, p = 0.01) with lower prostate specific antigen (7.6 vs 7.9 ng/ml, p = 0.024) and smaller prostate volume (56.1 vs 62 cc, p = 0.006). In cohort 2 vs cohort 1 there was no increase in overall prostate cancer detection (57.6% vs 56.7%, p = 0.701), the Gleason Grade Group or the number of positive cores (each p >0.05). Increased multifocal prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, maximum prostate cancer core length (5 mm or greater vs less than 5 mm) and radical surgery/high intensity focused ultrasound (each p <0.05) were observed in cohort 2. For Gleason Grade Group 2-5 prostate cancer negative prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging had 88.1% sensitivity, 59.8% specificity, 67.8% positive predictive value and 84% negative predictive value. For negative prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance images a prostate specific antigen density cutoff of 0.15 ng/ml2 or greater increased clinically significant prostate cancer detection only if the latter was defined as Gleason Grade Group 3-5 disease and/or tumor length 6 mm or greater.  Conclusions:   Introducing prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in our clinical setting increased the diagnostic yield of prostate cancer per biopsy core.

In this study, we found that CPT enhanced c-Myc expression and that the transient knockdown of c-Myc abrogated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which resulted in the accumulation of ER stress-regulating proteins, such as PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP. Moreover, the transfection of eIF2α-targeted siRNA attenuated CPT-induced autophagy and decreased the levels of Beclin-1 and Atg7, which indicated that CPT upregulated ER stress-mediated autophagy. In addition, CPT phosphorylated AMPK in response to intracellular Ca2+ release. Ca2+ chelators, ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid and a CaMKII inhibitor, K252a, decreased CPT-induced Beclin-1 and Atg7, and downregulated AMPK phosphorylation, which suggested that CPT-induced Ca2+ release leads to the activation of autophagy through CaMKII-mediated AMPK phosphorylation. CPT also phosphorylated JNK and activated the DNA-binding activity of AP-1; furthermore, knockdown of JNK abolished the expression level of Beclin-1 and Atg7, which implied that the JNK-AP-1 pathway was a potent mediator of CPT-induced autophagy.

Retrospective studies suggest a survival benefit for treatment of the primary prostatic tumour in mPCa, but to date, no randomised-controlled-trials (RCTs) have been published addressing this issue.  Objective:   To determine whether overall survival is prolonged by adding local treatment of the primary prostatic tumour with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to ADT.  Design, setting, and participants:   The HORRAD trial is a multicentre RCT recruiting 432 patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >20ng/ml and primary bone mPCa on bone scan between 2004 and 2014.  Intervention:   Patients were randomised to either ADT with EBRT (radiotherapy group) or ADT alone (control group).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoint was time to PSA progression. Crude and adjusted analyses were applied to evaluate treatment effect.  Results and limitations:   Median PSA level was 142ng/ml and 67% of patients had more than five osseous metastases. Median follow up was 47 mo. Median overall survival was 45 mo (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.4-49.6) in the radiotherapy group and 43 mo (95% CI: 32.6-53.4) in the control group (p=0.4). No significant difference was found in overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.70-1.14; p=0.4). Median time to PSA progression in the radiotherapy group was 15 mo (95% CI: 11.8-18.2), compared with 12 mo (95% CI: 10.6-13.4) in the control group. The crude HR (0.78; 95% CI: 0.63-0.97) was statistically significant (p=0.02).  Conclusions:   The current RCT comparing ADT to ADT with EBRT to the prostate in patients with primary bone mPCa did not show a significant difference in overall survival, although the CI cannot exclude a substantial survival benefit.

Recent evidence suggests that metformin prevents and controls certain but not all types of cancer. The beneficial use of metformin in combination with some chemotherapeutic agents has been reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of metformin on DOX-induced effects in human prostate DU145 cancer cells and clarify its molecular mechanisms. For this purpose, DU145 cells were treated with DOX or metformin, either alone or in combination with each other. The proliferation of DU145 cells was inhibited by DOX-alone and metformin-alone treatment in a time and dose-dependent manner. Metformin could enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX by increasing DOX cellular uptake and cell cycle arrest at G1/S checkpoint which is associated with the enhancement of p21 protein expression. Moreover, metformin could elevate DOX-induced apoptosis in DU145 cells in a concentration-dependent manner and DOX-induced caspase-3 activity. These findings suggest that the combined treatment of metformin with DOX potentiates the anticancer efficacy of DOX in DU145 cells via inhibiting ABCB1 function, cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition and apoptosis induction.""","""['Maryam Hoseini Shafa', 'Razieh Jalal', 'Negin Kosari', 'Farzad Rahmani']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Regul Toxicol Pharmacol""","""['Algerian Propolis Potentiates Doxorubicin Mediated Anticancer Effect Against Human Pancreatic PANC-1 Cancer Cell Line through Cell Cycle Arrest, Apoptosis Induction and P-Glycoprotein Inhibition.', 'Reversing Multidrug Resistance in Chemo-resistant Human Lung Adenocarcinoma (A549/DOX) Cells by Algerian Propolis Through Direct Inhibiting the P-gp Efflux-pump, G0/G1 Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis Induction.', 'Targeting P-glycoprotein function, p53 and energy metabolism: Combination of metformin and 2-deoxyglucose reverses the multidrug resistance of MCF-7/Dox cells to doxorubicin.', 'Application of Lectin from Catfish Eggs to Cancer Therapy: A Fundamental Study.', 'Resveratrol Augments Doxorubicin and Cisplatin Chemotherapy: A Novel Therapeutic Strategy.', 'Co-delivery of doxorubicin and conferone by novel pH-responsive β-cyclodextrin grafted micelles triggers apoptosis of metastatic human breast cancer cells.', 'Metformin alters therapeutic effects in the BALB/c tumor therapy model.', 'In Vitro Study of Two Edible Polygonoideae Plants: Phenolic Profile, Cytotoxicity, and Modulation of Keap1-Nrf2 Gene Expression.', 'Metformin Restores the Drug Sensitivity of MCF-7 Cells Resistant Derivates via the Cooperative Modulation of Growth and Apoptotic-Related Pathways.', 'Effect of Metformin on Doxorubicin-Induced Memory Dysfunction.']"""

Objective:   To assess the rates of guideline implementation regarding NU with BCE relative to NU without BCE in patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and to test the effect of BCE on cancer-specific (CSM) and other-cause mortality (OCM).  Design, setting, and participants:   We relied on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2014) for UTUC of the renal pelvis patients (T1-T3, N0, M0) treated with NU with or without BCE.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cumulative incidence plots relying on competing-risks methodology illustrated 5-yr CSM and OCM rates. Multivariable competing-risks regression (MCRR) models tested the effect of BCE versus no BCE at NU.  Results and limitations:   Of 4266 assessable patients, 2913 (68.3%) underwent NU with BCE. Between 2004 and 2014, rates of BCE at NU increased from 63.0% to 74.5% (European Association for Palliative Care: 2%; p<0.001). At 60 mo, CSM rates were 19.7% versus 23.5% (p=0.005) in NU with BCE versus NU without BCE patients, respectively. In MCRR models, no difference in CSM was recorded according to BCE at NU (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.88, confidence interval [CI]: 0.75-1.03, p=0.1). Finally, OCM was unaffected by BCE at NU (HR: 0.94, CI: 0.77-1.15, p=0.5). This study is retrospective.  Conclusions:   According to guideline recommendation, the rates of NU with BCE increased over time. However, BCE status does not appear to affect CSM or OCM. Thus, our study was unable to examine the rates of urothelial cancer recurrence or metastatic progression according to BCE status.

Its dysfunction is known to play a role in different tumors. Among others, BRCA1 germline mutations account for higher risk and more aggressive course of prostate cancer (PCa). In addition, somatic BRCA1 gene loss was demonstrated to be a signature of PCa dissemination to lymph nodes and peripheral blood, and indicate worse clinical outcome. In order to substantiate the data for BRCA1 gene loss in PCa and reveal its phenotypical background, BRCA1 gene status was assessed in a large cohort of PCa patients and compared to different molecular factors. BRCA1 gene dosage was assessed in 2398 tumor samples from 1,199 PCa patients using fluorescent in situ hybridization. It was compared to clinico-pathological parameters, patients' outcome as well as selected proteins (Ki-67, apoptosis marker, cytokeratins, vimentin, E- and N-cadherin, ALDH1 and EGFR) examined immunohistochemically. BRCA1 losses were found in 10%, whereas gains appeared in 7% of 603 informative PCa patients. BRCA1 losses correlated to higher T stage (p = 0.027), Gleason score (p = 0.039), shorter time to biochemical recurrence in patients with Gleason score > 7 independently of other factors (multivariate analysis, p = 0.005) as well as expression of proteins regulating stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, that is, ALDH1 (p = 0.021) and EGFR (p = 0.011), respectively. BRCA1 gains correlated to shorter time to metastasis (p = 0.012) and expression of ALDH1 (p = 0.014). These results support the assumption that BRCA1 gene losses contribute to a progressive and stem cell-like phenotype of PCa.

Materials and methods:   This was a retrospective study of patients who had TRUS at UDUTH from December 2009 to November 2017. Relevant data were extracted from the procedure register, and case folders of the patients. Data analysis was performed using IPSS 20.0 version.  Results:   A total of 844 patients had the procedure within the period of the study. The mean age of the patients was 65.6 ± 10.6 years with a range of 7-98 years.

Patients with intermediate-risk, clinically localised disease are offered radical treatments such as surgery or radiotherapy, which can result in severe side effects. A number of alternative partial ablation (PA) technologies that may reduce treatment burden are available; however the comparative effectiveness of these techniques has never been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT).  Objectives:   To assess the feasibility of a RCT of PA using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) versus radical prostatectomy (RP) for intermediate-risk PCa and to test and optimise methods of data capture.  Design:   We carried out a prospective, multicentre, open-label feasibility study to inform the design and conduct of a future RCT, involving a QuinteT Recruitment Intervention (QRI) to understand barriers to participation.  Setting:   Five NHS hospitals in England.  Participants:   Men with unilateral, intermediate-risk, clinically localised PCa.  Interventions:   Radical prostatectomy compared with HIFU.  Primary outcome measure:   The randomisation of 80 men.  Secondary outcome measures:   Findings of the QRI and assessment of data capture methods.  Results:   Eighty-seven patients consented to participate by 31 March 2017 and 82 men were randomised by 4 May 2017 (41 men to the RP arm and 41 to the HIFU arm). The QRI was conducted in two iterative phases: phase I identified a number of barriers to recruitment, including organisational challenges, lack of recruiter equipoise and difficulties communicating with patients about the study, and phase II comprised the development and delivery of tailored strategies to optimise recruitment, including group training, individual feedback and 'tips' documents. At the time of data extraction, on 10 October 2017, treatment data were available for 71 patients. Patient characteristics were similar at baseline and the rate of return of all clinical case report forms (CRFs) was 95%; the return rate of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) questionnaire pack was 90.5%. Centres with specific long-standing expertise in offering HIFU as a routine NHS treatment option had lower recruitment rates (Basingstoke and Southampton) - with University College Hospital failing to enrol any participants - than centres offering HIFU in the trial context only.  Conclusions:   Randomisation of men to a RCT comparing PA with radical treatments of the prostate is feasible. The QRI provided insights into the complexities of recruiting to this surgical trial and has highlighted a number of key lessons that are likely to be important if the study progresses to a main trial. A full RCT comparing clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life outcomes between radical treatments and PA is now warranted.  Future work:   Men recruited to the feasibility study will be followed up for 36 months in accordance with the protocol. We will design a full RCT, taking into account the lessons learnt from this study. CRFs will be streamlined, and the length and frequency of PROMs and resource use diaries will be reviewed to reduce the burden on patients and research nurses and to optimise data completeness.

Material and methods:   A gel-phantom with two inserted GMs was scanned with CT and three different MR-scanners of 1.5 and 3 T (T2 TSE and T1 VIBE-Dixon, isotropic, voxel size 2 × 2 × 2 mm). After image fusion, deviations for fiducial and gel match were measured and artifacts were evaluated. Additionally, CT-MRI-match deviations and MRI-MRI-match deviations of 10 Patients from the M-basePro study using GMs were assessed.  Results:   GMs were visible in all imaging modalities. The outer gel contours were matched with <1 mm deviation, contour volumes varied between 0 and 1%. The deviations of the GMs were less than 2 mm in any direction of MRI/CT. Shifts of peripherally or centrally located GMs were randomly distributed. The average MRI-CT-match precision of 10 patients with GMs was 1.9 mm (range 1.1-3.1 mm).  Conclusions:   Match inaccuracies for GMs between reference CT and voxel-isotropic T2-TSE sequences are small. Spatial deviations of CT- and MR-contoured fiducials were less than 2 mm, i.e., below SLT of the applied modalities.

Chromosomal instability is another possible risk factor but this has not been adequately explained previously. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of PC patients have (1) an abnormally high level of chromosomal instability; (2) that they are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage; and (3) that these phenotypes are affected by hOGG1 (C1245G) polymorphism. These experiments were performed using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus Cytome (CBMN cyt) assay in PC cases and controls. We found that spontaneous or radiation-induced (3G) micronucleus (MN) frequency is not significantly different between both groups. However, spontaneous frequency of nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and radiation-induced nuclear buds (NBuds) were significantly higher in patients vs. controls (P < 0.0001; P = 0.0005, respectively). In addition, apoptosis and nuclear division index (NDI) was significantly higher in patients compared to controls after radiation treatment (P = 0.006; P = 0.0002, respectively). Furthermore carriage of at least one G allele of hOGG1 (C1245G) polymorphism was associated with a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) to have a base-line MN, NPB, or NBud frequency greater than medium level compared to homozygotes for C allele (OR:1.94, 1.77, 2.36, respectively, P = 0.02; 0.04, and 0.004, respectively). Our results support the hypotheses that those who develop PC have significantly higher level of genomic instability which is further increased in those who carry G allele of the hOGG1 (C1245G) polymorphism.

However, the effect of LPS on prostate cancer (PCa) cells metastasis has not been investigated in details. This study aimed to investigate the functional role of LPS on PCa cells metastasis and determine the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on this event.  Methods:   Two different PCa reporter cells lines (DU145-NF-κB-Luc and MAT-LyLu- NF-κB-Luc) were used to assess the direct effect of LPS on NF-κB activation in PCa cells. Plasma collected from LPS-stimulated human and rodent blood were used to check the indirect effect of LPS on NF-κB activation in PCa cells. Trans-well migration assay and two different orthotopic PCa animal models were used to investigate the effect of LPS on DU145 and MAT-LyLu cells migration or metastasis in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In all the studies DEX was used with or without LPS stimulation.  Results:   LPS and secretory factors present in plasma collected from LPS-stimulated blood, significantly activated NF-κB in DU145, and MAT-LyLu cells and enhanced their migration in vitro. DEX significantly suppressed LPS-mediated activation of cancer and blood cells and abrogated the direct and indirect pro-migratory effect of LPS on PCa cells. Systemic administration of LPS activated NF-κB in DU145 cells in vivo; however, failed to alter the metastatic properties of these cells. On the other hand, systemic administration of LPS to MAT-LyLu tumor bearing animals significantly enhanced the incidence of metastasis without altering the overall growth of primary tumors. Unexpectedly, though DEX significantly suppressed MAT-LyLu primary tumor weights, it aggravated metastasis of cancer cells in presence and absence of LPS.

Cancer resistance to androgen deprivation therapies ensues when tumors engage metabolic processes that produce sustained androgen levels in the tissue. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this resistance process are unclear, and functional imaging modalities that predict impending resistance are lacking. Here, using the human LNCaP and C4-2 cell line models of prostate cancer, we show that castration treatment-sensitive prostate cancer cells that normally have an intact glucuronidation pathway that rapidly conjugates and inactivates dihydrotestosterone and thereby limits androgen signaling, become glucuronidation deficient and resistant to androgen deprivation. Mechanistically, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene ablation, we found that loss of UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B15 (UGT2B15) and UGT2B17 is sufficient to restore free dihydrotestosterone, sustained androgen signaling, and development of castration resistance. Furthermore, loss of glucuronidation enzymatic activity was also detectable with a nonsteroid glucuronidation substrate. Of note, glucuronidation-incompetent cells and the resultant loss of intracellular conjugated dihydrotestosterone were detectable in vivo by 18F-dihydrotestosterone PET. Together, these findings couple a mechanism with a functional imaging modality to identify impending castration resistance in prostate cancers.""","""['Ziqi Zhu', 'Yoon-Mi Chung', 'Olga Sergeeva', 'Vladimir Kepe', 'Michael Berk', 'Jianneng Li', 'Hyun-Kyung Ko', 'Zhenfei Li', 'Marianne Petro', 'Frank P DiFilippo', 'Zhenghong Lee', 'Nima Sharifi']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Loss of exogenous androgen dependence by prostate tumor cells is associated with elevated glucuronidation potential.', 'Low β₂-adrenergic receptor level may promote development of castration resistant prostate cancer and altered steroid metabolism.', 'Classical and Non-Classical Roles for Pre-Receptor Control of DHT Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Multiple roles for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)2B15 and UGT2B17 enzymes in androgen metabolism and prostate cancer evolution.', 'Molecular biology of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblast-secreted glucosamine alters the androgen biosynthesis program in prostate cancer via HSD3B1 upregulation.', 'BMX controls 3βHSD1 and sex steroid biosynthesis in cancer.', '5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acid Controls Androgen Reduction in Diverse Types of Human Epithelial Cells.', 'Intracrine androgen biosynthesis and drug resistance.', 'Hypoxia-Reoxygenation Couples 3βHSD1 Enzyme and Cofactor Upregulation to Facilitate Androgen Biosynthesis and Hormone Therapy Resistance in Prostate Cancer.']"""

This article proposes a novel algorithm to identify epigenetically silenced TSGs (epi-TSGs) for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Our method is based on the perception that the promoter CpG island(s) of a typical epi-TSG has a stratified methylation profile over tumor samples. In other words, we assume that the methylation profile resembles the combination of a binary distribution of a driver mutation and a continuous distribution representing measurement noise and intratumor heterogeneity.  Results:   Applying the proposed algorithm and an existing method to The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate cancer data, we identify 57 candidate epi-TSGs. Over one third of these epi-TSGs have been reported to carry potential tumor suppression functions. The negative correlations between the expression levels and methylation levels of these genes are validated on external independent datasets. We further find that the expression profiling of these genes is a robust predictive signature for Gleason scores, with the AUC statistic ranging from 0.75 to 0.79. The identified signature also shows prediction strength for tumor progression stages, biochemical recurrences, and metastasis events.  Conclusions:   We propose a novel method for pinpointing candidate epi-TSGs in prostate cancer. The expression profiling of the identified epi-TSGs demonstrates significant prediction strength for tumor progression.  Impact:   The proposed epi-TSGs identification method can be adapted to other cancer types beyond prostate cancer. The identified clinically significant epi-TSGs would shed light on the carcinogenesis of prostate adenocarcinomas.""","""['Wensheng Zhang', 'Erik K Flemington', 'Hong-Wen Deng', 'Kun Zhang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Frequent silencing of the candidate tumor suppressor TRIM58 by promoter methylation in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Lactoferrin CpG Island Hypermethylation and Decoupling of mRNA and Protein Expression in the Early Stages of Prostate Carcinogenesis.', 'Bona Fide Tumor Suppressor Genes Hypermethylated in Melanoma: A Narrative Review.', 'Promoter CpG-Site Methylation of the KAI1 Metastasis Suppressor Gene Contributes to Its Epigenetic Repression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Deciphering the Increased Prevalence of TP53 Mutations in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic Drugs and Their Immune Modulating Potential in Cancers.']"""

Aspirin has been shown to decrease ovarian cancer risk, though the mechanism is unknown. Studies of inflammatory markers, lipid molecules such as arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and alpha-linoleic acid metabolites, and development of ovarian cancer are essential to understand the potential mechanisms.  Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study (157 cases/156 matched controls) within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association between prediagnostic serum levels of 31 arachidonic acid/linoleic acid/alpha-linoleic acid metabolites and risk of ovarian cancer.  Results:   Five of the 31 arachidonic acid/linoleic acid/alpha-linoleic acid (free fatty acids) metabolites were positively associated with ovarian cancer risk: 8-HETE [tertile 3 vs. 1: OR 2.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-5.39), P trend 0.02], 12,13-DHOME [2.49 (1.29-4.81), 0.01], 13-HODE [2.47 (1.32-4.60), 0.005], 9-HODE [1.97 (1.06-3.68), 0.03], 9,12,13-THOME [2.25 (1.20-4.21), 0.01].

The aim of this study was to investigate the functional importance of the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 4 in preclinical models of urothelial carcinoma and to assess its relevance in patient tumors. The association of MCT4 expression with molecular subtypes and outcome was determined in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort and two independent cohorts of patients with urothelial carcinoma. Silencing of MCT4 was performed using siRNAs in urothelial carcinoma cell lines. Effects of MCT4 inhibition on cell growth, apoptosis, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed. Moreover, effects on lactate efflux were determined. The in vivo effects of MCT4 silencing were assessed in an orthotopic xenograft model. MCT4 expression was higher in the basal subtype. Decreased MCT4 methylation and increased RNA and protein expression were associated with worse overall survival (OS). Inhibition of MCT4 led to a reduction in cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and an increased synthesis of ROS. MCT4 inhibition resulted in intracellular accumulation of lactate. In vivo, stable knockdown of MCT4 reduced tumor growth. The expression of MCT4 in urothelial carcinoma is associated with features of aggressive tumor biology and portends a poor prognosis.

They express the classical androgen receptor (AR) and ZIP9, a Zn2+ transporter that also binds testosterone and mediates signaling by interacting with G-proteins. Our results show that LNCaP cells respond to testosterone by mobilizing their migratory machinery. Their exposure to testosterone triggers the formation of lamellipodia, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr925 and of paxillin at Tyr118, expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), and cell migration. Silencing ZIP9 expression by means of siRNA does not affect the responsiveness of the classical AR to testosterone; however, it prevents all of the testosterone effects described above: formation of lamellipodia cannot be induced, stimulation of FAK or paxillin phosphorylation or MMP-2 expression is prevented, and cell migration does not take place in the absence of ZIP9. The data presented show that testosterone/ZIP9 interactions might have not only physiological but also pathophysiological relevance. The fact that the migratory machinery of a metastatic prostate cancer cell line is activated exclusively through testosterone/ZIP9 and not through testosterone/AR interactions suggests that targeting specific inhibition of testosterone/ZIP9-mediated events might help in developing new therapeutic strategies against androgen-induced progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Ahmed Bulldan', 'Joerg-Walter Bartsch', 'Lutz Konrad', 'Georgios Scheiner-Bobis']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res""","""['Membrane androgen receptor characteristics of human ZIP9 (SLC39A) zinc transporter in prostate cancer cells: Androgen-specific activation and involvement of an inhibitory G protein in zinc and MAP kinase signaling.', 'Identification and characterization of membrane androgen receptors in the ZIP9 zinc transporter subfamily: II.

We sought to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes between small (<60 cc) and large (≥60 cc) prostates treated with high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-B).  Methods and materials:   One hundred thirty patients at Emory University were treated with HDR-B monotherapy (n = 75) or HDR-B in combination with external beam radiation therapy (n = 55). American Urologic Association Symptom Score (AUASS) and expanded prostate cancer index composite for clinical practice (EPIC-CP) scores were recorded. A linear mixed model was performed dichotomizing prostate volume (<60 and ≥ 60 cc) with AUASS, individual EPIC-CP domains (urinary incontinence, urinary irritation/obstruction [UIO], bowel function, sexual function, and vitality/hormonal function), and overall EPIC-CP HRQOL scores.  Results:   Median followup was 22.6 months (range 2.2-55.8). The median gland volume for the entire cohort (n = 130), <60 cc cohort (n = 104), and ≥60 cc cohort (n = 26) was 44 cc, 41.1 cc, and 68.0 cc, respectively. There were no baseline differences in HRQOL scores between cohorts. At 2 months, AUASS and UIO scores increased similarly between cohorts (AUASS p = 0.807; UIO p = 0.539), then decreased (longitudinal effect p < 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively) to remain not significantly different at 12 months (AUASS p = 0.595; UIO p = 0.673). Overall, prostate volume was not significantly associated with change in AUASS (p = 0.403), urinary incontinence (p = 0.322), UIO symptoms (p = 0.779), bowel symptoms (p = 0.757), vitality/hormonal symptoms (p = 0.503), or overall HRQOL (p = 0.382).

A substantial proportion of these men with CaP are diagnosed at late (usually incurable) stages, yet little is known about the etiology of CaP in SSA.  Methods:   We established the Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate Network, which includes seven SSA centers partnering with five US centers to study the genetics and epidemiology of CaP in SSA. We developed common data elements and instruments, regulatory infrastructure, and biosample collection, processing, and shipping protocols. We tested this infrastructure by collecting epidemiologic, medical record, and genomic data from a total of 311 patients with CaP and 218 matched controls recruited at the seven SSA centers. We extracted genomic DNA from whole blood, buffy coat, or buccal swabs from 265 participants and shipped it to the Center for Inherited Disease Research (Baltimore, MD) and the Centre for Proteomics and Genomics Research (Cape Town, South Africa), where genotypes were generated using the UK Biobank Axiom Array.  Results:   We used common instruments for data collection and entered data into the shared database. Double-entered data from pilot participants showed a 95% to 98% concordance rate, suggesting that data can be collected, entered, and stored with a high degree of accuracy. Genotypes were obtained from 95% of tested DNA samples (100% from blood-derived DNA samples) with high concordance across laboratories.

In the absence of prospective clinical trials, sequencing information can be derived from large, real-world registry studies.  Patients and methods:   PROXIMA (Treatment Patterns in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy) is a large, global, prospective registry study evaluating real-world treatment patterns of patients with mCRPC who experience disease progression during or after docetaxel therapy. Patients were enrolled worldwide between 2011 and 2014. Treatments were determined by the treating physicians and recorded in categories of chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and palliative therapy. Treatment sequencing patterns, response to treatment, and types of progression were recorded and analyzed. Progression-free survival and overall survival with different treatment modalities were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Treatment patterns were evaluated in 903 patients. Therapy selection was influenced by region. Hormonal therapy (57.5%) and taxane chemotherapy (26.4%) were the most frequently administered first subsequent treatments after docetaxel. Tumor responses to first subsequent treatment were observed in 22.6% of evaluable patients. Overall survival and progression-free survival did not differ significantly across different treatment modalities.  Conclusion:   Identifying an optimal treatment sequence is vital for improving the care of patients with mCRPC.

Due to simplicity and minimal instrumentation requirement, colloidal-based colorimetric DNA/RNA assays are attractive for driving molecular profiling toward widespread clinical usage. Still, the reliability and speed of current colorimetric assays need to be further improved upon for eventual clinical use. Herein, we propose a ""mix-to-go"" colloidal strategy that utilizes the electrostatic attraction between negatively charged target sequences and positively charged silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to induce aggregation of AgNPs to profile a panel of clinically validated urinary prostate cancer (PCa) RNA biomarkers ( TMPRSS2:ERG, T2:ERG; prostate cancer antigen 3, PCA3; and kallikrein-related peptidase 2, KLK2). Our strategy is unique in inducing a rapid (10 s), unambiguous solution color change in the presence of target sequences, without the additional NP aggregation agents that are used in existing electrostatic-mediated aggregation assays. Our strategy is analytically specific and sensitive for the detection of 105 and 104 target copies by the naked eye and UV-vis spectrophotometry, respectively. Analytical accuracies of our strategy in detecting T2:ERG, PCA3, and KLK2 RNA biomarkers were 95.9%, 97.3%, and 100%, respectively, as validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. To further evaluate clinical molecular profiling performance beyond conventional proof-of-concept demonstration, we tested our colloidal strategy for noninvasive PCa risk prediction of 73 patients, using the urinary RNA biomarker panel comprising of T2:ERG, PCA3, and KLK2. We found that elevated T2:ERG and PCA3 levels were positively associated with high-risk PCa and obtained a corresponding area-under-the-curve values of 0.790 and 0.833 for predicting PCa and high-risk PCa on biopsy, respectively. We believe our ""mix-to-go"" strategy may serve as a reliable and accessible Ag colloidal-based molecular profiling approach for clinical applications.""","""['Jing Wang', 'Kevin M Koo', 'Yuling Wang', 'Matt Trau']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Urine TMPRSS2:ERG Plus PCA3 for Individualized Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment.', 'Incorporation of Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 and TMPRSS2:ERG into Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator.', 'Association Between Combined TMPRSS2:ERG and PCA3 RNA Urinary Testing and Detection of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Blood-based and urinary prostate cancer biomarkers: a review and comparison of novel biomarkers for detection and treatment decisions.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.', 'Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy analysis of mast cell degranulation induced by low-intensity laser.']"""

In the present study, we conducted a two-phase analysis of two independently published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for associations between genetic variants in a complement-related immunity gene-set and overall survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The GWAS dataset from Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was used as the discovery, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression with false-positive report probability for multiple test corrections were performed to evaluate associations between 14,699 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 111 genes and survival of 1,185 NSCLC patients. The identified significant SNPs in a single-locus analysis were further validated with 984 NSCLC patients in the GWAS dataset from the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility (HLCS) Study. The results showed that two independent, potentially functional SNPs in two genes (VWF rs73049469 and ITGB2 rs3788142) were significantly associated with NSCLC survival, with a combined hazards ratio (HR) of 1.22 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07-1.40, P = 0.002] and 1.16 (1.07-1.27, 6.45 × 10-4 ), respectively. Finally, we performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis and found that survival-associated genotypes of VWF rs73049469 were also significantly associated with mRNA expression levels of the gene. These results indicated that genetic variants of the complement-related immunity genes might be predictors of NSCLC survival, particularly for the short-term survival, possibly by modulating the expression of genes involved in the host immunity.""","""['Danwen Qian', 'Hongliang Liu', 'Xiaomeng Wang', 'Jie Ge', 'Sheng Luo', 'Edward F Patz Jr', 'Patricia G Moorman', 'Li Su', 'Sipeng Shen', 'David C Christiani', 'Qingyi Wei']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Potentially functional genetic variants in PLIN2, SULT2A1 and UGT1A9 genes of the ketone pathway and survival of nonsmall cell lung cancer.', 'Potentially functional genetic variants in the TNF/TNFR signaling pathway genes predict survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the PLCO cancer screening trial.', 'Novel genetic variants in KIF16B and NEDD4L in the endosome-related genes are associated with nonsmall cell lung cancer survival.', 'Targeting the Complement Pathway as a Therapeutic Strategy in Lung Cancer.', 'A Decade of GWAS Results in Lung Cancer.', 'Identification of lung adenocarcinoma subtypes and predictive signature for prognosis, immune features, and immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint genes.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in pediatric oncology diagnosis.', 'Artificial intelligence in pancreatic cancer: diagnosis, limitations, and the future prospects-a narrative review.', 'Novel Gene Signatures Predictive of Patient Recurrence-Free Survival and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Novel genetic variants of SYK and ITGA1 related lymphangiogenesis signaling pathway predict non-small cell lung cancer survival.']"""

We identified patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between July 2005 and December 2014 from the Swedish Cancer Registry, and linked them to the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register to ascertain subsequent use of terbinafine. A total of 799 patients received oral treatment of terbinafine during the study period with a mortality rate of 18.6 per 1,000 person-years. Compared to patients who did not use terbinafine and adjusting for a range of confounding factors, patients that received oral treatment of terbinafine had a decreased risk of death from prostate cancer (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38-0.73) and a decreased risk of death overall (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52-0.77). To account for indication bias, we further identified 907 patients who received topical use of terbinafine. However, the risk of death from prostate cancer in patients with topical use of terbinafine was 0.92 (95% CI 0.74-1.12) and the risk of death overall was 1.03 (95% CI 0.91-1.17) as compared to the controls, which suggests that there was no association between risk of death in patients with prostate cancer with topical use of terbinafine.

With more than 100 types of cancers, breast, lung and prostate cancer remain to be the most common types. To identify essential network markers (NMs) and therapeutic targets in these cancers, the authors present a novel approach which uses gene expression data from microarray and RNA-seq platforms and utilises the results from this data to evaluate protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are extracted from microarray data using three different statistical methods in R, to produce a consistent set of genes. Also, DEGs are extracted from RNA-seq data for the same three cancer types. DEG sets found to be common in both platforms are obtained at three fold change (FC) cut-off levels to accurately identify the level of change in expression of these genes in all three cancers. A cancer network is built using PPI data characterising gene sets at log-FC (LFC)>1, LFC>1.5 and LFC>2, and interconnection between principal hub nodes of these networks is observed. Resulting network of hubs at three FC levels highlights prime NMs with high confidence in multiple cancers as validated by Gene Ontology functional enrichment and maximal complete subgraphs from CFinder.""","""['Richa K Makhijani', 'Shital A Raut', 'Hemant J Purohit']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""IET Syst Biol""","""['Identiﬁcation of candidate biomarkers and pathways associated with SCLC by bioinformatics analysis.', 'Identification of prostate cancer hub genes and therapeutic agents using bioinformatics approach.', 'Interaction network analysis of YBX1 for identification of therapeutic targets in adenocarcinomas.', 'Bioinformatics Analysis of Stromal Molecular Signatures Associated with Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'An Integrated Systems Biology and Network-Based Approaches to Identify Novel Biomarkers in Breast Cancer Cell Lines Using Gene Expression Data.', 'Up regulated virulence genes in M. tuberculosis H37Rv gleaned from genome wide expression profiles.', 'A defect in the NOG gene increases susceptibility to spontaneous superficial chronic corneal epithelial defects (SCCED) in boxer dogs.']"""

We recently reported that human prostate cancer can be initiated following oncogene expression in progenitor-like luminal cells marked by low expression of the NAD+-consuming enzyme CD38. CD38 expression is reduced in prostate cancer compared to benign prostate, suggesting that tumor cells may reduce CD38 expression in order to enhance pools of NAD+. However, little is known about how CD38 expression is repressed in advanced prostate cancer and whether CD38 plays a role in regulating NAD+ levels in prostate epithelial cells.  Methods:   CD38 expression, its association with recurrence after prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer, and DNA methylation of the CD38 promoter were evaluated in human prostate tissues representing various stages of disease progression. CD38 was inducibly over-expressed in benign and malignant human prostate cell lines in order to determine the effects on cell proliferation and levels of NAD+ and NADH. NAD+ and NADH were also measured in urogenital tissues from wild-type and CD38 knockout mice.  Results:   CD38 mRNA expression was reduced in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer compared to localized prostate cancer. In a large cohort of men undergoing radical prostatectomy, CD38 protein expression was inversely correlated with recurrence. We identified methylation of the CD38 promoter in primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Over-expression of wild-type CD38, but not an NAD+ hydrolase-deficient mutant, depleted extracellular NAD+ levels in benign and malignant prostate cell lines. However, expression of CD38 did not significantly alter intracellular NAD+ levels in human prostate cell lines grown in vitro and in urogenital tissues isolated from wild-type and CD38 knockout mice.  Conclusions:   CD38 protein expression in prostate cancer is associated with risk of recurrence. Methylation results suggest that CD38 is epigenetically regulated in localized and metastatic prostate cancer tissues. Our study provides support for CD38 as a regulator of extracellular, but not intracellular, NAD+ in epithelial cells. These findings suggest that repression of CD38 by methylation may serve to increase the availability of extracellular NAD+ in prostate cancer tissues.""","""['Jack Mottahedeh', 'Michael C Haffner', 'Tristan R Grogan', 'Takao Hashimoto', 'Preston D Crowell', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Andrea Sboner', 'Rohan Bareja', 'David Esopi', 'William B Isaacs', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Matthew B Rettig', 'David A Elashoff', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Michael A Teitell', 'Andrew S Goldstein']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Cancer Metab""","""['CD38-Induced Apoptosis and Mitochondrial Damage is Restored by Nicotinamide in Prostate Cancer.', 'CD38 Inhibits Prostate Cancer Metabolism and Proliferation by Reducing Cellular NAD+ Pools.', 'Regulation of intracellular levels of NAD: a novel role for CD38.', 'CD38 as a regulator of cellular NAD: a novel potential pharmacological target for metabolic conditions.', 'Role of CD38 in Adipose Tissue: Tuning Coenzyme Availability?', 'Bacterial lipopolysaccharide-related genes are involved in the invasion and recurrence of prostate cancer and are related to immune escape based on bioinformatics analysis.', 'Reversible epigenetic alterations regulate class I HLA loss in prostate cancer.', 'Immune checkpoint modulators in cancer immunotherapy: recent advances and emerging concepts.', 'TNB-738, a biparatopic antibody, boosts intracellular NAD+ by inhibiting CD38 ecto-enzyme activity.', 'CD38-Induced Apoptosis and Mitochondrial Damage is Restored by Nicotinamide in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Intrapatient genomic heterogeneity could be a contributing factor to this clinical heterogeneity. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate genomic heterogeneity in 21 previously treated CRPC metastases from 10 patients to investigate intrapatient molecular heterogeneity (IPMH).Experimental Design: WGS was performed on topographically separate metastases from patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer. IPMH of the RB1 gene was identified and further evaluated by FISH and IHC assays.  Results:   WGS identified limited IPMH for putative driver events. However, heterogeneous genomic aberrations of RB1 were detected. We confirmed the presence of these RB1 somatic copy-number aberrations, initially identified by WGS, with FISH, and identified novel structural variants involving RB1 in 6 samples from 3 of these 10 patients (30%; 3/10). WGS uncovered a novel deleterious RB1 structural lesion constituted of an intragenic tandem duplication involving multiple exons and associating with protein loss.

Castration resistance remains the greatest obstacle in PCa clinical therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can migrate into PCa tissues contributing to tumor progression, therefore, in this study we explored the effect of AD on MSC migration to PCa and elicited its importance for the emergence of castration resistance.  Methods:   MSC migration assay was performed in several PCa cells (LNCaP, VCaP, and 22Rv1) using in-vivo and in-vitro approaches. Reactive oxygen species generation was evaluated by fluorescence assay. IL-1β was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and neutralization experiments were conducted using neutralization antibody. Stem markers (CD133, CD44, and SOX2) were quantified by real-time PCR analysis. The concentration of chemokine ligand 5 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and small hairpin RNA was used for functional analyses.  Results:   AD could significantly contribute to PCa recruitment of MSCs in vivo and in vitro. AD-induced oxidative stress could promote the inflammatory response mediated by IL-1β secretion via activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, N-acetylcysteine could significantly inhibit MSC recruitment to PCa sites when AD is performed. Furthermore, we found MSCs could increase stemness of PCa cells via promoting chemokine ligand 5 secretion in the AD condition, and consequently accelerate emergence of castration resistance.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that castration in clinical PCa therapy may elicit oxidative stress in tumor sites, resulting in increased MSC migration and in tumor cell growth in an androgen-independent manner. Blocking MSC migration to the tumor may provide a new potential target to suppress castration-resistant PCa emergence.""","""['Yang Yu', 'Qingyun Zhang', 'Chengzhong Ma', 'Xue Yang', 'Rui Lin', 'Hongxiang Zhang', 'Yan Liu', 'Zhipeng Han', 'Jiwen Cheng']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Stem Cell Res Ther""","""['A Constitutive Intrinsic Inflammatory Signaling Circuit Composed of miR-196b, Meis2, PPP3CC, and p65 Drives Prostate Cancer Castration Resistance.', 'RELA is sufficient to mediate interleukin-1 repression of androgen receptor expression and activity in an LNCaP disease progression model.', 'Low level laser (LLL) attenuate LPS-induced inflammatory responses in mesenchymal stem cells via the suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway in vitro.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Focus on the tumor microenvironment: A seedbed for neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Mesenchymal/stromal stem cells: necessary factors in tumour progression.', 'Prostate luminal progenitor cells: from mouse to human, from health to disease.', 'Chronic IL-1 Exposed AR+ PCa Cell Lines Show Conserved Loss of IL-1 Sensitivity and Evolve Both Conserved and Unique Differential Gene Expression Profiles.', 'Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Migrate toward Hormone-Insensitive Prostate Tumor Cells Expressing TGF-β via N-Cadherin.']"""

This method is also popularly used to isolate the cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells based on their unique anchorage-independent growth or anoikis-resistant capacity. Different non-adhesive coating agents, such as poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (poly-HEMA) and synthetic hydrogels, have been used in this non-adherent 3D culture. However, preparation of non-adherent culture-ware is labor-intensive and technically demanding, and also costs of commercial non-adherent culture-ware prepared with various coating agents are relatively expensive and the culture-ware cannot be used repeatedly.  Methods:   In this study, we developed a non-adherent 3D culture method based on agar coating for growing tumor spheres derived from various cancer cell lines and primary prostate cancer tissues under a non-adherent and serum-free condition. The tumor spheres generated by this 3D culture method were analyzed on their expression profiles of CSC-associated markers by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, presence and relative proportion of CSCs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (CD133+/CD44+ cell sorting) and also a CSC-visualizing reporter system responsive to OCT4 and SOX2 (SORE6), and in vivo tumorigenicity. The repeated use of agar-coated plates for serial passages of tumor spheres was also evaluated.  Results:   Our results validated that the multicellular tumor spheres generated by this culture method were enriched of CSCs, as evidenced by their enhanced expression profiles of CSC markers, presence of CD133+/CD44+ or SORE6+ cells, enhanced self-renewal capacity, and in vivo tumorigenicity, indicating its usefulness in isolation and enrichment of CSCs. The agar-coated plates could be used multiple times in serial passages of tumor spheres.  Conclusions:   The described agar-based 3D culture method offers several advantages as compared with other methods in isolation of CSCs, including its simplicity and low-cost and repeated use of agar-coated plates for continuous passages of CSC-enriched spheres.""","""['Weijie Gao', 'Dinglan Wu', 'Yuliang Wang', 'Zhu Wang', 'Chang Zou', 'Yong Dai', 'Chi-Fai Ng', 'Jeremy Yuen-Chun Teoh', 'Franky Leung Chan']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Stem Cell Res Ther""","""['Enrichment of cancer stem cells by agarose multi-well dishes and 3D spheroid culture.', 'Hyaluronic acid hydrogels with defined crosslink density for the efficient enrichment of breast cancer stem cells.', 'A novel adherent culture method of glioblastoma cells expressing CD133 using collagen-1-coated plates.', 'Tumor-derived spheroids: Relevance to cancer stem cells and clinical applications.', 'Cancer Stem Cells - Are Surface Markers Alone Sufficient?', 'Effects of growth factor deprivation on MKN-45 spheroid cells.', 'RAB27B Drives a Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype in NSCLC Cells Through Enhanced Extracellular Vesicle Secretion.', 'Surface roughness modulates EGFR signaling and stemness of triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Induced resistance to ifosfamide in osteosarcoma cells suggests a more aggressive tumor profile.', 'Targeting cancer stem cells with polymer nanoparticles for gastrointestinal cancer treatment.']"""

We aim to create an integrated approach that addresses the needs of the general population and the special concerns of cancer survivors. Building on previous research, we will develop, implement, and test the effectiveness of an approach that proactively targets patients to attend an individualized CCDPS intervention delivered by a Prevention Practitioner (PP). The objective is to determine if patients randomized to receive an individualized PP visit (vs standard care) have improved cancer surveillance and CCDPS outcomes. Implementation frameworks will help identify and address facilitators and barriers to the approach and inform future dissemination and uptake.  Methods/design:   The BETTER WISE project is a pragmatic two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial embedded in a mixed methods design, including a qualitative evaluation and an economic assessment. The intervention, informed by the expanded chronic care model and previous research, will be refined by engaging researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and patients. The BETTER WISE tool kit includes blended care pathways for cancer survivors (breast, colorectal, prostate) and CCDPS including lifestyle risk factors and screening for poverty. Patients aged 40-65, including both cancer survivors and general population patients, will be randomized at the physician level to an intervention group or to a wait-list control group. Once the intervention is completed, patients randomized to wait-list control will be invited to receive a prevention visit. The main outcome, calculated at 12-months follow-up, will be an individual patient-level summary composite index, defined as the proportion of CCDPS actions achieved relative to those for which the patient was eligible at baseline. A qualitative evaluation will capture information related to program outcome, implementation (facilitators and barriers), and sustainability. An economic assessment will examine the projected cost-benefit impact of investing in the BETTER WISE approach.  Discussion:   This project builds on existing work and engages end users throughout the process to develop, implement, and determine the effectiveness of a multi-faceted intervention that addresses CCDPS and cancer survivorship in primary care settings.

As two subgroups of ncRNAs family, micro (mi)RNAs can interact with long non-coding (lnc)RNAs, thereby forming ceRNA network. In this study, miR-448 was expressed higher in NSCLC tissues (P < 0.01) and NSCLC cell lines (P < 0.01). Moreover, low expression of miR-448 predicted poor prognosis for patients with NSCLC (P < 0.001). Functional assays revealed the anti-oncogenic function of miR-448 in NSCLC by inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanically, miR-448 was found to be negatively regulated by lncRNA PRNCR1 (prostate cancer non-coding RNA 1). Moreover, HEY2 (Hairy and enhancer of split-related with YRPW motif protein 2) was demonstrated to be the target mRNA of miR-448 in NSCLC cells. All mechanism experiments revealed that lncRNA PRNCR1 exerted ceRNA function in NSCLC by regulating miR-448 and HEY2. To validate the function of PRNCR1-miR-488-HEY2 network in NSCLC progression, rescue assays were conducted. Taken all together, we confirmed that lncRNA PRNCR1 upregulates HEY2 to promote tumor progression in NSCLC by competitively binding miR-448.""","""['Dezhi Cheng', 'Chunchun Bao', 'Xiuxing Zhang', 'Xinshi Lin', 'Hongou Huang', 'Liang Zhao']""","""[]""","""2018""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Long non-coding RNA PRNCR1 modulates non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and EMT through PRNCR1/miR-126-5p/MTDH axis.', 'Long non-coding RNA linc00673 regulated non-small cell lung cancer proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition by sponging miR-150-5p.', 'Knockdown of LncRNA-XIST Suppresses Proliferation and TGF-β1-Induced EMT in NSCLC Through the Notch-1 Pathway by Regulation of miR-137.', 'Non-coding RNAs as emerging regulators of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Roles of miR-200 family members in lung cancer: more than tumor suppressors.', 'PRNCR1: a long non-coding RNA with a pivotal oncogenic role in cancer.', 'Competing endogenous RNAs in lung cancer.', 'HCG11 up-regulation induced by ELK4 suppressed proliferation in vestibular schwannoma by targeting miR-620/ELK4.', 'lncRNA MAFG-AS1 Contributes to Esophageal Squamous-Cell Carcinoma Progression via Regulating miR143/LASP1.', 'LncRNA PCAT-1 upregulates RAP1A through modulating miR-324-5p and promotes survival in lung cancer.']"""
